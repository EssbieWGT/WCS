The Department for Science, Innovation and Technology has today (Thursday 30 October) confirmed long-term R&D funding for the UK’s research agencies and bodies, with bumper investment for the bodies that are making science and tech breakthroughs that improve lives and grow our economy. These allocations give visibility and clarity on the development of DSIT’s plans for R&D budgets, with the Department’s overall R&D budget growing in real terms.

New analysis published today shows the value of public investment in R&D to the UK – with every £1 spent delivering £8 in net economic benefits over the long-term. Crowding in private investment is a key part of this, with every £1 of public money invested in R&D crowding in a further £2 in private investment, on average.

The Science and Tech Secretary announced today’s allocations while visiting IBM’s London base, to see first-hand how private investment is supporting the strength of the UK’s public offer on R&D, boosting work from quantum to robotics. Publicly-funded UK research has already resulted in some of the most important breakthroughs of recent years, including the first cutting-edge antibody products which have transformed some cancers from a guaranteed death sentence to manageable chronic conditions.

IBM is also working in partnership with publicly-funded researchers through UKRI’s £210 million Hartree Centre, to bring AI, quantum computing and supercomputing to bear to discover new medicines, and breakthroughs in clean energy. While the company is also one of several technology vendors providing access to cutting edge quantum computing resource via the National Quantum Computing Centre - which will benefit from a first-of-its-kind 10-year government funding commitment.

By investing in R&D now, the government is putting a down-payment on Britain’s future that will deliver dividends for decades to come and put money in people’s pockets – delivering on our Plan for Change. We know businesses grow faster because of public R&D. In the 6 years after receiving their first R&D grant funding, employment increases in the average business by 21% and turnover grows by 23% relative to similar firms who didn’t get support. Some of the UK’s most innovative businesses have had public R&D funding help springboard them to success.

Oxford Nanopore, who are developing the world’s first pandemic early warning system, and Cobalt Light Systems, who make the tech that’s used to screen liquids at airports, have both benefitted from UKRI funding in previous years. Today, Oxford Nanopore is a FTSE 250-listed company, while Cobalt Light Systems’ equipment is used in over 70 airports worldwide.

Science and Technology Secretary Liz Kendall said:

Backing our best and brightest researchers and innovators is essential. They are making the impossible, possible, from health to clean energy and beyond. Their ideas will create tomorrow’s industries, boosting growth and transforming public services now and in the future.

By investing in their work, we are backing the long-term success of the UK, by paving the way for breakthroughs that will help us all to live and work better.

Publicly-funded research makes a difference to everyone’s health, wealth and wellbeing, with examples from the last year including:

£129 million in government support for BioNTech, who are setting up UK R&D centres to advance innovative cancer medicines and in turn unlocking £1 private billion investment over 10 years

£80 million for 100 nationwide research projects ranging from better prosthetics, to better tests for blood clots

£44 million to put technologies like AI and engineering biology to work, to make manufacturing cleaner, less wasteful, and less reliant on fossil fuels

£32 million for novel medical scanners which are up to 40 times more sensitive and up to 10 times faster than existing machines, to help diagnose cancer and heart conditions

£19.6 million for developing cutting-edge materials for the next generation of computers and medical scanners

Over £22 million for work to make usable quantum computers a reality, which can discover new medicines and treatments in a fraction of the time and cost it takes today

R&D is also at the heart of around 3 million jobs in the UK, with the power to create many more as discoveries advance.

British quantum firm Oxford Quantum Circuits, meanwhile - founded off the back of public-funded research - has gone on to raise $100 million Series B and deploy the first ever quantum computer in New York City.

The R&D funding being confirmed today, covering the Spending Review period ending 2029/2030, includes:

UKRI, the UK’s national funding agency for science and research, will deliver more than £38 billion across the period, including nearly £10 billion in 2029/2030 alone

The budget for ARIA – the UK’s agency backing bold, long-term breakthroughs – to rise from £220 million a year to £400 million a year by 2029/2030. One area that ARIA is supporting, is how robots could potentially help meet the growing need for adult social care

Over £1.4 billion total backing for the Met Office, to keep the UK at the forefront of climate science

Over £900 million total backing for the UK’s prestigious National Academies

Over £550 million for the National Measurement System, and £240 million for the AI Security Institute

All these allocations will support vital investment in universities, research institutes, and businesses across the UK

DSIT’s overall R&D budget will grow in real terms over the Spending Review period, totalling £58.5 billion from 2026/2027 to 2029/2030.

The funding being confirmed today comes from the transformative £86 billion for public R&D confirmed by the Chancellor at the Spending Review, £55 billion of which is being detailed today. Funding for some further R&D programmes will be confirmed in due course.

Notes to editors

Further information will be published later this year, including more detail on UKRI’s budgets and more information on the outcomes the funding will support.

Every few years, a new administration tries to steer the course of the energy transition by decree. Some do it by boosting clean technologies through subsidies and regulation. Others try to restore fossil fuel dominance by dismantling those same supports. The idea that a single political cycle can redirect a century-long industrial transformation is a comforting myth for those who still see energy as a matter of ideology rather than physics and economics. The United States in 2025 is reliving that pattern. Donald Trump’s return to office brought immediate efforts to roll back clean-energy policies, cut federal incentives, and revive coal and oil narratives that predate the iPhone. Yet the structural momentum of the clean-energy transition remains. The cost curves are still falling, factories are still being built, and the global supply chain for electrons and metals has become too integrated to unravel. Trump can slow it, but he cannot stop it.

The fundamental driver of this transition is not a line of legislation or a presidential signature. It is the compound effect of innovation, scale, and learning. Solar module costs have dropped over 90% since 2010, wind turbine efficiency keeps improving, and lithium-ion batteries—once exotic and expensive—are now a basic industrial commodity. Once technologies reach that point, policy resistance can only delay deployment, not reverse it. Investors follow returns, and the returns on clean energy continue to outcompete new fossil fuel capacity in most markets. The United States can pause its own acceleration, but the rest of the world is still pressing ahead, and cost parity ensures that even delayed domestic markets will eventually follow.

The clearest illustration of that structural inertia is the Battery Belt now stretching across the American Midwest and Southeast. Over the past five years, the United States has announced or begun construction on well over 800 GWh of battery cell capacity. Even with a few cancellations, the buildout remains historic. From Ultium’s Ohio and Tennessee plants to Ford and SK’s twin campuses in Kentucky and Toyota’s growing complex in North Carolina, the scale is beyond anything envisioned a decade ago. Each of these projects is measured not in months but in years, with multibillion-dollar contracts, local tax incentives, and state-level workforce programs binding them to completion. Once the rebar is in and the equipment ordered, a policy speech in Washington cannot unwind that momentum.

The Trump administration’s 2025 reversals have been sweeping on paper. The United States withdrew again from the Paris Agreement, the Environmental Protection Agency reopened dozens of climate and pollution rules, and the One Big Beautiful Bill Act set out to phase down the Inflation Reduction Act’s clean-energy tax credits. Electric vehicle subsidies are scheduled to expire, home electrification grants are being clawed back, and billions in clean-energy projects were canceled in politically unfriendly states. Each move serves the narrative of “energy dominance” through extraction rather than innovation. The short-term effect is real: slower grid-scale battery deployment, canceled hydrogen hub buildouts (mostly thankfully), and frozen grant disbursements for rooftop solar and community energy storage. But none of this changes the economics of electrons or the global competition for clean-technology manufacturing.

The practical damage will be most visible at the margins. Second-tier startups and regional battery suppliers, already stretched thin, may lose the federal incentives that made their financing viable. Some smaller plants may close or consolidate. Grid operators may find fewer domestic suppliers of stationary storage modules, and some renewable developers will again look abroad for battery imports. Investors, wary of political volatility, will demand higher returns, raising the cost of capital. These are frictions, not fatal blows. Most of the large joint ventures—Ultium, BlueOval SK, Panasonic, Toyota, Hyundai–LG—are continuing as planned, because their global supply contracts depend on them.

The deeper reason Trump cannot stop the transition is that it has already outgrown politics. The clean-energy economy is now market-led, not policy-forced. Utilities choose renewables because they are cheaper to build and easier to permit. Automakers are committed to electrification because global emissions rules and consumer demand require it. Capital markets have priced carbon risk into valuations. International partners, from Korea to Europe, continue to invest in US manufacturing even when the federal tone shifts. The energy transition has become a self-reinforcing industrial ecosystem: factories create suppliers, suppliers create jobs, jobs create local pressure to keep the plants open. Each new battery campus or wind-turbine blade facility becomes a constituency for staying the course.

Battery manufacturing itself is a perfect case study. Once a company breaks ground on a 30 or 40 GWh plant, cancellation becomes irrational. The construction alone takes years. Supply contracts for cathode materials and separators span half a decade. Every piece of equipment ordered locks in sunk costs that no administration can claw back. Even paused projects tend to reemerge when market conditions stabilize or new policy incentives appear. In practice, each gigafactory becomes a monument to irreversible industrial change. The policy pendulum may swing, but the infrastructure keeps growing.

If Trump’s actions slow the transition, the delay will be measured in years, not decades. Analysts estimate that current rollbacks could push the US clean-energy deployment curve back by roughly 100 to 150 GWh of battery capacity by 2030. That matters for domestic competitiveness, but it does not reverse the global trajectory. Europe, China, and India are still expanding manufacturing at a combined pace that dwarfs the US slowdown. Their scale will continue to push technology costs down, indirectly forcing American firms to rejoin the race or lose market share. The transition does not stop when one country blinks; it simply reroutes capital to where it is welcome.

What happens next will test how resilient this new industrial base really is. State governments from Georgia to Michigan are now the front line of clean-energy policy, continuing to court manufacturers with tax breaks and training programs regardless of the federal stance. Corporate commitments to decarbonization, already written into supply contracts and investor reports, will keep capital flowing. Even within the fossil-friendly framing of “energy dominance,” the administration’s focus on mining and critical minerals could inadvertently strengthen the battery supply chain. The path may zigzag, but it still leads toward electrification.

The recent turmoil surrounding South Korean battery projects in the United States has been one of the most visible disruptions of 2025, but even these incidents only dent the surface of the overall trend. The high-profile case was the Immigration and Customs Enforcement raid at Hyundai and LG Energy Solution’s joint venture in Bryan County, Georgia. Federal agents detained nearly 500 workers, most of them South Korean nationals who were reportedly in the country without valid work visas. The raid briefly halted onsite activity, disrupted subcontractor schedules, and triggered political outrage in both countries. For a few weeks it seemed like a serious threat to one of the Southeast’s flagship clean manufacturing projects.

Yet Hyundai reaffirmed its commitment within days, local authorities stepped in to stabilise the situation, and construction resumed. The factory, designed for roughly 30 GWh of annual battery output, remains a cornerstone of Hyundai’s North American EV strategy. The episode highlighted the vulnerabilities of a globalised workforce under volatile US immigration enforcement, but it did not slow the momentum of the project or the overall trajectory of domestic battery manufacturing. Once capital is committed and equipment procurement has begun, even a large-scale federal intervention can only cause a temporary delay.

A similar story unfolded in Michigan, where two highly publicised projects became political lightning rods. Ford’s planned LFP battery plant in Marshall, built under license from China’s CATL, was paused amid a storm of congressional scrutiny and campaign rhetoric. Lawmakers argued that the licensing arrangement could channel Inflation Reduction Act subsidies to a “foreign entity of concern.” In parallel, Chinese battery maker Gotion’s proposed facility in Big Rapids was effectively cancelled after local political opposition and the withdrawal of state incentives. Both cases generated headlines about the supposed collapse of US battery investment.

In practice, they represent a narrow category of politically sensitive projects rather than a systemic reversal. Ford’s decision to pause its plant reflects risk management in a political cycle, not a retreat from electrification. The company still has tens of billions invested in BlueOval SK joint ventures and is locked into an EV supply chain that demands more domestic cells. Gotion’s cancellation was a casualty of geopolitical optics, but the lost capacity—tens of GWh at most—is marginal compared to the hundreds of GWh still advancing nationwide.

Together, these two stories show how visible setbacks can distort perception. The ICE raid and Michigan factory cancellations are reminders that politics and public sentiment can complicate individual projects, but they do not change the underlying math of the transition. The cost trajectories of batteries, the commitments of automakers, and the sheer volume of capital already deployed mean the broader buildout continues. Each gigafactory represents a long-term industrial bet that will outlast any administration’s enforcement choices or rhetoric about “foreign control.” The political shocks of 2025 have slowed the timeline in a few locations, but the physics of the energy economy remain the same: batteries are still getting cheaper, factories are still rising, and electrification is still spreading.

Politics can redirect budgets and narratives, but it cannot undo the math. The cost of solar and wind keeps dropping. Battery energy density keeps improving. Every gigafactory under construction today has an operational life well beyond any administration. Trump can pause some credits, cancel some projects, and reignite an old cultural fight over fossil fuels, but he cannot rewrite the physics or the economics of modern energy. The energy transition has already passed the point where it depends on belief. It now depends on arithmetic, and arithmetic has no ideology.

Trump can slow America’s progress toward that future, but he cannot stop it. The rest of the world will keep building, learning, and scaling. In the end, the transition will roll forward, powered not by political will but by simple inevitability. The only real question is whether the United States keeps up or watches from behind as others claim the markets and industries of the next century.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ChatGPT-Image-Oct-29-2025-01_29_10-PM-800x445.png,N,,2025-10-29 19:59:18.634730

But a new study says that EVs quickly make up for that with less overall emissions through two years of use than a gas-powered vehicle.

The study also estimated that gas-powered vehicles cause at least twice as much environmental damage over their lifetimes as EVs, and said the benefits of EVs can be expected to increase in coming decades as clean sources of power, such as solar and wind, are brought onto the grid.

The work by researchers from Northern Arizona University and Duke University, published Wednesday in the journal PLOS Climate, offers insight into a transportation sector that makes up a big part of U.S. emissions. It also comes as some EV skeptics have raised concerns about whether the environmental impact of battery production, including mining, makes it worthwhile to switch to electric.

“While there is a bigger carbon footprint in the very short term because of the manufacturing process in creating the batteries for electric vehicles, very quickly you come out ahead in CO2 emissions by year three and then for all of the rest of the vehicle lifetime, you’re far ahead and so cumulatively much lower carbon footprint,” said Drew Shindell, an earth science professor at Duke University and study co-author.

What the researchers examined

The researchers evaluated several harmful air pollutants monitored by the Environmental Protection Agency, as well as emissions data, to compare the relative impact over time of EVs and internal combustion engines on air quality and climate change.

Their analysis said that EVs produce 30% higher carbon dioxide emissions than gasoline vehicles in their first two years. That can be attributed to the energy-intensive production and manufacturing processes involved in mining lithium for EV batteries.

They also sought to account for how the U.S. energy system might develop in coming years, assuming growth in clean energy. And they modeled four different scenarios for EV adoption, ranging from the lowest — a 31% share of vehicle sales — to the highest, 75% of sales, by 2050. (EV sales accounted for about 8% of new vehicle sales in the U.S. in 2024.)

The researchers said the average of those four models found that for each additional kilowatt hour of lithium-ion battery output, carbon dioxide emissions drop by an average of 220 kilograms (485 pounds) in 2030, and another 127 kilograms (280 pounds) in 2050.

The consistent decrease in CO2 emissions from EVs is “not only driven by the on-road vehicles, but also reduction that has been brought due to electricity production,” said lead author Pankaj Sadavarte, a postdoctoral researcher at Northern Arizona University.

Greg Keoleian, a University of Michigan professor of sustainable systems who wasn’t involved in the research, called it a “valuable study” that echoes other findings and “confirms the environmental and economic benefits” of EVs.

“Accelerating the adoption of battery electric vehicles is a key strategy for decarbonizing the transportation sector which will reduce future damages and costs of climate change,” he said.

Researchers take optimistic view of the grid’s future

Shindell, the Duke researcher, said the grid will evolve to have more solar and wind power.

“When you add a bunch of electric vehicles, nobody’s going to build new coal-fired power plants to run these things because coal is really expensive compared to renewables,” he said. “So the grid just overall becomes much cleaner in both the terms of carbon emissions for climate change, and for air pollution.”

Outside experts agreed — as long as the policy landscape supports it. That hasn’t been the case under President Donald Trump, who has worked to boost fossil fuels and restrain solar and wind power development.

“The great news is the rest of the world isn’t slowing down in terms of its embrace of this technology,” said Ellen Kennedy, principal for carbon-free transportation at RMI, a clean energy nonprofit. As for the U.S., she said, “I think it’s important to keep in mind states and local governments, there’s a lot that’s happening on those fronts.”

One thing the study didn’t address was recycling or disposal of batteries at the end of their life. Kennedy said battery recycling will improve, helping to address one of the environmental impacts of their production.

A challenging time for EVs in the United States

The study comes at a notable time given the challenges that EVs face in the U.S.

EVs have seen more interest in recent years as an alternative to gas-powered cars and trucks — particularly as they become more affordable and charging infrastructure becomes more available.

But growth has slowed amid shifting federal policy toward EVs and an industry step back from ambitious EV production promises.

Former President Joe Biden set a target for 50% of all new vehicle sales in the U.S. to be electric by 2030. But Trump reversed that policy, and Congress has terminated federal tax credits for an EV purchase. The administration has also targeted vehicle pollution rules that would encourage greater uptake of EVs in the U.S., and the president has attempted to halt a nationwide EV charging buildout.

“The study is important to show how really misguided the current administration’s policies are,” Shindell said. “If we want to protect us from climate change and from the very clear and local damage from poor air quality, this is a really clear way to do it: Incentivize the switch from internal combustion engines to EVs.”

Whether it’s a commercial facility, office complex, or manufacturing site, upgrading an existing structure often provides a more efficient, environmentally responsible, and financially sustainable solution than starting anew.","SLIDELL, LA, UNITED STATES, October 29, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- Across Southeast Louisiana, businesses and property owners are increasingly reevaluating how to expand or modernize their facilities. The decision between new construction and renovation often depends on cost, location, and long-term functionality. In many cases, renovating an existing structure provides a practical alternative that preserves investment value while adapting to current needs.

At Jaymar Construction LLC in Slidell, Louisiana, years of field experience have shown that renovation projects, when approached strategically, can deliver efficiency and renewed performance without the cost or disruption of starting from the ground up. According to Jules Albert III, owner of the company, knowing when a building is ready for renovation begins with understanding its bones. “A well-built structure doesn’t always need to be replaced,” Albert explained. “If the foundation, framing, and core systems remain strong, the smarter move is often to renew what already exists.”

Evaluating the Existing Structure

Every facility reaches a point where maintenance and operational demands outpace its original design. Aging mechanical systems, outdated layouts, and changing safety codes eventually require major intervention. The first step is a structural evaluation.

In Southeast Louisiana, environmental conditions play a large role in determining whether renovation is feasible. High humidity, shifting soil, and seasonal storms can wear down exterior materials and compromise foundations. However, many commercial and industrial structures in the region were built with reinforced concrete or steel frames—materials that age well with proper maintenance.

A structural engineer’s assessment provides clarity about which components remain sound and which require replacement. If the core framing, foundation, and roof structure are intact, renovation becomes a viable path forward.

Cost Considerations

New construction often carries higher upfront expenses than renovation. Site preparation, permitting, and infrastructure installation all add significant cost before vertical work even begins. Renovation projects, by contrast, can often leverage existing utilities, foundations, and access points.

That said, renovation costs vary depending on the complexity of the project and the extent of hidden damage. Electrical, plumbing, and HVAC systems in older buildings may require full upgrades to meet current code standards. Factoring in contingencies for these updates ensures financial stability throughout the process.

A careful cost analysis should compare not only the immediate price of renovation versus new construction but also long-term operational efficiency. Retrofitting energy-efficient lighting, HVAC, and insulation during renovation can reduce utility expenses and improve sustainability without the higher cost of starting new.

Zoning, Permits, and Local Regulation

Zoning and permitting play a critical role in determining whether renovation is more practical than building new. In many Louisiana parishes, zoning restrictions or space limitations prevent expansion beyond an existing footprint. Renovation allows adaptation within those boundaries while maintaining compliance.

Historic districts and waterfront properties, in particular, often face additional regulations. In these cases, modifying an existing structure can provide a path forward that honors local design standards while meeting modern performance needs.

Permitting timelines also tend to be shorter for renovations, as many projects qualify as improvements rather than new development. This advantage reduces downtime and allows faster occupancy once work is complete.

Functional Modernization

Facilities designed decades ago often reflect work habits and equipment that no longer exist. Renovation provides an opportunity to reconfigure layouts, improve workflow, and integrate technology.

In manufacturing and commercial settings, open floor plans can replace segmented rooms to accommodate larger equipment or collaborative workspaces. In office buildings, modern renovations often focus on improving natural light, sound insulation, and air circulation—all factors that enhance productivity and comfort.

Technology upgrades are another key aspect. Updating wiring, data cabling, and energy systems ensures compatibility with modern automation and digital infrastructure. Even simple improvements like LED lighting and motion sensors can dramatically improve energy efficiency while reducing maintenance demands.

Sustainability and Environmental Responsibility

Sustainability has become an important factor in facility planning. Renovating an existing building minimizes environmental impact by reducing the waste and energy consumption associated with demolition and new material production.

Reusing materials such as structural steel, masonry, or concrete not only preserves embodied energy but also reduces transportation emissions. Integrating green building practices—such as low-VOC finishes, water-efficient fixtures, and advanced insulation—creates healthier indoor environments while reducing operational costs.

In coastal Louisiana, where environmental preservation is an ongoing concern, sustainable renovation aligns with community priorities and long-term resilience goals.

Minimizing Disruption to Operations

One of the biggest advantages of renovation over new construction is the ability to phase work around ongoing operations. Many commercial and industrial projects can be completed in stages, allowing sections of a facility to remain functional while upgrades occur elsewhere.

This phased approach requires precise planning and coordination but reduces overall downtime. Employees and tenants can continue working without full relocation, saving both time and logistical expense.

Scheduling construction during off-peak hours, weekends, or slower business periods further minimizes disruption. For organizations that rely on continuous operation, this flexibility can be the deciding factor in choosing renovation over replacement.

Preserving Community and Identity

In Louisiana, buildings often hold cultural and historical value beyond their physical use. Many commercial properties have stood through generations of business and community change. Renovation allows these landmarks to evolve without losing their identity.

Modernizing older structures maintains the connection between past and present while extending the lifespan of properties that define local character. It also supports economic stability by revitalizing established business districts instead of relocating them.

For growing communities across St. Tammany Parish, Slidell, and the Northshore region, facility renovation provides a practical path toward progress without sacrificing familiarity.

Knowing When to Renovate

Not every building is a candidate for renovation, but many that appear outdated still possess strong potential. When structural integrity remains sound, and when the site continues to serve a strategic purpose, renovation offers a balanced approach between modernization and preservation.

The key lies in early evaluation. Thorough inspection, accurate budgeting, and clear communication between engineers, architects, and contractors ensure that all options are considered before major decisions are made.

A well-planned renovation not only updates the physical space but also revitalizes its purpose. Whether it’s a commercial facility, office complex, or manufacturing site, upgrading an existing structure often provides a more efficient, environmentally responsible, and financially sustainable solution than starting anew.

The low-cost technology being developed by Brayton Energy will add capacity to the power grid by storing energy and dispatching it during times of high demand or unreliability. Regardless of fuel source, energy storage is a valuable tool for addressing challenges facing our grid.”

The delegation concluded, “We urge you to reinstate this financial award to Brayton Energy so it can continue its work to improve grid reliability and strengthen American manufacturing.”

Debra Pannell, a spokeswoman for Appalachian Power, said the performance of the company’s coal fleet aligns with the average performance in PJM, a 13-state regional grid that includes both states.
Pannell said Appalachian Power did not receive any penalties in PJM for the failure of Amos 2.
In a winter storm over Christmas weekend 2022, Amos Unit 3 was down for a week because of a boiler tube leak, while Unit 1 was down for planned maintenance.
The unit’s breakdown cost Mon Power $40.5 million in performance penalties, according to testimony to the West Virginia Public Service Commission.","Appalachian Power’s John Amos power plant is the biggest in West Virginia.

Data the company provided to utility regulators in Virginia show one of the plant’s three units failed on Jan. 21 and 22. This was during one of the coldest periods of the year, with record demand for electricity in the region.

The data show that 800-megawatt Unit 2 failed for 28 hours on those two days. The outage was recorded as unplanned. The unit was not scheduled for maintenance.

Coal’s supporters point to its reliability in extreme weather events like those in January. Seth Feaster, an energy analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, says older plants like Amos are vulnerable to unpredictable breakdowns.

“A plant, like Amos, that is having these outages, is supposed to be reliable,” he said. “They’re getting millions of dollars for being a reliable plant that can deliver power when the grid needs it, and instead, they’re not paying a penalty, but the plant isn’t available either.”

Amos first went online in 1971 and supplies power to West Virginia and Virginia. Debra Pannell, a spokeswoman for Appalachian Power, said the performance of the company’s coal fleet aligns with the average performance in PJM, a 13-state regional grid that includes both states.

Pannell said Appalachian Power did not receive any penalties in PJM for the failure of Amos 2.

In a winter storm over Christmas weekend 2022, Amos Unit 3 was down for a week because of a boiler tube leak, while Unit 1 was down for planned maintenance. Only Unit 2 operated.

Mon Power lost its 684-megawatt Harrison Unit 2 during the 2022 winter event. The unit’s breakdown cost Mon Power $40.5 million in performance penalties, according to testimony to the West Virginia Public Service Commission.

It turns out that Amos 2 was not needed to meet the high demand in January.

“So they got lucky,” Feaster said.

Days later, Amos 2 broke down again for more than 19 days in February.",https://wvpublic.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Amos-02-jpg.jpg,N,,2025-10-29 18:19:33.936924

But even as Equinor said it was sticking with offshore wind, company executives made clear there are limits to their support.
Equinor nevertheless is sticking with offshore wind, unlike fellow European oil majors like BP and Shell.
“The offshore wind industry is living through its first real downturn with a lot of challenges,” Reitan said.","The shifting winds of the Trump-era energy transition were on full display during Equinor’s quarterly earnings call today.

The Norwegian oil and gas giant said it has finished installing foundations at Empire Wind, a massive offshore wind project off New York that President Donald Trump temporarily halted earlier this year. It also signaled it intends to play a more active role at Ørsted after buying more shares in the troubled Danish offshore wind developer.

But even as Equinor said it was sticking with offshore wind, company executives made clear there are limits to their support.

Equinor will invest little money in the industry beyond its three projects in construction: Empire Wind in the U.S., Dogger Bank off the United Kingdom and Baltyk in Poland.

A company official also expressed hesitancy about investing in the power sector more broadly, even as vast amounts of capital pour into the industry to meet the needs of electricity-hungry data centers. Equinor is a large gas producer and recently established a business division to evaluate power sector investments. But unlike its reaction to the green energy bubble five years ago, the company’s chief financial officer made clear Equinor is not planning to jump headlong into the electricity business anytime soon.

“I have to be very clear that we have no intentions to significantly step up investments into this area,” Torgrim Reitan said, after a financial analyst asked if the company would redeploy money once earmarked for offshore wind to other investments in the power sector.

Oil prices are down, he noted, making it “very important” for the company to be cautious about how it spends its money.

Equinor is a key barometer of the energy transition. The Norwegian company was among a wave of European-based oil companies to plunge into renewable energy five years ago, only to pull back when the sector failed to generate the kind of profits oil companies are accustomed to.

Reitan’s comments are notable because they come at a time when Wall Street is dumping money into utilities to meet the electricity needs of artificial intelligence. They signal that after being burned by investments in renewable energy over the last five years, Equinor is wary of investing in electricity generation, which has a fundamentally different business model than oil and gas production.

Equinor nevertheless is sticking with offshore wind, unlike fellow European oil majors like BP and Shell.

Reitan’s comments about Equinor’s decision to maintain a 10 percent stake in Ørsted showcased how the oil giant is thinking about the industry.

“The offshore wind industry is living through its first real downturn with a lot of challenges,” Reitan said. “We also do think that this industry needs consolidation. We do think that a closer collaboration industrially and strategically between Ørsted and ourselves.”

He added: “In the current environment, we are going to limit sort of capital commitments into offshore wind. It is an industry that is challenged.”

Hurricane Melissa

Hurricane Melissa made landfall this morning in Cuba, after causing major damage in Jamaica yesterday as one of the strongest storms to form in the Atlantic. The storm’s trail of destruction left dozens dead and knocked out power to 70 percent of Jamaica.

As Chelsea Harvey writes, climate change fueled the hurricane’s record-breaking rampage. One new analysis found that unusually warm ocean waters boosted the storm’s rapid intensification — twice.

Power Centers

EPA pays some, furloughs others

The Environmental Protection Agency is taking an unprecedented approach to furloughs during the government shutdown, using billions of dollars in carryover funds to keep on staff that support the president’s priority projects, write Ellie Borst and Jean Chemnick.

EPA had $44.9 billion in total budgetary resources available to use starting Oct. 1 — an abnormally high amount for an agency with a $9 billion annual budget. EPA owes its reserves to a wave of programmatic reductions under the Trump administration, paired with substantial funding from Biden-era spending laws.

In recent weeks, agency staff who work in areas that the Trump administration has deprioritized — like emissions reporting and grants — have been sent home without pay until the shutdown ends. Virtually everyone who is working to undo marquee Biden-era regulations for air pollution, climate change and water quality is still on the job, according to EPA staff and outside observers who engage with them.

Trump’s energy bet

The U.S. and China’s divergent paths on energy will be on display Thursday when Trump meets Chinese President Xi Jinping, Benjamin Storrow and Sara Schonhardt write.

Trump has put fossil fuels at the center of his energy policy, while China has become a clean energy superpower under Xi. Both countries are targeting Asian markets for exports.

“The U.S. and China, moving forward, are trying to sell rival energy export models with the U.S. built around fossil fuels and the Chinese built around cheap renewables,” said Gregory Brew, an energy analyst at the Eurasia Group. “It’s unclear who’s going to come out ahead.”

Zombie pipeline?

American and Canadian leaders are mulling a revival of the long-dead Keystone XL oil pipeline, write Carlos Anchondo and Mike Soraghan.

Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney raised the prospect of pursuing the project this month in a meeting with Trump. Since then, however, the countries’ relationship has soured over an Ontario ad campaign that blasted U.S. tariffs, delaying any public push to reboot the project.

But if the trade war between the two countries cools, the Keystone XL project could be used as “a cornerstone of a large deal,” said Christopher Sands, director of Johns Hopkins University’s Center for Canadian Studies.

Not deterred: Hyundai says it is still planning to invest $6 billion in a low-carbon steel plant in Louisiana, despite Trump administration cuts to tax credits and an immigration raid at a Georgia factory.

The Honorable Dan Sullivan

United States Senate

706 Hart Senate Office Building

Washington, D.C. 20510

Dear Senator Sullivan:

On behalf of the National Federation of Independent Business, I write in support of S.J. Res. 80, which would repeal a Bureau of Land Management (BLM)’s “National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska (NPR-A) Integrated Activity Plan Record of Decision” that restricted development on 23-million-acres of Alaska, which is approximately equivalent in size to the state of Indiana. Repealing this BLM rule is an important step in lowering energy costs for small business owners not just in Alaska, but across the whole country.

NFIB represents approximately 300,000 small and independent businesses across the United States, including more than 1,000 in the state of Alaska. In NFIB’s most recent Problems and Priorities survey, small businesses ranked the cost of natural gas, propane, gasoline, diesel, and fuel oil as their 6th most pressing issue.1 Job creators depend on affordable, reliable, American energy so they can own, operate, and grow their small businesses.

The NPR-A was originally set aside by the U.S. Navy in 1923 as an emergency oil reserve. Today, BLM is responsible for setting an “expeditious program of competitive leasing of oil and gas” in the area. At Congress’ directive, the NPR-A is expressly meant to facilitate domestic energy production. Yet, BLM’s 2022 Integrated Activity Plan (IAP) explicitly disregarded this mandate. The 2022 IAP closed 52% of the NPR-A to leasing, and restricted infrastructure across millions of acres of land, despite opposition from local Alaskan communities and national energy experts.

In a recent NFIB member ballot, 88% of NFIB members supported Congress streamlining regulations on the production and transportation of energy sources.2 Repealing this burdensome BLM rule would do just that, allowing for the production of more American energy on land owned by the taxpayer.

NFIB supports repealing this burdensome rule and other rules that increase production costs and make energy less affordable and reliable for small businesses. We look forward to working with you to advance this bill and help ensure continued American energy dominance.

Sincerely,

Louis A. Bertolotti

The cuts represent one of the most significant workforce reductions in the industry since the $7,500 EV incentive ended on September 30, 2025.

The layoffs come just one week after GM CEO Mary Barra told shareholders that electric vehicles “remain our North Star” during the company’s third-quarter earnings call, raising questions about the disconnect between GM’s public commitment to electrification and its actual manufacturing priorities.

Detroit EV Plant Cuts Production In Half

GM confirmed to the Detroit News that approximately 1,200 workers at its Factory Zero electric vehicle assembly plant in Detroit will be laid off indefinitely starting in January 2026. The facility, which currently operates on two shifts, will drop to a single shift, cutting production capacity by roughly 50 percent.

Factory Zero produces GM’s most expensive electric vehicles, including the Chevrolet Silverado EV, GMC Sierra EV, Cadillac Escalade IQ, and GMC Hummer EV. The plant typically runs on two shifts to meet demand, but according to NBC News, the reduced schedule reflects “slower near-term EV adoption and an evolving regulatory environment.”

The Detroit plant had previously faced workforce adjustments earlier in 2025, but this represents the most severe production cut since the facility converted to all-electric vehicle manufacturing.

Battery Plants With LG Energy Solution Going Idle

Beyond the Detroit assembly plant, GM is temporarily idling battery cell production at two critical facilities operated through its joint venture with South Korea’s LG Energy Solution. The Ultium Cells plant in Warren, Ohio will see 550 workers laid off indefinitely, with another 850 facing temporary layoffs. In Spring Hill, Tennessee, 700 workers at the second Ultium Cells facility will be temporarily laid off.

GM told CNBC that “battery cell production at the Spring Hill, Tennessee and Warren, Ohio facilities will be temporarily paused beginning January 2026.”

The company anticipates resuming operations at both battery cell sites by mid-2026 and plans to use the pause to upgrade its facilities.

The timing couldn’t be worse for GM’s battery ambitions. The automaker has invested more than $2 billion in each of these facilities, betting heavily on vertical integration to control battery costs and secure supply chains. The pause in production suggests demand has fallen far short of expectations following the tax credit expiration.

Additional job cuts will hit two other Michigan sites. GM’s Pontiac Metal Center, a stamping plant that supplies parts for Factory Zero, will temporarily lay off 45 workers. Rochester Operations in New York, which makes electric vehicle battery cooling lines supplied to Factory Zero, will temporarily idle 74 employees. Both actions take effect November 17.

Tax Credit Expiration Triggers Industry Collapse

The September 30, 2025 expiration of the $7,500 federal EV tax credit has dramatically reshaped the American electric vehicle market. Congress eliminated the incentive through President Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill,” cutting short a program that was originally scheduled to run through 2032.

The tax credit’s removal created a brief surge in third-quarter sales as buyers rushed to purchase before the deadline, but industry analysts predicted a sharp decline would follow. According to Reuters, GM’s layoffs are “in response to slower near-term EV adoption and an evolving regulatory environment.”

A study from UC Berkeley, Duke University, and Stanford University projected a 27 percent drop in EV registrations without the tax credit. Germany experienced a similar sales collapse after ending its EV subsidies in 2023, offering a preview of what American automakers now face.

GM’s $1.6 Billion EV Pullback Charge

During its third-quarter earnings report in October 2025, GM disclosed a $1.6 billion special charge related to its electric vehicle pullback. The charge included $1.2 billion from EV capacity adjustments and costs associated with discontinuing next-generation hydrogen fuel cell development.

The company also confirmed it was ending production of the BrightDrop electric commercial vans in Canada, citing demand that was growing “far slower than expected.” The vans, which started at $67,925 for the smaller 400 model and $69,425 for the larger 600, failed to gain traction in the commercial fleet market despite GM’s aggressive marketing.

CFO Paul Jacobson acknowledged during the earnings call that near-term EV demand had “fallen down significantly,” though Barra insisted the company remained committed to electrification as its long-term strategy.

Competitors Also Retreating From EV Production

GM isn’t alone in scaling back electric vehicle operations. The industry-wide retreat following the tax credit expiration has claimed multiple casualties.

Honda ended production of the Acura ZDX after just one model year in September 2025, citing market conditions. The electric crossover, built on GM’s Ultium platform at the Spring Hill, Tennessee plant, required incentives reaching $30,000 off MSRP to move inventory. Production of the 2026 model year was cancelled before it even began.

Nissan halted production of the Ariya for the U.S. market, with no 2026 model year planned. Nissan told Electrive it was “pausing production of the MY26 ARIYA for the U.S. market and reallocating resources to support the launch of the all-new 2026 LEAF.”

Ford Motor Company has prioritized conventional truck production over electric vehicles following a devastating supplier fire in September 2025. The automaker openly stated it would focus on profitable gas-powered F-150s and Super Duty trucks while the all-electric F-150 Lightning took a back seat. Ford’s Model E electric vehicle division lost $1.4 billion in the third quarter of 2025 alone.

Rivian laid off approximately 600 employees in October 2025, the third workforce reduction in four months for the struggling EV maker. The cuts affected customer service, marketing, and sales departments as the company prepared for its make-or-break $45,000 R2 SUV launch in 2026.

EVXL’s Take

GM’s mass layoffs reveal the uncomfortable truth hiding beneath the company’s optimistic earnings rhetoric. When Mary Barra called EVs the company’s “North Star” on October 21, she was speaking to Wall Street investors who rewarded GM with a 15 percent stock jump. Just eight days later, the company quietly informed over 3,300 workers they’d be losing their jobs or facing temporary layoffs.

This isn’t GM’s first EV retreat in 2025. Back in April, we covered the company halting BrightDrop production in Ontario, laying off 500 workers amid weak demand for the electric commercial vans. That was an early warning sign that GM’s electrification ambitions exceeded actual market demand—even with the $7,500 tax credit still in place.

The timing of these latest cuts is particularly telling. The federal EV tax credit expired on September 30, and we extensively covered how the subsidy’s elimination would reshape the industry. Multiple studies predicted exactly what’s now happening: a collapse in demand once artificial incentives disappeared. What’s striking is how quickly automakers are responding. GM isn’t waiting to see if the market stabilizes—they’re idling $2 billion battery plants barely two months after the credit expired.

Compare GM’s actions to what we reported about Ford just last week. When Ford faced a supplier crisis, the company immediately prioritized gas-powered F-150 production over the electric F-150 Lightning. Both GM and Ford are revealing their true priorities when forced to choose: profitable internal combustion engines win every time.

The broader pattern is unmistakable. Rivian just laid off 600 workers in October. Honda cancelled the Acura ZDX after one model year. Nissan axed the Ariya for 2026. Lucid has been cutting jobs since 2024. Every pure EV maker or EV-focused division is hemorrhaging money without the tax credit safety net, while traditional automakers retreat to their profitable gas vehicle operations.

GM’s $1.6 billion EV pullback charge in Q3 tells the real story. That’s not a company committed to its “North Star”—that’s a company acknowledging it massively overbuilt capacity based on artificially inflated demand. The battery plant idling is particularly damning. GM spent billions on these Ultium facilities to vertically integrate battery production, betting that controlling the supply chain would be a competitive advantage. Now those plants are going dark for six months because there simply aren’t enough EV buyers to justify the output.

The cruel irony? GM’s overall Q3 earnings were excellent. The company beat Wall Street expectations, raised guidance, and saw its stock soar. But that success came from traditional vehicles, not EVs. When Barra says EVs remain the “North Star,” she’s really saying they remain the long-term aspiration while gas trucks pay today’s bills. And today, thousands of workers are discovering that aspirations don’t keep assembly lines running.

Neal (MA-01), and the Democratic membership of the Ways & Means Committee announced the introduction of H.R. 5862, the Energy Independence and Affordability Act (EIAA). The EIAA would restore Rep. Thompson’s historic renewable energy tax incentives passed in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. In July, the President signed the Big, Ugly Bill into law eliminating these wildly successful incentives.

Watch a video of the press conference here(link is external).

“I haven’t met anyone in our community who said, ‘I wish Congress would raise my energy bills,’” said Rep. Thompson. “But that’s exactly what happened when Congressional Republicans gutted the clean energy tax incentives I created. These investments were fully paid for, they lowered costs, they created jobs, and they positioned America to lead in the global clean energy economy. We can’t afford to fall behind—not to China, and not on the fight against climate change. That’s why I’m leading the fight now to restore these critical climate provisions.""

Thompson was joined at a press conference by Ranking Member Richard E. Neal and Representatives Terri Sewell and Steven Horsford.

“Families are struggling under Trump’s economy, and Republican cuts to clean energy tax credits mean higher costs for everyone and stunting the green energy economy we’ve been working so hard to build,” said Ranking Member Richard E. Neal. “The American Energy Independence and Affordability Act means restoring the great work of our green energy leader, Tax Subcommittee Ranking Member Mike Thompson, and supercharging high-paying jobs in our communities, lowering household energy costs, and giving us a fighting chance to save our climate. I am grateful for his leadership championing this critical legislation, and urge my Republican colleagues to join us in doing right for the people.”

The American Energy Independence and Affordability Act restores key provisions from the Inflation Reduction Act to ensure America continues leading the transition to clean, affordable, and reliable energy.

What the bill does:

Restores the full clean electricity production and investment tax credits for wind, solar, and other zero-emission power sources.

Extends incentives for energy efficient homes and commercial buildings, helping families and businesses cut utility bills through modern, efficient technologies.

Reinstates clean-vehicle tax credits for consumers and businesses to accelerate America's transition to electric and zero-emission vehicles.

Supports domestic manufacturing of clean energy components and strengthens U.S. supply chains.

Extends the clean hydrogen production credit, advancing next-generation clean fuel production.

Families are already feeling the pain from high energy costs, supply-chain shocks caused by reckless tariffs, and rising utility bills. This legislation delivers real relief by restoring incentives that make homes more efficient, lower energy bills, support clean and renewable power, and expand access to affordable clean vehicles. Restoring these incentives will strengthen our energy independence, lower utility bills, boost domestic production, and create thousands of good-paying jobs here at home.

“This legislation is exactly what cash-strapped homeowners and domestic manufacturers need — and need today,” said Jackie Wong, Senior Vice President, Climate & Energy at NRDC. “The Republicans' tax bill slashed this support for clean energy so they could hand out a tax cut to the richest Americans. That means higher bills for consumers and fewer opportunities for workers. Restoring these incentives will help shore up domestic investments while keeping utility bills in check.”

“Congress made the growing energy affordability crisis worse for families, businesses, and communities this year when it passed legislation to terminate important energy- and cost-saving tax incentives,” said Alexander Ratner, Senior Federal Policy Counsel for the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE). “Representative Mike Thompson’s new bill would make life less expensive for Americans by restoring crucial tax incentives. The Energy Independence and Affordability Act would lower monthly energy bills, help build new homes with lower costs, and reduce growing strain on the electric grid.”

“The Sonoma Clean Power Authority is proud to support this urgently needed legislation, and thanks Congressman Thompson for his continued leadership in confronting the defining challenge of our time: the climate crisis,” said Geof Syphers, CEO of the Sonoma Clean Power Authority. “We urge Congress to enact this proposal without delay.”

“Sierra Club is proud to endorse Rep. Mike Thompson’s bill, the American Energy Independence and Affordability Act, which restores popular key clean energy tax credits that were eliminated under the Trump administration’s Big Ugly Bill,” said Mary Davison, Sierra Club Redwood Chapter Political Chair. “The American Energy Independence and Affordability Act will move the U.S. toward a better future by encouraging the development of clean energy, putting more EVs on the roadways, and increasing energy efficiency. It will also help to lower costs, create jobs, strengthen the American economy, and support global U.S. leadership in clean energy.”

“This bill is exactly what is needed to protect America's leadership in renewable energy,” said Chris Benz of Napa Climate NOW!, a 350 Bay Area group. “Renewable energy is now the cheapest and least polluting source of electricity, and it should be available to all Americans everywhere.”

“We applaud Congressman Mike Thompson for his leadership on the American Clean Energy Independence and Affordability Act,” said the League of Conservation Voters Vice President of Federal Policy Matthew Davis. “This is a critical step to restoring clean energy incentives that lower energy costs for families and businesses, strengthen energy security, create jobs, and boost U.S. manufacturing.

The Louisiana 100 Plan gives us the opportunity to set an ambitious goal to boost the Louisiana economy by attracting $100 billion in new industrial projects over the next 10 years. Why are we so confident we can reach this bold target? Because Louisiana has what businesses and industries need most: reliable, affordable energy.

Energy reliability is fundamental to modern business. When the power goes out, even for a short time, factories stop production, servers crash and shops close their doors.

That’s why companies like Meta and Hyundai have decided to build or expand in Louisiana: Because they know they can count on low, predictable energy costs and a utility committed to keeping the lights on. Stability that gives businesses the confidence to invest, hire and grow. With some of the lowest rates in the country.

But this plan isn’t just about energy, it’s about diversifying Louisiana’s economy. By attracting new projects and supporting existing businesses, we’re building a stronger, more balanced economy that can weather market shifts and seize new opportunities. And all of our customers benefit when the communities we serve prosper.

New industrial projects don’t just help big companies—they help the people and communities of Louisiana directly through:

Construction jobs at the start and long-term positions for operations and maintenance, while also boosting jobs in manufacturing, logistics and professional services.

Steady revenue from leases or royalties for landowners who host projects.

New customers and higher household incomes that lead to more spending at local businesses.

A larger property-tax base that gives local governments more funds for schools, roads, and public services.

Community benefit agreements that help fund programs like River Parishes Community College’s workforce training center that provides access and training needed to equip residents with the skills required to seize a new career.

The Louisiana 100 Plan is more than a short-term boost. It’s a long-term strategy to build a resilient and competitive economy that can compete globally and thrive for generations. It’s a commitment to all of our customers, to our home state. By keeping energy affordable, investing in world-class infrastructure, and partnering with local leaders, Entergy Louisiana is turning our natural advantages into lasting prosperity.

The total includes 3,400 workers that were furloughed over the summer at its Factory Zero plant in Detroit, where the electric Chevrolet Silverado, GMC Sierra and Hummer EVs are made. The company said Wednesday it will assess how much production it needs and bring back about 1,200 of those employees in January when the plant returns to work on one shift. The remaining 2,200 will be furloughed indefinitely.

In a related move, GM laid off 1,400 Ultium battery plant workers in Warren, Ohio, and 710 in Spring Hill, Tennessee. Company spokesman Kevin Kelly said 850 may come back to work in Ohio in May and 550 of the layoffs are considered indefinite. The Tennessee layoffs are temporary, he said.

Uthmeier has teamed up with Attorneys General from Texas, Georgia, Alabama and Louisiana who are raising questions about potential antitrust violations. Uthmeier and his cohorts have drafted letters saying they believe there is coordination between some companies and the environmental activists over recycling practices.

“We have reason to believe that the policies of the Consumer Goods Forum, the Green Blue Institute, and the U.S. Plastics Pact are hindering states’ economic prosperity by coordinating business behavior, which would constitute violations of Florida’s antitrust laws. We will not allow these activist organizations to push misguided policies that can’t win at the ballot box and inflate prices for Florida consumers,” Uthmeier said in a news release Wednesday.

“Radical environmental activists do not have the right, nor the avenue, to suppress business operations in our market.”

Uthmeier says the three groups he singled out are involved with efforts to regulate plastic production and packaging standards and identifying recyclable material. The state’s top law enforcement official said those efforts could amount to restraining competition that increases costs to consumers and limits choice.

Uthmeier said he and his colleagues are asking those environmental groups to explain their market activities and also request they provide supporting documents that detail their approaches. He added that if there is a coordinated effort between the groups and corporations, the activity raises serious questions about collusion and market manipulation.

“We have grave concerns that this mission is harmful to our states’ economies, results in higher costs to our states’ consumers, unreasonably restrains trade, and reduces output and quality of goods and services,” the letters state.

So far, the requests have been labeled an “inquiry” by Uthmeier, and he added that the requests for information and explanations will continue for months.

Vietnam’s industrial zones are central to its economic success, but they also account for a significant share of national emissions.

In line with its net zero by 2050 commitment and evolving international trade requirements, Vietnam – and particularly Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) – is taking steps to align its industrial growth with decarbonisation pathways.

Net zero industrial precincts (NZIPs) offer a coordinated, place-based decarbonisation approach.

They can help unlock shared infrastructure for clean energy, reduce the cost and risk of new technologies, and position HCMC as a globally competitive, net zero-aligned manufacturing hub.

By decarbonising its industrial zones through an NZIP framework, the city can future-proof its industries against trade regulations while attracting low-carbon investment and maintaining market access.

HCMC has over 17 industrial zones, each varying in size, types of industries, and energy and emissions profiles.

These differences mean each zone has differing decarbonisation opportunities – highlighting the benefits of taking a place-based approach.

In industries such as electronics and machinery, priorities include electrification, energy efficiency upgrades, fuel switching and rooftop solar deployment.

In contrast, heavy industries, such as steel and chemicals, require more complex interventions, including the use of hydrogen, ammonia, sustainable biomass and potentially carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS).

Each zone’s energy and emissions profile informs tailored interventions that reflect both the technological requirements and market pressures of its key sectors such as electronics, steel, plastics, cement and textiles.

In this report, Climateworks analyses five representative industrial zones that cover over 70 per cent of HCMC’s industrial energy use and a wide range of sectors.

These include Saigon Hi-Tech Park, Tan Thuan Export Processing Zone, and Tan Tao, Hiep Phuoc and Dong Nam Industrial Zones.

Through this analysis, we identify common decarbonisation levers that can be applied across HCMC, including renewable energy, electrification of heating and improving energy efficiency.

Financing HCMC’s industrial transition requires targeted use of blended capital, de-risking mechanisms and the alignment of Vietnam’s nascent carbon market, green bond frameworks and sustainability-linked loans.

As HCMC is set to become an international financial hub, the city is well placed to mobilise capital for industrial transition.

We recommend a phased implementation strategy beginning with pilot projects in high-readiness zones, supported by key performance indicators, emissions baselines and public–private investment coordination.

The success of these pilots will not only help reduce local emissions but also provide a national model for industrial transition that can inform future scaling across Vietnam’s industrial ecosystem.

Realising this vision requires action across four foundational pillars and one cross-cutting enabler.

Firstly, it means developing coordination and skills to embed cross-sectoral governance mechanisms and building institutional capacity.

Secondly, it is building the necessary enabling infrastructure, including renewable electricity, green hydrogen supply, lowcarbon transport and industrial-scale heat recovery networks.

Thirdly, it means decarbonising existing industries through process upgrades, electrification, energy efficiency and low-carbon procurement standards.

Lastly, it is attracting new industries through targeted investment, incentives and policy certainty.

There are also cross-cutting enablers that are critical to unlock the required capital and deliver long-term social and economic resilience, such as sustainable finance mechanisms (e.g. green bonds, sustainability-linked loans and concessional climate finance) and workforce reskilling.

By combining our analysis of HCMC’s industrial zones with international case studies of industrial transition, this report presents a roadmap for implementing NZIPs in HCMC. HCMC stands at a strategic crossroads.

By implementing net zero industrial precincts, the city can demonstrate climate leadership, secure long-term industrial competitiveness and catalyse Vietnam’s broader transition to a resilient, low-carbon economy",https://www.climateworkscentre.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/EGP-0925-000381-VIETNAM-NZIP-REPORT-WEB-FEATURE-IMAGE.jpg,N,,2025-10-29 20:18:31.092327

Themed, “We grow to build Canada,” FPAC’s annual policy conference featured a panel session on reclaiming Canada’s competitiveness. Moderated by Moe Kabbara, president of The Transition Accelerator, the discussion included Lennard Joe, CEO of BC First Nations Forestry Council; Shenandoah Johns, chief environment and sustainability officer at West Fraser; Gary Mar, president and CEO of the Canada West Foundation; and Lisa Raitt, co-chair of the Coalition for a Better Future and vice-chair of global investment banking at CIBC.

Shenandoah Johns told the crowd that faster, thoughtful regulatory framework is necessary for the survival and competitiveness of the forest products sector in Canada.

“The U.S. Inflation Reduction Act (2022) was implemented with speed. In Canada, here we have incentive tax credits that were introduced in 2022, and we’re still waiting for biomass. So, the opposite of speed. You see two extremes there,” she said.

Johns added that there is a need for federal and provincial governments to eliminate duplication within their regulations that generate inefficiencies within the sector and to create more certainty.

“Carbon taxes are a good example. Investors can get their heads around certainty. In Finland, they have five times the mass timber market that we do in Canada with 12 times less forested area, and they have a carbon tax,” she said.

To regain Canadian competitiveness, Lennard Joe said that the forest products sector needs to have everybody in the room with an understanding of the depth of the various relationships between all parites involved.

“Being First Nations from B.C., looking at not just the structure of governance, but really a structure of discipline. What are you coming into the room with, and what is your responsibility? Within our organizations, everyone talks about continuous growth, continuous improvement, but what does that really mean on a national stage and on a global stage? And so, get everybody into the room, find out what your job is and your responsibility, work collaboratively, make the decisions and actually create some action,” he said.

Lisa Raitt, a former long-time MP for the Conservative Party of Canada who was appointed minister for natural resources, labour and transportation throughout various stages of her political career, acknowledged that Canada’s proximity to the U.S. has been an economic opportunity. However, while there has always been competitiveness within the sector between the two countries, Canada’s forest products sector has never faced a threat like the one today from its neighbour to the south.

“It’s about something more significant in terms of wanting to actually take away the market share of Canada, and as a result, we have to look at things differently,” she said, adding that the country needs to stand united in order to weather the current economic storm. “That is going to have to be the secret sauce and making sure that as we move forward from a competitive lens. We just can’t continue in this role with the United States where they call the tune and we dance to it.”

Gary Mar noted that the longstanding Canada-U.S. relationship goes far beyond Prime Minister Mark Carney and U.S. President Donald Trump, from provincial and state governments working together to our tightly integrated supply chains, and more, but added that market diversification is needed.

“We have to double-down on our efforts with our biggest market, which will always be the United States – the geography is the biggest factor in what we do – while at the same time, we need to be able to expand marketplaces,” he said.

Trade infrastructure

Mar said one of the key areas that Canada needs to focus on to diversify its markets is improving its trade infrastructure, noting that two-thirds of Canada’s GDP comes from exports, 75 per cent of which goes to the U.S.

“If we don’t expand our capacity, then there’s a problem, because if you can’t move it, you can’t sell it, and if you can’t sell it, you’re not growing your economy,” he said. “I would look at where it wants to go, and how to get it there, and where are the bottlenecks.”

Mar noted that Canada’s major ports in Vancouver, Montreal and Prince Rupert are all ranked in the lower 15 per cent in terms of efficiency in the world by the World Bank Group; and that The Port of Montreal and Port of Vancouver both have some of the lowest rankings from the World Economic Forum.

One piece of good news that Mar shared is that the four western provinces and the three territories have all signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) related to trying to build a port corridor from Prince Rupert, B.C. to Churchill, Man. He added that the projects being reviewed by the newly formed Major Projects Office include improving trade corridors across the country.

“Now it’s harder to quantify what the value of the ROI of a trade corridor is, but it’s important to be able to move what you’ve got to where it needs to go. I think it’s critically important. So, I think the federal government is moving in the right direction, but it’s got to move at the speed of government. It cannot move at the speed of bureaucracy,” Mar said.

Johns added that she would like to see rail infrastructure be made a priority within the Major Projects Office.

“Fifty to 60 per cent of our products move by rail, given the vastness of this country and the rural communities we work in,” she said. “If the rail cars don’t show up, or if there’s labour disruptions, it really can be very crippling to our industry where we don’t necessarily have lots of storage. So, you can see mills having to take outages or curtailment within a week.”

For expanding the mass timber market, Mar said Canada needs to look at current regulations with respect to municipal building codes, government procurement, and challenges related to attracting capital to that part of the wood products sector.

“Governments need to work with industry to figure out how to do all those things at the same time. It’s not good enough to have one party working towards it without all parties working towards it,” he said.

First Nations at the table

One of the keys to Canada improving its competitiveness in the forest products sector and beyond is to ensure First Nations economic participation and reconciliation is part of these processes.

In B.C., where there are 204 recognized First Nations and 32 distinct languages, leaders formed the First Nations Leadership Council, which is comprised of the political executives of the BC Assembly of First Nations. Joe said this type of structure is the start of having everyone coming into the room and understanding what they are responsible for.

“What we’ve done in B.C. is we’ve gotten a strong enough First Nations base that has come forward and said, ‘Here’s how we govern ourselves, and here’s how we have the responsibility for the land, and here’s what we can bring into the room,’” he said. “The success of anything is the ability to attract investors, and when you attract an investor, they’re going to put in the work themselves. But you have to prove that.”

B.C. was one of the first provinces to accept into law the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples Act (DRIPA), which mandates the province to bring provincial laws into alignment with the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP); and develop and implement an action plan in consultation and cooperation with Indigenous peoples to meet the objectives of the UNDRIP.

“When you have a law, it becomes responsibility. We now have the responsibility of now getting into the room, having a seat and saying, ‘Here’s how we’re going to move forward,’” Joe said.

For working with the forest products sector in B.C., the First Nations Leadership Council created the BC First Nations Forestry Council, which allows First Nations to sit with the province and work on the transformation of forest policy and regulations.

“I think that’s what we got to do with Canada,” Joe said. “We can make that happen… everyone comes into the room with a different level of understanding and responsibility, and it takes many times being in that room through the iterative approach of coming back around to make things work.”

Wildfire regulations

Forestry companies are well equipped to be part of forest fire mitigation strategies in Canada. However, regulations and investments need to improve to allow companies to better manage the forests.

“I think that there’s a very compelling economic and climate change argument, and right now, I think our regulation does not permit that,” Johns said. “Here’s an example that industry is facing. You’ve got regulation that protects migratory birds and fish and caribou, all good things, right? But in terms of activating into the land base to reduce the fire risk and the fuel loading on the ground, it can take one or two fire seasons to pass before we’re able to do that. So, those are very pragmatic issues getting in the way of balancing those things.”

Courage to make changes

Raitt noted that the building blocks of competitiveness are decreasing expenses and expand markets, two things politicians can help industry achieve.

“Under decreasing expenses comes the regulatory reform and the courage of the politicians to follow through on that regulatory reform, and they have to be reminded that what regulations are is just risk management,” she said. “And if the regulations don’t make sense for the mission that we now have, which could be very different from the one that we’ve had for the last 100 years, well then we have to amend our risk appetite, quite frankly, and that takes a lot of courage from politicians.”

Raitt added that FPAC, forest products companies, and the communities across the country that are bound together by the forestry sector, have to raise their voices to make sure that politicians hear their concerns.

“We are at a point where a non-decision is a decision. So, not wanting to go forward with regulatory reform, well, that’s your decision, because we’re at that point,” she said.",https://www.pulpandpapercanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FPAC-conference-panel-1536x934-1.jpeg,N,,2025-10-29 19:04:59.950284

The milestone, reached as of September 30, 2025, marks a major step toward India’s vision of a clean, secure, and self-reliant energy future.

According to official data, India’s installed capacity now stands at 500.89 GW, of which 256.09 GW (over 51%) comes from non-fossil fuel sources – including renewable energy, large hydro, and nuclear – while 244.80 GW (about 49%) comes from fossil-fuel-based generation.

During the first half of FY 2025–26 (April–September 2025), India added 28 GW of non-fossil capacity, compared to just 5.1 GW of fossil-fuel capacity, highlighting the accelerating pace of clean energy deployment.

Within renewables, solar power leads with 127.33 GW, followed by wind energy at 53.12 GW, underlining India’s emergence as one of the world’s largest renewable energy markets.

On July 29, 2025, India recorded its highest-ever share of renewable energy in total power generation, with renewables meeting 51.5% of the country’s electricity demand of 203 GW.

On that day alone solar generation stood at 44.50 GW; wind generation at 29.89 GW; and hydro generation at 30.29 GW.

This marked the first time in India’s history that more than half of its daily power generation came from green sources – a milestone experts are calling a “turning point” for the country’s energy transition.

With this achievement, India has already met one of its key COP26 Panchamrit commitments – achieving 50% of installed power capacity from non-fossil fuel sources by 2030 – five years ahead of schedule.

Officials said the accomplishment underscores India’s growing leadership in the global clean energy movement, achieved while maintaining grid stability and reliability across the national power system.

Beyond environmental benefits, India’s renewable energy expansion is driving new employment opportunities in manufacturing, installation, maintenance, and innovation, benefiting both urban and rural youth.

The Ministry of Power and the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) congratulated all stakeholders – including generation companies, transmission utilities, system operators, and state agencies – for their contribution to this collective achievement.

(GM) has announced layoffs affecting roughly 5,500 employees across its electric vehicle and battery plants in the United States, as the automaker scales back production following a sharp decline in demand for battery-powered cars.

The move comes on the heels of President Donald Trump’s decision to eliminate federal tax credits that had supported EV purchases.

Factory Zero operations scaled back

The largest impact will be felt at GM’s Factory Zero facility in Detroit, where the company produces the Chevrolet Silverado EV, GMC Sierra EV, and Hummer EV models.

The plant had previously furloughed 3,400 workers over the summer as production levels were reassessed.

GM said Wednesday that about 1,200 of those employees will return in January when operations resume on a single shift, while the remaining 2,200 workers will remain on indefinite furlough.

The decision reflects GM’s continuing struggle to balance its electric vehicle ambitions with cooling market demand.

The company has repeatedly slowed or paused EV production at its Detroit facility as consumer interest wanes and costs remain high.

The reduction to a single shift is part of a broader effort to align output with revised sales projections.

Battery plant layoffs in Ohio and Tennessee

In addition to the cuts in Detroit, GM confirmed layoffs at its Ultium Cells battery manufacturing facilities, which are operated through joint ventures.

About 1,400 workers in Warren, Ohio, and 710 in Spring Hill, Tennessee, were notified of layoffs.

According to GM spokesperson Kevin Kelly, around 850 employees in Ohio may return to work in May, depending on production needs.

However, 550 of those layoffs are expected to be indefinite. In Tennessee, the 710 layoffs are classified as temporary.

These battery plant reductions underscore how closely tied GM’s EV output is to consumer demand.

The slowdown in electric vehicle adoption has led the automaker to temporarily halt or scale down production across several facilities.

EV strategy reevaluation and financial impact

GM’s latest round of layoffs marks another step in the company’s ongoing reassessment of its electric vehicle strategy.

While CEO Mary Barra had committed $35 billion toward EV and autonomous vehicle development, recent market and policy shifts have forced GM to rethink that investment.

The elimination of a federal tax credit worth up to $7,500 per EV purchase at the end of September dealt a major blow to consumer affordability, already a key challenge in the sector.

GM had lobbied to preserve the credits and sought to lower prices to sustain demand, but sales momentum had already been weakening.

In its most recent quarterly earnings, GM reported a $1.6 billion charge tied to its EV operations and warned of additional write-downs in the fourth quarter as it continues to realign production.

The company also cut more than 200 salaried positions at its Tech Center in Warren, Michigan, earlier this week, signaling further cost-control measures.",https://s.tradingview.com/static/images/illustrations/news-story.jpg,N,,2025-10-29 17:18:25.706824

In an endless sea of suits and blazers, Hart said posting on social media can help demystify what it’s like to work on Capitol Hill.
If a staffer wants to make social media content like hers while still working on the Hill, they should make sure their office’s communications team is aware, Hart said.
Her current job sometimes takes her from New York back to the Hill, where she once spotted a crop of current congressional staffers looking at her posts.
“When I wanted to work on the Hill, I had no connections; I didn’t know anyone that worked there,” she said.","After Beverly Hart decided she was going to leave her job as a congressional staffer, she posted a few lighthearted videos on TikTok about her job on Capitol Hill. Now, she has more than 29,000 followers on the app, where she posts a mix of the personal and the political.

She started gaining traction thanks to a game she and her former co-workers would play while waiting for coffee in the mornings — guessing staffers’ political parties based on their outfits or accessories. A Fjällräven backpack screams Democrat, she said, while a bowtie leans Republican.

In an endless sea of suits and blazers, Hart said posting on social media can help demystify what it’s like to work on Capitol Hill.

“There’s this conspiracy theory energy around, like, all politics is bad, everyone that works in it is evil,” she said. “So I think peeling back the curtain in any capacity is a good thing and showing there’s normal people who work in Congress who are passionate about the environment or foreign affairs or whatever issue.”

But posting has its pitfalls, too. If a staffer wants to make social media content like hers while still working on the Hill, they should make sure their office’s communications team is aware, Hart said. She also advised staff to avoid mentioning the names of their bosses.

“I feel like it could have affected my job,” said Hart, who left the House in 2022 after five years of working for Democrats. “It’s hard to get taken seriously, especially [as] a 28-year-old legislative director, so I’m already fighting an uphill battle. And as a woman, I was like, I’m just not gonna post, I’m not gonna risk it.”

As long-standing norms on the Hill collide with a younger generation of congressional staff, tension over how staffers should conduct themselves online has only grown, especially for Democrats grappling with larger questions about their party’s digital reach, how to keep up with Republican influencers who made waves in the last election, and how to meet voters and constituents where they are.

Michael Suchecki, spokesperson for the Congressional Progressive Staff Association, said in his eyes, social media for staff shouldn’t be too different from how members handle it — one account for official purposes and another for campaign or personal purposes.

“It’s still a work in progress for offices to recognize that those same distinctions should apply for staffing as well,” he said. “I think modern comms recognizes that we’re people, not just cogs in a machine. The best bosses are setting clear guidelines, empowering staff to show up as people.”

Each congressional office sets its own expectations for personal posting, and there is no official policy for all House or Senate staffers. Any blanket social media ban for staff would be “directly in violation of the very freedoms and goals that the party stands for,” he said.

One Democratic staffer, who requested anonymity to speak candidly, described a recent culture shift, pinning it on the current political climate and a less productive Congress, at least legislatively speaking.

“There’s a greater relevance for people who are communicators,” the staffer said. “Congress is becoming less effective in the role that it’s supposed to do. And so I think that there’s this secondary role that it’s amassed, and if you are a new type of staffer, then maybe you’re going to be forging fewer bipartisan connections. Maybe you’re going to be more online.”

Thinking critically about why staff may want to post online on their own accounts in the first place is important, the aide said. “Do we want to have personal accounts to have certain ideas or policy goals more accessible, to have people agree with the policies and legislation that our bosses are trying to achieve? [Or] are we trying to create personal brands so that we can run consulting firms when we leave?”

According to Hart, a broader sea change could be coming to the Hill, which is powered by recent graduates working in entry-level positions like staff assistant or legislative correspondent.

“The younger, Gen Z generation is very much like, my job is not my life. So yeah, maybe I work in Congress, but I also have other interests, and I’m a multifaceted person. I think that’s kind of a good thing, and hopefully will make more young people civically engaged,” said Hart, who now works in government affairs.

Hart still makes TikTok videos, with recent ones offering ideas for political Halloween costumes or how staffers can ride out a government shutdown. Her current job sometimes takes her from New York back to the Hill, where she once spotted a crop of current congressional staffers looking at her posts.

As her videos started taking off, Hart said she got plenty of comments asking for advice about how to find a job on the Hill or what it’s like to work in politics.

“When I wanted to work on the Hill, I had no connections; I didn’t know anyone that worked there,” she said. “And so I was literally — this is aging me — looking at blogs. I was like, “how to work in Congress,” I was on Reddit threads.”

She hopes her videos give would-be staffers a glimpse of the human side of the Capitol.

“It felt like this really hard thing to break into,” she said. “So I feel like if I can provide information, or a little bit of a leg up to somebody who might not otherwise have it … and then they get an internship, I think that’s a great thing,” Hart said.",https://rollcall.com/app/uploads/2025/10/CORONA_VIRUS_002_02262020.jpg,N,,2025-10-29 18:01:25.326770

The fight became bitter at times, pitting Louisiana Republican Sen. John Kennedy against some of his colleagues and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, who support the killings.

Kennedy sponsored a resolution under the Congressional Review Act to nix a Fish and Wildlife Service plan to save the native and critically endangered northern spotted owl in the Pacific Northwest by killing non-native barred owls. The legislation failed 25-72.

“I can’t think of a rule … that better demonstrates the arrogance, the hubris, of the federal administrative state,” Kennedy said from the Senate floor before the vote, flanked by posters of owls and the rifle-carrying cartoon character Elmer Fudd. “This regulation is stupid and we will live to regret it.”

The Congressional Review Act makes it easier for lawmakers to undo administration actions. Republicans have used it repeatedly against Biden rules.

Kennedy said Burgum called him last week urging the senator to withdraw his resolution. Kennedy refused, saying the secretary should “call somebody who cared what he thought.”

Kennedy in recent days repeatedly deployed his signature rhetorical barbs against Burgum and the Biden rule. He described the barred owl as having “very soulful eyes” and said Burgum was “mad as a mama wasp.” Kennedy also said the administration was using DEI for owls.

The Trump administration is supporting the Biden-era action under pressure from loggers, who say scrapping the owl-killing rule could affect existing land-use plans. That, they say, would then jeopardize GOP efforts to increase logging.

Other groups have been split. Some animal rights advocates have sided with Kennedy. But environmentalists have pointed to protecting the endangered spotted owl.

Robert Dewey, vice president of government relations at Defenders of Wildlife, a conservation group, celebrated the vote as a win for science. He said it “soundly rejects efforts to undermine science-based decisionmaking.”

Similar divisions were evident among senators and went well beyond party lines.

Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) said, “Killing a half-billion owls seems like a crazy thing for the government to be doing.”

But Environment and Public Works Chair Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) said, “The Trump administration agrees with the Biden administration on this — how rare is that on this strategy?

Their analysis said that EVs produce 30% higher carbon dioxide emissions than gasoline vehicles in their first two years.
“When you add a bunch of electric vehicles, nobody’s going to build new coal-fired power plants to run these things because coal is really expensive compared to renewables,” he said.
“So the grid just overall becomes much cleaner in both the terms of carbon emissions for climate change, and for air pollution.""","DETROIT — Making electric vehicles and their batteries is a dirty process that uses a lot of energy. But a new study says that EVs quickly make up for that with less overall emissions through two years of use than a gas-powered vehicle.

The study also estimated that gas-powered vehicles cause at least twice as much environmental damage over their lifetimes as EVs, and said the benefits of EVs can be expected to increase in coming decades as clean sources of power, such as solar and wind, are brought onto the grid.

The work by researchers from Northern Arizona University and Duke University, published Wednesday in the journal PLOS Climate, offers insight into a transportation sector that makes up a big part of U.S. emissions. It also comes as some EV skeptics have raised concerns about whether the environmental impact of battery production, including mining, makes it worthwhile to switch to electric.

“While there is a bigger carbon footprint in the very short term because of the manufacturing process in creating the batteries for electric vehicles, very quickly you come out ahead in CO2 emissions by year three and then for all of the rest of the vehicle lifetime, you’re far ahead and so cumulatively much lower carbon footprint,"" said Drew Shindell, an earth science professor at Duke University and study co-author.

What the researchers examined

The researchers evaluated several harmful air pollutants monitored by the Environmental Protection Agency, as well as emissions data, to compare the relative impact over time of EVs and internal combustion engines on air quality and climate change.

Their analysis said that EVs produce 30% higher carbon dioxide emissions than gasoline vehicles in their first two years. That can be attributed to the energy-intensive production and manufacturing processes involved in mining lithium for EV batteries.

They also sought to account for how the U.S. energy system might develop in coming years, assuming growth in clean energy. And they modeled four different scenarios for EV adoption, ranging from the lowest — a 31% share of vehicle sales — to the highest, 75% of sales, by 2050. (EV sales accounted for about 8% of new vehicle sales in the U.S. in 2024.)

The researchers said the average of those four models found that for each additional kilowatt hour of lithium-ion battery output, carbon dioxide emissions drop by an average of 220 kilograms (485 pounds) in 2030, and another 127 kilograms (280 pounds) in 2050.

The consistent decrease in CO2 emissions from EVs is “not only driven by the on-road vehicles, but also reduction that has been brought due to electricity production,” said lead author Pankaj Sadavarte, a postdoctoral researcher at Northern Arizona University.

Greg Keoleian, a University of Michigan professor of sustainable systems who wasn’t involved in the research, called it a “valuable study” that echoes other findings and “confirms the environmental and economic benefits” of EVs.

“Accelerating the adoption of battery electric vehicles is a key strategy for decarbonizing the transportation sector which will reduce future damages and costs of climate change,” he said.

Researchers take optimistic view of the grid's future

Shindell, the Duke researcher, said the grid will evolve to have more solar and wind power.

“When you add a bunch of electric vehicles, nobody’s going to build new coal-fired power plants to run these things because coal is really expensive compared to renewables,” he said. “So the grid just overall becomes much cleaner in both the terms of carbon emissions for climate change, and for air pollution.""

Outside experts agreed — as long as the policy landscape supports it. That hasn't been the case under President Donald Trump, who has worked to boost fossil fuels and restrain solar and wind power development.

“The great news is the rest of the world isn’t slowing down in terms of its embrace of this technology,"" said Ellen Kennedy, principal for carbon-free transportation at RMI, a clean energy nonprofit. As for the U.S., she said, ""I think it’s important to keep in mind states and local governments, there’s a lot that’s happening on those fronts.”

One thing the study didn't address was recycling or disposal of batteries at the end of their life. Kennedy said battery recycling will improve, helping to address one of the environmental impacts of their production.

A challenging time for EVs in the United States

The study comes at a notable time given the challenges that EVs face in the U.S.

EVs have seen more interest in recent years as an alternative to gas-powered cars and trucks — particularly as they become more affordable and charging infrastructure becomes more available.

But growth has slowed amid shifting federal policy toward EVs and an industry step back from ambitious EV production promises.

Former President Joe Biden set a target for 50% of all new vehicle sales in the U.S. to be electric by 2030. But Trump reversed that policy, and Congress has terminated federal tax credits for an EV purchase. The administration has also targeted vehicle pollution rules that would encourage greater uptake of EVs in the U.S., and the president has attempted to halt a nationwide EV charging buildout.

“The study is important to show how really misguided the current administration’s policies are,” Shindell said. “If we want to protect us from climate change and from the very clear and local damage from poor air quality, this is a really clear way to do it: Incentivize the switch from internal combustion engines to EVs.”

A bipartisan coalition of more than a dozen governors, led by Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt, released a sweeping package of reform priorities to improve federal permitting and regulatory processes for critical energy infrastructure projects.

The governors’ letter to congressional leaders called for reforms to make federal permitting more efficient, technology-neutral, and free of political interference. Their goal: accelerate energy projects of all types to meet growing national demand.

As co-chairs of the National Governors Association (NGA) Energy and Infrastructure Working Group, Governor Stitt and Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro emphasized the urgency of reform.

Stitt and Shapiro Call for Faster Federal Energy Action

“This isn’t a Republican or Democrat issue. Every American needs to heat their home and power their vehicle,” said Governor Stitt. “As energy demand rises with AI and new technologies, we must complete energy projects faster and more efficiently. I’m thankful for Governor Shapiro and our fellow governors for bringing innovative solutions that make American energy accessible to everyone.”

Governor Shapiro added, “In Pennsylvania, we’re doubling down on our energy legacy by taking bold steps to build new power sources. My administration has streamlined government permitting to grow our economy and deliver energy projects quickly. It’s time for the United States to do the same—to win the energy and AI race and lower costs for all Americans.”

Governors Outline Reform Priorities for Energy Infrastructure

The working group developed reform recommendations across five key categories:

Streamlining Federal Agency Reviews

Reforms to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)

Reforms to Interstate Energy Transmission

Reforms to Nuclear Energy Regulation

Reforms to the Clean Water Act

These reforms aim to create predictable, faster approval timelines for energy infrastructure while maintaining environmental safeguards.

National Coalition Unites for Energy Infrastructure Progress

The Governors Energy and Infrastructure Working Group, representing all 55 states and territories, includes:

Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt, NGA Chair and co-chair

Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, co-chair

Maryland Governor Wes Moore, NGA Vice Chair

Colorado Governor Jared Polis

Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont

Indiana Governor Mike Braun

Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry

Massachusetts Governor Maura Healey

North Dakota Governor Kelly Armstrong

Rhode Island Governor Dan McKee

Tennessee Governor Bill Lee

Utah Governor Spencer Cox

Wyoming Governor Mark Gordon

Governors Voice Support for Modernized Energy Rules

“When it comes to energy infrastructure, we must move from no and slow, to yes and now,” said Governor Wes Moore of Maryland. “Permitting reform lowers costs, modernizes the grid, and creates clean energy jobs. This bipartisan group is proving we can find commonsense solutions that keep safety intact and move progress forward.”

Governor Spencer Cox agreed, stating, “If we want to power new homes, strengthen the grid, and double our capacity, we must build like we used to. Congress should act swiftly—this would be a major win for the American people.”

Colorado Governor Jared Polis added, “Governors from both parties are united in calling for faster, smarter, and more predictable energy permitting. By cutting red tape and empowering states, we can accelerate affordable clean energy and transmission development nationwide.”

North Dakota Governor Kelly Armstrong underscored the urgency: “Investing in infrastructure means nothing if we can’t deploy it. We need a process that values efficiency, certainty, and transparency. Give states flexibility, and we’ll deliver results.”

Next Steps for Energy Permitting Reform

At the NGA’s Winter Meeting in February 2025, Governors Stitt and Shapiro announced the creation of this bipartisan task force. During Senate testimony in July, Governor Armstrong advocated specific reforms on behalf of the NGA.

Over several months, the group gathered ideas to accelerate projects and identify obstacles at both state and federal levels. While not every governor endorses each individual reform, they agree on key principles—embracing digital permitting systems, categorical exclusions, and efficient litigation reforms.

The governors also urged Congress to ensure agencies have the resources and staff necessary to execute reforms effectively and end retroactive permit cancellations that stall major projects.

INOX AP will supply 7000 normal cubic metres per hour of high-purity nitrogen and 250 nm3/hour of ultra-high-purity oxygen to the facility under a 20-year agreement. The ASU is expected to come onstream next year.

According to Siddharth Jain, Managing Director at INOX AP, this is India’s first integrated ASU for the solar cell manufacturing industry that’s capable of producing ultra-high-purity gases.

“This [will strengthen] the country’s solar manufacturing ecosystem by ensuring a reliable and sustainable supply of high-purity industrial gases,” he said.

The deal builds on an existing four-year partnership between the pair. INOX AP has already installed two nitrogen generators at its Hyderabad facility and has previously supplied electronic grade gases for Premier’s 3GW solar photovoltaic cells and for its planned 4GW solar PV cell manufacturing.

Solar cells are semiconductor devices that convert sunlight directly into electricity, forming the basic building blocks of solar panels.

“INOX AP has always been our preferred partner of choice for our gas needs in our quest to lead India’s green growth story,” said Surender Pal Singh Sluja, Chairman of Premier Energies.

In solar cell manufacturing, nitrogen is used to create inert atmospheres, displace oxygen, and purge equipment. Oxygen is used in chemical reactions for creating semiconductor layers and can be used to neutralise waste gases.

In some thin-film solar cells, oxygen is added in controlled amounts to the absorber layers to change their electrical and structural properties – a process called doping.

India’s solar cell manufacturing capacity nearly tripled in the last fiscal year to reach 25GW, with further expansion projected and needed to meet the country’s 500GW renewable energy goal by 2030.

Despite the growth, India still has an overreliance on imports for certain upstream components like polysilicon, ingots, and wafers. To address this, the Indian government has set a target to build a full domestic solar manufacturing ecosystem by 2028.

During a review meeting on renewable energy, the country’s renewable energy minister Pralhad Joshi drew attention to the apparent success of the government’s PMGSY scheme, part of which provides a 60% subsidy of the solar unit cost for systems of up to 2KW capacity.

A second scheme, PM-KUSUM, aims to add solar capacity of 34,800MW by March 2026 before its second phase begins, according to the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy.","https://www.gasworld.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=900,fit=contain,quality=75,metadata=none,format=auto,gravity=auto/https://www.gasworld.com/wp-content/files/2025/10/shutterstock_2433512981.jpg",N,,2025-10-29 16:18:37.500070

But a new study says that EVs quickly make up for that with less overall emissions through two years of use than a gas-powered vehicle.
Their analysis said that EVs produce 30% higher carbon dioxide emissions than gasoline vehicles in their first two years.
“When you add a bunch of electric vehicles, nobody’s going to build new coal-fired power plants to run these things because coal is really expensive compared to renewables,” he said.
“So the grid just overall becomes much cleaner in both the terms of carbon emissions for climate change, and for air pollution.""","DETROIT (AP) — Making electric vehicles and their batteries is a dirty process that uses a lot of energy. But a new study says that EVs quickly make up for that with less overall emissions through two years of use than a gas-powered vehicle.

The study also estimated that gas-powered vehicles cause at least twice as much environmental damage over their lifetimes as EVs, and said the benefits of EVs can be expected to increase in coming decades as clean sources of power, such as solar and wind, are brought onto the grid.

The work by researchers from Northern Arizona University and Duke University, published Wednesday in the journal PLOS Climate, offers insight into a transportation sector that makes up a big part of U.S. emissions. It also comes as some EV skeptics have raised concerns about whether the environmental impact of battery production, including mining, makes it worthwhile to switch to electric.

“While there is a bigger carbon footprint in the very short term because of the manufacturing process in creating the batteries for electric vehicles, very quickly you come out ahead in CO2 emissions by year three and then for all of the rest of the vehicle lifetime, you’re far ahead and so cumulatively much lower carbon footprint,"" said Drew Shindell, an earth science professor at Duke University and study co-author.

What the researchers examined

The researchers evaluated several harmful air pollutants monitored by the Environmental Protection Agency, as well as emissions data, to compare the relative impact over time of EVs and internal combustion engines on air quality and climate change.

Their analysis said that EVs produce 30% higher carbon dioxide emissions than gasoline vehicles in their first two years. That can be attributed to the energy-intensive production and manufacturing processes involved in mining lithium for EV batteries.

They also sought to account for how the U.S. energy system might develop in coming years, assuming growth in clean energy. And they modeled four different scenarios for EV adoption, ranging from the lowest — a 31% share of vehicle sales — to the highest, 75% of sales, by 2050. (EV sales accounted for about 8% of new vehicle sales in the U.S. in 2024.)

The researchers said the average of those four models found that for each additional kilowatt hour of lithium-ion battery output, carbon dioxide emissions drop by an average of 220 kilograms (485 pounds) in 2030, and another 127 kilograms (280 pounds) in 2050.

The consistent decrease in CO2 emissions from EVs is “not only driven by the on-road vehicles, but also reduction that has been brought due to electricity production,” said lead author Pankaj Sadavarte, a postdoctoral researcher at Northern Arizona University.

Greg Keoleian, a University of Michigan professor of sustainable systems who wasn’t involved in the research, called it a “valuable study” that echoes other findings and “confirms the environmental and economic benefits” of EVs.

“Accelerating the adoption of battery electric vehicles is a key strategy for decarbonizing the transportation sector which will reduce future damages and costs of climate change,” he said.

Researchers take optimistic view of the grid's future

Shindell, the Duke researcher, said the grid will evolve to have more solar and wind power.

“When you add a bunch of electric vehicles, nobody’s going to build new coal-fired power plants to run these things because coal is really expensive compared to renewables,” he said. “So the grid just overall becomes much cleaner in both the terms of carbon emissions for climate change, and for air pollution.""

Outside experts agreed — as long as the policy landscape supports it. That hasn't been the case under President Donald Trump, who has worked to boost fossil fuels and restrain solar and wind power development.

“The great news is the rest of the world isn’t slowing down in terms of its embrace of this technology,"" said Ellen Kennedy, principal for carbon-free transportation at RMI, a clean energy nonprofit. As for the U.S., she said, ""I think it’s important to keep in mind states and local governments, there’s a lot that’s happening on those fronts.”

One thing the study didn't address was recycling or disposal of batteries at the end of their life. Kennedy said battery recycling will improve, helping to address one of the environmental impacts of their production.

A challenging time for EVs in the United States

The study comes at a notable time given the challenges that EVs face in the U.S.

EVs have seen more interest in recent years as an alternative to gas-powered cars and trucks — particularly as they become more affordable and charging infrastructure becomes more available.

But growth has slowed amid shifting federal policy toward EVs and an industry step back from ambitious EV production promises.

Former President Joe Biden set a target for 50% of all new vehicle sales in the U.S. to be electric by 2030. But Trump reversed that policy, and Congress has terminated federal tax credits for an EV purchase. The administration has also targeted vehicle pollution rules that would encourage greater uptake of EVs in the U.S., and the president has attempted to halt a nationwide EV charging buildout.

“The study is important to show how really misguided the current administration’s policies are,” Shindell said. “If we want to protect us from climate change and from the very clear and local damage from poor air quality, this is a really clear way to do it: Incentivize the switch from internal combustion engines to EVs.”

October 29, 2025

Dear Majority Leader Thune, Minority Leader Schumer, Speaker Johnson and Minority Leader Jeffries:

An open and fully functioning government is essential to the growth of the American economy, the success of manufacturers across the country and the wellbeing of our communities. When the government is shuttered, it stifles our ability to invest in our communities and our people. And it diminishes faith in our institutions.

To ensure President Trump’s tax and regulatory agenda unleashes opportunity for the American people, the federal government should be doing everything in its power to support manufacturers’ ability to invest, create jobs and grow. That requires reopening the government without further delay, and a clean continuing resolution is the swiftest and most effective way to achieve that.

The consequences of a government shutdown extend far beyond the halls of federal office buildings. It slows down the critical safety approvals of products on which families depend, especially lifesaving health care products. Inspections of new facilities, including manufacturing facilities and power plants, grind to a halt—meaning newly completed factories sit idle and valuable sources of power cannot be added to the grid. Permitting becomes next to impossible, and housing projects, retail construction, data centers, manufacturing production lines, infrastructure projects and other job-creating investments cannot break ground.

With each passing day, the American people suffer new losses, and businesses remain stuck in neutral. It is time to move forward and allow the federal government to get back to work for Americans and their communities.

The plan recognises methane’s role in international trade and includes forward-looking measures to explore emissions linked to imported fossil fuels — a welcome step towards global accountability. It also makes progress in the waste and agriculture sectors, including commitmentsto support increased methane capture from landfill gas sites, to improve monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) systems for agricultural emissions, and on selective breeding for livestock to reduce methane emissions. Additionally, it commits to exploring a specific methane reduction target for the agriculture sector.

However, Clean Air Task Force (CATF) warns that without a strong domestic regulation for the fuel supply sector, the UK risks missing a major opportunity to cut methane emissions at home and maintain its leadership abroad.

“Today’s Methane Action Plan is a step forward and shows the UK is beginning to take methane action more seriously — particularly in recognising its role in the agriculture and waste sectors.

Real progress means giving this plan regulatory teeth — turning pledges into enforceable action that cuts waste, strengthens UK competitiveness, and slows the rate of warming in our lifetimes,” said Rebecca Tremain, UK Director at Clean Air Task Force.

Methane is a super-pollutant more than 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide over 20 years and is responsible for about half a degree of global warming today. Because it is short-lived, cutting methane is the fastest and most effective way to slow the rate of warming.

Trump is also seeking new trade agreements for rare earth minerals with other Asian countries, including Japan, Vietnam, and Thailand.","Rare earth minerals have become a major point of contention in the trade war negotiations between US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping.

In October, Jinping announced a plan to tighten the export controls on this commodity, and Trump responded by threatening to raise tariffs on Chinese imports to 100%.

Rare earth minerals comprise 17 metallic elements necessary for manufacturing state-of-the-art technology, including semiconductors, smartphones, military equipment, and electric vehicles.

“In April, China first announced export controls on rare earth metals, requiring government approval before shipments could leave the country,” Joseph Harris, fiscal policy analyst for the John Locke Foundation, told the Carolina Journal. “The move unsettled global markets, and imports to North Carolina of rare earth metals surged in May as companies worked to secure supplies before the rules took full effect.”

Through July year-to-date, North Carolina’s imports of inorganic chemicals, precious and rare earth metals, and radioactive compounds rose sharply from $364.1 million to $1.1 billion — an increase of roughly 211%, according to data from the Economic Development Partnership of North Carolina (EDPNC). Of that $1.1 billion total, $366.1 million was imported in May alone, with $119.6 million of May’s imports coming from China.

Import figures come from a broad federal trade category labeled: “Inorganic Chemicals; Precious & Rare-Earth Metals & Radioactive Compounds.” This classification encompasses not only rare earth metals but also other materials.

“For decades, the United States led the world in rare earth metal production through the Mountain Pass Rare Earth Mine in California, which supplied most of the global market from the 1960s through the 1980s,” continued Harris. “However, by the late 1990s, environmental regulations and permitting rules had driven up the cost of refining. At the same time, China lowered costs through heavy subsidies and lax environmental standards, allowing it to dominate the market ever since the mine shut down in 2002.”

China now produces more than 90% of the world’s processed rare earth metals, a dominance it achieved through substantial efforts made by the Chinese government. With such a significant market share, China’s April announcement to implement export controls raised concerns among firms that rely on rare earth metals to produce modern technologies.

Trump is also seeking new trade agreements for rare earth minerals with other Asian countries, including Japan, Vietnam, and Thailand.

“Expanding trade with allies like Japan and Vietnam is precisely the right approach — competition and cooperation are key to reducing our dependence on China,” concluded Harris. “But sweeping tariffs raise costs for Americans. If we genuinely want to secure our access to rare earth metals, we need to make it affordable to mine and refine rare earths here at home by cutting red tape and allowing the market to work.”

For now, trade tensions have cooled, with the US postponing a 100% tariff on Chinese imports, and China is expected to delay expanding the export controls on rare earth minerals.",https://www.carolinajournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/18260974566_e0a77c484c_k.jpeg,N,,2025-10-29 15:20:27.015633

The funding, offered through the DOE’s Loan Programs Office (LPO), would support Wabash Valley Resources LLC (WVR) in converting its idled West Terre Haute facility into a modern operation capable of producing about 500,000 metric tons of anhydrous ammonia annually. The ammonia would be used to make fertilizer for farms across the Midwest.

The project is expected to revitalize a former coal-community, creating hundreds of union construction jobs and dozens of permanent positions once in operation, according to DOE and company statements.

If finalized, the project would become one of the largest carbon-capture and storage (CCS) installations in the country. Wabash Valley Resources plans to use petroleum coke and other waste feedstocks to generate hydrogen and ammonia while capturing and permanently storing up to 1.65 million tons of carbon dioxide per year underground.

The DOE emphasized that the commitment remains conditional, meaning WVR must meet technical, environmental, and financial milestones before the loan can close. The agency issued a Finding of No Significant Impact earlier this year following an environmental review under the National Environmental Policy Act.

The $2.4 billion project aims to lower dependence on imported fertilizer from countries such as Canada and Russia while helping decarbonize one of the most energy-intensive industries in the U.S. agriculture sector.

Even as coal power continues its steady decline in the United States, more than a hundred plants still have no retirement plans—a gap large enough to derail national climate goals.

The new study offers a way forward, showing how targeted, data-driven approaches could help accelerate the transition.

Published in Nature Energy, the study tackles a critical question: if market forces have already driven many coal plants to close, why are so many still running?

Despite years of decline, roughly 105 gigawatts of coal capacity—representing 114 plants—are still slated to operate through 2035, even though a complete phaseout by that date is widely considered essential for meeting US net-zero emissions goals.

“Coal is complex—there’s no single right way to deal with it,” says Sidney Gathrid, the study’s lead author. “Our goal was to build tools that reflect that complexity, so different actors can take on different facets of the problem. There’s no one straightforward path, and we wanted to do research that represented that reality.”

Working with Grace C. Wu, an assistant professor in the environmental studies program and senior author on the paper, Gathrid and his team show that reaching those goals will require policymakers to move beyond age-based or one-size-fits-all approaches—and instead focus on the specific contexts that accelerate the retirement of certain coal plants.

To do that, the researchers—including Jeremy Wayland, Stuart Wayland, and Ranjit Deshmukh, an associate professor in the environmental studies program and the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management—developed a new framework combining graph theory and topological data analysis to classify the entire US coal fleet into eight distinct groups based on 68 technical, economic, environmental, and socio-political factors. They also introduced a “contextual retirement vulnerability” score that measures how susceptible each plant is to early retirement by comparing it to facilities that have already announced closures.

The framework goes a step further by identifying “retirement archetypes”—patterns that explain why plants in each group are retiring. These range from regulatory and health-based drivers to unfavorable economics or political pressure, offering a clear set of levers that can be applied to similar facilities elsewhere.

“Instead of asking only why coal plants retire, we asked how we can make retirements happen faster—and in ways that are efficient and grounded in data,” Gathrid says. “Our framework helps policymakers and advocates identify where they can have the biggest impact.”

The study began as Gathrid’s senior thesis in UCSB’s environmental studies program, supported by the campus’s Manalis Leadership Fellowship, sponsored by Howard and Lisa Wenger, and evolved into a years-long collaboration. Wu says the project’s scope and impact are rare for undergraduate research.

“This is PhD-level work,” Wu says. “It’s extremely unusual for a project that started as a senior thesis to reach this level of sophistication and impact. What’s exciting is that this framework doesn’t just describe which plants might retire—it shows how to accelerate those retirements using drivers that worked with other retired or soon-to-be retired coal plants.”

Using their model, the team grouped 198 active US coal plants into clusters such as High Health Impacts Plants, Expensive Plants, and Plants in Anti-Coal Regions, each linked to specific vulnerabilities that can be targeted with policy or advocacy. For example, plants associated with high asthma rates and poor air quality could be prioritized through public-health campaigns and environmental enforcement, while those struggling financially might respond more effectively to economic incentives or market-based mechanisms.

One striking example is Belews Creek in North Carolina—a nearly 50-year-old, 2.49-gigawatt coal plant that the study categorizes as both highly vulnerable to retirement and part of Group 0: Fuel Blend Plants. The facility can burn up to 50% natural gas, yet remains one of the nation’s top particulate polluters, ranking 26th out of 198 for fine particle emissions. Financially, it’s among the most unprofitable plants in the country, carrying roughly $46 million in debt as of 2020.

Belews Creek is also located in a state seeing rapid growth in solar development and the implementation of coal debt securitization policies designed to help utilities transition away from uneconomic fossil assets. “Given the drivers for retirements in this group,” the authors note, “advocates can leverage state and utility clean energy targets.”

There were even preliminary discussions about replacing Belews Creek with a small modular nuclear reactor, but the plant’s owner, Duke Energy, has since postponed its retirement—underscoring the financial and operational complexities that the UCSB framework aims to untangle.

“We can simplify nearly 200 plants into clear groups and pair each with evidence-based strategies,” Wu says. “That’s a powerful approach to a geographically diverse and politically fragmented challenge.”

Their analysis found that about 28% of coal plants without retirement plans are already highly vulnerable to closure—potential “quick wins” for policymakers and advocates. But it also revealed that the least vulnerable plants are spread across several groups, underscoring the need for a diverse set of strategies to address the most persistent facilities.

The implications extend beyond coal. Because the model captures the multi-dimensional forces that shape real-world decisions—economics, politics, health, and grid reliability—it could be adapted to other complex decarbonization challenges.

Wu, whose research focuses on sustainable energy transition planning, says the framework bridges mathematical and applied environmental science in a way that could transform how analysts and decision-makers approach energy policy.

“This work takes state-of-the-art mathematical tools and puts them into the practitioner’s toolbox,” she says. “It’s flexible, transparent, and reproducible—exactly what we need to make smarter, more strategic decisions about the energy transition.”

Gathrid, now a co-founder of an AI and data start-up, Krv Analytics, based in Los Angeles, says the framework’s open-source design makes it especially valuable.

“The methods we developed are meant to be used,” he says. “Whether you’re working on coal, renewables, or industrial emissions, the idea is the same—use the data you have to see where progress can happen first, and why.”",https://www.futurity.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pollution-from-smoke-stack_1600-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-29 15:20:36.568395

The study concluded that during the first two years of operation, electric vehicles produce 30% higher CO₂ emissions than gasoline vehicles when all lifecycle factors are considered.
However, after the second year of on-road use, electric vehicles begin reducing cumulative emissions compared to gasoline alternatives.
Co-author Dr. Drew Shindell summarizes: ""Internal combustion vehicles lead to about 2-3 times more damage than EVs when considering both climate and air quality.""
Lead author Dr. Pankaj Sadavarte adds: ""Our research shows that transitioning from fossil fuel vehicles to battery electric vehicles (BEVs) can significantly improve climate and air quality over time.","After two years of use, lithium-ion battery electric vehicles (BEVs) result in a reduction in cumulative carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions compared to fossil-based internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, according to a new study published this week in the open-access journal PLOS Climate by Pankaj Sadavarte of Duke University, US, and colleagues.

The transportation sector accounts for 28% of US greenhouse gas emissions in the US and growing consensus supports electric vehicle adoption to address climate and air quality challenges. However, ongoing debate surrounds whether lithium-ion batteries are truly cleaner when considering their complete manufacturing and operational lifecycle.

In the new study, researchers used the Global Change Analysis Model (GCAM) integrated assessment model to evaluate CO₂ and air pollutant emissions across four scenarios of increasing electric vehicle adoption in the United States through 2050. The analysis included emissions from fuel production, battery manufacturing, vehicle assembly, and operation for both electric and gasoline vehicles.

The study concluded that during the first two years of operation, electric vehicles produce 30% higher CO₂ emissions than gasoline vehicles when all lifecycle factors are considered. The higher initial emissions stem from energy-intensive lithium mining and battery manufacturing processes. However, after the second year of on-road use, electric vehicles begin reducing cumulative emissions compared to gasoline alternatives. Moreover, as battery output increases over time, each additional kWh of lithium-ion battery output leads to an average reduction of 220 kg of CO₂ in 2030 and 127 kg of CO₂ in 2050. Accounting for both air pollution and climate change impacts, the economic value of environmental damage from ICE vehicles over their lifetime currently ranges from 2 to 3.5 times that of BEVs.

Co-author Dr. Drew Shindell summarizes: ""Internal combustion vehicles lead to about 2-3 times more damage than EVs when considering both climate and air quality.""

The authors point out that several assumptions were made regarding the mileage of the passenger car, life of a vehicle, and average battery size of the passenger car in the US. Moreover, the study did not consider the associated emissions due to infrastructure required to meet the increasing demand for electric charging. However, they conclude that relative benefits of BEVs are expected to increase over coming decades as electricity generation becomes cleaner through reduced fossil fuel use.

Lead author Dr. Pankaj Sadavarte adds: ""Our research shows that transitioning from fossil fuel vehicles to battery electric vehicles (BEVs) can significantly improve climate and air quality over time. While BEVs initially have higher lifecycle emissions due to extraction and battery production, our analysis using the Global Change Analysis Model demonstrates that they quickly outperform internal combustion vehicles—cutting carbon dioxide emissions and reducing harmful air pollutants. As the U.S. electricity grid becomes cleaner, the economic and environmental advantages of BEVs will only grow stronger.""

Project Summary: Largest U.S. Energy and Data Complex","Updated October 29, 2025 –Fermi America has signed two major nuclear energy agreements to advance its ambitious data center campus in Amarillo, Texas. The first agreement, with South Korea’s Doosan Enerbility, follows a Memorandum of Understanding signed earlier this year and focuses on producing long-lead-time nuclear equipment, including reactor pressure vessels and steam generators. These components will support the deployment of four planned Westinghouse AP1000 nuclear reactors, forming the backbone of the campus’s long-term power supply.

The second deal, with Hyundai Engineering & Construction (E&C), covers Front-End Engineering Design (FEED) for the four reactors, laying the groundwork for a full engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contract expected in early 2026. “Doosan Enerbility and Hyundai E&C have been waiting for an American company to stop power pointing about nuclear and start building it,” said Toby Neugebauer, co-founder and CEO of Fermi America. “Their firm commitment to Fermi America positions us for action, leveraging their track record to build clean, new nuclear power at the velocity and scale the President demands and the U.S. requires.”

Project Matador: One of the World’s Largest AI and Energy Complexes

Fermi America plans Project Matador, an 11 GW hyperscale data center campus in Amarillo, Texas, next to the DOE’s Pantex plant. The Texas Tech University System partners with Fermi to develop 18 million square feet of AI-focused data centers. The campus will draw power from nuclear, natural gas, solar, and wind energy sources. Fermi, co-founded by former Energy Secretary Rick Perry, filed for an IPO on Nasdaq under the ticker FRMI. The company expects the first 1 GW online by late 2026, positioning Project Matador among the world’s largest AI-energy campuses.

In July, Fermi expanded its capacity with the acquisition of more than 600MW of natural gas generation across two deals, including nine turbines, to meet near-term demand. The company aims to deliver 1GW of AI power by 2026. While natural gas will anchor the project in its early stages, Fermi’s long-term strategy prioritizes nuclear energy as the core power supply.

Washington 27th June 2025 – Texas-based Fermi America, co-founded by former U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry, has announced plans to build the Largest U.S. Energy and Data Complex, powered by nuclear, natural gas, and solar energy. Dubbed the “Hypergrid” project, it will be developed in partnership with Texas Tech University and formally launched on July 4.

Massive Scale and Clean Power Ambition

The largest U.S. energy and data complex will be built near Amarillo, adjacent to the DOE’s Pantex plant, spanning nearly 5,800 acres. Fermi says the Hypergrid campus could eventually produce up to 11 GW of energy, enough to power over 8.2M homes. The first 1 GW is expected online by late 2026. It will also host large-scale AI data centers, strategically located near major gas pipelines and atop a vast natural gas field, joining the largest data centers being built around the world.

Nuclear Power in the Spotlight

Fermi’s announcement comes amid renewed national focus on nuclear energy. Former Secretary Perry emphasized urgency: “We’re behind—and it’s all hands on deck.” He noted that while China is currently building 22 reactors, the U.S. has none under construction. Fermi has applied for four 1-GW nuclear reactors, though the company has not confirmed specifics or revealed financing details.

Fermi America’s nuclear agreements join a growing trend of tech and energy firms reopening or expanding nuclear plants alongside renewable energy, following deals like Google’s $1.6 B Iowa nuclear project with NextEra.

Political Momentum and Regulatory Scrutiny

The Largest U.S. Energy and Data Complex project aligns with recent executive orders from former President Trump to fast-track nuclear reactor applications and restructure the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). While these moves aim to revive the sector, they’ve drawn criticism over concerns of weakening oversight.

The NRC confirmed it is reviewing Fermi’s applications, with more public details expected soon.

GM on Wednesday said its all-electric Factory Zero Detroit-Hamtramck Assembly Center, which went offline this week, will remain shut down until Nov. 24 when it will run two shifts until the holiday break. It will only operate one shift when it reopens Jan. 5 after the holidays.

About 2,000 employees will stay on at Factory Zero, spokesperson Kevin Kelly said. Cuts will be based on seniority.

The plant has repeatedly cut shifts and slowed production this year, including axing a shift each for the GMC Hummer EV and Cadillac Escalade IQ.

Ultium Cells plants in Spring Hill, Tennessee, and Warren, Ohio, will pause operations starting Jan. 5 and continuing through at least May, Kelly said.

""During the temporary pause Ultium Cells plans to make upgrades to both facilities to provide greater flexibility,"" according to a GM statement. ""Ultium Cells will continue to evaluate and adapt production plans based on evolving market needs.""

Kelly said more layoffs are coming at two other sites. GM's Pontiac Metal Center, a Metro Detroit stamping plant that supplies parts for Factory Zero, will temporarily lay off 45 workers and New York's Rochester Operations, which makes electric vehicle battery cooling lines supplied to Factory Zero, will temporarily idle 74 employees. Both actions will take effect Nov. 17.

The moves come as battery manufacturers ― including the Detroit Three ― scale back plans for EV battery production, citing tepid demand and a sharply changing regulatory environment under the Trump administration.

Ford Motor Co. has delayed production plans at major battery plants it has a stake in, while a Stellantis NV partnership isn't moving forward with major parts of its originally-planned battery factory footprint. Numerous battery projects have been scrapped, delayed or mothballed.

Automakers are in many cases rethinking their entire game plan for EVs under Trump, pivoting more to hybrids and big-engine trucks, pausing EV assembly lines, and in some instances ― including with GM ― altogether stripping EV-related production equipment out of factories.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/gmtoday.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/7/f3/7f3aec92-5170-4e5a-8275-263ade857789/69025946ba049.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-10-29 15:19:39.359420

The BYD Racco EV will go on sale around the middle of next year and will only be available in Japan.

With the Racco, BYD has its sights set on Japan's best-selling EV, the Nissan Sakura, another electric kei car.

The Japan Mobility Show this year will be the stage for a very special automotive reveal: the first kei car from a non-Japanese carmaker. That’s BYD, China’s largest automaker, which wants to enter the only segment in Japan where electric vehicle sales are somewhat moving.

Update Wed. Oct. 29: This story has been updated with photos from the show.

BYD's kei car was just unveiled Tokyo, where its name was confirmed to be the BYD Racco.

Design-wise, there’s nothing surprising or groundbreaking about it. Japanese kei car regulations impose strict limitations on vehicle size, which dictate the unusual proportions of these cars. The BYD Racco is just as tall and narrow as any other kei car you may have seen, so it's kind of a big box that rides on tiny 14-inch wheels.

The Racco has a four-door configuration with sliding rear doors, which facilitate second-row access, particularly in tight spaces where there wouldn’t be enough space to swing open a regular door. The size restrictions for kei cars are meant to make them as easy as possible to live with in urban Japan, plus manufacturers want to maximize interior room within the footprint, so they all end up looking very similar.

The grille in the front is completely closed off, but somewhere behind it is an electric motor that has to be legally restricted to 63 horsepower. No word yet on specs, but it’s expected to have a 20-kilowatt-hour battery with a claimed range of 112 miles (180 km).

It will go on sale next year with pricing likely staying close to its main rival, the Nissan Sakura EV, which is also Japan’s best-selling electric car. It went on sale in 2022, and by the end of 2024, it had sold nearly 64,000 units. That’s over 40% of all EVs sold in Japan.

The Sakura costs 2.54 million yen or just under $17,000, and a fully-specced example with all the options costs a little over $20,000. CarNewsChina and other sources speculate the BYD Racco could have similar pricing.

disasters and project failures that have hampered nuclear power for much of the last 30 years.
To its credit, the Trump administration has begun to address some of the regulatory challenges that inhibit nuclear power and the energy sector broadly.","Since President Donald Trump's return to the Oval Office, the federal government has trademarked its own version of Republican socialism by nationalizing steel production and taking equity stakes in chip manufacturers and mining projects. Now, it's getting involved in the nuclear power sector.

On Tuesday, Westinghouse Electric Company announced that it had entered ""into a strategic partnership"" with the federal government, Brookfield Asset Management, and uranium fuel supplier Cameco Corporation to build ""at least"" $80 billion worth of Westinghouse's AP1000 nuclear reactors across the country. The agreement was made ""in accordance"" with Trump's May executive order, which called for the deployment of 10 new large nuclear reactors in the U.S. by 2030, according to Westinghouse.

The details of the agreement are still a bit murky, but the federal government will underwrite at least some of these projects, while others might be financed by Japan. On Tuesday, Japan's trade ministry pledged to invest $550 billion into American projects, in exchange for lower tariff rates from the Trump administration. Included in this package was an ""artificial intelligence and a nuclear reactor construction initiative that was expected to be worth up to $100 billion and involve Mitsubishi Heavy [Industries] and Toshiba,"" reports The New York Times.

The deal might also allow the federal government to take an equity stake in America's largest nuclear power company. Bloomberg's Liam Denning writes that as long as the U.S. government follows through on its financial commitment, ""it would then get a 20% share in any dividends paid out by Westinghouse above a $17.5 billion threshold."" If these projects are up and running within the next ""three years or so"" and ""Westinghouse is deemed at that point to be worth at least $30 billion, the company may then be required to do an initial public offering with the government getting warrants that may convert into an equity stake,"" according to Denning.

Nuclear power is clean, reliable, and safe, but forcing taxpayers to bet on its future success is risky. After thriving throughout the '60s, '70s, and '80s, the industry has been plagued by P.R. disasters and project failures that have hampered nuclear power for much of the last 30 years.

Recent efforts to revive the industry have not done much to build public confidence. A failed nuclear power plant project in South Carolina, which featured two AP1000 reactors, left ratepayers on the hook for millions of dollars, although Brookfield Management is considering reviving the project, according to the Associated Press.

Vogtle 3 and 4 in Georgia, which also feature two AP1000s, became the first newly constructed nuclear power plants to power the U.S. grid in the 21st century. However, it was seven years delayed and nearly $21 billion over its initial budget.

Despite these setbacks, there is good reason to be optimistic about nuclear energy's future. Big Tech firms are scaling up investments in the technology to meet the power needs for AI, shuttered power plants are being restarted, and the public is beginning to recognize the environmental and economic benefits of the energy source.

Still, this does not mean that the federal government needs to stake its claim in the industry for the industry to thrive. In fact, the government has often been the biggest impediment to nuclear power's success. State moratoriums on the power source have hollowed out much of the industrial workforce, which is one reason why Vogtle 3 and 4's price tags were so high. Stringent and costly federal regulations have driven up the price of nuclear power, making it harder for it to succeed. To its credit, the Trump administration has begun to address some of the regulatory challenges that inhibit nuclear power and the energy sector broadly.

After years of decline, America's nuclear energy prospects look bright. The best thing the government can do now is remove regulatory barriers and allow the private sector to lead, not put taxpayers on the hook by getting more involved.",https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2025/10/10-29-25-v3-a.jpg,N,,2025-10-29 16:06:45.937626

DETROIT (AP) — Making electric vehicles and their batteries is a dirty process that uses a lot of energy. But a new study says that EVs quickly make up for that with less overall emissions through two years of use than a gas-powered vehicle.

The study also estimated that gas-powered vehicles cause at least twice as much environmental damage over their lifetimes as EVs, and said the benefits of EVs can be expected to increase in coming decades as clean sources of power, such as solar and wind, are brought onto the grid.

The work by researchers from Northern Arizona University and Duke University, published Wednesday in the journal PLOS Climate, offers insight into a transportation sector that makes up a big part of U.S. emissions. It also comes as some EV skeptics have raised concerns about whether the environmental impact of battery production, including mining, makes it worthwhile to switch to electric.

“While there is a bigger carbon footprint in the very short term because of the manufacturing process in creating the batteries for electric vehicles, very quickly you come out ahead in CO2 emissions by year three and then for all of the rest of the vehicle lifetime, you’re far ahead and so cumulatively much lower carbon footprint,” said Drew Shindell, an earth science professor at Duke University and study co-author.

What the researchers examined

The researchers evaluated several harmful air pollutants monitored by the Environmental Protection Agency, as well as emissions data, to compare the relative impact over time of EVs and internal combustion engines on air quality and climate change.

Their analysis said that EVs produce 30% higher carbon dioxide emissions than gasoline vehicles in their first two years. That can be attributed to the energy-intensive production and manufacturing processes involved in mining lithium for EV batteries.

They also sought to account for how the U.S. energy system might develop in coming years, assuming growth in clean energy. And they modeled four different scenarios for EV adoption, ranging from the lowest — a 31% share of vehicle sales — to the highest, 75% of sales, by 2050. (EV sales accounted for about 8% of new vehicle sales in the U.S. in 2024.)

The researchers said the average of those four models found that for each additional kilowatt hour of lithium-ion battery output, carbon dioxide emissions drop by an average of 485 pounds in 2030, and another 280 pounds in 2050.

The consistent decrease in CO2 emissions from EVs is “not only driven by the on-road vehicles, but also reduction that has been brought due to electricity production,” said lead author Pankaj Sadavarte, a postdoctoral researcher at Northern Arizona University.

Greg Keoleian, a University of Michigan professor of sustainable systems who wasn’t involved in the research, called it a “valuable study” that echoes other findings and “confirms the environmental and economic benefits” of EVs.

“Accelerating the adoption of battery electric vehicles is a key strategy for decarbonizing the transportation sector which will reduce future damages and costs of climate change,” he said.

Researchers take optimistic view of the grid’s future

Shindell, the Duke researcher, said the grid will evolve to have more solar and wind power.

“When you add a bunch of electric vehicles, nobody’s going to build new coal-fired power plants to run these things because coal is really expensive compared to renewables,” he said. “So the grid just overall becomes much cleaner in both the terms of carbon emissions for climate change, and for air pollution.”

Outside experts agreed — as long as the policy landscape supports it. That hasn’t been the case under President Donald Trump, who has worked to boost fossil fuels and restrain solar and wind power development.

“The great news is the rest of the world isn’t slowing down in terms of its embrace of this technology,” said Ellen Kennedy, principal for carbon-free transportation at RMI, a clean energy nonprofit. As for the U.S., she said, “I think it’s important to keep in mind states and local governments, there’s a lot that’s happening on those fronts.”

One thing the study didn’t address was recycling or disposal of batteries at the end of their life. Kennedy said battery recycling will improve, helping to address one of the environmental impacts of their production.

A challenging time for EVs in the United States

The study comes at a notable time given the challenges that EVs face in the U.S.

EVs have seen more interest in recent years as an alternative to gas-powered cars and trucks — particularly as they become more affordable and charging infrastructure becomes more available.

But growth has slowed amid shifting federal policy toward EVs and an industry step back from ambitious EV production promises.

Former President Joe Biden set a target for 50% of all new vehicle sales in the U.S. to be electric by 2030. But Trump reversed that policy, and Congress has terminated federal tax credits for an EV purchase. The administration has also targeted vehicle pollution rules that would encourage greater uptake of EVs in the U.S., and the president has attempted to halt a nationwide EV charging buildout.

“The study is important to show how really misguided the current administration’s policies are,” Shindell said. “If we want to protect us from climate change and from the very clear and local damage from poor air quality, this is a really clear way to do it: Incentivize the switch from internal combustion engines to EVs.”

The dwindling EV adoption cited by GM on Wednesday arrives shortly after a recent expiration of federal tax credits.","General Motors is laying off about 1,700 workers across manufacturing sites in Michigan and Ohio, as the auto giant adjusts to slowing demand for electric vehicles.

The Detroit News first reported the cuts on Wednesday — covering about 1,200 jobs at an all-electric plant in the Detroit area and 550 workers at Ultium Cells battery cell plant in Ohio, in addition to hundreds of other employees slated for temporary layoffs. GM later confirmed the news to The Associated Press.

""In response to slower near-term EV adoption and an evolving regulatory environment, General Motors is realigning EV capacity,"" the company said in a statement, while maintaining it ""remains committed to our U.S. manufacturing footprint.""

GM added that Ultium Cells is also ""adjusting production in response to recent changes in customer plant demand."" The company said that battery cell production in Warren, Ohio, and a facility in Spring Hill, Tennessee, would be paused beginning January 2026.

Per The Detroit News, 850 workers at the Ohio plant are slated for ""temporary layoffs,"" along with another 700 employees in Tennessee.

GM says these impacted employees ""may be eligible to continue receiving a significant portion of their regular wages or salary, plus benefits."" The Michigan-based company said it will use the pause to make upgrades at both facilities, and it anticipates resuming operations by the middle of next year.

The dwindling EV adoption cited by GM on Wednesday arrives shortly after a recent expiration of federal tax credits. Before Sept. 30, new EVs came with a $7,500 federal tax credit, and up to $4,000 for used vehicles. But prospective buyers can no longer qualify. The incentive was ended as part of the massive tax and spending cut bill Congress passed in June.

Earlier in October, the automaker said it would take a $1.6 billion hit as tax incentives for EVs are slashed and emission rules ease.

GM has also downsized other parts of its workforce recently. In the last week, that's included layoffs of 200 salaried employees — mostly computer-aided design engineers in Detroit — and another 300 job cuts in Georgia, where the company is shutting an IT Innovation Center.",https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/05/01/43bf5e0b-e7a3-4892-82f3-ee6dca9d444d/thumbnail/1200x630/cb3186f0782ee6ea2ea3a5cd27103cbc/ap25113493855947.jpg,N,,2025-10-29 15:19:22.887492

While this type of advertising may not be a current priority for the federal government, recent litigation trends show that the risk of advertising in this space can also come from state or local regulators, consumers, and competitors. We take a look at recent examples from each of these areas below:

State Enforcement: Federal enforcement related to green marketing claims may be quiet as of late, but states are filling in the enforcement gap. All states have consumer protection laws in place, and California, in particular, has laws that focus on the types of “green” claims that can be made about a product. In the most recent example of state enforcement related to greenwashing, California Attorney General Rob Bonta filed suit in the Superior Court of California against Novolex Holdings, LLC, Inteplast Group Corp., and Mettler Packaging LLC (collectively, the Defendants). Under California Senate Bill 270 (SB 27), single-use plastic bags are banned from being offered at the point of sale at certain stores in California unless they meet certain criteria, including being recyclable within California and being labeled as such with instructions for recycling. According to the complaint, the Defendants’ plastic bags are not actually recyclable, despite being marketed as such. When consumers attempt to recycle them per the instructions on the bags, they “generally end up in landfills or incinerators.”1 The state accuses the Defendants of misleading consumers and violating SB 270 as well as California’s Environmental Marketing Claims Act, False Advertising Law, and Unfair Competition Law.2

Local Enforcement: In addition to state enforcement, there are also local considerations related to greenwashing. For example, in September, the city of Philadelphia sued S.C. Johnson & Son and Bimbo Bakeries USA in the Philadelphia County Court of Common Pleas for purportedly deceiving consumers about the recyclability of their LDPE (RIC #4) plastic bag products. The city alleges that the companies violated Philadelphia’s Consumer Protection Ordinance, Phila. Code § 9-6300 et seq., which was enacted in 2024 and “enable[s] the City to protect consumers from deceptive marketing such as Defendants’ claims about their bags’ recyclability.”3 While the lawsuit acknowledges that some recycling programs nationwide accept plastic bags, it also states that “for almost all of those programs, nearly all of those collected plastic bags nevertheless go to waste due to . . . the absence of any significant end market for reprocessed plastic bag material.”4 Citing the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the complaint argues that it is not whether a product can be “theoretically” recycled that matters when considering whether a recyclability claim is deceptive, but “whether recyclability marketing provides consumers with realistic expectations.”5 Based on consumer surveys, the city also alleges that consumers misunderstand any use of the chasing arrows symbol on a plastic product to mean it can be recycled, “regardless of whether those chasing arrows appear around a number as part of a RIC, alongside some qualifying language, or in any other context.”6 According to the city, because plastic bags “almost always go to waste,” “no matter how hard consumers try to recycle those plastic bags,” the companies’ recyclability claims are “confusing to the ordinary consumer, causing them to [falsely] think that they can buy Defendants’ products without contributing to plastic waste.”7

Consumer Litigation: In addition to facing government enforcement, companies making environmental claims can also face consumer class action lawsuits. Allegations of companies making false or misleading statements that cause consumers to spend more on a product than they would have had they known the truth have proliferated, especially in the “greenwashing” space. To mitigate the risk of these demands, environmental benefit claims should be carefully tailored to fit the support a company has for the claim. Broad claims are easily targeted in consumer class actions. For example, Rust-Oleum Corp. recently agreed to pay $1.5 million to settle allegations that it deceptively marketed its cleaning products as “non-toxic” and “Earth Friendly.”8 The plaintiff had filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, alleging that these claims were misleading because the cleaning products contained chemicals that could be harmful to humans, animals, and the environment. In addition to the monetary settlement, Rust-Oleum agreed to (1) remove the “non-toxic” claims from its product labeling; and (2) add an asterisk to the “Earth Friendly” claims on its products’ front labels that will direct consumers to the back label, where it will state: “Contains no inorganic phosphates, hazardous solvents, or environmentally harmful surfactants.”9

Competitor Challenges: Challenges brought by competitors can take two forms: (1) litigation, or (2) challenges filed in front of the National Advertising Division of the Better Business Bureau National Programs (NAD). In the litigation context, competitors may bring actions under the Lanham Act and state consumer protection laws. For example, personal protective equipment manufacturer Moldex-Metric, Inc. (Moldex) recently sued one of its competitors for alleged violations of the Lanham Act and California’s Unfair Competition Law and False Advertising Law. According to the complaint, the competitor falsely advertises its earplugs as “eco-friendly,” “sustainable,” and “bio-based.”10 Moldex accuses the defendant of using unqualified environmental benefit claims to “convey[] to consumers that the products have specific and far-reaching environmental benefits with little or no negative environmental impact.”11 This marketing has the purported effect of misleading consumers into believing they are making a “smarter ‘environmental’ choice” when buying these products over competitors’ products.12

As an alternative to litigation, companies or trade associations will often bring advertising challenges against their competitors in front of the NAD. In one recent decision from this spring, the International Bottled Water Association challenged several claims Boxed Water Is Better (Boxed Water) made about its boxed water products, including claims that the packaging was “100% recyclable” and “renewable,” and that Boxed Water is “better for the planet” and “sustainable.” The NAD ultimately determined that Boxed Water’s claims that its cartons are “recyclable” were supported under the FTC’s Green Guides, as Boxed Water submitted data showing that 62% of households and communities have access to recycling facilities that would accept Boxed Water’s cartons.13 The NAD also found that certain general environmental benefit claims were appropriately qualified in context by surrounding statements explaining the specific environmental benefits the carton offers.14 However, the NAD recommended that Boxed Water modify several of its other claims to provide consumers more context about the claims, and recommended that it discontinue a claim that Boxed Water was the “most renewable option in the water aisle” as Boxed Water did not submit supporting evidence for this claim.15

As reflected in the above examples, companies making environmental marketing claims have several avenues of risk to consider, including government enforcement, consumer lawsuits, and competitor challenges. Ensuring environmental claims are narrowly tailored to the claim’s support is crucial to help mitigate these various risks.

But a new study says that EVs quickly make up for that with less overall emissions through two years of use than a gas-powered vehicle.

The study also estimated that gas-powered vehicles cause at least twice as much environmental damage over their lifetimes as EVs, and said the benefits of EVs can be expected to increase in coming decades as clean sources of power, such as solar and wind, are brought onto the grid.

The work by researchers from Northern Arizona University and Duke University, published Wednesday in the journal PLOS Climate, offers insight into a transportation sector that makes up a big part of U.S. emissions. It also comes as some EV skeptics have raised concerns about whether the environmental impact of battery production, including mining, makes it worthwhile to switch to electric.

“While there is a bigger carbon footprint in the very short term because of the manufacturing process in creating the batteries for electric vehicles, very quickly you come out ahead in CO2 emissions by year three and then for all of the rest of the vehicle lifetime, you’re far ahead and so cumulatively much lower carbon footprint,"" said Drew Shindell, an earth science professor at Duke University and study co-author.

What the researchers examined

The researchers evaluated several harmful air pollutants monitored by the Environmental Protection Agency, as well as emissions data, to compare the relative impact over time of EVs and internal combustion engines on air quality and climate change.

Their analysis said that EVs produce 30% higher carbon dioxide emissions than gasoline vehicles in their first two years. That can be attributed to the energy-intensive production and manufacturing processes involved in mining lithium for EV batteries.

They also sought to account for how the U.S. energy system might develop in coming years, assuming growth in clean energy. And they modeled four different scenarios for EV adoption, ranging from the lowest — a 31% share of vehicle sales — to the highest, 75% of sales, by 2050. (EV sales accounted for about 8% of new vehicle sales in the U.S. in 2024.)

The researchers said the average of those four models found that for each additional kilowatt hour of lithium-ion battery output, carbon dioxide emissions drop by an average of 220 kilograms (485 pounds) in 2030, and another 127 kilograms (280 pounds) in 2050.

The consistent decrease in CO2 emissions from EVs is “not only driven by the on-road vehicles, but also reduction that has been brought due to electricity production,” said lead author Pankaj Sadavarte, a postdoctoral researcher at Northern Arizona University.

Greg Keoleian, a University of Michigan professor of sustainable systems who wasn’t involved in the research, called it a “valuable study” that echoes other findings and “confirms the environmental and economic benefits” of EVs.

“Accelerating the adoption of battery electric vehicles is a key strategy for decarbonizing the transportation sector which will reduce future damages and costs of climate change,” he said.

Researchers take optimistic view of the grid's future

Shindell, the Duke researcher, said the grid will evolve to have more solar and wind power.

“When you add a bunch of electric vehicles, nobody’s going to build new coal-fired power plants to run these things because coal is really expensive compared to renewables,” he said. “So the grid just overall becomes much cleaner in both the terms of carbon emissions for climate change, and for air pollution.""

Outside experts agreed — as long as the policy landscape supports it. That hasn't been the case under President Donald Trump, who has worked to boost fossil fuels and restrain solar and wind power development.

“The great news is the rest of the world isn’t slowing down in terms of its embrace of this technology,"" said Ellen Kennedy, principal for carbon-free transportation at RMI, a clean energy nonprofit. As for the U.S., she said, ""I think it’s important to keep in mind states and local governments, there’s a lot that’s happening on those fronts.”

One thing the study didn't address was recycling or disposal of batteries at the end of their life. Kennedy said battery recycling will improve, helping to address one of the environmental impacts of their production.

A challenging time for EVs in the United States

The study comes at a notable time given the challenges that EVs face in the U.S.

EVs have seen more interest in recent years as an alternative to gas-powered cars and trucks — particularly as they become more affordable and charging infrastructure becomes more available.

But growth has slowed amid shifting federal policy toward EVs and an industry step back from ambitious EV production promises.

Former President Joe Biden set a target for 50% of all new vehicle sales in the U.S. to be electric by 2030. But Trump reversed that policy, and Congress has terminated federal tax credits for an EV purchase. The administration has also targeted vehicle pollution rules that would encourage greater uptake of EVs in the U.S., and the president has attempted to halt a nationwide EV charging buildout.

“The study is important to show how really misguided the current administration’s policies are,” Shindell said. “If we want to protect us from climate change and from the very clear and local damage from poor air quality, this is a really clear way to do it: Incentivize the switch from internal combustion engines to EVs.”

DETROIT (Reuters) -General Motors said on Wednesday it will cut U.S. electric vehicle and battery production and 1,200 factory jobs at its EV plant in Detroit, as the automaker responds to a significant slowdown in demand for its battery cars.

The Detroit automaker said it will halt battery cell production at its two U.S. joint-venture battery plants - in Tennessee and Ohio - in January for about six months. It added it will temporarily lay off about 1,550 workers at the factories.

In addition, at the Ohio plant, GM said it will lay off 550 workers indefinitely. GM operates the Ohio plant jointly with South Korea's LG Energy Solution.

GM said it will cut production at its Detroit EV plant to just one shift starting in January, compared with the two shifts at present after earlier layoffs at the plant. This will cut output by about 50%, it said. The plant produces three large electric pickup trucks, including the Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra, as well as the EV Escalade IQ and Hummer SUV.

SLOWER EV ADOPTION

GM said the cuts were ""in response to slower near-term EV adoption and an evolving regulatory environment."" GM lobbied Congress and the White House to ease emissions requirements and last month also cut its EV production.

Automakers in the U.S. are backpedaling hard on their EV plans, anticipating a sharp drop in consumer demand following the expiration of a $7,500 federal tax credit for EV buyers. Some executives and analysts have said EV sales – which exceeded 10% of overall U.S. car sales over the summer – could fall by half in coming months.

Nissan, Jeep-maker Stellantis and other automakers have canceled plans for future electric models. Earlier this month, GM said it was canceling production of its electric BrightDrop van, citing slow development in the commercial EV van market.

GM has been paring its outlook for EV sales and made other EV production cuts this year.

United Auto Workers union President Shawn Fain blasted GM for the job cuts, noting the company raised expected annual profits to $13 billion this month. ""The UAW will continue to fight for more investment in both ICE and EV production at GM and beyond,"" Fain said.

In 2021, GM said it planned to transition to all EV sales by 2035 and boosted spending, but has since been retrenching.

GM CEO Mary Barra said last week ""with an evolving regulatory framework and the end of the federal consumer incentives, it's clear that near-term EV adoption will be much lower than planned.""

She added that GM expected to reduce EV losses in 2026 and beyond.

The company took a $1.6 billion charge earlier this month related to changes in its EV strategy.

GM shares were down 1% at $69.19 at midday on Wednesday. The shares have gained more than 35% so far this year.

Former President Joe Biden set a target for 50% of all new vehicle sales in the U.S. to be electric by 2030. But Trump reversed that policy, and Congress has terminated federal tax credits for an EV purchase. The administration has also targeted vehicle pollution rules that would encourage greater uptake of EVs in the U.S., and the president has attempted to halt a nationwide EV charging buildout.

“The study is important to show how really misguided the current administration’s policies are,” Shindell said. “If we want to protect us from climate change and from the very clear and local damage from poor air quality, this is a really clear way to do it: Incentivize the switch from internal combustion engines to EVs.”

Article content

The work by researchers from Northern Arizona University and Duke University, published Wednesday in the journal PLOS Climate, offers insight into a transportation sector that makes up a big part of U.S. emissions. It also comes as some EV skeptics have raised concerns about whether the environmental impact of battery production, including mining, makes it worthwhile to switch to electric.

Article content

“While there is a bigger carbon footprint in the very short term because of the manufacturing process in creating the batteries for electric vehicles, very quickly you come out ahead in CO2 emissions by year three and then for all of the rest of the vehicle lifetime, you’re far ahead and so cumulatively much lower carbon footprint,” said Drew Shindell, an earth science professor at Duke University and study co-author.

What the researchers examined

Article content

The researchers evaluated several harmful air pollutants monitored by the Environmental Protection Agency, as well as emissions data, to compare the relative impact over time of EVs and internal combustion engines on air quality and climate change.

Article content

Article content

Their analysis said that EVs produce 30% higher carbon dioxide emissions than gasoline vehicles in their first two years. That can be attributed to the energy-intensive production and manufacturing processes involved in mining lithium for EV batteries.

Article content

They also sought to account for how the U.S. energy system might develop in coming years, assuming growth in clean energy. And they modeled four different scenarios for EV adoption, ranging from the lowest — a 31% share of vehicle sales — to the highest, 75% of sales, by 2050. (EV sales accounted for about 8% of new vehicle sales in the U.S. in 2024.)

The researchers said the average of those four models found that for each additional kilowatt hour of lithium-ion battery output, carbon dioxide emissions drop by an average of 220 kilograms (485 pounds) in 2030, and another 127 kilograms (280 pounds) in 2050.",,N,,2025-10-29 15:00:21.697488

The consistent decrease in CO2 emissions from EVs is “not only driven by the on-road vehicles, but also reduction that has been brought due to electricity production,” said lead author Pankaj Sadavarte, a postdoctoral researcher at Northern Arizona University.

Greg Keoleian, a University of Michigan professor of sustainable systems who wasn’t involved in the research, called it a “valuable study” that echoes other findings and “confirms the environmental and economic benefits” of EVs.

“Accelerating the adoption of battery electric vehicles is a key strategy for decarbonizing the transportation sector which will reduce future damages and costs of climate change,” he said.

Shindell, the Duke researcher, said the grid will evolve to have more solar and wind power.

“When you add a bunch of electric vehicles, nobody’s going to build new coal-fired power plants to run these things because coal is really expensive compared to renewables,” he said. “So the grid just overall becomes much cleaner in both the terms of carbon emissions for climate change, and for air pollution.""

Outside experts agreed — as long as the policy landscape supports it. That hasn't been the case under President Donald Trump, who has worked to boost fossil fuels and restrain solar and wind power development.

“The great news is the rest of the world isn’t slowing down in terms of its embrace of this technology,"" said Ellen Kennedy, principal for carbon-free transportation at RMI, a clean energy nonprofit. As for the U.S., she said, ""I think it’s important to keep in mind states and local governments, there’s a lot that’s happening on those fronts.”

One thing the study didn't address was recycling or disposal of batteries at the end of their life. Kennedy said battery recycling will improve, helping to address one of the environmental impacts of their production.

The study comes at a notable time given the challenges that EVs face in the U.S.

EVs have seen more interest in recent years as an alternative to gas-powered cars and trucks — particularly as they become more affordable and charging infrastructure becomes more available.

But growth has slowed amid shifting federal policy toward EVs and an industry step back from ambitious EV production promises.

In fiscal 2013, the year that immediately preceded the October 2013 government shutdown, EPA faced a $472 million budget shortfall.","EPA has billions of dollars on hand to stay open through the government shutdown and is using it to fund a new approach to this funding lapse: sending some staffers home while many others stay on to support the president’s priority projects.

In recent weeks, agency staff who work in areas that the Trump administration has deprioritized — like emissions reporting and grants — have been sent home without pay until Congress and the White House iron out their differences on government spending. Others who are working to roll back regulations or approve permits for projects across the country are still coming to work and are getting paid.

This bifurcated furlough model isn’t the way EPA usually handles a lapse in appropriations. And it’s not spelled out in the agency’s shutdown contingency plan, which would have furloughed a majority of the employees who are still working, leaving them in the dark on who will continue working and for how long.

“This selective application across different parts of the agency — to try to put your thumb on the scale of what the agency could do, what it could not do — is an unusual step,” said Stan Meiburg, who held various senior leadership roles over a 39-year career at EPA. “This is very different from past experiences.”

In previous years, most EPA staffers knew which bucket they fell into. A fraction of employees would continue working because they were political appointees, their jobs were deemed vital for public safety or their positions were funded through mechanisms other than annual congressional appropriations. The rest — more than 90 percent of EPA’s workforce, on average — would receive an email from the administrator telling them there were enough leftover, or “carryover,” funds to cover their paychecks for the next week or so. Then they would be furloughed once those funds were exhausted.

But this year, most, if not all, employees received a notice upon the start of the shutdown that said they will continue working until “the Agency determines that you are no longer needed to perform exempted activities or that funds are no longer available during the shutdown,” according to copies of the notice reviewed by POLITICO’s E&E News. The notice gave no indication of when available funds would dry up.

About 10 days into October, a handful of employees received furlough notices, marking the first wave of what staffers are calling a “phased” furlough approach. Ten days later, nearly three weeks into the shutdown, a second, much larger wave hit.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said during multiple broadcast interviews it was the largest wave so far, with the agency sending furlough notices last Monday to approximately 4,000 employees — roughly a quarter of its pre-shutdown workforce.

“The way that we are able to manage our carryover funding, we are doing this in a way to make sure those employees who are working, have been working, are going to get paid,” Zeldin said during an interview with Scripps News on Friday. “Hopefully this shutdown doesn’t last forever, but as long as the carryover funding exists, then our employees will get paid.”

EPA staff don’t know when the next wave of furlough notices might come or which programs would be affected, according to several staffers who were granted anonymity because they fear retribution. And some say even their senior career supervisors don’t appear to know.

The agency “might be a couple weeks or so away from what might be that next round, which would be even larger,” Zeldin said during an interview with Fox Business last week. Zeldin did not say, and EPA’s press office did not answer follow-up questions regarding, which staffers and how many would be affected.

“At the political level they are picking and choosing who goes and who stays,” said one EPA employee.

Data from the White House’s budget office reveals EPA is sitting on a pile of “carryover” cash, raising legal and ethical concerns about its pick-and-choose approach to furloughs.

Carryover funds

Unlike some federal agencies, EPA does not solely rely on annual appropriations to cover its costs, which gives the agency some advantages in an appropriations lapse and means the agency can often delay furloughs for some time.

EPA had $44.9 billion in total budgetary resources available in fiscal 2026, according to an apportionment plan approved by the Office of Management and Budget on Sept. 30. The apportionment, “an OMB-approved plan to use budgetary resources,” according to the budget office’s website, shows the “funds provided by public law carryover” for EPA use starting Oct. 1.

It’s an abnormally high amount for an agency used to operating on an annual budget around $9 billion. EPA owes its reserves to a wave of programmatic reductions earlier in the year and to the passage in recent years of major spending laws that left it with substantial “walking around money.”

But there are limits to how the money can be spent.

EPA still has to work within the parameters set by Congress when it first authorized the funds. The agency’s budget is divided into 14 buckets, or “accounts,” since its money comes from a variety of sources, including pesticide registration fees or collected Superfund excise taxes.

A majority of EPA’s carryover funds budget — more than $30 billion — are reserved for state and tribal assistance grants.

Approximately 60 percent of EPA employees’ salaries come from the bucket called “Environmental Programs and Management,” which covers a range of activities, from IT support to regulatory reviews. OMB apportionment data shows $2.2 billion were available in total carryover funds. For comparison, EPA’s enacted EPM budget for all of last year was $3.1 billion, according to the agency’s budget request to Congress.

But the apportionment information doesn’t paint the full picture.

“Even if an overall account has a large balance, those funds still need to be traceable to a specific appropriation permitting the intended activity before they may be spent,” said David Super, a professor at Georgetown University Law Center and expert in budget and appropriations law

A more granular breakdown of how EPA plans to divvy up the available funds among programs — which would show if certain activities have more resources than others — is not publicly available.

OMB did not respond to questions about EPA’s available carryover funds.

“There is zero uncertainty at EPA about what we are working on and who is advancing these priorities,” EPA spokesperson Brigit Hirsch said in a statement. Hirsch did not acknowledge questions about the agency’s available carryover funds.

Who stays, who goes

Despite the amount of funding at its disposal, EPA is making the decision to keep full teams of staff working on some activities — and pay them — while others are sent home.

Lynn Dekleva, deputy assistant administrator in the agency’s chemicals office, said a couple of dozen staffers who work on the office’s pollution prevention programs received furlough notices, because their work doesn’t pertain to regulations or permitting.

But it’s “business as usual” for the office employees who work on new and existing chemical reviews, Dekleva told a gaggle of reporters at a U.S. Chamber of Commerce forum Wednesday. Zeldin, heeding industry complaints over delayed approval processes, has made speeding up chemical reviews one of his top priorities.

EPA staff and outside observers who engage with them say that virtually everyone who is working to undo marquee Biden-era regulations for air pollution, climate change and water quality is still on the job.

Union leaders and multiple employees said they believed no staff at the Office of General Counsel were furloughed as of Friday, while teams at EPA’s water and air offices continued to work on priority policies that the agency has promised to deliver at a breakneck pace — and, in many cases, by the end of this year. That includes EPA’s final repeals of the so-called endangerment finding for greenhouse gases, which undergirds virtually all climate rules, and its climate rules for motor vehicles.

“Folks who are working on regs and permits — or people who can reach their arms out long enough to say ‘what we’re doing is essential to that’ — they are staying on the clock,” said Miles Keogh, executive director of the National Association of Clean Air Agencies.

But other EPA divisions haven’t been as fortunate.

Office of Air and Radiation staff who work on greenhouse gas reporting and inventories and on Energy Star, a high-efficiency, product-labeling program, were sent home in a first round of furloughs two weeks ago. Those were programs EPA was working to terminate anyway, beginning with the dissolution of the offices responsible for administering them with no disclosed plans to relocate them elsewhere in the agency. EPA has also proposed ending requirements that heavy-emitting industries report their heat-trapping emissions annually, with a final rule expected by the end of the year.

Then last Monday and Tuesday grantees under several EPA programs found they could no longer reach their grant managers with auto-responses blaming the appropriations lapse.

Several staffers handling Freedom of Information Act requests have now been furloughed as well, saying they’re out of the office because of the shutdown, according to bounceback emails received by E&E News.

In addition, EPA’s Office of Inspector General will “neither update nor monitor its social media accounts” due to the spending stop, according to a post on the social media site X last Friday. The internal agency watchdog will not update its website either “until full operations resume.”

A spokesperson for the OIG declined to say whether it had opened any investigations into whether EPA had moved any funding between budget accounts to cover expenses during the lapse or whether the agency was taking appropriate steps to avoid spending money it didn’t have.

“In keeping with our long-standing policy, we do not confirm the existence of or otherwise comment about investigations,” said Kim Wheeler, a spokesperson for the office, last week.

Asked Monday how many employees have been furloughed at the EPA watchdog and if its investigations have stopped during the shutdown, Wheeler’s account sent an automatic reply saying she would be out of the office for the duration of the appropriations lapse.

Hirsch, the EPA spokesperson, said during the appropriations lapse the agency had “been intentional and aggressive in establishing a structure to ensure EPA is focused on statutory obligations and Presidential priorities, not the overreach of the previous administration.”

Shutdown plan switch-ups

EPA’s contingency plan for an appropriations lapse — updated in late September — showed that 1,734 agency staff would work through a government shutdown. They’re split about evenly between people who perform legally defined “essential” work — including Zeldin himself — and those whose positions are funded by dedicated taxes and fees.

More than 1,734 EPA staff members are still working.

Thanks to carryover funding, Zeldin said the agency has been able to avoid implementing the contingency plan in full. As “the money starts to run out,” furloughs will be sent out, he said during an interview with Newsmax over the weekend.

“When we woke up on Oct. 1, it’s not like we were at a total lapse. Total lapse of funding at EPA is an 89 percent furlough,” Zeldin continued.

EPA’s contingency blueprint says nothing about any plans for a gradual phase-down of staff, from the pre-shutdown 15,166 employees it said it had in late September to the skeleton crew of workers who will never be furloughed and who represent only a little over 10 percent of the total workforce.

The plan specifies that EPA will base furlough decisions in part on what personnel are needed to maintain progress on administration policy priorities.

“An agency may ‘exempt’ activities from the shutdown if the activities have funds available and EPA determines the activities to be priorities,” the plan states.

This creation of a two-part test for exempted employees — that they should both be funded and engaged in activities that “EPA determines” to be “priorities” — is new.

An E&E News analysis found none of the agency’s 13 most recent contingency plans available online — approved between December 2011 and March 2025 — mentioned “priorities” when defining exempted activities.

“You can have people work on your priorities, but you can’t choose who you keep and who you let go based on your substantive priorities without complying with the statute on priority for retention,” said Super, the Georgetown law professor.

Legal questions

Some former EPA officials who guided the agency through past shutdowns and appropriations lapses said they believed at the time that they were bound to apply furloughs evenly across the agency, rather than to shield staff working on priority projects.

“I don’t remember seeing in any contingency plan ever something that said our contingency plan is to basically keep working on the things that we think are most important to let everything else go,” Meiburg said.

“The only thing I can offer is the contrast to 2013,” said Joe Goffman, referring to the 17-day government shutdown that occurred early in former President Barack Obama’s second term and resulted in furloughs for nearly all EPA staff.

At the time, EPA’s air office, where Goffman served as senior counsel, was working on the first proposed rule to curb greenhouse gas emissions from the power sector.

“Nobody working on the Clean Power Plan was exempted or excepted,” said Goffman. “And that was very much a critical time, with tight presidential deadlines.” The Obama administration ultimately issued a proposed version of its flagship climate rule the following June.

But while former officials agree that the Trump EPA’s approach is unusual, there’s no consensus that it is illegal.

The Antideficiency Act places a strict prohibition on agencies spending money they don’t have and on employees working for free. But it may not stipulate how they spend money they do have.

“I think there is flexibility within the agency to manage its resources in a setting where there is not sufficient resources to operate the entire agency,” said Kevin Minoli, a partner at law firm Alston & Bird who previously served as EPA acting general counsel.

In fiscal 2013, the year that immediately preceded the October 2013 government shutdown, EPA faced a $472 million budget shortfall. It chose to compensate for that by furloughing all members of its staff without pay for 47 hours — or about six work days — Minoli said. But it also could have chosen to furlough a subset of employees for longer.

“In the past, when the agency has faced budget shortfalls, it is chosen to furlough the agency at the same time and not choose between programs,” Minoli said. “And that was an intentional choice, but it was always a choice.”

Agencies may not move money between accounts without notifying Congress, which House and Senate appropriators say EPA has not done. But appropriations laws might be written broadly enough to give the agency ample latitude to pick and choose which positions funded under its various accounts it furloughs when budgets dwindle — at least in the short term.

But the Antideficiency Act isn’t the only statute that governs how agencies spend money or make staffing decisions.

“If they’re furloughing people when there’s money to spend on their salaries, that’s not per se a violation of the Antideficiency Act. It may be an appropriations violation of some kind,” said Minoli.

Super, the Georgetown law professor, said agency priorities do not serve as “adequate grounds” to furlough employees so long as the money is available.

“If it has sufficient funds to continue to pay its full staff, at least for now, it would violate other Civil Service laws, particularly 5 U.S. Code 3502, if it chose whom to keep paying based on subjective preferences among assigned work activities,” Super said.

General Motors Co. notified about 5,500 employees across three plants that they are being laid off at least temporarily as the carmaker reassesses electric vehicle production in the wake of President Donald Trump’s move to eliminate crucial tax credits.

The total includes 3,400 workers that were furloughed over the summer at its Factory Zero plant in Detroit, where the electric Chevrolet Silverado, GMC Sierra and Hummer EVs are made. The company said Oct. 29 it will assess how much production it needs and bring back about 1,200 of those employees in January when the plant returns to work on one shift. The remaining 2,200 will be furloughed indefinitely.

In a related move, GM laid off 1,400 Ultium battery plant workers in Warren, Ohio, and 710 in Spring Hill, Tenn. Company spokesman Kevin Kelly said 850 may come back to work in Ohio in May and 550 of the layoffs are considered indefinite. The Tennessee layoffs are temporary, he said.

The cuts reflect a broader retrenchment by GM, which has moved to cut electric vehicle production amid a sharp slowdown in the market. EV sales growth had been slowing even before the Trump administration ended consumer tax credits of up to $7,500 per vehicle in September.

GM had been lobbying to keep the credits in place and have been trying to make their EVs cheaper to prop up demand. Under CEO Mary Barra, the company invested $35 billion in plug-in technology, a strategy that has been significantly downgraded recently.

GM took a $1.6 billion charge in the third quarter related to its EV investments and warned there would be more in the fourth quarter as the automaker continues to reassess how much production it will need.

BRITISH COLUMBIANS ARE WORRIED about energy use.

Across the globe, energy demand is increasing due to artificial intelligence, industrial development and data centres, and everyday people are weary of feeling it in their pockets with rising energy costs.

In B.C., we’re taking charge of our energy use now to protect our energy grid, generate economic opportunities, and to create good-paying jobs for British Columbians.

New legislation introduced last week will support actions to diversify markets and grow our economy, enable industrial projects that will create thousands of mortgage-paying jobs, and help solidify B.C. as Canada’s economic engine. We are doing everything we can to make sure that increasing energy demands are not being carried on the back of British Columbians through increased rates.

We’re looking out for local people through BC Hydro, who will be making sure that AI and data centres aren’t taking more than they need, or more than we have to give. BC Hydro will be launching an intake process for large-scale AI and data centre projects that will be capped at 150 megawatts and 50 megawatts per year. Proposals will be considered for a number of criteria, to ensure BC Hydro’s clean electricity goes to projects with the greatest benefit to British Columbians.

We know clean energy infrastructure is critical for B.C.’s future – that’s why we have 18 key projects that we’ll be fast-tracking – in part to expand our electrical grid and our clean energy economy.

The expansion of the North Coast Transmission Line, for example, will help enable more investments that have the potential to create nearly 10,000 full-time jobs, generate approximately $950-million a year in public revenues to support the services that British Columbians rely on, and contribute billions of dollars every year in GDP.

Other projects include LNG facilities, port expansions, mines, renewable energy projects like wind and solar, and natural gas projects.

We’re establishing B.C. as a global leader in clean growth, all the while keeping the impact on British Columbians day to day lives in mind. We know that global tensions, including U.S. tariffs, are causing uncertainty and impacting industry, but we are going to continue standing up for people in B.C. and facing these challenges head on.

The Detroit News first reported the cuts on Wednesday — covering about 1,200 jobs at an all-electric plant in the Detroit area and 550 workers at Ultium Cells battery cell plant in Ohio, in addition to hundreds of other employees slated for temporary layoffs. GM later confirmed the news to The Associated Press.

“In response to slower near-term EV adoption and an evolving regulatory environment, General Motors is realigning EV capacity,” the company said in a statement, while maintaining it “remains committed to our U.S. manufacturing footprint.”

GM added that Ultium Cells is also “adjusting production in response to recent changes in customer plant demand.” The company said that battery cell production in Warren, Ohio and a facility in Spring Hill, Tennessee would be paused beginning January 2026.

Per the The Detroit News, 850 workers at the Ohio plant are slated for “temporary layoffs,” along with another 700 employees in Tennessee.

GM says these impacted employees “may be eligible to continue receiving a significant portion of their regular wages or salary, plus benefits.” The Michigan-based company said it will use the pause to make upgrades at both facilities, and it anticipates resuming operations by the middle of next year.

The dwindling EV adoption cited by GM Wednesday arrives shortly after a recent expiration of federal tax credits. Before Sept. 30, new EVs came with a $7,500 federal tax credit, and up to $4,000 for used vehicles. But prospective buyers can no longer qualify. The incentive was ended as part of the massive tax and spending cut bill Congress passed in June.

The Directive represents a significant shift in EPA’s approach to residential lead cleanup, establishing nationally uniform cleanup and screening benchmarks, promoting integration of institutional controls, and introducing streamlined processes to promote consistency and expedite remediation.
Target Blood Lead Level for Remediation Goals: Preliminary Remediation Goals (PRGs) are derived from a target children’s blood lead level (BLL) of 5 micrograms per deciliter (µg/dL), underscoring EPA’s emphasis on protecting vulnerable populations.
Greater Reliance on Institutional Controls: Expect increased use of ICs such as land use restrictions and monitoring obligations, which may limit redevelopment flexibility.
The EPA’s Residential Lead Directive gives the agency’s cleanup framework a long-overdue update.","On October 16, 2025, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Office of Land and Emergency Management (OLEM) issued the Residential Lead Directive for CERCLA Sites and RCRA Hazardous Waste Cleanup Program Facilities (the “Directive”). This guidance addresses lead-contaminated soil on residential properties at sites governed by the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) hazardous waste cleanup programs.

The Directive represents a significant shift in EPA’s approach to residential lead cleanup, establishing nationally uniform cleanup and screening benchmarks, promoting integration of institutional controls, and introducing streamlined processes to promote consistency and expedite remediation. For developers, property owners, and investors, these developments carry important implications for site evaluation, due diligence protocols, and redevelopment planning.

Key Standards and Innovations

Uniform Benchmarks for Residential Soil: The Directive sets a Regional Screening Level (RSL) of 200 parts per million (ppm) and a Removal Management Level (RML) of 600 ppm, replacing prior regional-specific standards.

Target Blood Lead Level for Remediation Goals: Preliminary Remediation Goals (PRGs) are derived from a target children’s blood lead level (BLL) of 5 micrograms per deciliter (µg/dL), underscoring EPA’s emphasis on protecting vulnerable populations.

Integration of Controls: The Directive promotes combining engineering controls—such as soil excavation, replacement, or capping—with institutional measures, including deed restrictions, local ordinances, and public notifications, to ensure both short- and long-term protectiveness.

Supportive Initiatives: To facilitate implementation, EPA will establish a National Center of Excellence for Residential Lead Cleanups, develop a model institutional controls (IC) program, and issue a decision-making roadmap for CERCLA removal actions. These resources aim to enhance transparency, promote efficiency, and ensure consistent national application of remediation practices.

Implications for Developers and Investors

Expanded Scope of Property Evaluations: The 200 ppm RSL may capture a broader range of residential and mixed-use sites, particularly brownfields and infill developments. Properties exceeding 600 ppm will be prioritized for remediation, highlighting the importance of early soil sampling and risk assessments during site selection.

Enhanced Due Diligence Requirements: Standard Phase I Environmental Site Assessments (ESAs) may not adequately identify lead hazards. Developers should consider supplementing with targeted lead sampling and review of historical land uses or fill materials to mitigate potential liabilities.

Greater Reliance on Institutional Controls: Expect increased use of ICs such as land use restrictions and monitoring obligations, which may limit redevelopment flexibility. These constraints should be expressly addressed in purchase agreements, development contracts, and financing documents to ensure proper allocation of responsibilities.

Intensified Regulatory Oversight and Compliance: The Directive’s emphasis on ICs and five-year reviews signals ongoing agency engagement after remediation. The forthcoming model IC program aims to standardize documentation, monitoring, and enforcement, requiring robust compliance frameworks to manage continuing obligations.

Avenues for Strategic Engagement: The National Center of Excellence and a new decision-making roadmap create avenues for early coordination with EPA and state regulators. Proactive engagement can clarify cleanup obligations, shorten timelines, and reduce project uncertainty.

The EPA’s Residential Lead Directive gives the agency’s cleanup framework a long-overdue update.

Companies canceled or scaled back nearly $1.6 billion in clean energy projects last month, bringing the total amount of withdrawn investment to more than $24 billion so far this year, according to the clean energy advocacy group E2.

The report said $11 billion of new investments have been announced this year. “However, new investments still fall far short of offsetting the scale of cancellations and slowdowns across the clean energy manufacturing base,” it said.

E2 issues a montly report tracking large-scale clean energy project announcements. The September figure is mostly due to the shuttering of Natron Energy, a sodium-ion battery startup, reportedly due to unresolved funding issues.

Natron permanently closed its facilities Santa Clara, California, where it was headquartered, and Holland, Michigan. Before shutting down, it had announced plans for a $1.4 billion factory in Rocky Mount, North Carolina.

General Motors also downsized its electric vehicle manufacturing in September, writing in an Oct. 14 Securities and Exchange Commission filing that the company is reassessing its electric vehicle capacity and manufacturing footprint “following recent U.S. Government policy changes,” including the termination of consumer tax incentives and a “reduction in the stringency of emissions regulations.”

“[W]e expect the adoption rate of EVs to slow,” GM said.

E2 said that despite an overall downturn in clean energy projects, businesses announced $542 million in new clean energy investments in September, creating an estimated 985 new jobs.

One major announcement was Hitachi Energy’s decision to invest $457 million in a grid manufacturing facility in Virginia.

E2 found that after the Inflation Reduction Act expanded federal clean energy tax credits in 2022, companies announced “415 major projects across 42 states and Puerto Rico, representing $135B in investment and 125,000 planned jobs.”

But since the beginning of this year, 42 clean energy projects have been canceled or scaled back,indicating that “the overall trajectory of clean energy growth has sharply slowed in 2025,” the report said.

Battery storage and EV manufacturing accounted for 32 of the 42 major projects canceled this year, accounting for $19.2 billion and 18,700 jobs lost, it said.

ProPetro Holding Corp. (NYSE: PUMP), a Midland, Texas-based oilfield services provider specializing in hydraulic fracturing and complementary operations in the Permian Basin, continues to execute its strategic pivot amid a challenging 2025 commodity environment. On October 29, 2025, the company reported third-quarter revenue of $294 million—exceeding consensus estimates of $273.68 million—while adjusted EBITDA came in at $35 million, down 29% sequentially due to persistent pricing pressure and lower fleet utilization. Despite these near-term headwinds, ProPetro highlighted meaningful progress in its PROPWR segment, including a long-term 60-megawatt power supply contract with a Midwest hyperscaler data center announced just two days prior.

This earnings beat, combined with the PROPWR milestone, provides compelling evidence for an underappreciated fundamental driver: ProPetro’s aggressive electrification strategy—via its FORCE electric fracturing fleets and PROPWR power generation business—will enable the company to secure premium pricing, expand margins, and generate strong free cash flow growth through 2027. This thesis is not about macro oil price recovery, but rather ProPetro’s ability to capture structural demand for lower-emission, cost-efficient services in a maturing Permian Basin. The analysis below explores this thesis through historical analogues, quantitative valuation, competitive positioning, and balanced risk assessment.

The Core Thesis: Electrification as ProPetro’s Path to Premium Margins

ProPetro’s FORCE electric and dual-fuel fleets, combined with its PROPWR initiative, are poised to drive a growing share of total revenues from electrified services, targeting 25–30% by 2027, up from under 10% in 2024. This transition directly addresses Permian operators’ dual imperatives: reducing Scope 1 emissions to meet ESG mandates and lowering completion costs in a capital-constrained environment. Electric fleets reduce fuel expenses by 30–40% and carbon emissions by 60–70%, enabling ProPetro to command 10–15% pricing premiums while improving its own operating leverage.

The Q3 earnings and PROPWR contract serve as tangible proof points. While core fracking activity softened, the new 60MW hyperscaler deal—secured outside traditional E&P demand—demonstrates how ProPetro is monetizing its power infrastructure across industries. With the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) projecting Permian crude production to reach 6.6 million barrels per day in 2025 and sustain growth into 2026, operators will increasingly favor efficient, low-carbon providers to maximize output per spread. ProPetro’s $1 billion+ investment since 2022 in next-generation assets—including its current 4 FORCE electric fleets and plans to expand toward 20+—positions it to lead this shift, with adjusted EBITDA margins expected to expand from 12% in 2025 to 20–22% by 2027.

Historical precedent supports this outlook. During the 2010–2015 shale boom, Halliburton (HAL) expanded EBITDA margins by approximately 400–600 basis points in the Permian by securing long-term contracts for advanced horizontal drilling technologies. Similarly, Liberty Energy (LBRT) achieved 18% revenue growth in 2023—despite flat rig activity—through early adoption of electric and dual-fuel fleets. ProPetro, with its near-100% Permian focus, is following a comparable playbook but with greater basin concentration and a diversified power revenue stream.

Quantitative and Qualitative Underpinnings: Building the Case for Value Creation

ProPetro currently trades at an enterprise value to 2025 EBITDA multiple of 3.2x—a 40% discount to peers such as SLB (5.8x) and Halliburton (4.5x)—reflecting market concerns over near-term fracking demand but undervaluing its electrification momentum. A discounted cash flow (DCF) model, using conservative assumptions (10% revenue CAGR through 2027, 60% driven by PROPWR and electrified services; 12% discount rate; 5% terminal growth), yields an intrinsic value of $9.50 per share—implying 45% upside from the pre-earnings price of $6.50 (note: shares surged to ~$9.40 post-earnings on October 29). Capex is expected to moderate to $150 million annually by 2026 as fleet deployments mature, driving free cash flow conversion to 60% of EBITDA—aligned with Liberty Energy’s 55% in 2024.

Qualitatively, ProPetro’s 95%+ exposure to the Permian—projected to account for over 50% of U.S. oil production by 2026—gives it unmatched operational focus. Major operators like ExxonMobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) are accelerating electrification post their 2024 mega-mergers to meet emissions targets, creating a $10–15 billion addressable market for electric fracking services by 2030, per industry estimates. ProPetro’s agility in deploying fleets and securing non-E&P contracts (e.g., data centers) mirrors Patterson-UTI’s (PTEN) margin expansion of ~25% from tech adoption during the 2014 recovery.

Among peers, ProPetro’s fleet utilization remains strong at ~85%, compared to Liberty Energy’s 78%, and its TTM revenue of $1.37 billion reflects a lean, Permian-centric model. This focus has historically correlated with 15% higher returns on capital during basin recovery phases, according to Rystad Energy.

Risks and Counterarguments: Navigating Volatility with Precedent

Bears argue that sustained low oil prices—Citi forecasts WTI averaging $63 per barrel in 2025—will suppress drilling budgets, delay electrification ROI, and pressure ProPetro’s core fracking segment. Q3 guidance indeed implies flat activity into Q4, with EBITDA per fleet potentially declining from $20 million to $18 million. The 2015–2016 downturn saw energy-related bankruptcy filings surge over 100%, raising concerns for any leveraged OFS player.

However, ProPetro’s balance sheet is resilient: debt-to-equity stands at ~0.20, and liquidity was $158 million at quarter-end—providing ample cushion. Even at $60 WTI, free cash flow is projected to remain positive at ~$80 million in 2026. Historical recoveries favor differentiated providers: Halliburton rebounded over 300% from 2016 to 2018 as Permian output doubled, and Liberty Energy’s early electric fleet investments drove outsized gains during the 2022–2023 recovery. Execution risks—such as delays in fleet scaling or regulatory hurdles—are mitigated by ProPetro’s established partnerships with major E&P operators and its proven track record of fleet deployment.

Sector and Macro Context: ProPetro’s Niche in a Maturing Permian

Within the $250 billion global oilfield services market—growing at a 5.5% CAGR through 2029, per The Business Research Company—ProPetro operates in a high-beta, high-reward niche. The Permian’s “drill less, produce more” paradigm, driven by enhanced well productivity and infrastructure expansions like the Matterhorn Express (2.5 Bcf/d) and Enbridge’s Gray Oak pipeline (+120,000 b/d by year-end), favors efficient, low-carbon service providers.

Regulatory tailwinds further support electrification. While the GENIUS Act pertains to stablecoins, energy-specific policies—such as the Inflation Reduction Act’s 45V clean hydrogen and 45Q carbon capture tax credits—provide incentives for hybrid power and emissions-reducing technologies. During the 2010 shale boom, Permian-focused services stocks like Halliburton outperformed the S&P Energy Index by 100–200%, a pattern likely to recur as infrastructure constraints ease and efficiency becomes paramount.

Conclusion

ProPetro Holding Corp. is uniquely positioned to benefit from the structural shift toward electrification in the Permian Basin. Its FORCE fleets and PROPWR business are not speculative add-ons but core drivers of premium pricing, margin expansion, and diversified cash flow. As operators prioritize efficiency and sustainability, ProPetro’s investments position it to deliver resilient growth even in a lower-for-longer oil price environment. Investors should monitor fleet utilization above 80%, PROPWR contract momentum, and WTI stability above $60 as key indicators of thesis validation.

Given the volume of employment litigation in California, we encourage all employers to carefully review and update their policies and practices to make sure their policies and practices align with the latest legislation.

I. EMPLOYMENT CONTRACTS

AB 692: Prohibition of “Stay or Pay” Provisions in Employment Contracts

California is well known for its prohibition against noncompete agreements. AB 692 builds upon these restrictions by targeting employment contracts that contain so-called “stay or pay” provisions. A “stay or pay” provision is a contractual provision that requires a worker to pay their employer a penalty, fee, or acquired debt if they terminate their employment before completing a minimum term of employment. With very limited exceptions, AB 692 outlaws most “stay or pay” provisions in employment contracts executed on or after January 1, 2026. For a complete breakdown of AB 692 and its impacts, please see our full write up in an earlier blog post than you can access here.

II. WAGE AND HOUR

1. SB 400: Labor Code Protections for IRA “Correction” Payments

The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (“IRA”) provides various tax credits and incentives for green and clean energy projects. As this blog has previously discussed, many of the IRA’s tax credits are conditioned on employers complying with prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements derived from the federal Davis-Bacon Act. But unlike traditional Davis-Bacon Act projects, an IRA-eligible project is not required to comply with the IRA’s prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements unless the taxpayer actually claims IRA tax credits. So long as a taxpayer does not claim the tax credits in its tax return, a taxpayer is free to not require the payment of prevailing wages to workers employed on an IRA-eligible project. Consequently, when a taxpayer discovers that it or one of its contractors failed to pay the applicable “prevailing wage” to workers employed on an IRA-eligible project, the IRA regulations allow the taxpayer to either: (a) forego their right to claim the IRA tax credits or (b) preserve the right to claim the tax credits by paying penalties to the IRS and making a “correction payment” to the “underpaid” equal to the amount of the unpaid prevailing wages plus interest.

SB 400 was enacted to ensure that “correction payments” under the IRA do not automatically trigger liability for wage and hour claims under the California Labor Code on the theory that making a correction payment is, in itself, proof of unpaid wages, untimely wage payments, or inaccurate wage statements. To that end, SB 400 adds Sections 280 and 281 to the California Labor Code to state that an “elective retroactive wage payment” under the IRA does not, on its own, give rise to a cause of action under PAGA or constitute a violation of Sections 200 through 244, Sections 500 to 558.1, or Sections 1171 to 1207 of the California Labor Code.

To be clear, SB 400 does not mean that an IRA correction payment can never trigger wage and hour liability under the California Labor Code. For example, an IRA correction payment could still trigger Labor Code violations if the correction payment impacts the regular rate used to calculate overtime in a previous pay period and the employer does not make those payments necessary to cover the additional overtime owed for the prior pay periods. Additionally, if a project is also subject to prevailing wage requirements under the California Public Works Law, a correction payment could evidence a failure to timely pay prevailing wages in compliance with the California Public Works Law. But, SB 400 does ensure that an IRA correction payment will not, standing alone, give rise to claims under the Labor Code.

SB 400 was enacted as an urgency statute. Meaning it became effective immediately upon the Governor signing the bill into law on October 1, 2025.

2. SB 648: Labor Commissioner Authority to Issue Citations for Tip Theft

Section 351 of the California Labor Code protects an employee’s right to their tips and gratuities. Section 351 declares tips and gratuities to be the “sole” property of the employee to whom the patron paid, gave, or left the tips or gratuities and prevents employers from collecting, taking, or receiving any portion of that tip or gratuity. The statute also prohibits California employers from counting an employee’s tips and gratuities as a “credit” against their wages or deducting the cost of credit card processing fees from the amount of a tip or gratuity paid by credit card.

The California Labor Commissioner has long had the authority to investigate claimed violations of Section 351 and prosecute violations through a civil action. However, California law does not expressly authorize the Labor Commissioner to enforce Section 351 through the issuance of citations, as the Labor Commissioner can with respect to other wage and hour violations.

SB 648 amends Section 351 to expressly authorize the Labor Commissioner to enforce Section 351 through a civil action or through the issuance of a citation in accordance with procedures in Labor Code Section 1197.1. This becomes effective on January 1, 2026.

3. SB 809: Independent Contractors and Employee Vehicle Business Expenses

California’s “ABC” test sets the standard for most employers to determine whether a worker may be properly classified as an independent contractor. Until January 1, 2025, Labor Code Section 2781(h) exempted from the ABC test subcontractors providing construction trucking services for which a contractor’s license is not required. As that exemption expired, the Legislature enacted SB 809 to provide some construction contractors with a pathway to avoid penalties for previously misclassifying drivers as independent contractors. Accordingly, SB 809 adds Sections 2750.9, 2775.5, and 2802.2 to the California Labor Code effective January 1, 2026.

These new provisions will accomplish the following:

Section 2750.9 of California Labor Code will establish a “Construction Trucking Employer Amnesty Program” (the “Amnesty Program”). The Amnesty Program will allow eligible construction contractors to avoid civil and statutory penalties associated with the misclassification of drivers by entering into a settlement agreement with the Labor Commissioner, or an agreement with a union or a city attorney that is approved by the Labor Commissioner, before January 1, 2029. Any such settlement agreement must, among other items, require the contractor applying for relief to: (1) reclassify misclassified drivers; (2) retain the reclassified drivers as employees; (3) pay any necessary restitution and unpaid taxes for the period of misclassification; (4) secure adequate workers’ compensation coverage for the reclassified drivers; and (5) properly classify future drivers as employees when they are hired to perform duties similar to the “reclassified” positions. The Labor Commissioner will establish an application process for the Amnesty Program. The Amnesty Program will not be available for construction contractors who, at the time of their application for relief, have either: (a) a pending civil lawsuit against them alleging or involving a misclassification of a construction drivers that was filed on or before December 31, 2025, or (b) a final penalty assessed by the California Economic Development Department pursuant to Section 1128 of the Unemployment Insurance Code for failure to file returns or reports for employees.

Section 2775.5 of the California Labor Code will expressly declare that a worker’s ownership of a vehicle they use to provide labor or services does make that worker an independent contractor unless their relationship with the hiring entity fully satisfies the ABC Test. Section 2775.5 will also expressly declare that if an employee owns a vehicle that is used to provide labor or services to their employer, then the employer must reimburse the employee for the costs associated with using the vehicle in accordance with Labor Code Section 2802 and new Labor Code Section 2802.2. Importantly, SB 809 clarifies that these provisions are “declarative of existing law,” meaning that they identify existing legal obligations, not new obligations that would become effective January 1, 2026.

Section 2802.2 will make clear that an employer’s duty under Labor Code Section 2802 to reimburse employees for “necessary” work-related expenses applies to the use of a vehicle “owned by an employee and used by that employee in the discharge of their duties.” New Section 2802.2 elaborates on this obligation in the construction trucking industry by clarifying that a commercial motor vehicle driver who owns a vehicle they use in the discharge of their duties as an employee is entitled to reimbursement for “the use, upkeep, and depreciation of [the] truck, tractor, trailer, or other commercial vehicle,” regardless of whether the vehicle is owned by the driver as an individual or by the driver through a corporate entity. Reimbursement can be provided as a flat-rate reimbursement that is no less than the actual costs incurred by the employee or a per-mile reimbursement that is no less than IRS rate for the time that services were provided. As noted above, SB 809 clarifies these reimbursement obligations are “declarative of existing law”—such that they are currently in effect without delay.

4. AB 751: Extension of Rest Period Exemption at Petroleum Facilities

California law requires most employers to “authorize and permit” employees who work 3.5 hours or more in a day to take an uninterrupted rest period of at least 10 minutes for every four hours worked, or “major fraction” thereof. Ordinarily, an employee must be completely relieved of all duties and be free to leave the employer’s premises during this rest period.

In 2020, the Legislature enacted California Labor Code Section 226.75 to partially exempt employees in a “safety-sensitive position” at a “petroleum facility” from the duty-free component of the rest periods requirements. In particular, Section 226.75 states that the requirement to relieve employees of all duties during rest periods shall not apply to certain workers at petroleum facilities to the extent the employee is required to “carry and monitor a communication device … and to respond to emergencies” or “remain on employer premises to monitor the premises and respond to emergencies.” This exemption was to expire Jan. 1, 2026.

AB 751 indefinitely extends Section 226.75’s rest period exemptions. The bill also clarifies that the exemption applies to employees who hold safety-sensitive positions at a refinery that produces fuel through the processing of alternative feedstock.

5. SB 693: Extension of CBA Meal Period Exemptions to Water Corporations

SB 693 expands the categories of employees exempt from the state’s meal period requirements if they are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. Under Labor Code Section 512, most California employers must provide employees with an unpaid, uninterrupted, and duty-free meal period of at least 30 minutes in length before the start of their sixth hour of work. A second meal period must be provided before the start of the employee’s eleventh hour of work if the employee works more than ten hours in a day.

Section 512(e) exempts certain categories of employees from the meal period requirements if they work in specified industries and are covered by a valid collective bargaining agreement that expressly provides for: (a) the wages, hours of work, and working conditions of employees; (b) meal periods for covered employees; (c) final and binding arbitration of disputes concerning the meal period provisions; (d) premium wage rates for all overtime hours worked; and (e) hourly rates of pay that are at least 30 percent higher than California’s minimum wage rate. SB 693 adds employees of a “water corporation” to the categories of employees that can qualify for this exemption. The statute defines a “water corporation” as “every corporation or person owning, controlling, operating, or managing any water system for compensation within [the State of California].”

III. PAY EQUITY AND PAY DISCLOSURE

1. SB 642: The Pay Equity Enforcement Act

SB 642, unofficially labeled the “Pay Equity Enforcement Act,” amends California’s Equal Pay Act and related pay disclosure provisions of the California Labor Code.

The California Equal Pay Act, codified at California Labor Code Section 1197.5, prohibits pay discrimination on the basis of sex, race, and ethnicity. More specifically, the Act makes it unlawful to pay employees at wage rates that are less than the rates paid to employees of another sex, race, or ethnicity for “substantially similar work” unless justified by a seniority system, a merit system, a system that measures earnings by quantity or quality of production, or another “bona fide factor” other than sex, race, or ethnicity. In furtherance of these prohibitions, Section 432.3 of the California Labor Code requires, among other things, employers to disclose the pay scale for a position to an applicant upon request. If an employer has 15 or more employees, Section 432.3 also requires the employer to include a position’s pay scale in any job posting (including positions the employer posts through third parties).

SB 642 amends these laws in four significant ways.

First, SB 642 amends the definition of “pay scale” under Labor Code Section 432.3. The statute currently defines a “pay scale” as “the salary or hourly wage range that the employer reasonably expects to pay for the position.” SB 642 updates this definition to state that the “pay scale” is “a good faith estimate of the salary or hourly wage range that the employer reasonably expects to pay for the position upon hire.” Legislative committee reports relating to SB 642’s drafting indicate that this language was added to place “reasonable limits” on the range of a pay scale and to prevent employers from posting overly broad pay scales that make the pay disclosure “meaningless” to applicants. As an example of a “meaningless” job scale, the Senate Committee on Labor, Public Employment, and Retirement identified a job posting that listed an annual salary range of $65,000 to $400,000. Therefore, employers should be sure that the salary ranges they provide for job postings are narrow enough to provide applicants with a reasonable estimate of the range of salaries they actually expect to pay upon hiring an applicant.

Second, SB 642 extends and clarifies the statute of limitations for pay equity claims under the California Equal Pay Act. Existing law allows employees to file a lawsuit within two years after “the cause of action occurs.” SB 642 extends the time for bringing a lawsuit to three years after “the last date the cause of action” occurs. SB 642 also clarifies that a cause of action “occurs” when: (a) an employer adopts a compensation decision or other practice prohibited by the California Equal Pay Act; (b) when an individual becomes subject to a compensation decision or other practice prohibited by the California Equal Pay Act; or (c) when an individual is “affected” by “application” of compensation decision or other practice prohibited by the California Equal Pay Act, including each time that an employer pays wages, benefits, or other compensation resulting from unlawful decision or other practice.

Third, SB 642 amends the California Equal Pay Act to allow employees who experience pay discrimination in violation of the Act to obtain relief for “the entire period of time” the pay discrimination occurs, up to six years. This significantly increases an employer’s potential liability for pay discrimination, as wage claims ordinarily limit the look-back period to three or four years before the lawsuit commences. Given the expanded recovery period, employers must ensure they maintain pay scale, pay equity, and other wage and hour records for at least six years.

Fourth, SB 642 amends the California Equal Pay Act to add a new definition of “wages” and “wage rates.” As a result of SB 642, the California Equal Pay Act will now define “wages” and “wage rates” to mean “all forms of pay, including, but not limited to, salary, overtime pay, bonuses, stock, stock options, profit sharing and bonus plans, life insurance, vacation and holiday pay, cleaning or gasoline allowances, hotel accommodations, reimbursement for travel expenses, and benefits.” Consequently, employers should ensure pay equity across all of these various forms of “wages” and “wages rates”

SB 642’s amendments become effective on January 1, 2026.

2. SB 464: New Obligations for Annual Pay Data Reports to the CRD

In furtherance of California’s pay discrimination laws, Section 12999 of the California Government Code requires private employers with more than 100 employees to submit annual pay data report to the California Civil Rights Department. The report must include a breakdown of employees by race, ethnicity, and sex in 10 specified job categories, along with data on the number of employees by race, ethnicity, and sex within federal pay bands used by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics in its Occupational Employment Statistics survey; the median and mean hourly rate for each combination of race, ethnicity, and sex within each job category; and the total number of hours worked by each employee counted in each pay band during the reporting year.

SB 464 makes three basic changes to Section 1299. First, SB 464 requires employers to collect and store any “demographic information” they gather for the purpose of preparing and submitting the required pay data report separately from employee personnel records. Second, SB 464 increases the number of job categories for which employers must report pay data from 10 to 23 categories beginning January 1, 2027. Third, SB 464 amends Section 12999 to require courts to impose a civil penalty for a failure to file the pay data report if the civil penalty is requested by the Civil Rights Department.

IV. NOTICES AND RECORDKEEPING

1. SB 513: Preservation of Training Records as “Personnel Records”

SB 513 expands an employer’s recordkeeping obligations with respect to personnel files. Currently, Labor Code Section 1198.5 gives California employees the right to “inspect and receive” a copy of the “personnel records” their employer maintains with respect to the employee’s “performance” or to any “grievance” concerning the employee. SB 513 amends Section 1198.5 to define “personnel records relating to the employee’s performance” to include “education or training records.”

SB 513 also identifies the particular information an employer must retain with respect to “education or training records” Specifically, SB 513 requires an employee’s education or training records to include: (1) the employee’s name; (2) the name of the training provider; (3) the duration and date of the training, (4) the core competencies of a training, including skills in equipment or software, and (5) any certification or qualification resulting from the training or education.

This new recordkeeping obligation becomes effective on January 1, 2026.

2. AB 963: Recordkeeping Requirements for California Public Works Projects

AB 963 creates new recordkeeping obligations relating to projects subject to prevailing wage requirements under the California Public Works Law. AB 963 does so by adding section 1776.1 to the California Labor Code starting January 1, 2026. Under this new statute an owner or developer that enters into an agreement with a contractor on a public works project that is first “advertised for bid” or executed on or after January 1, 2026, must make a variety of new records available to the Department of Industrial Relations, multiemployer Taft-Hartley trust funds, or joint labor-management committees (“Requesting Entities”) upon their request. The records that must be kept and disclosed upon request include:

the request for bids on the project;

any lists of bids received and total bid amounts;

the final construction contracts executed between the direct contractor and either the owner or developer demonstrating compliance with the various contract requirements imposed by the Public Works Law;

the names and license numbers of the contractors and subcontractors performing the public work;

a certified copy of all payroll records for the project that owner or developer has in its possession, custody, or control; and

the monthly reports required under Section 2602 of the Public Contract Code, if the owner or developer was required to provide an enforceable commitment to use a “skilled and trained workforce” on the project.

The records must be produced within 30 days of a request from a Requesting Entity. However, the request must be made within three years of the completion of the work subject to the California Public Works Law.

The producing party may redact social security numbers and non-public pricing information or proprietary/confidential information. But, the producing party may not redact contractor or subcontractor names, the scope of work, or contractual requirements relating to prevailing wage obligations or the duty to employ a skilled and trained workforce.

Failure to comply with a request for a production of records triggers a civil penalty of $100 per day for noncompliance, escalating to $500 per day after 10 days of noncompliance.

3. SB 294: The Workplace Know Your Rights Act

SB 294, entitled the Workplace Know Your Rights Act, requires employers to provide each current employee and new hire with a standalone notice regarding various categories of workers’ rights no later than February 1, 2026. Among other provisions, the notice must contain:

a description of rights relating to worker’s compensation, immigration agency inspections, protection against unfair immigration-related practices, the right to organize and engage in “concerted activity,” and constitutional rights when interacting with law enforcement at the workplace;

a description of new legal developments pertaining to laws enforced by the California Labor & Workforce Development Agency that the Department of Industrial Relations identifies as “material and necessary”; and

a Department of Industrial Relations created list of the agencies that enforce the laws listed in the notice.

SB 294 requires the Department of Industrial Relations to create a template notice for employers to use. The notice required by SB 294 must be provided to each new employee upon hire and to each current employee on an annual basis. The notice must also go the employee’s collective bargaining representative, if any, by email or regular mail on an annual basis.

Employers must communicate the required notice to employees in “a manner the employer normally uses to communicate employment-related information.” If the Department of Industrial Relations provides a template notice in a different language that the employee “understands,” an employer must provide the notice in that other language.

In addition to requiring the annual notice of workplace rights, SB 294 requires employers, upon an employee’s request, to notify an employee’s designated emergency contact if the employee is arrested or detained at the employer’s worksite.

Violations of SB 294’s workplace notice requirements create liability in the form of a civil penalty of $500 per employee, per violation. Violations of SB 294’s requirements regarding notice of arrests to an employee’s emergency contract will give rise to a civil penalty of $500 per day of violation, up to $10,000 pe employee.

V. COLLECTIVE BARGAINING

1. AB 1340: The Transportation Network Company Drivers Labor Relations Act

In November 2020, California voters approved Proposition 22, which amended California law to classify certain app-based rideshare and delivery drivers as independent contractors under specified conditions. AB 1340, entitled the “Transportation Network Company Drivers Labor Relations Act” gives those “transportation network company drivers” the right to form, join, and participate in the activities of transportation network company driver organizations, bargain through representatives of their choosing, and engage in concerted activities for the purpose of bargaining or other mutual aid or protection. Put simply: AB 1340 gives drivers for transportation network companies (such as app-based rideshare companies) the right to engage in unionization activities starting January 1, 2026.

AB 1340 grants the California Public Employment Relations Board (“PERB”) authority to enforce the Act, oversee elections under the Act, and determine whether unfair labor practices have occurred. AB 1340 also requires transportation network companies to provide PERB with various information about their drivers sufficient for PERB to maintain a list of the “active TNC drivers” who are eligible to trigger an election and participate in unionization activities. The Act allows a “TNC driver organization” to trigger an election by providing PERB with evidence that at least 10 percent of “active TNC drivers” have authorized them to act as their bargaining representative.

2. AB 288: Extension of PERB Jurisdiction Over Private-Sector Labor Disputes

AB 288 expands the jurisdiction of the California Public Employment Relations Board (“PERB”) to allow PERB to resolve private sector issues of federal labor law—including by hearing unfair practice charges, conducting union elections, certifying bargaining representatives, and granting appropriate relief—under specified circumstances. These include situations where a worker is covered by the National Labor Relations Act (“NLRA”) but ceases to be covered by the NLRA due to legislative, executive, or judicial action repealing or narrowing the NLRA. This also includes situations where the National Labor Relations Board (“NLRB”) has engaged in actions that AB 288 deems to be the NLRB “expressly or impliedly ced[ing] jurisdiction” over the NLRA “to the states.”

As we reported in a separate blog post, the NLRB has sued to block enforcement of AB 1340 on the grounds that it is preempted by the NLRA.

VI. LEAVES OF ABSENCE AND REHIRE RIGHTS

1. SB 590: Designated Person for Paid Family Leave

SB 590 continues the ongoing trend of expanding leave rights and benefits to events affecting specified categories of family members—this time to include events impacting a “designated person.” SB 590 defines a “designated person” to include any individual related to a worker by blood or whose association with the worker is the equivalent of a family relationship.

SB 590 does this in the context of paid family leave (“PFL”) under Section 3301 of the California Unemployment Insurance Code. Section 3301 presently allows workers to obtain wage replacement benefits for up to eight weeks when they take time off for, among other purposes, caring for a seriously ill “family member.” Starting on July 1, 2028, covered workers will be able to utilize these PFL benefits when they take time off work to care for a seriously ill “designated person.”

An employee must identify their “designated person” the first time they file a claim for family temporary disability insurance benefits to care for a designated person. The employees must state under penalty of perjury how they are associated with the “designated person” person by blood or through a relationship equivalent of a family relationship.

2. AB 858: Extension of Right-to-Rehire Rights for COVID-19 Layoffs

In the aftermath of COVID-19, the California Legislature enacted Labor Code Section 2810.8 to require certain categories of employers in hospitality-related industries to offer employees who were laid off for COVID-related reasons with information about available jobs for which the laid-off employees are qualified that become available. Section 2810.8 also required employers to offer positions to those laid-off employees based on a “preference system” in accordance with timelines and procedures specified in the statute. These reinstatement preferences were slated to expire on December 31, 2025. AB 858 extends them to January 1, 2027.

VII. ENFORCEMENT OF JUDGMENTS

1. SB 261: Penalties for Unpaid Wage Judgments

SB 261 introduces significant penalties for employers that fail to timely pay judgments arising out of the nonpayment of wages. SB 261 does this by adding Sections 283.05 and 283.10 to the Labor Code starting January 1, 2026. Under these new provisions:

If a final judgment arising from nonpayment of wages for work performed in California remains unsatisfied after 180 days, a court may enforce the judgment and impose a civil penalty on the judgment debtor that is up to three times the outstanding judgment amount, plus interest and reasonable costs and attorney’s fees for the party seeking to enforce the judgment.

Any court-assessed civil penalty for failure to timely pay a qualifying judgment will be distributed so that 50% is paid to the affected employee or employees and 50% is paid to the California Division of Labor Standards Enforcement for enforcement of labor laws.

An employer may avoid these new civil penalties if it proves, by clear and convincing evidence, that good cause exists to reduce the amount of the penalty. The statute does not define “good cause.”

SB 261 becomes effective on January 1, 2026.

2. SB 355: Notice Requirement for Judgment Debtor Employers

SB 355 imposes new requirements on employers who have judgments entered against them in proceedings before the Labor Commissioner under Labor Code Section 98.2. Under SB 355, such employers must, within 60 days after a judgment is entered, inform the Labor Commissioner that: (1) the judgment is fully satisfied; (2) the bond required by subdivision Section 238(a) has been posted (if applicable); or (3) that they have entered into an agreement for the judgment to be paid in installments. Failure to comply with these notice requirements will result in a civil penalty of $2,500.

SB 355 becomes effective on January 1, 2026.

Each legislative year introduces new employment laws and amendments to existing regulations, presenting ongoing compliance challenges for employers.

The Alaska Industrial Development and Export Authority, the state’s proponent for ANWR leasing and Ambler Road, didn’t respond to requests for comment.
Interior and the Army Corps of Engineers issued the Ambler Road permits following President Donald Trump’s Oct. 6 executive order directing them to do so.
Safeguards Unclear Details supporting Interior’s decisions remain scarce, said Susan Bostrom, senior staff attorney at Trustees for Alaska, a nonprofit law firm representing environmental groups.
Siobhan McIntyre, another Trustees attorney, said the Izembek swap could be challenged because it was done without consent from Congress.","The Trump administration’s opaque decisions during the government shutdown to permit oil and gas leasing and road building in Alaska make it hard to determine how those actions address environmental harm and can be challenged in court, environmental lawyers say.

“When you call or email an agency looking for documents underlying the decision the Secretary announced, you get an out of office message,” said Erik Grafe, deputy managing attorney for Earthjustice, a nonprofit law firm that often sues to challenge federal decisions. “No one is home.”

Interior Secretary Doug Burgum on Oct. 23 announced the agency’s decision to open the coastal plain of Alaska’s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) to oil and gas leasing, issue three federal permits to build the 211-mile Ambler Road across federal lands to planned copper and critical minerals mines, and approve a land exchange for a road within a federal wilderness area in the Izembek National Wildlife Refuge.

Environmental groups have challenged each of those projects in court previously, but they say the information about how the Trump administration arrived at its final approvals of those projects is too scarce to determine next steps.

The Interior Department, which has furloughed thousands of employees during the shutdown but continues to conduct some business, responded to emailed questions for comment only with links to its decision documents. The Alaska Industrial Development and Export Authority, the state’s proponent for ANWR leasing and Ambler Road, didn’t respond to requests for comment.

The Bureau of Land Management on Oct. 23 issued a new record of decision and determination of National Environmental Policy Act adequacy on the ANWR leasing. Interior and the Army Corps of Engineers issued the Ambler Road permits following President Donald Trump’s Oct. 6 executive order directing them to do so. Interior also released a 179-page decision document on the Izembek land exchange.

“By reopening the Coastal Plain and advancing key infrastructure, we are strengthening energy independence, creating jobs and supporting Alaska’s communities while driving economic growth across the state,” Burgum said in a statement.

Safeguards Unclear

Details supporting Interior’s decisions remain scarce, said Susan Bostrom, senior staff attorney at Trustees for Alaska, a nonprofit law firm representing environmental groups.

“We still haven’t seen all the materials Interior and other agencies and the Corps have relied on to explain their decisions,” she said.

“What we’ve seen with all these decisions is little to no effort to address, let alone adopt, any measures to ensure that clean water, healthy fish and wildlife, and public lands are protected,” she said, adding that groups will continue to fight the projects “every step of the way.”

The fight over the projects extends across several administrations, so the environmental groups are likely to continue to pursue challenges once they develop a strategy.

The US District Court for the District of Alaska in 2022 granted the Biden administration’s motion for voluntary remand of the first Trump administration’s decision to permit Ambler Road, but the court maintained jurisdiction in the case. The same court ruled for environmental groups in their Izembek suit, but the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit tossed it on appeal after the Biden administration withdrew its plan for the land exchange.

The court this year ruled in favor of an Alaska state agency that challenged the Biden administration’s cancellation of ANWR oil leases issued to the agency by the first Trump administration.

Conflicts of interest between the Trump administration and a company benefiting from Ambler Road could be grounds for future legal challenges, said John Leshy, a University of California College of the Law professor who served as Interior’s solicitor in the Clinton administration.

The US said Oct. 7 that it would take a 10% stake in Canadian minerals explorer Trilogy Metals Inc., co-owner of Ambler Metals, the developer of the mines that Ambler Road would be built to access. Ambler Metals declined to comment.

The conflict “might furnish ground for legal challenges beyond the usual environmental/regulatory ones,” Leshy said in an email.

Siobhan McIntyre, another Trustees attorney, said the Izembek swap could be challenged because it was done without consent from Congress.

“An Interior secretary cannot legally trade away Izembek lands for a road through federally protected Wilderness without congressional approval,” McIntyre said.

“Throwing out the rule book for Izembek sets the stage for an array of possible land exchanges in federally protected lands across Alaska.”",https://db0ip7zd23b50.cloudfront.net/dims4/default/781ba6a/2147483647/crop/4032x1554+0+988/resize/960x370%3E/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbloomberg-bna-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F74%2F8a%2Ff6a409d4497cb93900f8a5e32f78%2Fe0743b3f-76dc-4f03-84d7-cb785b757089.jpeg,N,,2025-10-29 14:03:47.453653

As soon as the shutdown began, coal-fired power plants started producing about 15% to 20% more particle pollution.
To determine whether coal-fired power plants continued to obey the rules even when environmental inspectors were furloughed and not watching, we examined data on emissions of more than 200 coal-fired power plants across the country.
Those gases, unlike particulate matter, are continuously monitored by sensors inside coal plants’ smokestacks, even when the federal government is not operating.
That means the coal plants weren’t polluting more just because they were being asked to produce more electricity.","When the U.S. government shut down in late 2018, it furloughed nearly 600 Environmental Protection Agency pollution inspectors for more than a month. Those workers had to stop their work of monitoring and inspecting industrial sites for pollution, and stopped enforcing environmental-protection laws, including the Clean Air Act.

My colleagues and I analyzed six years’ worth of air quality levels, emissions measurements, power production data and weather reports for more than 200 coal-fired power plants around the country. We found that the coal plants’ operators appeared to take advantage of the lapse in enforcement of environmental regulations.

As soon as the shutdown began, coal-fired power plants started producing about 15% to 20% more particle pollution. And as soon as the government reopened and inspections resumed, pollution levels dropped.

Particulate matter is dangerous

The longest federal government shutdown in U.S. history up until that time began on Dec. 22, 2018, and lasted until Jan. 25, 2019. During that period, about 95% of EPA employees were furloughed, including nearly all the agency’s pollution inspectors, who keep track of whether industrial sites like coal-fired power plants follow rules meant to limit air pollution.

Among those rules are strict limits on a type of pollution called particulate matter, which is sometimes called PM2.5 and PM10. These microscopic particles are smaller than the width of a human hair. When inhaled, they can travel deep into the lungs and even get into the bloodstream. Even short-term exposure to particulates increases the risk of asthma, heart disease and premature death.

To determine whether coal-fired power plants continued to obey the rules even when environmental inspectors were furloughed and not watching, we examined data on emissions of more than 200 coal-fired power plants across the country. We looked at satellite data from NASA that provides a reliable indicator of particulate pollution in the atmosphere. We also looked at the amounts of several types of chemicals recorded directly from smokestacks and sent to the EPA.

We looked at each plant’s daily emissions before, during and after the 2018-2019 shutdown, and compared them with the plants’ emissions on the same calendar days in the five previous years, when EPA inspectors were not furloughed.

Pollution rose and fell with the shutdown

We found that as soon as the EPA furlough began in 2018, particulate emissions within 1.8 miles (3 kilometers) around the coal-fired power plants rose, according to the NASA data.

The data indicated that, on average, particulate matter during the 2018 and 2019 shutdown was 15% to 20% higher than it had been during the same period in the preceding five years.

And once the EPA inspectors returned to work, the plants’ average particulate pollution dropped back to its pre-shutdown level.

We also found that two other common air pollutants from coal-fired power plants, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, did not increase during the furlough period. Those gases, unlike particulate matter, are continuously monitored by sensors inside coal plants’ smokestacks, even when the federal government is not operating. Particulate emissions, however, are not continuously monitored: Enforcement of those emissions standards relies on the manual collection of samples from monitors and on-site inspections, both of which halted during the shutdown.

The pattern was clear: When the EPA stopped watching, coal plants increased pollution. And once inspections resumed, emissions dropped back to normal.

Considering various explanations

To confirm that the increase in particulate pollution during the shutdown was due to the lack of inspections and not because of some other factors such as weather fluctuations, we tested a range of alternative explanations and found that they did not fit the data we had collected.

For example, weather records showed that wind, humidity and temperature at and around the coal plants during the shutdown were all within the same ranges as they had been over the previous five years. So the increased particulate pollution during the shutdown was not due to different weather conditions.

Electricity demand – how much power the plants were generating – was also typical, and did not increase significantly during the shutdown. That means the coal plants weren’t polluting more just because they were being asked to produce more electricity.

Our analysis also revealed that the coal plants didn’t shift which particular boilers were operating to less efficient ones that would have produced more particulates. So the increase in pollution during the shutdown wasn’t due to just using different equipment to generate electricity.

The emissions data we collected also included carbon dioxide emissions, which gave us insight into what the coal plants were burning. With similar weather conditions and amounts of electricity generated, different types of coal emit different amounts of carbon dioxide. So if we had found carbon dioxide emissions changed, it could have signaled that the plants had changed to burning another type of coal, which could emit more particulate matter – but we did not. This showed us that the increase in particulate emissions was not from changing the specific types of coal being burned to generate electricity.

All of these tests helped us determine that the spike in particulate matter pollution was unique to the 2018–2019 EPA furlough.

Spewing particulate matter

All of this analysis led us to one final question: Was it, in fact, possible for coal-fired power plants to quickly increase – and then decrease – the amount of particulate matter they emit? The answer is yes. Emissions-control technology does indeed allow that to happen.

Power plants control their particulate emissions with a device called an electrostatic precipitator, which uses static electricity to collect particles from smoke and exhaust before it exits the smokestack. Those devices use electricity to run, which costs money, even for a power plant. Turning them off when the plants are being monitored risks incurring heavy fines. But when oversight disappeared, the power plants could save money by turning those devices off or reducing their operation, with less risk of being caught and fined.

Our findings indicate that air pollution regulations are only as effective as their enforcement, which had already been decreasing before the 2018 shutdown. Between 2007 and 2018, EPA’s enforcement staff declined by more than 20%, and the number of inspections dropped by one-third.

Since the new administration took office in January 2025, EPA staffing has been reduced significantly. We found that without strong and continuous monitoring and enforcement, environmental laws risk becoming hollow promises.

After utility bills skyrocketed over the summer, an energy company is taking strides to make it up to customers, handing out energy bill credits and lowering monthly rates.

Many American consumers saw their energy bills spike this summer, running them hundreds or even thousands of dollars more than anticipated.

A handful of energy companies are responding to customer complaints about their skyrocketing bills, rolling out programs or credits to help ease the burden of rising energy costs.

One company, for example, is launching two key “Community Affordability Actions” to lend a helping hand to its customers and the communities that rely on its services.

As part of the initiative to “prioritize customer affordability,” CenterPoint Energy customers in Southwestern Indiana will soon see a new energy credit pop up on their bills, per a company news release from last week.

The company is reducing its customers’ bills by roughly $3 per month by the end of this year via a combination of bill adjustments and credits, aimed at offsetting rate changes that rolled out in October.

The first phase of CenterPoint Energy’s affordability actions will also include a move to “stabilize electricity bills by keeping any rate change below or near the rate of inflation for the next two years,” per the news release.

This action will begin in the first quarter of 2026 and amount to savings of roughly $18 per month for residential customers through the following year, which comes out to about $432 in avoided costs over the two year span.

“We have clearly heard our customers’ concerns about energy affordability. We sincerely apologize for our customers’ frustration and are determined to take action,” Mike Roeder, president of CenterPoint Energy Indiana, said in the release.

“Going forward, we will continue to engage with our customers, stakeholders, elected officials and community leaders to listen, gather feedback and identify ways to further address concerns and prioritize affordability, while also continuing to prioritize providing reliable power for our customers across Southwestern Indiana.”

WALLET PAINS

Many consumer advocates have argued that CenterPoint Energy’s efforts are meager in comparison to just how much customers’ energy bills have spiked.

The company recently finished pushing for an electrical base rate bump that resulted in residential bills jumping by 25% on average compared to 2024, per the state’s latest residential bill survey.

The higher rates stem from CenterPoint Energy’s authorized $80 million annual revenue increase to recover costs for infrastructure and grid modernization projects.

Three bucks does not provide much of a dent in households’ utility bills, Christopher Norrick, a representative with Direct Action Against CenterPoint Energy, told a local outlet.

“In what has happened with this 25% increase year over year, that’s not even in a drop in the bucket,” he said. “It’s almost offensive in my opinion, if you’re claiming to want to provide some significant relief.

“It’s kind of a slap in the face when folks are making some very difficult choices.”

Some Indiana residents have admitted that the rate hikes have forced them to choose between buying groceries and medicine or covering their mounting energy bills.

Residents, both online and at Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission hearings, have pleaded with both CenterPoint Energy and state officials for many years to avoid hiking rates.

Indiana State Representative Alex Burton argued that CenterPoint Energy’s recent affordability actions are a step in the right direction, but emphasized that more needs to be done to help out residents.

“We have to keep working towards solutions and finding long-term goals and solutions that are greater than, you know, $20 in savings,” Burton told the local outlet.

The state representative admitted that, as consumers search for new ways to contend with overall inflation, legislators like himself also have a responsibility.

“Making sure that Hoosiers are able to live within Indiana as opposed to moving over the bridge into Kentucky where the cost of living is cheaper,” said Burton.

The president of CenterPoint Energy hopes that the company’s affordability actions, coupled with other initiatives it will reveal over the next few weeks and months, will serve as a first step in making amends with customers.

“I hope we’re beginning that today, really. We know we have to earn back the trust that we’ve lost in this community,” Roeder told the local outlet.

“As a result of the Care Lab experience, they’ve been able to ratchet down conflict between their bosses, discuss legislation, and take on new projects together,” said Sarah Stephens, executive director of Care Lab.
But both Care Lab and BPC have conducted multiple bipartisan events for members and staff this year.
Increasingly, with the margins in Congress between the parties so slim, bipartisan collaboration is required to be an effective legislator.
The next great bipartisan deal may be hatched in a Capitol Hill apartment over whiskey and cheese.","A few years ago I was at Eastern Market in Washington, waiting in line at Bowers Fancy Dairy Products to pick some good Vermont cheddar. Coming in behind me was a member of Congress I knew, (now former) Rep. Dean Phillips, D-Minn. I asked him what brought him to Eastern Market. He said, “Shhh … I’m buying cheese for a bipartisan whiskey tasting at my apartment tonight.”

Despite the barrage of hyperpartisan rhetoric flung on an hourly basis by members of Congress of both parties, there are still bipartisan gatherings that serve as havens. Even during the government shutdown, plans are underway to continue with bipartisan staff and member events.

When I worked in the Senate, our office had the good fortune to get a detailee from the military for a year, a brilliant Air Force colonel. After a few months he offered us this analysis of the difference between the military and Congress. “In the military,” he said, “the generals get together behind closed doors, scream at each other — then come out in front of the cameras and pretend they’re friends. In Congress the members get together behind closed doors, usually talk reasonably with one another, then get out in front of the cameras and scream at each other.”

These bipartisan gatherings are more than just social events; they often lead to legislative relationships. The nucleus of the “gang” that wrote the major 2021 infrastructure bill was Senate Democrat Kyrsten Sinema and Senate Republican Rob Portman. They had bonded years earlier on a civil rights trip to Selma, Ala. Congressional travel is a common way for legislators to become friends, which often leads to valuable legislation benefiting the nation.

Another great bipartisan program is the American Congressional Exchange program operated by the Bipartisan Policy Center. The program pairs two members — a Democrat and Republican — who agree to travel to each other’s districts. They hold town hall meetings, meet with community leaders, and generally get a firsthand sense of their colleague’s districts. Since its creation, 64 members of Congress have participated in 54 trips.

“They’re grateful for these opportunities to find commonalities, learn from each other, and build bonds of trust that are foundational to effective legislating and solving problems,” said John Richter, director of the Governing and Civics Project at BPC and a former Senate chief of staff.

Senate chiefs of staff also have participated in regular dinners hosted by a nonprofit, Care Lab. More than half of all Senate chiefs have attended an event, with topics ranging from conflict deescalation to reducing stress in the workplace.

“As a result of the Care Lab experience, they’ve been able to ratchet down conflict between their bosses, discuss legislation, and take on new projects together,” said Sarah Stephens, executive director of Care Lab.

One might think that the onset of Trump’s second term would be an end to events like this. But both Care Lab and BPC have conducted multiple bipartisan events for members and staff this year.

The Congressional Women’s Softball Game has become another catalyst for bipartisan relationships. Unlike the men’s congressional baseball game, which pits the Democrats against the Republicans, the women’s team is bipartisan, and their opposing team is composed of female members of the media. “Because we’re on the same team on the field, we can work together and form teams in Congress to fight for issues that are important to women,” said Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., co-founder of the game.

Increasingly, with the margins in Congress between the parties so slim, bipartisan collaboration is required to be an effective legislator. Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., for example, has appeared at or near the top of both the University of Virginia’s Center for Effective Lawmaking scorecard and the Lugar Center-McCourt School Bipartisan Index.

Former House Energy and Commerce Chair Fred Upton, R-Mich., regularly encouraged bipartisan collaboration as a way to make his committee more effective.

“When you had bipartisan amendments go first in line [in committee] and pass, it sent a pretty strong signal that this was a bill that ought to go to the House floor,” Upton said. “I look back and had a wonderful bunch of friends who were instrumental and helpful on legislative issues. When you go to the other side of the aisle and say, ‘I really need your help,’ often they were with you if you had a personal relationship.”

Who knows? The next great bipartisan deal may be hatched in a Capitol Hill apartment over whiskey and cheese.

Trump’s Energy Policies Hurt Everyone, Including His Supporters Unfortunately, Trump has made political retaliation a hallmark of his second administration.","By propping up corporate profits and expensive fossil fuels, Trump’s policies are raising our energy bills during a cost-of-living crisis.

Look at any news publication around the country right now, and you’ll see headlines declaring that energy prices are up everywhere. Not only that, but people are seeing record-setting utility bills.

On the campaign trail, Trump promised to slash energy bills in half. Instead, nine months into his presidency, families are facing greater financial hardship than a year ago.

It’s one thing for Trump to gamble and fail at personal business ventures, but he’s playing with our dollars. Thanks to his policies, energy costs are rising at twice the rate of inflation. Let’s dive into some of the ways Trump is making life more expensive for us all.

Trump’s Obsession with Fossil Fuels Comes at Our Expense

We know from Trump’s first presidency that he’s a friend to the fossil fuel industry. Now, that friendship has turned into an obsession. On Trump’s first day in office, he declared a “national energy emergency” and signed an executive order promising to “unleash American energy”. What does he have to show for it? Broken promises and higher bills.

By forcing the nation to cater to the fossil fuel industry, he’s putting us in an increasingly hard financial position. Other Trump policies are adding more fuel to the fire. Here are some of his most egregious moves:

1. Fast-tracking liquefied natural gas projects

Exporting liquified natural gas (LNG) makes U.S. energy prices vulnerable to volatile changes in the global market. This will drive up energy prices here at home.

The natural gas industry, especially, has positioned itself as affordable. Yet these promises have proved empty. For example, Pennsylvania is the second-largest gas producer in the country, but that has failed to translate into lower energy bills for residents.

With Trump’s support of gas infrastructure, from LNG terminals to pipelines, he’s locking us into a volatile and expensive energy source.

2. Attempting to revive ugly, dirty coal

The United States began phasing out coal because it’s incredibly polluting, bad for miners’ health, and expensive. Trump seems to think that, if you say a thing often enough, it will eventually come true. But for “clean, beautiful coal”, it simply will never exist.

By forcing aging coal power plants to stay open, Trump is actually costing taxpayers $3-6 billion per year. And by one analysis, replacing almost every coal plant with solar and wind energy generation would be both cost-effective and save people big in the long run.

3. Accelerating the data center boom

From Alabama to California, Pennsylvania to Texas, communities around the country are facing proposed data centers that threaten grid instability and high electricity prices.

Instead of addressing these concerns and their tangible harms, the Trump administration has moved to fast-track the build-out of these energy-greedy data centers. Ratepayers in seven states already paid $4.4 billion more on their bills last year to bring data centers online, before this year’s boom.

More data centers demand more energy to power them — and that’s mainly coming from cost-volatile fossil fuels. With Trump’s help, Big Tech companies like Meta, Microsoft, and Amazon get to profit off our land and resources while polluting our communities.

4. Cutting energy affordability programs

Federal programs help millions of families keep the lights on and regulate a home’s temperature — which is evermore critical as fossil-fueled climate change makes summers hotter and winters colder.

The Low Income Home Energy Assistance program (LIHEAP) provides assistance to families to pay their heating and cooling bills. As volatile gas prices make energy bills jump — thanks to things like LNG and increased fossil fuel production — affordability programs are even more important.

Instead of securing people’s safety, Trump has fired all staff running LIHEAP, effectively freezing assistance. Trampling over affordability programs will have real, terrible consequences. In one Arizona county, some 400 people may have died as a result of extreme heat this past summer.

As climate-warming emissions cause heat to intensify, the cost of electricity and air conditioning rise higher, causing more people to die — with a disproportionate impact on Indigenous, Black, and Brown communities.

Tossing Renewables While Keeping Fossil Fuels Is Costing Us

Trump’s senseless war on solar and wind is costing us.

Don’t be fooled — renewables are not to blame for rising electricity bills. Study after study has confirmed that energy generated from wind and solar is cheaper than that from fossil fuels, even without subsidies. Despite this, Trump is positioning fossil fuels as the only hope for our energy future.

While Trump’s predecessor was no climate champion, Joe Biden set the stage for the recent boom of solar and wind. So far, the industry is holding strong, but progress is set to stall as tax credits for renewable projects expire at the end of this year. What will result is higher bills and more pollution.

Support for clean energy leads to lower energy costs, lower healthcare costs from less pollution, and fewer costly climate disasters and billion-dollar recovery and adaptation bills. This especially benefits low-income, Black, Brown, and Indigenous communities that have borne the brunt of these costs exacted by fossil fuels.

Supporting renewables also levels the playing field against fossil fuels, which have been ludicrously subsidized for decades. The fossil fuel industry receives $760 billion annually through subsidies, tax breaks, and other factors. Direct government subsidies account for $10-$52 billion per year.

Ironically, Energy Czar Chris Wright has said that the United States must stop subsidizing solar and wind because it drives up costs. He must have gotten his wires crossed, because that’s exactly what has happened with fossil fuels — lots of subsidies, higher energy prices for us. But what else do you expect from a fossil fuel CEO-turned Department of Energy Secretary?

If Trump valued affordable energy, public health, or the environment, he’d support renewables. Instead, his energy policies prioritize profits for his fossil fuel industry buddies.

Trump’s Energy Policies Hurt Everyone, Including His Supporters

Unfortunately, Trump has made political retaliation a hallmark of his second administration. In the early days of October’s government shutdown, Trump, Energy Czar Wright, and Russel Vought “of Project 2025 fame” were giddy to slash over $7.5 billion in green energy projects, all in states that voted for his opponent Kamala Harris in the 2024 election.

While the cancellations may be meant to punish Trump’s perceived enemies, the harm will reach his supporters and their families, too. Of the terminated grants and projects, 26 grants were intended to improve electricity grid resilience and lower energy costs, impacting dozens of Republican districts.

Energy markets and grids know no political affiliation. Trump’s cancellation impacts cannot be isolated to a single state or region, and instead will produce a ripple effect across the country.

Similarly, his war on solar and wind is hitting his supporters hard. His cuts of Inflation Reduction Act clean energy projects are slashing jobs and impacting local economies for many in his base.

If our president can’t be a president to all and put our economic well-being ahead of his own, that should set alarm bells off for everyone in the country.

Join Our Fight For Affordable Energy!

It turns out that a pro-business approach to a country built on the backs of the working class and families is bad for everyone. While our bills go up, Trump is playing golf, earning billions from his meme coin, and undermining democracy and our futures.

We know what makes our energy more reliable and affordable: going green and transitioning to renewables like solar and wind. In the midst of a cost-of-living crisis, Trump is just adding avoidable, unnecessary costs by doubling down on fossil fuels. He is doing incredible damage to our economy and our wallets.",https://www.foodandwaterwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Energy-Bills-Trump-Featured-Image-1024x427.png,N,,2025-10-29 13:09:26.685364

In 2023, El Niño reduced crop yields, drove up volatility in agriculture commodity markets, and dried sections of the Panama Canal, temporarily choking off nearly 6 percent of global maritime commerce. Disruptions like these reverberate across supply chains, amplifying the costs of food, fuel, medicines, and household essentials, and often translating into fewer meals and deteriorating health outcomes for children.

Trade also contributes to climate change. Global trade is estimated to account for nearly 23 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions. The expansion of international markets for resource-intensive goods can accelerate deforestation, biodiversity loss, and unsustainable production practices. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), cobalt mining for global supply chains has intensified deforestation, while exposing children to hazardous labour conditions.

At the same time, trade has been a powerful engine for expanding the global market for environmental goods and services, from clean energy to agricultural innovations. The fall in the price of solar technology is directly linked to global competition and investment. In countries such as Tanzania and Uganda, foreign direct investments have enabled off-grid solar markets to thrive, while giving children access to reliable electricity for lighting and study.

Climate and trade policy interactions

Governments are increasingly aligning trade policies with their decarbonization goals, but their design often overlooks child well-being. The most prominent examples are associated with the European Union’s (EU) Green Deal, which includes the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), the EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR), among others. These green trade measures aim to accelerate the green transition by reshaping value chains and influencing supply and demand. However, they are also likely to squeeze economies in developing countries, especially Africa, that rely on exports of goods impacted by these measures (“green squeeze”). For example, the EUDR is expected to reconfigure supply chains for commodities like palm oil, soy, and cocoa, impacting major producers in Southeast Asia, South America, and West Africa. In particular, the EUDR could jeopardize incomes for smallholder families who are dependent on these exports, leading to higher risks of poverty and reduced child well-being.

However, trade fragmentation and protectionism can hinder the green transition. A hypothetical scenario of fragmented trade in critical minerals could lead to significant price swings and lower investment in renewable energy, thus making decarbonizing the global economy more difficult. Rising trade tensions and policy uncertainty could hit the solar, battery, wind and electric vehicle industries hard, disrupting supply chains and raising costs due to tariffs. The resulting uncertainty could indirectly impact families reliant on industries connected to global green supply chains. For instance, previous tariffs increases on solar cells and modules in the US led to the loss of more than 62,000 US jobs and $19 billion in new private sector investment.

Green policies themselves are reshaping trade dynamics. In India, a government push for renewable energy has made it one of the largest markets for solar power globally and a major exporter of solar PV modules. In the US, green economic incentives in the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022 aim to promote competitiveness in clean energy technologies, which can reconfigure global supply chains. However, these domestic incentives can also escalate trade tensions, with critics arguing that certain IRA provisions violate WTO rules by giving domestic companies an unfair advantage. Establishing environmental regulations can also lead to adverse effects on export trade and employment in the short-term but they can encourage technological innovation and boost competitiveness in the long-run.

A persistent challenge comes from environmentally harmful subsidies. Agricultural incentives in developed countries that encourage overproduction of carbon-intensive crops not only contribute to global emissions but also skew international competition. These subsidies disadvantage small farmers in developing countries, threatening household resilience and reducing access to affordable, nutritious food for children.

Despite incremental progress, trade remains underrepresented in global climate governance. The Paris Agreement makes little reference to trade although parties to the Agreement have discussed trade as part of their cooperation in several technical bodies. Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) occasionally cite trade as part of adaptation or mitigation strategies, but the mention of direct trade measures (such as tariffs) is far less prevalent and rarely in ways that consider social equity or children’s needs. The lack of integration between child rights, trade rules, and climate commitments represents a critical gap in global governance.

Implications for Children’s Well-Being

The trade–climate nexus creates multiple pathways through which children’s lives are directly impacted. Four areas—health, food and nutrition, household economic security, and education—are particularly significant.

Children’s Health at Risk

Children are disproportionately affected by pollution and environmental degradation. Trade-driven industrialization and transport are major contributors to air and water pollution. Roughly 20-33 per cent of CO2 emissions and 30 per cent of inhalable particulate matter emissions are linked to international trade. The consequences include higher rates of respiratory illnesses, developmental issues and other long-term health problems in children.

Climate change is also amplifying health risks. As vectors of disease expand geographically and become more active, children face greater exposure to malaria, dengue, and waterborne illnesses. Trade policy plays a decisive role here. Africa currently imports more than 99 per cent of its vaccines and 95 per cent of its medicines. Efficient supply chains enable rapid responses to outbreaks, but disruptions—from trade barriers to logistical challenges—can slow vaccine distribution and expose children to preventable illness.

Nutritional Security in a Changing Climate

Food and nutrition are among the most immediate concerns for children in a warming world. Climate change is disrupting agri-food supply chains, making it harder to ensure a steady flow of nutritious food, especially in regions already facing food insecurity. By 2050, between 1.5 and 6 billion people may rely on international trade for basic food security. For children, disrupted flows of staple foods like wheat, maize, and rice mean greater risks of malnutrition, stunting, and impaired cognitive development.

Trade restrictions exacerbate the problem. While there are several reasons why governments may impose export restrictions on food and fertilizer, one rising factor is climate change. As extreme weather events and crop failures cause domestic shortages, it can prompt countries to limit exports to ensure food security. While politically understandable, such measures frequently drive up global food prices, disproportionately affecting poor households. Children are the first to feel the effects, as families shift to cheaper, less nutritious diets or skip meals altogether. Conversely, when trade policies prioritize open markets and climate-resilient supply chains, they can buffer families against climate impacts on food supply.

Household Economic Security

Parents’ economic security has a direct bearing on children’s well-being. The trade-climate nexus is reshaping labour markets, creating winners and losers across regions and sectors. For example, India’s rapid growth in solar panel export market is projected to create over 1.7 million new jobs in the next three years. These jobs bring income stability that supports children’s nutrition, education, and healthcare in households employed in them.

Yet the intersection of trade and climate can also undermine livelihoods. For instance, 2 per cent of employment is exposed to the impacts of CBAM in Moldova and Mozambique. These workers could face unemployment, lower wages, and unskilling. Without targeted transition support, families may be forced to cut education costs, rely on child labour, or reduce food intake, directly harming children.

Households in developing countries are particularly impacted by the green squeeze. The Africa region and least Developed Countries (LDCs) are especially susceptible because they lack the resources to comply. For households tied to such industries, the result may be job losses, lower wages, and heightened poverty.

In LDCs, the green squeeze could hurt an already constrained fiscal space, putting children's education and healthcare at risk. For instance, in Ethiopia, an increase in export requirements by 10 per cent under the EUDR could lead to a 0.7 per cent fall in GDP. Tax revenue could go down by more than 2 per cent, reducing in turn public expenditure. Wages would also go down, especially to workers without secondary education. Already, social sector spending in Ethiopia is under threat due to an extremely tight fiscal space, constrained by a declining tax-to-GDP ratio and high levels of debt distress. In this context, the EUDR could be double whammy for Ethiopia with negative impacts on poverty and child labour. At the same time, the EU will generate additional revenue from carbon taxes and other green trade measures. But there's no binding commitment yet to share these gains with the LDCs bearing the brunt of these policies.

Education and the Future of Work

The shift toward sustainable trade is reshaping skills demand, underscoring the need for education systems to prepare young people for the jobs of the future. On one hand, emerging green sectors are driving demand for skills in fields like renewable energy systems, green engineering, and sustainable logistics. On the other, the decline of carbon-intensive exporting sectors could lead to potential job displacement for youth. With appropriate investments, young people could thrive amid these labour market transitions. However, most education systems are not equipped to prepare today’s children for tomorrow’s green jobs. Few curricula emphasize green skills development, and financing and access to green skills development and entrepreneurship support programmes remain limited. Mismatches between labour market demand and what is being taught in schools, and lack of accessible retraining and upskilling programmes exacerbate the issue,

Meanwhile, rising demand for critical minerals like cobalt and lithium has intensified child labour in mining sectors. In the DRC, the demand for cobalt for batteries has been linked to a troubling rise in child labour and a drop in school attendance. Instead of acquiring skills for a green future, these children are exposed to toxic substances and hazardous labour, with lifelong consequences.

Policy pathways for child-sensitive trade and climate action

The trade–climate nexus is not only about emissions or GDP, but about childhood itself. If policies continue to neglect the impact of the trade-climate nexus on children, they risk embedding inequality into the global system for decades to come. Conversely, if trade and climate policies are designed with children in mind, they can become powerful tools for resilience, equity, and opportunity.

Children must no longer be an afterthought and be at the heart of how we design the future of trade and climate action. To address this, governments and multilateral institutions must embed children’s rights into trade and climate governance. Five pathways stand out:

Promote Climate-Resilient Health and Nutrition in Trade Policies

Trade policies should lower tariff and non-tariff barriers to the flow of nutritious foods, vaccines, and medical supplies, particularly in the event of climate-induced shortages. Regional cooperation agreements can be designed to facilitate climate-sensitive food and pharmaceutical regional value chains and boost local production hubs. Prioritizing these flows ensures that children’s basic health and nutritional needs are met even during climate shocks.

Incentivize Sustainable Trade Practices

Aligning trade with environmental standards is essential. Governments should phase out harmful subsidies that encourage unsustainable production, while fostering markets for eco-friendly goods and services. Implement clear labeling schemes and certifications for eco-friendly products to guide consumer choices and encourage companies to adopt sustainable practices. Governments can also offer financial incentives for businesses that meet high sustainability standards and enforce stricter regulations on pollution and hazardous waste to protect children's health.

Invest in Green Skills Development

Education systems must be reoriented to prepare children for the green economy. This includes integrating green foundational skills in primary and secondary education curricula, offering market-relevant occupational training at vocational and higher education levels, and ensuring equitable access to girls and marginalized groups. Partnerships with the private sector and a focus on Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) fields are crucial to build a skilled workforce capable of tackling climate challenges and leverage innovation and entrepreneurship opportunities through trade.

Strengthen Social Protection Systems

Families require safety nets to withstand trade and climate shocks. Scaling up cash transfers, food aid, and active labour market programmes for reskilling and livelihood diversification can shield children from poverty and child labour. Evidence shows that robust social protection reduces the intergenerational transmission of disadvantage, making it an essential component of climate-resilient trade policy.

Address research and evidence gaps

There is a need to develop comprehensive evaluation frameworks to analyse how the trade-climate nexus directly impacts children’s health, education, and nutrition. Filling these knowledge gaps will empower development partners to advocate for child-sensitive trade measures within climate action plans and NDCs, as well as trade negotiations and policy processes.",https://www.unicef.org/innocenti/sites/unicef.org.innocenti/files/styles/open_graph_image/public/UNI847774.webp.jpeg?itok=XJiJu1Vq,N,,2025-10-29 15:19:27.280184

By David Shepardson and Nora Eckert

DETROIT (Reuters) -General Motors said on Wednesday it will cut U.S. electric vehicle and battery production and 1,200 factory jobs at its EV plant in Detroit, as the automaker responds to a significant slowdown in demand for its battery cars.

The Detroit automaker said it will halt battery cell production at its two U.S. joint-venture battery plants - in Tennessee and Ohio - in January for about six months. It added it will temporarily lay off about 1,550 workers at the factories.

In addition, at the Ohio plant, GM said it will lay off 550 workers indefinitely. GM operates the Ohio plant jointly with South Korea's LG Energy Solution.

GM said it will cut production at its Detroit EV plant to just one shift starting in January, compared with the two shifts at present. This will cut output by about 50%, it said. The plant produces three large electric pickup trucks, including the Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra, as well as the EV Escalade IQ and Hummer SUV.

GM said the cuts were ""in response to slower near-term EV adoption and an evolving regulatory environment.""

GM has been paring its outlook for EV sales after the Trump administration slashed a key federal incentive, which further dampened already-slowing demand.

A $7,500 tax credit on battery-powered models expired at the end of September, and the U.S. government has further loosened vehicle-emissions regulations, which has weighed on EV sales.

The Detroit automaker took a $1.6 billion charge earlier this month related to changes in its EV strategy.

That divergence will be on display when the presidents of the world’s leading gas and renewable producers meet Thursday.

President Donald Trump has doubled down on fossil fuels since returning to the White House, serving as salesman-in-chief as he pressures allies and trade partners into buying more American oil and gas. The approach contrasts sharply with China, which under President Xi Jinping has emerged as a clean energy superpower. China is rapidly expanding its renewable capacity while flooding global markets with solar panels, batteries and electric vehicles.

The two strategies are increasingly in tension, particularly in Asia, where energy consumption is expected to soar as economies expand in the coming years.

“The U.S. and China, moving forward, are trying to sell rival energy export models with the U.S. built around fossil fuels and the Chinese built around cheap renewables,” said Gregory Brew, an energy analyst at the Eurasia Group. “It’s unclear who’s going to come out ahead.”

The already fractious relationship has grown even frostier in Trump’s second term. The president imposed sweeping tariffs on Chinese goods early this year. Beijing retaliated with a ban on critical minerals shipments to the U.S. and stopped buying American soybeans and shiploads of liquefied natural gas. Trump and Xi are expected to meet in South Korea on Thursday on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in what would be their first face-to-face meeting since Trump’s first term.

Energy is a top-tier issue for both countries, as both target Asian market for their exports. Electricity demand in Southeast Asia alone is expected to double by 2050, while Asia more broadly is set to account for about half of global growth in gas demand by the end of the decade, according to the International Energy Agency.

Many countries in the region feel torn between the U.S. and China. Leaders are wary of shifting too aggressively in the direction of one or the other, said Ben Cahill, the lead oil and gas analyst at the University of Texas, Austin’s Center for Energy and Environmental Systems.

The U.S. and China are appealing to consumers for different reasons. American LNG is increasingly cheap, thanks to a wave of new supply expected to come online in the coming years. Chinese-made solar panels are easy to install and limit countries’ exposure to the fluctuations in global gas prices.

“It’s not a binary decision that countries make,” Cahill said. Gas could be especially appealing to countries like Bangladesh, Pakistan and Thailand, all of which have gas infrastructure. But the falling price of solar technologies, coupled with the reliability of batteries, could be increasingly attractive to countries in the future.

Supply surge

Global LNG supply is expected to increase 50 percent by 2030, thanks to a new generation of export terminals that are set to come online in the U.S. and Qatar, according to the International Energy Agency. That’s a recipe for lower gas prices and higher demand. Gas prices are expected to be 40 percent lower globally over the next five years, compared to the previous five, according to IEA, prompting a 9 percent jump in global gas consumption by 2030. Much of that growth is expected to come from Asia.

“The best way to increase gas penetration in Southeast Asia is to make it more abundant and cheaper,” Cahill said. “I think we’re heading in that direction.”

Yet there are limits to LNG’s growth. Even if gas is increasingly a bargain, building the regasification terminals that are needed to import it are expensive. India, the second-largest energy consumer in Asia, has limited LNG import capacity. Trump has pushed India to invest in LNG, but the country has so far resisted, analysts said.

Against that backdrop, Chinese-made solar panels have emerged as a low-cost alternative. Demand in India for Chinese solar cells is up 52 percent over the first half of 2025, helping fuel a boom in solar generation. India is expected to triple its renewable capacity by 2030, with solar accounting for 60 percent of that increase.

Even countries that have LNG infrastructure are adopting solar in greater quantities. Pakistan was rocked by an energy crisis after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine sent global gas prices skyrocketing. The country had trouble securing LNG cargoes to offset declining production from its domestic gas fields and keep its grid running.

Many Pakistani homeowners responded to surging electricity prices and grid blackouts by installing rooftop solar. The country imported 17 gigawatts of solar panels in 2024, a staggering sum in a nation that has 40 GW of total power generating capacity.

“Pakistan is a perfect example of how this could play out,” said Brew of the Eurasia Group. ”U.S. LNG is competing with solar, it’s competing with wind, it’s competing with nuclear anywhere where power demand is likely to increase. China has cornered the market on solar PV, at the very least.”

China stopped buying U.S. LNG

Trump views energy as bargaining chip within wider trade discussions. A White House official said the president’s aim is to secure more favorable treatment for American exports like LNG in exchange for granting foreign companies access to the U.S. market.

“The Trump administration is committed to rectifying America’s historic trade deficits, trade deficits that have hollowed out critical domestic manufacturing and undermined American workers,” White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement. “Purchases of American energy, including LNG, would go a long way towards rectifying longstanding trade deficits with the United States that are driven by the unfair trade barriers that other countries have imposed against American exports.”

Trump has gotten more buy-in from agency heads since returning to the White House to identify unfair trade practices and export opportunities, said George David Banks, who led international climate policy during Trump’s first term.

Administration officials like Energy Secretary Chris Wright ultimately think that demand for energy will trump countries’ climate commitments, Banks said.

Nevertheless, he added, “There’s no question that you have a sense in the administration that the international climate, anti-fossil fuel agenda is a liability to the U.S., and it threatens the future of export markets for the United States.”

Analysts say the amount of LNG the U.S. wants to export will likely exceed demand. And many of the recent commitments countries have made to purchase LNG as part of trade deals lack details. In Europe, they don’t align with market realities.

LNG demand in Asia would need to roughly double over the next seven years to meet the amount of gas capacity that has been contracted or is under construction, said Anne-Sophie Corbeau, an expert on natural gas and hydrogen at Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy.

“Japan, Korea and China won’t double,” she said in an email, noting that Japan and Korea are mature markets with declining populations. China, she added, is trying to reduce its dependence on LNG imports — particularly from the U.S. — as it ramps up electrification using coal and renewables, two resources it has in abundance.

Trump’s Asia tour has exposed the promise, and limits, of Trump’s LNG push. He arrived in Tokyo with hopes of formalizing Japan’s commitment to invest $550 billion in the U.S. — including a $44 billion LNG export terminal in Alaska. He left with promises to continue negotiating on funding for an LNG terminal in Alaska, but no firm deal. That project’s economics are challenging because it would require building an 800-mile pipeline, analysts said.

Japan is broadly supportive of America’s LNG growth, Cahill said. Japanese firms have contracted for large amounts of U.S. LNG in recent years, prizing the security of supply and flexibility offered by U.S. shippers. If Japanese buyers can fetch a higher price for the LNG they have contracted to buy, they can ship it to other countries.

But there are limits to how far Japan is willing to go. The country has gradually restarted its nuclear reactors in the wake of the Fukushima disaster in 2011, prompting LNG imports to fall.

China presents another dilemma. It has stopped buying U.S. LNG cargoes in retaliation for tariffs Trump placed on Chinese goods earlier this year. Whether Trump can secure a deal that would allow a resumption of U.S. shipments to the world’s largest gas consumer is one of the big questions heading into his talks with Xi.

“The U.S. wants to dominate the fossil fuel world, and they will definitely dominate the LNG world. But whether China wants to remain dependent on LNG, and in particular U.S. LNG, remains questionable,” said Corbeau.

“Unless Trump reverses what’s happening with China,” she added, “he is going to find that the LNG market is a bit smaller than before.”",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/93/25/c49aeadc480288ce629f9f56e3ff/japan-trump-asia-51281.jpg,N,,2025-10-29 13:14:00.749192

Using AI to optimize energy efficiency

Demand and maintenance

Protecting critical energy infrastructure from cyber threats

A more detailed recap will appear in the Nov. 3 issue of NJBIZ.

Going up

In June, New Jersey consumers saw significant energy rate hikes. At the time, residential electricity bills rose between 17% and 20% — or roughly $22 to $28 more per month for an average household.

Higher wholesale and capacity costs in PJM Interconnection LLC’s regional power market, and a supply outpaced by demand, largely drove the increases.

To ease the impact, state regulators approved a temporary $60 summer bill credit. Additionally, they extended protections against shut-offs for low-income and vulnerable customers.

Fazelpoor described it as a “prominent issue” in the Nov. 4 gubernational election between Democrat Mikie Sherrill and Republican Jack Ciattarelli.

“In other campaigns, energy’s mentioned, but not always. Property taxes and affordability in New Jersey is always top of mind,” he said. “If not the top issue right now, it is one of the top two, three issues in the state that’s being discussed everywhere.”

“It hits into all the other things going on – cost of living, health insurance, mortgage rates, everything,” he said. “And just the timing of it hitting June 1 right before summer, it definitely made an impact.”

Falling behind

Weigand-Jackson said, “I think what the business community is dealing with right now is just trying to understand why? And are we going to see this for the next couple of years? Is this just a one-off? I think from our perspective, this is going to be for a couple of years.”

Weigand-Jackson went on to explain that recent electricity price hikes and supply constraints stem largely from issues between PJM and Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.

For years, the back-and-forth over how to run capacity auctions has disrupted the usual three-year planning cycle, making it hard for power generators and developers – both fossil fuel and renewable – to plan new projects, she said.

As a result, generation hasn’t kept pace with rising demand driven by data centers, AI and cryptocurrency. She also blames PJM’s backlog of unprocessed renewable projects, higher natural gas prices, and outdated federal rules that kept some clean-energy projects out of the market. All of which have combined to tighten supply and push prices higher.

“There’s a lot happening in the market that over the past five or six years led to this point. So, it wasn’t as if one thing caused it. And it’s not something that’s going to get fixed overnight. But fundamentally the issues relate to the fact that we do not have enough supply to meet demand,” she said.

She went on to say, “The grid absolutely needs to be modernized. Our grid is this grid that we’ve had a hundred-plus years … And we have been investing in upgrades to the grid, but not specifically to support where this new generating assets would be coming online per se. And that’s why PJM has this really long queue of projects, because what they’re doing is assessing the impact on the transmission system.

“It is tied together – both transmission and generation – but we don’t know what the transmission upgrades are until PJM does their analysis.”

‘A long way to go’

Lewis said, “All of the utility companies throughout the state are really investing to support customers with decreasing their energy use. So, they’re putting more teams out there in terms of engagement and community engagement and doing outreach to really connect with the customers and ensure that even underserved communities and UEZ [Urban Enterprise Zone] zones are receiving that additional support so that they can help fund projects that will help decrease their utility bills.”

“Part of the goal is to decrease the customer’s energy use so that we can decrease that demand on the grid to support with less power outages and these issues while the utilities are still upgrading their infrastructure because they have a long way to go,” said Lewis, who works with JCP&L (FirstEnergy company Jersey Central Power & Light) through her role at TRC.

While offshore wind development in New Jersey remains at a standstill, panelists spoke about growing adoption of solar power across the state in recent years.

For example, Heller, a former senior vice president and general counsel of the New York Giants football team, noted that when NRG became a sponsor of MetLife Stadium about a decade ago, it added a ring of 1,350 solar panels on the roof of the East Rutherford property.

In the meantime, Redwood Materials has debuted a more direct way to reuse old EV batteries: putting them to work powering microgrids.","SPARKS, Nev. — When an EV battery dies somewhere in North America, there’s a good chance it’ll wind up here, among the sand and shrubs of the desert, to be reborn.

This is the home of the biggest lithium-ion battery recycling plant in the United States. It’s where run-down batteries from every rechargeable device you can imagine are stacked, sorted and stored in neat rows in a 32-acre graveyard beneath the pale blue sky.

Redwood Materials, the company that runs this plant, will eventually break them down into their components and extract valuable metals such as lithium, nickel and cobalt, which can be remade into new batteries.

As global demand for rechargeable batteries grows, recycling plants like this one can become an important source of raw materials — potentially displacing mines known for dire worker conditions, polluting the water and air and creating geopolitical tensions.

Those mines are the dirty underbelly of the renewable energy transition. But once a hunk of metal is pried from the earth, it can be reused basically forever. Enthusiasts dream of a world in which new batteries are made almost entirely from the scraps of their discarded predecessors.

China is furthest along in trying to realize that vision. It has more than 50 recycling plants the size of the facility in Nevada, and recyclers provide a tenth of the Chinese battery industry’s lithium and nearly a fifth of its nickel and cobalt, according to Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, a firm that analyzes battery supply chains. Robin Zeng Yuqun, the founder of China’s biggest battery maker, predicts that the country would have “no need” for new battery materials by 2042 because of recycling.

Globally, recyclers could supply about a third of the lithium, nickel and cobalt needed for batteries by 2040, according to Benchmark Mineral Intelligence.

In the United States, the battery recycling industry remains nascent. Many of Redwood Materials’ rivals are struggling — especially after Republicans repealed Biden-era support for EVs and battery manufacturing. And the recycling process still requires shipping materials back to Asia for incorporation in new batteries.

But the ultimate goal for American recyclers is to keep the whole process within the United States. That would allow the companies to make more money selling valuable refined materials to battery manufacturers, and it would give the country a domestic source of battery materials that doesn’t involve mines.

A battery graveyard in the desert

Truckloads of old batteries travel from all over North America to this flat, dusty field in the desert. It’s a good spot for a battery graveyard, because land in this part of the country provides relatively cheap storage, and arid conditions ensure that the old batteries don’t corrode.

Most lithium-ion batteries in the United States get recycled, and Redwood Materials executives say their company handles 90 percent of that. About 60,000 metric tons of junk rotates through the desert field each year. Most of it is scrap left over from battery factories, which typically leave about 10 percent of their raw material on the cutting-room floor. Redwood also collects old phones and other electronics from e-waste bins scattered across the country.

Company representatives say they’d like much more of their business to come from EV batteries, which each represent about $2,000 of metals and minerals wrapped in one neat package. Right now, EV batteries account for just under a quarter of Redwood’s business.

“We started Redwood almost too early,” said JB Straubel, who launched it in 2017 after co-founding Tesla, anticipating the wave of spent batteries that would follow the rise of EVs. “We saw the big opportunity coming in the future, and now we’re sort of in the midst of that pivot.”

The bulk of the EV batteries the company recycles these days are from cars sold about seven years ago, when EVs made up 2 percent of new car sales. That share has since grown to about 9 percent, so, in the future, there should be many more valuable batteries to recycle.

As batteries arrive at the plant, workers sort them into piles based on their size, chemistry and packaging.

They can later pull old batteries from different piles when trying to obtain a specified mix of minerals — for instance, combining a few EV batteries with some old electric toothbrushes and diabetic glucose monitors to get the right recipe.

When the materials are ready for recycling, workers load the batteries they need onto a truck and drive them up a winding road to the plant.

Breaking down batteries

Before the valuable materials in batteries can be extracted, they have to be separated from the cheaper components.

Workers change the acidity of the solution to pull out the nickel and cobalt and then evaporate the water to leave behind lithium. (The plant captures and recycles the water vapor to minimize water usage.)

After two hours, they’ve sorted out about 95 percent of the nickel, cobalt and lithium in the original battery — but all of it has bonded with sulfur to make nickel sulfate, cobalt sulfate and lithium sulfate, which have to be refined more before they can go into a new battery.

Redwood’s method for breaking down batteries is easier on the Earth than mining new metals, according to an independent analysis from researchers at Stanford University, the City University of Hong Kong and Kenyon College. Recycling batteries this way lowers carbon emissions 58 percent and water consumption 72 percent compared with conventional mining.

The process has its downsides: Redwood doesn’t recycle the cheaper materials in batteries. Instead, during the heating stage, the plastics, electrolytes and binders get turned into a mix of air pollutants that could cause health problems and environmental damage. Giant air filters help catch the harmful gases, releasing water vapor and CO2 as a by-product.

Other companies instead dunk the batteries in water and shred them into black mass — which doesn’t produce as much air pollution, but does use more water, a scarce commodity in the desert, and creates contaminated wastewater. This method can usually recover plastic, but it doesn’t recover electrolytes or the binders that hold batteries together.

To recycle every part of each battery, including all the electrolytes, workers would have to manually disassemble each pack and create a unique recycling process for hundreds of different battery designs and chemistries. Very few recyclers do this — usually in small quantities for specific products. “It’s extremely difficult to implement,” said Chiara Ferrara, associate professor of physical chemistry at the University of Milano-Bicocca in Italy.

Building new batteries

Redwood Materials sells the minerals it has sorted — enough to make 300,000 EV batteries a year — to companies in Asia that will refine them further into pure materials that can be made into new batteries.

But Redwood is expanding to take on the next step of the process: turning recovered minerals into “cathode active materials,” the stuff that makes up the positive end of a lithium-ion battery and most of its total cost.

If the company can master this step, it would fill a missing link in American battery recycling. Rather than exporting minerals abroad, it could sell cathode materials directly to U.S. battery makers, creating a more sustainable, domestic supply of critical minerals. The company has built a 130-foot-tall building to host the giant machines that are starting to turn minerals into cathode active materials in small quantities.

“The ambition is to have a similar structure to China,” said Beatrice Browning, who heads research on battery recycling technology at Benchmark Mineral Intelligence. China has built recycling hubs where nearby factories break batteries into black mass, extract key minerals, refine them into high-quality battery materials and then assemble new batteries.

In the meantime, Redwood Materials has debuted a more direct way to reuse old EV batteries: putting them to work powering microgrids. Most car batteries that come into the plant are too worn down for the heavy-duty work of accelerating a vehicle to highway speeds, but they still have enough life left in them to store energy from solar panels and slowly trickle power out after the sun goes down.

“Secondary use is a no-brainer,” said Zheng Chen, a nanoengineering professor at the University of California at San Diego. “You have a lot of old batteries which are still okay. It’s good to use them before you send them into the recycling process.”

Today, this is the only place in the United States where batteries get a second life. In a two-acre patch of desert next to the recycling plant, Redwood has hooked up 792 old car batteries to a solar array to power a miniature AI data center. It runs 24/7 without connecting to the power grid. When one of the old batteries finally gives out, Redwood replaces it with another one — and takes the fully spent cell inside to be torched, crumbled and dissolved into a new generation of batteries.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/A62EYPONSS3DMMRSFC52YYDGXM.jpg&w=1200,N,,2025-10-29 13:08:48.952115

As we welcome this plan for Carbon Budget 6, it is vital that government builds swiftly on this foundation and develops a credible, ambitious delivery plan for Carbon Budget 7.","Working families and businesses across the country will benefit from clean energy and climate action, as the government confirms plans to seize the opportunities of the booming clean energy economy.

The Carbon Budget and Growth Delivery Plan, published today (Wednesday 29 October) sets out how the UK will continue to reduce emissions in a way that lowers bills and secures good jobs, in line with the landmark 2008 Climate Change Act. This framework has been supported by Britain’s leading businesses, trade unions, and civil society organisations because it creates a stable environment for investment in clean energy. Since the UK introduced the Act, it has been emulated around the world with 60 other countries now adopting their own climate legislation.

The framework created by the Act has helped to secure billions in investment, and this plan sets out how the British public and businesses stand to benefit in the years ahead with economic growth, cleaner air and protecting the nation’s natural environment for current and future generations.

The UK is a global leader in decarbonisation and securing investment in clean energy industries, with the UK’s net zero sectors growing three times faster than the economy overall according to the Confederation of British Industry. The UK has reduced emissions by over 50% while growing the economy by over 80% since 1990.

This is alongside over £50 billion of private investment announced into clean energy industries since last July, with the clean energy workforce set to double to more than 800,000 people by the end of the decade.

The government is pursuing policies which deliver tangible improvements to the everyday lives of working people, harnessing clean energy technologies to cut bills and deliver warmer homes. The core of the government’s plans are:

Investing in clean energy to deliver energy security and lower bills: Wholesale gas costs for households remain 75% higher than they were during the year before Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, and are the main reason energy bills remain high. In an unstable world this leaves the UK vulnerable. The government is investing in renewable and nuclear energy to get the UK off the rollercoaster of fossil fuel prices and onto clean, homegrown power it controls, protecting the British people and building a system that can bring down bills for good.

400,000 extra jobs by 2030: The government recently announced a national plan to recruit the workers needed for the clean energy mission , with over 400,000 extra jobs by 2030. From Sizewell C in East Anglia, to wind turbine manufacturing in Hull, carbon capture in the North West and North East, and ports in Wales and Scotland.

Warmer homes: The government is upgrading homes for 5 million families through our Warm Homes Plan. This will provide support for families to switch to low carbon heating to cut their bills and have warmer homes, including with higher standards of insulation and rooftop solar. The Carbon Budget and Growth Delivery Plan does not include a boiler ban and nor will the Warm Homes Plan. Government is focused on making sure heat pumps and other low-carbon technologies are the natural consumer choice, in line with our wider approach to pursue the clean energy transition through incentives not penalties. This builds on the warm home discount which will cut bills for 6 million families this winter.

Cleaner air: The plan will help make the air cleaner across the country, leading to better health and a higher quality of life for people now and in the future, including through tree planting which helps to create more attractive, healthier and resilient places to live. From cleaner air to more affordable travel, climate action will make the British people better off. Zero Emissions Vehicles are now cheaper to run, saving drivers up to £1,500 a year in running costs compared to a petrol or diesel car.

Secretary of State, Ed Miliband, said:

Over the last 16 months we have put clean energy and climate action at the heart of our government’s agenda - because we know it is the route to making the British people better off.

This is about delivering better lives for people today - from warmer homes and cleaner air to cheaper transport and increased access to nature - as we tackle the climate and nature crises to protect our home for future generations.

It would be negligent to leave our children and grandchildren to face energy insecurity and climate breakdown. By providing clarity and certainty on how Britain will seize these opportunities, this plan will help unlock the investment we need in clean energy, jobs and growth at home. And it will strengthen our position as a climate leader so we can push others internationally to take the action needed to avoid disaster.

Minister for Climate, Katie White, said:

Our world leading Carbon Budget and Growth Delivery Plan supports good jobs now and in the future, while continuing to attract billions of pounds of investment into Britain.

Today’s plan reaffirms that clean energy is the economic opportunity of the 21st century.

As we meet our climate targets we will deliver lower bills, warmer homes, cleaner air and good jobs in the clean energy industries of the future for British people.

Rain Newton Smith, CEO of the Confederation of British Industry, said:

Clear, consistent climate laws have helped make the UK a global leader in clean energy investment and innovation. This transition is not only essential for tackling climate change - it’s a strategic economic opportunity. Businesses remain committed because they understand this transition is the backbone of a competitive, resilient economy in an uncertain world. The science hasn’t changed but the risks of inaction have. Now is the moment to turn that ambition into tangible benefits for every household and business - from lower energy bills, and cleaner air, to the creation of high-quality jobs.

But we cannot afford to slow down. Electricity prices are too high and holding back the pace of decarbonisation and investment in the UK. Tackling this requires both targeted industry support and changing how fixed energy system charges are paid for, including a serious review of policy costs on bills. Bold action will ensure that the benefits of the clean energy transition are accelerated now and felt in communities across the UK for generations to come.

Shirine Khoury-Haq, The Co-operative Group Chief Executive and co-chair of the Net Zero Council said:

Building on the significant progress that the UK continues to make in reducing its emissions, today’s announcement is another important step. It’s vital we continue to act to tackle climate change, to deliver a fairer future for generations to come.

Clear targets, policy stability and certainty are all key for businesses looking to plan and invest with confidence, and ultimately it’s businesses which drive growth and can unlock the creation of good, green jobs. Through the Net Zero Council, we’ll continue to bring together civic society, the unions, businesses and investors to work closely with the UK Government on this vital agenda, including through the development of Sector Transition Plans.

At Co-op we’ll continue to take action to make our operations and the products and services we sell more sustainable. It is one of our member-owners’ highest priorities and it is the right thing to do.

Paul Nowak, General Secretary of the TUC, said:

This climate plan includes vital commitments to invest into manufacturing supply chains and good jobs. That’s welcome news for workers in every corner of the country.

The government must now deliver the necessary funding at the Budget – that means a targeted electricity discount to bring down industrial electricity prices, as well as investment to futureproof North Sea supply chains and ports.

Friends of the Earth’s Chief Executive, Asad Rehman, said:

With extreme weather events increasingly battering the planet - just as we’re seeing in Jamaica and Cuba right now - and hitting those who’ve done least to cause the crisis hardest here and overseas, strong climate action has never been more urgent.

There are some encouraging signs that, at long last, we have a government ready to step up and get the UK’s climate targets back on track. But we won’t know for sure until we have studied the full detail of the plan.

Crucially, the government has signalled that it recognises that meaningful climate action isn’t just a legal duty – it’s a massive social and economic opportunity too. Done right, it can deliver cheaper bills, warmer homes and thousands of good green jobs. This would help to tackle the deep inequality felt across the country and build a fairer, more prosperous future.

Andy Prendergast, GMB National Secretary, said:

Delivering good jobs must be the number one mission of all governments. If this plan delivers good, secure jobs and tackles climate change, it can only be a good thing.

Further consultation on bringing down electric costs for industry is vital. Too many key manufacturing firms are struggling: a huge problem for growth and international competitiveness.

We look forward to seeing more action on this in the upcoming Budget.

Rachel Solomon Williams, Executive Director of the Aldersgate Group, said:

Economic growth must be based on decarbonisation, especially given the material risk that climate change poses to businesses and the opportunities offered by the global transition. The Climate Change Act, and the delivery plans that it requires, helps the UK to maintain its leadership position. It also offers certainty and attracts global investment to futureproof the UK economy.

We welcome the clarity provided by the new Carbon Budget and Growth Delivery Plan: it sets out a comprehensive approach to tackling emissions across all sectors, aligned with the government’s growth mission. Investor confidence will be further strengthened as more details on delivery emerge, including the upcoming Warm Homes Plan and industrial decarbonisation plan. However, the persistently high price of electricity continues to hold back growth and decarbonisation across multiple sectors, as well as putting pressure on households. We urge the government to prioritise action on power prices in the forthcoming Budget.

Sarah Boon, Managing Director, Corporate Affairs & Strategic Policy at UK Finance, said:

The UK’s transition to a low‑carbon economy is a huge opportunity to drive investment, create jobs, and secure long-term growth. Our industry is ready to play its part through lending and financing.

The government’s first investor prospectus, alongside the Carbon Budget and Growth Delivery Plan, shows real commitment to working with us. We look forward to helping shape the next steps to give businesses the certainty they need for sustainable growth.

Rachael Orr, CEO of Climate Outreach said:

This plan is right to highlight the benefits the clean energy transition can bring to people across the country. Almost three quarters of us are worried about climate change and there is a quiet sense of pride across the country that we are building the clean industries of the future. Many people feel genuine excitement about climate policy when it’s seen as an investment in something tangible which benefits their homes, communities and our natural world.

To deliver the ambitions in this plan, we have to ensure we engage people and communities on decisions that will affect them and work together to strengthen our communities, improve our daily lives, and secure a better future for everyone.

Miles Celic OBE, CEO of TheCityUK, said:

The publication of the Carbon Budget Delivery and Growth Plan (CBDGP), and the inclusion of the Investor Prospectus particularly, marks a positive step forward in providing industry with clarity on the UK’s net zero policy landscape and the government support available.

We look forward to seeing the more detailed materials that the government plans to release in the coming months to further support investor decision-making. The net zero transition represents a major growth opportunity for the UK, and the UK-based financial and related professional services industry stands ready to play a vital enabling role in this journey.

Minnie Moll, CEO of the Design Council, said:

Net zero is not just a goal, it is an opportunity to redesign the world we want to live in, driving innovation, delivering growth, and creating a healthier future for all.

We fully support the government’s stance that green growth and economic growth go hand in hand and are delighted that design has been recognised as a key clean energy job, a vital acknowledgment of the sector’s role in driving innovation for the green economy. This recognition aligns with our mission to upskill one million designers in green design skills by 2030, ensuring the UK design industry leads the way in the green transition.

Ian Simm, CEO of Impax Asset Management said:

As an investor focused on the transition to a more sustainable economy, Impax Asset Management welcomes the ambition and clarity of the UK’s Carbon Budget and Growth Delivery Plan.

By prioritising practical benefits – lower bills, good jobs, warmer homes and cleaner air – it makes a compelling case for accelerated climate action underpinning much-needed economic growth. I applaud the Secretary of State for outlining a clear path forward and look forward to continuing our work through the Net Zero Council to help unlock the investment needed to deliver it.

Beverley Cornaby, Director, UK Corporate Leaders Group, said:

Today’s Carbon Budget and Growth Delivery Plan rightly recognises that tackling climate change and supporting economic growth have gone, and continue to go, hand in hand. Investing in clean energy, improving home efficiency, and accelerating the transition away from fossil fuels are essential to reducing costs for households and businesses alike.

Business leaders across the UK know that delivering on our climate goals is also an opportunity to drive innovation, unlock investment, and build resilience in the face of volatile global energy prices. It simply makes good business sense.

As we welcome this plan for Carbon Budget 6, it is vital that government builds swiftly on this foundation and develops a credible, ambitious delivery plan for Carbon Budget 7. Long-term clarity and consistency are key to maintaining business confidence, attracting private capital, and ensuring the UK remains a leader in the global clean economy.

Chris Cummings, Chief Executive of the Investment Association, said:

The publication, for the first time, of an investor prospectus alongside the government’s Carbon Budget and Growth Delivery Plan indicates that the UK is thinking seriously about making decarbonisation a growth opportunity.

This is an important step in establishing dialogue between potential investors and government to build confidence on policy direction, involve investors at an early stage in project development, and build capacity in government to engage constructively with investors at every stage of the capital cycle from start-up to major infrastructure project.

Matthew Evans, COO and Director of Markets at techUK, said:

The new plan shows climate action is good for growth and great for businesses. With digital solutions integral to delivering progress, jobs, and with the potential to cut global emissions by 20%, techUK is looking forward to working with government to achieve this ambitious plan.

Notes to editors

1. The Carbon Budget and Growth Delivery Plan brings together the actions being taken across government to meet carbon budgets 4-6, from 2023-2037

2. Carbon budgets are 5-year caps on greenhouse gas emissions levels set under the Climate Change Act 2008.

3. Following a successful legal challenge under the previous government, the High Court ordered the government to publish a new report setting out its plans to meet future carbon budgets.

4. We are now presenting a new plan which builds on our action to accelerate clean, homegrown energy for the British people.

5. This includes making planning decisions equivalent to powering 7.5 million homes, attracting over £50 billion in private sector investment announcements, setting up publicly owned Great British Energy, sparking a new golden age of nuclear power, and bringing in new plans to upgrade millions of homes to cut bills for homeowners and renters.

6. The government has also refined our analytical approach to better reflect how emissions savings will arise across the economy and within the policy package.

7. These changes ensure that the plan clearly sets out why the Secretary of State has confidence that it will enable Carbon Budgets to be met.

8. The overall emissions reduction targets set under the previous government have not changed.

Trabish,,,,,https://www.utilitydive.com/news/in-an-era-of-rising-rates-policies-to-strengthen-power-system-flexibility/803935/,"State policymakers and stakeholders can design and enact those incentives and other policies to strengthen power system flexibility, affordability and reliability, analysts said.
Using flexibility to reduce new large load demand peaks spreads utilities’ increased sales across times when infrastructure and supply are adequate, Borenstein said.
And the aggregated DER and VPPs that can shift distribution demand peaks are growing, aSeptember Wood Mackenzie study showed.
Shifting significant load away from peak demand periods reduces both new distribution system infrastructure and system maintenance costs, former Commissioner Thomas stressed.
Regulators around the country are increasingly being asked to recognize the value of demand flexibility at all levels of the system.","Rising ratepayer burdens from costs to meet new large loads from hyperscalers and other load growth can be limited by utilities that use newly available flexibility to manage demand peaks, power system stakeholders told Utility Dive.

Due to growing demand for power from data centers and industrial customers, total U.S. generation by the electric power sector will grow by 2.3% in 2025, according toSeptember data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. And the average U.S. residential electricity rate rose over 5% from July 2024 to July 2025, EIA’sdata browser showed.

Investing in an expanded power system to meet new large load demand and limiting rate impacts while paying for the investments may seem contradictory, but it can be done, stakeholders said.

Large loads increase rates if they induce utilities to make expensive grid infrastructure upgrades to meet higher demand peaks, said University of California, Berkeley, Haas School of Business Professor Severin Borenstein.

But with policy incentives to “restrain” peak demand, large loads can avoid the costs that drive higher rates, he added.

State policymakers and stakeholders can design and enact those incentives and other policies to strengthen power system flexibility, affordability and reliability, analysts said.

“Rate increases are capturing politicians’ attention because costs, and especially energy costs, are emerging consumer issues,” said former Arkansas Public Service Commission Chair Ted Thomas, founder of Energize Strategies. “That makes resisting rate increases important enough for politicians to expend political capital on now.”

Though the amount of load growth is still uncertain, investments to meet it already threaten affordability. But data shows the right regulation can limit its impacts and potentially stabilize customer costs.

The rising prices

Investor-owned utilities, which meet 57% of U.S. electricity use, will invest of about $1.1 trillion from 2025 to 2029 in infrastructure, up from $765 billion in the previous five years, according to a September Edison Electric Institute report. There are 91 GW of new capacity under construction, and 488 GW planned or proposed, it found.

The data center electricity demand has created “a new category of costs” for expanding and modernizing the system that threatens “bills for all customers,” observeda September Union of Concerned Scientists policy brief. Regulatory practices at the state level “allow for this — the worst — outcome” of growth, it added.

But new policies that encourage growing large loads like data centers to be flexible and shift usage away from demand peaks can improve outcomes, stakeholders said.

Large load flexibility

Large loads can increase rates because system operators and utilities must make capital expenditures, or CapEx, for infrastructure to meet demand peaks, Haas Institute’s Borenstein said. Those peaks are 50 hours or fewer per year but the infrastructure costs for meeting them go into and drive up customer rates, he added.

The most important way to prevent the rate increases is for large loads and system operators to use demand flexibility to manage those infrequent new peaks, Borenstein said. Interconnecting new data centers and large loads “could be contingent on flexing their demand during those peak hours,” he added.

Using flexibility to reduce new large load demand peaks spreads utilities’ increased sales across times when infrastructure and supply are adequate, Borenstein said. Even with some distribution system investment, “rates don’t meaningfully increase, he said.

Using “flexible demand strategies,” U.S. power systems can meet over 98 GW of new demand from data centers and other large loads, according to a paper from Duke University’s Nicholas Institute. “Only a 0.5% annual curtailment” during demand peaks is needed, it added.

Greater flexibility “could transform data centers from passive customers to grid assets” to improve reliability, lower costs, and speed connection, agreed anAugust 31 analysis from the Electric Power Research Institute. Using purpose-designed NVIDIA chips, an Arizona pilot in May led by software designer Emerald AI verified data center flexibility’s potential.

Using only generation to meet infrequent peak demand spikes could also drive up investment in “rarely-used capacity” to meet resource adequacy standards, said Mike Hogan, senior advisor and consultant with the Regulatory Assistance Project. It is instead “more valuable than ever” to take advantage of low-cost demand-side options, he added.

Regulators can also imposelarge load tariffs with contractual commitments that ensure the new demand is paid for by those who cause it, said former Commissioner Thomas.

Policymakers want to both support economic development and protect consumers from rising electricity costs, Thomas said. Some “will be betting their next election on the decisions they face,” he added.

Distributed generation’s flexibility

Use of flexible distributed energy resources, or DER, aggregated in virtual power plants, or VPPs, is growing significantly, analysts, utilities and other stakeholders said.

Shifting distribution system peaks would likely have the most impact on customer costs because 44% of utility CapEx goes to distribution system spending,a 2024 Lawrence Berkeley National Lab study found. And the aggregated DER and VPPs that can shift distribution demand peaks are growing, aSeptember Wood Mackenzie study showed.

“The VPP market grew over 33% from 2024 to 2025” and aggregators monetized “433 utility and market programs, a 35% increase over last year,” Wood Mackenzie reported.

In Illinois, Commonwealth Edison, or ComEd, proposed a “bring your own device load reduction program” to “take advantage of customers’ energy storage resources,” said Scott Vogt, the utility’s vice president of strategy, energy policy and revenue initiatives. CapEx for the program will be “minimal” and it will begin with competitive bidding by DER aggregators, he added.

The aggregators would receive signals to reduce electricity usage during peak times and the goal is to get at least 10 GWs of the 47 GW of DER in ComEd’s territory enrolled, Vogt said. There is compensation for DER aggregators and owners, but for the utility and its non-DER owning customers, “the value is in reducing the demand curve,” he added.

Shifting significant load away from peak demand periods reduces both new distribution system infrastructure and system maintenance costs, former Commissioner Thomas stressed.

Regulators around the country are increasingly being asked to recognize the value of demand flexibility at all levels of the system.

Regulations to scale demand flexibility

Current regulatory processes and requirements have utilities “boxed in” and not using forward-looking “outside-the-box thinking,” said Association of Edison Illuminating Utilities Vice President Elizabeth Cook. To meet today’s load growth, utilities need to advance their analytics and “practically reinvent the way they see their systems,” she added.

“Hyperscalers need to readjust their attitude to utilities, too, even though they canbuy the utilities they are working with,” Cook continued.

Read More in Load Management, Efficiency & Demand Response

In the last three years, 30 states have designed 49 newly approved or proposed large-load tariffs for 44 investor-owned and public power utilities and cooperatives, according to the DELTa database from the North Carolina Clean Energy Technology Center and the Smart Electric Power Alliance, of SEPA.

There is “a substantial effort to balance the many objectives at play — energy affordability, economic development, reliability, and clean energy,” said Ann Collier, SEPA’s senior manager of emerging technologies.

Provisions in the new tariffs may include requirements to curtail during extreme demand peaks, build onsite generation or storage, or make long-term contractual commitments to cover infrastructure costs.

Scaling demand flexibility can lower costs and make participation easier, but regulatory processes create too much friction for residential customers, said Josh Keeling, chief commercial officer for UtilityAPI, which helps utilities aggregate and use DERs.

Few utilities make the customer-level data needed to integrate VPPs easily accessible, Keeling said. But initiatives likeEPRI’s Open Power AI are developing ways to share data and protect data security, he added.

Utilities likeEversource,Pacific Gas & Electric andConsolidated Edison, and their regulators, have streamlined data access, Keeling said.Maryland,New Jersey,Illinois andNew Hampshire are following successful work done by New York,California, andTexas on data access, he added.

For demand flexibility to have the most impact, program designs must include meaningful compensation and be clearly understood by customers who enroll, said Schneider Electric Senior Vice President and Chief Technology Officer Scott Harden. And program assets must be dispatchable, he said.

The new load growth will give regulators reasons to resolve utilities’ traditional biases against expensing software technologies for distribution system management, Harden added.

Regulators could formalize the use of aggregated DERs to reduce demand peaks and the costs they impose throughdistributed capacity procurements, or DCPs, said Sparkfund Vice President Brendan Reed. The DCP would be considered as part of the utility planning process along with other peak capacity resources for cost recovery, he added.

An alternate metric is data from trandomized control trials, said Renew Home Director of Market Innovation Will Baker. Randomized control trial data can approximate the value of avoided transmission and distribution costs, ancillary services and energy, he added.

State policymakers could impose mandates on utilities to reduce a percent of their overall peak loads through load flexibility programs, said Hannah Bascom, chief growth officer for DER aggregator Uplight.

But even without a mandate, utilities facing load growth are beginning to see flexibility as the most prudent investment to protect affordability and reliability, Bascom added.

Flexibility as prudence

Failing to adequately consider flexibility in utility planning and rate cases violatesbasic prudence and reasonability principles of electricity regulation, several stakeholders said.

Publicly available standardized data in utility planning and rate cases is more important with demand growing, said Mark LeBel, principal for research and strategy at the Regulatory Assistance Project.

A regulatory decision approving a utility’s rate case investment proposals but lacking adequate justifying information is not prudent, he added.

For a proposed rate case investment to be reasonable and prudent, the utility must make abusiness case that addresses its need, value and accountability to customers, according to Commissioner Abigail Anthony of the Rhode Island Public Utilities Commission.

A utility may argue its regulators’ requirements are impeding vital modernization, but it has to show the modernization investment has net value to ratepayers, Anthony said.

It is especially important to show the value of new investments while significant uncertainty remains about how much load growth is coming, Anthony and others said.

But whatever the coming load growth, “in this world of computational power, utilities need hyperscalers to create AI analytics and hyperscalers need utilities to deliver electricity,” Edison Illuminating Companies’ Cook said. “Regulation that leads to collaboration could be a complete win-win that strengthens overall reliability and affordability.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/eW89R5lJ_TOSx3sYtZr6_9z-aPypZ1yRLRlfHQtuWyU/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9kYXRhX2NlbnRlcl9WZXJub25fQ2FsaWZvcm5pYS5qcGc=.webp,N,,2025-10-29 13:09:32.155813

A constitutional amendment that would prohibit members of Congress from receiving a salary during a shutdown was introduced this fall.","As the government shutdown nears the one-month mark, and nearly 2 million Illinoisans are on track to lose their federal food benefits Saturday, a recent move by a suburban congressman is well worth noting.

Democratic U.S. Rep. Bill Foster of Naperville announced he’ll donate the congressional pay he receives during the shutdown to the Northern Illinois Food Bank. He did the same during previous shutdowns in 2013 and 2019. Other suburban members of Congress have made similar moves in the past.

It’s a generous and laudable decision, and the Geneva-based food bank is a worthy cause. But Foster’s announcement brings to mind a bigger question: Why are members of Congress and President Donald Trump — the ones responsible for the shutdown — drawing paychecks while their aides and more than a million other federal workers do not?

The answer lies in the Constitution, but the unfairness of it still rankles.

Article I, Section 6 of the Constitution states: “The Senators and Representatives shall receive a Compensation for their Services, to be ascertained by Law, and paid out of the Treasury of the United States.” The president’s pay is also guaranteed.

Federal workers, meanwhile, do without. The Bipartisan Policy Center says at least 670,000 federal employees are furloughed and another 730,000 must work without pay.

Members of the military are also required to serve, and their pay could end Friday when a temporary solution runs out.

If there’s no movement in Congress to end this mess in the next few days, the current shutdown will earn the dubious distinction of being the longest in U.S. history. The current record-holder lasted 35 days, stretching from late 2018 into 2019 during the first Trump administration.

For politicians, shutdowns produce killer sound bites. But the financial brinkmanship hurts Americans and sets the stage for a predictable show of Democrats blaming Republicans and Republicans blaming Democrats.

In a release about his decision to donate his pay, Foster blasted Republicans. House Speaker Mike Johnson, meanwhile, did the same to Democrats.

“Day 27 means it's almost been a full month since the Democrats shut down the government,” Johnson said Monday at his daily news conference at the Capitol.

Since then, Day 27 turned into Day 28 — and then 29 — in a march toward a shameful new shutdown record.

Perhaps if our elected leaders lost their paychecks for more than a month, they’d have more incentive to come to the table, to talk, to compromise.

Perhaps not.

But when this crisis passes, they should take on the issue.

A constitutional amendment that would prohibit members of Congress from receiving a salary during a shutdown was introduced this fall. If passed, it could only take effect after the next election.

Doing so, of course, would be challenging given the amendment process, and previous proposals have gone nowhere. Still, elected officials ought to give the proposal serious consideration — or be prepared to explain to voters why they haven’t.

Until then, we hope others follow Foster’s example.",https://foster.house.gov/profiles/evo/assets/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-10-29 16:06:34.608741

Occidental Petroleum is an exceptionally efficient oil and gas producer.

The company is also a leader in carbon capture and storage, a promising technology.

However, Oxy's future still hinges largely on volatile oil prices.

10 stocks we like better than Occidental Petroleum ›

What's the most important geographical hub for energy companies? It's Texas. The Lone Star State is home to many of the world's biggest oil and gas producers, pipeline operators, and more.

If you wanted to narrow the map even further, look around Houston, Texas. Several energy leaders are headquartered in the metropolitan area, including Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY). No, Oxy doesn't boast the largest market cap among its peers. But is this Texas-based company a no-brainer buy for energy investors?

Oxy's big pluses

Warren Buffett is arguably one of the best people to consult if you're looking for reasons to consider buying shares of Occidental Petroleum. He has led Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) in building a 27% stake in the oil company. Berkshire also owns warrants that allow it to add to that position.

Buffett wrote to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders last year that Occidental is one of only a handful of stocks that he expects the conglomerate to ""maintain indefinitely."" The legendary investor stated, ""We particularly like its vast oil and gas holdings in the United States.""

Oxy gets a lot of bang for the buck from those oil and gas assets, too. As a case in point, the company's average six-month cumulative oil production in the Delaware Basin was 45% higher than the average operator.

While Buffett focused on Occidental's importance to U.S. energy production, the company has significant operations outside the country as well. In May, Oxy signed a 15-year contract extension with Oman that will allow it to increase production in the Middle Eastern country.

A lottery ticket thrown in

In his letter to Berkshire shareholders, Buffett also highlighted Occidental Petroleum's pioneering work in carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology. He acknowledged, though, that ""the economic feasibility of this technique has yet to be proven.""

Buffett was right about Occidental's leadership in CCS. The company's Carbon Engineering subsidiary is at the forefront of direct air capture (DAC) technology that literally sucks carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Its 1PointFive subsidiary is developing ways to use Carbon Engineering's DAC technology at industrial scale.

Oxy's Stratos DAC facility in the Midland-Odessa area of Texas is slated to begin operations by the end of this year. It will be able to extract roughly 500,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide from the air at full capacity. This carbon dioxide will then either be stored underground or used in enhanced oil recovery. Several major corporations have already purchased carbon credits that will be generated by Stratos, including Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), AT&T (NYSE: T), and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT).

CCS is almost like a lottery ticket thrown in with the deal when you invest in Occidental. If the technology fulfills its potential, the company could have a huge new source of revenue. It could also help alleviate many of the climate concerns associated with oil and gas production.

No-brainer buy?

Does all of this make Occidental Petroleum stock a no-brainer buy? Not necessarily.

The company's fortunes still largely depend on oil prices. In early 2024, Occidental CEO Vicki Hollub predicted a supply shortage in the oil market by the end of 2025. She has since backpedaled from that position somewhat but still thinks that oil prices will rise beyond 2026.

Hollub said in the company's second-quarterearnings call ""We believe that carbon capture and DAC, in particular, will be instrumental in shaping the future energy landscape."" It remains to be seen if she will be proven right.

Last, but not least, Occidental isn't the cheapest oil stock on the market. Its forward price-to-earnings ratio is higher than several of its peers, including two fellow companies in the Houston area -- ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM) and ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP).

When all factors are considered, I don't think Occidental stock is a no-brainer buy right now. However, I think the odds are more in its favor than against it. This Texas-based stock could be a winner for investors over the long run.

The 11-month rehabilitation of Kimberly Ridge Apartments included updating kitchens, bathrooms, and lighting fixtures, and installing energy-efficient heating and cooling systems in all units. The team also replaced roofs and repaired siding, gutters, and parking surfaces.

Six apartments were modified to meet accessibility standards for the mobility impaired, and seven market-rate units were converted to affordable housing.

“This property offers one-, two-, three-, and four-bedroom apartments, making it a vital source of large family units for a range of households needing affordable homes in the rapidly growing suburbs around Charlotte,” said Matthew Kassel, senior director of development for LEDG Capital. “We are grateful for the opportunity to partner with the North Carolina Housing Finance Agency (NCHFA) to preserve and improve the community for decades to come.”

The effort was supported by a new 20-year Housing Assistance Program contract and low-income housing tax credits (LIHTCs), ensuring that all units are available to households earning up to 60% of the area median income.

“The successful renovation of this property serves as a model of what can happen when affordable homes are preserved,” said Scott Farmer, executive director of NCHFA, which provided the LIHTCs. “The agency is proud to be involved with this project to ensure these apartments remain safe and affordable places for residents to call home.”

CREA was the housing tax credit syndicator, and Merchants Capital served as the lender.

It is one of the most ambitious plans in U.S. atomic energy in decades, underscoring President Donald Trump’s agenda to maximize energy output, focused on oil, gas, coal and nuclear.

It also comes as growth in artificial intelligence data centers boosts U.S. power demand for the first time in two decades, straining parts of the grid.

Under the agreement with Westinghouse Electric’s owners, Canada-based Cameco and Brookfield Asset Management the U.S. government will arrange financing and help secure permits for the Westinghouse reactors.

In return, the plan offers the U.S. government a 20 percent share of future profits after Westinghouse has paid out profits of $17.5 billion to Brookfield and Cameco. The U.S. government could turn that profit into an equity stake of up to 20 percent and require an initial public offering of Westinghouse by 2029 if its value surpasses $30 billion, the companies said.

The plan was announced after Trump, who is on a trip to Asia, said in Tokyo that Japan will provide up to $332 billion to support infrastructure in the U.S., including construction of Westinghouse AP1000 reactors and small modular reactors.

Japanese firms Mitsubishi Heavy Industries could be involved in building up to $100 billion of Westinghouse reactors, according to a fact sheet issued by the two countries on the trade deal on Tuesday.

The companies did not say when the U.S. government interest would vest, but added that the government must make a final investment decision and enter agreements to complete construction of the plants.

It remains uncertain if the deal will succeed. Building new U.S. nuclear reactors and a permanent place to deposit the waste has been difficult due to soaring costs as well as public concern about potential accidents.

The last two Westinghouse U.S. reactors built at the Vogtle site in Georgia in 2023 and 2024 were about seven years behind schedule and cost around $35 billion, more than double an original estimate of $14 billion.

Westinghouse filed for bankruptcy in 2017 due to cost overruns, and was later acquired by Brookfield. Brookfield owns 51 percent of Westinghouse, while Cameco holds the rest.

No large reactors are currently under construction in the United States.

The Trump administration in May ordered the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission to slash regulations and fast-track new licenses for reactors, seeking to shrink a multi-year process down to 18 months. The order called for 10 new large reactors under construction by 2030.

The administration also reviewed staffing levels at the independent agency, which led some critics to question whether permits would be rushed at a risk to safety.

The NRC said it would respond to a request for comment about the deal once it has returned to full operations after the government reopens. U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a statement that Trump had promised a nuclear power renaissance “and now he is delivering.”

Critics also point to the fact that radioactive waste, which remains dangerous for thousands of years, is currently kept on site at nuclear plants in cooling pools and then moved into hard casks.

Still, momentum around nuclear is being driven by surging power demand from the so-called hyperscalers that operate massive cloud-computing infrastructure to manage rising artificial intelligence processing.

NextEra Energy and Alphabet’s Google stuck a deal to restart an idle nuclear plant in Iowa.

Tech giants including Google, Microsoft and Amazon have already inked deals to source power from next-generation nuclear technologies, such as fusion and small modular reactors.

Constellation Energy and Microsoft have partnered to revive a unit of the Three Mile Island plant in Pennsylvania to power Microsoft’s data centers.

Ohio’s Cuyahoga River, which flows into Lake Erie, was so polluted with toxic chemicals dumped from nearby industrial plants that it caught on fire in 1969. Shortly thereafter, the oil-fouled Rouge River in Detroit also caught fire. Those events prompted the creation of one of the nation’s greatest federal institutions — the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Decades of bipartisan policies and regulations were passed, giving Americans certainty that the water they drank and swam in and the air they breathed would be cleaner than in previous generations and protected for generations to come.

Now, the Trump administration is in full swing of dismantling key policies of the EPA. It has put the gears of environmental policy in reverse, stepped on the carbon-emitting gas pedal, and is accelerating the nation backward at warp speed to the alarm of environmental experts and public health officials.

The rollbacks and deregulations occurring are too numerous to document, from deregulating the responsibility of greenhouse gas-belching industries to track emissions, incentivizing and ordering coal-fired electric power plants to stay open, easing restrictions for polluting industries and neutering or eliminating government reporting on environmental conditions. The EPA and the Trump administration rationalize that these deregulations are necessary to usher in “The Great American Comeback” for American businesses, industries and manufacturing.

This drastic U-turn — from generating decades of policies and funding to encourage the research and development of cleaner energy and products that slow the acceleration of climate change to unraveling it all in less than a year — is causing chaos and disruption in industries and businesses across the board.

Michigan’s vital automotive industry was already well on the way to long-term strategic plans with greener practices, such as developing automobiles that run on cleaner energy like electricity, batteries or hydrogen fuel cells. Energy companies building their wind and solar portfolios to supply the grid with electricity have witnessed the elimination of funding for wind and solar research and development incentives.

From a funding and personnel standpoint, environmental watchdogs lament that the EPA has been gutted. Decades of policy precedents to preserve and improve our air, land and water at the EPA are on the chopping block. This includes setting emission limits for legacy polluters and encouraging the continuation of the use of coal, gas and oil to produce electricity.

The Environmental Data and Governance Initiative, a group of volunteer academics, reported that beginning in September, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin fired one out of every three full-time employees at the agency. The cuts were facilitated by executive orders such as the creation of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and circumvented any discussion in Congress as to how these cuts and layoffs would impact the environment, public health and government transparency.

In May, Zeldin’s budget proposal for the fiscal year beginning in October 2025 included cutting 1,274 full-time-equivalent employee positions from a total of 14,130 in the year ending September 30, 2025. That is a nine percent reduction.

In July, the EPA announced it had already cut 3,707 of 16,155 employees, 23 percent of its personnel. Conservatively, the Environmental Data and Governance Initiative estimates that the agency’s workforce has now been cut by one quarter. This does not include anticipated cuts to two-thirds of the EPA’s researchers.

Ultimately, by January 2026, the workforce at the EPA will be whittled down to under 10,000.

To accelerate the “Great American Comeback” for industry and manufacturing, the EPA in September scrapped its requirements for thousands of coal-burning power plants, oil refineries and steel mills to report the amount of greenhouse gases they release into the air. This data collection has been a key tool for tracking carbon dioxide, methane and other climate-changing gases since 2010 through the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program. According to the EPA, the compliance savings to businesses from this deregulation would amount to $2.4 billion over the next decade. In another move related to the mercury-emitting coal industry, the EPA also defended its decision to repeal the Biden Administration’s 2024 Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS) technology review.

In a statement emailed to Downtown regarding the EPA’s decisions to repeal several longstanding policies, the agency said the proposed repeal of the 2024 MATS Amendments would save $1.2 billion in regulatory costs over a decade, or about $120 million a year. The EPA maintains that the original 2012 MATS requirement will remain in effect.

“The 2012 MATS rule for coal plants provided an ample margin of safety to protect public health, which we retained in the Trump EPA’s proposal,” stated the EPA. “The 2012 MATS has driven sharp reductions in harmful air toxic pollutants from coal- and oil-fired power plants.”

Backing up this statement, the EPA said that industry-reported emissions show that 2021 mercury emissions from coal-fired plants were 90 percent lower than pre-MATS levels. Since 2010, emissions that caused harmful acid rain that plagued the nation in the 1970s and 1980s have been reduced by over 96 percent, and emissions of the non-mercury metals — including nickel, arsenic and lead — have been reduced by more than 81 percent.

Oil and gas pipeline industries are not excused from reporting emissions. Those were mandated by Congress under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. However, the EPA is proposing to allow these facilities to postpone reporting until 2034, and Congressional Republicans have delayed related methane fee requirements until the same year.

Of all the rollbacks of regulations, environmental and healthcare professionals are most concerned about the EPA’s proposal to completely rescind the landmark 2009 Endangerment Finding. They describe this policy as the keystone for establishing and creating greenhouse gas emissions regulations to stave off climate change and protect public health.

The 2009 Endangerment Finding originated from a 2007 landmark Supreme Court Ruling, Massachusetts v. EPA, which solidified the EPA’s authority under Section 202 of the Clean Air Act to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from the automotive industry that threaten public health and welfare.

It was drafted during the George H. Bush administration and codified into law in the Barack Obama administration.

According to the Institute of Policy Integrity at the NYU School of Law, the EPA crafted the policy from a vast body of peer-reviewed science and thousands of public comments proving that greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles harm public health.

Since its enactment in 2010, it has catalyzed the creation of many standards for greenhouse gas emissions reduction for vehicles ranging from sedans all the way through industrial trucks and heavy-duty vehicles.

By eliminating this landmark policy, the Trump administration has proposed to slash 15 years of environmental progress in one fell swoop.

The Trump administration’s proposal to overturn the Endangerment Finding also coincides with broad cancellations of research grants that would have studied the health effects of heat and air pollution. It defies a June 2025 EPA analysis, which found that the proposed repeal of carbon dioxide limits would result in a public health cost of $130 billion. That figure includes premature deaths, lost workdays and hospitalizations for things like lung and heart diseases or asthma caused by exposure to power plant pollution.

Standing before executives at a big truck manufacturing plant in Indiana, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin in July proposed “the most comprehensive rolling back of environmental emissions stringencies in American history” as he proposed to unravel the 2009 Endangerment Finding because he claimed it was a gross distortion of Section 202 of the Clean Air Act.

“We want to hear from the American public to finalize a regulation that not only proposes to rescind the Endangerment Finding, but all greenhouse gas emissions regulations that followed it on light, medium and heavy-duty vehicles,” Zeldin said. “The EPA (of the past) made many mental leaps in its creative interpretation of Section 202 of the Clean Air Act. That resulted in trillions of dollars of regulations (on vehicles and stationary sources of gas emissions).”

Remarks at this press conference drew the ire of healthcare, policy and environmental officials who argue that the reversals are not based on science or law but about giving kickbacks to the fossil fuel and big trucking industries, which financed Trump’s 2024 presidential campaign.

The EPA gave its reasons for wanting to rescind the 2009 Endangerment Finding: “The Endangerment Finding is the legal prerequisite used by the Obama and Biden Administrations to regulate emissions from new motor vehicles and new motor vehicle engines. Absent this finding, EPA would lack statutory authority under Section 202(a) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) to prescribe standards for greenhouse gas emissions.”

The EPA maintained that since the 2009 Endangerment Finding was issued, “The American people and auto manufacturing have suffered from significant uncertainties and massive costs related to general regulations of greenhouse gases from vehicles and trucks.”

By rolling back the 2009 Endangerment Finding, the EPA said it is proposing to provide much-needed certainty and regulatory relief, so companies can plan appropriately, and the American people can have affordable choices when deciding to buy a car.

“The Endangerment Finding only relates to greenhouse emissions from motor vehicles and does not relate to any traditional air pollution, and those standards would remain in effect if this decision is finalized,” stated the EPA.

“Additionally, regulations from the previous administration imposed massive costs on coal, oil, and gas-fired power plants, raising the cost of living for American families, imperiling the reliability of our electric grid, and limiting American energy prosperity,” stated the EPA. “While accomplishing EPA’s core mission of protecting human health and the environment, the Trump EPA is committed to fulfilling President Trump’s promise to unleash American energy, lower costs for Americans, revitalize the American auto industry, restore the rule of law, and give power back to states to make their own decisions.”

Pulmonologists across the country are sounding off and raising the alarm bells at the proposed reversal of policies designed to keep the air cleaner and slow climate change.

Dr. Alexander Rabin, a pulmonologist and professor at the University of Michigan, shifted his focus to climate change and air quality advocacy after noticing impacts on lung health during the Trump administration’s environmental policy changes. His work now centers on promoting clean air policies.

“I work mainly with veterans who receive care from the Veterans Administration,” Rabin said in an interview with Downtown as he drove from Ann Arbor to Troy on his way to give a talk to a group of occupational health doctors. “With no exaggeration, I am hearing complaints about breathing issues from all my patients, and my colleagues across the country are hearing it too. Especially the ones who have long-standing diseases such as COPD. They experience elevated breathing issues all summer. They tell me they cannot breathe because the air and the smoke are so bad.”

Rabin does as best he can to advise patients when breathing conditions get tough: watch out for air quality alerts, invest in indoor air filtration systems and limit outdoor activity.

“The clinical realities of today are very worrisome,” Rabin said. “The Trump administration is taking a sledgehammer to virtually all the important air quality regulations that have been put in place over the last 50 years, since the EPA came into being, and that includes the Clean Air Act. The call to rescind the 2009 Endangerment Finding is the one that really sends a chill down my spine.”

Out on the West Coast, Erika Maria Mosesón is a pulmonologist in Portland, Oregon. She serves on the American Environmental Health Policy Committee of the International Thoracic Society, comprised of 30,000 respiratory health professionals across the globe. She also produces the podcast Air Health Our Health, where she discusses her observations on how air quality events impact those suffering from chronic lung diseases such as asthma and COPD, and young children.

As a clinician, she makes rounds in hospital intensive care units and sees an uptick in patient loads during wildfire smoke and heat dome events. Mosesón said that rollbacks in environmental emissions standards, coupled with the Trump administration’s cutbacks in healthcare spending for the most vulnerable populations are “suicidal” in terms of the outlook for public health.

“Most people want themselves and their kids to be healthy and breathe clean air, though they may disagree from a policy standpoint on how we get there,” said the mother of three. “But the approach this administration is taking regarding emissions is ‘we don’t want to measure it, and we don’t want to acknowledge it, and we don’t want to study it.”

In addition to the proposal for rolling back the 2009 Endangerment finding, Mosesón is concerned about the possibility of rolling back the National Ambient Air Quality Standards rule.

In February 2024, the EPA strengthened the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for Particulate Matter to protect millions of Americans from harmful and costly health impacts, such as heart attacks and premature death. But in March, Zeldin announced the EPA is revisiting the Biden PM2.5 National Ambient Air Quality Standards to ease barriers for industrial permitting.

Mosesón explained: “PM 2.5 particulate matter is this tiny air pollutant that is a fraction of the width of a human hair. It is the main particulate that comes from wildfire smoke. It is dangerous to inhale because it is so tiny that it can slip through cell walls, enter the bloodstream, and cause the potential for disease in every organ as it circulates through the body. It can cause cardiovascular disease, strokes, and harm to growing children who are growing up in areas notoriously polluted. We were making such headway with EPA policies, and now we are at risk of losing all that.”

She continued: “Wildfire smoke events can be perceived as one-off finite events, but they are becoming more commonplace. So, if you lift restrictions on pollution emitters on top of the increase of wildfire smoke events, you are going to have the public breathing unhealthy air all the time.”

Ultimately, Mosesón said healthcare professionals must speak up about what they are observing in their patients and how their health is being affected by the environment. “I think as a general rule, doctors are scientists and feel they cannot speak to an issue unless they are thoroughly knowledgeable in all the nuances of a topic. But everyone, especially healthcare professionals, should be speaking up and telling the government that we can all benefit from safer, cleaner air and water.”

Despite all the cuts, the EPA describes its strategy as one of streamlining the agency to maintain levels of sustaining the environment while easing restrictions and regulations to make it easier to create paths of prosperity for the manufacturing and energy sectors of the economy.

In the statement emailed to Downtown, the EPA said that the EPA under the Trump administration is working to advance its core mission of protecting human health and the environment while “Powering the Great American Comeback” initiative.

“This includes ensuring that ALL American has access to clean air, water, and land regardless of regardless of race, gender, creed, or background,” read the statement. “Likewise, EPA is bound by laws established by Congress — not what some would like the law to say — including the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act.”

Mike Shriberg is director of the University of Michigan Water Center at the university’s School for Environment and Sustainability (SEAS). Reflecting on the period since Trump was inaugurated for the second time, he said the EPA cuts have decimated the ability of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) Great Lakes Environmental Lab (GREL) to efficiently monitor the Great Lakes for contaminants such as harmful algal blooms that impact the health of the water for drinking, fishing and recreational purposes. In the most acute example, a harmful algal bloom in Lake Erie in 2014 left 500,000 residents of the city of Toledo without clean tap water for two weeks.

Since 1974, GREL has conducted vital chemical, physical and biological research on the Great Lakes. It provides data on the state of the Great Lakes to water managers and policy makers for the eight Great Lakes states. With collected data, lab researchers develop computer models to predict conditions such as waves, water levels, currents, ice cover, oil spills, and harmful algal bloom movement. All this information is made available to the public and policymakers to prepare for events such as storms and changes in water quality.

The federal cuts have stripped away much of the lab’s research and forecasting abilities, Shriberg lamented.

“Up until recently, I spent half of my time working at the NOAA lab, as it funded many programs and research on the Great Lakes,” explained Shriberg. “Now, we have a third fewer people working there than we did in January. And this is before even more cuts and more staff reductions, which we know are coming.”

Shriberg said because of Trump’s cuts to the lab, the Great Lakes and, therefore, the communities that rely on them as a resource,are less healthy and safe. For example, there are fewer employees to physically get out in the water and forecast harmful algal blooms or, when they occur, check on their severity.

With Trump’s cuts, Shriberg said NOAA’s capacity to monitor the waters of the Great Lakes for harmful algal blooms is stymied by 80 percent.

While there is satellite technology being developed and deployed to monitor and track harmful algal blooms from space, as Downtown reported in 2024, Shriberg said scientists still need to physically go out on the waters to take samples of the water, observe the characteristics of harmful algal blooms, and collect data from sensor-rigged buoys far from shore. Before the Trump administration, NOAA’s GREL lab maintained, tracked, and collected data from 17 buoys in Lake Erie to monitor the waters for harmful algal blooms. Now they only have the budget to run three.

“These cuts, therefore, are a direct threat to drinking water quality,” Shriberg said. “The Trump administration has degraded (the EPA’s) programs and policies and reduced the staff of the people responsible for protecting the Great Lakes so severely that the Great Lakes and the communities that live near them are more vulnerable today than they were at the beginning of the year.”

With fewer staff, GREL has less data at its fingertips to model and prepare for dangerous floods and storms, which are becoming more common with climate change.

“Locally, we have lost some of our capacity to model where a rainstorm will hit and where localized flooding will occur,” cautioned Shriberg. “Arguably, the biggest impact of climate change in this region is the sudden heavy rain and flash flooding incidents we have recently experienced. Our modeling data is receiving less attention. That means we are less likely to know when and where a major flood will hit.”

Shriberg added that the Trump administration has also burdened the remaining researchers with red tape and bureaucracy. All spending over $100,000 — a small amount for an agency such as NOAA — needs multiple sign-offs at every political level up to the Secretary of Commerce’s office. There is also added red tape and threats to longstanding international agreements, such as the Great Lakes Compact. Ultimately, all of these drawbacks will result in less safe and dirtier water in the Great Lakes, Shriberg said.

If there is one silver lining for the Great Lakes, Shriberg said, it is that Trump reversed his decision to restore already congressionally allocated funding to prevent the spread of invasive species such as the sea lamprey and the Asian Carp from encroaching into Lake Michigan. This was due to immense bipartisan political pressure.

“The two instances of restoring funding to the Great Lakes Fisheries Commission and the Army Corps of Engineers to control the invasive carp and sea lamprey from invading the Great Lakes are some of the rare circumstances I know about where the Trump administration came under fire from both sides of the aisle,” Shriberg said. “This money was already appropriated by Congress, so by law, the Trump administration was legally required to let those dollars be used. But the law has not stopped the Trump administration from the many other cuts he has done. Many of the other cuts have been carried out not through congressional approval but through executive orders.” At the campus level, Shriberg said that SEAS this year has weathered cuts in federal research grants, and the school had to pull back on internships, research fellowships and projects.

The news on funding changes from day to day, making it next to impossible to provide students with research or field work opportunities. As it stands now, the education of their students is being funded mainly through their tuition dollars, Shriberg said.

“Our students are still receiving an excellent education on campus and in the classroom,” Shriberg said. “It’s just that there is a significant decrease in opportunities for students to get research experience out in the field.”

Other strides in drinking water safety being reversed under the Trump administration include placing limits on forever chemicals, or PFAS, most commonly found in the nation’s drinking water supplies.

In April 2024, the Biden administration’s EPA, for the first time in 26 years, added new rules and regulations setting threshold limits on the six most detected forever chemicals. This ruling was modeled after Michigan’s state laws.

But in May 2025, the EPA planned to dismantle some of these advances in PFAS monitoring and measuring. It will weaken some part-per-trillion (ppt) thresholds of some of the most commonly present forever chemicals while maintaining standards set by the Biden Administration for two other common ones.

According to published reports, limits on three types of PFAS, including what are known as GenX substances found in North Carolina, will be scrapped and reconsidered by the agency, as well as a limit on a mixture of several types of PFAS.

The Biden administration’s rule also set standards for the two common types of PFAS, referred to as PFOA and PFOS, at 4 parts per trillion, effectively the lowest level at which they can be reliably detected. The EPA will keep those standards but give utilities two extra years — until 2031 — to comply.

Still, Michigan has set the bar for having the country’s toughest limits on forever chemicals in drinking water. It has set the most stringent maximum contaminant levels (MCLs) at 8 parts per trillion (ppt) for PFOA and 16 ppt for PFOS, the two most commonly present forever chemicals.

Oakland County Water Resources Commissioner Jim Nash assured that his water managers continue to use standards set by the state.

“The 22 community water systems operated by Oakland County Water Resources comply with all applicable state and federal rules,” Nash said. “My office regularly monitors and tests for PFAS contamination. Regardless of federal regulations, these monitoring programs will continue.”

In response to questions about relaxing PFAS standards at the federal level, the EPA wrote to Downtown: “The EPA is tackling PFAS from all our program offices, advancing research and testing, stopping PFAS from getting into drinking water systems, holding polluters accountable, and more. This is just a fraction of the work the agency is doing on PFAS during President Trump’s second term to ensure Americans have the cleanest air, land, and water.”

Up in Traverse City, the non-profit organization For the Love of Water (FLOW) has long focused its resources on fighting Enbridge’s Line 5 Project to transport oil from Canada to the United States in a tunnel that will run on the bottom of the Straits of Mackinaw. Right now, the case for the Michigan Public Service’s permit for Line 5 is under review by the Michigan Supreme Court.

Though the Line 5 issue is unrelated to the many cuts the Trump administration has made to environmental protection, FLOW Executive Director Liz Kirkwood is extremely concerned about other permits that are being issued that ignore the potential for environmental disasters and harm along the shores of the Great Lakes. FLOW is also working with state government officials to pass regulations for proper septic tank maintenance that threaten the health of inner lakes and tributaries, as well as the Great Lakes.

In June, FLOW filed a petition for review with the EPA’s Environmental Appeals Board that challenged the approval of underground injection control permits that would allow for the deep injection of millions of gallons of briny wastewater into wells in Osceola and Mecosta Counties. The organization, along with local advocates and residents, argued that the permitting fails to adequately protect the only groundwater resource for rural communities.

But among the grim outlook, Kirkwood said there are some silver linings.

“The good news is that our state government and judiciary are still leaning into enforcement, and that’s what is happening with the Line 5 tunnel permit challenge,” Kirkwood explained. “FLOW’s legal challenge is related to the Michigan Public Service Commission and the Court of Appeals’ failure to recognize that the agencies in Michigan have a separate and independent substantive duty to apply Michigan’s Environmental Protection Act in their permitting process.”

She continued: “The state agencies are asking two important questions. First: Is a proposed action going to harm, impair, or pollute the natural resource that is about to be changed, be it a wetland or a body of water? The second question is, are there any viable alternatives to a proposed action? This analysis is critical for agencies entrusted by the public to protect our natural resources, who are evaluating proposals from businesses to find the best path forward while protecting those natural resources.”

One natural resource Kirkwood is particularly concerned about, by relaxing permit standards are wetlands. These marshy areas that hug our shorelines of the Great and inner lakes protect water infrastructure, provide habitat for native species, protect from flooding, and filter contaminants out of surface waters.

In March of 2025, the EPA rolled back federal protections that will lead to more pollution in the Great Lakes, critics contend.

“Rolling back wetlands protection lacks common sense,” Kirkwood said. “We know that the economic benefits related to wetland preservation include shoreline erosion and flooding.”

Kirkwood said that FLOW is keeping its eye on the ramifications of the EPA’s rolling back the “Waters of the United States” rule. The EPA argued that it rolled back this ruling according to its interpretation of the 2023 Supreme Court decision on Sackett v. EPA, which ruled that “EPA’s authority extends only to wetlands with a continuous surface connection to the rivers, lakes, and streams that are protected as navigable waters.”

By doing this, environmentalists agree that the EPA has stripped away federal protections for areas prone to occasional flooding and therefore endangered ecosystems that provide habitat for wildlife, filter out pollutants, and mitigate stormwater.

“Fortunately, Michigan has the Michigan Wetlands Act,” assured Kirkwood. “After the Sackett decision came down, we know that Michigan and other states, such as Wisconsin, have some good state laws. But other states like Indiana and Ohio lack local regulations are are much more vulnerable to wetlands degradation and loss, which can come in at billions of dollars.”

In addition to erasing regulations, the Trump administration has eliminated incentives for consumer and industrial markets to adopt greener practices and create and develop energy sources and products to stave off climate change.

Bentley Johnson, federal government affairs director for the Michigan League of Conservation Voters, said his organization was concerned by moves made in the first Trump administration, but they pale in comparison with Trump 2.0.

Among his organization’s biggest concerns are easing restrictions on greenhouse gas air emissions and incentives to create cleaner vehicles within the automotive industry, as well as an about-face on phasing out the use of coal to fuel the electricity grid.

Johnson understands the importance of consistent and steady environmental policy for the automotive industry and the ramifications for Michigan’s economy. Johnson said pivoting in policies on fuel economy and creating future fleets of greener vehicles independent of fossil fuels is harmful for the environment and long-term business planning.

“Over the decades, the EPA has gone through multiple rounds of emissions and fuel economy standards for vehicles,” Johnson said. “That certainty provides the automakers with the rules of how they will strategize for the next five or 10 years in designing the best products to meet standards that would have improved air quality and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. We know that the overwhelming consensus of the scientific body of evidence is that fossil fuels are causing climate change.”

Johnson said that the Michigan League of Conservation Voters has heard from small and large businesses connected to the automotive industry that uncertainty in policy harms their bottom line.

“This whiplash effect in policy changes between administrations makes it difficult for businesses to plan, secure supply chains, and develop long-term strategies,” Johnson said. “The Trump administration is creating chaos and recklessness, and confusion. All it does is help enrich the fossil fuel friends whom Trump promised to hand out tax cuts to the ultra-wealthy, those who contributed to his reelection campaign.

Johnson also touched upon all the green-energy incentives that went away for both consumers and energy makers under what he describes as Trump’s “Big Ugly Bill,” which was passed in July and went into effect in October.

For example, Johnson said costs on electric vehicles will now rise by $7,500 after the incentive EV tax credit ended, and the average cost of a used EV is about to go up by $4,500.

Pulling back consumer incentives to make greener choices in their next vehicle purchase is only the tip of a melting iceberg of money once allocated for green grants to fight and adapt to climate change.

On October 1, the White House canceled $8 billion in federal funding for green projects. Most of these projects were axed in 16 states where Trump lost the 2024 election.

In February 2025, the Trump administration rescinded or froze $21 billion for previously approved Michigan clean energy projects. This includes $400 million for consumer energy rebates, weatherization assistance for Michigan homes, $102 million to fortify the state’s electric grid against intensifying storms, and $500 million for battery manufacturing for electric vehicles. For energy producers, the Trump administration froze or rescinded $20 billion in loans or loan guarantees for clean energy projects by Consumers Energy and DTE Energy. This includes the delay of a $1.5 billion loan guarantee for reopening the Palisades nuclear plant.

Michigan was on its way to replacing fossil fuels, especially coal, with renewable energy to supply its electricity demand. As reported in Downtown in 2021, the state’s renewable energy portfolio increased from 10 percent in 2015 to 15 percent in 2021. Consumers Energy in 2021 announced plans to increase its use of renewable energy to 35 percent by 2025, and 47 percent by 2030. DTE continued to build renewable energy facilities and planned to reduce carbon emissions by 50 percent by 2030, and 80 percent by 2040.

Consumers Energy’s J.H. Campbell coal-fired electric plant in West Olive was first slated for closure in May of this year and remains open via a series of presidential executive orders. Trump issued them as an emergency directive under the Department of Energy; the Trump administration ordered the plant to remain open until at least mid-November. Trump reasoned the executive order was a necessary decision to keep up with electricity demand in the heat of the summer, along with the onset of a more robust manufacturing sector and the exponential growth of artificial intelligence.

The administration in September also announced it is going to open 13.1 million acres of public lands for increased coal mining.

“Campbell was the last coal-fired electric plant Consumers had to retire, and the Trump administration forced it to stay open,” Johnson said. “It is old, outdated, and costly for the taxpayers to run to the tune of one million dollars per day. The (energy) market has made coal a thing of the past. Consumers already had plans to replace Campbell’s capacity with other sources of energy, like natural gas. But at the last minute, Trump’s Department of Energy said, ‘Nope. We are forcing you to stay open.’”

Now, Johnson explained, Consumers Energy is scrambling to buy coal through a supply chain that is highly costly to the taxpayer. This rate is too much for Michigan rate payers to shoulder by themselves, so now the cost to buy coal is spread across 10 other states, he said.

Amidst this dirty laundry list of rollbacks, deregulations, and defunding of decades of environmental progress, one has to ask: Is all of this legal?

The litigation against the Trump administration’s draconian cuts against the environment is playing out in multi-state lawsuits led by state attorneys general, including Mihigan’s Dana Nessel, and raising public awareness by environmental watchdog and policy groups.

In May, Nessel joined a coalition of 18 attorneys general against the Trump administration over what they describe as an unlawful attempt to freeze the development of wind energy. She also joined another multistate lawsuit opposing the possible rescinding of the 2009 Endangerment Finding.

In August, Nessel testified before the EPA and warned that rescinding the 2009 Endangerment Finding would exacerbate the ravages of climate change on the state’s economy, natural resources, and the health of its residents even further.

According to Nessel, Michigan is already experiencing increasingly severe drought conditions that impact the state’s $104 billion agricultural industry. This includes the state’s famed cherry crop, which in 2024 saw a harvest loss of 75 percent due to rain, pests and harsh swings in temperature.

“I strenuously oppose the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s unlawful and ill-conceived proposal to rescind its 2009 greenhouse gas endangerment finding,” Nessel said in her testimony. “In 2009, the EPA determined that greenhouse gas pollutants present a very clear and immediate danger to our environment, economy, and the world. This finding was supported by years of due diligence to evaluate the scientific consensus. This proposed rulemaking suggests we allow the federal government to ignore its own scientific determinations and abdicate its legal duty to act. This simply cannot stand.”

Michigan’s Democratic delegation in Congress is also fighting the EPA’s dismantling of longstanding policy.

In a statement emailed to Downtown, Rep. Debbie Dingell (MI-06) said the 2009 Endangerment Finding is fundamental to our environmental and public health protections. She crafted a letter to Zeldin, signed by the Michigan Democratic Congressional delegation, and submitted it to the EPA’s public comment section.

Writing to Downtown, she stated: “The 2009 Endangerment Finding is the foundation for legal enforcement of limits on the greenhouse gases that pose a danger to our climate and wellbeing.”

She continued: “Michiganders are already witnessing the impacts of climate change in worsening weather events that include extreme heat, devastating floods, an increase in tornadoes, and dangerous wildfire smoke. Michiganders are also dealing with toxic hazards such as the Gelman dioxane plume in Washtenaw County and other industrial pollutants that have yet to be cleaned up.”

Dingell said if the Endangerment Finding is repealed, the very basis of the country’s most important environmental protections will be stripped away, giving polluters a free pass at the expense of our communities.

Dingell added. “I cannot state strongly enough how important it is to maintain the Endangerment Finding and uphold the EPA’s duty to protect Americans’ health and wellbeing.”

The pains from federal cuts to the EPA have trickled down to the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy (EGLE).

On October 7, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer signed a long-awaited budget for fiscal year 2026 with several cuts to environmental funding. Whitmer did, however, soften the blow to the sharpest cuts to EGLE. While an earlier State House proposal suggested a 19 percent cut to EGLE, Whitmer reduced those cuts to seven percent.

The Department of Natural Resources will have fewer resources for fishery stocking and maintenance. Michiganders will see reduced hours and services at state parks and museums. According to State Rep. Noah Arbit (D-West Bloomfield), his constituents say the cuts come at a cost to monitoring the waters of inland lakes for safe practices and training in boating, fishing, and swimming. Because of the lack of federal dollars, there is just $1.3 million to distribute among all county sheriff departments for marine safety patrols. This could impact response time for marine emergencies.

“In the past, there have been grants that fuse state and federal funds to make sure people out enjoying the lakes are safe,” Arbit said. “The feds completely eviscerated that funding. While our wealthiest counties, like here in Oakland County, will be okay individually providing resources for a while, eventually, all the counties are going to feel the cuts.”

From a regulatory standpoint, Arbit said that last year, a Democrat-controlled state House repealed a law put in place by Republicans that stipulated that no state law would be more stringent than a federal law.

“We repealed this law and can now make laws and regulations that are stricter than federal ones,” Arbit said. “One area where this may be beneficial is on the topic of forever chemicals in our drinking water. I am hearing from my constituents a lot of concern about PFAS levels in the drinking water, something which the Trump administration no longer seems to be interested in regulating. On top of that, we still have some municipalities that still encounter lead in their drinking water. The EPA is now delaying the distribution of allocated funding to communities to remove lead service lines.”

Overall, Arbit believes protecting the environment through robust regulation should remain a bipartisan issue.

It is a shame that environmental issues and protection have become a hyperpartisan issue,” Arbit said. “Clean drinking water free of forever chemicals should matter to both Democrats and Republicans. It is egregious that the Trump administration, Republicans in Congress, and the state House Republicans have decided that the environment is a Democratic issue. It is an egregious way to, you know, go about policymaking and leaves so many constituents, both Democratic and Republican, in the lurch.”

The Chicago-based Environmental Law and Policy Center (ELPC) has kept a sharp eye on the rollbacks and is keeping legal pressure on the Administration through issuing public comments on several rollbacks and filing lawsuits.

In July, the ELPC teamed with 11 health, environmental, and community groups and filed a lawsuit that challenged the Trump administration’s delay of the 2024 methane standards for the oil and gas industry — standards that keep dangerous pollution out of our air and reduce wasted energy from oil and gas leaks.

In October, ELPC attorney Max Lopez testified in Congress against the EPA’s proposal to excuse industrial polluters from reporting on their emission rates of greenhouse gases and urged the agency to abandon its plans to scrap the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program.

Lopez said the program is vital not only to collect data on emissions coming from industrial sites but also a key resource for public utility commissions for making decisions, especially helpful in staying within the boundaries of state law climate initiatives and long-term planning to stabilize the electric grid. Lopez stated that removing the mandate to report on greenhouse gases would make it more difficult for public utility commissions to make informed decisions for consumers.

Lopez added that without this reporting, states, regulators, and communities lose a critical tool for holding polluters accountable.

Callie Sharp, an associate attorney with ELPC, said such rollbacks will further degrade the quality of the Great Lakes with consequences such as continued extreme heat, erratic weather patterns that could lead to crop and fisheries destruction, and the loss of lives and property.

Sharp said the EPA’s current stance on the 2009 Endangerment Finding, for example, is in clear violation of the Clean Water and Clean Air Acts, which are the overarching laws at the root of decades of protection policies and regulations. She also warned that the Trump administration could use the rescission of the Endangerment Finding to repeal other types of greenhouse gas emission regulations.

“EPA’s main argument in their proposal to rescind the Endangerment finding is essentially an attempt to redefine what an air pollutant is under the Clean Air Act,” Sharp said. “This argument does not hold up with the language of the statute and contradicts Supreme Court precedents that date back decades. The EPA has one job, and that’s to protect the environment and public health. The agency’s core responsibility is to the public and is to the environment, but reversing the endangerment finding is really betraying that mission and jeopardizing America’s future by prioritizing the deregulation of industry.”","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/ee9c1b_acc74a0c96064f5ba96605b9e37a8f6b~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_1000,h_638,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01/ee9c1b_acc74a0c96064f5ba96605b9e37a8f6b~mv2.jpg",N,,2025-10-29 12:07:00.625291

The companies said there were “six AP1000 reactors currently setting operational performance and availability records worldwide with 14 additional reactors under construction and five more under contract”.

Brookfield said: “At the centre of the new strategic partnership, at least $80 billion of new reactors will be constructed across the United States using Westinghouse nuclear reactor technology. These new reactors will reinvigorate the nuclear power industrial base.

“As a result of this historic agreement, nuclear energy deployment will be a central pillar of America’s programme to maintain global leadership in nuclear power development and artificial intelligence.”

President Trump’s second term has been marked by a flurry of company pledges to expand production in the United States. From Apple’s plan to source glass covers for iPhones from a Kentucky plant to Stellantis’s investments across four states, the announcements suggest a resurgence of industrial activity.

Tariffs have pushed some companies to boost manufacturing in the United States, but have also driven up the cost of raw materials and specialized machines. Federal incentives for clean energy have been rolled back, prompting some electric vehicle battery plants to be canceled. And the Trump administration’s crackdown on immigration has made it more difficult for some facilities to hire workers.

These challenges, along with other longstanding issues, such as underinvestment in technology and training programs, weigh on the sector and offer a mixed picture of success.

Factory construction in the United States has increased, spurred by supply-chain disruptions during the Covid-19 pandemic and large federal subsidies for semiconductors and clean energy passed during the Biden administration. But there are signs that the boom could be fading.

Spending on factory construction by all sorts of companies — one of the clearest barometers of the “Made in America” revival — went from around 3.5 percent of the manufacturing economy in 2021 to 8 percent in 2024, a level not seen in more than 40 years, said Paul Donovan, the global chief economist at UBS Wealth Management. Spending has declined from its peak in the third quarter of 2024, he said, although it remains high.

The dip may have been partly driven by uncertainty surrounding tariffs and fears that the rising cost of imported materials would render construction projects unprofitable.

Some companies canceled construction projects immediately after Mr. Trump announced tariffs on dozens of countries in April, said Michael Guckes, chief economist of ConstructConnect, a company that provides software and market insight to construction industry professionals. But building has picked up again.

Nearly $86 billion was spent on manufacturing facilities from January to September, driven in part by investments in high-value semiconductor factories and pharmaceutical facilities, Mr. Guckes added. “It has been a very strong year for manufacturing,” he said.

Factory jobs are declining.

About 12.7 million people work in manufacturing in the United States — a modest rebound from the pandemic’s lows. But the sector has been shedding jobs, a slow bleed that obscures deeper shifts. Some of the steepest losses came in semiconductors, auto parts and aerospace — industries once heralded as pillars of a manufacturing revival.

“What we hear from our respondents, it is mostly about not backfilling positions,” he said.

Mass layoffs in the sector have mostly been avoided, but an exception is Intel, which has received billions in federal funding. The domestic chipmaker is shrinking its work force by about 25,000 employees this year.

Some facilities have found it more difficult to hire or retain workers after the Trump administration revoked temporary protected status for about 500,000 Haitians, Venezuelans, Cubans and Nicaraguans. In July, more than 200 immigrants were let go from a JBS pork production facility in Iowa because they were no longer eligible to work legally in the United States.

American factories have been slow to deploy robots.

Despite bursts of investment in recent years, the United States trails much of the developed world in harnessing automation to boost productivity. The country ranks just 10th globally in its reliance on robots, lagging behind Slovenia, Switzerland and a host of Asian economies that have made automation a priority, according to the International Federation of Robotics.

Most American factories are small businesses that have traditionally struggled to embrace and afford new technology. The price of an industrial robot has fallen over the past decade, but the upfront investment remains steep for many firms. And even those willing to spend on robots often struggle to find workers who can program, operate and maintain the machines.

It is unclear whether a new wave of tax credits and work force training initiatives can finally close that gap — or whether the world’s manufacturing powerhouses will continue to pull ahead.

Productivity growth in the manufacturing sector lags the ‘white collar’ economy.

Jim Farley, the chief executive of Ford Motor, has raised alarms for months about what he considers one of the biggest problems in the economy: The productivity of sectors that make, fix and transport things in America has flatlined or declined over the last decade, while the productivity of “white collar” sectors like business services has grown at a far healthier rate.

But measuring productivity — which economists define as the value of goods and services produced per hour of work — is notoriously tricky, experts say. While government data shows that productivity growth in manufacturing has been sluggish ever since the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, economists argue that official statistics fail to capture increases in the quality of products.

A new working paper by Enghin Atalay, Ali Hortacsu, Nicole Kimmel and Chad Syverson provides evidence that productivity growth in American manufacturing was stronger than previously thought.

As “smart factories” squeeze efficiencies from machines and workers, using sensors to catch defects, predict breakdowns and cut waste, there’s hope for a breakthrough. Still, manufacturing accounts for a shrinking share of the American economy, which is still dominated by services. China, by contrast, remains deeply reliant on manufacturing, which has powered its rise.

Wealthy countries provided roughly $26 billion for climate adaptation in 2023, a 7 percent drop from the previous year, according to the United Nations Environment Program. Those nations are now “unlikely” to meet a major pledge to provide at least $40 billion in annual aid by 2025, the agency said. And even that amount is only a fraction of what developing countries may need to cope with worsening climate shocks.

The findings are another sign that global efforts to tackle climate change have noticeably flagged. President Trump is withdrawing the United States from the 2015 Paris climate agreement, in which virtually every country agreed to limit the emissions that are rapidly heating the planet.

While other world leaders are still planning to meet without Mr. Trump next month in Belém, Brazil, for the annual U.N. summit on climate change, those talks are already getting off to a rocky start.

Only about one-third of the countries have met a deadline to update their national plans to curb emissions, the United Nations said in a separate report on Tuesday.

“The overall sluggish progress should send shock waves through every citizen,” said Ilana Seid, an ambassador from Palau who chairs the Alliance of Small Island States, an influential negotiating bloc of vulnerable countries at the U.N. climate talks.

In less than a year, Amazon transformed vast Indiana cornfields into its largest AI data center yet, an astonishing feat of rapid deployment and engineering. This colossal facility is not merely a testament to Amazon’s logistical prowess but a strategic declaration in the high-stakes race for AI dominance, particularly through its commitment to homegrown chips and key partnerships.

CNBC’s MacKenzie Sigalos provided an exclusive inside look at this monumental project, interviewing key figures like Matt Garman, CEO of Amazon Web Services (AWS), and Mike Krieger, Chief Product Officer at Anthropic. Their discussions, featured on ‘Squawk Box’, illuminated Amazon’s aggressive strategy to build out the physical backbone for advanced AI models, highlighting both the technological ambition and the burgeoning societal challenges that accompany such immense undertakings.

At the heart of Amazon’s strategy is a bold bet on proprietary AI chips, a move designed to reduce reliance on third-party silicon and optimize performance for specific AI workloads. This Indiana compound, once fully completed, will host 30 buildings, seven of which are already operational. Crucially, it was built exclusively for Anthropic, a prominent rival to OpenAI, which is now running its Claude models on half a million of Amazon’s in-house AI chips, dubbed Trainium 2. This direct integration and co-development signify Amazon’s “build-it-and-they-will-come” approach, creating tailored infrastructure that attracts leading AI developers and locks them into the AWS ecosystem.

The speed of execution is remarkable. Matt Garman emphasized this velocity, stating, “This is not some future project… this is running and training their models today.” This immediate operational capability provides Amazon with a significant competitive edge, allowing it to translate capital expenditure directly into active, revenue-generating AI workloads. The relentless pace of expansion is also evident in Garman’s candid admission: “We’re rapidly adding new capacity all over the place, and so I don’t know that we’ll be done ever. We’re going to continue to build as our customers need more capacity.”

This massive complex will draw more than two gigawatts of electricity, enough to power over 1.6 million homes.

The ability to rapidly deploy such complex infrastructure is a critical differentiator in the AI arms race. Mike Krieger from Anthropic lauded Amazon’s execution, noting, “These deals all sound great on paper, but they only materialize when they’re actually racked and loaded and usable by the customer, and Amazon is incredible at that.” This sentiment underscores the practical challenges of scaling AI compute and Amazon’s unique capability to deliver tangible resources at speed, leveraging decades of experience in building large-scale physical infrastructure like warehouses.

Amazon’s decision to power this facility with its own Trainium 2 chips is a direct challenge to the current dominance of Nvidia in the AI hardware market. Sigalos highlighted this, noting it is “the largest cluster of non-Nvidia chips anywhere in the world.” This strategic move aims to diversify the AI chip supply chain and potentially offer more cost-effective and specialized solutions to AWS customers, fostering an environment where innovation isn’t bottlenecked by a single hardware provider. It signals a new infrastructure race where hyperscalers are not just competing on cloud services but on the underlying, custom-designed hardware that powers the next generation of AI.

However, the rapid expansion of these energy-intensive data centers is not without its challenges. Local communities, like New Carlisle in Indiana, are beginning to voice concerns over the environmental impact and potential strains on local resources. As Becky Quick pointed out, there’s a growing “not in my backyard” sentiment, with residents worried about rising prices and the sheer scale of these industrial installations. The local power utility, for instance, anticipates peak demand to double once the full campus is online, raising questions about energy supply and sustainability. Despite these concerns, as Sigalos noted, for many communities, the arrival of these tech giants feels like an “inevitable reality” they must adapt to, driven by a mix of local incentives and robust grid power, including nuclear and gas options.

Amazon’s $11 billion investment in Indiana is more than just a data center; it’s a blueprint for the future of AI infrastructure. By combining proprietary chip development, strategic partnerships with leading AI model developers, and an unparalleled capacity for rapid, large-scale construction, Amazon is solidifying its position as a foundational layer in the evolving AI landscape.

Bob Ferguson launched the ZEVergreen initiative via the Department of Ecology in response to President Donald Trump’s cuts in federal funding for electric vehicle rebates.

While the statewide effort is intended to help reduce costs switching to EVs as part of a goal of achieving transportation electrification, some trucking industry stakeholders note that the price tag is only one of several challenge for their businesses.

Aside from a state law that will prohibit the registration of new gasoline-powered vehicles starting in 2035, Washington is also participating in California’s Advanced Clean Trucks program pushing the gradual adoption of electric trucks, which imposes sale percentages for EV trucks.

Although the federal government has sought to remove that power and a lawsuit remains over the matter, there’s been disputes over what is to blame for the trucking industry’s failure to meet sales expectations. In a report published last year, the Electric Vehicle Coordinating Council attributed it to “market failure,” while a nonprofit representation at a July council meeting said the trucking industry was “taking every single opportunity to undermine the success of the Advanced Clean Trucks regulation.”

Although the cost differences have been noted – $400,000 for an EV truck compared to $150,00 for a diesel truck – Washington Trucking Associations President Sheri Call told Ecology officials at Monday’s public session discussing ZEVergreen that while “this initiative is to address affordability … there still exist operational challenges, and we really don’t see that changing with the weight of the trucks that are significantly heavier; so less productive and potentially more vehicles on the road.”

Among those logistical challenges for EV trucks is that they require recharging more frequently than diesel trucks do refueling, and recharging takes considerably longer. Additionally, cold temperatures significantly reduce battery capacity unless the vehicles are stored properly.

Call added that aside from the upfront price of an EV truck, “another issue under the financing and cost challenges is insurability. [I’m] just wondering if that’s also kind of analyzed and looked at as we move forward here in our in our planning.”

Ecology Zero Emissions Vehicle Specialist Joshua Grandbouche said that with regard to insurance, “that’s not something that we had fully thought through at this point in time, but that that why we’re having this call, right?”

Concerning other challenges associated with the use of EV trucks, he said “we are looking longer term at what might address the weight issue and the logistical issues that you come up with zero-motion vehicles. These are just conversations that we’ve been having with folks and there’s a lot of uncertainty. We are looking at different vehicle technologies, such as battery swapping, that would address both logistical problems, as well as weight issues and cost issues technologies that we’ve been hearing about would be deployable in America, but we do see them deployed in other countries.”

“Longer term, how can we build technologies and solutions that make it much easier to transition the vehicle that aren’t as easy to transition today?” he added.

Offering public comment at the public session for ZEVergreen, Washington Policy Center Vice President for Research Todd Myers told Ecology officials that “whatever goals or metrics this program is designed to achieve, that there is a way to assure that those are achieved and what are the standards. Whatever plan you come up with, make sure that you have not just the goals, but a contingency for what happens if you don’t meet the goals.”",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/thecentersquare.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/c/ed/ced1c73e-d00d-11ed-986f-635e890ac086/6427557076320.image.jpg,N,,2025-10-29 11:24:31.342593

The second Trump administration has issued four executive orders supporting a substantial increase in nuclear power generation capacity.
Future Nuclear Growth Officials on Tuesday said the partnership will support future growth in U.S. nuclear power, along with the equipment supply chain.
The group said its AP1000 technology also has been selected for nuclear energy programs in Poland, Ukraine, and Bulgaria.","Westinghouse Electric Co. has joined with Canada-based Cameco Corp. and Brookfield Asset Management in a partnership that would advance deployment of nuclear power technology across the U.S.

The groups on October 28 said at least $80 billion of new reactors, primarily AP1000 units from Westinghouse, would be built at the behest of the U.S. government. Officials on Tuesday in a news release wrote that under the “historic agreement” the new reactors “will reinvigorate the nuclear power industrial base,” and would make nuclear energy “a central pillar of America’s program to maintain global leadership in nuclear power development and Artificial Intelligence (AI).”

Officials said the U.S. government will arrange financing and help secure permits for the Westinghouse reactors. The strategy offers the U.S. government a 20% share of future profits from the assets, after Westinghouse has paid out at least $17.5 billion to Brookfield and Cameco. The companies said the U.S. government could turn those gains into an equity stake of up to 20%, and the deal also would require an initial public offering of Westinghouse stock by 2029 if the company’s value surpasses $30 billion.

The plan was announced Tuesday after President Trump, who is on a trip to Asia, said in Tokyo that Japan will provide up to $332 billion to support U.S. infrastructure projects. The investment would include construction of Westinghouse AP1000 reactors, and also small modular nuclear reactors, or SMRs.

“Our administration is focused on ensuring the rapid development, deployment, and use of advanced nuclear technologies. This historic partnership supports our national security objectives and enhances our critical infrastructure,” said Howard Lutnick, secretary for the U.S. Dept. of Commerce.”Together with Westinghouse we will unleash American energy.”

Energy Secretary Chris Wright said, “This historic partnership with America’s leading nuclear company will help unleash President Trump’s grand vision to fully energize America and win the global AI race. President Trump promised a renaissance of nuclear power, and now he is delivering.”

Years of Support

The federal government has earmarked billions of dollars for development of nuclear power since the Obama administration. That administration approved $8.33 billion in federal loan guarantees to help finance the construction of two new nuclear reactors at Georgia’s Vogtle nuclear power station, a project completed in 2024. The two-unit expansion at the Plant Vogtle site won POWER’s Plant of the Year Award last year.

The Obama administration also invested in the development and licensing of advanced SMR technologies. The U.S. Dept. of Energy (DOE) in 2015 provided billions in loan guarantees to support the next generation of nuclear technologies, and also that year announced the Gateway for Accelerated Innovation in Nuclear, or GAIN, program to help develop advanced reactor designs.

There has been bipartisan congressional support for nuclear power for several years. A Pew Research Center survey published earlier this month said about 60% of U.S. adults surveyed favor the use of more nuclear power to generate electricity, up from 43% in 2020.

The second Trump administration has issued four executive orders supporting a substantial increase in nuclear power generation capacity. President Trump in July of this year signed legislation preserving many tax incentives for nuclear power.

Future Nuclear Growth

Officials on Tuesday said the partnership will support future growth in U.S. nuclear power, along with the equipment supply chain. The companies in announcing the agreement said that “Each two-unit Westinghouse AP1000 project creates or sustains 45,000 manufacturing and engineering jobs in 43 states, and a national deployment will create more than 100,000 construction jobs. The program will cement the United States as one of the world’s nuclear energy powerhouses and increase exports of Westinghouse’s nuclear power generation technology globally.”

Connor Teskey, president of Brookfield Asset Management, said, “This partnership with the U.S. government will help unlock the potential that Westinghouse and nuclear energy can play to accelerate the growth of artificial intelligence in the United States, while meeting growing electricity demand and energy security needs at scale. Brookfield has more than half a trillion dollars invested in the critical infrastructure that underpins the U.S. economy, and we expect to double that investment in the next decade as we deliver on building the infrastructure backbone of artificial intelligence.”

Brookfield is in negotiations with Santee Cooper to restart construction of two AP1000 reactors at the VC Summer site in South Carolina, eight years after that nuclear power project was abandoned in the wake of Westinghouse filing for bankruptcy.

“Our goals include completing these reactors with private money and no ratepayer or taxpayer expense, delivering financial relief to our customers and gaining significant additional power capacity for South Carolina,” Peter McCoy, Santee Cooper board chairman, said this week. “Brookfield’s proposal would do just that, and the company has the financial capability to stand behind its proposal.”

Westinghouse and U.S. Nuclear Power

Westinghouse is considered a global leader in nuclear energy, and its technology serves as the basis for more than half the world’s operating nuclear power fleet. The company began building nuclear power plants in the U.S. in the 1950s.

Two Japanese firms—Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, along with Toshiba IHI (a joint venture of Toshiba and IHI)—may be involved in building up to $100 billion of Westinghouse reactors. That’s according to a fact sheet issued after Trump’s meeting with Sanae Takaichi, Japan’s new and first female prime minister, on Tuesday.

Lutnick at a business dinner Tuesday in Tokyo announced up to $490 billion in commitments by Japan to the U.S., including the $100 billion for nuclear power projects involving Westinghouse and GE Vernova.

Westinghouse noted that the company currently has 14 AP1000 reactors under construction worldwide, with five more under contract. The group said its AP1000 technology also has been selected for nuclear energy programs in Poland, Ukraine, and Bulgaria.

Brookfield, which invests in power generation technologies, and Cameco formed a partnership to acquire Westinghouse in October 2022. Cameco is recognized for its expertise in the nuclear industry, including the nuclear fuel supply chain. Brookfield initially acquired Westinghouse in 2018 after the latter’s bankruptcy, and had led a successful turnaround that has benefited from renewed investment in nuclear power.

“Our highly successful partnership with Brookfield as owners of Westinghouse will be further strengthened through this collaboration with the U.S. government,” said Tim Gitzel, CEO of Cameco. “We expect this new partnership to support the global growth opportunities for both Westinghouse’s and Cameco’s nuclear products, services and technologies, adding significant long-term value for our stakeholders and enhancing energy, national and climate security around the world. As a strategic partner, Cameco is a secure and reliable western-based supplier of the uranium fuel needed to support the civilian deployment and long-term reliable operation of Westinghouse’s technology in the U.S. and globally.”",https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/stock_ap1000-nuclear-plant-model_westinghouse.jpg,N,,2025-10-29 11:00:52.177298

For immediate release: October 28, 2025

Los Angeles, Calif. – Clean Power Alliance (CPA), the nation’s leading green power provider and California’s largest community choice energy aggregator, is pleased to announce the cities of La Cañada Flintridge, Lynwood and Port Hueneme began electricity service with CPA October 2025.

The addition of these new partner communities expands CPA’s service territory to 38 communities and furthers its mission to bring clean, competitively priced energy options to residents and businesses throughout Southern California. The cities’ participation with Clean Power Alliance reflects a shared and growing commitment to local sustainability efforts in California.

With service to over three million residents and businesses across Los Angeles and Ventura counties, Clean Power Alliance continues to expand its impact. Across all communities CPA serves, customers collectively prevent more than 3.8 billion pounds of greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) each year. More than 33,000 new customers from these three cities will help prevent an additional 128 million pounds of GHGs annually – equivalent to removing 13,500 gas-powered cars from the road or planting and growing 958,000 trees for 10 years.

“These cities have made a strong commitment to the wellbeing of their community by joining CPA. They are providing the people who live and work there with access to local, clean and reliable energy solutions,” said City of Agoura Hills Council Member and CPA Board Chair Deborah Klein Lopez. “When new communities join CPA, that growth further strengthens our ability to secure competitive energy prices, invest in renewable energy projects and create customer programs that deliver measurable benefits to residents and businesses.”

Customers in these communities will now have access to CPA’s suite of programs designed to expand equitable access to clean energy, provide bill savings for customers and support local resilience and sustainability efforts. CPA has dedicated more than $14 million in funding for customer programs this fiscal year.

Customers served by CPA benefit from:

Cleaner energy mix with more renewables and reduced fossil fuels

Stable rates and opportunities for bill savings through demand response and energy efficiency programs

Local impact and sustainability with targeted investments that improve community resilience

Choice and control with the ability to select from multiple clean energy options

The City of La Cañada Flintridge has selected 100% Green Power as its preferred energy option to serve its community. Choosing 100% Green Power – 100% renewable energy, primarily from wind, solar and geothermal sources – will help La Cañada Flintridge avoid more than 105 million pounds of GHGs each year.

“The City of La Cañada Flintridge is proud to join Clean Power Alliance to advance a cleaner, more sustainable energy future,” said Council Member and CPA Board Director Stephanie Fossan. “Beginning this month, we made the switch to 100% Green Power—delivering competitively priced electricity while supporting long-term sustainability for our community and helping to make California greener.”

The City of Lynwood has selected Clean Power – 50% clean energy, including at least 25% renewables and 25% carbon-free large hydropower – as its preferred energy option, helping Lynwood avoid more than 22 million pounds of GHGs each year.

“This partnership with Clean Power Alliance represents a major step toward environmental justice for Lynwood,” said Council Member and CPA Board Director Juan Munoz-Guevara. “Our community has long felt the effects of pollution from surrounding freeways and industrial activity. Providing residents with clean, affordable energy is part of our commitment to a healthier, more resilient and more sustainable Lynwood.”

The city of Port Hueneme also selected Clean Power as its preferred energy option, avoiding more than 6 million pounds of GHGs emissions each year.

“Port Hueneme’s decision to join the Clean Power Alliance reflects our community’s commitment to a cleaner and more sustainable future,” said Council Member and CPA Board Director Laura Hernandez. “By expanding access to renewable energy, we’re not only reducing our carbon footprint but also giving our residents and businesses more choice and control over their energy. This marks an important step that allows the city and its residents to help protect our environment on a long-term basis.”

With the addition of La Cañada Flintridge, Lynwood and Port Hueneme, CPA continues to build momentum toward a cleaner, more resilient energy future for California. This progress also reflects the expanding statewide movement of Community Choice Aggregators working together to put clean energy choice in the hands of local communities and driving California’s clean energy transition.

Sure, Toyota got into the electrification game early with the Prius, and now the bulk of its U.S. cars and trucks are hybrids too. But it’s long maintained that people may never be ready to fully break up with gasoline, especially in some corners of the world where it sells cars. It’s taken a “slow and steady” approach to EVs instead.

Now, the ubiquitous Corolla is getting an electric option too—while its architecture stays flexible for gas and hybrid power as well. And that’s about to provoke an interesting thought experiment among the EV faithful: What if Toyota was right all along?

30%: Toyota’s ‘Multi-Pathway Approach’ Gets The Ultimate Test

Toyota Corolla Concept (2026)

Toyota calls it “multi-pathway”: the future of reducing carbon emissions can take on many forms, from more efficient gas engines to EVs to hydrogen and hybrids. (It also helps to be Toyota, and have its massive scale and capital, when this is your strategy.)

But no Toyota we’ve seen yet is as multi-pathway as the next Corolla, unveiled yesterday at the Japan Mobility Show. And it may be the ultimate test for this thesis: if the world's best-selling car goes electric, hybrid and gas, which one will people buy, and where?

It's an ambitious move, and a needed one as the world keeps getting more choices for affordable EVs. And at Automotive News, longtime Toyota correspondent Larry Vellequette argues this ""slow and steady"" approach to EVs may just pay off at a time when the tax-credit sales rush goes away and demand for these cars must mature on its own:

Amid challenges and criticisms, the one thing that Toyota repeatedly does right is set a course and stick to it. In the U.S., that means moving forward with electric vehicles while continuing to expand hybrids and plug-in hybrid availability across the market and throughout its lineup.

Toyota’s $14 billion battery complex in North Carolina is beginning to produce batteries for its electrified vehicles in North America. Meanwhile, it still plans to introduce new three-row EVs next year that will be built in Kentucky, as well as bring in other new EVs, including the C-HR.

Why? Because it won’t be pushing those EVs on its dealers and customers, but allowing both to pull the vehicles as real market demand for them grows naturally—just as demand has grown for hybrids. Toyota’s determination to follow the multipath powertrain strategy it adopted nearly a decade ago has allowed it to capture share from competitors, especially those who now find themselves flat-footed because they opted to not offer hybrids.

He makes some cogent points about the current mass-market realities for EVs. I'd add that, with any luck, early Toyota EVs like the bZ4X were first-draft experiments that allow later ones to be better. It is true that with tax credits going away in America, there are no more participation trophies to be awarded for simply making EVs to meet various regulations; they have to be good, and people have to want them because they're better than gas cars and cost about the same.

There are plenty of people who will naturally demand an EV from Toyota, especially if it's a compelling one. And the automaker is rolling out a bevy of promising new electric models, like the bZ, bZ Woodland and C-HR. This new Corolla looks great; I hope the electric version has some competitive specs.

Whatever's next in the electric world is about moving beyond the early adopters. Maybe Toyota nailed that timing after all, but as with anything, it's all going to come down to the strength of the product, not cheap lease deals and incentives.

60%: Rivian Won’t Tap U.S. Loan Until 2028, CFO Says

Rivian R2

If you don't believe me, just ask Rivian's CEO, RJ Scaringe. His company is facing a downturn too, but he's told us he is confident his future products, like the R2, can win because they're great—not because they're heavily incentivized.

Still, Rivian has a long road to get to long-term stability. A $6.6 billion loan from the U.S. Department of Energy approved during the Biden years will help get its Georgia EV factory going, but Rivian's CFO told Bloomberg it doesn't intend to use that money right away:

CFO Claire McDonough said the electric-vehicle maker anticipates starting construction on the factory next year and seeking reimbursement from a US Department of Energy loan once it’s completed. “It’d be prior to starting production in 2028 that we’d be drawing down the loan,” she told reporters Tuesday in Detroit.

The loan was finalized in January during the waning days of President Joe Biden’s administration, but President Donald Trump has been critical of that type of government financing. Energy Secretary Chris Wright in May said his agency doesn’t plan to move forward with billions of dollars worth of Biden-era loans.

Rivian’s plan to request funding via the loan in 2028 would come in the next US presidential election year.

It's now hard to say whether that loan will hang in the balance of the next election, but it has been finalized and approved—although the current administration has a unique talent for holding up funding for such projects when it wants to. Either way, it will work on the Georgia factory on its own dime in the meantime.

90%: China May End Subsidies For EVs

Here's the thing about subsidies: you can't expect them to last forever. (Unless you're the American oil industry, obviously.) China's national government has poured billions of dollars into building an advanced, software-powered EV sector. But the country's next five-year economic plan will not include more of them, Reuters reports:

Top policymakers omitted electric vehicles from their list of strategic industries in their recent five-year development plan for 2026-2030, the industry's first exclusion in more than a decade.

Analysts say the move is evidence that Beijing considers the industry to be mature and no longer requires the same level of financial support, leaving its development up to market forces.

But they say the omission should not be seen as a sign that the EV industry has fallen out of favour, despite it becoming a poster child for excessive competition that even President Xi Jinping has criticised. Instead, it reflects a strategic decision to allocate resources to other technologies where China seeks to enhance its capabilities, especially in light of global trade and security tensions.

""It's an official acknowledgement that electric vehicles no longer need prioritised policies. Electric vehicle subsidies will fade,"" said Dan Wang, China director at consultancy Eurasia Group.

As I said in the Toyota segment: at some point, this field has to stand on its own. In various global markets, an end to subsidies has meant a decline in EV sales. But if any market is mature enough to survive without them, it's probably China, right? And nobody ever believed that all of its 129 (!!!) brands that currently sell electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids would all survive forever.

It's time for some good, old-fashioned, market-driven survival of the fittest. Good luck with that, China.

100%: Was Toyota Right?

When you look at its current profits and hybrid sales, it certainly did something right. But will Toyota's slower approach to EVs pay off in the end? I'd argue this is a bigger problem in Europe, which has a more advanced EV market and tougher competition, and in China, where sales have been down like almost every other legacy player, but remains too important to neglect.

While other colleges offer EV education, WCC is unique in offering a three-pronged approach that emphasizes servicing, programming, and manufacturing.
“100,000 lines of code are going through your car at any given time, so we teach students more than how to service the battery,” Tucker says.
“They want us to train their technicians, because if someone has been in a technician job, they have maybe never dealt with EVs,” Tucker says.","Building on its long-term commitment to mobility education, Washtenaw Community College (WCC) has unveiled a new electric vehicle (EV) and battery laboratory. Equipped with vehicle lifts, charging stations, and electric battery workbenches, the space prepares students to perform essential maintenance and repairs on hybrid and electric vehicles.

“It’s a really exciting time for us,” says Brandon Tucker, executive vice president for instruction at WCC. “We’ve expanded the offerings within our Advanced Transportation Center, which isn’t a building, but a combination of programs that support the mobility industry.”

Open since 2014, the Advanced Transportation Center serves more than 1,000 students enrolled in over 60 courses in automotive and cybersecurity technologies alone. Training offered through the center focuses on EVs, batteries, charging infrastructure and transportation technologies, semiconductor manufacturing, mechatronics and industrial electronics, cybersecurity and data analytics, and artificial intelligence and business intelligence.

Tucker emphasizes that the training is hands-on and focused on real-world applications. At the EV lab, students can take cars apart. The battery lab beside it allows instructors to show students how to safely handle batteries.

‘We’ve heard that EVs are dangerous. Well, they’re not dangerous if you know how to operate them,” Tucker says. “We know that EVs have big batteries that are dangerous. We’re showing students how to remove those batteries and service vehicles in the safest way possible.”

He explains that WCC’s efforts are closely aligned with industry talent needs. While other colleges offer EV education, WCC is unique in offering a three-pronged approach that emphasizes servicing, programming, and manufacturing.

“100,000 lines of code are going through your car at any given time, so we teach students more than how to service the battery,” Tucker says. “We also look at the infotainment system, or some features that may go haywire. How do you reprogram or diagnose those?”

Tucker says local employers are already reaching out to WCC staff about how the lab can support their businesses.

“They want us to train their technicians, because if someone has been in a technician job, they have maybe never dealt with EVs,” Tucker says. “So we’re making sure that both students that are looking to enter the field and current workers have access to the training they need.”",https://d3ggs9wi9hwg8r.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/29095958/ev-lab-1-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-29 11:24:34.983624

Earth’s vital signs are “flashing red,” fossil fuel use is at peak levels and warming is increasingly impacting forests, oceans and disaster frequency, according to a new report.

The annual “State of the Climate” report, led by the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research and Oregon State University, was published today in the Biosphere journal and paints a dire picture. It finds 22 of the planet’s 34 key vital signs — such as forest loss, energy consumption, greenhouse gas emissions, fossil fuel subsidies and meat production — are at record levels or trending in the wrong direction. It also points out that 2024 was officially the hottest year on record and likely the hottest in the last 125,000 years.

“We are hurtling toward climate chaos. The consequences of human-driven alterations of the climate are no longer future threats but are here now,” the authors wrote. “The window to prevent the worst outcomes is rapidly closing.”

“We are hurtling toward climate chaos.” – State of the Climate report

In addition to global temperatures, the report finds several other troubling climate-related records broken. For example, tree cover loss due to wildfires reached an all-time high in 2024, with fires in tropical forests alone up 370% over 2023. Atmospheric carbon dioxide is at a record level in 2025 so far. In addition, the total thermal energy stored in oceans is at record highs and contributed to the largest coral bleaching event ever recorded that took place from January 2023 to April 2025 and affected 84% of the world’s coral reefs.

Sea ice is rapidly melting and the report finds ice masses in Greenland and Antarctica are at record lows and “may be passing tipping points, potentially committing the planet to meters of sea-level rise,” according to the report.

“The last few years have seen vital signs breaking their records by extraordinary margins, like surface temperature, ocean heat content, sea ice loss and fire-related tree cover loss,” said Johan Rockström, Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research director and co-author of the report, in a statement.

The impacts go beyond ecosystems: the costs of climate-linked natural disasters since 2000 reached more than $18 trillion globally.

Fossil fuel use

Much of the record-breaking environmental impacts are driven by record-breaking human activities as the population soars to over 8 billion, the report finds. Last year, fossil fuel energy use hit an all-time high, with coal, oil and gas all at peak levels. While solar and wind power consumption also hit record levels, it was more than 30 times lower than fossil fuel consumption.

In 2024, China was the largest estimated fossil fuel greenhouse gas emitter with the US in second, then India, the European Union and Russia — roughly 62% of global fossil fuel emissions came from these countries. The authors warn of a feedback loop with at least some of the increase in fossil fuel electricity generation due to hotter temperatures.

Meat consumption is also at record highs.

The report comes as the US under the Trump administration ignores or denigrates climate science, promotes fossil fuel production and use, eliminates federal climate data and systematically removes federal incentives for renewable energy. In the administration’s boldest attack on climate change regulation, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in July announced its intention to rescind the “endangerment finding,” which would essentially disallow the agency from regulating greenhouse gas emissions.

President Trump called climate change a “con job” at his September speech at the United Nations General Assembly. “All of these predictions made by the United Nations and many others, often for bad reasons, were wrong … if you don’t get away from this green scam, your country is going to fail,” he said.

“We can still limit warming”

The new report found there are still opportunities to limit the worst effects of climate change, saying mitigation strategies are “available, cost effective, and urgently needed.”

“The cost of mitigating climate change is likely far lower than the global economic damages that climate-related impacts could cause,” the report said.

The authors point to land and ocean protections, renewable energy and plant-heavy diets as key to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. For example, wind and solar power could supply almost 70% of global electricity by 2050, eliminating food loss and waste could 8% to 10% of global greenhouse gas emissions annually, and protecting and restoring forests, wetlands, mangroves and peatlands could remove or avoid around 25% of current annual emissions, the authors estimate.

In filmmaker Sasha Wortzel’s feature-length documentary “River of Grass,” the vast ecoregion that spans much of Central and South Florida appears ethereal, otherworldly, nearly dreamlike. Mangrove roots trawl their limbs over and through the muddy gaps where freshwater meets salt. Rivers wend their way down from Lake Okeechobee and through marshlands, lush with grasses and shrubs and those who dine on them. Sunlight coruscates on the water, the contested lifeblood of the Everglades. We hear Wortzel’s voice.

It’s then that we learn the Everglades are dying.

Part love letter to the Everglades, part plea for a reapproach to what’s called “nature,” Wortzel’s “River of Grass” is not a typical environmental documentary. It’s an “invitation,” Wortzel told Prism, one she hopes viewers accept to “connect to the environment [and] to think critically about the long legacies of colonial violence that are shaping our climate realities today.”

“River of Grass” gets its name from the 1947 book by Marjory Stoneman Douglas, a journalist turned environmental activist whose work helped lead to the creation and protection of Florida’s Everglades National Park. Douglas came to Wortzel in a dream and asked the filmmaker to help tell the story of the Everglades, the imperiled beating heart of Florida’s water system. “I had to grant her desire,” Wortzel said.

The first task was to offer a correction. The term “river of grass” did not originate with Douglas, as media reports about the book claimed. Rather, it’s an English translation of the Miccosukee and Seminole people’s placename for the Everglades. In the Miccosukee language, the word kahayatle roughly translates to “shimmering waters.” Betty Osceola, a Miccosukee tribal elder whose spiritual and cultural work with the Everglades grounds much of the documentary, says Douglas might not have meant anything negative by it, but she “stole river of grass.”

And that’s important to acknowledge. As the documentary exposes the manifold threats facing the Everglades, from habitat loss and invasive species to warming ocean waters, “River of Grass” spins around the source of these struggles: the belief that one can, and should, control water. Climate change, a collection of symptoms and rapidly intensifying ecological changes wrought by an economic system predicated on the extraction and burning of fossil fuels, is a consequence of domination. Or put another way: It’s a direct consequence of taking land from Indigenous peoples, calling it by another name, and refusing Indigenous existence is a part of that project.

“River of Grass” attempts to bridge the two versions of the Everglades. There’s the Everglades as enemy: Archival news media clips refer to Lake Okeechobee, the northern source of much of the water that flows south through the Everglades and into the Gulf of Mexico, as monstrous. And there’s the Everglades as relative: Wortzel narrates the lake as the region’s “liquid heart.” We watch as Osceola tells a group taking part in a prayer walk to “listen to the water.” What is the Everglades trying to tell you?

The narrative of the Everglades-as-enemy laid the groundwork for its destruction. In the 1850s, Congress approved the Swamp and Overflowed Lands Act. Chattel slavery and westward expansion were still very much in effect, and federal incentives for states to take on the task of draining and planting land abounded. At the turn of the century, the Army Corps of Engineers, the branch of the military in charge of facilitating large-scale federal and private construction projects, began to channelize the Everglades’ water flow. After a 1928 hurricane caused Lake Okeechobee to overflow its banks—as is part of an organic process of water inundation essential to the health of wetlands—flood channels were constructed to manage water and prevent death from intense weather events. Now, water only has a few artificial corridors through which it can make its way to the ocean.

It’s been 100 years since water was allowed to move freely, and the Everglades’ plant and animal communities have paid the price. Bird species have declined more than 90% since the 1990s. Osceola says in the documentary that hurricanes “sweep” away and clean out the landscape, but these weather events are increasing in frequency and intensity due to changing atmospheric and oceanic conditions. Declining mangrove forests are also losing their ability to buffer the storms. Municipal governments continue to approve development and housing projects nearby or even within the boundaries of the Everglades itself. “River of Grass” also highlights local environmental justice fights: for example, how local governments approve sugarcane burning permits when the wind blows toward Black communities in southern Florida, while refusing permits when the wind is forecasted for white neighborhoods.

Threats come from the federal level as well. In June, the Trump administration opened an immigration detention center in the National Park on land used for military training. The facility, referred to as “Alligator Alcatraz,” made national news for its inhumane conditions, which in August led to the cessation of transfers into the facility. On Sept. 4, an appeals court judge ruled to keep the facility open, despite the many well-documented human rights abuses inside.

The Everglades-as-relative mourns the ecological losses and objects to the mining of the Everglades simply for what it provides. Nine million residents in South Florida are dependent on the Everglades for their drinking water. “It’s cheesy,” Wortzel said. “But we are the Everglades.”

It’s cheesy, but true. The connectedness raises questions about the future of the Everglades and the future of those who drink from its source, and whether one can exist without the other. These are questions both urgent and instructive for this time of climate destruction: How do you love something that’s dying, and can you love it back to life?

Swenja Surminski flew in from London. Vincent Boland came from St. Lucia, navigating through the Caribbean just as Hurricane Melissa passed by. By Friday morning, they’d all gathered at the Carolina Club alongside insurance executives from New York and students who’d spent months researching catastrophe bonds. The question that brought them together: how do you pay for resilience before the next storm hits?

One year ago, Tropical Storm Helene tore through western North Carolina, causing $60 billion in damages, the largest natural disaster in state history. Just weeks before the conference, 12 homes fell into the ocean in Buxton. Insurance Commissioner Mike Causey opened the gathering by making the moment clear. “We have the best beach plan and FAIR plan in the United States,” he said. “What you’ll be talking about this morning is the world’s first climate resilience bond. That is a huge deal.”

UNC School of Law’s daylong conference, “Taking Stock: Climate Resilience and Insurance Finance,” brought together what attendees called one of the largest gatherings on climate resilience and insurance finance ever held at a U.S. university. At its center sat a $600 million bond that does something the insurance world had never seen: it pays investors to fund storm-resistant construction before disasters strike, not just after.

The story starts in 2008. North Carolina faced an insurance crisis. Major insurers fled the state. Carolina Law Professor Don Hornstein, newly appointed to the NC Insurance Underwriting Association (NCIUA) board, had what seemed like a simple idea: insurers shouldn’t just help people recover after disasters. They should invest in preventing damage before storms hit.

Seventeen years of patient work followed. The NCIUA invested over $130 million in resilient construction, funding more than 20,000 FORTIFIED Roofs across North Carolina’s coast, now the largest single-insurer resilience initiative in the world. These aren’t ordinary roofs. They’re engineered to withstand severe storms, and the data proves it. These reinforced roofs cut hurricane damage claims by 35% and weather-related claims by nearly two-thirds.

But the real breakthrough came when Professor Hornstein, who directs Carolina Law’s Center on Climate, Energy, Environment, and Economics (CE3), started asking a bigger question: could you turn that resilience work into a financial product that would generate even more funding? In 2015, he read an academic paper by Shalini Vajjhala, then at the Brookings Institution, proposing exactly that concept. The idea sat there, waiting for someone to build it.

Enter Cory Anger from Guy Carpenter Securities and Tom Beckmerhagen from Hannover Re. Meeting with Hornstein and NCIUA CEO Gina Hardy, they spent months designing the bond’s structure, figuring out how to price resilience, how to attract investors, how to make it work. In early 2025, they took the bond on a road show to investors in London, Zurich, and New York.

The response exceeded everyone’s expectations. The bond raised $600 million, nearly double its original $350 million target. Artemis, the leading publication covering global insurance markets, called it the world’s first insurance-linked security to combine traditional catastrophe protection with a resilience incentive.

Friday’s conference brought the team back together, this time joined by international leaders eager to understand how North Carolina did it. Beckmerhagen, who traveled from Germany to walk through the bond’s technical details, told attendees the model is ready to replicate. “North Carolina can show every other state how to do this,” he said. “Everything was done here: the political will, the transactional features. It’s basically copy and paste for other markets.”

The timing matters. The federal government prepares to announce results of the FEMA Review Council in November, with major cuts to federal disaster assistance expected. President Trump has signaled his intention to shift more responsibility to states, local governments, and the private sector. North Carolina’s model suddenly looks less like an experiment and more like a blueprint for what comes next.

“This is Carolina at its best, applying rigorous research to solve real-world problems that affect millions of people,” Interim Dean Andy Hessick told the packed room.

Swenja Surminski, Managing Director of Climate and Sustainability at Marsh McLennan, spent Thursday with Carolina Law students before addressing the full conference. “What’s happening here in North Carolina is inspirational,” she said. “While every country is grappling with similar challenges, the solutions developed here are showing the rest of the world what’s possible.”

The conversation ranged across continents and innovations. Eric Roberts from The Nature Conservancy presented work on insuring coral reefs in Hawaii for their wave-dampening properties. Vincent Boland from the World Bank shared approaches under development in vulnerable Caribbean nations. Karl Bernier from Swiss Re and James Doona from Munich Re explained parametric insurance, which triggers immediate payouts based on storm intensity rather than waiting months for damage assessments.

Abby Ross, CEO of The Resiliency Company, announced plans to adapt North Carolina’s approach for Los Angeles wildfire recovery, launching a $200 million resilient lending fund. “This can be a new model for financing homes to an insurable resilience standard across the entire country,” she said.

The work has opened doors for Carolina Law students. They worked alongside Professor Hornstein on the bond’s development, conducting research on legal structures and policy frameworks. Their efforts won the school’s Pro Bono Project of the Year award in May 2025. During the conference, as these students watched global experts discuss the bond they’d helped create, Professor Hornstein invited them to stand. “You’re going to be coming to conferences 10 years from now,” he told them.

Kratika Tandon, a second-year law student and co-president of the Environmental Law Program, saw the conference as a window into her future career. “This was an incredible opportunity for students to immerse themselves in the world of reinsurance and understand its role in advancing climate resilience,” she said. “We are deeply grateful to have had the chance to hear from some of the leading voices in this field and gain insight into the impactful, cutting-edge projects that they are driving worldwide.”

Professor Hornstein closed by connecting the conference to Carolina’s broader mission. “This embodies UNC’s mission of applying research to real-world challenges,” he said. “And it shows how North Carolina’s public universities are helping shape global innovations in climate and insurance resilience.”

As the afternoon wound down and attendees filed out of the Carolina Club, the real work was just beginning. The international travelers will head home. The students will return to class. But the blueprint they gathered to study, refined over 17 years from crisis to breakthrough, now stands ready for the next state, the next country, the next storm.",https://law.unc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/HuthPhoto_UNCLaw_ClimateResilienceFinanceInsurance_Leyla_EarlyFavorites_10242025_HUT_9913-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-10-29 11:01:15.623701

This is particularly true for wind and solar projects, which face accelerated deadlines, significant changes to the “beginning of construction” (BOC) rules, and new foreign entity restrictions.

Background

The Inflation Reduction Act created the tech-neutral production tax credit under IRC § 45Y and investment tax credit under IRC § 48E. To qualify, projects had to begin construction before a specific deadline, which taxpayers could establish by meeting either the physical work test or the 5% safe harbor, and then maintain continuity, typically by placing the project in service within four years.

The OBBB dramatically altered this landscape. Among other things, the law imposed an accelerated credit termination date for wind and solar projects – taxpayers now must begin construction before July 4, 2026, to qualify for the full credit. It also introduced significant new foreign entity of concern restrictions.

The IRS followed up with more details in August with Notice 2025-42, which is “very targeted only to the termination of sections 45Y and 48E,” according to Julie Chapel of KPMG, speaking on an October 20 panel of the ABA’s Tax Section. For wind and solar projects beginning construction on or after September 2, 2025, the notice eliminates the 5% safe harbor, except for small projects. “The big headline,” Chapel said, is that developers must now rely on the physical work test. The notice also tightens the continuity requirement for projects that fall outside the four-year safe harbor, imposing a more onerous “continuous program of construction” standard.

A Shift to Facts-and-Circumstances

Eliminating the 5% safe harbor was a direct response to legislative and administrative pressure to end what some lawmakers criticized as overly permissive “shovel in the ground” standards for starting construction, explained ABA panel moderator Ryan Phelps of Holland & Knight. While the new guidance retains the long-standing physical work test, practitioners should anticipate a higher level of scrutiny from the IRS.

“With getting rid of the 5% safe harbor, it is a more holistic test. It’s facts and circumstances,” said KPMG’s Praveen Ayyagari during the panel. He added that “it’s going to really turn on advisors to prove that beginning of construction has actually occurred, using a variety of factors.” Amid the uncertainty, practitioners recommend robust and comprehensive documentation to support a taxpayer’s BOC position.

The Rise of On-Site Work

For years, the industry has heavily favored using off-site manufacturing of components like transformers to establish BOC, panelists noted. However, with the 5% safe harbor gone and manufacturing queues potentially full, a new trend is emerging.

“I do think there’s going to be more and more on-site work being completed to establish BOC over the next year or two,” said Phelps.

On-site work, such as excavating foundations or building access roads, has the advantage of being clearly tied to a specific project, which may be “looked on more favorably under scrutiny,” according to Ayyagari. “I think it might be easier to … meet that facts-and-circumstances test,” he added.

Navigating Pitfalls and Strategies

ABA panelists also offered suggestions for taxpayers and their advisors moving forward in the new energy credit landscape.

Unintentional beginning of construction.

Practitioners must be wary of clients unintentionally starting construction too early, which can jeopardize a project’s timeline for meeting the four-year continuity safe harbor. This often occurs with on-site work. “You’ll have crews out there that are doing site prep … and sometimes they’ll end up constructing a maintenance road,” explained Hannah Hawkins of Deloitte. This can cross the line from preliminary activity into the beginning of physical work. While such mistakes can be fixed, for instance by abandoning and destroying the road, corrections can be expensive and create documentation headaches.

Defective binding written contracts.

For developers still relying on off-site manufacturing, a valid binding, written contract is critical, panelists stressed. “It’s so much harder to sort of reverse engineer yourself into a binding, written contract,” said Hawkins. She recommends having advisors involved “early in the process.” Phelps noted that another common oversight is failing to ensure that agreements with subcontractors also meet the binding written contract requirements, which can invalidate the entire BOC strategy.

Failing the continuity requirement.

For projects at risk of missing the four-year continuity safe harbor, the new, stricter “continuous program of construction” standard presents a significant hurdle. Unlike the old “continuous efforts” test, this standard requires ongoing physical work of a significant nature. “As early as possible, when I think the company is concerned that they may not be able to meet the safe harbor, … I think that’s the time to start thinking about how to document,” advised Jarrett Jacinto of Deloitte. If a project is at risk, developers should immediately begin documenting all ongoing work and any excusable disruptions to build a robust case, as it is “a lot harder to sort of catch up and to sort of recreate the history.”

Not asking the right questions upfront.

Given the new “facts-and-circumstances world,” Ayyagari stressed that it is “better to ask comprehensive questions at the outset and get tax advisors involved at the beginning of the process.” He also suggests asking clients what has to be customized. “Customized property has less of a risk of being seen as inventory if it’s offsite work,” he noted. Also on the list of questions to ask: Can the item “be somewhat standardized so that it could be used at an alternative site if needed?” This provides flexibility if a project plan changes, he said.

And Ayyagari recommends ensuring clients can enter into a contract in time for the manufacturer to meet the deadline. “It’s crucial to use written, binding contracts prior to the manufacturer’s construction or production.”",https://tax.thomsonreuters.com/news/wp-content/themes/tac/assets/media/favicon.png,N,,2025-10-29 13:10:27.803950

The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) is providing a comprehensive financing package of US$ 142 million (€121 million) for two special-purpose vehicles (SPVs) that will develop Uzbekistan’s and Central Asia’s largest combined solar photovoltaic and battery energy storage project to date.

The two SPVs (ACWA Power Sazagan Solar 1 and ACWA Power Sazagan Solar 2) will be majority owned by ACWA Power – an international developer, investor, co-owner and operator of a portfolio of power-generation and desalinated-water-production plants. The SPVs will be co-owned by Sumitomo Corporation, Shikoku Electric Power Company and Chubu Electric Power Company. The investment marks the first foray into renewable-energy and battery energy storage systems (BESSs) in Uzbekistan by the Japanese investors.

The financing package consists of two senior secured loans. The first loan, of US$ 61 million (€52 million equivalent), will be provided to ACWA Power Sazagan Solar 1 for the development, construction and operation of a 500 MW solar photovoltaic power plant and a 668 MWh BESS in the Samarkand region of Uzbekistan. The second loan, of US$ 81 million (€69 million equivalent), will be made available to ACWA Power Sazagan Solar 2 for the development, construction and operation of a 500 MW solar photovoltaic power plant in the Samarkand region and a 668 MWh BESS in Uzbekistan’s Bukhara region.

The project is expected to be co-financed by the Japan Bank for International Cooperation, Nippon Export and Investment Insurance covered lenders, the Asian Development Bank and Islamic Development Bank. Together, the two SPVs will introduce the largest combined solar photovoltaic (1 GW) and BESS (1,336 MWh) capacity in Uzbekistan and across the region. This unprecedented deployment of BESS capacity will help the grid to mitigate the intermittency of renewable energy sources. The BESS technology will improve grid reliability and flexibility by making additional energy capacity available during periods of peak demand.

The project will contribute to the government’s renewables plan, which is supported by the EBRD and targets the development of 25 GW of solar and wind capacity by 2030.

The hydrogen burned at Scattergood is supposed to be green, meaning it is produced by splitting water molecules through a process called electrolysis.
Hydrogen does not emit planet-warming carbon dioxide when it is burned, unlike natural gas.
The city-run utility says Scattergood’s conversion is integral to L.A.’s goal of reaching 100% renewable energy by 2035.
“This is the final nail in the coffin of natural gas power generation.” L.A.’s ambitions also could be complicated by a shifting federal landscape.","The board of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power on Tuesday approved a controversial plan to convert part of the city’s largest natural gas-fired power plant into one that also can burn hydrogen.

In a 3-0 vote, the DWP board signed off on the final environmental impact report for an $800-million modernization of Units 1 and 2 of the Scattergood Generating Station in Playa Del Rey.

The power plant dates to the late 1950s and both units are legally required to be shut down by the end of 2029. In their place, the DWP will install new combined-cycle turbines that are expected to operate on a mixture of natural gas and at least 30% hydrogen with the ultimate goal of running entirely on hydrogen as more supply becomes available.

The hydrogen burned at Scattergood is supposed to be green, meaning it is produced by splitting water molecules through a process called electrolysis. Hydrogen does not emit planet-warming carbon dioxide when it is burned, unlike natural gas.

The city-run utility says Scattergood’s conversion is integral to L.A.’s goal of reaching 100% renewable energy by 2035.

“This project is critical to LADWP’s clean energy transition as it helps us preserve a key power system asset, meet our clean energy goals, and ensures reliability for our customers,” Senior Assistant General Manager David Hanson said. “The Scattergood modernization project is the No. 1 priority on the power system’s ‘Top 10’ priority list. This project is essential.”

But the plan has many detractors, including a number of local environmental groups who say it will prolong the life of the city’s fossil fuel infrastructure at a moment when L.A. should be investing heavily in more proven clean technologies such as solar, wind and battery energy storage.

“I’m very skeptical that progress looks like maintaining reliance on gas plants,” said Julia Dowell, a senior campaign organizer with the Sierra Club. “When this project initially comes online, there likely won’t actually be any hydrogen in the mix, so we’ll still just be burning 100% methane for potentially an indeterminable amount of time.”

Nearly 50 people spoke up at Tuesday’s meeting, with detractors also expressing concerns about water use and pollution from burning the gas. While burning hydrogen does not produce CO2, the high-temperature combustion process can emit nitrogen oxides, or NOx, a key component of smog.

“For the communities living near these power plants, it’s really an environmental justice issue,” Dowell said.

Officials noted that the plan does not call for DWP to produce any of its own hydrogen, but rather to purchase green hydrogen from other suppliers. Upgrading the units now will mean DWP is “ready to go” if and when hydrogen becomes available, said Jason Rondou, DWP’s assistant general manager of power planning and operations.

“What we want to do is make sure that when hydrogen infrastructure is available, that we don’t have an obsolete unit — that we have a unit that is hydrogen-ready,” Rondou told The Times. He said the units wouldn’t be fired up often, but will ensure there’s enough local power during peak periods such as heat waves and wildfires.

However, the approved plan contains no specifics about where the hydrogen will come from or how it will get to the site. “The green hydrogen that would supply the proposed project has not yet been identified,” the environmental report says.

Industry experts and officials said the project will help drive the necessary hydrogen production.

“It gives developers, investors and communities confidence that Los Angeles is ready to lead on clean hydrogen at scale,” said Lorraine Paskett, chief operating officer of First Public Hydrogen Authority, a newly formed group of public agencies in California, including the cities of Lancaster, Industry, Montebello and Fresno, geared toward advancing sustainable hydrogen.

Paul Browning, a former executive in the gas turbine industry at companies such as Mitsubishi and GE Vernova, said wind, solar, hydropower and battery storage are all essential for moving away from natural gas, “but you can’t finish the job without green hydrogen or some other long-duration energy storage technology.”

“There’s some people who are a little bit worried that Scattergood and green hydrogen is a way to perpetuate the use of natural gas — I would just advise you it’s exactly the opposite,” Browning said. “This is the final nail in the coffin of natural gas power generation.”

L.A.’s ambitions also could be complicated by a shifting federal landscape. While President Trump initially seemed supportive of hydrogen as a source of American energy, his administration recently shortened deadlines for hydrogen tax credits and canceled billions in funding for hydrogen projects in the U.S. — including a $1.2-billion award for a major “hydrogen hub” in California known as the Alliance for Renewable Clean Hydrogen Energy Systems, or ARCHES.

The Scattergood conversion was set to receive about $100 million in ARCHES funding. DWP said it is pressing on despite the cut, and that the project is fully budgeted through the utility’s power fund.

But Theo Caretta, an attorney with the nonprofit Communities for a Better Environment, said the $800-million price tag is several years outdated and likely an underestimation of what the project will cost ratepayers. The price of turbines alone has increased under Trump’s tariffs on imported goods, steel and aluminum.

He and other opponents said they would prefer to see DWP invest in renewable technologies that are already on the grid, such as solar and battery storage, demand response and distributed energy resources.

“One main environmental concern is that this project will simply end up just being a methane turbine — that LADWP will not be able to get hydrogen to the plant at a cost that makes sense for their operations, and this will just have been an $800-million project to reinvest in burning methane for decades to come,” Caretta said.

The utility said it is implementing many of the renewable technologies Caretta and others want through different projects such as the Eland solar and battery plant that recently went online in Kern County and is now flowing through the city’s grid.

Officials also pointed to a National Renewable Energy Laboratory analysis that concluded it is “difficult to identify economically viable and deployable alternatives to new combustion resources at the Scattergood location” given the deadline and need to maintain power reliability.

The analysis builds on the findings of the L.A. 100 study, a seminal report published in 2021 that outlined the city’s pathway to 100% clean energy, which identified green hydrogen as a potentially critical component of the city’s portfolio, particularly at times when wind and solar are insufficient to meet demand.

“It’s a good plan,” Jack Brouwer, director of the Clean Energy Institute at UC Irvine who served on the advisory board for the L.A. 100 study, said in a phone call ahead of Tuesday’s vote. “The Scattergood facility and some of the other coastal plants are part of the required infrastructure to enable L.A. 100 to become completely decarbonized and depolluted. It’s not even possible to do this without something there.”

However, Brouwer said he also would have liked to see an alternative plan that used hydrogen fuel cells — a more expensive option that would not produce NOx emissions.

“DWP is known around the world now as a leader in decarbonization, and their progress to date has been tremendous,” Brouwer said. “The whole world is watching.”

Indeed, the stakes are high for DWP to get Scattergood right. The city is operating at about 60% clean energy, and next month it will stop receiving electricity from the Intermountain Power Plant in Central Utah — effectively ending L.A.’s reliance on coal.

“The continued extensive public comment today — both in support and against this project — does show clearly how complex and challenging this transition to clean energy is,” DWP commissioner Nurit Katz during the meeting. “And the challenges that are still ahead of us as we address reliability, resilience, and equity and environmental concerns.”

But, the order also clarified that in its rate-regulating duties, the commission will take into consideration whether Rocky Mountain Power evaluated projects that are eligible for the tax incentives — and that Rocky Mountain Power must “responsibly and prudently evaluate” these limited-time opportunities to keep energy costs low.

“While the (public service commission) has no authority to dictate RMP’s resource procurement decisions, the reasonableness of RMP’s actions in evaluating and acting on any time-sensitive opportunities may certainly be a material factor in future rate proceedings,” the commission wrote.

Any requests by Rocky Mountain Power to expedite applications to procure resources that may qualify for preferential tax treatment in a limited time will be granted, according to the order.

The commission may have denied the request, but it also started a conversation before it was too late to capture the incentives, Logan Mitchell, climate scientist and energy analyst at Utah Clean Energy said.

“In some ways this is almost the best outcome,” Mitchell said. “They’re saying ‘hey, we expect you guys to do your job and take advantage of opportunities for ratepayers to build resources.’”

Request to PacifiCorp to accelerate clean energy developments could save ratepayers millions

Mitchell also highlighted that Utah Clean Energy’s request didn’t ask the utility to procure extra resources it didn’t need, but to use generation included in the company’s resource plan.

“These are things that they’re planning to build anyway, and the question is whether or not we’ll get tax credits with them or not,” Mitchell said.

According to Rocky Mountain Power, that’s something the company could figure out through bilateral negotiations without this process, the utility said in a comment asking the commission to deny the advocates’ request.

The utility also said that its regional resource planning assumed the end of tax subsidies for renewables, which resulted in the removal of over 3,700 MW of wind, 3,366 MW of solar and 2,382 MW of storage from their plan.

“This shows that since the Company does not need new resources to serve Utah customers, rapid procurement of resources, even if they are tax-advantaged, will impose unnecessary costs on Utah customers,” the company wrote.

A conversation starter

States like Colorado and Arizona have issued executive orders aiming to fast-track the procurement processes of new clean energy projects before the federal incentives end, so the clean energy advocates wanted to ensure Utah was also having similar debates.

Especially, Mitchell said, since the organization has kept in touch with developers with existing projects that could reach agreements with Rocky Mountain Power for either development, or to purchase power.

State entities, like the Office of Consumer Services, commended Utah Clean Energy’s effort to capture the federal benefits. However, the office doesn’t believe that parties have adequate resources to participate in the proposal because of their current and upcoming regulatory workload.

“As an alternative, the (Office of Consumer Services) recommends that PacifiCorp identify shovel ready projects and bring them before the PSC under the waiver provision of the Utah Energy Resource Procurement Act,” the office wrote in a comment.

Interwest Energy Alliance, a trade association representing clean energy developers, said in a comment that “given the revised IRS guidance requiring a project to ‘commence construction,’ (before July, 2026) there is now a finite pool of available projects and development resources with a clear pathway to satisfying revised tax credit eligibility requirements and deadlines.”

Therefore, processes must be expedited if the state wants to benefit from the outgoing tax incentives, according to the association.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-47642/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/073124_emery-county-solar_04-1024x6831761739636.jpg?h=199d8c1f&itok=G3ea0tdW,N,,2025-10-29 12:07:24.577534

What Causes a Purge Injection wells shoot oil field wastewater back underground at high pressure.
Despite his urging, the oil division did not pursue court cases against companies, even as the crisis seemed to be worsening.","In January 2020, Danny Ray started a complicated job with the Oklahoma agency that regulates oil and gas. The petroleum engineer who’d spent more than 40 years in the oil fields had been hired to help address a spreading problem, one that state regulators did not fully understand.

The year prior, toxic water had poured out of the ground — thousands of gallons per day — for months near the small town of Kingfisher, spreading across acres of farmland, killing crops and trees.

Such pollution events were not new, but they were occurring with increasing frequency across the state. By the time Ray joined the Oklahoma Corporation Commission, the incidents had grown common enough to earn a nickname — purges.

When oil and gas are pumped from the ground, they come up with briny fluid called “produced water,” many times saltier than the sea and laden with chemicals, including some that cause cancer. Most of this toxic water is shot back underground using what are known as injection wells.

Wastewater injection had been happening in Oklahoma for 80 years, but something was driving the growing number of purges. Ray and his colleagues in the oil division set out to find the cause. As they scoured well records and years of data, they zeroed in on a significant clue: The purges were occurring near wells where companies were injecting oil field wastewater at excessively high pressure, high enough to crack rock deep underground and allow the waste to travel uncontrolled for miles.

What Causes a Purge

Injection wells shoot oil field wastewater back underground at high pressure. This can fracture a hard layer of rock meant to contain the fluid. It can also push wastewater up through Oklahoma’s large number of inactive wells that have not been properly plugged with cement.

By November 2020, at least 10 sites were expelling polluted water, according to internal agency emails obtained through public records requests.

The number of purges has grown steadily since. A Frontier and ProPublica analysis of pollution complaints submitted to the agency found more than 150 reports of purges in the past five years. Throughout that time, state officials were aware of the environmental and public health crisis as Ray and others at the agency investigated the proliferating purges and uncovered a complex stew of causes.

Ray often likens his home state, where oil has been drilled for more than a century and is a major industry, to a block of Swiss cheese, punctured with the nation’s second-highest number of “orphan” wells — inactive wells whose owners have abandoned them without properly plugging them with cement. The state has catalogued about 20,000 orphan wells, but federal researchers believe the true number may be over 300,000, based on historic industry data and airborne imaging techniques that identify old wells underground. These old wells provide easy pathways for the injected wastewater to zoom up thousands of feet to the surface, contaminating drinking water sources along the way.

Ray particularly worried about the volume of wastewater being crammed underground by high-pressure injection — tens of billions of gallons each year, enough to fill the Empire State Building over 300 times. Oklahoma’s vast landscape of unplugged holes combined with its large number of injection wells operating at high pressures creates conditions ripe for purges.

Number of Injection Wells in Top Oil-Producing States

Oklahoma has the third-largest number of injection wells in the country, much more than other prolific oil states, because of its long history of oil and gas extraction and distinct geology.

But Ray would come to learn that at the commission, identifying the causes of the purges was one thing. Stopping them — and preventing new ones — was a very different matter.

“I don’t know if we’re ever going to fix it or not,” said Ray, 72, who resigned in frustration three years later. “They don’t want to listen.”

A yearlong investigation by The Frontier and ProPublica reveals that the Oklahoma Corporation Commission did not mandate that responsible companies clean up the pollution belowground, as state law requires “when feasible.” Regulators say that once tainted by oil field brine, polluted groundwater is virtually impossible to treat. That makes preventing purges all the more critical — something the commission also failed to do, according to current and former employees. At times, records show, agency leadership sidelined employees who criticized the agency’s response.

Field reports from agency staff referred to individual incidents as “a threat to the environment and the safety of persons” or “a hazard to the ground water.” These notes describe orphan wells spewing toxic water near homes or into streams, leaving scars of salt residue. A homeowner reported that his grandchildren often play near a purging well. Ranchers have lost calves, which, drawn to the salty water, died after drinking it. But the full scale of Oklahoma’s purge problem — and state regulators’ awareness of it — has never previously been reported.

Officials with the agency’s oil division acknowledged in an interview with The Frontier and ProPublica that overpressurized wells are contributing to the purges. They say some of these incidents are a result of historic pollution in a state where oil and gas was extracted long before modern regulations, beginning in the 1960s, required companies to protect the environment and plug inactive wells with cement. They noted that the state has taken steps to reduce injection pressures on new wells in recent years and is committed to “doing the right thing, holding operators accountable, protecting Oklahoma and its resources, and providing fair and balanced regulation.”

“I am also confident that every employee and every view is heard and considered,” said Brandy Wreath, who as director of administration for the commission is responsible for the agency’s operations, in a follow-up statement. “We will continue to be committed to protecting Oklahoma and supporting the state’s largest industry to perform its role in a safe and economic manner. These goals are not mutually exclusive.”

To Ray, those efforts were not enough in the face of a much bigger problem. If thousands of gallons of water was reaching the surface, he reasoned, that meant an incalculably greater amount was dispersing below ground. The thought scared him. Oklahoma relies on groundwater for over half of its annual water use.

“We have so much damage underground that we don’t even know about,” Ray said.

State Regulatory Failures

State regulators have direct authority over the pressure at which companies inject oil field wastewater.

But while investigating purges over the last five years, oil division employees have found hundreds of wells that were injecting more fluid than their permits allowed or at pressures above the legal limit, as indicated by the pressure gauge on each well and regular reports from companies to the state. During his tenure, Ray and others also discovered purges caused by wells operating within the pressure boundaries noted on the well permits. Oklahoma’s rules, they concluded, were part of the problem.

In a November 2020 email to a handful of employees, Mike McGinnis, deputy director of the oil division, described an abundance of overpressurized wells near a purge as “self-inflicted.”

“It looks like some of the approved injection pressures were set high in the permit,” he wrote. “May be hard to put that genie back in the bottle.”

Reducing permitted injection pressures was exactly the solution Ray felt was necessary.

The state approves the pressure at which companies can inject oil field wastewater based on whether injection would fracture a hard layer of rock meant to contain the fluid. Ray believed purges could be prevented by lowering pressure limits to the point where injection would not crack the softer sandy layers where most oil and gas is found.

Soon after starting his job, Ray began distributing long memos and dizzying equations calculating the pressure at which different rock formations break.

Ray’s efforts helped yield some short-term success. As new purges emerged and existing ones continued to flow, oil division officials in 2020 lowered injection pressures on a case-by-case basis. Regulators added layers of scrutiny for proposed injection wells and more frequently asked for maps showing wells that the pressurized water might collide with as well as data on the pressure at which rocks crack, according to agency officials.

But lowering injection pressures across the state proved impossible. In meetings, oil and gas industry representatives pushed back on proposed rule changes that Ray considered incremental. That same year, he had proposed a rule that would significantly reduce injection pressures statewide to Robyn Strickland, the oil division director at the time. Ray said Strickland cut him out of subsequent rule meetings.

“I never got an invitation to go back,” he said.

Strickland did not respond to requests for comment.

As 2020 came to a close, several purges in oil fields roughly 2 miles outside the small town of Velma in southwestern Oklahoma made the pressure problem impossible to ignore. Old wells were regularly expelling toxic salt water, one at a rate of 12,600 gallons per day, roughly enough to fill a backyard swimming pool.

Ray and other members of the oil division discovered that some nearby wells had been injecting at pressures that were too high or were shooting more wastewater into the earth than legally allowed, according to agency emails.

The owner of the injection wells, Citation Oil and Gas Corp., one of the largest operators in Oklahoma, agreed to plug some of the purging wells. Ray likened this approach to “Whac-A-Mole”: With so much injected water underground, plugging a few old wells wouldn’t reduce the likelihood of purges; the water would simply find a new outlet.

Citation did not answer questions about the Velma purge.

The agency reduced injection pressures for some of Citation’s wells and temporarily shut down others, but Ray believed that to permanently stop the purge, all injection near Velma needed to be halted indefinitely so the amount of fluid and pressure that had built up underground could be lowered over time. But he said his bosses didn’t agree and, in the Velma case and subsequent purges, allowed companies to continue injecting — or to restart after a short pause — at times near active purges.

“They would say things in our meetings, like, ‘Well, the operators might not go for that,’” Ray said.

“Hell, you’re supposed to be regulators.”

Wreath denied that the agency was overly lenient with oil companies and said that Ray advocated for changes that the oil division could not implement on its own.

“Danny may not have gotten things as fast as he wanted to, but he was heard,” Wreath said. “People were working on it and doing what they needed to do to do it properly and legally. We just don’t have the big stick of government to walk out and say, ‘Boom, you’ve got to start doing this.’”

Charles Teacle III, regulatory affairs chairman for the Oklahoma Energy Producers Alliance, an industry group, said most purges “tend to occur in areas that have a very long history of historical practices that do not represent how the industry operates today.” He did not specify which practices companies no longer engage in. Teacle said that when purges can be connected to a particular company, regulators work with the company to “develop a plan to address it and allow the operator to resume operations if possible.”

Several of the recent purges threatened to violate federal clean water laws, according to Environmental Protection Agency reports, so federal officials began conducting field inspections alongside state oil division employees. The EPA regional office in Dallas noted in a 2020 review of Oklahoma’s injection regulations that “inappropriate” injection appeared to add “pressure to an already over-pressurized system.”

The following year, Ray took his complaints about his agency’s injection pressure regulations to the EPA.

“I have been trying for more than a year to convince everyone that this is a major problem in Oklahoma,” he wrote in a memo to the head of the EPA’s regional office.

The EPA did not respond to questions.

In August 2022, the Velma purge exploded to the surface again, more than a year after the agency’s initial investigation began. Thousands of gallons of oil field wastewater poured down a forested hillside, forming a “field” of water and flowing into a creek, according to an email from an agency employee. The agency discovered the fluid was 56 times more concentrated with salts and chemicals than the EPA’s standard for drinking water.

This time, oil division officials shut down all nearby injection. But a week later, wastewater flowed out of the ground at an even faster rate, a result of the pressure that had built up over time. A week after that, a mile away, another purge began.

As before, Ray chafed at what he saw as the agency’s reactive stance.

If an across-the-board pressure reduction was impossible, Ray hoped that the oil division would wield one of its available tools: legal action against companies creating the pollution. The oil division could take companies to the Oklahoma Corporation Commission’s administrative law courts, where judges could issue rulings that fine companies or enforce cleanups, as long as the three elected commissioners approved.

Agency leadership appeared to support this strategy. In an October 2022 email, field operations manager Brad Ice wrote that if pollution were found, the agency would order the company to halt injection and take steps to clean the area. And if the company disagreed or pollution continued, the agency would “file contempt for failure to prevent pollution” against the company.

But no contempt cases have been filed for purges in the last five years, according to commission spokesperson Trey Davis. Nor has the agency fined any companies for purges during that time, he said.

Davis identified two cases in administrative law court during that time in which the agency formally ordered companies to stop injection after a purge and to clean up the pollution — though he said the commission prefers “to lead with a handshake instead of a hammer.”

Despite creating purges, companies did not face punishment if they subsequently complied with agency requests to shut down injection wells, pump wastewater off the surface and restore the landscape, Davis and other agency officials said.

“We’re not a fine-driven agency,” said Wreath, adding that extended injection well shutdowns cut into oil company profits, making additional fines unnecessary. He noted that pursuing enforcement can take longer and cost taxpayers more than getting companies to cooperate voluntarily.

That cooperation, however, almost never involves cleanup of water resources tainted by purges. Oil division officials were able to identify just one time since 2020 that their agency approved a plan to clean up groundwater pollution caused by a purge. Removing pollution from underground water sources is incredibly difficult and very expensive, McGinnis, the agency’s deputy director, said.

By the fall of 2022, other agency staff had begun voicing frustration at what they perceived as the commission’s lack of action.

“I believe it is unconscionably reckless on our part as a regulatory agency not to act swiftly, while knowingly and willingly allowing the continued operation of activities under our jurisdictional control that are contaminating groundwater and presenting a potential endangerment to the health and safety of persons and the environment,” wrote Everett Plummer, at the time a supervisor at the agency’s oil division, in an October 2022 email to another supervisor that was forwarded to Ray and agency leaders, including Strickland.

“We are not addressing the root cause of the problem,” Plummer went on in the same email. “That root cause is overpressure.”

Less than a year later, Plummer sent another email, this time to Ray and another colleague, lamenting that Strickland and other agency leaders “won’t offer any help or technical input or solutions.”

Neither Strickland nor an agency spokesperson responded to requests for comment on Plummer’s email. Plummer declined to be interviewed for this story.

Some oil and gas companies know when their injection wells are operating at excess pressure and fracturing rock, allowing toxic water to disperse below ground, in violation of state standards, according to a hydrogeologist who worked in saltwater disposal for a large Oklahoma oil company. He pointed to wells he had worked on that were injecting 10,000 barrels of wastewater a day — more than the rock layer should be able to absorb. “You’re thinking, ‘Damn, where is it all going?’” he said.

The hydrogeologist, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he still works in the industry and fears repercussions, said he worries the result is pollution the state doesn’t know about — until it breaks the surface.

“It was so disheartening to me,” he said, “because you should be able to go to OCC to actually address this stuff.”

Toxic Drinking Water

As Ray pushed his agency to respond more urgently to the purges, oil field wastewater was seeping into aquifers and drinking water sources scattered across the state.

In 2021, John Roberts, who works as an oil field pump truck driver, and his wife, Misty, asked the state to test their water. They live near the 500-person town of Cement in southwestern Oklahoma, where a series of purges encircled the town for nearly four years. One gushed a few hundred feet from the high school, just beyond the softball diamond.

For residents whose private water wells pulled from the local groundwater, these purges posed severe health risks in addition to killing grass and other vegetation on their land. When the state tested water from the Roberts’ well, samples showed levels of salts well above the EPA’s recommended maximum. Their well water also contained benzene, a notorious carcinogen linked to leukemia and other blood cell cancers, at six times the EPA’s limit for drinking water.

Subsequent agency investigations near Cement found a tangle of problems. Several wells were injecting at pressures far beyond the fracture point of the rock. A study commissioned by the state found that, within a few square miles, 22 of 28 injection wells were operating at pressures outside legal limits, were injecting into the wrong geologic formation and potentially causing cracks, or had an incomplete permit.

These wells were also injecting near more than 100 old wells that had been plugged with mud. Unlike a proper cement plug, mud is not strong enough to prevent the pressurized fluid from bursting out of the well.

Many of the injection wells were again owned by Citation, whose high-pressure injection had been shut down by the agency near the Velma purge about 60 miles away. Company representatives downplayed the number of purges, referring to them as “alleged” in emails to the agency. They maintained that the pollution was a remnant of historic oil and gas activity. But agency engineers pulled well records and field staff tracked oil field wastewater flowing less than a half mile from a church and a Dollar General on the edge of town. The state report analyzed water samples and injection data and found that the cause was overpressurized injection.

In 2023, the Robertses sued Citation in federal district court, alleging that the company’s injection was causing “new pollution and contamination on a daily basis.” Citation denied the allegations and argued that the case ought to first be decided by the commission’s administrative law court. The federal lawsuit is on hold until the administrative case with the Oklahoma Corporation Commission concludes.

Misty Roberts told The Frontier and ProPublica that the couple has installed filtration systems, which require upkeep to keep toxic chemicals out of their drinking water. “It’s a headache just knowing that if our filters get bad, it could come through if we don’t get them changed in time,” she said.

She said that Citation recommended that they pay to hook up to city water, but their neighbor refused to offer them an easement to dig a water line.

The company did not answer questions about the lawsuit.

“Citation Oil & Gas Corp. continues to work cooperatively with the OCC to further investigate the sources and causes of these alleged purges,” Bob Redweik, the company’s vice president of environmental health and safety and regulatory affairs, said in a statement.

The oil and gas industry’s toxic legacy can endure long after production has ceased.

For rancher Tim Ramsey, the pastures where he runs cattle in northeastern Oklahoma are littered with orphan oil and gas wells. Hiding in the tall grass or shaded by stands of oak and elm, many of the wells are leaking oil. Others regularly purged oil field brine. One, according to Ramsey, periodically blasted salt water and oil 40 feet into the air with a loud “SHHHH” sound. Ramsey has been submitting cleanup requests to the state for years. The state plugged the purging well last winter, but many more unplugged wells remain, according to state data.

The 67-year-old spent decades as a coal miner. The oil industry’s pollution angers him. Regulators’ failure to prevent that pollution angers him even more. He described the state as “so slow at doing anything.”

“My biggest beef,” he said, “is why did you let them get away with it to begin with?”

Similar disappointment ate at Ray in his final months at the Oklahoma Corporation Commission. Despite his urging, the oil division did not pursue court cases against companies, even as the crisis seemed to be worsening. In spring 2023, he said he reviewed an internal spreadsheet identifying 42 purges, most of which were still actively flowing.

By August 2023, Ray had had enough and resigned.

An Enduring Crisis

Around the time of Ray’s departure from the agency, the oil division hired a prominent environmental consulting firm, Halff, to help settle disputes among its employees on how the state should respond to the purges.

The Frontier and ProPublica reviewed reports prepared by the firm about major purges. In each one, they had drawn the same conclusion as Ray: Overpressurized injection wells were causing purges, a dynamic intensified by the number of orphan wells and years of lax regulation, according to the reports.

But tensions remained. Shawn Coslett, manager of the pollution abatement division, became increasingly vocal about what he called a “culture problem” within the commission when it came to holding companies accountable for pollution, according to emails he sent to his managers and other colleagues.

Since 2023, Coslett had been pushing the agency to pursue Citation in court for its role in a major purge outside Ardmore that gushed wastewater on and off for years. In May 2024, Citation’s vice president of environmental health and safety emailed his team to let them know that Ice, the agency’s field operations director, agreed to hold a meeting between the company and the agency’s oil division with “limited attendance.”

“Shawn Coslett and his team would not be invited,” Redweik wrote.

The role of Coslett’s team in the purge investigation was subsequently reduced, according to internal documents. The agency marked the purge as “resolved” in April 2025.

Coslett declined to be interviewed for this story. Neither Ice nor Redweik responded to questions about Coslett’s work on the Ardmore purge.

Last December, Coslett also urged the agency in several emails to take action on a purge expelling 1,300 gallons of salt water daily on Choctaw Nation land in southeastern Oklahoma. It had been flowing intermittently for four years.

Coslett wanted the agency to create a sampling plan for barium, which had been found in the purging water at high levels, as well as other metals. In a December email to an oil division manager, he wrote that runoff from the site could eventually make its way into the headwaters of Lake Wister, a public water supply that serves tens of thousands of people.

The oil division did attempt to make some changes. In closed meetings with industry representatives last year, agency officials suggested requiring companies to test the fracture point for each injection well — exactly what Ray had recommended years before. But industry groups vigorously opposed the idea, agency officials told The Frontier and ProPublica, and it was not included in the formal proposal to change state rules for injection pressure that the agency submitted to the commissioners last September.

In January, the commission ultimately approved a revised formula to calculate maximum injection pressures. But the new rules, effective this month, only apply to new wells. Retroactively reducing pressures would require action by the state Legislature. The higher pressures for Oklahoma’s more than 10,400 existing injection wells remain unchanged, allowing the problem that Ray identified to persist.

Coslett left the agency in March. Two weeks later, a new director arrived to lead the oil division: Jeremy Hodges, a former financial analyst and project manager for Continental Resources, the Oklahoma City-based oil and gas giant. He replaced Strickland, who recently took a job as chief projects officer for the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission, a quasi-governmental organization that often advocates for industry interests.

In the weeks immediately before and after Hodges took over the oil division, the agency marked nearly 20 purge cases as “resolved,” including some of the most damaging and persistent pollution events, according to the agency’s database of pollution complaints.

In a September public meeting, Hodges sought to reassure the agency’s commissioners: Purges were under control, he said.

But interviews with current and former agency staff and oil and gas officials suggest that Oklahoma is still dealing with dozens of purges. One of these incidents killed about two dozen cattle in September after toxic salt water filled a creek leading to Fort Cobb Lake, a public water supply. That month, the state increased testing at the lake and said the public supply has not been impacted. Nevertheless, in October Gov. Kevin Stitt declared a state of emergency and called it “a serious threat to public health and safety” as thousands of gallons of wastewater continued to flow each day.

Agency officials said field staff periodically check for signs of new activity at purge sites that they considered resolved. They did not comment on the purges near Lake Wister or Fort Cobb Lake. Hodges, who participated in an interview with The Frontier and ProPublica, did not provide comment beyond what other agency officials said.

In late August, Ray, who has returned to consulting for oil and gas companies, took a reporter to visit a purge site on a ranch in southern Oklahoma where the agency had closed a pollution complaint around the time Hodges took office.

That afternoon, in an otherwise dry streambed flanked by steep red-dirt walls, puddles sat baking in the sun, though it hadn’t rained in weeks. A film of oil shone on the water’s surface, bands of green mixed with purple and bright blue. On the banks, white salt scars showed the outline of old wastewater spills.

“It is hard to believe that anyone would turn their back on this problem and just pretend it simply does not exist,” Ray said as he surveyed the scene.

Farther up the gulch, the water formed a pool, which gave off a rank chemical smell. The oily surface appeared calm at first glance. But on closer inspection, bubbles were breaking the surface in several places. The water was coming up from beneath the ground.",https://www.propublica.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/X_OK-purges-109-OG_preview_maxWidth_3000_maxHeight_3000_ppi_72_embedColorProfile_true_quality_95.jpg?w=1200,N,,2025-10-29 12:06:56.108139

Some believe that the practice does a good job of weeding out invasive species and creating healther ecosystems.

Others say that humans should not interfere in forest growth and instead take a hands off approach.

Black gums and sycamores peek out alongside winding forest roads in southern Indiana while beech and maple trees shoot up in the understory of older, taller oaks. Local forests are growing shadier, denser and diverse.

For some Hoosiers, this mosaic of native species is the natural next phase of life for Indiana forests. Others interpret the mix as a warning.

The question of how to manage Indiana's forests sparks some of the livelier and more contentious debates among local environmentalists. Many Midwestern forest managers want to utilize prescribed burning to root out invasive species, prevent wildfires and move forests toward what they see as ideal conditions. Some are already doing so.

Environmentalists currently are divided over whether to bring fire back in places like the Hoosier National Forest, state owned properties and private land operated by trusts or organizations like The Nature Conservancy.

Already the United States Forest Service and The Nature Conservancy use pre-planned, controlled burns set by professionals to alter the array of plants in Indiana ecosystems. The fires can burn off invasive plants or unwanted species and redirect ecosystems toward supporting native flora and fauna. Advocates say the practice, done in concert with other management techniques like cutting certain trees to thin out the forest floor, can help restore and maintain ecosystems comprised of fire-tolerant oak trees.

“If a prescribed fire is done well, it's boring,” said Allen Pursell, the director of forest programs for the Sam Shine Foundation, a conservation non-profit in Greenville, Indiana. Controlled burns, which are typically safe, are a different entity than wildfires.

Yet, some environmentalists, who believe that forests should be left to their own devices, have in recent years mounted a protest against intensive forest management techniques like prescribed burning.

The United States Forest Service’s management of Hoosier National Forest, which includes plans to log and burn thousands of acres in the Houston South region, has been a particular point of contention among environmentalists. Several lawsuits and protests have arisen in response, and last month, a court order paused all activity related to the project.

Jeff Stant, the former executive director of the Indiana Forest Alliance, has been vocally opposed to prescribed burning and joined the pushback against the USFS. He said he prefers a “hands off” approach to woodland management and wants to see the forest grow and change across generations without human intervention.

Even planned fires kill, he said, whether it’s beech and maple saplings or box turtles and small birds.

Pursell, who favors responsible burning and thinning, doesn’t disagree that it can be painful to watch forests set ablaze and trees falling.

“I’ve never gotten over that,” Pursell said.

“It’s like surgery,” he added. “It always hurts,” but sometimes you’re better off when it's over.

Fire's role in Indiana forests

The practice of prescribed burning is far from new.

Burn scars on old trees and historical records from early European settlers speak to Indiana forests where regular burning took place. Some researchers think that since the last Ice Age Indigenous tribes burned swaths of woodlands to create an environment enticing to game animals.

""This forest literally never existed without human intervention,"" Pursell said.

But human-forest interaction changed drastically over the past couple of centuries. Many eastern hardwood forests were razed for agriculture, and Indiana forests have seen little fire over the past 100 or so years.

The lack of fire drastically altered local ecosystems, according to Kyle Brazil, a wildlife biologist with Central Hardwoods Joint Venture, a network of governmental and non-profit conservation agencies.

In areas that once boasted generations of oak and hickory trees, beech and maple now make up large portions of the midstory. The forest is shadier, and it’s harder for young oaks to survive.

Forests ""have become overgrown with species that normally wouldn't be able to grow there in the presence of fire,"" Brazil said. ""They've become too thick. The formerly open canopies that let the sunshine in and let it get to the ground are now dark.""

Stant, who wants to see Indiana take a hands-off approach to forest management, has a more positive view when he looks out at swaths of the Hoosier National Forest, brimming with an array of different tree species.

“It’s just a menagerie of different hardwood forest types, all mixed in,” Stant said, rattling off more than 20 species including silver maple, American sycamore, beech, black gum, walnut.

“Hands off” management approaches, which largely let woodlands evolve on their own, can result in this kind of species diversity. And in Stant’s eyes, this is a boon for the forest. Areas awash with different tree species have an easier time bouncing back if some trees, like ash or elm, die in the face of invasive pests. Unharmed species can fill the gaps left behind, keeping the ecosystem tumbling along.

Stant also objects to prescribed burning in southern Indiana because it prioritizes two trees in particular: oaks and hickories.

“The forest service is trying to go in here and do a burning program that's designed to kill that sycamore, kill those tulip poplars, kill the beech, kill the sugar maple,” he said.

Some controlled burns are designed to subdue beech and maple, which would otherwise outcompete oak, a shade-averse tree on which Indiana wildlife rely. For many in favor of these prescribed burns, clearing some beech and maple to ensure oak survival is the point.

“The forest has become so dark that while we have a lot of oak canopy trees now, there’s no future of oak,"" Pursell said.

Still, Stant isn’t convinced that forests dominated by oak and hickory trees are healthy for Indiana ecosystems, and he is quick to point out that many of the trees land managers want to see after prescribed burns are lucrative for the timber industry. So he advocates for less human interference.

“We should let nature evolve and respond to it, and let it choose the winners and losers,” he said. “I don't want to live in a world that is so deprived that everything I look at is something that some humans made or picked out. I want to be part of something bigger where I can go explore. What these managers are doing is they are starving us of that.”

Birds, bugs and big, old oak trees

Others fundamentally disagree, noting the long history of human forest management.

“Forests in this part of the world, man has managed them since they arrived. There's never been a time when nature just ran its course,” Brazil said. “Unless you consider that man is a part of nature.”

As humans influenced forest composition with fire since the last Ice Age, the creatures who relied on woodlands thrived, especially birds. Brazil believes that healthy ecosystems result in healthy bird populations.

Right now, many bird populations native to Indiana are shrinking. For example, cerulean warblers, bright blue songbirds, have declined steeply over time. Pursell and Brazil see a connection to forest management in these birds' decline: The warblers, which are endangered in the state of Indiana, heavily favor white oak trees and woodlands with gaps in the canopy.

While cerulean warblers are just one species, the future of their survival in Indiana speaks to the need for biodiverse forests, according to Pursell.

Oak trees, Pursell added, are especially critical for songbirds. Their bark is ridged and furrowed, giving insects room to proliferate. Hungry birds looking for dozens of squirming caterpillars a day to feed their young can easily find the insects on oak trees. Beech trees with their smooth, silvery bark provide fewer hiding spots for bugs.

Studies show that birds like red-bellied woodpeckers, tufted titmouses, blue jays, white breasted nuthatches and as well as a slew of mammals feast on acorns during years in which oaks produce nuts. Many birds steer clear of beech and sugar maple, instead choosing oak trees for nesting.

At Wallow Hollow Woods, a property owned and operated by The Nature Conservancy near Nashville, Indiana, the desire to preserve native songbird habitat persuaded land managers to light prescribed fires and thin the trees.

Two years after the last fire, burned sections of the 73-acre natural area bear charcoal stumps and scars, but the ground is also dappled in sedges and sunlight. While strolling through the property on a recent afternoon, Pursell was quick to point out dozens of small oak saplings, no taller than a couple of feet, peeking up through the earth.

“If we were to lose the oak out of these forests, we know without a shadow of a doubt that there would be a ripple effect in those songbirds that would affect their already declining numbers,” Pursell said. “And we run the risk that it could tip the scale or tip the balance such that some of them could potentially become extinct.”

But beech, maple, sycamore and black gum are also native to Indiana and also support forest ecosystems by providing shelter and protein to a variety of animals.

And at Wallow Hallow Woods, tucked across the ravines and slopes unscathed by fire, beech and maple trees still grow.

“We don't want to lose that either,"" Pursell said.

GTC Washington, D.C.—NVIDIA today announced that the nation’s leading manufacturers, industrial software developers and robotics companies are using NVIDIA Omniverse™ technologies to build state-of-the-art robotic factories and new autonomous collaborative robots to help overcome labor shortages and drive American reindustrialization.

“AI is transforming the world’s factories into intelligent thinking machines — the engines of a new industrial revolution,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “Together with American’s manufacturing leaders, we’re building physical AI, Omniverse digital twins and collaborative robots that will drive productivity, resilience and competitiveness across the U.S. industrial base.”

The Operating System for the Industrial AI Era

NVIDIA announced that it is expanding its “Mega” NVIDIA Omniverse Blueprint for simulating robot fleets to include technologies for designing and simulating factory digital twins.

Siemens is the first company to develop digital twin software that supports the Mega Omniverse Blueprint. Currently in beta testing, the new industrial technology stack will be part of the Siemens Xcelerator platform. It will help engineers design and operate large-scale digital twins of factories that bring together realistic 3D models with live operational data. Built for the AI era, this technology stack enables comprehensive simulation, optimization and real-time performance monitoring that can help design smarter and more efficient factories, products and data centers.

FANUC and Foxconn Fii are among the first robot manufacturers to support 3D, OpenUSD-based digital twins of their robots to make it easy for manufacturers to drag and drop equipment into their digital twins.

In his NVIDIA GTC Washington, D.C., keynote address, Huang showcased how Foxconn is using the new Omniverse technologies to design, simulate and optimize its new 242,287-square-foot facility in Houston, Texas, for manufacturing NVIDIA AI infrastructure systems.

America’s Leaders Build AI-Driven Factories to Accelerate Manufacturing

In 2025, $1.2 trillion in investments toward building out U.S. production capacity was announced — led by electronics providers, pharmaceutical companies and semiconductor manufacturers. The nation’s leading companies are relying on applications from independent software vendors and Omniverse libraries to build robotic factories that can power this wave of industrialization, using physical AI and simulation to accelerate manufacturing.

Belden has implemented Accenture’s Physical AI Orchestrator, which combines NVIDIA Omniverse libraries, the NVIDIA Metropolis platform and agentic AI from Accenture, to create virtual safety fences for instant hazardous zone monitoring and real-time quality-inspection systems in factories and warehouses.

Caterpillar is applying Omniverse to build digital twins of its factories and supply chains, for use in advanced manufacturing capabilities such as predictive maintenance and dynamic scheduling, NVIDIA NIM™ microservices to drive workflow automation and predict and optimize factory maintenance, and NVIDIA cuOpt™ software to optimize supply chain performance.

Lucid Motors is using Omniverse to build digital twins of its factories for real-time factory planning and optimization, as well as to train AI-driven robotics systems. Toyota is using idealworks’ iw.sim technology, which integrates capabilities from the Mega Omniverse Blueprint, to create digital twins of its Georgetown, Kentucky, facility and explore complex automation scenarios.

TSMC is using Omniverse to accelerate fab design and construction, as well as the NVIDIA Isaac™ platform for the development of robotics for specific operations at its Phoenix, Arizona, facility to significantly enhance manufacturing productivity. Wistron is using a suite of NVIDIA AI and Omniverse technologies to implement a rigorous digital testing and validation process for the systems it assembles in its Fort Worth, Texas, facility.

Leading Robot Developers Assemble America’s New Robotic Workforce

Robotics companies are using NVIDIA’s three-computer architecture to build and deploy advanced fleets of robots that will play a critical role in bridging skills gaps, enhancing worker productivity and improving safety across industries.

Figure and NVIDIA announced a collaboration to accelerate next‑generation humanoid robotics. Using NVIDIA accelerated computing to build its Helix vision language action model and the Isaac platform for simulation and training, Figure is rapidly building the world’s most advanced, large‑scale humanoid fleet capable of everything from household chores to industrial support.

Agility Robotics’ general-purpose humanoid, Digit, uses the NVIDIA Isaac Lab framework to refine whole-body control through millions of reinforcement learning scenarios, which accelerate enhancements to its skillsets such as step recovery from environmental disturbances, often needed in highly dynamic areas like manufacturing and logistics facilities. Digit is powered by the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Thor™ module, enabling real-time perception, navigation and autonomous decision-making.

Amazon Robotics is using Omniverse libraries and frameworks to shorten the development of Amazon’s various manipulation systems and mobile robots, which run on the NVIDIA Jetson™ platform, from years to months. Thanks to simulation training, Amazon’s recently announced BlueJay multi-arm manipulator for picking, stowing and consolidating moved from concept to production in just over a year.

Skild AI is building a general-purpose robotics foundation model that spans legged, wheeled and humanoid robots, using Isaac Lab for locomotion and dexterous manipulation tasks training and NVIDIA Cosmos™ world foundation models for generating training datasets. FieldAI is training cross-embodied robot brains for monitoring and inspection in construction and oil and gas environments, using Isaac Lab for reinforcement learning and NVIDIA Isaac Sim™ for synthetic data generation and software-in-the-loop validation.

The Michigan Public Service Commission took public comment Tuesday on guidelines for its integrated resource plan, offering residents a chance to weigh in on the state’s energy future during a hearing at Oakland Community College’s Auburn Hills Campus.

“It’s the spooky season, but the scariest thing in Michigan right now is AI data center’s threat to the Great Lakes state,” said Michelle Martinez, the inaugural director of the Tishman Center for Social Justice and the Environment at the University of Michigan during a rally held ahead of the meeting.

Data centers house servers, storage devices and other pieces of online infrastructure. They are considered essential for artificial intelligence and have contributed to a significant increase in demand for electricity across the nation due to their continuous, energy intensive operations, and similarly demand large amounts of water for cooling.

While the Legislature approved tax incentives for data centers in 2024 in a bid to court investments into Michigan communities, Martinez warned that failing to act will sacrifice water resources, balloon energy costs and risk accelerating climate change.

Martinez pointed to an analysis from Bloomberg News which found that energy prices had increased 267% within five years in areas located near data centers, warning that Michigan communities could face a similar threat, with seniors and people with disabilities particularly at risk.

Christy McGillivray, the executive director of Voters Not Politicians slammed the Legislature for moving forward with incentives for data centers without protections for ratepayers, while Andrea Pierce, the policy director for the Michigan Environmental Justice Coalition warned these facilities could deplete groundwater aquifers and disrupt ecosystems through thermal pollution of surface waters, alongside pollution with PFAS, methane and other harmful chemicals.

“The only way to protect our water is through airtight regulations at every level, including the MPSC,” Pierce said.

Through its integrated resource plan, the Public Service Commission should require utilities to plan within water limits, Pierce said, factoring in cooling water needs, growing demand from various industries and climate-adjusted water scenarios.

The commission’s chair, Dan Scripps spoke with reporters ahead of the meeting. He noted that the commission is currently weighing consumer concerns in a contested case with Consumers Energy intended to protect ratepayers from the additional costs brought on by data centers, telling reporters he expected those issues would be addressed on a utility by utility basis.

When asked what role the commission could play in looking at the water use associated with energy generated for data centers, Scripps said that was not a role the Legislature had given them.

However, when asked about the extent of the commission’s ability to institute air and water protections, Scripps noted there are statutes barring residential, industrial and commercial energy customers from shifting costs from one customer class to another. He also pointed to clean energy laws passed in 2023 – with one law instructing the commission to weigh factors like equity, environmental justice, affordability, public health and more when reviewing energy companies’ operations plans – as another piece of those considerations.

During the hearing, residents continued to raise concerns that a proliferation of data centers would bring additional costs to ratepayers and derail the state’s goal to meet a 100% clean energy standard by 2040.

Mikal Goodman, a member of the Pontiac City Council, stressed the importance of energy affordability and the environmental impact of expanding energy infrastructure, particularly as it affects low income residents and communities of color.

He noted that many Michigan communities still have lead water lines, raising further concerns about the ability of Pontiac and communities like Detroit and Benton Harbor to access clean water should data centers open up nearby.

“If our city of Pontiac is not able to get clean and affordable drinking water on a regular basis, that is a catastrophic outcome beyond the decades of disinvestment that have already happened,” Goodman noted.",https://d14e0irai0gcaa.cloudfront.net/www.miningjournal.net/images/2016/11/15192946/fblike.jpg,N,,2025-10-29 11:01:07.468677

* J.D. Power predicts a 60% EV sales drop in October from September levels.

* Decline follows expiration of federal tax credits that boosted affordability.

* EVs will make up 5.2% of new sales, down from September’s record 12.9%.

=============================================================

There was no getting around the fact that EV sales would take a massive blow without government subsidies. $7,500 is no small amount of cash, and tacking it onto the price of a car will make most vehicles way less appealing.

If J.D. Power is right, the loss of that credit has had an even larger impact on the EV market than many in the industry expected.

How Deep Is The Dip?

The research firm, working with GlobalData, predicts 54,673 EV retail sales for October. If that figure holds, it represents a 43.1 percent decline compared with October 2024, when 96,085 electric vehicles were sold. That would also mean a slide in market share from 8.5 percent to just 5.2 percent.

More: Germany Brings Back EV Incentives To Save Its Auto Industry

That’s a massive drop from the way September went. EVs hit a record 12.9 percent of the market that month, yet if October’s projected 54,673 EV sales come true, it would mark a 59.9 percent drop from September’s 136,211 units.

“The automotive industry is experiencing a significant recalibration in the electric vehicle segment,” said J.D. Power data analyst Tyson Jominy. “The recent EV market correction underscores a critical lesson: Consumers prefer having access to a range of powertrain options.”

Perhaps the wildest bit of this entire thing is that it could’ve been even worse for EVs. Many brands, including Hyundai, GM, and Tesla, rolled out different methods to ease the pain of losing the federal tax credit.

Had they not done those things, like cutting total costs, rolling out new cheaper models, and more… the hit would’ve no doubt been even harder.

Automotive executives also believe the EV market will stabilize and continue to grow over time. Both Ford’s current CEO and former CEO agreed on that point recently. Obviously, only time will tell.

Rising Prices, Fewer Discounts

Another interesting find is that average transaction prices are climbing as the EV share drops. The typical new-vehicle sold in October is expected to hit $46,057, about $1,000 higher than last year. Incentive spending has slipped to $2,674 per vehicle, roughly five percent of MSRP.

Analysts say the pullback in incentives largely stems from fewer EV sales. “EVs usually carry far steeper discounts,” noted one researcher. Average EV discounts rose to $13,161 as brands tried to offset lost tax credits, while non-EV discounts fell to $2,423, helping boost overall profitability despite softer EV demand.

Several auto makers listed their MSRP before the subsidies were announced. Later when the vehicles hit the showroom, I noticed the MSRPs had jumped commensurate with the subsidy. It’s like Target raising the price of something X% before a sale of X% off. If you want a good example of Net Zero, that’s it.

At Hertz rent a car, you choose your own. We got in an SUV, it turned out to be a half-charged EV. We quickly jumped out and got in a gas-powered car. We certainly do not want to be looking around for a charging station in a city we are not familiar with and hanging around for God knows how long charging up an EV.

I own a 2022 model SUV, but 4 months ago bought a tiny 2010 Fiat 500 with little to no electronics - to zip around town.

I find my big SUV can get comparable fuel efficiency to the 12 years older Fiat.

Cars are improving their fuel efficiency and if you add in hybrids, then there may not be such a BIG market for pure play EVs. I think there will still be a market, but not for all cases.

Even with the subsidies these EVs were sold at huge losses for most auto manufacturers. This has been the single biggest factor in the massive price inflation we have seen among ALL vehicles since 2021. These companies ran up their prices on their ICE vehicles just to stay in business.

In a significant step forward for Pakistan’s electric mobility ambitions, the International Finance Corporation (IFC), a member of the World Bank, has provided a grant of US$1.8 million to encourage private sector investment in local electric vehicle (EV) production.

The development comes as part of a broader initiative spearheaded by the Ministry of Industries and Production (MoIP) to formulate a comprehensive policy aimed at accelerating EV adoption in the country. According to the documents available with Wealth Pakistan, a steering committee was established on September 13, 2024, under the Minister for Industries to guide the development of a policy framework promoting the transition to electric mobility.

The committee held multiple rounds of deliberations and created six working groups to focus on key areas such as technology, infrastructure, fiscal incentives, and investment mobilization. According to the document, technical expertise for the policy was provided by a team of specialists led by Dr. Horizon Walker, a globally recognized expert in electric vehicle ecosystems.

The group carried out a critical review of existing policies, analysed lessons from successful international programs, and conducted over 60 consultative sessions with stakeholders from provincial governments, academia, the private sector, and industry associations. By the end of November 2024, the committee had finalized the first draft of the policy, which was soon recognized by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as a key component of Pakistan’s green economic strategy.

The IMF subsequently adopted the EV initiative as a major element of a US$1.4 billion arrangement under the Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF). Secretary of Industries and Production Saif Anjum told the Standing Committee on Finance and Revenue that the IFC grant was a turning point in aligning Pakistan’s industrial policy with global sustainability standards. He said the IFC’s involvement would catalyse local manufacturing, reduce import dependence, and attract more private investment into clean transport technologies.

The policy, backed by both the IMF and IFC, is expected to be rolled out later this year, marking a significant milestone in Pakistan’s transition toward cleaner, more sustainable transportation systems. Beyond the industrial dimension, the EV policy carries strong economic and environmental implications. Under Pakistan’s commitment to the Paris Agreement, the country aims to ensure that 30 percent of all new vehicle sales are electric by 2030.

At the same time, its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) commit to a 50 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by the end of the decade. Achieving these targets, experts say, could help Pakistan avoid more than 4.5 million tons of CO₂ emissions annually, leading to substantial improvements in public health and environmental quality.

The government estimates potential savings of around US$405 million each year through reduced health expenditures and increased productivity as a result of cleaner air and reduced pollution-related illnesses. The transition to EVs also offers an opportunity to productively utilize Pakistan’s 12 to 16 terawatt-hours of surplus electricity, helping the power sector improve flexibility, efficiency, and financial sustainability.

By channelling unused capacity toward transport electrification, the country can reduce capacity payments to idle power plants — a long-standing strain on the national budget. Equally significant are the anticipated energy and trade benefits. Pakistan’s average annual oil import bill currently stands at US$16.9 billion, a figure that exerts heavy pressure on foreign exchange reserves.

According to the government projections, the implementation of the EV policy could save approximately 2.07 billion litres of oil per year, translating into US$1 billion in import savings by 2030. Such savings would not only strengthen the balance of payments but also reduce the fiscal burden associated with fuel imports and subsidies. In addition to the energy and environmental advantages, the policy is poised to create new opportunities for investment and employment.

By opening the door to EV manufacturing, Pakistan has a “time-limited opportunity” to diversify and deepen its technology base. With minimal incumbency in the electric vehicle segment, the country can establish itself as a competitive regional hub for EV production and associated industries such as battery manufacturing, charging infrastructure, and smart grid technologies. Analysts believe that with international backing and policy certainty, thousands of new jobs could be generated across engineering, assembly, maintenance, and component production sectors.

Olin Corporation (NYSE:OLN) presented its third quarter 2025 results on October 28, revealing a complex performance picture that triggered a significant market reaction. Despite reporting earnings per share of $0.37 that significantly exceeded the forecasted $0.07, the company’s stock plunged 12.53% following the announcement. Revenue came in at $1.71 billion, slightly below analyst expectations of $1.74 billion, as the chemical manufacturer navigated challenging market conditions across its diverse business segments.

The presentation highlighted Olin’s strategic focus on value-first commercial approaches and aggressive inventory management, while emphasizing the positive impact of newly recognized tax credits. However, investors appeared more concerned with ongoing challenges in the company’s Epoxy and Winchester segments, along with cautious fourth-quarter guidance.

Quarterly Performance Highlights

Olin reported third-quarter adjusted EBITDA of $222.4 million, a significant improvement from both the previous quarter ($176 million) and the same period last year ($160 million). This performance was bolstered by a $32 million net benefit from Section 45V Clean Hydrogen Production tax credits, which the company confirmed its eligibility to recognize under the Inflation Reduction Act.

The company’s performance varied considerably across its three main business segments, with Chlor Alkali Products & Vinyls (CAPV) showing strength while Epoxy and Winchester faced headwinds.

As shown in the following segment performance breakdown:

The CAPV segment delivered $924 million in sales and $237 million in adjusted EBITDA for Q3 2025, benefiting from stable electrochemical unit (ECU) values, improved operating costs, and the recognition of tax credits. Management highlighted that their value-first commercial approach helped maintain pricing discipline despite only modest seasonal demand improvement.

Meanwhile, the Epoxy segment continued to operate at a loss, though with some sequential improvements:

The Epoxy business posted sales of $350 million but recorded an adjusted EBITDA loss of $19 million. While Formulated Solutions volumes improved sequentially, the segment faced continued pressure from subsidized Asian imports affecting both U.S. and European markets. European demand was particularly weak, though the company noted it had delivered significant working capital benefits through inventory management.

The Winchester ammunition segment, traditionally a reliable performer, disappointed in Q3:

Winchester generated $440 million in sales but saw adjusted EBITDA decline to $27 million, well below the $62 million reported in the same quarter last year. Management attributed this underperformance to softer commercial sales, higher raw material costs, and a surge in ammunition imports ahead of announced U.S. tariffs.

Detailed Financial Analysis

The sequential improvement in Olin’s adjusted EBITDA from Q2 to Q3 2025 was driven by several factors, as illustrated in this bridge analysis:

The $46 million increase in adjusted EBITDA was primarily attributable to the CAPV segment’s $66 million contribution, which included the IRA tax credits, lower operating costs, and higher EDC volumes. This was partially offset by declines in the Epoxy segment ($8 million), Winchester segment ($6 million), and Corporate ($6 million).

Year-over-year, the company’s performance showed similar patterns:

Compared to Q3 2024, Olin’s adjusted EBITDA improved by $62 million, with the CAPV segment again leading the way with an $85 million increase. This growth was partially offset by a $35 million decline in Winchester, while Epoxy contributed a modest $10 million improvement.

From a balance sheet perspective, Olin maintained its focus on financial discipline:

The company ended the quarter with $140.3 million in cash and $1.3 billion in available liquidity. Management emphasized their commitment to reducing debt levels, targeting year-end 2025 net debt comparable to year-end 2024 levels. The company also expects working capital to be a $100 million source of cash in 2025, excluding tax payment timing.

Strategic Initiatives

Olin’s presentation highlighted several strategic initiatives across its business segments. In CAPV, the company continues to focus on its value-first commercial approach, maintaining stable ECU values despite seasonal demand fluctuations. The dissolution of the Blue Water Alliance joint venture was announced, though details on the strategic implications were limited.

For the Epoxy segment, management is pursuing growth in epichlorohydrin and resin sales following European capacity rationalization, while focusing on qualification for advanced electronics customers in its Formulated Solutions business. The company expects declining U.S. resin feedstock costs and price improvements to enhance margins going forward.

In Winchester, Olin is shifting production toward international military sales while reducing commercial production to address inventory levels. The company noted that price actions are gaining traction in the fourth quarter, and the Next Generation Squad Weapon (NGSW) project remains on schedule.

The following chart illustrates Olin’s pricing strategy effectiveness:

The company’s Profit Contribution Index for ECUs has remained well above the baseline established in Q1 2020, demonstrating the effectiveness of its value-first approach despite market fluctuations.

Forward-Looking Statements

Olin provided a cautious outlook for the fourth quarter, projecting adjusted EBITDA of $110-130 million, which includes an approximately $40 million penalty from planned inventory reductions. This guidance represents a significant sequential decline from the third quarter’s $222.4 million.

The company’s segment-specific outlook for Q4 2025 includes:

For full-year 2025, Olin provided the following modeling assumptions:

Capital spending is forecasted between $200-220 million, slightly above 2024 levels, while depreciation and amortization is expected to remain stable at approximately $525 million. The company anticipates a book tax benefit of $25-35 million but expects to pay $175 million in cash taxes.

CEO Ken Lane expressed optimism about the epoxy market during the earnings call, stating, ""We are more optimistic on epoxy than we have been in the last year and a half,"" while CFO Todd Slater emphasized the company’s focus on cost discipline and cash generation.

Despite these assurances, the market’s negative reaction suggests investors remain concerned about Olin’s ability to navigate ongoing challenges in its key markets, particularly given the projected impact of inventory reduction efforts on near-term results.

Institutions' substantial holdings in Hallador Energy implies that they have significant influence over the company's share price

A total of 12 investors have a majority stake in the company with 51% ownership

To get a sense of who is truly in control of Hallador Energy Company ( ), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 65% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).

And things are looking up for institutional investors after the company gained US$82m in market cap last week. The one-year return on investment is currently 102% and last week's gain would have been more than welcomed.

In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Hallador Energy.

What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Hallador Energy?

Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.

As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Hallador Energy. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Hallador Energy's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.

Institutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Hallador Energy. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is Lubar & Co., Inc. with 12% of shares outstanding. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 5.2% of common stock, and BlackRock, Inc. holds about 4.9% of the company stock. In addition, we found that Brent Bilsland, the CEO has 3.6% of the shares allocated to their name.

After doing some more digging, we found that the top 12 have the combined ownership of 51% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.

While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.

Insider Ownership Of Hallador Energy

The definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.

I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.

We can report that insiders do own shares in Hallador Energy Company. As individuals, the insiders collectively own US$60m worth of the US$889m company. Some would say this shows alignment of interests between shareholders and the board. But it might be worth checking

General Public Ownership

The general public-- including retail investors -- own 14% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.

Private Equity Ownership

With an ownership of 12%, private equity firms are in a position to play a role in shaping corporate strategy with a focus on value creation. Some investors might be encouraged by this, since private equity are sometimes able to encourage strategies that help the market see the value in the company. Alternatively, those holders might be exiting the investment after taking it public.

Next Steps:

It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Hallador Energy better, we need to consider many other factors. For example, we've discovered (1 can't be ignored!) that you should be aware of before investing here.

In the same quarter, 75% of Chinese investment in raw materials went to Africa for the first time, diversifying beyond Asia and Latin America, according to Rhodium.
“Battery capacity going to Africa is chasing the raw materials and a more welcoming environment for Chinese investment,” Pangarkar said.
“Lower costs may be an added benefit.” Since 2019, CATL has built plants in Germany, Hungary, Indonesia, and Spain.
“Chinese companies tend to rely on imported labour from China rather than locally sourced labour in the construction of its plants.","Chinese electric-vehicle companies have invested big bucks over the past decade to establish their global supremacy.

Companies such as CATL and BYD, among others, poured $143 billion into foreign EV and battery ventures between 2014 and 2025, according to data from independent research provider Rhodium Group. With Western trade barriers forcing Chinese companies to rethink their approach to global expansion, in 2024, for the first time, they spent more on building the EV supply chain abroad than at home. “China’s outward investment in the EV ecosystem reflects a deliberate ‘go global’ strategy to secure its full value chain, from raw materials to finished vehicles, as geopolitical frictions and market access barriers rise,” Bill Russo, founder and CEO of Shanghai-based advisory firm Automobility Limited, told Rest of World.

Two countries received the highest EV investment from Chinese firms: Hungary attracted $18 billion, while Indonesia pulled in $22 billion, Rhodium data shows.

Hungary has been strengthening ties with China throughout Viktor Orbán’s 15 years as prime minister, offering tax breaks and infrastructural support. Four of the 10 biggest Chinese investments in Europe last year went to Hungary, and the landlocked nation is on track to become the second-largest battery producer outside of China, according to analysts tracking the investments. Unlike the EU and the U.S., Hungary has no plans to decouple from China.

Indonesia started attracting Chinese investment after banning the export of unprocessed ores in 2014. The country is now the world’s largest supplier of nickel, a crucial battery mineral, providing more than two-thirds of the global supply in 2024. Chinese companies control roughly three-quarters of domestic refining capacity in Indonesia.

Indonesia is also a massive auto market going green. The government has set ambitious targets to deploy 2 million electric cars and 12 million electric two-wheelers by 2030. Chinese players are not just bringing products but also helping build the domestic supply chain.

“The Asian market has been traditionally dominated by the Japanese for [internal combustion engine] vehicles, but because Japan is lagging in EVs, there is an opportunity for the Chinese,” Nitin Pangarkar, associate professor of strategy and policy at the National University of Singapore, told Rest of World. “It is also near China, geographically and culturally.”

Overall, Europe — an early adopter of EVs — had received the bulk of the Chinese investments for component and full vehicle manufacturing. That dynamic shifted with Latin America receiving most of the investment in vehicle assembly in the second quarter of this year. More than two-thirds of the investment in manufacturing components like battery materials went to Asia during the same period.

In the same quarter, 75% of Chinese investment in raw materials went to Africa for the first time, diversifying beyond Asia and Latin America, according to Rhodium.

“Battery capacity going to Africa is chasing the raw materials and a more welcoming environment for Chinese investment,” Pangarkar said. “Lower costs may be an added benefit.”

Since 2019, CATL has built plants in Germany, Hungary, Indonesia, and Spain. By next year, the company aims to start mass production at its 100-GWh battery plant in Hungary, announced in mid-2022. Earlier this year, CATL and its partners set up a $6 billion battery plant in Indonesia to create a full supply chain, from nickel mining to battery manufacturing and recycling.

“CATL’s goal is to make high-quality technology accessible across the globe, helping to achieve international sustainability goals,” the company told Rest of World in an emailed statement. “As part of our global strategy to better respond to the needs of our customers and meet the growing demand for electric vehicles worldwide, CATL has actively expanded the overseas footprint through a series of investments in four manufacturing plants outside China.”

BYD’s passenger vehicle factory in Hungary is currently under construction — the first of its kind by a Chinese automaker in Europe. In West Java, Indonesia, the company is building a $1 billion factory expected to be operational in January 2026.

BYD did not respond to Rest of World‘s request for comment.

Chinese companies began acquiring stakes in critical minerals in the mid-2010s, targeting cobalt in Congo, lithium in Latin America, and nickel in Indonesia, Armand Meyer, senior research analyst at Rhodium, told Rest of World. This global push for extracting raw materials peaked between 2021 and 2023, driven by demand for lithium and local refining requirements. It has since tapered off.

“Investment in mining and refining has slowed due to tighter restrictions on foreign ownership of critical minerals and volatile lithium prices,” Meyer said.

In the midst of U.S.-China tensions, Chinese players are investing in Morocco and Nigeria for critical minerals, expanding their Southeast Asia battery push, and setting up regional production hubs in Mexico and Brazil.

Chinese players have struggled to replicate their domestic success abroad. Only 25% of announced projects in other countries have been completed, compared with a 45% completion rate at home, Rhodium data shows. Cancellation rates abroad are at 14% versus 7% for domestic projects. These firms face several challenges outside their home turf, from underdeveloped local sectors to talent constraints to regulatory and policy hurdles.

Planning approvals are easier to obtain in China compared to many other countries, Louis Brennan, a business professor at Trinity College Dublin, told Rest of World. Talent and technical prowess, China’s biggest assets at home, become double-edged swords abroad, he said.

“Chinese companies tend to rely on imported labour from China rather than locally sourced labour in the construction of its plants. … Such labour policies generate local resentments and opposition,” Brennan said. “Added to that is the anxiety that China feels about the leakage of its advanced technology.”

Even with these growing pains, Chinese EV firms see merit in placing bets around the globe, Russo said.

“Still, even if only a fraction of projects are completed, the direction of travel is clear: China is methodically rewiring the global EV supply chain around its industrial and geopolitical interests,” he said.",https://restofworld.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/China_FDI_V2.jpg,N,,2025-10-29 06:18:17.223914

A new job posting from the company seeks a Manufacturing Engineer to help design and launch battery manufacturing equipment specifically for the upcoming electric supercar.

The listing calls for someone to “contribute to the concept development & launch of battery manufacturing equipment for its cutting-edge next-generation Roadster vehicle.”

Tesla adds that “in this role you will take large scale manufacturing systems for new battery products and architectures from the early concept development stage through equipment launch, optimization and handover to local operations teams. Battery development is at the heart of our company, and this is an exciting opportunity to work directly on the central challenges for the all-new Roadster product architecture while still in its early development stages.”

This marks one of the first concrete signs that Roadster production could be inching closer, even if it’s still some time away. The listing indicates that Tesla is now actively building out the manufacturing infrastructure that will support the car’s unique battery systems — a crucial step before volume production can begin.

The timing also aligns with recent comments from Tesla Chief Designer Franz von Holzhausen, who confirmed last week that the next-generation Roadster is still on track to be unveiled before the end of the year. If that schedule holds, we could soon see Tesla finally deliver on its long-promised halo car, first announced back in 2017.

Tesla and CEO Elon Musk have set sky-high expectations for the all-new Roadster, previously claiming it would achieve a jaw-dropping 0–60 mph time of under one second thanks to advanced battery technology and potential cold-gas thrusters. It remains to be seen, however, how many of these ambitious promises will make it to production.

It is becoming (or has already become) an obvious need. Yet, renewable projects face funding issues. The most promising projects require significant capital for building:

Solar farms

Wind parks

Battery storage systems

And not all developers have the tax capacity to fully benefit from government incentives.

That is where tax credit marketplace are helping a lot. They are unlocking new ways to finance sustainability and making it faster, easier, and more accessible for both clean energy developers and corporations looking to meet their green goals.

What is a Tax Credit Marketplace?

In simple terms, a tax credit marketplace is a digital or structured platform that connects clean energy developers (who earn tax credits) with corporations (that can use them to offset tax liabilities).

See, how it works:

Step Party Involved What Happens 1 Clean energy developer Builds renewable projects and earns federal tax credits 2 Corporation Purchases unused credits to reduce its federal tax bill 3 Marketplace Acts as a secure bridge between both parties

This process replaces the traditional ""tax equity financing"" model, which used to be time-consuming and complex. With marketplaces, transactions are faster, simpler, and open to a broader set of investors.

Why Tax Credit Marketplaces Are Gaining Momentum

Let us have a look at the primary reasons:

1. Increased Market Size and Liquidity

The numbers tell a compelling story. In 2023, around $9 billion worth of tax credit transactions took place out of an estimated $40 billion market. By 2024, this figure nearly tripled to $20-25 billion, and experts project $55-60 billion in 2025.

This rapid growth brings more liquidity to the sector. Developers who previously could not use all their tax credits can now sell them easily and reinvest in new renewable projects. It is a win-win for the clean energy economy.

2. Simplified Financing Mechanisms

Earlier, developers relied on tax equity deals, which is a process involving several legal and financial layers that could take up to a year. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) introduced a major breakthrough by allowing developers to sell their tax credits directly for cash.

Feature Traditional Tax Equity Tax Credit Marketplace Structure Complex partnerships Direct transaction Timeline 6-12 months ~3 months Investor Base Limited Wide corporate access

This new model has transformed green financing. Deals that once took months to structure now close within a quarter.

3. Broader Participation

One of the most exciting outcomes of this shift is inclusivity. Previously, only large institutional investors could participate in tax equity financing. Now, through the tax credit marketplace, a wide range of corporations can invest in clean energy simply by purchasing tax credits.

Such a marketplace connects tax advisors, sustainability consultants, and corporations with hundreds of clean energy developers across the U.S. That is democratization in action.

Benefits for Stakeholders

The main advantages are as follows:

Developers: Easier Monetization of Credits

Many renewable developers do not generate enough taxable income to fully use the credits they earn. Selling them through a marketplace ensures they don't go to waste. Instead, they convert into immediate funding. It allows developers to scale operations and start new projects faster.

Corporations: Financial and Sustainability Advantages

For corporations, purchasing tax credits can offset up to 75% of their federal tax obligations. It is a way to invest in responsible behavior apart from savings. Businesses can set their tax approaches with environmental and governance goals. It is strengthening both brand reputation and impact.

Supporting Clean Energy Growth

The influence of tax credit marketplaces extends far beyond transactions. Tax credits fund 30-60% of total project financing for clean energy. Developers sell these credits and gain steady capital to build:

Solar farms

Wind turbines

Energy storage

Clean fuel projects

This model becomes more powerful because it accelerates both business and environmental goals. Developers get their funding, and corporations get tax savings and green credibility.

Innovation, Flexibility, and Future Trends

The tax credit transfer market is evolving quickly. Sellers are now offering flexible pricing to attract investment-grade buyers, sometimes even for credits generated in future years.

And the marketplace is not limited to solar or wind anymore. It's expanding into:

Energy storage projects

Advanced manufacturing

Clean fuels and hydrogen

Geothermal energy

The tax credit marketplace model shows great adaptability that can transform with changing technology and energy needs.

Policy and Regulatory Support

The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) was actually a turning point for sustainable finance. It gave project sponsors the flexibility to raise funds in a proper way through tax credit trading.

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has also provided detailed guidance, helping businesses understand how to transfer credits securely and transparently. These clear rules have reduced uncertainty, encouraging more players to enter the market.

With ongoing regulatory support, the tax credit ecosystem is becoming stronger, more transparent, and more trusted.

The Bigger Picture: Financial and Environmental Alignment

At its core, the tax credit marketplace bridges financial motivation with climate responsibility. Corporations no longer have to choose between profit and planet; they can pursue both.

Businesses contribute directly to emission reduction goals by monetizing tax credits and reinvesting in renewable energy. All of this happens simultaneously, along with improving their financial performance.

This dual benefit is why tax credit trading is often described as the future of green finance.

Conclusion

The rise of the tax credit marketplace has redefined how clean energy is funded. It is a

Financial innovation

Green accelerator

Marketplaces are turning climate commitments into tangible results. Billions are flowing into renewable projects, streamlined transaction models, and inclusive participation.

As more businesses and developers join this ecosystem, the world moves closer to a cleaner, greener, and financially smarter future.

On the 24th, Aclara stated that the plant will process raw material from its ion-adsorption rare earth ore in Brazil and Chile, and is expected to be completed in 2027, depending on financing and permitting outcomes.

The project is expected to cover 33 hectares at the Port of Vinton near Lake Charles, with access to the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway and nearby transport to chlor-alkali facilities required by Aclara's smelter. The site's infrastructure, chemical industrial base, and logistics channels were key factors in the selection, the company said in a press release.

""Our project is unique in the Western world,"" said Ramon Barua, CEO of Aclara. ""By directly developing our ion-adsorption deposits, this will be the only integrated heavy rare earth separation facility capable of large-scale production today.""

Virginia Tech (VT)

Aclara is 57% owned by Hochschild Mining. The company said it plans to supply three-quarters of US dysprosium and terbium demand by 2028. This equates to annual supply of 200 mt of dysprosium, 30 mt of terbium, and 1,400 mt of well-separated oxides such as Pr-Nd.

The Louisiana-based smelter will serve as a supply chain hub for rare earths used in EVs, wind turbines, drones, and national defense systems in the West.

The company intends to use technology co-developed with VT, whose pilot plant is scheduled to begin operations in early 2026.

Ucore Smelter

Aclara intends to partner with Ucore Rare Metals, which is building its own processing plant in Alexandria, Louisiana. Ucore also operates a rare earth demonstration plant in Kingston, Ontario.

This month, Aclara announced indicated ore resources at the Carina project of 236.3 million mt, with grades of 0.0293% Pr-Nd oxide, 0.0043% dysprosium, and 0.00068% terbium, totaling 371,492 mt of TREO. Inferred resources were 48 million mt, grading 0.0236% Pr-Nd, 0.0041% dysprosium, and 0.00064% terbium, for a TREO of 61,675 mt.

Based on a preliminary economic assessment completed in January 2024, the project is expected to produce 191 mt of dysprosium and terbium annually. The study estimates that, with an 8% discount rate, the mine has a 22-year operating life, a net present value of $1.5 billion, and an internal rate of return of 27%. In September, under a bilateral critical minerals cooperation framework agreement, Aclara received $500 in funding from the U.S. government to develop the Carina rare earth mine.

Penco Project

Aclara is advancing the smaller-scale Penco project in Chile on the same timeline. The project has measured and indicated ore resources of 27.5 million mt at a TREO grade of 0.2292%, representing a total rare earth oxide content of 62,900 mt. Last year, the environmental impact assessment report for the Penco project was approved after enhancements to social and water management standards.

The refinery in Louisiana is designed with flexibility to process ion-adsorption type rare earth ore from other sources or compatible raw materials. As the resource base in South America expands, Aclara plans to increase production. Earlier this year, the company began construction of a pilot plant in Brazil, aiming to validate smelting recovery rates and optimize its proprietary separation process.

The move to Louisiana is part of a wave of investment in rare earth separation, processing, and magnet production in North America, including Apple Inc. and the U.S. federal government’s stake in MP Materials (MPM). The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) has funded several magnet production and processing projects under Title III of the Defense Production Act.

Aclara was spun off from Hochschild Mining in 2021, focusing on the mining of ion-adsorption type rare earth ore using a patented process based on water rather than traditional acid leaching. The company states that this method reduces waste and avoids generating radioactive by-products, addressing major environmental challenges in the rare earth industry.",https://static.metal.com/common.metal.com/images/header-en/smm-logo.png,N,,2025-10-29 13:15:30.956891

Calls also increased from four to six calls for electric scooters and from six to 10 calls for golf carts.
Sales tax hike The Village Board also voted to increase the sales tax Monday, effective July 1, 2026.
The increase equates to a 50 cent tax increase on every $100 purchase.
Tomasoski said the sales tax increase reflects the village’s growth and signals a positive trend.","The Mokena Village Board passed ordinances Monday to regulate electric vehicles and scooters to increase pedestrian safety and increase the sales tax by a half cent to 8% Monday night.

The village approved four new rules governing electric vehicles proposed by police Chief Brian Benton, who warned the safety restrictions were needed before the holidays, when he said there is an uptick in electric scooter and bike purchases. He also said the winter months are a good time to educate the public before the warmer spring months, when the village sees an increase in electric vehicle use.

These ordinances will take effect in the next 30 days, Benton said.

The ordinance only allows residents ages 16 and under to ride class one and two electric bikes without parent supervision. A class one bike only provides motor assistance when pedaling and does not exceed 20 mph, and a class two bike includes a throttle assist where the motor can be used to propel the bike without using the pedals.

Individuals 16 and older can use class three bikes under the ordinance and state law. A class three bike is the same as a class one bike, so a motor only provides assistance when pedaling, but the bike can reach up to 28 mph.

Driver’s licenses area not required for any class of these bikes under the ordinance, and Benton said electric bike riders must follow all bicycle rules such as having headlights and safety reflectors.

The ordinance also brings local rule into compliance with state law, which requires electric scooter riders to have a driver’s license and be 18 or older. These scooters can be driven on streets up to 30 mph.

Tinley Park has similar rules governing e-scooters, but other suburbs like Orland Park, New Lenox and Frankfurt do not allow them.

Benton said an exemption in the ordinance allows children to use small scooters intended to be toys.

The ordinance will also allow golf carts on residential streets with speed limits of 25 mph or lower. The driver is required to have a valid license with insurance. These carts will not be allowed to go in business districts except to cross streets and will be required to have safety components such as lights, signals, mirror, seatbelts and an safety reflector emblem.

Golf carts are permitted in nearby suburbs such as New Lenox and Tinley Park but not permitted in Frankfort and Orland Park.

The last part of ordinance allows low-speed vehicles on all streets under Illinois state law as long as the driver has a valid license and insurance, and the vehicle meets state and federal safety standards.

Benton said calls for police to respond to electric vehicles have increased in recent years. For example, he said police received 16 calls about electric bikes in 2025, compared to three calls in 2023. Calls also increased from four to six calls for electric scooters and from six to 10 calls for golf carts.

Benton reminded the public electric bikes and scooters are not allowed on sidewalks under state law, a timely sentiment given upcoming Halloween celebrations, said Trustees Terry Germany and Debbie Engler and Mayor George Metanias.

Engler asked residents to be aware of these vehicles when trick-or-treating over the weekend.

“I’m sure there will kids on e-bikes, scooters, walking running, whatever else they can do out there,” Engler said.

Germany agreed and said the ordinance “couldn’t happen fast enough.”

“If we can save one little accident, yeah, watchout for the kids on Halloween,” Germany said.

Sales tax hike

The Village Board also voted to increase the sales tax Monday, effective July 1, 2026. The increase equates to a 50 cent tax increase on every $100 purchase. Every dollar collected would go to repair roads, upgrade water and sewer systems and maintain essential village facilities, according to John Tomasoski, village administrator.

Tomasoski said the sales tax increase reflects the village’s growth and signals a positive trend. He said the village needs to build more stable sources of funding and reduce its dependence on revenue tied to new development, without overburdening residents’ property and utility taxes.

He called the water and sewer capital funds “financial orphans,” referencing that they have not had a dedicated block of funding and are instead funded by the general fund surplus and one-time fees imposed by utility companies for connecting a property to their water and sewer systems.

Those funds are decreasing as the village’s growth is decreasing due to it being almost fully built out. As a sign of this, he said his discussions are increasingly shifting from how the village should grow to how it can enhance residents’ quality of life.

“As Mokena is entering that new chapter as a mature built up community, revenue from our growth has naturally declined,” Tomasoski said.

But as that growth decreases, the village faces larger capital projects to adjust to its size, such as a wastewater treatment plant improvement that totaled just over $11.2 million and was mainly funded by those one time fees saved up over time and the general fund.

General fund surplus also funded a police station capital project totaling to $18.2 million, and he said officials would also like to fund village hall improvements, that would include moving it to another property, as the current hall is in an old school building.

“The general fund can no longer be the big brother to the other funds,” Tomasoski said.

Tomasoski also announced a 2025 tax levy Monday night that will be presented to the board for adoption on Nov. 24, 2025.

He said officials expect the 2025 aggregate tax levy to be $2,301,425, which reflects an increase of about $64,210 since the previous year, driven by the consumer price index and real growth.",https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo-1200x1200.png,N,,2025-10-29 12:08:04.624516

Next, EPA issued a proposed rule to repeal the majority of the MATS Rule, including the three requirements set forth above.
Good Neighbor Plan.
The Trump administration has announced its intention to reconsider the Good Neighbor Plan and underlying good neighbor state implementation plan disapprovals that provide the EPA with authority to implement a federal plan.
The EPA plans to pursue a two-phased approach to revisit the Good Neighbor Plan and the underlying SIP disapprovals.","The Environmental Protection Agency has had a busy 2025, and it started off with a bang. It announced 31 major regulatory initiatives—many involving reconsideration of rules promulgated by the Biden administration. President Donald Trump, alongside EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, has hosted events and signed executive orders aimed at reviving the use of coal for reliable energy across the country.

And the agency’s long-awaited Unified Agenda set forth an ambitious deregulatory scheme. Yet uncertainty remains.

Most of the EPA’s deregulatory actions of the past year were proposed rules. Proposed rules can, and often do, change on their way to becoming final rules. With 2025 winding down, and the government shutdown continuing unabated, 2026 could be the year these regulatory changes are made final or take effect.

Power sector Clean Air Act regulations are at the heart of the deregulatory agenda, with no less than 25 items in EPA’s Unified Agenda affecting power sector air regulations.

Amid all this change, it can be difficult to know where to focus one’s attention. Here are four major regulatory changes to look out for in the new year:

Greenhouse Gas Standards. The EPA has proposed two pathways for future regulation of greenhouse gas emissions from the power sector. Both paths would undo all or part of the Biden administration’s 2024 final GHG standards.

One pathway would eliminate all GHG emission standards for the entire sector, and the EPA would cease to regulate GHGs altogether. This is a major departure from the past administrations’ approach to GHG regulation and involves a fundamental shift in how Section 111 of the Clean Air Act is interpreted. If finalized, this pathway would make continuing to run coal-fired electric generating units more practical and eliminate barriers to permitting other new generation, especially large baseload units.

In the second proposal, regulation of GHG emissions from the power sector remains but certain, and more onerous or infeasible requirements are rolled back, such as coal unit sunsetting and carbon capture and storage requirements. This pathway would help coal-fired units survive and would assure that new baseload combustion turbines could operate at full capacity without CCS.

Either scenario could change the trajectory of how long the power sectors plans to keep running its existing coal fleet, and how it plans for new generation. The Unified Agenda estimates a final rule will be released in December 2025.

MATS Revisions. The Biden administration’s 2024 revisions to the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards are likely on their way out. The revisions slashed mercury emission limits from lignite-fired EGUs by more than one-half and lowered filterable particulate matter from all coal-fired units, as well as required all units subject to MATS install continuous monitoring systems.

The Trump administration dealt its first blow to this rule by issuing “Presidential Exemptions” that extended the compliance deadline for MATS from to July 2029. Next, EPA issued a proposed rule to repeal the majority of the MATS Rule, including the three requirements set forth above.

This proposed rule is likely to be finalized without substantial change. The Unified Agenda sets an estimated date for a final rule of December 2025. If finalized, this rule will ensure achievable emissions limitations. Coal plants won’t need to commence expensive emission control upgrade projects that could have been a driver for future retirements.

Good Neighbor Plan. The Biden administration took major strides to finalize a federal plan to regulate interstate transport of ozone emissions in its “Good Neighbor Plan.” The plan initially required 23 states to comply with stringent seasonal NOx emissions requirements through the EPA’s federal trading program to curb ozone emissions to resolve good neighbor obligations for the 2015 ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards.

Since its debut in 2023, judicial stays and decisions caused myriad states to drop out of the plan, and finally the agency stayed the rule in response to the Supreme Court’s judicial stay in June 2024. The Trump administration has announced its intention to reconsider the Good Neighbor Plan and underlying good neighbor state implementation plan disapprovals that provide the EPA with authority to implement a federal plan.

The EPA plans to pursue a two-phased approach to revisit the Good Neighbor Plan and the underlying SIP disapprovals. While proposed rules were originally expected in August and October, the EPA has yet to release its proposals. The agency may reverse SIP disapprovals, which would obviate the need for a federal plan for those states. It’s unclear what approach the EPA will take in formulating a new federal plan for states that don’t have satisfactory ozone transport SIPs or failed to submit a SIP altogether. The new Good Neighbor approach may provide relief to power plants that would have been constrained by lower NOx allowances during the summer, which may have been a driver for retirement for certain coal-fired plants.

Particulate Matter Air Quality Standard. In 2024, the Biden administration lowered the primary PM2.5 NAAQS from 12 to 9 µg/m3 by reversing a 2020 rule to retain the 2012 PM NAAQS (2024 PM NAAQS Reconsideration). The Trump EPA is revisiting the 2024 PM NAAQS Reconsideration. EPA planned to issue a proposed rule by July 2025, which hasn’t yet occurred. The Unified Agenda had projected a final rule in January 2026, although court filings state it will be finalized by February 2026.

EPA is most likely to issue a proposed rule determining that the agency shouldn’t have “reconsidered” the PM NAAQS and reinstate the 12 µg/m3 standard. Raising the PM NAAQS would ease permitting for projects that require modeling, including projects to build new generation, as more areas of the country would remain in attainment with the higher standard.

Regulatory change is coming and could result in an easing of standards and regulations that significantly affect power plants, both in terms of everyday compliance and longer-term resource planning.

However, any final rule is likely to be challenged by opponents in court. It will be important to monitor judicial activity to determine the regulatory durability of the Trump administration’s rollbacks.

To support this transition, the federal government introduced the Alternative Fuel Refueling Property Tax Credit, commonly known as the EV charger tax credit. This program makes it easier and more affordable for homeowners and businesses to install EV chargers while promoting a cleaner, more sustainable future.

Learn all about how the federal EV charger installation tax credit works, what it covers, and how Houston residents can take full advantage of available incentives.

What Is the Federal EV Charger Tax Credit?

The EV charging tax credit—officially called the Alternative Fuel Refueling Property Tax Credit—allows homeowners and businesses to deduct 30% of the total cost of purchasing and installing an EV charger.

Homeowners can claim up to $1,000 in tax credit.

Businesses can claim up to $100,000 per installation.

⚠️ Important Update (2025):

Under the most recent federal rule changes, this incentive will expire on June 30, 2026.

Previously, the credit was available through 2032, but the timeline has now been shortened. That means homeowners and business owners in Texas have just over a year to take advantage of this valuable incentive before it ends.

This federal program remains one of the most effective ways to reduce upfront EV charger installation costs and make the switch to electric more affordable.

Learn more about how this incentive works in detail on Federal EV Charger Tax Credit Explained.

Who Qualifies for the EV Charger Tax Credit?

To be eligible for the federal tax credit, your charger must meet a few key requirements:

Installed on your property: The charger must be installed at a location you own or lease, such as your home or business.

Certified and compliant: Equipment must meet all safety standards under the National Electric Code (NEC) and be certified by Underwriters Laboratories (UL) or an equivalent testing organization.

Used primarily for EVs: The charger should be used mainly for charging electric or plug-in hybrid vehicles.

Meeting these requirements ensures homeowners and business owners in Texas can confidently claim the federal incentive while ensuring a safe and compliant installation.

Why It’s Great for Texas Homeowners and Businesses

For many Texans, the initial cost of installing an EV charger is the main barrier. The federal EV charger installation tax credit helps offset those costs by reducing the overall expense of equipment, labor, and permitting.

For homeowners: It makes EV ownership more convenient and practical.

For businesses: Installing EV chargers can attract more customers, support employees who drive EVs, and even qualify for additional tax deductions.

Whether you want to charge your EV faster at home or increase the value of your commercial property, this incentive makes the investment financially smart and future-focused.

How to Claim the EV Charging Tax Credit

Claiming the credit is straightforward but requires keeping proper documentation. Here’s how to do it:

Save all receipts for equipment purchases and installation.

Complete IRS Form 8911 (Alternative Fuel Vehicle Refueling Property Credit) when filing your federal tax return.

Apply in the same year your charger was installed and activated.

Include labor costs, as they qualify for the credit.

Remember: this is a non-refundable tax credit, meaning it reduces the amount of tax you owe but won’t result in a refund if the credit exceeds your tax liability.

Additional Incentives in Houston and Texas

While Texas doesn’t currently have a statewide EV charger rebate, several local programs can further reduce installation costs:

Entergy Texas eTech Program: Offers a $250 rebate for installing a Level 2 home EV charger.

Gexa Energy: Provides bill credits for charging during off-peak hours (11 p.m. – 5 a.m.).

Local utility rebates: Some municipal utilities offer time-of-use rates or small rebates for EV charger installations.

As a Houston-based solar and EV charging company, Solstice Solar helps homeowners navigate these programs to ensure they receive all eligible rebates and tax credits. The team’s certified installers assist with setup, documentation, and filing for federal credits.

Act Now Before the Credit Expires

If you’re considering installing an EV charger, now is the time to act. With the federal EV charger tax credit ending on June 30, 2026, homeowners and businesses across Texas have a limited window to save.

Solstice Solar can help you secure your installation, ensure all eligibility requirements are met, and handle the paperwork—so you can maximize savings before the deadline.

Between those two decisions, however, Hyundai bucked the trend, announcing plans in March for its Louisiana steel plant.
But by 2034, Groch said, Hyundai intends to start producing green hydrogen — made with renewable energy — at the facility to power the process.
A new survey, shared with Canary Media, shows 60% of residents in the area favor investment in green hydrogen for steelmaking.
“They could eventually be selling green hydrogen as far as Indiana,” Groch said of Hyundai.","Hyundai Motor Group says its plan to invest $6 billion in a low-carbon steel plant in Louisiana ​“remains unchanged,” despite the Trump administration’s cuts to tax credits for the green hydrogen needed to produce clean iron and a recent immigration raid on a factory the automaker is building in Georgia.

In a statement last week to NPR’s Gulf States Newsroom, Hyundai said the company’s investment ​“is centered on creating thousands of high-quality American jobs.” The South Korean car manufacturer did not respond to Canary Media’s request for comment.

The Louisiana facility, set to come online in 2029, has emerged as the United States’ leading green-steel initiative.

“This is going to be the flagship project when it comes to green steel,” said Matthew Groch, senior director of decarbonization at the environmental group Mighty Earth.

Days before President Donald Trump returned to office in January, Swedish steel company SSAB quietly pulled out of talks with the Department of Energy for a $500 million grant to support a green-steel project in Mississippi. In June, Cleveland-Cliffs backed away from its plans to replace the blast furnaces at its Middletown Works facility in Ohio with cleaner, hydrogen-ready technology, also with $500 million in financing from the federal government.

Between those two decisions, however, Hyundai bucked the trend, announcing plans in March for its Louisiana steel plant.

Designed to use direct reduced iron, a cleaner method of making iron that relies on natural gas or hydrogen instead of the coal that fuels a blast furnace, the Hyundai facility is slated to produce 2.7 million metric tons of steel each year, including​“low-carbon steel sheets using the abundant supply of steel scrap in the U.S.”

Hyundai’s initial press release did not explicitly mention direct reduced iron or hydrogen. But a Korean newspaper article noted at the time that the project would include direct reduced iron, and the 3.6 million tons of iron ore the Louisiana government said the plant would import each year will require some kind of processing. Since then, the company has clarified its plans at state regulatory hearings, Groch said.

At a Louisiana Clean Hydrogen Task Force meeting in June, Hyundai laid out its vision for bringing the plant online in about four years using what’s called blue hydrogen, a version of the fuel made with natural gas and equipped with carbon-capture technology to prevent the emissions from entering the atmosphere. But by 2034, Groch said, Hyundai intends to start producing green hydrogen — made with renewable energy — at the facility to power the process.

A clean industrial plant would likely be welcomed in Ascension Parish, roughly an hour west of New Orleans in the heart of the Bayou State’s so-called Cancer Alley. A new survey, shared with Canary Media, shows 60% of residents in the area favor investment in green hydrogen for steelmaking. The poll, commissioned by the Sierra Club’s Delta Chapter and conducted by JMC Analytics, ​“makes clear that steel manufacturing at this scale presents a unique set of opportunities for Louisianans,” said Angelle Bradford Rosenberg, the chair of the Sierra Club affiliate’s board.

“Residents are aware that the technology exists to make steel that is clean and has low impact on communities — they want Hyundai to make good on their promises,” Bradford Rosenberg said in a statement. ​“This poll shows that communities want industry to prioritize clean energy, and provide steel using renewable energy.”

For much of the past decade, Hyundai has focused on growing its presence in the U.S. market, particularly as competition from cheap Chinese electric vehicles mounts in Asia and Europe. The steel plant is part of a broader $26 billion investment that includes the EV-battery plant in Georgia where Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrested and shackled hundreds of South Korean workers in a high-profile raid in September.

Signs are emerging of Hyundai’s broader ambitions. First, there’s the location of the plant in Ascension Parish. That industrial corridor hosts the Louisiana stretch of an ammonia pipeline system that extends from the Gulf state all the way north to Indiana. Hydrogen is notoriously tricky to ship because the world’s smallest molecule is prone to dangerous leaking. Transformed into ammonia, however, hydrogen becomes a liquid that can be easily transported via a pipeline.

“They could eventually be selling green hydrogen as far as Indiana,” Groch said of Hyundai. ​“That’s why they’re building it there.”

Then, there’s the potential to supply rivals.

Last September, General Motors inked a partnership with Hyundai to work together on new car models and establish a shared supply chain that circumvents China. In June, news broke that GM abandoned the Chinese steel company supplying its Korean factories in favor of a new deal with Hyundai.

In August, however, GM signed an unusual three-year deal to buy steel for its American plants from Cleveland-Cliffs. Typically, such deals are structured to last a year. But the expiration date of this one coincides with when Hyundai expects to start selling steel made in Louisiana in the U.S.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/GettyImages-2206219842.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=e3b25296f1c178a70bd4a04b0818b4e7,N,,2025-10-29 04:02:49.217562

“They’re trying to collaborate, trying to coordinate,” said Francis Pullaro, president of clean-energy trade association Renew Northeast. ​“This is a preview of what’s to come.”

The next eight months are crucial for commercial-scale clean-energy developments nationwide. The tax credits included in former President Joe Biden’s 2022 Inflation Reduction Act spurred massive investment in the sector, with more than $360 billion in projects already announced as of June 2024. Now the Trump administration is phasing out the incentives for wind and solar farms, requiring them to begin construction by July 4, 2026, or be placed in service by the end of 2027 in order to qualify for the tax credits. Across the country, states are responding by streamlining permitting processes and fast-tracking clean-energy procurements to get projects going in time.

Maine and Connecticut — which both aim to get all of their power from clean sources by 2040 — have been among the states looking for ways to get projects in under the deadline. In July, Maine asked for proposals for up to 1,600 gigawatt-hours of renewable energy, giving developers just two weeks to submit their bids; regulators selected one hydropower and four solar developments in September.

It was Connecticut’s call for collaborators that sparked the emerging partnership between the states.

Connecticut released a request for proposals for solar and onshore wind projects in September, with a deadline of Oct. 10. The initial timeline calls for bids to be selected in November, and final contracts to be submitted by the end of the year. The call for proposals included provisions to allow other states to participate. Each state would make its own evaluations; if another state decided to select a project, it would coordinate with Connecticut on finalizing the terms of the deal.

Maine’s newly created Department of Energy Resources saw potential in this opportunity and reached out to the state’s utility commission, which voted to join Connecticut’s procurement. This move does not mean Maine will necessarily choose the same projects as its New England neighbor, just that it will have the opportunity to assess the same bids against its own criteria and needs.

The hope is that, by pooling demand and sharing information, both states will emerge with more efficient and viable projects at lower prices for residents.

“It makes a lot of sense for a state like Maine to piggyback on their efforts and hopefully enter into contracts for a share of the capacity that gets bid in cost-effectively,” said Jamie Dickerson, senior director of climate and clean-energy programs at Acadia Center, an advocacy group.

Both Connecticut and Maine have previously attempted to collaborate with other states on renewable-energy procurements, though not on quite as tight a timeline.

In 2022, Massachusetts agreed to buy 40% of the power produced by a planned onshore wind farm in northern Maine, though that development stalled when a deal for an associated transmission line fell through. In 2023, Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island announced a three-state offshore wind solicitation; in the end, Connecticut declined to choose any of the bidders, although the two other participating states contracted nearly 2.9 GW of capacity.

Whether this latest endeavor yields any joint procurements remains to be seen, but Pullaro is confident that it will not be the last cooperative effort among New England states as the tax-credit deadline looms.

“The states are having a lot of conversations,” he said.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/Solar-in-Gray-Maine.jpeg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=ec4205d69f5a66a04e9ee432853df9cd,N,,2025-10-29 04:02:44.327296

Summary

AI-driven infrastructure is fueling a surge in U.S. electricity demand, with data centers projected to double their global energy consumption by 2030.

Rising energy needs may drive up electricity bills and oil prices, potentially reigniting inflation and complicating the Federal Reserve's rate cut plans.

A historical correlation between gold prices and 10-year Treasury yields suggests a possible interest rate hike scenario in 2026, contrary to current market expectations.

If oil prices rise sharply due to AI-related energy demand, a second inflation wave could emerge, posing risks to both stock and bond markets.

We are all excited about the current AI developments and how they will change our lives. Businesses are investing billions in it, the stock market is soaring, and the Federal Reserve seems willing to cut interest rates and

Hi there, welcome to my profile. My name is Eugenio Catone, I live in Italy and I am 27 years old.In 2023 I graduated in Business Administration and I completed CFA level 1 in 2024. I am currently a Popular Investor on the investing platform eToro, you can see there my public portfolio. My interest in financial markets started about 5 years ago when I accidentally came across a video about trading. That was the spark that introduced me to a new world, but over time I realized that it was not my path: too many charts, lines, and not very concrete concepts for a pragmatic person like me. I needed something different and that I found in fundamental analysis. It is a totally different approach and one that evaluates the actual results achieved by a company rather than the candlesticks made by its price per share. That was the turning point for me and I have not stopped learning ever since. I mainly invest in stocks and ETFs; I prefer US companies but I often analyze European or Chinese companies as well.

This summer, Kelley rolled out the Kelley AI Playbook, a working guide that shows faculty how to weave generative AI into teaching, grading, research, and service — and how to do it responsibly. The school revised the playbook in October.

Dean Patrick Hopkins, who has made “future-proofing faculty” a central priority of his tenure, says the Playbook is about clarity and transparency in a rapidly changing environment.

“This is instruction-heavy because that’s the front line,” Hopkins tells Poets&Quants. “But really it’s about transparency — how do you go about ethically utilizing AI in the educational mission? We wanted to make it public so that other universities could use it too.”

ETHICS AND TRANSPARENCY — NOT HYPE

The Playbook is framed around Kelley’s shared values, making the case that faculty must not only teach with AI but also model ethical and discerning use of it. It calls for openness about when AI is used in course design or grading, insists that adoption should serve clear instructional purposes rather than trendy tool-chasing, and emphasizes that technology can support but never substitute for faculty expertise.

Faculty are encouraged to experiment, to share successes and failures candidly, and to demonstrate discernment by showing students when to use AI and when to leave it aside.

Underlying the Playbook is a simple premise: Kelley students will graduate into workplaces where AI is assumed. “Whether or not we use AI personally, we must recognize that our students will be expected to use it in the workplace,” the guide states. Faculty, then, have a responsibility to help them use it wisely, ethically, and effectively.

TRAINING PROFESSORS TO PREPARE STUDENTS

Hopkins frames the Playbook as another step in future-proofing students by first future-proofing faculty. “AI is really table stakes now,” he says. “But business is still a social endeavor.

Abstract: EPA is seeking renewal of a generic information collection request (ICR) for the conduct of focus groups and protocol interviews (hereafter jointly referred to as focus groups) related to economics projects. Over the next three years, the Agency anticipates engaging in survey development efforts associated with a variety of economics projects including those related to drinking water quality, health risk reductions, coastal adaptation and restoration, to name a few. Focus groups are an important part of any survey development process, allowing researchers to directly gauge what specific issues are important to the public and providing a means for explicitly testing draft survey materials. Through these focus groups, the Agency will be able to gain a more in-depth understanding of the public's attitudes, beliefs, motivations and feelings regarding specific issues and will provide valuable information regarding the quality of draft survey instruments. The information collected in the focus groups will be used primarily to develop and improve economics-related surveys. To the extent that these surveys are ultimately approved and successfully administered, they will serve to expand the Agency's understanding of benefits and costs of a variety of actions and could provide the means to quantitatively assess the effects of others. Participation in the focus groups will be voluntary, and the identity of the participants will be kept confidential. Form Numbers: None. Respondents/affected entities: Individuals. Respondent's obligation to respond: Voluntary. Estimated number of respondents: 432 (total). Frequency of response: Once. Total estimated burden: 288 hours (per year). Burden is defined at 5 CFR 1320.03(b). Total estimated cost: $100,973 (per year), which includes $80,000 annualized capital or operation & maintenance costs. Changes in the Estimates: There is decrease of 1,314 hours in the 3-year total estimated respondent burden compared with the ICR currently approved by OMB. A decrease in burden over the previous ICR conveys simply that EPA anticipates less need for the conduct of focus groups under this ICR than in the past.

The company aims to reach a 70% US supply chain and has key partners such as Corning, Palantir, and Nextracker.

It is fully sold out for this year and, after ramping up production in H2 at its modern factory completed a year ago, it expects to break even in EBITDA for the year.

This isn’t surprising.

The AI Era

AI is creating a massive energy deficit in the US. Just check the latest DOE report.

100 GW of new peak hour supply will be needed by 2030, with 50 GW directly attributable to data centers.

It takes three times longer to build the generation capacity required for a data center than to complete the data center buildout itself.

The rest of the DOE document focuses more on oil, gas, coal, and nuclear than on renewables or batteries, but the administration still recognizes that all energy sources are necessary, serving complementary roles.

IRA 45X Credits

Although the current administration isn’t rhetorically supportive of renewable energy, the IRA 45X manufacturing credits for clean energy production introduced by the Joe Biden administration were preserved by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, with some modifications.

Here are the requirements and credit amounts for the IRA 45X manufacturing credits, which provide great incentives for U.S. clean energy production and help boost the profitability of domestic manufacturers:

Covered U.S. Production

Solar components (polysilicon, wafers, cells, modules), wind components, inverters, battery cells, battery modules, electrode-active materials, and critical minerals.

Credit Amounts

Battery cells: $35/kWh

Battery modules: $10/kWh (or $45/kWh if no cells)

Solar cells: $0.04/Wdc

Solar modules: $0.07/Wdc

Electrode-active materials: 10% of production cost

Inverters: fixed $/Wac rates

Monetization

Direct pay in cash or a one-time annual transfer or sale of the credit.

Phaseout

75% in 2030

50% in 2031

25% in 2032

Ends after 2032

Wind components end after 2027

Critical minerals follow the 2030–2032 phase-down.

Key Rules

Manufacturing must take place in the United States, and the product must be sold to an unrelated buyer.

US Manufacturing: A powerful trend

This administration is also focused on U.S.-based manufacturing. To achieve that, it is implementing an aggressive import restriction plan, particularly on Chinese goods. Here are some of the key restrictions currently in place:

China solar tariffs (AD/CVD): The U.S. has long-running extra import taxes on Chinese solar cells and panels, and they were kept in 2024, so China-made panels stay expensive at the border. (USTIC)

Southeast Asia tariffs (AD/CVD): As of Apr 21, 2025, the U.S. set company-specific tariffs on cells/panels from Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam when they rely on Chinese inputs—meaning many SEA-made panels now face new duties. (Trade.gov)

2022–2024 “tariff holiday” status: The two-year pause on collecting some SEA solar duties expired Jun 6, 2024; a court later vacated that pause but put the ruling on hold while the government appeals, so retroactive collection risk is paused for now. (Trade.gov)

Section 301 on China—finished panels/cells: The U.S. raised tariffs on Chinese solar cells (whether or not in modules) to 50%—a big price hit on any direct China-origin cells/panels. (United States Trade Representative)

Section 301 on China—wafers & polysilicon: Chinese wafers and polysilicon now face 50% tariffs (effective Jan 1, 2025), making upstream China inputs far costlier. (United States Trade Representative)

Section 201 solar safeguard: A separate safeguard runs through early 2026. It allows about 5 GW of cells/year duty-free (tariff-rate quota), while modules remain under safeguard; bifacial modules are exempt. (White & Case)

UFLPA forced-labor ban: If any part of a panel’s supply chain ties to Xinjiang or a listed entity (e.g., in the polysilicon chain), U.S. Customs can block the shipment unless the importer proves it’s clean. The entity list expanded in 2025. (Department of Homeland Security)

And what about demand?

In March 2025, U.S. solar power generation increased by 37% (+8.3 TWh) compared to March 2024.

Wind and solar combined produced a record 17% of U.S. electricity in 2024, surpassing coal at 15% for the first time.

Solar remains the fastest-growing renewable source thanks to larger capacity additions and favorable tax credit policies. Planned projects are expected to boost capacity operated by the electric power sector 38%, from 95 GW at the end of 2023 to 131 GW by the end of 2024.

Solar and storage represented 84% of new U.S. power added in 2024.

Macro Tailwinds

Another key factor is that solar is sensitive to interest rates, as most projects rely on financing. The FED started cutting rates a year ago, and now the cuts are expected to accelerate. Along with the transition from quantitative tightening to quantitative easing signaled in recent meetings, this points to liquidity relief for solar projects, boosting the industry and panel prices.

There are two strong themes emerging in the U.S.: energy and U.S. manufacturing. Solar is a crucial part of solving the massive energy demand driven by AI, especially to reach superintelligence.

For that reason, I believe this company presents a compelling opportunity to scale from a microcap to a mid-cap and deliver multibagger returns in the process.","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Qhch!,w_1200,h_600,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffcd52299-7e62-42ae-897e-beba0421d9a5_800x554.jpeg",N,,2025-10-29 05:57:49.033816

Far from Gulf Coast hurricanes and California wildfires, Chicagoland seems like a safe place to be in a warming world. But is it?

""There's really no place in the world that is truly a climate haven. It's more a matter of picking your poison,"" said climate researcher Dr. Kirstina Dahl. ""My top concerns would probably be increased flood risk.""

Heavy rain is now 10% heavier than it was in 1970. Just this summer, 500-year and 1,000-year rain events devastated Chicago neighborhoods.

""And I would also worry about the wildfire smoke,"" Dr. Dahl said.

As nearby Canada heats up, vegetation dries out, leading to record-setting wildfire seasons.

""We are seeing a significant number of days with wildfire smoke in the Chicago area,"" Dr. Dahl said.

Forty-five to 50 each year, according to Climate Central. That's one day a week when unhealthy wildfire smoke is present, affecting breathable air.

""Babies can be born with breathing issues because their mothers were exposed to intense wildfire smoke during their pregnancies,"" Dr. Dahl said.

What about access to fresh water? As supplies dwindle in other parts of the country, Chicagoans have Lake Michigan. The Great Lakes hold 84% of surface freshwater in North America and supply drinking water for 40 million people, including the Chicago area.

While the water won't run out anytime soon, lake temperatures have been heating up.

David Wright, a physical scientist with the Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory, who studies the Great Lakes, said 2024 featured the warmest surface water temperatures in their 30 years of record-keeping.

""Trying to understand how a change in that water temperature plays in the atmosphere,"" he said.

Wright said a warmer lake can warm Chicago area temperatures, affect thunderstorm patterns, and fuel bigger lake effect snow events when winter comes around.

""One of the things that often gets left out of these discussions of climate havens is, a haven for whom?"" Dr. Dahl said. ""Maybe it is if you can afford an air purifier that can run on smoky days. Maybe it is if you can flood-proof your home or raise your home, but there are a lot of people for whom those aren't options.""

Reliant representative met with the County Commission about CO2 development

A company official with Reliant Carbon Capture & Storage (Reliant CCS) appeared before the Covington County Commission today to introduce the Pine Hills Storage Hub, a project designed to safely and permanently store carbon dioxide (CO2) deep underground while creating jobs and supporting Alabama’s growing energy needs.

The Pine Hills Storage Hub will also help attract new industries and investment to Covington County by providing manufacturers and power producers with a local, safe solution for managing carbon emissions.

The project will create local construction-related jobs and long-term technical positions while helping strengthen the region’s industrial competitiveness.

It is being developed on forestland in southern Covington County in collaboration with Rayonier, Inc., a timberland management firm that has operated in the area for more than two decades. Rayonier will retain ownership of the property. Because the CO2 will be stored thousands of feet underground, the land above will remain productive working forestland and continue to support timber, hunting and recreation.

“Reliant is proud to bring this important investment to Covington County,” said Bestor Ward, a Reliant CCS official. “This project strengthens the local economy and helps ensure we can continue using reliable, American-made energy, which will keep energy costs stable and more affordable for families and businesses. Reliant is committed to maximizing participation by local businesses and workers in this project. We look forward to working with local leaders and residents every step of the way.”

Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is a proven, regulated technology that has been used safely for decades across the United States and the world. The process captures CO2 from power plants and industrial sources before it enters the atmosphere, compresses it into a liquid-like form, and stores it thousands of feet underground in secure geologic formations sealed by thick, natural layers of rock.

The Pine Hills site was chosen following geological testing that confirmed the area’s underground rock formations are ideal for permanent CO2 storage.

“The geology at the site is ideal for efficient, safe and permanent CO2 storage,” said Dr. Andrew Duguid, Vice President of Advanced Resources International, a research and consulting firm for the oil and gas industry.

Reliant has applied for a Class VI permit from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the strictest and highest level of federal oversight and monitoring for carbon storage.

“Transparency and community involvement are central to how we operate,” Ward said. “We will hold community meetings, provide information about the project and listen to the questions and ideas of local residents. We are here to provide information and be transparent. We are not asking the commission for anything. Our goal is to make Pine Hills a project the community can take pride in for generations.”

The two-day Forum opened with plenary remarks from New Jersey State Senator Anthony Bucco, Dr. Tony Iacono, President of County College of Morris, and Kristen Bowman Kavanagh, Executive Director of the Delaware River Basin Commission.

A morning panel, “The State of the Watershed During a Shifting Landscape,” brought together Friends of the Upper Delaware River, New Jersey Future, PennFuture, Delaware Nature Society, and Ducks Unlimited for a discussion on changes under the federal administration, shifting foundation funding, and emerging state policy challenges.

The Forum also featured Congressman Tom Kean, Jr. (NJ-7) and NJDEP Deputy Commissioner Kati Angarone during the networking lunch plenary, followed by an interactive session titled “Finding Our Common Ground & Harnessing Our Collective Strength.”

Through small-group discussions and activities, attendees identified shared priorities and explored opportunities to strengthen the Coalition’s collective impact.

The day concluded with a closing plenary featuring Kim Gaddy, Founder and Director of the South Ward Environmental Alliance, and Grant LaRouche, Senior Director of Regional Collaboration (Mid-Atlantic) for the National Wildlife Federation.

On Friday, participants joined field trips across northwestern New Jersey highlighting local conservation and education initiatives, including a hike along the James Leach Boardwalk Trail to Liffy Island, an eco-cruise on Lake Hopatcong led by the Lake Hopatcong Foundation, and a guided walk along the Wild and Scenic Musconetcong River to learn about restoration and community partnership efforts by the Musconetcong Watershed Association.

“Thank you to the Coalition for the Delaware River Watershed for inviting me to speak on the importance of safeguarding our environment and promoting healthy ecosystems,” said Congressman Tom Kean, Jr. “From my time at the Environmental Protection Agency where I met my wife Rhonda, to the New Jersey State Legislature and now in Congress, I have made it a priority to support policies that preserve clean water, protect open space, and strengthen our infrastructure. We must continue to work together to protect the natural resources we depend on today, so that our children and grandchildren can continue to enjoy them in the future in the great Garden State.”

“The Delaware River Basin is part of our identity, and protecting its water quality, habitats, and infrastructure isn’t just about environmental stewardship, it’s about public health and economic resilience for generations to come,” said New Jersey State Senator Anthony Bucco. “By bringing every voice to the table, as the Coalition does through events like the Delaware River Watershed Forum, we continue to build a stronger, more connected watershed that truly serves everyone.”

“It is wonderful to welcome representatives from so many of the 199 organizations that make up the Coalition for the Delaware River Watershed to Northwestern New Jersey,” said Marty Kane, Co-Chair of the Coalition for the Delaware River Watershed. “As home of the Musconetcong River and Lake Hopatcong, this is a perfect place to share thoughts and ideas to safeguard the watershed’s future. Protecting and improving the watershed are common goals that unite us all in ensuring clean water and the enjoyment of this magnificent resource by everyone.”

“The County College of Morris is proud to have supported our colleagues from the Delaware Watershed by serving as the host site for their annual meeting”, said Dr. Anthony Iacono, President of the County College of Morris. “Their critically important work has a tremendous impact on millions of lives and communities across five states. In this way, and many others, they share our mission of changing lives and strengthening communities.""

For these interests, the only question is which kinds of nuclear reactors to develop, and how fast.
Without a civilian nuclear industry, military nuclear capabilities are significantly more challenging and costly to sustain.
Nuclear submarines are especially important here as they would very likely require national reactor industries and their supply chains even if there was no civil nuclear power.
French president Emmanuel Macron put it clearly: “Without civilian nuclear, no military nuclear, without military nuclear, no civilian nuclear.” Across these states, military nuclear capabilities are seen as a way to stay at the world’s “top table.” An end to their civilian program would threaten not just jobs and energy but their great power status, as well.","Donald Trump’s recent visit to the UK saw a so-called “landmark partnership” on nuclear energy. London and Washington announced plans to build 20 small modular reactors and also develop microreactor technology – despite the fact no such plants have yet been built commercially anywhere in the world.

The UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, promised these plans will deliver a “golden age” of nuclear energy that will also “drive down bills.” Yet the history of nuclear power has been decades of overhype, soaring costs and constant delays. Around the world, the trends point the wrong way.

So why the renewed excitement about going nuclear? The real reasons have less to do with energy security, or climate change – and far more to do with military power.

At first sight, the case may seem obvious. Nuclear supporters frame small modular reactors, or SMRs, as vital for cutting emissions, meeting rising demand for electricity from cars and data centres. With large nuclear plants now prohibitively expensive, smaller reactors are billed as an exciting new alternative.

But these days even the most optimistic industry analyses concede that nuclear – even SMRs – is unlikely to compete with renewables. One analysis in New Civil Engineer published earlier this year concluded that SMRs are “the most expensive source per kilowatt of electricity generated when compared with natural gas, traditional nuclear and renewables.”

Independent assessments – for instance by the formerly pro-nuclear Royal Society – find that 100% renewable systems outperform any energy system including nuclear on cost, flexibility and security. This helps explain why worldwide statistical analysis shows nuclear power is not generally linked to carbon emissions reductions, while renewables are.

Partly, the enthusiasm for SMRs can be explained by the loudest institutional voices tending to have formal pro-nuclear remits or interests. They include the industry itself and its suppliers, nuclear agencies and governments with entrenched military nuclear programs.

For these interests, the only question is which kinds of nuclear reactors to develop, and how fast. They don’t wonder if we should build reactors in the first place. The need is seen as self-evident.

At least big nuclear reactors have benefited from economies of scale and decades of technological optimisation. Many SMR designs are just “powerpoint reactors,” existing only in slides and feasibility studies. Claims these unbuilt designs “will cost less” are speculative at best.

Investment markets know this. While financiers see SMR hype as a way to profit from billions in government subsidies, their own analyses are less enthusiastic about the technology itself.

So why then, all this attention to nuclear in general and smaller reactors in particular? There is clearly more to this than meets the eye.

The hidden link

The neglected factor is the military dependence on civil nuclear industries. Maintaining a nuclear armed navy or weapons program requires constant access to generic reactor technologies, skilled workers and special materials. Without a civilian nuclear industry, military nuclear capabilities are significantly more challenging and costly to sustain.

Nuclear submarines are especially important here as they would very likely require national reactor industries and their supply chains even if there was no civil nuclear power. Barely affordable even vessel by vessel, nuclear submarines become even more expensive when the costs of this “submarine industrial base” is factored in.

Rolls-Royce is an important link here, as it already builds the UK’s submarine reactors and is set to build the newly announced civil SMRs. The company said openly in 2017 that a civil SMR programme would “relieve the Ministry of Defense of the burden of developing and retaining skills and capability.”

Here, as emphasized by Nuclear Intelligence Weekly in 2020, the Rolls-Royce SMR programme has an important “symbiosis with UK military needs.” It is this dependency that allows military costs (in the words of a former executive with submarine builders BAE Systems) to be “masked” behind civilian programs.

By funding civil nuclear projects, taxpayers and consumers cover military uses of nuclear power in subsidies and higher bills – without the added spending appearing in defense budgets.

When the UK government funded us to investigate the value of this transfer, we put it at around £5 billion (US$6.6 billion) per year in the UK alone. These costs are masked from public view, covered by revenues from higher electricity prices and the budgets of supposedly civilian government agencies.

This is not a conspiracy but a kind of political gravitational field. Once governments see nuclear weapons as a marker of global status, the funding and political support becomes self-perpetuating.

The result is a strange sort of circularity: nuclear power is justified by energy security and cost arguments that don’t stand up, but it is in reality sustained for strategic reasons that remain unacknowledged.

A global pattern

The UK is not unique, although other nuclear powers are much more candid. US energy secretary Chris Wright described the US-UK nuclear deal as important for “securing nuclear supply chains across the Atlantic.” Around $25 billion a year flows from civil to military nuclear activity in the US.

Russia and China are both quite open about their own inseparable civil-military links. French president Emmanuel Macron put it clearly: “Without civilian nuclear, no military nuclear, without military nuclear, no civilian nuclear.”

Across these states, military nuclear capabilities are seen as a way to stay at the world’s “top table.” An end to their civilian program would threaten not just jobs and energy but their great power status, as well.

The next frontier

Beyond submarines, the development of “microreactors” is opening up new military uses for nuclear power. Microreactors are even smaller and more experimental than SMRs. Although they can make profits by milking military procurement budgets, they make no sense from a commercial energy standpoint.

However, microreactors are seen as essential in US plans for battlefield power, space infrastructure and new “high energy” anti-drone and missile weaponry. Prepare to see them become ever more prominent in “civil” debates – precisely because they serve military goals.

Whatever view is taken of these military developments, it makes no sense to pretend they are unrelated to the civil nuclear sector. The real drivers of the recent US-UK nuclear agreement lie in military projection of force, not civilian power production. Yet this remains absent from most discussions of energy policy.

It is a crucial matter of democracy that there be honesty about what is really going on.

Since launching its first electric trucks in 2019, Volvo has delivered more than 5,700 electric vehicles across 50 countries, which have collectively driven 250 million kilometers (155 million miles). Volvo Trucks continues to hold a leading position globally and has maintained an average of over 30% market share in the North American electric truck segment over the past five years.

“Reaching this milestone is a testament to our customers’ commitment to sustainable transportation and our dealer network’s dedication to supporting them every step of the way,” said Peter Voorhoeve, president, Volvo Trucks North America. “The path to zero emissions is shaped by market conditions, which are moving slowly. We remain committed to our vision to create a world we want to live in by using zero emissions solutions in combination with fuel efficient combustion engines with reduced climate impact. Solutions that will work for our clients where sustainability meets affordability.”

83 Certified EV dealerships across North America

Since TEC Equipment – Fontana became the first Volvo Trucks Certified EV Dealer in July 2021, the network has expanded rapidly to 83 certified locations across 33 U.S. states and four Canadian provinces. The latest additions bring four new states—Colorado, Louisiana, Maryland, and Nevada—and four new dealer groups into the program. Another 13 locations are currently in the certification pipeline.

Certified dealers complete extensive EV training and invest in facility upgrades to deliver full sales and service support for battery-electric trucks.

Cutting CO₂ Across All Drivelines

Volvo Trucks is advancing cleaner and more efficient solutions across its entire product range. In North America, the all-new Volvo VNL delivers up to 10% better fuel efficiency than its predecessor. For a truck running 120,000 miles per year, that translates to about 1,300 fewer gallons of fuel and a reduction of roughly 30,000 pounds of CO₂.

Fuel-efficient combustion engines that can also run on renewable fuels are one part of Volvo Trucks’ three-path approach to decarbonization—together with battery-electric and fuel-cell electric trucks.

Comprehensive Electric Portfolio Worldwide

Volvo Trucks’ electric vehicles are now operating in 50 countries, with the strongest markets in Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and the United States. Globally, the company offers eight fully electric truck models designed to meet the needs of diverse applications—from urban distribution and waste management to regional haul and construction. These models include the Volvo FL Electric, FE Electric, FM Electric, FM Low Entry, FMX Electric, FH Electric, FH Aero Electric, and the VNR Electric.

How it all started…

Volvo Trucks’ leadership in zero-tailpipe emission transportation began with the launch of the Volvo VNR Electric as part of the pioneering Volvo LIGHTS Project. The $90 million public-private partnership laid the foundation for the widespread adoption of heavy-duty battery-electric trucks by exploring the infrastructure and operational adaptations required to support electromobility. Volvo Trucks is also a key partner in California’s Joint Electric Truck Scaling Initiative (JETSI), which deployed Class 8 battery-electric trucks across Southern California to demonstrate strategies to successfully scale market penetration of zero emission technologies.

Instead, Maryland should embrace competition, innovation and accountability from power distributors, generators and utility regulators.","Adam Dubitsky serves as state director for the Land & Liberty Coalition of Maryland, a project of the nonprofit, nonpartisan Conservative Energy Network.

Months out from the 2026 Maryland General Assembly Session, state lawmakers are already being lobbied by Exelon and its subsidiary, Baltimore Gas and Electric, to undo two decades of “deregulated” energy policy and return to the days when a single monopoly could control both power generation and the wires that carry electricity to our homes and businesses. A perennial ask of BGE, recent articles indicate the company believes the massive rate spikes coinciding with the 2025 Session will help convince Annapolis that it is time to end the Free State’s quarter-century of deregulated energy markets. This is the last thing Maryland ratepayers need.

The state’s largest power utility, BGE argues that allowing them to also generate the power they distribute in Maryland would lead to lower costs, faster deployment of new power plants, greater reliability and more renewable energy. In reality, “reregulation” would likely drive up bills, stifle competition and choke off investments in the low-cost in-state energy Maryland urgently needs.

In a recent Newsweek op-ed, Exelon CEO Calvin Butler echoed late-summer remarks by BGE’s Tamla Olivier in the Baltimore Business Journal, claiming that expanding his monopoly’s control would yield “predictable, lower costs” for ratepayers. Let’s hope state lawmakers remember that the same company now lobbying for reregulation failed to predict its own skyrocketing distribution costs that blindsided constituents earlier this year.

When utility projects run over budget, it’s ratepayers who pay. In competitive markets, solar, wind and storage developers must outbid one another, innovate and deliver on time. That competition puts downward pressure on costs. Maryland should not trade that discipline for a blank check to BGE.

Maryland boasts of being a renewable energy leader when in reality the state ranks a distant 38th nationally for its share of electricity consumed that comes from renewable sources — about 8.9%. Yet there’s no reason to believe allowing a company synonymous with cost overruns and delays to build and own power plants would help close this yawning gap between Maryland’s renewable aspirations and reality. Combined with high taxes, burdensome regulations and county-level NIMBYism, reregulation would further discourage private investment in clean energy. That means less low-cost power, fewer jobs and higher power bills for families and employers.

Contrary to the narrative of many BGE State House allies, Maryland especially needs more large-scale solar development. Even with federal incentives expiring, utility-scale solar projects built today have the lowest levelized cost of energy — the gold standard measure of a project’s economics. That is, they are the cheapest source of energy both to build and operate, and that’s as true in the Southwest as it is here in the mid-Atlantic. Faster to deploy and far less expensive than new fossil plants, or subsidy-dependent solar on commercial rooftops, brownfields or parking canopies, these projects also bring much-needed revenue to rural counties without the permanent impact of residential sprawl.

BGE’s CEO correctly notes that Maryland should generate more of its own power rather than importing from neighboring states, but the answer is not to hand the keys to a distribution monopoly.

Instead, Maryland should embrace competition, innovation and accountability from power distributors, generators and utility regulators. A good place to start would be strengthening interconnection rules, accelerating renewable permitting and ensuring competitive bidding for new capacity. This will help expand opportunities across a wide spectrum: more utility-scale solar to harvest free sunlight, battery storage solutions to bank power when it’s cheap for use during expensive peak loads, investment in demand-response technologies and upgrading Nixon-era transmission lines to today’s advanced conductors that can carry twice the power.

Read More in Generation

Lawmakers should resist letting BGE rewrite the rules in its favor. Instead, they should create a stable, predictable regulatory environment that allows private developers to compete to bring the lowest-cost, cleanest and most dependable projects online while encouraging ongoing innovation.

The choice is clear: Lawmakers can either side with Maryland families and businesses, or hand more power and control to the power distribution monopolies. It’s time to stand with consumers.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/1TtaKge23B2zvSS3B6KiyVhmrYqO0DMWCgLW7FvRPyE/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy00NzQ5NjY0MzYuanBn.webp,N,,2025-10-29 06:58:41.860020

That's not the only reason people in Louisiana could see higher utility bills — state officials who approved the plan admit the increased energy demand from the site could, in turn, increase gas prices.
The Hopkins family showed CBS News their power bills, which indicated the fuel costs on their bill went up by about $13 a month compared to last year.
Some customers in at least 13 states are seeing higher utility bills because of new data centers, according to the Institute of Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.
Entergy has said that Meta coming to Louisiana will actually mean lower customer power bills, adding in a statement that resilience upgrades could reduce electricity bills by 10%.","Lisa Hopkins bought her house in Louisiana's Richland Parish two years ago, but lately, her family only finds peace and quiet on their front porch at night, after construction stops for the day.

That's because Meta, the company that owns Facebook and Instagram, is now building its largest artificial intelligence data center in the country right across the street.

""It's always noise, all the time,"" Hopkins told CBS News, adding, ""We honestly didn't know how big of a scale it was gonna be... Some mornings it's hard to get out of our driveway, just because of all the dump trucks.""

Louisiana approved the $10 billion project in August, saying it would bring ""hope"" for economic growth.

But some experts say the center's power demands will raise customers' power bills statewide. The state's main utility company — Entergy — agreed to pay for a $550 million transmission line to the center, a cost that experts say will be passed on to the 1.1 million customers under Entergy Louisiana's umbrella. This, in a parish where nearly a quarter of the population lives in poverty, according to the state's utility commission.

That's not the only reason people in Louisiana could see higher utility bills — state officials who approved the plan admit the increased energy demand from the site could, in turn, increase gas prices.

""This single data center is set to span an amount of land that is about 70 football fields worth of land, and it's going to consume roughly three times the amount of electricity that the entire city of New Orleans consumes on an annual basis,"" Paul Arbaje, an energy analyst with the nonprofit Union of Concerned Scientists, told CBS News.

The Hopkins family showed CBS News their power bills, which indicated the fuel costs on their bill went up by about $13 a month compared to last year.

As the nationwide construction boom in new data centers continues, other communities are already feeling the impacts. Some customers in at least 13 states are seeing higher utility bills because of new data centers, according to the Institute of Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.

""We're all kind of sharing the pain in that fight,"" Arbaje said. ""It's up to state regulators, really, to step in and protect consumers and make sure that tech companies and utility companies are paying their fair share for this development.""

Meta's head of community development in North America, Katie Comer, said they're working with Entergy to reduce customer impacts, telling CBS News that Meta has ""invested a million dollars into their bill pay assistance program to support low-income families.""

Asked about concerns from residents that Meta is imposing on the neighborhood, Comer said, ""We are actively on the ground every day. We want to listen and learn and meet the community where they're at.""

Comer added Meta is also investing $200 million into local infrastructure projects and partnering with local school programs to help the community's long-term development.

""This community as a whole is incredibly special,"" Comer said. ""We've been very proud of the work that we've been able to do together. I am extremely excited about the work that we will do in the future together.""

Entergy has said that Meta coming to Louisiana will actually mean lower customer power bills, adding in a statement that resilience upgrades could reduce electricity bills by 10%.

Resident Donna Collins, who has lived in the region her entire life, said she hopes it's true, ""but I'm going to have to see it to believe it.""

Collins told CBS News that she felt outreach by the state and Meta for local input was sorely lacking.

""I definitely don't feel like I had a say, and I don't know many people that do,"" she said.

Hopkins said she never received any notices about public hearings in the mail.

The company said that the government should accelerate transmission line construction using existing tools such as the DOE’s Loan Programs Office, the US Department of Agriculture’s Rural Utilities Service loans, DOE’s Grid Resilience and Innovation Partnerships (GRIP) program grants, and Power Marketing Administration financing.

Some of those programs, including the loan office, saw significant layoffs earlier this year.

Wholf",,,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bill-gates-climate-change-criticizes-doomsday-view/,"Gates described climate change as the most formidable challenge humanity has ever faced.
He told Anderson Cooper in a ""60 Minutes"" interview that same year that climate change is ""way greater than the pandemic.
Some agreed that climate change isn't the greatest threat to humanity, while others slammed the memo for understating the consequences of climate change.
Gallaudet believes moving away from ""climate doomsday alarmism"" and focusing on adaptation and technological improvements to forecasting is beneficial, more realistic, and practical.
He said that climate change is a problem, but it doesn't pose the existential threat that some have cautioned.","For decades, Bill Gates has warned of climate disaster — but his tone meaningfully shifted Tuesday as the billionaire Microsoft co-founder cautioned against taking a ""doomsday view"" on the planet's future.

In a memo posted online, Gates wrote that while climate change is still a major problem that needs to be solved, ""People will be able to live and thrive on Earth for the foreseeable future."" Gates, who has invested billions developing green technologies to cut greenhouse gases, says doomsday climate scenarios over-emphasize cutting emissions while ""diverting resources from the most effective things we should be doing to improve life in a warming world.""

The lengthy memo essentially argued that we should continue to innovate and back climate breakthroughs but not at the expense of funding for global health or development — ""programs that help people stay resilient in the face of climate change."" He argued for putting ""human welfare at the center of our climate strategies,"" including improving health and agriculture in the world's poorest countries.

In years past, Gates, the author of ""How to Avoid a Climate Disaster,"" struck a more alarmist tone.

In an interview with CBS News' Norah O'Donnell in 2021, he warned: ""If we don't reduce emissions, then the death toll would be even worse near the equator, and the unrest would be global in nature."" He added, ""You've got to start work now to avoid those terrible consequences much later.""

Gates described climate change as the most formidable challenge humanity has ever faced. He told Anderson Cooper in a ""60 Minutes"" interview that same year that climate change is ""way greater than the pandemic. And it needs a level of cooperation that would be unprecedented.""

Gates has personally invested over $2 billion in green technology and launched Breakthrough Energy Ventures, a firm formed with other billionaires to fund research and technology aimed at finding solutions to reduce carbon emissions.

Gates' memo drew a mixed response. Some agreed that climate change isn't the greatest threat to humanity, while others slammed the memo for understating the consequences of climate change.

Dr. Katharine Hayhoe, climate scientist and professor at Texas Tech University, says the problem of climate change cannot be separated from the other major threats that humanity faces because it contributes to them, including in the developing world.

""Just give me a list of people's top 10 things to worry about, and I can tell you how climate change is making every single one of those top 10 things worse,"" she said.

Dr. Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California Agriculture and Natural Resources, called the memo a ""breathtaking misread"" that lacks an understanding of what it would mean for the world to experience 2 or 3 degrees Celsius of warming.

""I think it grossly misrepresents the magnitude of the consequences we're going to see, ironically, for the same people the memo claims to be looking out for — the global poor.""

Timothy Gallaudet, a retired Rear Admiral who oversaw weather forecasting for the U.S. Navy, questions some climate assessments, including doomsday scenarios.

""Ultimately, there's real impacts, but so much is reported erroneously,"" he said. ""There's so much misinformation in the climate space now, it's a real shame.""

Gallaudet believes moving away from ""climate doomsday alarmism"" and focusing on adaptation and technological improvements to forecasting is beneficial, more realistic, and practical.

Ted Nordhaus is founder and executive director of global research center Breakthrough Institute (not to be confused with Gates' Breakthrough Energy). He said that climate change is a problem, but it doesn't pose the existential threat that some have cautioned.

In a column for The Free Press (which, like CBS News, is owned by Paramount Skydance), Nordhaus wrote that climate tipping points like the melting of ice sheets and the deforestation of the Amazon ""don't add up to catastrophic outcomes for humanity.""

Per Nordhaus, scientific evidence doesn't suggest climate change is the greatest threat facing humanity, and it shouldn't take top consideration when the world has already proven it can adapt to a warming atmosphere.

""We've always adapted, that's why we have humans living across huge variances in climatic zones,"" he told CBS News. ""I think the point of Gates' letter is we're actually making a fair amount of progress here to reduce emissions and continuing to be more resilient.""

With the global climate summit known as COP30 coming up next month in Brazil, Gates urged world leaders, business and activists to chart a new path forward.

""This is a chance to refocus on the metric that should count even more than emissions and temperature change: improving lives,"" he wrote.",https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/10/28/fb7344bc-3994-4c55-9b15-8fa3bd1fea0b/thumbnail/1200x630/9b5b1f776ce8e6824160e3ad03e2c459/gettyimages-2237146061.jpg,N,,2025-10-28 21:59:36.500142

“If successful, this will support our plans to accelerate development of our site at Kawerau,” said Foresta business development manager Dean Ormond.

The company said the planned facility could employ more than 75 people once operational.

“Foresta welcomes the Government’s commitment to the role of bioenergy in helping meet New Zealand’s energy and climate challenges,” Ormond said. “It’s critical that New Zealand makes more of its considerable forestry resources. Foresta is keen to play its part and is pressing ahead with plans for its torrefied wood processing facility in Kawerau.”

Kawerau mayor-elect Faylene Tunui also welcomed the project, saying its blend of economic growth and environmental stewardship — kaitiaki taiao — was “great news for Kawerau and Aotearoa New Zealand.”

Foresta said torrefied wood pellets have strong potential to replace coal at Huntly Power Station and in other industrial processes requiring high-temperature energy.

East Coast MP Dana Kirkpatrick added that the Government’s wood energy initiatives have a strong regional focus.

“This is great news for the Eastern Bay of Plenty, which is leading the charge in this space with Foresta recently announcing its new wood pellet plant,” she said. “Forestry waste like woody debris has long been a challenge for our region — clogging waterways and damaging infrastructure. Now we have the opportunity to turn that problem into a solution by creating a market and destination for this material.”

The Wood Energy Strategy, led by Watts and Forestry Minister Todd McClay, aims to scale up the use of wood residues from forestry and manufacturing as a clean, affordable energy source for industrial heat and electricity generation.

The plan targets replacing up to 40 percent of fossil-fuelled process heat by 2050, significantly cutting emissions and creating regional economic opportunities.

MICHIGAN HEALTHY CLIMATE PLAN

*************************

Michigan Lt.-Gov. Garlin Gilchrist II today joined a celebration of community-led climate and environmental justice action 12 months in the making: the successful close of the first year of Michigan's Justice40 Accelerator and the announcement that the program will continue for a second year with a new name.

The newly named MI Healthy Climate Community Accelerator (Community Accelerator) will further center community-led climate action on the goals in the state’s Michigan Healthy Climate Plan (MHCP). The MHCP commits the state to becoming carbon neutral by 2050 in a just and equitable manner. This includes ensuring that Michigan’s historically disadvantaged communities benefit from at least 40% of state funding for climate and water infrastructure – the meaning of the term Justice40.

“Gov. (Gretchen) Whitmer and I are committed to building a healthier Michigan where everyone can succeed,” Gilchrist said. “Thanks to our work on clean energy, we’re creating good-paying jobs and protecting our environment. The MI Healthy Climate Community Accelerator will help us build on that progress and continue supporting community-based organizations who are working on the frontlines of the future to grow our economy, achieve our climate goals, and invest in our cities and towns. Let’s keep Standing Tall so every Michigander can thrive.”

The accelerator program launched in October 2024 to support 25 community-based organizations selected from frontline communities across Michigan in building capacity for enduring and equitable climate action. Frontline communities experience the impacts of climate change “first and worst” and are often historically disadvantaged.

In its first year, the program provided participation funding, one-on-one technical assistance, training, and partnership-building opportunities to participating organizations.

The members of the accelerator cohort (listed below) were chosen based in part on project ideas for equitably addressing climate change in their communities. Projects ranged from electric vehicle ride share infrastructure to energy efficient home development to youth engagement and training programs.

Members of the cohort submitted more than 35 public funding applications and built their organizational capacity through resource and technical assistance support. Eligible to apply were Michigan-based nonprofits, cooperatives, fiscally sponsored projects, and tribal-serving organizations with 501(c)(3) status operating in or serving qualifying communities.

The Office of Climate and Energy (OCE) and the Office of the Environmental Justice Public Advocate (OEJPA) in the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy (EGLE) launched the 12-month accelerator in partnership with equitable clean energy nonprofit Elevate and the Michigan Environmental Justice Coalition (MEJC). Elevate operates the program with MEJC subcontracted for support and community engagement.

Gearing up for 2026

In the year ahead, EGLE will continue supporting cohort members with ongoing climate and environmental justice goals in alignment with the MHCP. The program is being reimagined using feedback from cohort members and in consideration of the changing landscape in policy and funding for climate and environmental justice work.

Through the Community Accelerator, participants will set goals to advance climate-related missions or projects, connect to available resources, and build stronger partnerships across Michigan communities and sectors.

The continuing cohort is expected to launch programming in February and continue through Dec. 31, 2026.

“This important initiative will continue to empower communities with the greatest needs to acquire the resources for local action to protect our air, land, and water and improve public health and quality of life,” said EGLE Director Phil Roos. “EGLE remains committed to a more sustainable future for all Michiganders and for generations to come.”

“Partnering with EGLE for another year of the MI Healthy Climate Community Accelerator underscores our commitment to advancing equitable climate solutions,” said Elevate CEO Dr. Anne Evens. “Together, we’re helping communities build resilience, develop creative approaches to extreme weather, and ensure families across Michigan can thrive.”

“The Michigan Environmental Justice Coalition is excited to work together again with our partners at EGLE and Elevate on a second year of MI Healthy Climate Community Accelerator,” said MEJC Program Manager Latia Leonard. “I’m excited for the opportunity to continue our momentum of relationship building, engagement, and learning as a community from year one. Year two of the Community Accelerator will be set on a strong foundation.”

The automotive industry is constantly changing. Although electric vehicles are gaining increasing popularity worldwide, in the US they face serious challenges. The federal government no longer subsidizes them, internal combustion engine vehicles do not carry severe penalties for violating economic standards, and the average price of electric vehicles remains higher. Despite this, former Ford CEO Mark Fields is confident that electric vehicle adoption will continue to gradually increase.

Growth Prospects

During an interview with CNBC on Friday, Fields stated that he expects “gradual growth” in demand for electric vehicles following the Trump administration’s decision in September to discontinue $7,500 tax credits for new and $4,000 credits for used electric vehicles. The former Ford leader, who headed the company from 2014 to 2017, believes that long-term implementation remains inevitable as consumers increasingly transition to renewable energy sources.

You will see these rates increase over time, but not at the pace automakers expected. That is why you see the large write-offs that Ford, GM, and others have made.

GM announced that it is making a $1.6 billion write-off related to the “strategic reformatting” of its electric vehicle development plan.

Management Views

Current Ford CEO Jim Farley also stated earlier this month that the loss of tax credits could cut US electric vehicle sales in half in the near term. Like Fields, Farley believes that adoption rates will continue to grow with the emergence of more affordable models. The former executive noted that automakers “rushed into electrification” without fully understanding consumer demand.

You will see more write-offs in the future as the industry adapts to the new demand curve.

Alternative Opinions

However, not everyone agrees that the cancellation of subsidies will impact adoption as significantly as expected. Former Tesla global sales head John McNeill told CNBC earlier this month that European markets continued to grow despite similar subsidy reductions. Thus, there is a possibility that the American market could recover as buyers adapt to the new prices.

The transition to electric vehicles remains a complex goal for automakers, especially amid regulatory changes and economic uncertainty. However, long-term trends such as decreasing battery costs and expanding charging infrastructure may contribute to further development of this sector. Automakers will likely need to balance investments in electrification with maintaining traditional product lines to meet diverse market needs.",https://topgir.com.ua/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/mustang-mach-e_car-wash_09-copy-1024x576-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-28 21:59:33.327324

NINA MOINI: This month, the utility companies Great River Energy and Minnesota Power broke ground in Becker on new power lines. It's part of a large project to update the region's power grid, which helps move along the state's plan to reduce its carbon footprint.

But North Dakota filed a federal complaint to stop it, saying that their residents should not have to pay higher rates to subsidize Minnesota's energy goals. Here to explain the conflict and where to go from here is University of Minnesota Law Professor James Coleman. Thanks for your time this afternoon, Professor.

JAMES COLEMAN: Thanks. Great to be talking with you.

NINA MOINI: First, I wonder if people may not even how connected our energy grid is with other states. Can you tell us a little bit about the regional energy grid that Minnesota is a part of and that interdependence?

JAMES COLEMAN: Yeah. So there's a North American power grid, which is often called the biggest machine in the world. It's over several trillion dollars of investment. And it connects all of North America together.

But in particular, there's an eastern interconnection that covers from the East Coast into Canada and all the way out to the Great Plains. And so Minnesota sits almost at the center of that grid.

NINA MOINI: OK. So there's this complaint to the federal government led by North Dakota about updating the regional power grid. Can you explain what these updates are?

JAMES COLEMAN: Yeah. So this is part of a process that's been ongoing for a long period of time of building out the power lines that are needed to connect new sources of power with the grid and share power across the Midwest. And so those new power lines, in particular, are necessary for new solar and wind facilities that are connecting to the grid to help meet some of the goals that have been set in states like Minnesota for more renewable power.

NINA MOINI: OK. And it sounds like North Dakota, then, is concerned saying, well, those are your goals, not our goals. Tell us a little bit more about the concerns there.

JAMES COLEMAN: Yeah. That's right. So the MISO, which is the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, who manages the power grid, when they try to make projections about what kind of power lines are needed, of course, they have to consider what kind of goals all of the states within that system use.

And so there's obviously a disagreement about whether Minnesota's goals are important to spend money on meeting between states like Minnesota and states like North Dakota. And that's really at the crux of this dispute.

NINA MOINI: And I understand there are also other states, Louisiana, Mississippi, Montana, Arkansas, that are also backing North Dakota on this complaint. What do states that are farther away from Minnesota stand to gain or lose from these updates?

JAMES COLEMAN: Yeah. North Dakota is most centrally concerned. But for those other states, there's a concern about the precedent, obviously, because there might be those differences between how states like Minnesota treat questions like how much renewable energy we have on the grid and states like all of the rest of those, Montana, Louisiana, Arkansas, et cetera.

But in terms of the states that are really going to see higher bills because of this investment in power lines that are necessary to meet Minnesota standards, North Dakota is really at the center of that dispute.

NINA MOINI: So North Dakota is arguing states with these ambitious decarbonization targets, like Minnesota, should be the ones to pay for the infrastructure needed. How have these costs historically been spread across states? Does this come up all the time?

JAMES COLEMAN: Well, it does, but for these Midwestern states, we've seen fewer disputes than we've seen in some other parts of the country. So it's very common to have disputes about who should pay for shared power infrastructure, for shared investments in the power grid.

In the Midwest, in some ways, maybe it's surprising that we haven't had more disputes sooner, given the diverging tracks that you've seen in terms of climate and renewable policy. So perhaps it's not a surprise. Perhaps it's only a surprise that we haven't had this dispute earlier.

But in the past, we've seen that states have mostly been able to come together with a shared vision of how many power lines and where power lines need to be built. Here we're seeing that shared vision break down.

NINA MOINI: Can you remind us just what Minnesota's energy goals are right now and just how the regional power grid fits in?

JAMES COLEMAN: Minnesota has very aggressive goals to rapidly transition to mostly renewable power. And one of the challenges there is that Minnesota historically has been more dependent on coal and now is increasingly dependent on natural gas for electricity.

And so if it's going to meet its renewable goals, it's going to have to get a lot of power from places where wind is more abundant, where sun is more abundant, and there's maybe less population.

So you're talking about importing a lot of power from those Western states, as well as to some extent, Iowa, et cetera. And so the power grid is really crucial to helping Minnesota meet the goals that it set for the percentage of renewables on the grid.

NINA MOINI: How do conflicts like this, if they arise, play out in other parts of the country, I wonder. Is this an issue on the West Coast and East Coast? I mean, you think about New York or California and how those states would fit in with their surroundings. How does that go over usually?

JAMES COLEMAN: Yeah, absolutely. This has been a fight across the country. And it's important to understand that it is often for different reasons. So it's not always about disagreements and renewable penetration on the grid.

So if you look at Minnesota versus North Dakota, that's one of the bigger contrasts you get between neighboring states in terms of some of their goals for addressing climate change and moving away from fossil fuels.

And so I think it's not that surprising that we have a dispute here. But there have long been disputes that are more just about financial burden sharing. We've seen a number of disputes in PJM, the neighboring independent system operator that we have, which basically, there's been fights-- East Coast or Midwestern states should pay more for the power lines that are built.

And we've often seen those reach federal courts. And sometimes, the decisions of the independent system operator have been overturned by the federal courts. And so these are long-running disputes that we've seen. So in some ways, it's not surprising. Maybe it's just surprising we haven't seen as many fights yet.

NINA MOINI: And what do you think about just the future of disputes like this? Minnesota broke ground on part of this project, I understand, in Becker earlier this month. I wonder, as time moves on, if states start to set more ambitious goals, what that would look like.

JAMES COLEMAN: Yeah, this is undoubtedly a big problem. I mean, when you look at what MISO did, in this case, the grid manager for the Midwest, in part, it was relying not just on those state standards, but to a certain extent on federal goals for decarbonization.

And of course, in the interim, a lot of those federal goals and federal incentives have started to be rolled back. And so the less federal policy we get on increasing renewables, et cetera, the more those differences from state to state become salient, because they're not operating against a backdrop that's moving everybody toward more renewable energy.

And so I expect that we'll see a lot more of these going forward in the absence of some kind of federal plan that gets every state on the same track.

NINA MOINI: All right, James. Thanks so much for stopping by Minnesota Now and breaking all this down for us. Thank you.

JAMES COLEMAN: Thank you.

NINA MOINI: That was James Coleman, a professor focused on energy law at the University of Minnesota Law School.

For storage, the country needs rapid expansion in both pumped-storage hydropower (PSP) and battery energy storage systems (BESS), which appears feasible.
The analysis shows that in FY 2031-32, the power system will need coal plants far less than in FY 2024-25 during the day.
Doing so will not only align with NEP-2032 objectives but also ensure a more economically efficient, resilient, and sustainable power system.
If renewable energy and storage targets are delivered, the existing coal pipeline is sufficient for reliability and peak coverage.","India’s power system is entering a new phase of transition. As renewables and storage gain a bigger share of the country’s generation mix, coal’s role is changing to a flexible balancing resource from being a baseload provider. Its new role makes coal-based power costlier while firm and dispatchable renewable options become more cost-competitive. In such a scenario, building coal capacity beyond the existing targets of the National Electricity Plan (NEP) 2032 targets is no longer economical for the country.

India is broadly on track to meet the NEP-2032 generation-mix targets for solar, coal and hydro. Wind targets require higher annual growth rates. For storage, the country needs rapid expansion in both pumped-storage hydropower (PSP) and battery energy storage systems (BESS), which appears feasible. The only technology likely to miss the target is nuclear.

As the generation mix changes, coal is likely to go from being the pillar of the power system and its baseload provider to a flexible balancing resource that supports growing variable renewable energy. This change has profound implications for its cost-competitiveness. By the fiscal year (FY) 2031-32, our analysis finds that coal-based electricity will be roughly 25% costlier than FY 2024-25.

Using a chronological, least-cost operations model of the Indian power sector (PyPSA-India), we compare how the coal fleet operates today (FY 2024–25) versus FY 2031-32, under the NEP scenario. The analysis shows that in FY 2031-32, the power system will need coal plants far less than in FY 2024-25 during the day. The higher solar in the system will mean coal plants will need to operate closer to their minimum technical limits. The fleet will routinely swing by 70–80 gigawatts (GW) between morning and midday, operating with only ~7 GW of headroom above its technical minimum.

This increasing flexibility requirement is what will keep making coal-based electricity costlier. As Plant Load Factors (PLFs) fall to around 55%, fixed costs will spread over fewer units of generation, driving up the effective cost of coal power. Additional part-load inefficiencies, higher auxiliary consumption, and retrofit needs will further raise generation costs — together leading to the aforementioned 25% rise in the effective tariff of coal-based electricity.

By contrast, firm and dispatchable renewable energy (FDRE) options — renewable energy coupled with battery storage — are becoming increasingly competitive, with tariffs between INR 4.3–5.8/kilowatt-hour (kWh) and proven ability to meet availability and performance obligations. India can now achieve reliability and flexibility without resorting to new coal builds.

India’s next phase of power sector planning should focus on enhancing system flexibility through storage, operational reforms, and selective retrofits, rather than expanding coal capacity. Doing so will not only align with NEP-2032 objectives but also ensure a more economically efficient, resilient, and sustainable power system.

No new coal beyond current pipeline needed if renewable targets are met

India can meet its 2032 power needs without adding coal beyond the ~35 GW already under construction. If renewable energy and storage targets are delivered, the existing coal pipeline is sufficient for reliability and peak coverage. Results indicate that ~10% of additional coal units would be entirely unutilised by FY 2031–32, while ~25% of the fleet would be heavily under-utilised—further evidence that new coal beyond the current pipeline is neither necessary nor economical.

Renewables with storage are emerging as more cost-effective options

New coal plants in India are increasingly uneconomic, with tariffs nearing INR 6/kWh (USD 68/MWh)—higher than that of Firm and Dispatchable Renewable Energy at INR 4.3–5.8/kWh (USD 49–67/MWh) and solar-plus-storage at INR 2.9–3.6/kWh (USD 33–41/MWh). With falling utilisation pushing costs higher, thermal power is no longer even close to the least-cost option for dispatchable power.",https://ember-energy.org/app/uploads/2025/10/hambach-open-pit-lignite-mine-solar-panels-niederzier-aerial-hero.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-10-28 21:03:46.001832

The outlook for Q4 and beyond- Crude oil approaches a critical technical level Crude oil is the leading energy commodity that continues to power the world.
U.S. energy policy, OPEC+ production increases, seasonality, and the potential for a more peaceful Middle East favor lower crude oil prices in Q4.
Oil products, coal, and ethanol are likely to follow crude oil prices over the coming weeks and months.
U.S. natural gas prices for January 2026 delivery were already trading near $4.30 per MMBtu on October 20.","I concluded my Q2 Barchart report on the energy sector with the following:

While the situation in the Middle East has calmed since the ceasefire between Israel/the U.S. and Iran, the region remains a tinderbox. Any hostilities over the coming weeks and months could cause sudden rallies in the crude oil, oil product, and natural gas futures markets due to supply concerns. As China is a leading consumer of crude oil, improvements in China’s economy could boost demand, supporting prices.

Meanwhile, OPEC+ has increased petroleum output, and the U.S. energy policy now favors a “drill-baby-drill” and “frack-baby-frack” approach to oil and gas. Increasing U.S. and OPEC+ output could put downward pressure on prices. The bottom line is that petroleum and product prices could be highly volatile over the second half of 2025. Coal and ethanol prices will likely follow oil and oil product price trends.

Natural gas is a seasonal energy commodity that tends to peak as winter approaches. Seasonality could support higher natural gas prices in late third quarter and fourth quarter of 2025.

Expect continued volatility in the energy sector, and you will not be disappointed.

While heating oil futures and distillate crack spreads, and ethanol swaps posted gains in Q3, the other energy commodities declined in Q3, and the bearish price action continues in late October 2025.

Crude oil continues to decline

Nearby NYMEX WTI crude oil futures fell 4.21% in Q3 and were 13.04% lower over the first nine months of 2025.

The monthly chart highlights the bearish trend that sent the WTI futures to settle at $62.37 per barrel on September 30, 2025. The NYMEX futures have continued to reach lower lows in Q4, falling to $55.96 per barrel on October 20, just above the April 2025 low of $55.12, the critical technical support level. After recovering, crude oil futures were just below the $62 per barrel level on October 27.

Nearby ICE Brent crude oil futures fell 0.90% in Q3 and were 10.02% lower over the first nine months of 2025.

The monthly chart highlights the bearish trend that sent the Brent futures to settle at $67.16 per barrel on September 30, 2025. The Brent futures have continued to reach lower lows in Q4, falling to $60.07 per barrel on October 20, just above the April 2025 low of $58.39, the critical technical support level. The Brent futures recovered and were above $66 per barrel on October 2. 7

WTI and Brent crude oil futures have been trending lower since the highs from 2022, and the bearish path of least resistance continues in Q4 2025.

Oil products reflect seasonality

Gasoline is a seasonal oil product that tends to rally during the driving season in spring and summer when demand increases, and trends lower during fall and winter when divers put fewer miles on their odometers.

Nearby NYMEX gasoline futures fell 4.79% in Q3 and were 1.81% lower over the first nine months of 2025.

The monthly chart highlights the bearish trend that sent the gasoline futures to settle at $1.9729 per gallon wholesale on September 30, 2025. The gasoline futures have continued to reach lower lows in Q4, falling to $1.7407 per barrel on October 17, the lowest price since February 2021, before recovering.

Despite its use for heating during winter, heating oil is less of a seasonal oil product as it is a proxy for other distillates, including diesel and jet fuels. Nearby NYMEX heating oil futures rose 2.47% in Q3 and were 0.70% higher over the first nine months of 2025.

The monthly chart highlights the bearish trend that sent the heating oil futures to settle at $2.3325 per gallon wholesale on September 30, 2025. The heating oil futures have continued to reach lower lows in Q4, falling to $2.1011 per gallon on October 17, above the April 2025 low of $1.8925 per gallon, the critical technical support level. Heating oil futures recovered by the end of October.

Crack spreads reflect the refining margin for processing crude oil into gasoline and distillate products. The gasoline crack spread declined in Q3, while the distillate crack spread rose during the three-month period. However, both gasoline and distillate refining margins were considerably higher over the first nine months of 2025. The gasoline refining margin was slightly lower than the Q3 closing level as of October 27, while the distillate crack spread was higher than the September 30, 2025, closing level.

Natural gas declines, despite seasonality

U.S. natural gas futures for delivery at the Henry Hub in Erath, Louisiana, tend to reach annual highs as the winter approaches. However, as of the end of Q3 2025, seasonality had not yet impacted prices. Nearby NYMEX natural gas futures fell 4.43% in Q3 and were 9.08% lower over the first nine months of 2025.

The monthly chart highlights the mostly sideways trend that caused the NYMEX natural gas futures to settle at $3.303 per MMBtu on September 30, 2025. The natural gas futures are steady in Q4, trading around the $3.43 per MMBtu level on October 27, with the December futures just above $4 as the peak demand and inventory withdrawal season approaches.

As the chart highlights, as of the week ending on October 17, 2025, natural gas inventories across the United States at 3.808 trillion cubic feet were 0.9% above last year’s level, and 4.5% over the five-year average for mid-October. As the season where withdrawal from stockpiles approaches, natural gas stocks peaked at 3.972 trillion cubic feet at the end of the 2024 injection season. Time will tell if stocks reach that level over the coming weeks before they begin declining.

As the war in Ukraine continues, Western European countries that typically depend on Russian natural gas supplies could increase their purchases of U.S. liquified natural gas, which is an increasing demand vertical for the energy commodity. However, the temperatures across the U.S. and Europe over the 2025/2026 winter will determine demand and if prices appreciate over the coming months.

Ethanol and coal prices move in opposite directions

Nearby Chicago ethanol swap prices rose 10.71% in Q3 and were 10.06% higher over the first nine months of 2025. The leading U.S. biofuel were around the $1.86 per gallon wholesale level at the end of September, and were lower with gasoline prices in October. The U.S. ethanol mandate increases the correlation between biofuel and gasoline prices. However, since U.S. ethanol is a corn product, lower corn prices, which dropped 1.19% in Q3 and 9.38%, likely prevented further price gains. The higher ethanol prices increased processing margins for refineries that process corn into biofuel. Meanwhile, Chicago ethanol swaps for November delivery were lower than the Q3 closing price, at the $1.7750 per gallon wholesale level, on October 27.

Nearby coal futures for delivery in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, moved 11.37% lower in Q3, settling at $95.50 per metric ton on September 30, 2025. The coal futures were 15.60% lower over the first three quarters of 2025. Nearby Rotterdam coal futures were virtually unchanged on October 27. Coal demand tends to increase during the winter heating season. China and India continue to burn coal for energy. Coal futures for delivery in Newcastle, Australia, declined 2.34% in Q3 and were 13.33% lower over the first nine months of 2025. The Australian coal futures were slightly lower than the Q3 closing level on October 27, 2025, at just below $108 per metric ton.

The outlook for Q4 and beyond- Crude oil approaches a critical technical level

Crude oil is the leading energy commodity that continues to power the world. U.S. energy policy, OPEC+ production increases, seasonality, and the potential for a more peaceful Middle East favor lower crude oil prices in Q4. A move below the $55.12 critical technical support on the continuous NYMEX crude oil futures contract could ignite substantial technical selling, leading to a test of the $50 per barrel level, or lower. Oil products, coal, and ethanol are likely to follow crude oil prices over the coming weeks and months.

Natural gas is heading into the peak demand season, when uncertainty about the weather will peak as inventories begin to decline in late November. Therefore, nearly U.S. natural gas prices could recover to the $4 per MMBtu level, or higher, over the coming weeks and months. U.S. natural gas prices for January 2026 delivery were already trading near $4.30 per MMBtu on October 20.

Expect lots of volatility in energy commodities over the coming days and weeks. In late October, I remain bearish on crude oil and bullish on natural gas for the coming weeks and until the end of 2025.",https://media.barchart.com/contributors-admin/common-images/images/Energy/Oil/The%20index%20of%20oil%20up%20by%20Pashalgnatov%20via%20istock.jpg,N,,2025-10-28 21:04:21.093812

On the Snake River, however, roughly 140 miles of salmon habitat are blocked by four dams. Experts point to this area as one of the main reasons Chinook salmon populations are at a fraction of their historic numbers and restoring these runs would have immediate downstream effects on starving Southern Resident orcas that rely on Chinook salmon as a primary food source.

To build visibility for this issue, we organized the “Run for Salmon Runs“. This seven-day week of movement and action aimed to involve people in our campaign to spotlight the plight of orcas and salmon, and to call for the removal of the Lower Snake River Dams.

Participants pledged to traverse 14 miles of the course of the week, representing one-tenth the distance of river impacted by the dams. Our Oceans Advocate, Ian Giancarlo, also organized seven community runs across Portland in and effort to run 140 miles, representing the full distance of impacted river, and to bring people together.

Now that the week is over, the final numbers are in: dozens of people took action to advocate for orcas and salmon, collectively traversed over 700 miles – the equivalent of running from Portland to Yosemite National Park – and had some fun along the way.

Here are just a few photo highlights from a successful week of advocacy and movement:

However with the “Run for Salmon Runs” crossing the finish line, our work doesn’t stop now. To truly safeguard the fate of Southern Resident orcas and the salmon they rely on, the Lower Snake River dams will need to come down, soon. There’s only 75 Southern Resident orcas left and experts suggest we’re witnessing a “bright extinction“: where an animal is visibly disappearing right in front us and we have solutions to address it.

That’s why we’re continuing to call on our state leaders to support the removal of these dams, which will have positive downstream effects on salmon and the orcas that need them.

""Lithium goes into everything from electric vehicles to large-scale battery electric storage to personal devices,"" said Kristen Ghattas, Chevron vice president of Carbon Capture and Storage & Lithium.

The primary focus is on southern Arkansas, where some of the nation’s richest lithium brine reserves are found.

According to state leaders, that resource could turn Arkansas into a hub for production, investment, and innovation.

""It's a great developing industry, kind of early days of the development, and it's an important natural resource that Arkansas has that can be developed to support the electrification trend and value chain here in the United States,"" said Ghattas.

Governor Sarah Sanders helped open the event, and said the state is building a homegrown lithium industry to reduce reliance on foreign supply chains.

""[We're] on the verge of production at several major sites, investing in further growth through smart state-level tax credits, ready to be a leader not just in lithium extraction, but in upstream and midstream manufacturing as well,"" said Sanders.

The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) on Oct. 24 issued an emergency order permitting PJM Interconnection LLC and Talen Energy Corp. to continue running an oil-fired power plant in Maryland to meet anticipated electricity demand through the end of the year.

Specifically, the order allows the plant at the H.A. Wagner Generating Station located in Anne Arundel County, Md., near Baltimore, to operate beyond an annual limit designed to reduce pollution, according to the DOE. The order went into effect Sunday and continues until Dec. 31.

“To ensure 65 million Americans in 13 states and D.C. do not experience blackouts in the coming winter months, I am issuing an emergency order for PJM Interconnection,” DOE Secretary Chris Wright said in a statement. “Americans deserve reliable power regardless of whether the wind is blowing or the sun is shining and especially during a cold snap.”

As outlined in the North American Electric Reliability Corporation’s Winter Reliability Assessment, PJM’s service area faces “risks of electricity supply shortfalls during periods of more extreme conditions” this winter.

Wright on July 28 granted PJM’s request to allow for the dispatch and operation of unit 4 at the Wagner Generating Station in excess of its operating limit through Oct. 26.

The “growing resource adequacy concern” that PJM cited in its July request still exists today, according to the DOE, which said PJM anticipates a continued need to schedule unit 4 in the final months of the year.

PJM has previously voiced concerns about resource adequacy.

For example, in a December 2024 statement filed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, PJM stated that its preliminary analysis shows “substantial increases” in load additions and that “its resource adequacy concerns are increasing at an extraordinary pace.”

And during a March hearing before the U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee, PJM President and CEO Manu Asthana testified that there is a “growing resource adequacy concern … impacting a significant part of our country.”",https://dailyenergyinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/shutterstock_2680737721.jpg,N,,2025-10-29 06:58:54.999016

A letter sent by the Raved to Regev, which was seen by ""Globes,"" says the car importers are planning to fight the tax increase.

In his letter, Raved reminded Regev of her visit to Tesla’s factory near Berlin, and writes, ""Since then, we have been in close professional contact with officials at the Ministry of Transport and are succeeding in promoting a beneficial policy that positions Israel with the rest of the Western world in everything related to the transition to advanced, environmentally friendly electric vehicles.""

He notes that since 2022, purchase tax on these vehicles has increased from 10% to 45%, and that as a result, there has been a significant decline in purchases of electric vehicles. Raved adds, ""These days, about two months before the end of 2025, it is still unknown what the purchase tax rate on electric vehicles will be for 2026 and beyond. If the government does not take any active steps, the purchase tax will jump on January 1, 2026 to a rate of 83% , and this is in clear contradiction to the public interest in promoting the green revolution and the commitments of the State of Israel.""

""The market is unable to cope""

He also mentions that in a discussion in the Knesset Finance Committee last June, a representative of the ministry demanded that the tax should not be increased until at least 2028, but the demand was not agreed to by the Ministry of Finance. ""The market is unable to cope with another price increase, for the fourth year in a row, and this is only a year after the tax jumped 10%,"" he writes.

In June, the Finance Committee decided that the benefit in the law for purchasing electric vehicles would be extended until the end of this year, at which time the purchase tax was already supposed to rise to 83%. The move to bring tax on electric vehicles in line with combustion engine cars was part of a larger package formulated by the Ministry of Finance, which was intended to cool the purchase of private vehicles - and a $0.15 per kilometer tax was also supposed to be imposed on electric vehicles, to make it less worthwhile to buy and drive these vehicles, which are much cheaper than public transport.

If the kilometrage tax had come into effect, journeys in an electric vehicle would still be cheaper than a fuel-powered vehicle, but the gap would have narrowed. Professionals have argued over the years that the tax breaks and the cost of using an electric vehicle discourage a shift to public transport. Although these cars pollute less, the dependence that the benefits maintain on the use of private vehicles has widespread economic consequences in terms of road accidents and loss of time and damage to productivity as a result of traffic congestion. It has also been argued that this is a revolution that is not essentially as ""green"" as car manufacturers and importers boast, because it perpetuates the existing situation in which Israeli roads are among the most congested of OECD countries.

Heinrich and Sheehy launched the bipartisan Senate Stewardship Caucus at a celebratory reception hosted by Nature is Nonpartisan.

Additional inaugural members of the Senate Stewardship Caucus include U.S. Senators Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), John Hickenlooper (D-Colo.), Steve Daines (R-Mont.), Chris Coons (D-Del.), and Katie Britt (R-Ala.).

“I can’t think of a better day to launch the bipartisan Senate Stewardship Caucus than on Teddy Roosevelt’s birthday. It’s also the day that a book called the Sand County Almanac was published in 1949. As a young person, I had the privilege of serving as an outfitter guide in the very landscapes that Aldo Leopold wrote of in that book. It was seminal in creating what he called a ‘Land Ethic’ — the relationship that our communities have with place, with land — public and private — with streams, with wildlife,” said Heinrich. “Putting together this Stewardship Caucus is an opportunity for all of us to work on these issues together to protect and conserve the places we know and love for this generation and the next.”

“Being stewards of our public lands is a big undertaking; it’s complex, it requires input from all stakeholders, and it demands a lot of patience. In Nevada, we know this better than anyone,” said Cortez Masto. “That’s why it’s so critical that we’re coming together to form this Stewardship Caucus. Because it takes all of us working together to protect our public lands and prepare for the future.”

“North Carolina has a long, proud history of conservation efforts to protect the natural beautiful across our state,” said Tillis. “I am proud to join the Senate Stewardship Caucus and ensure our public lands are protected for generations to come.”

""Our public lands make Colorado what it is,"" said Hickenlooper. ""We will protect our landscapes and preserve our American treasures for future generations to enjoy, working with anyone who stands with us.""

""I'm grateful to be part of founding the bipartisan Senate Stewardship Caucus and represent Alabama the Beautiful. Our great state is not only a destination for countless sportsmen, hunters, anglers, and nature-goers, but also the proud home to hardworking famers and foresters who work diligently to feed and clothe our state, nation, and world. It's our job as legislators to work toward responsible conservation solutions, and I'm looking forward to continuing that work as a part of this caucus to do just that,"" said Britt.

“Even when America feels more divided than ever, conservation is a place of consensus,” said Benji Backer, Founder & CEO of Nature Is Nonpartisan. “The most durable solutions come from bipartisanship, and we look forward to supporting the important work of the Senate Stewardship Caucus.”

Brookfield Asset Management also inched higher, rising 2.2% with a market capitalization of $91.2 billion.
The anticipated demand has created a nationwide rush to build new infrastructure, with nuclear reactors being at the forefront of this energy revolution.
Currently, there are six AP1000 reactors setting operational performance and availability records worldwide with 14 additional reactors under construction and five more under contract, they added.
To date, the AP1000 technology has been selected for nuclear energy programs in Poland, Ukraine and Bulgaria.","Cameco (TSX: CCO) (NYSE: CCJ) surged on Tuesday after the US government announced a strategic partnership with Westinghouse Electric Company, which it co-owns with Brookfield Asset Management, to accelerate the development of America’s nuclear power.

Washington envisions that at least $80 billion of new nuclear reactors will be constructed across the country, using Westinghouse nuclear reactor technology. Once constructed, the reactors are expected to generate reliable and secure power, including for significant data center and compute capacity that will drive America’s growth in artificial intelligence.

The move, the companies say, aligns with US President Donald Trump’s executive order signed in May aimed at advancing the nation’s nuclear technology development, which he sees as vital to its energy security and AI ambitions.

Cameco’s US-listed shares jumped more than 20% to an all-time high of $104.75 apiece on the news, taking the Canadian uranium producer’s market capitalization to $45.3 billion. Brookfield Asset Management also inched higher, rising 2.2% with a market capitalization of $91.2 billion.

Nuclear renaissance

BloombergNEF estimates that power consumption from US data centers is expected to double by 2035, reaching almost 9% of total demand. The anticipated demand has created a nationwide rush to build new infrastructure, with nuclear reactors being at the forefront of this energy revolution.

Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick said the $80 billion pact with Westinghouse “embodies the bold vision of President Trump – to rebuild our energy sovereignty, create high-paying jobs and drive America to the forefront of the nuclear renaissance.”

“Our administration is focused on ensuring the rapid development, deployment and use of advanced nuclear technologies,” he stressed.

The agreement comes against the backdrop of a sluggish nuclear buildout in the US — only three reactors have been completed this century.

AP1000 reactors

Under the partnership, Westinghouse will deploy its AP1000 reactor, which it hails as the most advanced commercially available, with fully passive safety systems, modular construction design and the smallest footprint per MWe on the market.

Each two-unit AP1000 site would create or sustain 45,000 manufacturing and engineering jobs in 43 states, and a national deployment will create more than 100,000 construction jobs, the companies said.

Currently, there are six AP1000 reactors setting operational performance and availability records worldwide with 14 additional reactors under construction and five more under contract, they added. To date, the AP1000 technology has been selected for nuclear energy programs in Poland, Ukraine and Bulgaria.

BMO Capital Markets, in a note, said the $80 billion investment could support 6-10 new AP1000s (depending on costs), “which could add significantly to Westinghouse’s project pipeline through the 2030s.”

“This partnership with the US government will help unlock the potential that Westinghouse and nuclear energy can play to accelerate the growth of artificial intelligence in the United States, while meeting growing electricity demand and energy security needs at scale,” Connor Teskey, president of Brookfield Asset Management, stated in a press release.

“We expect this new partnership to support the global growth opportunities for both Westinghouse’s and Cameco’s nuclear products, services and technologies, adding significant long-term value for our stakeholders and enhancing energy, national and climate security around the world,” added Cameco CEO Tim Gitzel.

Cameco and Brookfield formed a strategic partnership to acquire Westinghouse in October 2022. The partnership brought together Cameco’s expertise in the nuclear industry with Brookfield’s recognized position as one of the world’s largest investors in energy generation technologies.",https://www.mining.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Ap1000-1024x577.jpg,N,,2025-10-28 20:03:15.704431

South Dakota’s agricultural producers and sporting tradition cannot afford more empty promises.","Political gridlock in Washington has shut down the government and left South Dakota’s farmers, ranchers and conservationists stranded. Too many in Washington are ignoring the urgent need for a Farm Bill that improves and funds U.S. Department of Agriculture conservation programs, like the Conservation Reserve Program.

Everyone saw the government shut its doors at midnight on Oct. 1, but few realize the Farm Bill expired at the same moment, halting the vital programs it supports.

This bureaucratic paralysis now threatens more than 2.6 million acres enrolled in CRP across South Dakota, impacting over 14,000 farms and ranches and jeopardizing $145 million in conservation payments annually. With CRP unable to enroll new acres or pay landowners, rural livelihoods and our state’s hunting economy hang in the balance. Every fall, hunters drive $680 million into South Dakota’s economy, an investment built on strong partnerships between private landowners and USDA programs.

What the government shutdown means for agriculture agencies

Yes, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act boosted long-term USDA funding, and leaders like Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-South Dakota, deserve thanks for advancing conservation. But these gains mean nothing if Congress fails to act now. This shutdown only compounds what was already a tough year for agriculture: Corn prices have dropped to their lowest level since 2020, and farmers face mounting uncertainty with every day of delay.

Farmers and ranchers need a resolution to the shutdown and a Farm Bill that strengthens voluntary conservation, maintains local input on conservation decisions and rewards stewardship. They also need reinstated contract payments to prevent further economic damage.

Washington could prioritize farmers, ranchers and the future of conservation by:

Reinstating mandatory CRP and conservation program payments.

Passing a Farm Bill that funds and improves voluntary, incentive-based conservation programs.

Ensuring CRP is reauthorized, expanded and enhanced for the benefit of wildlife, rural communities, and agricultural producers statewide.

In the first edition of that report in 2007, Ohio’s economic outlook ranked a dismal 47th out of the 50 states.
The persistence of many burdensome local income taxes in Ohio blunts some of the impact of the state’s reforms.
Nine such states without a personal income tax exist today, and more — like Kentucky, Mississippi, and Oklahoma — are moving in that direction under current law.
Meanwhile, entrepreneurs and investors already view Ohio’s policy climate as increasingly predictable, with incredible opportunities for growth in the years ahead.","Earlier this year, Ohio joined the growing number of states that have adopted a flat tax on personal income — a quiet revolution in tax policy that is reshaping the economic landscape of the nation. Since 2021, eight states have moved away from progressive income taxes toward flat-rate systems.

This shift reflects a simple but powerful idea: prosperity is created by those who work, invest, and produce — not by those who redistribute.

For Ohio, this marks an important moment. Once an industrial powerhouse, the state had suffered for decades from losing population, businesses, and influence. Since 1980, Ohio has lost nine congressional seats due to population declines — more than any state except New York and Pennsylvania. Between 1981 and 2022, every single year saw more Americans leaving Ohio than arriving.

Economic policies have consequences, and Ohio’s policies for much of the last half-century made it less attractive to those seeking opportunity. The Rich States, Poor States: ALEC-Laffer State Economic Competitiveness Index quantifies what many Ohioans have long felt. In the first edition of that report in 2007, Ohio’s economic outlook ranked a dismal 47th out of the 50 states.

Low economic freedom, high taxes, and burdensome regulations are not just abstract ideas — they are measurable barriers to economic growth and well-being. The contrast with Ohio’s neighbor to the west was very telling. While Ohio stagnated, Indiana pursued steady, incremental reforms — cutting taxes, controlling spending, and becoming a right-to-work state — while maintaining a predictable business climate. As a result, Indiana now ranks third best in the nation for economic outlook.

Policies, not luck or geography, explain the difference. But thankfully for Ohio taxpayers, their lawmakers have taken note, and their recent policy reforms suggest a willingness to learn from success rather than repeat failure.

Since 2005, Ohio’s top personal income tax rate has been reduced from 7.2% to 3.1%, and in 2026 the new 2.75% flat tax will take effect. That’s lower than neighboring Indiana’s rate and among the lowest of any state that still taxes income. That matters — it matters a lot. When people and businesses can keep more of what they earn, they make different choices about where to live, invest, and hire.

Indeed, 2023 marked a turning point for Ohio. For the first time since 1981, Ohio recorded a net in-migration of residents. The improvement is visible in the data: Ohio’s ranking in Rich States, Poor States has climbed from 47th in 2008 to 25th today.

The persistence of many burdensome local income taxes in Ohio blunts some of the impact of the state’s reforms. Tax reform is always a work in progress everywhere. However, the pattern is clear — the states gaining the most new residents across America are those that impose no personal income tax or generally have competitive tax burdens. Nine such states without a personal income tax exist today, and more — like Kentucky, Mississippi, and Oklahoma — are moving in that direction under current law.

Ohio’s recent tax reforms show incredible movement in the right direction. But the Buckeye State’s improvement isn’t limited to economic policy. The expansion of a genuine school choice system in Ohio signals a deeper transformation in how the state views opportunity and human capital with the expansion of the EdChoice school choice program.

When tax cuts allow residents to retain more of what they earn, and when educational choice allows families to use those earnings to invest in the educational opportunities that will bear the best returns for their children — those potent engines for upward mobility begin to run in tandem.

Lower income taxes reduce the state’s drag on economic initiative and work, and broader school choice reduces one of the great barriers to human capital development and upward mobility. In combination, these policies improve Ohio’s ability to attract and retain both human and investment capital.

A talented worker who sees more take-home pay and viable, high-quality schooling options for their children has less reason to leave — and more reason to stay. Meanwhile, entrepreneurs and investors already view Ohio’s policy climate as increasingly predictable, with incredible opportunities for growth in the years ahead.

The Ohio comeback story is still being written — but it is an incredible story, and they are just getting started. While Ohio was a state with an economic outlook in the bottom five nationally eighteen years ago, and had suffered from decades of out-migration, major policy accomplishments from Ohio lawmakers in recent years show that any state can make dramatic gains when you have the right leadership pursuing bold, principled, free-market ideas.",https://alec.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/JW-ARJ-Ohio-Final-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-28 19:04:07.358670

“With the ARAI certification of our 4680 Bharat Cell battery pack, we are ready to deliver our first vehicles powered by our own cells.
The integration of Bharat Cell with its EVs will lead to “a very sizable margin expansion”, he said.
Launched earlier this month, Ola Shakti will use the 4680 Bharat Cell battery technology platform produced at its Gigafactory in Tamil Nadu to provide energy solutions for homes, small businesses.
Shares of Ola Electric were trading 0.10% higher at INR 51.80 at 15:00 IST.","Months after launching its in-house lithium-ion battery, 4680 Bharat Cell, Ola Electric has secured a certification from the Automotive Research Association of India (ARAI) for the 5.2 kWh configuration variant of the battery cell pack.

In an exchange filing, the EV major said that it will start rolling out its vehicles powered by the cells. The 5.2 kWh battery pack is set to debut on the S1 Pro+ soon, making the escooter the first EV to be powered by the in-house developed cell technology.

Ola Electric’s Bharat Cell has secured the certification under the AIS-156 Amendment 4, which specifies detailed testing requirements for EVs and their rechargeable electrical energy storage systems (REESS), including protection against over-charging, thermal runaway, short circuits, water ingress (IPX7), and electrical safety.

The ARAI certification under AIS-156 Amendment 4, issued by the road transport and highways ministry in December 2023, ensures that the battery complies with the Indian safety norms and environmental standards for electric powertrains.

“With the ARAI certification of our 4680 Bharat Cell battery pack, we are ready to deliver our first vehicles powered by our own cells. This is a defining milestone in our mission to build India’s EV technology leadership and reduce reliance on global supply chains. Customers will soon be able to experience the enhanced range, performance and reliability that our homegrown cells bring to our scooters and motorcycles,” a company spokesperson said.

Ola Electric’s plans to integrate its in-house developed cells with its escooters have been in the making for over a year. During its flagship event Ola Sankalp 2025 in August, CEO and founder Bhavish Aggarwal said the company will start rolling out EVs with Bharat Cell integration by late-2025.

The certification marks a critical milestone for the company. The battery pack is an area where Ola Electric, like a number of other Indian EV OEMs, has been dependent on Chinese and Korean imports.

Earlier, the company had claimed that its lithium-ion cell packs have five times more energy (275 Wh/kg) than the 2170 form-factor cells which are currently being used extensively in automobile applications.

“This is expected to significantly enhance range, performance, improve unit economics, and reduce dependence on global supply chains, especially as its upcoming Gigafactory scales production,” the company said in the filing today.

Ola Electric has been actively doubling down on its cell manufacturing capabilities. Earlier this year, its board approved an additional infusion of INR 199 Cr in its battery manufacturing subsidiary Ola Cell Technologies (OCT) to support its business requirement.

Besides, it also realigned the utilisation of its IPO funds in October to expand the R&D expenditure to INR 1,505 Cr. Now, the company is also looking to raise an additional INR 1,500 Cr via issuance of securities.

Aggarwal stated earlier that the in-house developed battery pack integration is the “centrepiece” of Ola Electric’s roadmap to profitability. The integration of Bharat Cell with its EVs will lead to “a very sizable margin expansion”, he said.

In order to increase the capacity utilisation of its battery manufacturing plant, Ola Electric recently forayed into the residential battery energy storage system (BESS) segment with the launch of Ola Shakti. Launched earlier this month, Ola Shakti will use the 4680 Bharat Cell battery technology platform produced at its Gigafactory in Tamil Nadu to provide energy solutions for homes, small businesses.

This comes even as Ola Electric continues to face rising losses. While the company is yet to disclose its financial performance for Q2 FY26, it plunged deeper into the red in the previous quarter. The company’s consolidated net loss widened 23% YoY to INR 428 Cr in Q1 FY26, while its operating revenue declined about 50% YoY to INR 828 Cr.

The Duane Arnold Energy Center, located about eight miles northwest of Cedar Rapids, Iowa, was closed in 2020.
“Restarting Duane Arnold marks an important milestone for NextEra Energy,” said John Ketchum, chairman and CEO of NextEra Energy, in a written statement.
“Our partnership with Google not only brings nuclear energy back to Iowa — it also accelerates the development of next-generation nuclear technology,” Ketchum said.
The Duane Arnold facility is the third U.S. nuclear power to begin the process of restarting operations this year.","JUNO BEACH, Fla. — NextEra Energy, the world’s largest electric utility, has agreed to restart a shuttered nuclear power plant in Iowa to provide Google with energy it needs to drive its artificial intelligence data centers.

The Duane Arnold Energy Center, located about eight miles northwest of Cedar Rapids, Iowa, was closed in 2020.

As a result of the deal — which commits Google to buy electricity from the plant for the next 25 years — it could begin operating again in early 2029, pending regulatory approval.

“Once operational, Google will purchase power from the 615-MW plant as a 24/7 carbon-free energy source to help power Google’s growing cloud and AI infrastructure in Iowa, while also strengthening local grid reliability,” the companies said in a joint press release.

NextEra Energy has estimated that the cost of the restart will be in excess of $1.6 billion, but both companies emphasized they believe the benefits stemming from their partnership will also be huge.

Google previously announced that it plans to invest $7 billion in Iowa over the next two years in cloud and AI infrastructure, with the bulk of the money going toward the development of both a new data center in Cedar Rapids and expansion of its existing facility in Council Bluffs.

The company, which has been making related investments in the state since 2007, said a portion of that investment will also support the electrical training ALLIANCE in Iowa to help increase the number of Iowans joining the state’s electrical workforce.

As for the restart of the Duane Arnold Energy Center, NextEra and Google said the project will create more than 1,600 direct, indirect and inducted jobs during the construction phase and provide Iowa with more than $9 billion in projected economic benefits once the plant is operational.

In addition to Google’s agreement to purchase energy from the Duane Arnold plant, one of the facility’s current minority owners, Central Iowa Power Cooperative, has agreed to buy surplus electricity not needed by Google.

As part of that agreement, NextEra Energy will acquire CIPCO and Corn Belt Power Cooperative’s combined 30% interest in the plant, which will bring its ownership stake up to 100%.

“Restarting Duane Arnold marks an important milestone for NextEra Energy,” said John Ketchum, chairman and CEO of NextEra Energy, in a written statement.

“Our partnership with Google not only brings nuclear energy back to Iowa — it also accelerates the development of next-generation nuclear technology,” Ketchum said.

“Thanks to the leadership of the Trump administration, Google and NextEra Energy are answering the call of America’s golden age of power demand, creating thousands of jobs, strengthening Iowa’s economy, delivering long-term value to our shareholders and helping power America’s future through innovation and technology,” he added.

Ruth Porat, president and chief investment officer of Alphabet and Google, said the partnership “serves as a model for the investments needed across the country to build energy capacity and deliver reliable, clean power, while protecting affordability and creating jobs that will drive the AI-driven economy.”

The Duane Arnold Energy Center was shut down in 2020 because it was struggling to compete with natural gas and other renewable energy sources due to high operating costs, among other factors.

However, the surge in the development of AI data centers with their almost insatiable thirst for power, has sparked a revival of interest in the nuclear sector.

The Duane Arnold facility is the third U.S. nuclear power to begin the process of restarting operations this year.

Approximately 16 states, all where voters chose Democrat Kamala Harris in the 2024 U.S. presidential election, saw 223 clean energy projects. These projects amounted to nearly $7.6 billion in grants. The announcement came Oct. 2, the day after the government shutdown commenced, from the director of the U.S. Office of Management and Budget Russell Vought.

Vought said in an X (Twitter) post, “Nearly $8 billion in Green New Scam funding to fuel the Left’s climate agenda is being cancelled.” Of the 223 projects that were cancelled, 12 were in Connecticut for a total of $52.9 million. The eight companies that were affected included, among others, RTX Corporation with four projects, Karpman Consulting LLC with two, and Mott Corporation, which had the largest grant at $10 million for a water electrolysis efficiency project in Farmington.

Some of the other innovative projects cancelled included one that had hydrogen power gas turbines, software projects relating to building codes and storm forecasts, and electricity production from solid oxide fuel cells. FuelCell Energy, which oversees the electricity production from solid oxide fuel cells projects in Danbury, however, promised that their project is not in danger because it is nearly complete, according to spokesperson Kathleen Blomquist in a CT Mirror article.

All five of Connecticut’s congressional districts were hit by cancellations with the 1st Congressional District represented by John Larson seeing the most cancellations, with four out of 12 projects. In a press release, Larson demanded that U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright reinstate all the projects that had been defunded and accused the Trump administration of targeting political enemies.

“This funding was approved by Congress, and for many projects, work on the ground is already complete,” said Larson in the press release. “The Trump Administration doesn’t want to lower costs – they want to stoke division by punishing their political enemies, even at the expense of American innovation, global leadership, and millions of taxpayer dollars. Their top budget official even bragged on social media about canceling projects in blue states. Stop these childish games and reinstate these funds now.”

Rosa DeLauro, who represents Connecticut’s 3rd Congressional District, had a similar response and said, “Terminating critical energy projects in Democratic states weaponizes policy for political revenge and will only drive energy bills higher, increase unemployment, and eliminate jobs. It is reckless and betrays both common sense and public trust.”

Her district also had a project grant for Proton Energy Systems Inc. cancelled. Within the Senate, Connecticut’s Richard Blumenthal fired back in a letter written to Wright that said: “These projects were supporting lower energy prices, grid reliability, and American energy independence. Cancelling them – in a manner that is illogical, chaotic, and illegal – will only result in increased energy costs, less electricity reliability, and more pollution, hurting the American people.”",https://chargerbulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/cb_header.png,N,,2025-10-28 19:19:25.733521

Kevin Mullin (CA-15), a member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, are raising concerns about how increasing demands on the electrical grid could impact household energy bills. In letters to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Edison Electric Institute, and the Data Center Coalition, the lawmakers are requesting information and support to help ensure everyday Americans and small businesses aren’t bearing the brunt of data center energy costs.

Data centers are projected to account for up to 12% of total U.S. electricity use by 2028, up from 4% in 2023. While supportive of U.S. innovation and competitiveness, the lawmakers expressed concern that the costs associated with developing and powering data centers could undermine energy affordability nationwide. By advocating for more transparency from utilities and data center developers, regulators can better understand the impacts of data center development on energy costs and how to protect consumers.

“Our energy system is at a unique inflection point. With roughly half of the grid needing replacement and demand expected to grow dramatically, the U.S. faces both a challenge and an opportunity to meet America’s energy needs for the next century. The decisions made now will determine whether America can sustain the growth of critical infrastructure like data centers while keeping electricity reliable and affordable,” the lawmakers wrote.

Rep. Kevin Mullin (CA-15) authored the letter, which is co-signed by Reps. Kathy Castor (FL-14), Ranking Member of the Energy Subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Nanette Barragán (CA-44), Donald Beyer (VA-08), André Carson (IN-07), Madeline Dean (PA-04), Debbie Dingell (MI-06), Greg Landsman (OH-01), Mike Levin (CA-49), Robert Menendez (NJ-13), Kelly Morrison (MN-03), Seth Moulton (MA-06), Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (NY-14), Mike Quigley (IL-05), Delia Ramirez (IL-03), Andrea Salinas (OR-06), Janice Schakowsky (IL-09), Kim Schrier (WA-08), Adam Smith (WA-09), and Lori Trahan (MA-03).

Data centers play a vital role in advancing U.S. innovation, competitiveness, and security. However, we are concerned that energy costs associated with data center development and power consumption are increasingly being passed on to everyday Americans and small businesses, undermining energy affordability for consumers nationwide.

The growth of data centers represents a long-term challenge for the grid, with electricity demand that could account for 12% of total U.S. electricity use by 2028.[i] Large, hyperscale data centers—the kind currently being planned to support AI workloads—can consume between 20 and 100 MW, with some of the very largest facilities approaching 500 MW, roughly the electricity use of 375,000 homes or a small city.[ii] The expansion of data centers risks creating persistent affordability challenges for households and small businesses.

Costs associated with grid upgrades and energy generation needed to serve data centers are already being passed down to customers. A recent report found that, in 2024 alone, utilities in seven states whose grid operations are governed by PJM Interconnection passed more than $4.3 billion in transmission upgrade costs onto customers to bring data centers online.[iii] At the same time, the additional electricity demand from data centers drove up PJM’s generation costs by $7.3 billion, or 82%—costs that are ultimately passed on to consumers through their energy bills.[iv] These staggering figures underscore the urgent need to protect ratepayers, both in the region served by PJM and nationwide.

Another concern is that consumers and regulators often lack visibility into how rate increases are calculated or who ultimately pays. A recent report analyzed nearly 50 regulatory proceedings nationwide and found that contracts between utilities and data center developers are frequently confidential, preventing the public from having a full picture of electricity usage and costs.[v] For example, in recent filings with state public utility commissions, crucial information around data center anticipated energy demand, projected local benefits, and associated payment terms have often been redacted. While some confidentiality is necessary to protect business interests and promote competition, arrangements can make it difficult for consumers, regulators, and policymakers to assess whether the costs—which could ultimately be paid for by all utility customers—are fair or reasonable, highlighting the need for transparent reporting and accountability.

These proposals to finance grid upgrades to support data center expansion come at a time when electricity costs are already straining American families. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the average residential retail price of electricity is projected to increase 18% by 2026 compared to 2022.[vi] Families are feeling the squeeze: two in three Americans say utility bills are a source of financial stress, and three in four are worried about further increases.[vii] With budgets already stretched thin, any additional costs of powering new data centers would contribute to energy insecurity and financial hardship for millions of Americans.

As Congress considers how best to address this issue, we request your responses to the following questions:

How are you and your members working with utilities and tenants to ensure that the costs of new grid infrastructure associated with data centers are not passed through to households and small businesses?

What role could Congress play in ensuring fair cost allocation as data center development accelerates nationwide? Specifically, what approaches—such as minimum usage commitments, separate rate classes, or upfront cost recovery—could be considered to protect consumers?

What steps will you take to ensure transparency of contracts and tariffs involving large data centers, so that consumers can clearly understand the impacts on their electricity costs?

Do current data center load forecasts reflect realistic expectations for future demand? How are uncertainties in these forecasts being accounted for in grid and generation planning?

How can utilities, regulators, data centers and tenants better cooperate to incorporate demand flexibility and reduce or shift electricity use during peak times?

What technologies, tools, and/or research are you investing in to help utilities, grid operators, energy project developers, and the data center industry better plan and site both generation and demand-side load infrastructure?

Long term, what reforms could Congress consider to ensure that the grid is both resilient and flexible enough to integrate new sources of energy generation and meet rising demand?

Our energy system is at a unique inflection point. With roughly half of the grid needing replacement[viii] and demand expected to grow dramatically, the U.S. faces both a challenge and an opportunity to meet America’s energy needs for the next century. The decisions made now will determine whether America can sustain the growth of critical infrastructure like data centers while keeping electricity reliable and affordable.",https://beyer.house.gov/images/facebook-meta.jpg,N,,2025-10-28 18:04:51.662480

Tim Sheehy is the co-chair of a new bipartisan caucus launched this week focused on protecting the nation’s public lands.
The Senate Stewardship Caucus has six inaugural members and is co-chaired by New Mexico Democrat Sen. Martin Heinrich.
Public lands have been a flashpoint in federal politics this year as resolutions and budget riders have included proposed sales and exchanges of public lands.
Zinke, a former Secretary of the Interior during President Donald Trump’s first term, has positioned himself as a public lands champion.
“As a lifelong outdoorsman, I’m proud to join Senator Sheehy and Senator Heinrich in founding the Senate Stewardship Caucus, so that we can protect and manage our lands for generations to come.”","Montana’s junior Sen. Tim Sheehy is the co-chair of a new bipartisan caucus launched this week focused on protecting the nation’s public lands.

The Senate Stewardship Caucus has six inaugural members and is co-chaired by New Mexico Democrat Sen. Martin Heinrich. The caucus’ mission is to drive efforts to expand and protect access to public lands, “promote commonsense land management policies, and support economic growth in rural communities,” according to a news release from Sheehy’s office.

“Public lands are a purely American institution, and all Americans can find common ground in working together to better manage, conserve, and steward these treasured landscapes while driving economic growth and supporting our resource and agricultural economies,” Sheehy said in a statement. “I’m proud to launch the Senate Stewardship Caucus with Senator Heinrich to safeguard the rights of Americans to hunt, fish, and recreate on our public lands and ensure we protect them for generations to come.”

The formation of the Stewardship Caucus follows a similar move in the House where earlier this year Montana Rep. Ryan Zinke launched the Public Lands Caucus, which Montana Rep. Troy Downing is a member of. All four members of Montana’s federal delegation are Republicans.

Public lands have been a flashpoint in federal politics this year as resolutions and budget riders have included proposed sales and exchanges of public lands.

Zinke, a former Secretary of the Interior during President Donald Trump’s first term, has positioned himself as a public lands champion.

Sheehy drew on his professional work as CEO of Bridger Aerospace, a private aerial firefighting company, during his 2024 election against incumbent Democrat Sen. Jon Tester to tout his own land management bona fides. He also previously served on the board of the The Property and Environment Research Center, a self-described property rights and environmental organization and focuses on what it calls “free market environmentalism.”

The Stewardship Caucus launch event on Monday was hosted by Nature is Nonpartisan, a nonprofit organization that seeks environmental solutions that span the political rift.

“Even when America feels more divided than ever, conservation is a place of consensus,” Nature is Nonpartisan CEO Benji Backer said in a statement “The most durable solutions come from bipartisanship, and we look forward to supporting the important work of the Senate Stewardship Caucus.”

Caucus co-chairman Heinrich said in his remarks that the caucus came together on an important day — Teddy Roosevelt’s birthday, and the publication day of the Sand County Almanac, by Aldo Leopold, a giant in the annals of American conservation.

“As a young person, I had the privilege of serving as an outfitter guide in the very landscapes that Aldo Leopold wrote of in that book. It was seminal in creating what he called a ‘Land Ethic’ — the relationship that our communities have with place, with land — public and private — with streams, with wildlife,” Heinrich said. “Putting together this Stewardship Caucus is an opportunity for all of us to work on these issues together to protect and conserve the places we know and love for this generation and the next.”

The other inaugural members of the caucus include Montana’s senior Sen. Steve Daines, and Sens. Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nevada, Thom Tillis, R-North Caroline., John Hickenlooper, D-Colorado, Chris Coons, D-Delaware, and Katie Britt , R-Alabama.

“America is home to the most pristine natural beauty in the world, and it’s our job to be good stewards of the land we’re blessed to live in,” Daines said. “As a lifelong outdoorsman, I’m proud to join Senator Sheehy and Senator Heinrich in founding the Senate Stewardship Caucus, so that we can protect and manage our lands for generations to come.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-89/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/54886130601_6888724eb6_k-1024x6831761685445.jpg?h=199d8c1f&itok=eg17ElGG,N,,2025-10-28 18:19:14.332230

The accessories are designed for do-it-yourself installation, but Slate said its network of independent shops can also do that work.
“For electrical and battery-related repairs that only a pro should handle, select RepairPal shops will be trained in Slate-specific procedures and able to perform high-voltage service,” Slate said.
In states that require manufacturers or dealers to handle warranty repairs, Slate will offer alternatives, he said.","Electric vehicle startup Slate Auto will use a network of independent repair shops to handle service and accessory installations for its two-door pickup, which it plans to launch late next year, the company said Oct. 28.

The automaker, backed by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, is breaking from the traditional dealer model used by legacy brands and the factory-run service networks used by direct-sales brands such as Tesla.

Slate is partnering with RepairPal — a recommendation platform owned by Yelp — to connect customers with shops certified to work on its vehicles, including warranty repairs, the automaker said.

“In an industry first, Slate will offer customers simplified, transparent service through certified RepairPal service centers in the neighborhoods where Slate’s customers live,” the company said.

The automaker’s first vehicle is a bare-bones pickup with no paint and roll-up windows, starting at about $25,000 before shipping charges, the company has said.

The “Blank Slate” pickup can be upgraded with hundreds of accessories, including vinyl wraps and a cargo-bed kit that adds seats and a roof, converting it into a crossover.

The accessories are designed for do-it-yourself installation, but Slate said its network of independent shops can also do that work.

RepairPal said in July it reached 4,000 repair shops nationwide under its certification program. The network includes independent garages as well as franchise chains such as Big O Tires and Meineke Car Care Centers, according to listings on RepairPal’s online platform.

Sign up for the weekly Automotive News Mobility Report newsletter for the latest developments at the intersection of transportation and technology.

In the fine print on its press release, Slate said the service centers are typically within 100 miles and warranty service may not be available at all locations.

“For electrical and battery-related repairs that only a pro should handle, select RepairPal shops will be trained in Slate-specific procedures and able to perform high-voltage service,” Slate said. “Over 200 locations are already certified by RepairPal to handle high-voltage repairs on electric vehicles.”

Jeremy Snyder, Slate’s chief commercial officer, told Automotive News he doesn’t expect pushback from customers about using independent shops. In states that require manufacturers or dealers to handle warranty repairs, Slate will offer alternatives, he said.

“Being able to give that opportunity to the majority of our customers to service vehicles close to where they live is very important to us,” Snyder said. “And we think it’s going to be a great customer experience.”

The bipartisan legislation would also set aside funding to boost nuclear- or hydrogen-related education and scholarship programs.

House Bills 4124-4129 next will be considered by the Democratic-controlled Senate. The House passed them on votes ranging between 78-26 and 85-19 votes.

Small modular reactors, or SMRs, are smaller than traditional reactors and are modular, meaning they can be made in a factory and installed on site, and are potentially cheaper. They are novel but seen by nuclear proponents as a promising way to decarbonize the grid during the transition from fossil fuel-fired electricity.

Holtec International, which plans to reopen the Palisades nuclear plant near South Haven in Van Buren County, wants to build two 300-megawatt SMRS at the site, with a target of 2030 for commercial operation.

The six-bill package would provide a corporate income tax credit for nuclear research-and-development expenses, capped at an aggregate of $25 million annually, and for the sale of electricity generated using small modular reactors, capped at $10 million per site over 10 years.

The legislation would create a program so Michigan could award grants to universities, colleges, community colleges and technical schools that offer nuclear- or hydrogen-related instruction. The state would provide financial support to in-state or out-of-state graduates who commit to working at a Michigan nuclear or hydrogen power for at least three years.

The bills ""create incentives for research and development, expand education and training, and build a framework that attracts investment, creates jobs and strengthens our energy independence,"" said Rep. Pauline Wendzel, a Republican from Berrien County's Bainbridge Township and chair of the House Energy Committee.

Two nuclear plants are operating in Michigan: Columbus, Ohio-based American Electric Power's 2,300-megawatt Cook facility in Berrien County and Detroit-based DTE Electric's 1,100-megawatt Fermi facility in Monroe County. They account for about 20% of in-state power generation.

DTE is studying an expansion of Fermi to help power new mega data centers.

The 800-megawatt Palisades facility was closed in 2022 but will be restarted if Jupiter, Florida-based Holtec secures federal approval. The state has committed $300 million toward the effort.

“With the Palisades Nuclear Power Plant set to make history as the first decommissioned plant to be revived, Michigan has a unique opportunity to attract cutting-edge technologies, highly specialized industries, and top-tier talent,"" Rep. Joey Andrews, D-St. Joseph, said when the legislation was introduced. ""These bills will build a talent pipeline that not only supports our existing nuclear infrastructure at Palisades, Cook, and Fermi, but also fosters innovation in advanced reactors and hydrogen energy.""

The measures are supported by business groups, utilities, unions, universities, community colleges and some environmental organizations. The Sierra Club, an environmental group, opposes the bills.

""While proponents claim Small Modular Nuclear Reactors (SMRs) are a clean and innovative energy solution, the reality is that they are an expensive, unproven technology that diverts critical public funds away from more cost-effective and immediately available renewable energy options,"" Tim Minotas, deputy legislative and political director for the environmental group's Michigan chapter, wrote to the House Energy Committee in March.

Carolyn Kissane, academic director and clinical professor at the Center for Global Affairs at New York University, leads the conversation on the geopolitics of oil. FASKIANOS: Thank you. Welcome to the final session of the Winter/Spring 2023 CFR Academic Webinar Series. I’m Irina Faskianos, vice president of the National Program and Outreach here at CFR. Today’s discussion is on the record. And the video and transcript will be available on our website, CFR.org/Academic, if you would like to share these materials with your colleagues or classmates. As always, CFR takes no institutional positions on matters of policy. We are delighted to have Carolyn Kissane with us to discuss the geopolitics of oil. Dr. Kissane is the academic director of both the graduate program in global affairs and the graduate program in global security conflict and cybercrime at NYU’s Center for Global Affairs, where she is also a clinical professor. She also serves as director of the energy, climate justice, and sustainability lab in the School of Professional Studies at NYU. She was named in 2013 by Breaking Energy as one of the top ten New York women in energy, and top ten energy communicator. She’s a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and the National Committee on U.S.-China Relations, and serves on several boards. So, Carolyn, thanks very much for doing this. We really appreciate it. I thought we could begin by talking about how has the geopolitics of oil changed, especially vis-à-vis Russia’s war in Ukraine and OPEC’s recent announcement to cut oil production? KISSANE: Well, first of all, I’d just like to say, thank you so very much for having me. I’m really delighted. I am a big fan of CFR’s Academic Webinars. So, to have the opportunity to participate in this—in this way is very meaningful to me. So, thank you. So, wow. There is so much happening in this space, the geopolitics of oil. This has been a tremendous fourteen months. Russia’s reinvasion of Ukraine very much upended the geopolitics of oil because Russia is a significant producer, one of the top three in the world. And it’s—you know, it’s caused a kind of a reshaping, a kind of a remapping of the—of oil geopolitics. And we’ve seen some, you know, shifts in how countries think about oil security, in light of larger questions about broader energy security questions. And also, on top of that, is the ongoing energy transition, coupled with, you know, climate change, and the need to decarbonize. So, there’s just—it’s been quite a—you know, a year and a half, that has really sort of put energy security, and oil security, very much at the forefront of people’s minds. FASKIANOS: Fantastic. I thought maybe you had some really interesting data to show us. And if you could walk us through those—the trends you are seeing and really bring it to life, that would be fantastic. KISSANE: Sure. So, before I do—I have a couple of slides. And before I share my slides, I think it’s really important that, sort of, we understand how interconnected, sort of, the global energy system is, and how interconnected we are, when it comes to the flows of oil. You know, some countries are very well resourced-endowed, so they have oil. And other countries do not, so they need to import oil. There’s really no country in the world that doesn’t need oil for larger national security issues. And I think one of things that many people sort of are not necessarily aware of or think about, is the amount of oil that gets produced every day. So, every day, the world consumes over 100 million barrels a day. And every day, that 100 million barrels has to be—has to be moved. It has to be—you know, as part of getting it into the system, getting it to its respective destinations. And what we’re not seeing—which, maybe some people may have thought that we would see at this point—is we’re not seeing a reduction in demand, but we’re seeing an expansion in demand. And much of that global demand is coming out of Asia. And we’re also, of course, seeing the—with the reopening of China, lots of really interesting questions as to what oil demand will be in China for the 2023-2024 years, whether or not they will—they will, sort of, put extra pressure on global demand. And you know, Irina, just also, you know, it’s—I’m going to share this in my slides. But you know, last week’s decision from OPEC+ to reduce production, of course, had an impact on the price of oil. So when the decision was announced on Sunday, by Monday morning, we saw an uptick in the price. It’s stabilized, but we are sort of looking at $80-plus-a-barrel oil. And again, lots of uncertainty as to what that’s going to mean across economies that are in recessions, experiencing sort of the beginnings of a recession, and sort of what does it mean for the global economy, where we may see sort of more energy inflation. So, one of the things that I really like to do when I teach the geopolitics of oil is sort of show some visuals. Because I think, again, sort of, really reinforcing the interconnected nature of our global energy system, but also sort of seeing where in the world is oil produced, and where in the world are the—are the importers. And also, just a couple of sort of fun pieces on what we have seen, just this—you know, in the last week, of course, some of this—you’ll be familiar with, those in the audience—but this decision on the part of OPEC to reduce production by 1.2 million barrels a day—again, happening at a time, not when we have an excess supply, but when we’re seeing a tight supply across the oil market. So, it came as a bit of a surprise to—you know—to even the most, you know, longstanding analysts and OPEC observers. And again, part of this is directed probably toward self-interests on the part of Saudi Arabia and the oil producers that are really going to make the cuts. But of course, it also has an impact here for those of you that are sitting in the United States. What does it mean then for prices that Americans pay at the gas pump? So, the Biden administration sort of came out after this decision was made in sort of being disappointed, surprised that OPEC would make this decision. Now, it’s also important to sort of recognize that this is not just a singular OPEC decision. This is part of, now, a larger OPEC+. And OPEC+ does also include Russia, as well as other countries like Kazakhstan and Mexico. So, the OPEC that we have historically known is now different, because you have other countries that are not official members but nonetheless are part of what we now refer to as OPEC+. And these are the countries that are part of OPEC, and really the country that’s considered to be sort of in the driver’s seat of OPEC is that of Saudi Arabia, because Saudi Arabia is the largest producer within the OPEC organization, producing anywhere from 10 to 11 million barrels a day. Venezuela has the largest reserves, but it is far from being at capacity, in terms of what it can—what it can produce. So, just to kind of put that into perspective, these are OPEC countries and their respective reserves. And then non-OPEC—the United States being a non-OPEC country, but again, this sort of—this chart to the right shows, you know, again, the world is consuming a little over 100 million barrels a day, expected to increase over 2023 and into 2024, question marks as to when we may see peak oil demand. But again, to sort of link this to energy security—energy security, especially when it’s in the context of oil security—is making sure that we have adequate supply at affordable prices. So, when we see a reduction in supply at a time of tight markets, that suggests that we’re also going to see higher prices that’s going to directly hit vulnerable economies. And so, again, just to sort of point out sort of where in the world sort of are the top three oil producers: the United States, Saudi Arabia, and Russia. Russia remains in the top three. Canada as well, our, you know, neighbor to the north. And China is also a producer of oil. The United States figure here also includes gas liquefied, so liquid petroleum, which the United States is endowed with a lot of both oil and natural gas. And then the top oil consuming countries, you have U.S., China, and India. Now, the United States is not the largest importer. That position is now held by China. But as far as consumption goes, we consume over 20 million barrels a day. Again, big question mark about China, in terms of whether or not we will see higher demand coming out of China over the next year, two years, with China’s reopening and what is being, you know, discussed as revenge tourism. And more Chinese who have accumulated a lot of savings, 2.1 trillion, how are they going to use that savings and whether or not, after three years of being under lockdown restrictions, whether or not we’ll see impacts to demand. And I think Russia is—there’s lots of questions about Russia. And this is now—we’re fourteen months into, you know, Russia’s reinvasion of Ukraine—and I emphasize reinvasion, because oftentimes, we forget that, you know, Russia invaded Ukraine in 2014. But Russia is still moving its oil. And up until, you know, a few months ago, its overall production and exports were as high—at some points, even higher—than pre-invasion. Now, you have new countries that are takers of Russian oil, and they’re buying it at discounted prices. We see Turkey, Singapore, China has been a big buyer, as well as India, that they have been buying discounted Russian oil. Lots of interesting questions that we could discuss about the oil price cap and seaborne embargo to Europe. But I think the takeaway from this slide is that Russia continues to produce oil, continues to sell it, selling at a discounted price, but there are still many countries in the world that are eager to take Russian oil. And again, I’m not going to go into this, but I just love this slide, to just emphasize the—you know, the world’s pipelines. These are the pipelines that help sort of the transit of oil. Something also that’s really unique and interesting to look at is just tanker traffic, so, the tankers that carry oil around the world. But again, you know, there are a lot of pipelines, so twenty-three—two thousand, three hundred, and eighty-one operational oil and gas pipelines. Again, these are—it’s moving a lot of the oil that is consumed every day. And then finally, is this—is—you know, one of the things that we oftentimes—we think about the hundred million barrels a day that the world is consuming, over 75 percent of the world’s oil is controlled, managed by state-owned oil companies. So, Saudi Aramco being one, PDVSA of Venezuela being another. But it’s really important to sort of recognize the position that state-owned companies have. The rest is controlled or managed by international oil companies—ExxonMobil, Chevron, ENI, Total, and a host of other—host of other companies. But again, I think the—you know, to understand that NOCs, as they’re referred to, are very, very important for understanding their role in the larger context of the geopolitics of oil. And again, what we saw last week coming out of OPEC, this decision, this is also being driven by state budget concerns. This is—again, it’s about the production of oil, but it’s also about, you know, governments and their budgets. And oftentimes, you know, there is a desire to add more, rather than—you know, more revenues rather than less. So, those are the slides that I have. And I hope that they sort of provide some sort of context, and a little bit of, you know, that we can discuss in the questions that I really look forward to answering from the audience. FASKIANOS: Thank you, Carolyn. That was great. So now, we’re going to go to all of you for your questions and comments. (Gives queuing instructions.) All right, so I’m going to go to the first raised hand in the thing. Amadine Hom, go to you first, and please accept the—unmute yourself. (Pause.) You are still muted. (Pause.) OK, I don’t know—are you there? Oh, I think—OK. Let’s go to Morton Holbrook. Q: Yes, good afternoon. Dr. Kissane, what a shocking presentation—(laughs)—a hundred million barrels a day and it’s going up, notwithstanding the Paris Climate Agreement of 2015. Is that agreement simply a dead letter, or is it having any effect on oil—on fossil fuel production, particularly oil production? Or what’s the best scenario, in terms of reducing dependence on fossil fuels, considering the oil market? Thank you. KISSANE: Well—hi, Morton, thank you so much for that excellent question. Yeah, that’s kind of why I emphasize that number, is because a lot of people sort of just aren’t aware of how much oil we continue to consume, and again, what the demand expectations are moving forward. And these demand expectations are, you know, coming out of forecasts from the International Energy Agency. So, I think there’s a big question as to when we see peak demand. And, you know, if you look at BP scenarios, they expect peak demand to happen, you know, before 2030, where, as, you know, others kind of contest that they—that they think that peak demand won’t happen until after 2030. I mean, again, a lot depends on, you know, what we are now experiencing in the energy transition, and how, sort of quickly are we—can we transition away from oil. I think what’s really critical, when we’re looking at oil, is oftentimes we think only about the transportation sector. So we’re thinking about cars, we’re thinking about planes, you know, we’re thinking about trucks, and tankers, and all these things. But it’s petrochemicals, you know? There’s just a lot of oil that also goes into fertilizer. So, it really is across our economy, and across economies, across the global system. One of the things that I always tell my students is even during COVID, where you had many countries, right, much of the world was experiencing some level of lockdown, we did have a reduction in oil demand, but it wasn’t—it wasn’t like 20 million barrels. It was under ten. So, the fact that now it’s 2023, the world has reopened, it’s really hard to sort of see, or to know with certainty, is when we’re going to see that—see that reduction in demand. Now, I think with the Paris Agreement, what’s also important is—to note is, you know, if you’re—if you’re in the oil and gas space—and I was just at a conference earlier this morning where this was a point of conversation—was, you know, what are the companies doing to reduce the emissions from production? So, how are they integrating carbon capture, sequestration, you know, how are they managing the emissions that come from the production of fossil energy—in this case that we’re talking about, oil. And I think one of the things that—I think if you sort of follow oil markets, or a country like Saudi Arabia, they are marketing low-emission oil. Now, we could—you know, we could sort of challenge, well, what does that—you know, what does that really mean? But you are having, you know, countries that are now sort of competing to state that they have lower emitting carbon in the production—in the production of oil. And that’s a whole other interesting sort of thing to look at, in the context of the geopolitics of oil, is to kind of understand the variation across emissions, across different countries, in the production of oil. So, we are—you know, again, we are going to be going into COP-28 this fall. Again, we are not seeing—you know, and we haven’t seen a, you know, reduction in fossil energy demand. Again, lots of people are sort of, you know, hoping that we’ll start to see it sooner rather than later. But for the time being—and again, you know, to Irina’s first question, that, you know, the last fourteen months, and with, you know, with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, it has both shown us that, you know, Europe is sort of seeking to hasten the energy transition, by building out more renewable energy, and creating more opportunities to buy electric vehicles. But there’s still big swaths of the world that, you know, are still, and have yet to move towards, you know, really reducing—and that are actually going to see higher demand moving forward, as their economies grow. FASKIANOS: Thank you. I’m going to take the next question from Jovana Vujanic, who is a graduate student at Lewis University: How big of an—of an impact will the decision of the Saudi energy minister to cut oil production have on the relationship between the United States and Saudi Arabia? KISSANE: Love the question, thank you so much. Yeah, no, it’s a great one. So, my take is that, of course, this decision came as a bit of a surprise, and it wasn’t something that the United States, you know, wanted. But I would say that the U.S.-Saudi relationship has been very tense for the last ten years. And as part of that—there are lots of different reasons for that, but this is yet—kind of another thing that Saudi has done. And again, I think it’s also—Saudi has taken a non-alignment policy with relation to its position on Russia and Ukraine. So, it continues to—you know, it continues to have a relationship with Russia. It also has the relationship with Ukraine. As we saw, you know, China just brokered a very significant deal between Saudi Arabia and Iran. You know, again, Saudi Arabia and Iran are two—are two important producers for China. So, China is a large importer of oil. So, if you go back to World War—the end of World War II, that’s when the United States established the oil-for-security relationship with Saudi Arabia. And as we have grown, sort of, more—I wouldn’t say independent, but our—as our own oil production has increased, especially through the shale revolution, our dependence on the Middle East and Saudi Arabia, more specifically, has shifted. So, I think we’re seeing a very different Saudi Arabia today, which I think is going to be a challenge for the United States. I think it’s going to be very interesting to see what the summer holds. Last summer, the Biden administration did tap into the U.S. strategic petroleum reserves, the largest—the largest take in the history of the reserves, which started in 1975, you know, taking 180 million barrels out, you know, not because there was massive supply disruptions. But because, you know, as the administration said, it was—you know, it was—it was—it was a war—it was a war-specific decision, because the—you know, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine was causing energy prices to skyrocket. And to cushion the American consumer, and to better cushion the, sort of, the global economy, the United States withdrew from the SPR. So I think the summer is going to be very interesting. But I think we’re going to see, definitely, much more attention in the years to come, between the United States and Saudi Arabia. It’s not the relationship of the past. This is a kind of a very new relationship. That’s a great question. FASKIANOS: Thank you. Thank you, let’s go Curran Flynn, who has a raised hand. Q: Hello? FASKIANOS: We can hear you, but we’re getting feedback. So you might have two devices open. Q: Can you hear me now? FASKIANOS: Yes. Q: That’s better. OK. FASKIANOS: That’s better. Thank you. Thank you so much. Q: So, I’m here at King Fahd University in Saudi Arabia, right next to Aramco, here with my class from international relations. And one of my students has a question, Nasser al-Nasir (ph). Here he is. Q: So, thank you, Mrs. Carolyn. My question is: How could Russia’s use of alternative transportation methods, such as the East Siberian Pipeline to China, impact the U.S. market, the domestic market, and the role of the SPR, given potential insurance workarounds from Russia’s side such as ensuring Russian tankers through their RDIF fund? And thank you to Mrs. Irina. KISSANE: Thank you. And, Dr. Flynn, thank you so much for having your students join this webinar. So, I’m a little—so, the question is about the East Siberian Pipeline? Just could you—would you mind repeating it? I just want to make sure I have it—I’m clear on the question. Q: So, how could Russia’s use of alternative transportation methods, such as the East Siberian Pipeline to China, impact the U.S. energy markets, I mean domestically, and the SPR, given potential insurance workarounds from Russia’s side such as ensuring Russian tankers to the RDIF fund? KISSANE: Yeah, and that’s a great question. You know, I think that, you know, begs a lot of things that we could be looking at, right, in terms of, you know, Russia’s kind of ability or capacity to sort of work around, or find workarounds, to the sanctions that were imposed. And I think we’ve seen sort of new markets—so, this kind of reshaping of the energy map with oil, we see that as—kind of in technicolor, right, whereas, you know, a lot of Russian oil would go west, is now going east, you know, China, India, being takers, and of course, you know, other countries as well. You know, what will be its impact on the—on the U.S. market? I think that’s—you know, again, I do think the sanctions were sort of carefully put into place, so that there wouldn’t be massive disruptions, so we—again, you know, Russia produces over 10 million barrels a day, and about 7 million of those barrels are exported. So, you know, if we lost all of that, that would be a—you know, that would cause some very significant economic disruption globally. We already saw, you know, impacts to sort of grains, grain exports, and food security in many different parts of the world. So, you know, Russia is finding different ways. You have shadow tankers that Russia is using to move—to move its oil—as you pointed out, the East Siberian pipeline. You know, I think there’s only so much the United States can do, or—and European countries that are part of the sanctions regime, can do to curtail Russian exports of oil. But I think that—you know, I think Russia, again, has a—has a desire, and also, you know, revenue needs—they’re funding a very expensive war—that they’re finding ways to get their—to get their oil out. I think an interesting question is, you know, what does this mean in the years ahead, the lack of investment, for example, that’s going into Russian energy infrastructure, a lack of, sort of, any kind of Western investment that is—that is going in, and what that is going to mean. But again, you know, I think, to your question, I think we will see some—you know, we are seeing some impacts, right? There’s a big question as to what—you know, what the next six months to a year will look like, with regards to the reduction from OPEC, and if we were to see a deeper curtailment on Russian oil. And you know, would the United States then tap more into the SPR? We’re now at—you know, we’re down to seven hundred thousand barrels, which, of course, is not insignificant. But we also sort of have to be, you know, judicious about how we use the SPR. But thank you for the question. FASKIANOS: Thank you. I’m going to take the next question from Michael—let’s see— Trevett, a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Southern Mississippi: China and other countries claim there are petroleum reserves under the South China Sea. What are your estimates of the potential amount there, and has China begun to extract any of this oil? KISSANE: Michael, thank you so much. That’s a great question. So, China already is an oil producing country, so you do have oil production in China. In the South China Sea, I can’t—I can’t say exactly. I know that there have been geological tests that have shown the reserves. Again, you do have—you know, you do have territorial concerns about sort of where—is this—you know, can China—can China tap those—or seek to explore and tap those reserves, again, if there are—if there is contention over the territory in which these reserves are located? So you know, China, again—one of the things that’s very interesting about China is that China is an oil producer, but China has seen, over the last, you know, the last decade, they have seen that they have experienced peak demand. So—I mean, sorry. Peak supply. So, they are not producing as much as they used to. And so you’re seeing a year-on-year reduction in the producing capacity. You know, if you go back maybe five or six years ago, there was lots of questions about if China could kind of replicate what happened in the United States around the shale oil revolution. I think one of the big challenges for China is that, of the—you know, where the shale reserves are located, it’s not near water, lots of questions as to—and some of it—basically, some of the tests have shown that it’s—it definitely is proving harder that, you know, they cannot sort of model the same level of development that we have seen in the United States. So, yeah, no, I think in the South China Sea, again, I think we—it’s potentially possible that we might see it. I wouldn’t—I wouldn’t—I wouldn’t say it’s soon. FASKIANOS: Thank you. I’m taking the next question from Rob Warren at the Anglo-American University of Prague. This question also got an upvote: How do you foresee Venezuela’s role in the global oil market changing moving forward? And can it be reintegrated into the global economy? KISSANE: Oh, these are all fantastic questions. Thank you all so much. Yeah, Venezuela is—again, you know, Venezuela has—they have the largest reserves in the world. As part of this webinar, right, you—CFR had a—kind of a primer on Venezuelan, and kind of—you know, you look at sort of where Venezuela is. And one of the biggest challenges confronting Venezuela is both its politics, but it’s also—it basically—you know, you don’t have—you don’t have international oil service providers in the country. I think the only—the only one now that the U.S.—the U.S. has sort of given a sanctions exemption to, is that of Chevron. But I think—yeah, I mean, if you were to see, you know, kind of shifts in the political regime, and you were to see more openness, then I think you could imagine, you know, Venezuela having an opportunity, or a pathway forward, to be more integrated into the global energy system, and the global oil system. You know, I think one of the big problems that Venezuela faces is that most of its infrastructure is really old at this point. And it would need a significant amount of reinvestment to get it up to a place that it could sort of meet its potential. So, you know, Venezuela is one of these countries that’s not producing as much as it could, right? It has the potential to be producing 2 million-plus more barrels per day. But you know, we’ve seen that they really have just—they went into freefall. So, I think that’s a big issue. And another big issue, which—God, it goes back to an earlier question—is that of emissions. So, the oil that comes out of Venezuela is a very, very heavy oil. So, it’s—it has very large carbon emissions associated with the production of that oil. So, that, I think, is—again, as we—you know, think about the emissions from oil production in countries that are sort of seeking to kind of market themselves as low-emission producers, you know, Venezuela definitely will have a very hard time recouping its—where its oil sector was. Again, it has the capacity, it has the reserves. But getting that—getting that oil out of the ground right now, you have a lot of significant above-ground risks. FASKIANOS: Thank you. I’m going to go next to Clemente Abrokwaa. Raised hand, so please unmute yourself. Q: Can you hear me, please? FASKIANOS: Yes, we can. Q: Thank you. Thank you so much for your—for your talk. I was also very shocked about the amount of barrels that we consume every day. (Laughs.) I didn’t know that. But anyway, I’m from Penn State University. And my question is: You just mentioned about the above-ground, you know, effects. And—so the movement towards, like, electric vehicles and so on, how do you think it is going to affect the African continent? KISSANE: Thank you. Q: I am—I’m thinking, you know, the economies, and then infrastructure. It will be very difficult for them to—(laughs)—move with the rest of the world in terms of electric vehicles, and so on. I just wanted your take on that. KISSANE: Thank you, Clemente. It’s an excellent question. Yeah, I mean, you have countries across the African continent that not only have oil reserves, but are already producing, right? Nigeria is a—is an oil-producing country, also has more capacity, but again, you have some above-ground risks. You also have the need for investment of new infrastructure. I think one of the things that has been very interesting—and I think it’s getting—it’s getting more attention, as it deserves, is how Western governments are—some of—I think a challenge across Africa is that a lot of Western governments have sort of said, listen, we’re not going to invest in fossil fuels—or also, financial institutions, Western financial institutions—we’re not going to invest in fossil fuels, or new projects that are fossil-based. And that—you know, that’s problematic when you look across the African continent, where you still don’t have, you know, 100 percent energy access. You know, the idea of the transition to electric vehicles, which is taking a very, very long time, even here across the—across developed economies—so the need for the infusion of more capital to go into, you know, across the continent of Africa for oil and gas, that’s for their economies and for their own economic growth, I think, is really, really pivotal. And I think this is something that, you know, is being discussed across multilateral financial institutions. And also, you know, is it hypocrisy, right, for Western banks that have, you know, kind of funded the oil and gas industry, or helped to fund the oil and gas industry in the United States and many different parts of the world, and that are now sort of not allowing those funds to flow to Africa. And they have the—again, they have the—they have the resources. So you know, is it—you know, the equity of some of these decisions that are being made, I think, is one that’s—is one that’s really important. And again, I—you know, I said earlier in this talk, is that, you know, all—most of the demand for oil is not coming from North America and from Europe. All of the demand that we’re seeing and new demand that we’re going to see, is coming from Asia, and is going to come from Africa. So again, you know, how are we going to make sure that that demand is met, again, going back to that idea of energy security, so there is—there is accessibility, so there is reliable sources of energy at affordable prices, you know, without sort of thinking about kind of a whole-of-energy approach. So, I think it’s very—it’s a very complex issue. And I think, you know, Western banks who have sort of taken very sharp positions on what they will and will not fund, when it comes to new oil and gas projects, are getting sort of challenged as to, you know, what does that mean, then, for, you know, countries across Africa that are still very much in need of more energy, not less. And again, recognizing that, you know, EVs that, again, are still—are—you know, we’re seeing adoption here in the United States and across Europe, but it’s a big, big, big adoption in China. But it’s very uneven. So how do we ensure greater energy security for the continent of Africa, I think, is a really critical question. FASKIANOS: Thank you. I’ll take the next question from Kyle Bales, who is a senior at Lewis University in Romeoville, Illinois: How is the war between Russia and Ukraine having an effect on the progress of the European Green Deal? Maybe you can tell us what the European—define the European Green Deal for us, Carolyn, give us the context for that. KISSANE: Yes, so, again, this is another fantastic question. Yeah, the European Green Deal, it’s—this is—this is great. Yeah, I mean, a lot of people would say that the European Green Deal now is—that the—Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has sort of said, hey, this is why the Green Deal is so important. This is why we really need to more quickly transition to renewable energy, because look what—look what happened when we were dependent on Russia for over 30 percent of our natural gas. And look, when Russia, you know, illegally invades Ukraine and suddenly weaponizes gas, we are left very energy-insecure. It affects—it affects consumers. It affects industry across the continent. So, I think we’re seeing, not just through the Green Deal, but we’re also seeing through, sort of European green industrial policy—so in some ways, akin to what, you know, we put into effect in—this past summer, is the Inflation Reduction Act. And we’re seeing almost, kind of, this industrial competition around clean energy technologies. And so, Europe is investing—you know, I think it’s about $250 billion, the United States, it’s about 370 billion—towards the—kind of the energy transition, and helping to support domestic industries and companies to—you know, to be able to, you know, develop the technologies, and to have the, you know, the opportunity to contribute to the energy transition. So, I think one thing, though—whenever I talk about Europe, it’s really important, is to sort of recognize that, you know, when you look across Europe, you have very different policies and kind of approaches, to sort of thinking about energy, and how quickly some countries want to transition and can transition, whereas others, you know, are probably going to experience a slower transition. So, just really interesting example, as you talked about the Green Deal, is the EU taxonomy, the green taxonomy, that went into effect in the—January of 2022. And there, you had, like, really a lot of contention between France and Germany, because France wanted to make sure that nuclear was part of the green taxonomy. Germany was opposed, right, but Germany wanted to make sure natural gas was part of the green taxonomy. So ultimately, in the end, both natural gas and nuclear—and again, this was—this predated Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. But in the EU green taxonomy, you have—you know, you have both nuclear and natural gas, in addition to other renewable energies that can make up this taxonomy, that includes specific measures towards adaptation and mitigation for climate change. So you know, I think you’re seeing this kind of—some people call it a race, a competition. You know, ideally, it’s—you know, we’re kind of working together to—because we’re all sort of going in the same direction—to, you know, support the transition, and to reduce—to reduce carbon emissions, and to bring in more, sort of, cleaner energy technologies into our system. FASKIANOS: Thank you. I’m going to take the next question from Dr. Laeed Zaghlami. Q: Yes, good afternoon. This is Laeed—good afternoon, Irina. Good afternoon, Carolyn. I’m very pleased to be part of your program. Just to—want to be back to Africa and particularly to Nigeria, how practical the two projects that Nigeria is advocating for pipelines, one from—through Algeria, and the other one to Morocco through western African countries? How practical are these pipelines to supply gas to Europe and parts of some African countries? FASKIANOS: And Dr. Zaghlami, you are at Algiers University, correct? Q: Indeed, Irina, yes. I am professor at University of Algiers, faculty of information and communication. FASKIANOS: Thank you. KISSANE: Dr. Laeed, can I—can I keep you on for just one second? Can I ask you, what is the—what is the status right now? Is it—it’s planned, under construction? Where is—what is the status of those two pipelines? My understanding is that it’s—they’re proposed, but— Q: Yes, well, actually in—practically, the pipeline between Algeria and Abuja, which means through Niger and so forth, is already in progress, whereas the other project, through thirteen western African countries, they are supposed to be implemented by 2047. But is it—is there any political game or something of strategic—(inaudible)—how practical, how logical, how efficiently will be for Nigeria to have two similar project(s)? KISSANE: Yeah, no, it’s—again, thank you for the question. You know, pipelines, again, that’s why I wanted to show the—(laughs)—kind of the map of pipelines, is because, you know, a lot of pipelines transverse, you know, multiple countries, right? And this is—this requires not just, you know, a lot of cooperation, but it requires technically. It also can be very complex to build—to build pipelines. And when you’re talking about something like, as you—as you point out, these are, you know, crossing many countries. You know, I think one of the—again, one of the issues is whether or not—since, you know, what already is under construction, I think you can, you know, with confidence, that one will be completed. Anything that’s not yet under construction—and again, the timeline, 2047, is way out there—a lot of—a lot of uncertainty as to what the status of those projects will be moving forward, for various reasons, in terms of making sure that the investments are there. Someone I know that studies pipelines, he says, you know, until the steel is in the ground, you don’t have the pipeline, and so until you know that you’ve got that, you know, you’ve got all the OKs, and you feel that kind of security of being able to build it, and being able to provide the resources to supply it and to move it. I think Algeria has been a really interesting case that hasn’t gotten enough attention, in terms of Algerian gas, that has—that has helped support Europe. Over the last years, we’ve seen an increase in Algerian gas going into Europe. Again, a lot of attention on U.S. LNG and the increase of liquefied natural gas exports into Europe, but also Algeria has been, you know, very important for helping to support European energy security, and make up for some of the losses of the—of the Russian gas. And I think we’ll see more attention on Algeria, and Algeria’s role as a—you know, as an important source of energy, especially, you know, gas, going into—going into Europe, moving forward. FASKIANOS: So, I’ll take the next written question from Vincent Brooks, who is at Harvard and Diamondback Energy board of directors: How do you view the purchasing of discounted Russian oil by India, in particular relative to the purchasing by China? How are they using the oil purchased? And are you seeing more internal usage or external profit-making sales in places like Africa? And what are the implications of all of this? KISSANE: Right, great. Great question. So, all of the above—(laughs)—in some ways, right? There is definitely sort of profits that are being made. You know, I was—I was talking about this last week with someone, and you know, if you sort of put your shoe—put yourself in the shoes of India, right, so, India is a—is a rapidly growing economy, 1.4 billion. You know, if you had—if you have very high energy inflation and high oil prices, that’s going to have ripples effects across the Indian economy. And so, you know, when you have a kind of opportunity to buy, you know, pretty steep discounted oil, which, you know, they had been able to buy from Russia, you know, for purposes of national security, they’ve been buying the oil. And one of the things that’s very interesting about India is that, actually, India has been building out its refining capacity. So, a lot of that oil is both for domestic, and some of it is being sort of re-exported. But I think what we’ve seen is that they’re using that oil to also sort of enhance their capacity and capabilities as a rapidly emerging, refining power in Asia. And we see that in some ways in China, too. So, China, even though oil demand was down in 2022, much of the oil that they were buying from Russia went into its strategic supplies, which, you know, they now have access to. And again, I think, you know, a big question is what we’re going to see moving forward around oil demand in China. Wood Mackenzie just published a really interesting piece, kind of very bullish, on the expectations for oil demand in China, so whether or not they’re going to continue to buy, you know, Russian oil—and again, sort of taking advantage of these lower prices, you know. And I think—I think one of the things that—it’s kind of an inconvenient truth, whereas a lot of this oil trading used to happen in Europe, so European trading houses were kind of the main—the main points of Russian oil trade. A lot of that has been moved out, so, you know, Russia has found ways to kind of bypass some of the sanctions, and have set up—in some cases, they’ve set up trading houses. And some of those trading houses have been sort of set up in places that, you know, that they can sort of, again, bypass the compliance to the sanctions. And you have some—you have some Russian oil traders that are making a lot of money—(laughs)—selling discounted oil, and then reselling it. A really interesting case, a couple of months ago, was out of Malaysia. Malaysia announced—or, in the, you know—that they were—that 1.5 million barrels were produced and sold, but only—Malaysia doesn’t produce that much. So, those were Russian barrels that were sort of being sold under, sort of, the Malaysian—under the Malaysian barrel. So, again, I think China and India have, you know, have taken advantage. Some of this has, again—as I said, has been re-exported. And some of it, you know, has been re-exported through petroleum products, because China and India, you know, both are building and have refining capacity. FASKIANOS: Thank you. I’m going to take the next question from Bhakti Mirchandani at Columbia University: What global trajectory do you see for nuclear? The Russia-Ukraine crisis has taken some of the refining capacity offline, and nuclear has the potential to change the geopolitics of energy. And so what steps can be taken to foster nuclear energy? KISSANE: Bhakti, thank you. And I was just at Columbia earlier today for the Center for Global Energy Policy’s conference. Yeah, nuclear is very interesting, right? So when we’re thinking about, you know, decarbonizing our energy systems, you know, nuclear plays a very important role, because it’s zero-emitting. So in certain parts of the world—China being one, Saudi Arabia—you know, you have a lot of new nuclear build. You know, in other parts of the world, you have a lot of contention about nuclear. We saw that even in Germany, which have, you know, three remaining nuclear power plants. And even in the midst of massive energy crisis over the last year, there was still sort of pushback about, no, those nuclear power plants need to be shut down, whereas you would think, OK, in light of energy insecurity, let’s keep them open. So, you know, France is an interesting country. France had planned to reduce its nuclear capacity by 50 percent. But this past year, they pivoted and they’ve said, no, we’re actually going to build out more nuclear, and we’re sort of—we’re totally scrapping that idea of reducing nuclear energy. And nuclear is very important for France’s electricity system. Sweden has also announced that they are going to build new nuclear, and they’re going to increase by, I think, almost 50 percent. Again, part of this is their—to meet their targets of net zero. We also see Japan. Japan, you know, the Fukushima disaster really turned Japanese—the Japanese public off of nuclear. Very, very deep opposition to restarting the nuclear power plants. But this past year, even though there’s still safety concerns on the part of the public, the public is also very concerned about energy insecurity and higher prices. So, nuclear being a domestic source of energy. So, I think when you look at, you know, net-zero pathways, I have not seen a net-zero pathway that does not include nuclear. So, here in the United States, the net-zero America project out of Princeton, very important place for nuclear. We just have a really hard time—(laughs)—building nuclear at cost, so it’s very expensive. Usually, it’s significant cost overruns. And of course, there is the—I think they have a really significant PR problem. People—there’s still a lot of concern about the safety of nuclear. So, I think to your point, it’s very, very important for decarbonizing energy systems, but you’re going to see, I think, very disjointed approaches. Some countries are going—are embracing nuclear, and other countries are sort of doubling down on their opposition, and are not going to allow nuclear to be part of the energy system. FASKIANOS: We have so many questions, and we are just not going to get to them all. So, I’m going to take the next question from Christian Bonfili, who’s at Torcuato di Tella University in Argentina. So, do you think, Carolyn, that the landscape resulting from the Ukraine invasion by Russia, vis-à-vis securitization of gas and energy between Europe and Russia, could accelerate energy transition toward greener energy? KISSANE: Great question. I think in Europe, it is. And I think, you know, many analysts would agree that—the IEA, for example—you know, you had the, you know—how does Europe continue—you know, to enhance and achieve energy security without the dependence on Russia gas? And a lot of that is through renewable energy. You also have a lot of new attention on hydrogen, and the role that hydrogen will play. I think—I think Europe is being cautious, and so they are not saying that they are going to completely move away from gas, so as earlier questions, are they getting gas from Algeria, or are they getting gas from Norway? Are they getting more gas from the United States in the form of liquefied natural gas? And then also an uncomfortable truth is they continue to get liquefied natural gas from Russia. So, we’ve seen an increase in LNG from Russia going into Europe. That said, I think all in, you are seeing that, you know, countries across Europe are saying, OK, you know, how can we enhance our energy security? How do we build more sort of domestic energy sources? Solar, wind, we’re seeing, you know, more rapid deployment. You’ve got a lot of questions about supply chains and things like that, but I think—overall, I think the answer would be that it’s quickening the energy transition. FASKIANOS: So, I will take the moderator prerogative to just ask the final question for you to close on. And just to give us your top three—what are the major challenges for the geopolitics of oil, as you look out over the next five- to ten-year horizon, that you would leave us with, to be looking for? KISSANE: OK. You know, so I think what we saw, right, tensions between Saudi Arabia and the United States. We also have a, you know, a hot war, cold war, depending on, you know, the term you want to use, between the United States and China, and lots of sort of questions as to what that’s going to look like. I think there’s—you know, I think there’s concern that, you know, we’re not reducing demands, but we’re seeing tightening supply. And so that’s going to have, you know, very significant impacts for economies, especially economies that are already very fragile, economically fragile, politically fragile. So that concerns me a lot, in terms of, you know, what happens when, you know, economies don’t have adequate access to energy to make sure that their industries, that their—that consumers, you know, are able—that the lights can stay on, and you can get—you know, if you’re dependent on cars, you’re depending on trucks, like, all these kinds of things are really, really critical. So, I think we have to be very cautious moving forward, that we don’t take more out of the system before we have adequately set up the system to be resilient, and to be able to sort of meet the energy security demands that are not—are not—they’re not decreasing. I think they are increasing and becoming even more complex. So, I think there’s a lot of concerns and a lot of uncertainty. And you know, this definitely is going to be an area to watch in the years ahead. FASKIANOS: Carolyn Kissane—Kissane, excuse me—thank you very much for shaping and sharing this discussion, for sharing your terrific insights with us, and to all of you for your questions and comments.

By Rachel Morison

The U.S. government agreed a US$80 billion deal with Westinghouse Electric Co. to build nuclear reactors, the latest push to meet rising demand for electricity from artificial intelligence.

The strategic partnership — which also involves Brookfield Asset Management and Canadian uranium producer Cameco Corp. — aims to deliver on United States President Donald Trump’s AI ambitions and scale up an industry he sees as vital to competing with China. It will create tens of thousands of jobs, the companies said in a statement on Tuesday.

In the U.S., power consumption from data centres is set to double by 2035, to almost nine per cent of all demand, according to BloombergNEF. It’s causing a rush to build new power stations and secure grid connections. But building new reactors takes several years and some companies, like Google, are looking at reopening shuttered nuclear plants to try to get power quicker.

Each two-unit Westinghouse AP1000 project creates or sustains 45,000 manufacturing and engineering jobs in 43 states, and a national deployment will create more than 100,000 construction jobs, the companies said.

“The program will cement the United States as one of the world’s nuclear energy powerhouses and increase exports of Westinghouse’s nuclear power generation technology globally,” according to the statement.

Early-stage clean energy development is “inherently risky,” the report noted.
The company developed a standardized risk model to bring more early-stage projects to Notice to Proceed (NTP) stage.
The four archetypes are the most common recurring early-stage issues that can derail projects.
For example, developers can commission a full wetland delineation and report early, before committing Coordinated Electric System Interconnection Review (CESIR) funds, said Paces.","Over 70% to 90% of early-stage renewable energy projects fail to reach construction, said a whitepaper from Paces, a platform for renewable energy project development and de-risking.

Early-stage clean energy development is “inherently risky,” the report noted. Developers must advance projects across multiple dimensions simultaneously, securing site control, interconnection feasibility, permitting, and environmental and design constraints all while adhering to program rules and policies and staying within capital budgeting requirements.

“However, obtaining the information needed to make decisions across these dimensions is slow, tedious, and expensive,” said the whitepaper. “Public data is fragmented, unreliable, or missing entirely. As a result, the only way to reduce uncertainty is to push the project forward—spending time and capital just to acquire the information required to determine if it is worth continuing.”

Paces found that reducing the cost of acquiring reliable information and standardizing development risk could improve productivity, success rates and investor confidence. The company developed a standardized risk model to bring more early-stage projects to Notice to Proceed (NTP) stage.

The core principle of Pace’s risk assessment model is to reduce the most risk with the smallest budget as early in the development lifecycle as possible.

“Targeting high-risk, low-cost tasks early can accelerate confidence and reduce downstream delays,” said the whitepaper. “By concentrating spend on the milestones that remove the most uncertainty (which vary by site), projects can progress more efficiently toward NTP.”

According to Paces, the five primary risk categories for early-stage projects are:

Site Control

Interconnection

Permitting

Environmental

Design

The report went on to classify four different project archetypes based on reporting from utility data analytics platform Arcadia. The four archetypes are the most common recurring early-stage issues that can derail projects.

“By tailoring risk weights to the project’s archetype, developers can prioritize the most consequential milestones early and reduce wasted effort on low-probability paths to viability,” said Paces.

The four project archetypes defined by Paces are:

Environmental constraints

Sites near known environmental hazards or sensitive areas should allocate an early budget to field studies that assess constraints like wetlands, floodplains, or protected habitats to determine if the risks pose a fatal flaw. For example, developers can commission a full wetland delineation and report early, before committing Coordinated Electric System Interconnection Review (CESIR) funds, said Paces.

Permitting complexity and sentiment

In jurisdictions where public or political sentiment can slow or stop a project, community engagement is an important early step. For example, a developer can reduce this risk by meeting with town officials, fire departments and nearby residents to assess community sentiment before commissioning expensive studies, said Paces.

Design feasibility

Though a nearby substation could have available capacity, issues with line routing could derail a project. Developers should assess the cost and constructability of routing key infrastructure like tie lines and access roads, particularly where coordination with neighboring landowners or easements are needed.

Capacity viability

In regions where substations may appear to have limited capacity, but large volumes of projects are queued, developers may need to perform further studies. Queue data alone can be misleading, said the report, as many queued projects never proceed. The company recommends getting a preliminary review meeting with the utility as fast as possible to assess the likelihood that queued capacity is firm before committing to costly interconnection studies or land expenses.",https://pv-magazine-usa.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/05/6808e65e6c0fa5581f1de424_Permitting-Risk-1200x893.png,N,,2025-10-28 19:19:29.921559

Jillian Godshall: I know Acadiana naturalist Bill Fontenot is still a big mentor for you, could you introduce who he is?
He really was one of the first doing native gardening, and growing and selling native plants before it was cool.
Matt Conn: I knew I was gonna be gone for at least a year, and people change their minds.
And I think what most people don’t realize about native plants is they’re what wants to be here.","This is part of a series of stories that accompany our podcast, “No Matter the Water.” To hear from someone who is gardening at home with natives, you can listen to Episode 4, “De Sha.”

Three years ago when Jillian Godshall and I were just starting research for a podcast about the environment in South Louisiana, the first interview we landed on was with Matt Conn. He owns and runs an environmental and ecological consulting company, but more relevant to us was that he restored 67 acres from dirt to a mecca for nature lovers in the area.

Since then, Jillian and I worked together on the film Louisiana Grass Roots about our coastal prairies, and that podcast came to fruition and is called No Matter the Water. Full disclosure, I’m now also in a relationship with Matt Conn.

Jillian and I started with native plants because we knew how growing more natives can help solve a lot of our environmental problems: they are incredible at storing carbon, require less water, are better adapted to our weather, provide more biodiversity, and can filter out a lot of the chemicals that go into our waterways.

In the episode “De Sha,” we talk to a local gardener who had no success until she stumbled into native gardening. So we decided to circle back to where we started, for another perspective on the benefits of natives, and hopefully get your mind going on how to incorporate some of this into your own life. Below is a condensed and edited version of a conversation between Jillian and Matt.

Jillian Godshall: You grew up spending a lot of time outdoors and had a lot of mentors. Could you tell me about that?

Matt Conn: As long as I could remember, I would spend time at the Acadiana Park Nature Station, which has quite a few miles of trails and big woods and a sort of museum-like structure that’s like a tree house. I started as a volunteer worker there when I was really young, younger than 10, and did work around the nature station and guided some tours and night hikes and those sorts of things. I guess that planted the seed and it stuck. It was hard to not learn about whatever you were interested in because you had somebody there that had spent their whole life studying those things, and they were willing to share.

Now, I can’t go anywhere without stopping and spending a whole bunch of time staring at something that’s in the woods or in the prairie or in the swamp. It’s either a plant or a reptile or a bird or an insect, something’s gonna grab my eye.

Jillian Godshall: I know Acadiana naturalist Bill Fontenot is still a big mentor for you, could you introduce who he is?

Matt Conn: When I met Bill he was running Acadiana Park. He had a native plant nursery and was just a wealth of knowledge. And in the birding world he was already very well known too. By now he’s written quite a few books and pamphlets on native gardening. He really was one of the first doing native gardening, and growing and selling native plants before it was cool. Now there’s a lot of really well developed yards that are beautiful and native-scaped that were either done by, plants provided by, or consulted by Bill Fontenot.

He really inspired me to do my personal restoration because he bought tracks of land and then restored them to a more native landscape. Bill and his wife Lydia, in their neighborhood, bought some of the woods that were behind it and replanted it in native trees, shrubs and other grasses and things. They also bought lots that were meant to be developed and turned them back into forest as well. They wanted to be surrounded by nature, and they saw the importance in keeping that resource healthy. It’s different from the second you walk up. There’s more of everything that you would want to see.

Jillian Godshall: Could you tell me about your property and how it came to be?

Matt Conn: It was a work project. There was an entity that cleared several tracks of wetlands and didn’t go through the permit process. So they had to come up with a restoration plan or purchase mitigation banks, which is more expensive. The company I was working for at the time took on that job. We had restored two tracks and then when it came to do the third one, they made a comment one day that they might wanna sell it as long as somebody would take over the violation.

I couldn’t sleep that night, and I drove back to their office the next morning and said that if they really would let this land go for a reasonable price, I would take them up on it. I got a call about a week later, I went back, and I literally wrote a check and walked out with a cash deed for that property. That was in 2010. Two days after I bought it, I left on a deployment to Iraq for 18 months. So I bought it and I hadn’t been on the entire property.

It did take me about five years of planting and doing the restoration work just to get it kind of set and in place. And then at that point it was more of a maintenance. It’s got marsh habitat, bottomland hardwoods, a little bit of cypress swamp and some coastal prairie habitat. It’s about 67 acres, just south of Lydia, Louisiana.

Jillian Godshall: Why was it important to you to make sure that you secured the property before your deployment?

Matt Conn: I knew I was gonna be gone for at least a year, and people change their minds. For a lot of people the land was mostly useless, other than hunters. And even though I love to hunt, I don’t do it on the property at all, it’s become sort of its own preserve. And I’m surrounded by landowners that do hunt. I get bears and deer and bobcats and all those things. They become more prevalent during hunting season because now it’s been 15 years and nobody’s shot at them on my land. It’s kind of a safe zone.

To me it really is therapeutic just to be out in the quiet. When things get stressful, it is one of the places that I can go. Whether you find one spot and sit down and watch, or you just take a nice walk, you always come out in a better state than when you got there.

Jillian Godshall: This is a tremendous amount of work and ongoing maintenance. What drives you to keep that up?

Matt Conn: Yes, restoration is a lot of manual labor and it’s time consuming. But if you like being out there in it, then the work is also therapeutic. I had examples that I got to see. This wasn’t a pretty piece of property when I bought it, but neither was Bill Fontenot’s. I don’t have the opportunity or the capital to go buy a big chunk of land that has old growth forest or something close to it. And whether or not I live long enough to see the forest completely mature is okay. But my kids will.

Not all of my children are as enthralled by being in nature and doing work to preserve it as I was at their age. However, I always encourage them to come with me to visit or do work at the property, and to take outings in nature in general. All three of my children have enjoyed helping plant trees and spread prairie seed, and can now watch the fruits of those labors, and I think they all appreciate that.

I had this talk recently with one of my daughters. I told them a conservation servitude or a conservation easement is a legal document which would protect it and keep it that way. And my oldest daughter was like: “That’s a really good idea. We should do that.”

Jillian Godshall: Yeah. That’s an incredible inheritance. Why is that important to you? What will they be inheriting from this land?

Matt Conn: When you go to Chicot State Park or the Atchafalaya Basin and find some of the older areas that are still there — they get to have some of that, and it’ll be their property and they can share it. I bring out different groups, Master Naturalists and Louisiana Ornithological Society and LSU Youth Ag Groups.You don’t have to just lock the gate and keep it all to yourself, although it is nice to be able to go out and have that quiet place all to yourself if you want it.

And it’ll only get better over time. We have live oaks and cypress, I think I have about 30 different native tree types that are planted. Parts of the property are even tidal so when we get storm surges and hurricanes, some of those things will die back and get knocked over. And that’s just part of the natural world around us and how things evolve. But the ones that make it are just gonna be gnarlier and twisted and look great when they’re older.

Jillian Godshall: Do you have any advice for people who are looking to get started?

Matt Conn: Anybody can do it in their backyards. And you don’t have to do it all at once and make it a big ordeal either, you can put a little here and a little there. And I think what most people don’t realize about native plants is they’re what wants to be here. So it’s usually the one that grows the best and the fastest and reproduces easily, and is better at dealing with too wet or too dry conditions. So native plants usually are easier plants to grow.

Anybody can do it. And there are a lot of resources now and greenhouses where you can buy at a very affordable price. So you stick a few in this year and you stick a few in next year, and before you know it, you’ve got this great habitat at your house or at your little chunk of land. And it doesn’t have to be something that eats up all your time.

Jillian Godshall: Right? Yeah, I’ve seen that just in my own yard. As I was making Louisiana Grass Roots, I was seeing all of these incredible landscapes and these plants I’ve never seen anywhere else. I personally wanted to have those at my house. It’s really nice to walk out the door and to be able to see these plants. And like you said, they are thriving.

It’s almost like a lifestyle shift, you’re not just gonna put some plants you bought from the nursery in with some mulch and call it a day. And it’s not a tremendous amount of maintenance, but you are creating an ecosystem. And so you get to reap the benefits of what comes along with that.",https://media.thecurrentla.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/28142028/Matt-Conn-Prairie-Credit-R-Nederveld-2000x1500.jpg,N,,2025-10-28 17:18:50.107949

The Strategic Role of Lithium in North America: 2025 & Beyond

Lithium is an indispensable component of modern battery technology, essential not just to consumer electronics but also to large-scale EVs, energy storage, defense applications, and grid infrastructure. Its light weight and excellent electrochemical properties make it ideal for high-energy density batteries, used in everything from transportation to renewable power backup systems. In 2025 and beyond, the significance of lithium will only surge as we advance towards electrification, sustainability, and security on the continent.

Energy Transition: The continent’s energy supply is rapidly shifting to renewables. Lithium batteries are vital to storing solar and wind energy, ensuring grid stability and flexibility.

Defense Sector: Modern military technology depends on secure supplies of lithium for advanced electronics, communications, and electric vehicles, underpinning national security.

EV Boom: By 2025, rapid expansion of EVs and hybrid vehicles projects exponential lithium demand, locking North America as a critical player in the global supply chain.

Sovereignty & Supply Chain Control: Geopolitical disruptions, trade restrictions, and pandemic lessons make domestic lithium sourcing a strategic imperative, reducing vulnerabilities and dependencies on South American and Chinese sources.

Mine North American Lithium NAL Project Overview: Location, Reserves & Technology

The Mine North American Lithium NAL project, strategically located in Québec, Canada, stands as a flagship undertaking for the continent’s ambitions in sustainable lithium mining. Lithium America—a leading mining company dedicated to responsible extraction—develops and operates NAL as a key asset in North America’s energy future.

Location and Geological Advantage

Location: North American Lithium NAL is based in Québec—Canada’s mineral-rich province, recognized for its strong mining heritage and sustainable regulatory framework.

Reserves: The NAL site boasts significant spodumene deposits—the lithium-bearing mineral of choice—which are among the richest known in the North American region. This abundance translates into sustained, secure supply for years to come.

Analyst firm Global Market Insights (GMI) placed the value of the global gas generator market at $6.9 billion in 2024.
“Data center managers should pay attention to the acoustical performance, reliability, and longevity of any gas generator package they are considering,” said Twardosky.
“Data center managers should look for strong, anti-slip surfaces with chemical resistance to fuels and petroleum products,” Twardosky advised.
Generators for Prime Power Diesel generators have been the norm for backup in data centers for decades.","Backup generators are gaining a new lease on life in data centers. For decades, they have been a rarely used part of the infrastructure, existing for those moments when other power sources fail. But their profile is shifting due to the chronic shortage of available power across North America.

Data center developers have grown impatient with long lead times from utilities, gas turbine original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), and new nuclear generation suppliers. Due to the demand for high reliability and always-on power for artificial intelligence (AI) workloads, some are turning to natural gas generators to provide power more rapidly.

Take the case of the massive data center campus being developed in Millard County, Utah, by Joule Capital Partners, Caterpillar, and CAT dealer Wheeler Machinery that could eventually add up to 4 GW of power. At its heart will sit a fleet of Caterpillar G3520K generator sets (Figure 1) and more than 1 GWh of battery storage. These engines will run on natural gas and be used for prime power. Each one has an engine speed of 1,500 RPM and a power output of 2.5 MW. The system produces electricity and captures waste heat to power and cool high-density AI servers.

“The full generation package can be delivered ahead of most other generation technologies,” said Melissa Busen, senior vice president of Electric Power at Caterpillar. “This speed-to-power advantage is critical for meeting the explosive growth in demand for compute capacity.”

Data Center Construction Boom

Massive data center complexes are becoming the norm due to the pressure to support AI. GW-scale projects are springing up all over North America. According to consulting firm DC Byte, colocation providers and hyperscalers added 12 GW of new capacity in 2024. Thirty-five GW-scale projects were announced in 2024 compared to three the previous year. Another 15 projects broke ground that were slightly below 1 GW in size.

This new breed of AI factories is being situated in places like North Dakota, West Texas, Indiana, Pennsylvania, Kentucky, Kansas City metro, West Virginia, North Carolina, and Alberta, Canada. In North Dakota, for example, Applied Digital found an underutilized wind farm, while in Wonder Valley, Alberta, onsite natural gas generation will power an 8-GW data center with the first 1.5 GW scheduled for completion by 2027. Bring your own power (BYOP) is becoming a necessity for developers—especially when they want to open an AI factory.

Gas Engine Upsurge

The gas engine sector has been healthy for many years. Analyst firm Global Market Insights (GMI) placed the value of the global gas generator market at $6.9 billion in 2024. The projected growth rate is 8.8% per year, reaching $16 billion by 2034. Gas generators beyond 330 kVA are the fastest growing segment. They will exceed $3.5 billion by 2034, at which time machines greater than 750 kVA will account for about a quarter of the total, due to surging data center and AI demand.

The demand for generators has created growth not only for the factories that build the gensets, but also for the companies that package the open-engine generator. Fidelity Manufacturing of Ocala, Florida, for example, is facing an unprecedented era of expansion. The company manufactures custom steel fuel tank sub-bases, and aluminum tube frame enclosures (Figure 2), as well as stairs, platforms, and walkways to supply complete generator packages for engines from Caterpillar, Cummins, Rehlko (formerly Kohler), mtu, Generac, Blue Star, and others.

“We have grown from 40 people to more than 500 in less than a decade, with data center demand for generators being a significant part of that growth,” said Mitch Twardosky, Fidelity’s CEO.

The company has opened a second 86,000-square-foot factory near its original 76,000-square-foot facility to increase capacity. It also has a five-acre asphalt storage area. Another three and a half acres of storage space is under construction, along with a 25,000-square-foot production building and a 25,000-square-foot warehouse.

Advice for Those Specifying Gas Engines

Lead times can be up to one year, or more, to deliver a larger package for a data center. Modern gas engines are available up to about 2.5 MW.

“Data center managers should pay attention to the acoustical performance, reliability, and longevity of any gas generator package they are considering,” said Twardosky.

He recommended choosing an aluminum tube frame with aluminum sheeting over the traditional steel structure due to their strength and rigidity as well as corrosion resistance. Additionally, aluminum designs are much lighter, which aids in transport logistics and ease of installation onsite.

Design is driven by the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) Structural Engineering Institute (SEI) requirements or state/local building codes, depending on the location. These take into account hurricane, earthquake, and weather protection, as well as electrical safety and other essential code points.

Generator packages can include features such as a radiator-mounted load banks, generator output circuit breakers, a neutral ground resistor, LED lighting, plenty of internal and external outlets, as well as power distribution panels, transformers, battery chargers, ventilation fans, emergency stop stations, and space heaters. Most generator manufacturers, added Twardosky, produce the engine/generator and have someone else package it and install it onsite. Fidelity has a service division that installs the packages onsite, both for its own enclosure packages, as well as packages from other vendors. The company is a licensed electrical contractor and a licensed certified building contractor, providing the skills needed for the complex installations.

Stairs, platforms, and walkways are needed for access to an enclosure package. They should never be an afterthought. They should be built in compliance with Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and International Building Code (IBC) standards, composed of an aluminum tube frame decked with molded fiberglass grating in high-visibility yellow.

“Data center managers should look for strong, anti-slip surfaces with chemical resistance to fuels and petroleum products,” Twardosky advised.

Generators for Prime Power

Diesel generators have been the norm for backup in data centers for decades. Diesel is gradually giving way to natural gas as the preferred fuel, and this opens the door to generators transitioning from backup duties to the provision of prime power.

Some utilities are telling data center developers it will be anywhere from three to seven years before they can get more power. Natural gas generators may provide a more immediate solution. They can be installed and used to supply power to operate the entire data center initially and transitioned to backup duty if other sources of power become available.",https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/cat-g3520k-genset.jpg,N,,2025-10-28 17:18:46.233829

Bob Ferguson launched the ZEVergreen initiative via the Department of Ecology in response to President Donald Trump’s cuts in federal funding for electric vehicle rebates.

While the statewide effort is intended to help reduce costs switching to EVs as part of a goal of achieving transportation electrification, some trucking industry stakeholders note that the price tag is only one of several challenge for their businesses.

Aside from a state law that will prohibit the registration of new gasoline-powered vehicles starting in 2035, Washington is also participating in California’s Advanced Clean Trucks program pushing the gradual adoption of electric trucks, which imposes sale percentages for EV trucks.

Although the federal government has sought to remove that power and a lawsuit remains over the matter, there’s been disputes over what is to blame for the trucking industry’s failure to meet sales expectations. In a report published last year, the Electric Vehicle Coordinating Council attributed it to ""market failure,” while a nonprofit representation at a July council meeting said the trucking industry was “taking every single opportunity to undermine the success of the Advanced Clean Trucks regulation.”

Although the cost differences have been noted – $400,000 for an EV truck compared to $150,00 for a diesel truck – Washington Trucking Associations President Sheri Call told Ecology officials at Monday's public session discussing ZEVergreen that while “this initiative is to address affordability ... there still exist operational challenges, and we really don't see that changing with the weight of the trucks that are significantly heavier; so less productive and potentially more vehicles on the road.”

Among those logistical challenges for EV trucks is that they require recharging more frequently than diesel trucks do refueling, and recharging takes considerably longer. Additionally, cold temperatures significantly reduce battery capacity unless the vehicles are stored properly.

Call added that aside from the upfront price of an EV truck, “another issue under the financing and cost challenges is insurability. [I’m] just wondering if that's also kind of analyzed and looked at as we move forward here in our in our planning.”

Ecology Zero Emissions Vehicle Specialist Joshua Grandbouche said that with regard to insurance, “that's not something that we had fully thought through at this point in time, but that that why we're having this call, right?”

Concerning other challenges associated with the use of EV trucks, he said “we are looking longer term at what might address the weight issue and the logistical issues that you come up with zero-motion vehicles. These are just conversations that we've been having with folks and there's a lot of uncertainty. We are looking at different vehicle technologies, such as battery swapping, that would address both logistical problems, as well as weight issues and cost issues technologies that we've been hearing about would be deployable in America, but we do see them deployed in other countries.”

“Longer term, how can we build technologies and solutions that make it much easier to transition the vehicle that aren't as easy to transition today?” he added.

Offering public comment at the public session for ZEVergreen, Washington Policy Center Vice President for Research Todd Myers told Ecology officials that “whatever goals or metrics this program is designed to achieve, that there is a way to assure that those are achieved and what are the standards. Whatever plan you come up with, make sure that you have not just the goals, but a contingency for what happens if you don't meet the goals.”",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/thecentersquare.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/5/41/541086f7-6739-4b20-8c24-d1177b4d0690/68d6b7f4cbf69.image.jpg?crop=1200%2C630%2C0%2C22,N,,2025-10-28 21:59:39.993121

""We need to get more resources on the grid.” Energy legislation is a challenge even in the best of times because it affects everyone from homeowners to large companies.
""The issue of energy capacity has to be addressed in Illinois,"" state Rep. Jay Hoffman, D-Belleville, said today.
Environmental groups say the bill is a needed follow-on to the 2021 law that incentivized renewable-energy development but didn’t address storage.
“ComEd has participated in Senate- and House-sponsored subject matter hearings to speak to certain aspects of the legislation, including energy efficiency,” the company said.","Lawmakers failed to pass an energy bill during the regular spring session. But the latest incarnation of the legislation, called the Clean & Reliable Grid Affordability Act, includes a politically powerful combination of supporters.

“I feel pretty good about it, much better than I did in May,” says state Rep. Ann Williams, D-Chicago, who plans to hold a committee hearing this afternoon, with the goal of moving the bill to the full House tomorrow. ""We need to get more resources on the grid.”

Energy legislation is a challenge even in the best of times because it affects everyone from homeowners to large companies. The new bill is surfacing in Springfield as power prices in Illinois and elsewhere have taken off, fueled by soaring demand from data centers and other users, while the federal government has pivoted away from generous clean-energy and tax-incentive programs that help pay for it.

""The issue of energy capacity has to be addressed in Illinois,"" state Rep. Jay Hoffman, D-Belleville, said today. ""The spikes that we've seen, beginning in June, on customers' bills is unacceptable. We have to act. We're going to act this week. We're going to hopefully pass this bill, the governor's going to sign it and it will go into law June 1st.""

Electricity prices have increased 10% to 15% for Commonwealth Edison customers in Northern Illinois. Downstate, customers of Ameren saw their bills increase about 20% this summer.

Environmental groups say the bill is a needed follow-on to the 2021 law that incentivized renewable-energy development but didn’t address storage. Labor groups see the opportunity for jobs. The Climate Jobs Coalition — which includes 11 unions, ranging from the AFL-CIO to the Illinois Federation of Teachers — agreed last week to support the bill, which includes a project labor agreement that makes it more likely the renewable-energy projects will use local union labor.

“We found that 80% of workers on existing projects we looked at were from out of state,” said Pat Devaney, secretary-treasurer of the AFL-CIO.

The Illinois Manufacturers’ Association is opposed to the legislation, primarily because the cost of building out battery storage, estimated at $7 billion, will be passed along to utility customers across the state. Instead, the group favors using the Illinois Finance Authority to offer below-market financing to fund the projects.

Proponents say much of the construction cost will be covered by sales of the stored energy, and they estimate only about $1 billion will be paid by Illinois utility customers, according to data from the Illinois Power Authority. They say the availability of additional energy stored in the batteries will lower the prices set at auction by regional electrical grid operators that serve Illinois by $13 billion over 20 years, compared with auction prices that could be expected if no storage was added.

The amount of battery storage is half what was proposed in the spring. And a controversial provision that would have required industrial users such as data centers or large manufacturers to supply their own power or pay sharply higher rates has been left out. Williams said the data center issue will be taken up in the spring.

Electricity supplier ComEd hasn’t taken a position on the bill, nor has the Illinois Commerce Commission.

“ComEd has participated in Senate- and House-sponsored subject matter hearings to speak to certain aspects of the legislation, including energy efficiency,” the company said. “We will continue to participate in the process and evaluate our position based on proposed bill language.”

Gov. JB Pritzker, a key proponent of the Climate & Equitable Jobs bill passed in 2021, has urged legislators to lift the state’s ban on large-scale nuclear power plants. Two years ago, the Legislature allowed small, modular reactors, which are still in the development phase. Large nuclear plants cost billions of dollars and can take more than a decade to build.

“I think we ought to lift the ban on nuclear power development in the state,” the governor said two weeks ago at a ribbon-cutting for a 20-acre community solar project in Hampshire.

Since launching its first electric trucks in 2019, Volvo has delivered more than 5,700 electric vehicles across 50 countries, which have collectively driven 250 million kilometers (155 million miles). Volvo Trucks continues to hold a leading position globally and has maintained an average of over 30% market share in the North American electric truck segment over the past five years.

“Reaching this milestone is a testament to our customers’ commitment to sustainable transportation and our dealer network’s dedication to supporting them every step of the way,” said Peter Voorhoeve, president, Volvo Trucks North America. “The path to zero emissions is shaped by market conditions, which are moving slowly. We remain committed to our vision to create a world we want to live in by using zero emissions solutions in combination with fuel efficient combustion engines with reduced climate impact. Solutions that will work for our clients where sustainability meets affordability.”

83 Certified EV dealerships across North America

Since TEC Equipment – Fontana became the first Volvo Trucks Certified EV Dealer in July 2021, the network has expanded rapidly to 83 certified locations across 33 U.S. states and four Canadian provinces. The latest additions bring four new states—Colorado, Louisiana, Maryland, and Nevada—and four new dealer groups into the program. Another 13 locations are currently in the certification pipeline.

Certified dealers complete extensive EV training and invest in facility upgrades to deliver full sales and service support for battery-electric trucks.

Cutting CO₂ Across All Drivelines

Volvo Trucks is advancing cleaner and more efficient solutions across its entire product range. In North America, the all-new Volvo VNL delivers up to 10% better fuel efficiency than its predecessor. For a truck running 120,000 miles per year, that translates to about 1,300 fewer gallons of fuel and a reduction of roughly 30,000 pounds of CO₂.

Fuel-efficient combustion engines that can also run on renewable fuels are one part of Volvo Trucks’ three-path approach to decarbonization—together with battery-electric and fuel-cell electric trucks.

Comprehensive Electric Portfolio Worldwide

Volvo Trucks’ electric vehicles are now operating in 50 countries, with the strongest markets in Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and the United States. Globally, the company offers eight fully electric truck models designed to meet the needs of diverse applications—from urban distribution and waste management to regional haul and construction. These models include the Volvo FL Electric, FE Electric, FM Electric, FM Low Entry, FMX Electric, FH Electric, FH Aero Electric, and the VNR Electric.

How it all started…

Volvo Trucks’ leadership in zero-tailpipe emission transportation began with the launch of the Volvo VNR Electric as part of the pioneering Volvo LIGHTS Project. The $90 million public-private partnership laid the foundation for the widespread adoption of heavy-duty battery-electric trucks by exploring the infrastructure and operational adaptations required to support electromobility. Volvo Trucks is also a key partner in California’s Joint Electric Truck Scaling Initiative (JETSI), which deployed Class 8 battery-electric trucks across Southern California to demonstrate strategies to successfully scale market penetration of zero emission technologies.

Removing barriers “Solar is no longer ‘alternative’ energy,” said Deborah Moore, another Third Act strategist.

This presents problems for people who want to install renewable energy, but whose only guide for how to navigate the process comes from solar companies themselves.
This would help counteract some Trump administration efforts to remove renewable energy incentives, while laying the groundwork for rapid growth of renewables when the national political environment shifts again.","“We have the groundwork in place to make solar power and renewable energy much more accessible than they are now,” celebrated climate activist Bill McKibben told people from all over the country on a Sept. 25 Zoom call.

The virtual gathering was organized by Third Act, a national organization of people over 60 confronting the climate crisis. It took place just days after a Third Act-coordinated nationwide day of action called Sun Day, which saw over 500 events in 49 states draw attention to renewable energy’s vast potential.

At a time when U.S. climate organizations are largely on the defensive, fighting the Trump administration’s rollbacks to climate action at the federal level, McKibben’s words underscored how Third Act has identified a rare opportunity to make real, short-term progress toward a clean energy future. The organization wants to remove local and state-level barriers that prevent people from harnessing the power of the sun.

“This is one area where we don’t have to wait,” said Third Act campaign strategist Jeremy Friedman. “You don’t have to wait for your state legislature to make things better, or for voters to throw out the politicians in Congress who repealed national climate legislation. We don’t have to wait for any policy change coming down from the top before we start taking action.”

Third Act calls its new campaign Simplify Solar. “It’s really more of a project than a single campaign,” Friedman said. “This is a decentralized effort, where volunteers will work at the local level to advance individual campaigns in their own communities.”

If successful, Simplify Solar could show how climate activists can still move the ball forward for clean energy, even at a time of unprecedented attacks on federal progress.

Removing barriers

“Solar is no longer ‘alternative’ energy,” said Deborah Moore, another Third Act strategist. “It’s really the best way to go.”

Solar energy is not only one of the cleanest forms of electricity, it’s also cheaper than energy from fossil fuels in much of the world, including large parts of the United States. Yet, a patchwork of state and local regulations adds time and expense to the process of installing home solar systems in the U.S. Many of these rules constitute unnecessary red tape that prevents people from powering their homes with clean, affordable energy.

By challenging governments to remove these barriers, Third Act activists believe they can help clear a real roadblock to the widespread adoption of clean energy — and there isn’t much the Trump administration can do about it. The organization’s first step is gathering on-the-ground information about current regulations.

Currently, there is no single, publicly accessible database about how different towns, cities and counties handle solar permitting. This presents problems for people who want to install renewable energy, but whose only guide for how to navigate the process comes from solar companies themselves.

“One of the barriers to the uptake of solar is poor information,” said Karen Gladding, a member of the coordinating committee for Third Act D.C. “And where do you go, except to a local installer? And then immediately you’re under pressure to sign a contract.”

This fall, Third Act is organizing a series of virtual trainings to help volunteers learn how to track down information about current policies pertaining to solar in their communities, then crowd source the information into a central database. This will provide a foundation for the next part of the project: persuading governments to remove unnecessary regulations.

“At the outset, we’re not treating city and county officials as targets who necessarily need to be pushed hard,” Friedman said. “Some may be allies waiting in the wings, who are ready to be invited into a partnership by our volunteers. A first step is to see what officials are already willing to work with us.”

Once activists identify where the rules for home solar need to be changed, and which lawmakers are receptive to helping, it will be time to put pressure on those decision makers who are more recalcitrant. This will likely involve some creative activism.

“I call it bureaucracy theater,” Friedman said. “We set up some desks along a sidewalk, complete with stacks of paper and a musty, white-wigged administrator behind the counter. Then, a volunteer playing the part of a beleaguered city resident goes from table to table, trying to get their solar permit approved and getting nowhere.”

Friedman said this kind of street theater is “a way to poke a little fun at the experience of navigating bureaucracy in the modern world.” The message is serious, though: Today, regulations governing rooftop solar aren’t just an inconvenience, but a genuine roadblock to progress on climate change.

“An exciting thing about this work is it’s something people can join from anywhere,” Friedman said. “Unlike so many other campaigns, you can find meaningful ways to participate whether you live in a red, blue or purple state.”

Spanning political divides

“Too often in politics, there’s an overwhelming focus on so-called purple states,” Friedman said. “This leaves people who don’t live in those states without many ways to contribute. Progressives in blue areas assume their state governments are already doing the right thing, while those in red states feel their representatives will never listen to them.”

The issues Simplify Solar seeks to tackle are less straightforward. For example, blue states may have some of the most burdensome regulations holding solar back.

“Up until now, one of the worst states in the country for putting solar on your roof has been New Jersey,” Friedman said. “They actually have more state incentives to make solar cheaper than many other states — but the difficulty of the permitting process makes it so solar is still more expensive in New Jersey than neighboring Pennsylvania. That’s wasted money people are being forced to pay for very little reward.”

A bill passed by the New Jersey legislature this year will help streamline the process for approving home solar installations, assuming it’s signed into law by Gov. Phil Murphy. However, the difficulties solar advocates have encountered there until recently illustrates how barriers to renewables can arise in unlikely places.

Simplify Solar isn’t about complete deregulation.

“We need to ensure solar installations are safe,” Friedman said. “But once that’s taken care of, there doesn’t have to be a lot of additional government intervention.”

Renewable advocates in politically red states can also take action, sometimes at the local level. Red states often contain urban centers where progressive lawmakers may be receptive to climate activists’ message.

How older climate activists helped win the fight over LNG exports

Beyond this, the fact that simplifying solar is about reducing government regulation suggests at least the potential for genuinely bipartisan solutions. This year, Utah — one of the most conservative states in the country — passed a “balcony solar bill,” allowing people to plug small solar systems directly into home electrical outlets without additional fees.

Simplify Solar’s state-level work is entering a quiet period, since most state legislatures meet mainly in the first half of the year. The project will use this time to collect more information about what state regulatory frameworks could most likely be improved.

“Going into January and February, we’ll know a lot more about where legislators are willing and interested in introducing better laws,” Friedman said.

Once state legislative sessions start, Third Act members expect to contact and meet with lawmakers, testify at legislative hearings and engage in more creative kinds of activism. These same types of action will be going on at the local level.

There’s reason to think the organization’s specific volunteer power base might be uniquely suited to push this momentum forward.

Acting now

“Third Actors are especially well positioned for this work, in some ways,” Friedman said. “Our volunteers are more likely to be homeowners than younger people. They’re more likely to have lived in one place for a long time, giving them a relationship with their town and local politics. Those who are retired also likely have flexible daytime hours for interacting with officials.”

Third Act was founded with the goal of marshalling the resources and creativity of people over 60 to tackle climate change. This makes it stand out from other climate groups that have tended to be led by young people, and which in some cases explicitly focus on engaging students.

Young activists will likely always play an important role in the climate movement. But few high school or college students have experience navigating local bureaucracies to make home improvements. Third Act’s volunteers are more likely to be familiar with these processes.

Of course, older people also bring other valuable life experiences to the table. “We have members who are retired city employees, who are former elected officials, and folks who’ve been lawyers,” Friedman says. “Now, they can draw on all those years of experience to inform their activism.”

There are many different ways for volunteers to plug into Third Act’s campaigns. “A lot of how people engage will depend on temperament and ability,” Friedman said. “We’ve got folks with mobility issues, for example, who maybe can’t go testify at City Hall, but who can do research from home on existing local solar policies and share what they find with others.”

If successful, this work will lead to improved accessibility of home renewable energy systems for people all over the United States. This would help counteract some Trump administration efforts to remove renewable energy incentives, while laying the groundwork for rapid growth of renewables when the national political environment shifts again.

“With climate change, of course, we’re up against a real timeline to prevent the crisis from worsening,” Friedman said. “What’s so appealing about this project is it’s an opportunity to cut costs for solar no one wanted to pay — and to do it right now.”",https://wagingnonviolence.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Guilford-Sun-Day.jpg,N,,2025-10-28 16:59:30.626206

LONDON, Oct. 28 (Xinhua) -- China is setting global energy trends by turning its clean energy transition into an engine of industrial renewal, a transformation that benefits the world and opens new ground for China-Britain cooperation, Jack Perry, chairman of The 48 Group, told Xinhua in a recent interview.

China met all of its power demand growth in the first half of 2025 through clean electricity generation, while cutting fossil fuel generation and emissions, said global energy think tank Ember in its Global Electricity Mid-Year Insights.

Remaining the clear frontrunner in global clean energy growth, China accounted for 55 percent of the global increase in solar generation and 82 percent of the rise in wind generation. Its solar power output grew 43 percent year-on-year in the first half of 2025, well above the global average of 31 percent, while its wind generation expanded by 16 percent, more than double the global average, the report showed.

""China's progress in renewable energy is one of the defining transformations of our generation,"" Perry said, noting that behind the numbers lies a strategic, coherent and long-term national vision as the country has taken renewable energy as a foundation for future growth.

Perry also praised China's rapid progress in renewable energy consumption, saying that ""electrification is advancing across every part of life - including transport, housing, manufacturing, and logistics."" He added that such demand continuously drives innovation in renewable integration and energy storage capacity.

According to Ember, China's exports of clean technologies reached a record 20 billion U.S. dollars in August, marking a new high. The think tank said China's clean energy transition is fundamentally reshaping the global energy economy.

""The most powerful outcome of China's clean energy success is that it benefits everyone,"" Perry noted. ""Lower costs, faster deployment, and shared learning are already transforming global markets - and the next stage is about partnership.""

Perry highlighted deepening cooperation between China and Britain in promoting green growth, citing several joint initiatives.

In May 2025, The 48 Group introduced Octopus Energy, a leading British energy supplier, to a group of Chinese partners to explore cooperation in virtual power plants and electric vehicle grid integration.

A month later, Octopus partnered with Chinese automaker BYD to launch Britain's first vehicle-to-grid bundle, offering users ""free charging"" through smart charge-discharge technology and rebates. Octopus has also formed a strategic partnership with one of China's leading wind turbine manufacturers to explore further opportunities in the wind energy sector.

Perry, also chief executive of the London Export Corporation, said Chinese and British counterparts are now building a virtual power plant framework in Beijing that connects solar, wind, electric vehicles, and battery storage through intelligent software systems. The goal is to optimize distributed energy use and create a model that can be replicated internationally.

""The next 10 years will define how nations decarbonize intelligently, and it is here that China-UK cooperation has its greatest potential,"" Perry said.

""The energy transition is not a competition, it is a shared responsibility,"" he added, expressing confidence that the two sides will continue to work together on the defining challenges of this century, including climate change, technology, and sustainable growth. ■",,N,,2025-10-28 16:26:38.796660

Many of these large load interconnection requests from the past 12 months exceed one gigawatt per site.
One concern is whether data centers can “ride through”—or stay connected when the grid experiences voltage or frequency disturbances.
Most data centers are designed to disconnect from the grid during a disturbance to avoid data corruption or loss and switch to backup power.
Addressing the concerns around transmission planning, grid reliability and procedure speed will require a multifaceted approach, Hobbs said.","The “rapid explosion” of large load users looking to connect onto Texas’ electric grid are being built faster than traditional transmission planning can manage, according to the Electricity Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) the state’s grid operator.

Not that long ago, connecting factories and other large commercial facilities to the grid was a matter of predictable demand and growth. The grid had to maintain only a minimal transmission capacity buffer to absorb changes while balancing costs to ratepayers.

But the sheer volume of the energy demand from large data centers, particularly those serving artificial intelligence, require an adjustment of the planning processes to keep the grid reliable, Kristi Hobbs, ERCOT’s vice president of system planning and weatherization, said last week at a Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUC) meeting.

In September 2024, ERCOT was tracking 56 gigawatts in large load interconnection requests. Now, that number has almost quadrupled to 205 gigawatts. Energy experts are quick to point out that requested interconnection is no guarantee that construction will happen—and that 205 gigawatts is a huge number, more than twice as high as ERCOT’s peak demand record of 85.5 gigawatts in August 2023.

Still, ERCOT is tasked with planning transmission and ensuring that they can serve both existing and incoming customers at all times, Hobbs said.

Prior to the explosive growth of data centers to power AI, cloud computing and cryptomines, a jump in power demand from, for example, residential growth, meant the load would be distributed across the state. Texas, the largest state in the mainland United States, now sees a demand that is entirely different.

“When you look at companies that want to come and consume more power than cities in a single location—it’s hard to forecast and plan for that in the future,” Hobbs said of the state’s growing electricity demands.

As a result, ERCOT is looking to grant incoming large energy users a quicker interconnection if they are willing to commit to reducing their power use from the grid during certain grid or transmission conditions. Cooperating with shut-offs would help the grid operator incorporate more large data centers onto the grid while ERCOT works to bridge grid upgrades, and resource and load improvements, Hobbs said

If large load users pledge to curtail their grid power when capacity gets tight, it would give ERCOT more certainty and ability to provide a forecast of how the large loads are going to operate, Hobbs said. Are companies adding their own power, through their own onsite power plant? Or a private power agreement with a utility? Or backup generators?

The grid operator is now tracking 205 gigawatts of large load interconnection requests. More than 70 percent of the 205 gigawatts of current large load interconnection requests are from data centers and another roughly 10 percent are from cryptocurrency mines. It’s a massive jump from 56 gigawatts just over a year ago, according to the latest data from ERCOT.

Many of these large load interconnection requests from the past 12 months exceed one gigawatt per site. It’s the equivalent of each project asking for half of the power produced at the Hoover Dam. Additionally, these data centers want to be connected to the grid fast. Requests from large energy users to be online by 2030—within five years—has risen 227 percent since last year.

“The state wants these large loads here,” PUC chairman Thomas Gleeson said. “We want to hook ‘em and bring them in and have a place for them to go.”

As the growing presence of data centers have reconfigured the state’s energy and grid landscape, there’s tension about the unknown from both the business parties and the regulators. Developers with billion-dollar projects gripe about the changing regulatory landscape and grid planners worry that their role of ensuring reliability is being thwarted by uncertainty around how much energy these projects will actually use and how these facilities will run.

ERCOT is also considering changing its planning procedures with utilities by evaluating multiple proposed projects in a single study.

The current planning system once worked fine. ERCOT and the utilities first agree on a study scope. Then as a large load company signs an agreement with a utility and begins construction, the company’s project becomes part of ERCOT’s planning models and are used in future studies for future loads that want to connect. Once construction wraps up and it’s time to take the final steps to bring the project online, ERCOT and the utility meet again to get a final approval before the large load starts consuming power on the grid.

That process, Hobbs said, was created when there were 40 to 50 large loads on the system that were spread across the state. But with more than 360 interconnection requests now, the planning system could use some renovations, she said.

“We’ve got to look at that so we can reliably connect them,” Hobbs said. The grid operator needs to ensure, before these large loads are connected, that risks have been addressed.

One concern is whether data centers can “ride through”—or stay connected when the grid experiences voltage or frequency disturbances. There are worries that some large load users won’t be able to manage that. Most data centers are designed to disconnect from the grid during a disturbance to avoid data corruption or loss and switch to backup power. But a sudden loss of a large load on the grid could lead to wider outages.

“We need to make sure we have the right requirements in place, and we’re taking the proper precautions to protect their businesses, as well as their neighbors,” Hobbs said.

How to incorporate the list of companies with large loads waiting to get onto the grid and plan for the corresponding transmission will continue to be a topic of discussion both privately and publicly, said Gleeson of the PUC. “We need to figure it out.”

The PUC wants clarity about the requests now in process. Gleeson said one company began the interconnection process in the first quarter of 2024 and was still in limbo, unsure how much longer the approval process would take.

“We have to endeavor to try to give them a little more certainty around what the possible timeline might be,” Gleeson said.

Texas prides itself in its speed around these processes, said Courtney Hjaltman, a PUC commissioner. It wants to continue to say that it’s in one of the fastest regions for interconnection, she said.

Hobbs said building transmission capacity takes time and the study process is a short but important part of it. Addressing the concerns around transmission planning, grid reliability and procedure speed will require a multifaceted approach, Hobbs said.

“I don’t think there’s one solution—there’s no silver bullet,” Hobbs said.",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-1402012537-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-10-28 16:00:58.764910

About Bruce Power","Bruce Power’s Bruce C Project could stand as a cornerstone in Canada’s clean energy future, driving economic growth, creating thousands of high-quality jobs, and reinforcing global leadership in nuclear innovation and medical isotope production.

As highlighted by the Ontario Chamber of Commerce, this project is not just vital for Ontario — it’s a strategic investment in Canada’s energy independence, sustainability, and international influence.

The proposed addition of up to 4,800 megawatts (MW) of energy production through the Bruce C Project, currently undergoing a federal Impact Assessment, would make Bruce Power the largest nuclear generator in the world with a capacity of 12,000 MW.

Interim findings from an upcoming Ontario Chamber report, commissioned by Bruce Power and the Nuclear Innovation Institute, estimate the Bruce C Project would bring with it an estimated 20,000 jobs annually during construction. Over the lifetime of the proposed facility, the project is expected to contribute an annual average of approximately 12,000 full-time equivalent jobs across Canada, and approximately 10,000 of those jobs would be in Ontario.

The Bruce C Project would contribute nearly $200 billion to Canada’s Gross Domestic Product over its lifetime, including $172 billion for Ontario, with tens of billions in tax revenue across all governments.

Bruce Power already is Canada’s largest public-private partnership and its Life Extension Program and Major Component Replacement Project is the country’s biggest privately financed electricity infrastructure project in Canada. Bruce Power’s Life-Extension Program and ongoing operations create and sustain 27,000 direct and indirect jobs annually. The proposed Bruce C would build on this strong foundation, creating new opportunities for skilled employment, economic development, and long-term prosperity for communities across Ontario.

With 95 per cent of Bruce Power’s current spend in Canada through a robust and long-standing made-in-Ontario supply chain, the Bruce C Project would build on Bruce Power’s Canadian at our Core campaign, which hinges on commitments to provide safe, reliable power to Ontario and cancer-fighting medical isotopes globally, drive the economy and strengthen partnerships with Indigenous communities.

“Ontario’s nuclear advantage is powering our future and showcasing the best of Canadian technology, resources, and workers,” said Hon. Stephen Lecce, Ontario Minister of Energy and Mines. “The Bruce C Project will support 50,000 jobs, add $200 billion to the Canadian economy, and expand Ontario’s leadership in life-saving medical isotope production. This is about growing our economy, creating good jobs, and keeping energy affordable for families and future for generations.”

The Bruce C Project and the potential refurbishment of Bruce Power’s Units 1 and 2 would build on the already significant economic contributions of the Bruce Power site ($4-billion in annual economic benefit to the province through operations and Life Extension activities) and contribute to the Province of Ontario’s goal of making Ontario an energy superpower.

“The Bruce C Project marks a pivotal moment in Canada’s clean energy future,” said Lisa Thompson, MPP for Huron-Bruce. “By expanding nuclear capacity right here in Bruce County, we’re not only advancing energy security but also fuelling innovation, job creation, and long-term prosperity across Ontario and beyond.”

“We’re proud of the work we do each and every day at the Bruce Power site and we’re proving that large projects can be completed safely and on plan through our unique public-private partnership,” said James Scongack, Bruce Power’s Chief Operating Officer and Executive Vice-President. “We’re excited about the potential opportunities shown by the Ontario Chamber of Commerce that would benefit everyone in our communities, the province and across the country.”

“Bruce C would contribute to a strong future for Ontario,” said Daniel Tisch,President and Chief Executive Officer, Ontario Chamber of Commerce. “We have the opportunity to build sustainable prosperity for the province’s businesses, workers, and communities through Canadian investment.”

Those benefits would be felt closer to home as well.

“Bruce Power is committed to working hand-in-hand with local residents, Indigenous partners, and municipalities to ensure the benefits of this project are felt where it matters most—right here at home,” said Jessica Linthorne, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Nuclear Innovation Institute, which contributed to the report. “From new jobs to local investments, the proposed Bruce C project would help the Clean Energy Frontier region of Bruce, Grey and Huron counties thrive for generations.”

The final Bruce C Economic Impact Assessment Report will be released by the Ontario Chamber of Commerce in Q1 2026.

A new version of the Future Congress (CF) was held in Maule, an activity in which the local community participated massively, with more than a thousand connected online and over 350 people present at the Maule Regional Theater, interested in learning firsthand about the progress and reflections surrounding the climate crisis affecting the planet, always from a hopeful but critical perspective, while guided by science.

The 2023 CF ""Without Real Limits"" was jointly organized by the Future Challenges Commission of the Senate of the Republic of Chile, the University of Talca, the Autonomous University of Chile, and the Catholic University of Maule.

Rector Carlos Torres Fuschlocher stated that ""universities are involved not only in generating knowledge, but also in transmitting it, and this congress is an example of this. Several universities interact in this effort to communicate science and technology, which are topics of particular importance to all of us. In Maule, in particular, we are addressing topics related to agriculture, such as soil degradation, climate change, and resilience, in addition to contributing to the way we communicate knowledge to provide certainty to the community,"" he expressed.

Senator Ximena Rincón highlighted the collaboration and commitment of the various actors who have made these 12 versions of the event possible.

“Today marks the first year we've been present in all regions of the country, and we're very excited about it. I want to thank the regional universities and the Regional Government for making this meeting possible, as well as the international guests. Discussing climate change in our region is a very necessary topic, as are virtual reality and artificial intelligence, which are urgently needed topics,” he emphasized.

The rector of the UCM, Claudio Rojas Miño, described the current situation on the planet as a climate crisis, calling for continued committed collaboration to counteract its effects on people.

""More than climate change, we are experiencing a climate crisis. I believe we are facing the need for urgent planning actions. What we can do in our humble capacity, but which we are doing on a significant scale, is everything related to research on coastal drylands and agricultural development in the region, precision agriculture, and generating everything related to sustainable development within the university culture.""

The Vice-Rector for Research and Doctoral Programs at the Autonomous University of Chile, Iván Suazo Galdames, emphasized that ""here we are, the three main universities of the Maule region, thinking about the future from an optimistic perspective, rooted in science. In the world, and particularly in this region, we face challenges stemming from the water crisis. If we don't have water, we won't be able to produce the food that humanity needs for the next hundred years, and that is very important, and we have a duty to address it. We gain nothing by improving labor standards for agricultural workers if we won't have arable soils due to a lack of water. As universities, we need to think about how we can grow crops that are less water-intensive and how we optimize agricultural processes so that water is a resource used appropriately,"" he stated.

Boards

At the event, Nobel Peace Prize laureate and World Agriculture Prize winner Rattan Lal addressed the topic ""Soil Health Management and Environmental and Climate Security in Latin America and the Caribbean Region, with Specific Reference to Chile.""

In his presentation, the guest commented that ""it is very important to recognize the concept of healthy soil, plants, animals, the human environment, and planetary processes as an indivisible whole (…). Therefore, in addition to the socioeconomic factor, food security research must also address the problem of managing both desired and unwanted resources. Indeed, agriculture must be a solution for the environment and resources.""

Rattan Lal's call is to return to nature and promote the reuse, recycling, regeneration, and restoration of land, especially marginal land.

“This means innovative agricultural practices such as conservation agriculture, regenerative agriculture, growing ecology, agroforestry, integration of tree crops and livestock practices, positive soil ecosystems, carbon budgeting (…). There are many practices that can be included in regenerative agriculture. And this concept is inspired by Eco-Innovation. It is fueled by known carbon energy and driven by a circular economy and green infrastructure, and supported by recarbonization,” he argued.

In that regard, he stated that ""soil health laws don't exist anywhere, including in the United States, and I hope the next farm bill there will have a provision for a soil health law, to complement the Air Quality Act and the Water Quality and Health Act. That would be a good long-term goal,"" he said.

“The private sector can play a very important role in cooperation with policymakers and academics from universities, research organizations, and international organizations. And, of course, land managers and farmers working together to protect restoration improve soil health.”

By Kathryn Guerra and Adrian Shelley

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency recently announced that it selected Craig Pritzlaff as its next deputy assistant administrator of the Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance. Pritzlaff spent the last five years as the director of enforcement at the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ). The appointment is the latest example of a trend identified by Public Citizen: placing polluter-friendly Texans in high-ranking environmental positions in the Trump Administration.

Under Pritzlaff’s leadership, the TCEQ underwent Sunset review and was described by other state officials as a “reluctant regulator” in a report that also found the agency’s policies lack transparency and generate public mistrust.

Public Citizen’s TCEQ Watchdog campaign has developed numerous critiques of the agency’s enforcement practices. While many of these practices have been in place for much longer than Pritzlaff’s tenure, we hope that new leadership in the agency’s enforcement division will consider how its weak enforcement policies fail to protect communities across Texas.

Allowing polluters to operate without required permits

A polluting facility needs air, water, and/or waste permits issued by the TCEQ or EPA. In Texas, the law requires that facilities obtain permits before construction begins, but it’s not uncommon for the agency to discover that a facility has opened without applying for the required permits.

TCEQ policy has long been to initiate enforcement against facilities that fail to obtain authorization, then draft a legal compliance agreement called an Agreed Order that allows the facility to keep operating, polluting, and profiting. In contrast, the enforcement process drags on, often for a year or more, because the facility must begin the permit application process, which can take up to a year.

In the spring of 2023, the agency responded to a complaint of a concrete batch plant polluting its neighbors in San Antonio. The TCEQ found the facility never applied for the required permits. They were fined $8,750, but two years later, the facility was still doing business without a permit. TCEQ staff had included an ordering provision in the facility’s Agreed Order that legally allowed them to do so. In February 2025, TCEQ leadership suggested that unless the company initiated a new permit application, they might force the company to shut down. As far as we know, that never happened. But the company finally obtained its permit on October 3.

In another recent case, a major petrochemical polluter southwest of Houston was found operating without a required federal air permit. TCEQ fined the company $17,600, but again, a legal agreement between the polluter and the state allowed it to continue operating for more than a year without the necessary permit.

If the average Texan drove a car without a license and got pulled over, they’d face severe penalties. Permits are required by law, and there should be no leniency for companies operating illegally without the required permits. The TCEQ must stop its policy of granting de facto authorization to emit unauthorized pollution, as this directly contradicts state and federal laws that require permits before breaking ground on construction.

Protracted enforcement deadlines that are not strictly enforced

Every Notice of Violation or Enforcement that the agency issues sets a compliance deadline. A polluter must demonstrate they’ve resolved the problem or face additional enforcement action or referral to the Office of the Attorney General for civil action. But most facilities will never face any further consequences for failing to meet compliance deadlines.

Despite the compliance dates incorporated into a legally-binding agreement that the TCEQ itself drafted, the agency often ignores or grants extensions of those deadlines in favor of industry, to the detriment of communities. The agency uses the Executive Director’s discretion to extend any deadline for what it considers “good cause”. The agency says that “the determination of what constitutes good cause rests solely with the Executive Director.”

Compliance deadlines are not immediately imposed once a more serious enforcement-level violation is found. Deadlines are set for 30 to 45 days after a year-long enforcement process, following a polluter’s agreement to the agency’s proposed legal terms to resolve the case, and after the agency’s commissioners vote to approve. TCEQ reported that during fiscal year 2024, the average number of days from the initiation of an enforcement action to its completion was 528 days.

For example, in a case in Bastrop County, a Darling Ingredients meat rendering facility was cited for producing foul odors that have been complained about by communities more than 15 miles away. The agency initiated enforcement action, and in July 2025, the agreed order was approved by the commission. The compliance terms give Darling until January 2026 to implement an odor control plan that would effectively address the odor violation they received in July 2024, while residents continue to suffer. The community has reported more than 350 additional complaints against the facility since the agreed order was approved. Those complaints resulted in five additional violations, but no additional enforcement action. The violations had a compliance deadline of October 15, but that deadline has passed, and the issues still show to be unresolved by the TCEQ. The agency has taken no additional or elevated enforcement action against the facility to date.

Intentionally aggregating violations for months or years

Last month, we began asking questions about an enforcement action set for commissioners’ approval, which spanned ten years and covered nearly 100 violations at an INEOS chemical facility near Houston. Why had TCEQ waited so long to remedy illegal acts? Agency leadership told us that a recently abandoned enforcement policy deliberately allowed violations to accumulate over the years, claiming it was more efficient to handle multiple issues in a single enforcement action. But that proved to be untrue, instead creating a complex backlog of cases that the agency is still struggling to resolve. That’s not efficiency, it’s failure.

More than 20 investigations of the INEOS facility over ten years found illegal acts that the polluter was not legally required to remedy until the passage of the agreed order this year. The delayed action also delayed the required payment of financial penalties. Granted, the fine that was finally issued was quite hefty at nearly $2.25 million, but this amounts to little for a company with $55 billion in annual revenues.

Offering discounts on almost every fine it issues

In the INEOS case, the company was granted a penalty deferral – a discount of nearly $450,000 for what the agency considered an “expedited settlement” of an action that was a decade in the making. The TCEQ’s enforcement policy on penalty calculations also allows polluters to receive discounts for their Compliance History ranking and submitting a letter of intent to conduct an environmental audit.

Along with discounts, TCEQ never issues the most significant fines it can impose. The agency has the authority to fine polluters $25,000 per violation per day, and $40,000 per violation per day in the worst cases. We’re not aware of a maximum fine having ever been issued, even when the facility is cited for the same violation repeatedly. Instead, the agency regularly offers discounts on the paltry fines it does issue. Global corporations worth billions consider these fines the cost of doing business.

The TCEQ’s Compliance History Rating system is a score assigned to come facilities based on their record of past compliance with the law. It is used to justify discounts on fines. To be ranked, the entity must have at least one interaction with the agency. But the agency lacks the staffing resources to investigate the vast majority of facilities in Texas, leaving most facilities with an “unclassified” designation. An “unclassified” ranking is rewarded in the same way as a “satisfactory” ranking facility. 90% of facilities are unclassified, meaning the vast majority of polluters enjoy a perception of fully compliant operation, which is often undeserved. The agency is currently updating its Compliance History rules, but fine discounts are still part of the program.

Companies also have the option of paying up to 50% of a penalty into a supplemental environmental project (SEP). This activity benefits the community by reducing pollution and offering additional advantages.

Supplemental Environmental Projects get approved in communities that didn’t suffer harm.

SEPs are great when they benefit the community that suffered environmental harm. But we’ve found cases of TCEQ approving SEPs in entirely different communities. This summer, the Lyondell Chemical company in Channelview, East Harris County, was allowed to fund a SEP in the whiter, wealthier neighboring community of Barbers Hill. When we asked why this was permitted, we were told it was because there wasn’t a pre-approved SEP in Channelview.

Pre-approved SEPs aren’t the only option. Lyondell Chemical polluted the people of Channelview, and TCEQ regulations allow it to develop a SEP that would benefit them.

That’s just wrong, and it isn’t in the spirit of the SEP program to invest in a different community than the one harmed. TCEQ should enforce this requirement of the SEP program.

Refusing to bring new enforcement actions while others are pending.

Finally, delaying enforcement actions has another consequence: TCEQ won’t bring a new enforcement action for the same illegal activity that is the subject of a pending action during what it considers the “compliance period,” even if the deadline has been arbitrarily extended by agency staff. This means companies are essentially shielded from consequences throughout TCEQ’s protracted enforcement process.

We recently encountered this issue while working with the community in Bastrop County, who are suffering from foul odors from Darling Ingredients. Although the TCEQ was recording the 350 complaints, the agency would not initiate a new enforcement action for nuisance odor because an existing enforcement case remains pending..

Conclusion

The TCEQ has the authority and duty to uphold environmental laws and protect the health of residents in Texas. Communities aren’t unreasonable to ask that the TCEQ’s internal policies reflect a robust enthusiasm to enforce those laws and support the expeditious resolution of violations. But agency leadership has adopted long-standing enforcement policies like these in what community advocates call an effort to shield industry from strict regulation and put profit over people. This practice might explain why Texas regulators are so popular in the current federal administration’s polluter-friendly approach to regulation.

The agency now has an opportunity to bring in fresh leadership that isn’t interested in doing business as usual, but in serving the best interests of Texans and the environment.",https://www.citizen.org/wp-content/uploads/public_citizen_shared_link.jpg,N,,2025-10-28 16:00:05.999165

JB Pritzker joined leaders from Nautilus Solar Energy and Power Sustainable to celebrate the ribbon-cutting of the new Highway 20 Community Solar Farm in Kane County.
Breuer, of Ailey Solar, said while his residential solar sales are expected to drop next year, his commercial solar business has already grown, including among large warehouses and churches.
He expects much of that consumption will still come from renewable energy — including the solar panels his company installs.","By mid-August, RxSun had already stopped taking orders for new home solar installations. After reaching around 500 sales, roughly 100 more than in 2024, representatives with the Chicago-based company said they are now scrambling to finish them by the year’s end.

For other residential solar companies in Chicago and Illinois, the story is much the same.

Demand for home solar installations has surged since the passage of President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill repealing a federal tax credit worth about $8,000 per household by the year’s end. Despite the current sales boom, the repeal is expected to deal a heavy blow to residential solar, with orders projected to plunge starting next year.

“Since July, there’s been a lot of sleepless nights wondering where we are going to end up,” said Chris Gersch, founder and CEO of RxSun. “But the outlook for 2026 is just a fraction of what we did this year.”

Mike Hutchinson, who lives with his family in Naperville, said the thought of installing a solar roof had been on “the back burner” for a number of years — until he heard about the federal tax incentives deadline.

“That kind of lit a fire under me, kind of having to move more quickly, because I had been looking at solar roofs for a while,” said Hutchinson, whose solar panels were installed last week by Windfree Solar.

Gersch estimates a 50% to 70% drop-off in sales in 2026 for RxSun, which primarily services residential solar, making it difficult for the company to pivot into different markets. In the meantime, he said his team will shift its attention to solar batteries and other battery systems. But the losses will be far-reaching, he added.

“I think there’s unfortunately going to be continued job losses in this industry,” Gersch said. “It’s going to be really hard for those businesses to survive, so you’ll see some consolidation.”

Some solar companies say they may expand into other areas of the industry or find different ways to sell panels to consumers to stay afloat.

In recent years, Doug Snower, founder and president of Windfree Solar, has largely credited federal tax incentives — combined with other statewide programs — for some of the Chicago-based company’s most significant growth since its establishment in 2009. Illinois Shines, a state-run solar incentive program, has been a safety net that can help cover up to 40% of the cost of a solar system, he said.

While Windfree Solar also handles large-scale commercial projects, Snower predicts that the company’s 2026 residential sales will drop 50% compared with last year’s average sales.

“We were in just a perfect alignment of all the potential savings for customers to make them move forward,” said Snower, who founded the company by doing small, hands-on solar projects for schools. “Why of all things are they taking those away so people are more incentivized to go back to fossil fuels?”

But Snower said that there’s still a possibility for solar residential customers to benefit from those tax incentives. His company is now switching to a leasing model, where Windfree Solar owns the solar project. This allows the company to claim the federal tax incentives for businesses that own solar panels, which are still temporarily preserved by Trump’s bill, before passing those savings onto the customer.

A similar option is to sign onto a power purchase agreement, in which a third-party company owns the solar panels and passes on tax credits to the customer.

Dorian Breuer, president of Chicago-based Ailey Solar, said despite seeing a recent uptick in solar panel sales, this method hasn’t been embraced by customers.

“Since August, we haven’t had one residential customer move forward with somebody else owning their solar system,” Breuer said. “There’s no question that, in general, solar sales should be down from before, because there are some people, you know, who want to own their car, not lease it. It’s like consumer psychology.”

For some Chicago residents considering solar, the tax credit deadline gave them enough reason to make the switch now.

Hutchinson said he reached out to about five companies and discovered many of them had already cut off additional sales. Others told him it would be a “tight window” to get the installation done by the end of the year, he remembered.

“It was a little bit more frustrating that it had to be so rushed,” Hutchinson said. “Because usually these things are phased out a little bit slowly, and knowing that it would have to be done by the end of the year, I only had probably a four- to six-week window.”

Ben Tolberg, who lives in Forest Park, also had been considering a solar model since his roof was recently renovated about a year ago.

“I always had it in the back of my mind, something I’d like to do someday for environmental sustainability reasons, and all sorts of financial reasons,” Tolberg said. “I thought there was a risk I’d be missing out on something that I thought would be around for years, as far as the incentives.”

After being declined service from a few companies, he reached out to RxSun, which agreed to his request and estimated about a three-month turnaround. Tolberg’s solar panels were installed last week.

This isn’t the first time solar installers in Illinois have faced a hurdle. Before the state passed the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act in 2021 — which provided additional subsidies for solar power projects — many company owners were bracing for a potential severe funding shortage that threatened to force layoffs, relocations or closures.

The end of the federal tax incentives is only one element of Trump’s bill, which strikes at Illinois’ clean energy agenda. The bill also eliminates a tax credit of up to $7,500 for electric vehicle buyers, reduces access to tax credits for solar panel manufacturers, among other measures.

Despite these changes, Illinois appears to be barreling ahead with its clean energy goals.

In early October, Gov. JB Pritzker joined leaders from Nautilus Solar Energy and Power Sustainable to celebrate the ribbon-cutting of the new Highway 20 Community Solar Farm in Kane County. It’s one of the state’s latest ambitious solar projects that will power about 600 low-income households, a park district and a commercial business.

Environmental activists are urging lawmakers to pass the Clean and Reliable Grid Affordability Act, aimed at expanding the state’s electricity grid. The General Assembly failed to pass the bill earlier this year and is expected to vote on it in the fall veto session, which concludes Thursday.

Under CEJA, one of Pritzker’s signature achievements, the state has set a goal of reaching 40% renewable energy by 2030. Last year, renewable energy accounted for just over 15% of electricity generation in the state, according to the Illinois Power Agency. The law also targets 100% carbon-free electricity by 2045.

Breuer, of Ailey Solar, said while his residential solar sales are expected to drop next year, his commercial solar business has already grown, including among large warehouses and churches.

And that growth, Breur said, comes as Illinois’ demand for electricity is still projected to rise, driven by the creation of new data centers and more electrical vehicle usage. He expects much of that consumption will still come from renewable energy — including the solar panels his company installs.

“In Illinois and elsewhere, coincidentally, a trend happening at exactly the same time as this crackdown on renewable energy is the spike in electrical demand from several major sectors,” Breur said. “That demand is rising, and the largest sources of new generation have tended not to be fossil fuels, but solar and wind.”",https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ctc-l-solar-roofs012_245408156.jpg?w=1024&h=683,N,,2025-10-28 16:26:03.999108

(NYSE: NEE) and Google have announced a landmark agreement to restart the Duane Arnold Energy Center in Iowa—the state’s only nuclear facility—to help meet soaring U.S. electricity demand driven by artificial intelligence (AI) and data center growth. The 615-MW plant, located near Cedar Rapids, is scheduled to return to full operation by the first quarter of 2029, pending regulatory approval.

Under the 25-year agreement, Google will purchase a significant portion of the plant’s output as a 24/7 carbon-free energy source to power its cloud and AI infrastructure. The remaining capacity will be bought by Central Iowa Power Cooperative (CIPCO) on equivalent terms. NextEra Energy will assume full ownership of the facility after acquiring CIPCO and Corn Belt Power Cooperative’s combined 30% stake.

The Duane Arnold restart—shut down in 2020 after nearly five decades of service—marks a major return of nuclear generation to Iowa and underscores the growing convergence between Big Tech and clean baseload power. NextEra said the project will create around 400 permanent jobs and generate more than $9 billion in total economic benefits for Iowa, including $3 million annually in new tax revenue.

“This partnership with Google not only brings nuclear energy back to Iowa—it accelerates the development of next-generation nuclear technology,” said NextEra CEO John Ketchum, highlighting the collaboration’s role in strengthening U.S. grid reliability and advancing national energy independence.

Google, which has invested more than $7 billion in Iowa since 2007, framed the deal as essential to its AI-driven growth strategy. “Reopening Duane Arnold delivers reliable, clean power and hundreds of new jobs in the Hawkeye State,” said Ruth Porat, president and CFO of Alphabet and Google, calling it a model for similar clean energy investments across the country.

The companies also announced a strategic agreement to explore new nuclear generation projects nationwide, positioning nuclear power as a cornerstone of the AI and data economy. This comes amid growing concern that U.S. electricity demand—expected to rise sharply through 2035 due to AI, electrification, and manufacturing—will outpace renewable and grid expansion without firm, low-carbon generation sources.

Iowa officials hailed the move as a major milestone in the state’s energy evolution. Governor Kim Reynolds praised the project as “a fusion of nuclear and AI innovation that will drive economic growth, strengthen communities, and keep America competitive.”

Economic studies suggest that the restart will add over 1,600 jobs during construction, with $340 million in annual output statewide once operational. In Linn County, where the plant is located, the project is expected to sustain 400 high-paying, full-time positions and generate $127 million in long-term local earnings.

The Duane Arnold revival follows comprehensive engineering evaluations and coordination with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). NextEra Energy emphasized that the restart will not raise costs for Iowa ratepayers, as Google’s long-term power purchase agreement (PPA) covers all production expenses.

The announcement further deepens NextEra and Google’s long-standing energy partnership, which already spans nearly 3 GW of clean energy projects across the U.S., including wind, solar, and battery assets.

The deal also signals a broader renaissance for U.S. nuclear power, as utilities and tech giants alike revisit the technology’s potential to provide round-the-clock carbon-free power amid tightening climate goals and unprecedented data center growth.

In a letter sent by CEO Sam Altman to the White House's Office of Science and Technology Policy on Monday, OpenAI called its $500 billion Stargate project, which is a chain of AI data centers now under construction in Texas, New Mexico, Ohio, and Wisconsin, a ""once-in-a-century opportunity"" to reindustrialize the US economy.

The company also projects that a $1 trillion investment in AI infrastructure could result in more than 5% in additional GDP growth over three years.

To make the ongoing data center buildout a success, it might take one-fifth of the nation's existing skilled trade workforce, as well as for the US to add 100 gigawatts of energy production capacity a year.

""The country will need many more electricians, mechanics, metal and ironworkers, carpenters, plumbers, and other construction trade workers than we currently have,"" the letter said, adding that OpenAI plans to create new training pipelines through a ""Certifications and Jobs Platform"" starting in 2026.

In the letter, OpenAI also warned of an ""electron gap"" between the US and China and wrote that limited domestic electricity generation threatens both America's AI competitiveness and national security. According to figures cited by OpenAI, while China added 429 gigawatts of new power capacity in 2024, the US only added 51 gigawatts.

The energy bottleneck is becoming an issue for AI companies seeking to build data centers, and so is the pushback. This summer, new AI centers popping up across the country have drawn the ire of local residents for driving up household electricity bills in at least 13 states. As major utilities companies plan multibillion-dollar infrastructure projects to build more energy-generating capacity, there is little regulation to prevent companies from recovering those costs from a utility's entire customer base.

A Business Insider investigation earlier this year also found that annual public health costs from electricity generation for data centers could reach between $5.7 billion and $9.2 billion. This is mainly because the US relies on highly polluting fossil-fuel-fired sources for at least 60% of its electricity, which has health implications for residents in the region.

They address a wide array of issues from renewable energy to elections to criminal justice.

Here is a breakdown of more key laws set to take effect next month.

Tax cuts are coming

One of the big victories for lawmakers this session was securing income tax cuts, a goal long championed by the Republican supermajority in the legislature and Gov. Kevin Stitt.

House Bill 2764 sets the top income tax rate at 4.5% for individuals earning more than $2,300 each month or married couples earning more than $7,500. It's the quarter-percentage-point cut Stitt managed to work out with Republicans in the legislature earlier this year, despite some expressing concerns about induced state revenue cuts amid rising inflation.The law reduces all the state income tax rates by one-quarter of a percent and eliminates the three lowest brackets, all while establishing a system for further reductions in income tax rates based on revenue estimates.

Legislative fiscal reports estimate the tax reduction will cost the state $357 million annually by Fiscal Year 2028.

Oklahoma cracks down on driving under the influence

Oklahoma drivers will face more serious charges for certain DUIs under Senate Bill 54. Previously, a first DUI offense was a misdemeanor, and subsequent DUIs were felonies. Now, people who are arrested for “aggravated” DUIs will be charged with a felony, even if it’s their first offense.

There are a few different ways a DUI can be classified as “aggravated.” One is driving under the influence “in a careless or wanton manner without regard for the safety of persons or property.” And if a driver has a breath alcohol content higher than 0.15, they can be charged with a felony DUI for going the wrong way on a one-way street, speeding more than 20 miles per hour over the limit or getting in an accident.

People who already have a DUI on their records will also receive a harsher sentence if caught driving drunk again. According to House Bill 1222, people arrested for a second or subsequent DUI must appear before a judge and be assigned bail.

Renewable energy and manufacturing changes

Manufacturers of small wind turbines can now count on paying more taxes for building in Oklahoma. House Bill 1205 by Durant Republicans Rep. Cody Maynard and Sen. David Bullard repeals the tax credit for manufacturing the renewable energy machines that rely on wind to generate electricity.

The credit has been in place for almost a decade and was initially meant to encourage the construction of energy grids with lower pollution and emissions than traditional fossil fuels like oil and natural gas, while also benefiting rural communities with extra income from leasing private land for wind turbines.Relatedly, lawmakers approved House Bill 2752, by Republicans Rep. Trey Caldwell from Faxon and Sen. Todd Gollihare from Bristow, which limits renewable energy project investors from using eminent domain to build on private land, whether they’re wind turbines, hydroelectric power plants or solar farms.

Other measures establish standards and procedures for decommissioning solar farms once they’re no longer in use, and eliminate requirements for cities and counties to implement energy- and cost-saving measures in government buildings.

State tweaks competency restoration process amid turmoil

Any time period where a defendant refuses prescribed or court-ordered medication cannot be counted toward their competency restoration treatment.

Senate Bill 1089, which passed on veto override, amends existing state law about mental health treatment for criminal defendants who are too mentally unwell to move through the trial process. The change addresses a facet of Oklahoma’s fraught competency restoration process, which the Department of Mental Health has been legally mandated to reform.

Previously, a person deemed incompetent to stand trial could receive services for up to two years. The new law allows longer treatment if a person refuses medication intended to restore competency. The change comes amid questions about the quality of care at the Oklahoma Forensic Center, after a man accused of killing a police officer and injuring another met the treatment deadline without improvement.

Sentencing reform changes

A number of criminal justice reforms are set to take effect this November, giving incarcerated Oklahomans a better chance to land on their feet.

House Bill 1460 removes several fees for people moving through the justice system and strengthens the court fee waiver process. Gov. Stitt highlighted the need to reduce costs associated with incarceration during his State of the State address in February, saying outstanding debts can cripple people after they get out from behind bars.

The bill eliminated six fees, some of which had collection rates as low as 25% and cost the state more than they brought in. People who can’t keep pace with fines and fees may face driver’s license suspension, re-arrest or even more jail time, further entrenching them in the cycle of incarceration. House Bill 1462 also reforms payment structures, directing courts to prioritize restitution payments to victims over other fees.

House Bill 2364 helps ensure people leaving prison have a driver’s license, birth certificate and Social Security card. Another measure, Senate Bill 216, keeps people’s driver’s licenses from expiring while they are incarcerated.

Another change to state law, Senate Bill 690, will allow people serving time in county jails to earn credit for good behavior. Credits can be applied toward early release, as in Oklahoma’s state prisons.

Lauria and Ashley’s Law has been proposed each of the last three years, though it finally became law this year via House Bill 1001. It requires that anyone who is an accessory to murder serve at least 85% of their prison sentence before being considered for parole.

The law is named for Welch teenagers Lauria Bible and Ashley Freeman, who were kidnapped and killed in 1999. Only one person, Ronnie Busick, was arrested in relation the crime. He received a ten-year sentence as an accessory to murder but was released after three years in prison.

Health care changes

Oklahomans can now count on fewer trips to the pharmacy to obtain contraceptives, thanks to legislation authored by Sen. Jo Anna Dossett, D-Tulsa, and Rep. Cynthia Roe, R-Lindsay. Senate Bill 176 requires health benefit plans to offer coverage for a three-month supply the first time an enrollee obtains a contraceptive drug and a six-month supply each subsequent time.

House Bill 2298 by House Speaker Kyle Hilbert, R-Bristow, and Senate Pro Tem. Lonnie Paxton, R-Tuttle, allows certified nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists or certified nurse midwives to prescribe independently of a physician. They must complete a minimum of 6,240 supervised clinical practice hours and apply to the Oklahoma Board of Nursing for this authority.

Professionals will be allowed to administer Schedule III, IV and V controlled dangerous substances, which include things like anabolic steroids, Ambien and Xanax. Supporters argue this will help expand access to care in rural communities.

Senate Bill 889, by Sen. Casey Murdock, R-Felt, and Rep. Mark Lepak, R-Claremore, requires hospitals to publish a list of prices for 300 common services in an easy-to-understand manner. That includes things like a simple description of the service, its billing code, discounted cash price and negotiated insurance rates. The State Department of Health may monitor hospital compliance.

Lawmakers tweak ballot collection process, reduce number of elections

Oklahoma officials will soon be making some changes to the ballot box.

Multiple laws passed last session have altered Oklahoma’s election processes. Perhaps the most controversial is Senate Bill 1027, which sets limits on the number of signatures that can come from residents of any given county in the initiative petition process. These restrictions are tied to the number of ballots cast in the previous gubernatorial election; for a statutory petition, no more than 11.5% of that number can count toward the petition, and for a constitutional amendment, it rises to 20.8%.

The law is already the subject of legal challenges, with one disputing its constitutionality.

Nearly 20% of the state’s population lives in Oklahoma County, and another 17% lives in Tulsa County.

Senate Bill 147 continues discussions of election security that made headlines during the 2020 presidential election. The law requires county election board secretaries to conduct audits following certain elections, such as the general election, primary elections and run-off primary elections.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9c31c35/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3150+0+425/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F60%2F3d%2F877e430b499fa13f7cce780fd03a%2Finsidecapdome4dslr.jpg,N,,2025-10-28 17:18:42.746050

That includes investments in grid modernization, energy storage and efforts to protect communities from outages during extreme weather and cyberattacks. Ending these projects leaves Americans vulnerable to more frequent and longer-lasting power outages.

The Department of Energy has defended the cancellations, saying that “the projects did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs, were not economically viable and would not provide a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars.” Yet before any funds are actually released through these programs, each grant must pass evaluations based on the department’s standards. Those included rigorous assessments of technical merits, potential risks and cost-benefit analyses — all designed to ensure alignment with national energy priorities and responsible stewardship of public funds.

I am an associate professor studying sustainability, with over 15 years of experience in energy systems reliability and resilience. In the past, I also served as a Department of Energy program manager focused on grid resilience. I know that many of these canceled grants were foundational investments in the science and infrastructure necessary to keep the lights on, especially when the grid is under stress.

The dollar-value estimates vary, and some of the money has already been spent. A list of canceled projects maintained by energy analysis company Yardsale totals about US$5 billion. An Oct. 2, 2025, announcement from the department touts $7.5 billion in cuts to 321 awards across 223 projects. Additional documents leaked to Politico reportedly identified additional awards under review. Some media reports suggest the full value of at-risk commitments may reach $24 billion — a figure that has not been publicly confirmed or refuted by the Trump administration.

These were not speculative ventures. And some of them were competitively awarded projects that the department funded specifically to enhance grid efficiency, reliability and resilience.

Grid improvement funding

For years, the federal government has been criticized for investing too little in the nation’s electricity grid. The long-term planning — and spending — required to ensure the grid reliably serves the public often falls victim to short-term political cycles and shifting priorities across both parties.

But these recent cuts come amid increasingly frequent extreme weather, increased cybersecurity threats to the systems that keep the lights on, and aging grid equipment that is nearing the end of its life.

These projects sought to make the grid more reliable so it can withstand storms, hackers, accidents and other problems.

National laboratories

In addition to those project cancellations, President Donald Trump’s proposed budget for 2026 contains deep cuts to the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, a primary funding source for several national laboratories, including the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, which may face widespread layoffs.

Among other work, these labs conduct fundamental grid-related research like developing and testing ways to send more electricity over existing power lines, creating computational models to simulate how the U.S. grid responds to extreme weather or cyberattacks, and analyzing real-time operational data to identify vulnerabilities and enhance reliability.

These efforts are necessary to design, operate and manage the grid, and to figure out how best to integrate new technologies.

Grid resilience and modernization

Some of the projects that have lost funding sought to upgrade grid management – including improved sensing of real-time voltage and frequency changes in the electricity sent to homes and businesses.

That program, the Grid Resilience and Innovation Partnerships Program, also funded efforts to automate grid operations, allowing faster response to outages or changes in output from power plants. It also supported developing microgrids – localized systems that can operate independently during outages. The canceled projects in that program, estimated to total $724.6 million, were in 24 states.

For example, a $19.5 million project in the Upper Midwest would have installed smart sensors and software to detect overloaded power lines or equipment failures, helping people respond faster to outages and prevent blackouts.

A $50 million project in California would have boosted the capacity of existing subtransmission lines, improving power stability and grid flexibility by installing a smart substation, without needing new transmission corridors.

Microgrid projects in New York, New Mexico and Hawaii would have kept essential services running during disasters, cyberattacks and planned power outages.

Another canceled project included $11 million to help utilities in 12 states use electric school buses as backup batteries, delivering power during emergencies and peak demand, like on hot summer days.

Several transmission projects were also canceled, including a $464 million effort in the Midwest to coordinate multiple grid connections from new generation sites.

Long-duration energy storage

The grid must meet demand at all times, even when wind and solar generation is low or when extreme weather downs power lines. A key element of that stability involves storing massive amounts of electricity for when it’s needed.

One canceled project would have spent $70 million turning retired coal plants in Minnesota and Colorado into buildings holding iron-air batteries capable of powering several thousand homes for as many as four days.

Rural and remote energy systems

Another terminated program sought to help people who live in rural or remote places, who are often served by just one or two power lines rather than a grid that can reroute power around an interruption.

A $30 million small-scale bioenergy project would have helped three rural California communities convert forest and agricultural waste into electricity.

Not all of the terminated initiatives were explicitly designed for resilience. Some would have strengthened grid stability as a byproduct of their main goals. The rollback of $1.2 billion in hydrogen hub investments, for example, undermines projects that would have paired industrial decarbonization with large-scale energy storage to balance renewable power. Similarly, several canceled industrial modernization projects, such as hybrid electric furnaces and low-carbon cement plants, were structured to manage power demand and integrate clean energy, to improve grid stability and flexibility.

The reliability paradox

The administration has said that these cuts will save money. In practice, however, they shift spending from prevention of extended outages to recovery from them.

Without advances in technology and equipment, grid operators face more frequent outages, longer restoration times and rising maintenance costs. Without investment in systems that can withstand storms or hackers, taxpayers and ratepayers will ultimately bear the costs of repairing the damage.

Some of the projects now on hold were intended to allow hospitals, schools and emergency centers to reduce blackout risks and speed power restoration. These are essential reliability and public safety functions, not partisan initiatives.

Canceling programs to improve the grid leaves utilities and their customers dependent on emergency stopgaps — diesel generators, rolling blackouts and reactive maintenance — instead of forward-looking solutions.",https://images.theconversation.com/files/697335/original/file-20251020-79-qldut1.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C422%2C3998%2C1999&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,N,,2025-10-28 15:00:45.076620

The coordinated legal challenges mark an escalation in the fight over how aggressively regulators enforce air-pollution standards along Louisiana’s industrial corridor.

Federal Emissions Rollbacks Face Local Resistance

The latest lawsuit targets a decision by President Donald Trump and the EPA granting chemical manufacturers a two-year reprieve from complying with a 2024 emissions rule intended to cut toxic air pollutants and lower cancer risks. Filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, the case argues that the delay unlawfully allows companies to continue polluting and puts nearby residents at heightened risk.

Twelve chemical facilities across Louisiana, from New Orleans and Baton Rouge to Lake Charles, received exemptions under Trump’s July proclamation delaying enforcement of the EPA’s Hazardous Organic NESHAP, or HON Rule, which targets emissions of ethylene oxide and chloroprene, both linked to cancer. The affected operators include Shell, BASF, Dow, Denka, Sasol and Westlake.

The plaintiffs are RISE St. James, Concerned Citizens of St. John and the Louisiana Environmental Action Network, represented by Earthjustice, along with community groups in Texas and national organizations such as the Sierra Club. They argue that the exemptions weaken oversight and undermine public health protections in areas already burdened by industrial emissions.

Industry leaders say the delay is necessary to prevent costly shutdowns and supply-chain disruptions. “Without these exemptions, the current regulations do not provide a realistic timeline for compliance,” said Louisiana Chemical Association CEO David Cresson, arguing that the decision helps safeguard local jobs and economic stability.

Critics argue that the administration’s defense of the emissions-rule exemptions as a jobs measure rings hollow given its broader rollback of renewable-energy initiatives and the hundreds of thousands of clean-energy jobs it is projected to eliminate. When President Trump signed the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” it significantly restricted or phased out key federal tax credits for wind, solar and battery projects by tightening deadlines and accelerating phase-out schedules.

In Louisiana, Governor Jeff Landry signed Act 462, reclassifying natural gas as a “green energy” source which environmentalists say redirects resources away from clean-energy development. Advocates contend that if economic growth and employment were truly the priority, state and federal governments would be expanding such projects as part of an all-of-the-above approach to addressing energy needs, not undermining renewable-energy opportunities.

“We really can’t wait,” said Shamell Lavigne, chief operating officer of RISE St. James. “We have family members in all of the parishes throughout Cancer Alley.” The EPA has estimated that enforcing the HON Rule could reduce cancer risks by as much as 96% for people living within six miles of large chemical plants.

A Growing Wave of Environmental Lawsuits Across Louisiana

The Trump-era exemption case is part of a broader surge of litigation testing Louisiana’s balance between industrial growth and environmental protection.

In May, a coalition of grassroots organizations filed a federal lawsuit challenging a 2024 state law that restricts independent air monitoring by local groups in industrial zones. The law, which threatens fines of up to $32,500 per day for unpermitted monitoring, has been criticized as an “industry-friendly ban” that blocks communities from documenting air-quality violations. Plaintiffs include RISE St. James, The Descendants Project, and Concerned Citizens of St. John.

A separate case in August saw environmental organizations, led by the Environmental Integrity Project, file a suit to revoke a Clean Air Act permit for the CP2 LNG export terminal in Cameron Parish. The plaintiffs argue state regulators failed to fully evaluate the facility’s air impacts before approving construction.

In October, another Louisiana court struck down a permit for the proposed Commonwealth LNG terminal, marking a rare win for environmental advocates seeking to slow the expansion of liquefied natural gas infrastructure along the Gulf Coast.

These disputes come on the heels of a federal appellate court’s April decision reviving a civil rights lawsuit alleging St. James Parish has engaged in discriminatory land-use practices by approving petrochemical sites in predominantly Black communities. The plaintiffs, which include RISE St. James, Inclusive Louisiana, and Mount Triumph Baptist Church, argue that decades of zoning and permitting decisions have concentrated heavy industry in areas already suffering from poor air quality and high cancer risk.",https://assets-bizneworleans-com.s3.amazonaws.com/2025/10/Louisiana-Groups-Lead-Push-Against-EPA-Emissions-Rollbacks-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-10-28 16:01:06.546574

The United States Sodium-ion Battery Market is expected to grow substantially, increasing from US$ 55.32 million in 2024 to US$ 113.77 million by 2033. This indicates a strong Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 8.34% between 2025 and 2033.

The growth is fueled by rising demand for energy storage solutions, technological advancements in batteries, and the transition towards sustainable forms of energy, making sodium-ion batteries an integral part of the future energy mix. California, New York, and Washington lead adoption through renewable integration, grid modernization, and clean energy initiatives.

One of the most prominent benefits of sodium-ion batteries is the widely available nature of sodium, hence they present a more cost-friendly and sustainable option, especially with increasing global demand for energy storage systems.

In the United States, sodium-ion batteries are increasingly being considered for different applications, particularly in grid energy storage systems, where they can assist in stabilizing energy supply from renewable energy sources such as wind and solar. Their possible application in electric cars is also being studied, with the goal of giving a cost-effective alternative to improve battery technology. Sodium-ion batteries could also be used in consumer devices and backup power systems, increasing the versatility and availability of energy storage solutions in various industries.

Growth Driver in United States Sodium-ion Battery Market

Ample Raw Material Availability

Sodium-ion batteries are picking up momentum in the U.S. because sodium is considerably more plentiful and less geographically localized than lithium. In contrast to lithium, which is heavily dependent on imports and mining concentrated in a small number of countries, sodium is readily available through seawater and domestic mineral deposits. This availability eliminates supply chain risks, reduces cost volatility, and facilitates large-scale deployment. For American energy storage projects, price competitiveness being as important as it is, sodium-ion batteries offer a sustainable option.

With the U.S. government looking to wean itself from its reliance on imported critical minerals, energy storage based on sodium provides a strategic benefit for both energy security and scalability in the long term. August 2024, Natron Energy was planning to construct the first large-scale US sodium-ion battery factory, a $1.4 billion North Carolina plant. It will churn out 24 GWh of batteries a year, which is 40 times the size of the Michigan plant that just went into operation.

Grid-Scale Energy Storage Demand

America is fast developing renewable energy infrastructure, most notably solar and wind. They are intermittent and need cheap and reliable energy storage systems to match supply with demand. Sodium-ion batteries, with their encouraging cycle life, safety features, and ability to withstand broader temperature ranges, are ideal for stationary applications. Utilities and grid operators are tapping into sodium-ion technologies to stabilize the grid, cut peak demand strain, and achieve resilience.

Sodium-ion batteries are safer with less likelihood of thermal runaway compared to lithium-ion, and this makes them more suitable for large-scale storage facilities located close to populated areas. Their application in renewable integration will be one of the key drivers of growth. August 2025, Peak Energy announced its first sodium-ion battery energy storage system (BESS), now shipped for a pilot program with nine utilities and IPPs. The firm states that it is the largest sodium-ion phosphate pyrophosphate (NFPP) battery system in the world and the first US grid-scale sodium-ion storage solution to be deployed.

Sustainability and Recycling Advantages

Sodium-ion batteries meet increasing U.S. sustainability objectives by providing smaller environmental footprint than lithium-ion technologies. Sodium is not toxic, abundant, and less difficult to process, ending dependence on environmentally rigorous mining procedures. The less complex chemistry of sodium-ion cells facilitates more direct recycling processes, enabling the circular economy. As federal and state policy spur more environmentally friendly technologies, sodium-ion batteries are showing promise as an environmentally friendly option for both grid storage and mobility.

Businesses and policymakers see their potential to lower carbon emissions in both the energy and automotive industries, and so sustainability is an increasingly potent enforcer of adoption. July 2025, Inlyte Energy will install an innovative iron-sodium battery at Alliance Redwoods Conference Grounds in Sonoma County, CA, to increase wildfire resilience, reduce electricity expenses, and offer a diesel-free backup power solution. Funded with a $4.1 million grant from the U.S. Department of Energy's Critical Facility Energy Resilience program, the effort will also be performance validated with partners Electric Power Research Institute and Pacific Northwest National Laboratories.

Challenge in United States Sodium-ion Battery Market

Lower Energy Density than Lithium-ion

One major challenge facing sodium-ion batteries in the U.S. is that they possess lower energy density than their lithium-ion equivalents. This restricts their use for applications demanding compact, lightweight, high-energy storage, like long-range electric vehicles. Though sodium-ion competes in stationary storage and short-range mobility, it is not yet able to satisfy the performance requirements of mass-market automotive consumers.

This disparity hampers commercialization since investments in R&D are still necessary to optimize electrode materials and increase overall efficiency. Overcoming this technical hurdle is critical for sodium-ion to directly compete with incumbent lithium-ion technologies.

Limited Commercial Infrastructure and Ecosystem

The American sodium-ion battery market is still in its infancy, with few large-scale manufacturing facilities, supply chains, and supporting ecosystems. The majority of production resides in pilot projects or research partnerships. This immature infrastructure results in higher upfront costs and limits market adoption.

Secondly, the sodium-ion battery has to contend with strong competition from lithium-ion, which already enjoys economies of scale, established OEM relationships, and wide distribution channels. This barrier must be overcome through high investment in pilot-to-commercial scale production, collaboration with automakers and utilities in cooperation with the federal government to drive market readiness.

,Congress,2025-10-28 18:25:25+00:00,House Committee on Appropriations - Republicans,300+ Stakeholders Support Clean CR to Reopen Government,Not Available,,,,,https://appropriations.house.gov/news/press-releases/300-stakeholders-support-clean-cr-reopen-government,"It’s time to pass a clean continuing resolution and end this shutdown today.
The path forward for Congress is clear: Reopen the government immediately under a clean continuing resolution that allows continued debate on larger issues.
We urge Congress to pass a clean continuing resolution to reopen the government immediately.
Moms for America: Moms for America is calling on the United States Senate to immediately pass the CLEAN Continuing Resolution to reopen the federal government.
The call to action is clear: Democrats must reopen the government through the passage of the clean continuing resolution.","Washington, DC – Bipartisan majorities in both chambers of Congress have voted in support of a clean, nonpartisan CR to reopen the government and fund it through November 21, giving Appropriators time to continue the appropriations process and advance a first slate of full-year funding bills through the conference committee process. Senate Democrats continue to block that legislation, forcing federal employees to work without pay and limiting the services available to the American people.

The clean, nonpartisan funding extension, led by Chairman Tom Cole(link is external), is the responsible approach and has earned the support of more than 300 organizations, with hundreds of letters and statements of support. Recent statements from the American Federation of Government Employees(link is external) and New York City's Steamfitters Local 638(link is external) urge immediate action on our bill to reopen the government and pay federal workers. These organizations join hundreds of industry groups across agriculture, transportation, veteran support, construction, real estate, health care, business, hospitality, education, and more in support of a clean CR.

The message is clear: no one wins in a shutdown. The damage to the American people grows exponentially with every day the shutdown continues.

This key stakeholder support proves that Democrats’ continued effort to block passage of the clean CR is out of step with the American people, who demand and deserve an open and functional federal government. The full list of organizations supporting H.R. 5371, the Continuing Appropriations and Extensions Act, 2026(link is external), can be found here(link is external). Read on for some key highlights.

1792 Exchange: Shutting down the government is bad for business. Slowing down the economy’s momentum is bad for America. The CR is a good solution for today as we continue to work to build a solid foundation for our country’s future prosperity.

Aerospace Industries Association: AIA urges Congress to pass a continuing resolution, free of extraneous legislation, to keep key agencies of the U.S. government funded and open. Without a continuing resolution, the innovation and development necessary to protect national security and maintain functionality of air travel will be halted, causing serious disruptions.

Agriculture Industry: A government shutdown affects all American families and has significant consequences on farmers, ranchers, growers, and all who work to grow, process, deliver, and prepare the food our nation relies on… A government shutdown adds additional uncertainty, disrupts critical services, delays payments, and places more burden on rural communities already feeling significant stress.

Airlines for America: Missed paychecks for the federal employees charged with the safe and efficient facilitation of our national airspace unnecessarily increases stress for the thousands of air traffic controllers, TSA officers, and CBP employees who work every day to keep aviation safe and secure. Aviation remains the safest mode of transportation in the world — but to maintain that record, a system under stress must slow down, reducing efficiency and causing delays for travelers and shippers. We urge elected leaders to act with an appropriate sense of urgency to solve this problem and immediately reopen the federal government. The quickest and simplest way to ensure those critical employees are paid is by passing a clean CR.

Airline Pilots Association, International: Airline pilots stand in solidarity with our brothers and sisters at NATCA and with all the federal workers who are continuing to work without a paycheck during this shutdown. The job of keeping aviation safe and secure is tough on an easy day, but forcing them to do it without pay undermines the safety and security of our entire system. We are at a critical moment in aviation safety, and we need our leaders to be focused on the necessary infrastructure and staffing improvements.

Alabama Cattlemen's Association: As stewards of both our nation’s food supply and its natural resources, Alabama’s beef cattle producers deserve the stability of a functioning government that supports their work. We urge lawmakers to fulfill their basic responsibility to the American people, set aside political differences, and restore stability through the swift passage of a clean continuing resolution, ensuring that essential agricultural programs and services remain uninterrupted.

Alabama Farmers Federation: It’s harvest season in Alabama, and farmers don’t have the luxury of shutting down. Neither should the federal government.

Alliance for Biosecurity: The Alliance for Biosecurity urges Congress to prioritize national security and public health by passing a Continuing Resolution to keep the government open. Our nation’s biosecurity depends on continuous investment and uninterrupted coordination between federal agencies and private industry. A lapse in funding would directly undermine the nation’s ability to prepare for and respond to biological threats, whether naturally occurring, accidental, or deliberate. Alliance for Biosecurity members stand ready to continue working with federal partners to advance preparedness and safeguard our nation.

Allied Pilots Association: We stand with our brothers and sisters in air traffic control and TSA who continue to show up to work every day without a paycheck. These men and women take their oath seriously to guarantee a safe National Airspace System so we the pilots can ensure the flying public reaches their destinations in a timely manner and without harm. As the shutdown stretches on and airports encounter potential delays, it only intensifies the pressure these aviation professionals confront in the face of not getting paid. It’s time we support these men and women and reopen the federal government.

American Cement Association: Prolonged disruptions in federal operations threaten critical infrastructure projects, delay permitting, and create uncertainty across the cement and concrete value chain. A stable and functioning government is essential to providing certainty and momentum in sustainable development, economic growth, public safety, and energy dominance.

American Council of Engineering Companies: A shutdown has a detrimental impact across the economy, causing delays in the permitting and execution of critical infrastructure projects and hurting the clients and communities we serve. Our member companies are on the front lines of delivering safe, dependable infrastructure that supports economic growth and quality of life. ACEC calls on policymakers to work swiftly toward a resolution that ensures continuity of government services and upholds the stability our industry needs to design and build for America’s future.

American Exploration and Production Council: America’s independent oil and natural gas producers work every day to deliver the energy that powers our economy, and a fully functioning federal government is critical to supporting domestic energy production. Government shutdowns threaten to stall the development of oil and gas resources on federal lands – delaying energy projects and hurting consumers who depend on affordable, reliable energy. AXPC urges Congress to pass the Continuing Resolution to keep the government open.

American Farm Bureau Federation: [A shutdown] has significant consequences on farmers who work to produce the food our nation relies on. Currently, farmers are weathering an economic storm, facing row crop prices at near record lows while production expenses continue to increase… Adding a shutdown to the mix would only add more uncertainty, interrupt critical services, delay payments, and place more strain on rural communities already feeling pressure.

American Federation of Government Employees: This week, Congress pushed our nation into the fourth week of a full government shutdown – an avoidable crisis that is harming families, communities, and the very institutions that hold our country together. It’s time to pass a clean continuing resolution and end this shutdown today. No half measures, and no gamesmanship. Put every single federal worker back on the job with full back pay — today. These are patriotic Americans – parents, caregivers, and veterans – forced to work without pay while struggling to cover rent, groceries, gas, and medicine because of political disagreements in Washington. That is unacceptable. The path forward for Congress is clear: Reopen the government immediately under a clean continuing resolution that allows continued debate on larger issues. Ensure back pay for every single employee who has served or been forced to stay home through no fault of their own.

America First Policy Institute: Continuing America's comeback success means funding our government. Failing to protect our economic and national security interests at home and abroad would diminish this momentum.

American Gas Association: A government shutdown will not impact the reliable service utilities provide to homes and businesses across the country; however, a failure to pass a clean continuing resolution may have serious implications for vital energy programs for the poorest and most vulnerable Americans. Furthermore, the longer the government is shut down, the longer Congress remains gridlocked and unable to continue momentum towards permitting reform, which is critical to President Trump’s energy agenda by unleashing abundant domestic energy to support the American economy and our families.

American Hotel & Lodging Association: Hotel owners are on the front lines of America’s economy — and every day this shutdown continues, it puts more small businesses and jobs at risk. When the government shuts down, uncertainty ripples across every community. Conferences get canceled, families postpone trips, and hotels lose valuable business. Congress must act quickly to restore confidence, reopen the government, and support the industries that keep America’s economy moving.

American Legion: [HR 5371] ensures continuity for programs that are vital to veterans’ health care, housing, and benefits. By extending authorities for critical initiatives… Congress will protect lifelines that combat veteran suicide, expand access to mental health in rural communities, and prevent veteran homelessness. Veterans, uniformed service members, and their families are living in times of tremendous uncertainty... Passing a continuing resolution is the first step to honor their sacrifices and maintain our national security.

American Petroleum Institute: The American oil and natural gas industry’s mission of delivering reliable energy depends on a functioning federal government. Prolonging this shutdown risks delaying critical projects & adding regulatory uncertainty. Congress must swiftly pass a clean CR & reopen the government.

Americans for Prosperity: This continuing resolution is a necessary step to avoid a harmful and unnecessary government shutdown… [A shutdown is] a lose-lose scenario that undermines trust in government and delivers poor outcomes for the American people. There’s no reason Washington should keep repeating this broken cycle.

American Telemedicine Association: ATA Action supports and endorses the short-term continuing resolution language put forward by U.S. House leadership that extends Medicare telehealth flexibilities and the Acute Hospital Care at Home program through November 21. This is the only viable legislative vehicle up for consideration that will ensure these essential programs do not lapse.

American Trucking Association: America’s hardworking truckers do their job every day to deliver for the American people, and they expect their government to do the same. We urge Congress to pass a clean continuing resolution to reopen the government immediately.

AMVETS: Congress must act without delay to pass this measure and ensure the VA can continue delivering lifesaving services to veterans and their families.

Arizona Chamber of Commerce & Industry: Arizona’s economy thrives on stability. Prolonged debates that put government operations at risk create ripple effects of uncertainty for employers, workers, and investors alike. The effects of that uncertainty would extend across our economy, delaying critical government contracts and ultimately threatening both Arizona’s industries and the nation’s economic security.

Arkansas Bankers Association: Arkansas banks remain dedicated to our customers and are OPEN for business. The Arkansas Bankers Association urges Congress to pass a clean CR to avoid impacting federal employees, military, and government agencies with lending programs that assist our farmers and our communities. We encourage federal employees and others impacted to reach out to your bank as soon as possible about your personal situation to see what help may be available.

Arkansas Cattlemen's Association: The Arkansas Cattlemen’s Association urges Congress to act swiftly to reopen the government by passing funding legislation. Family farmers and ranchers cannot afford to be caught in political gridlock. Keeping the government open is essential to maintaining the stability of our food supply, protecting rural livelihoods, and ensuring cattle producers have the tools they need to continue feeding Arkansas and the nation.

Asian Pacific Action Network: A government shutdown would be a disaster for everyday people. It would delay paychecks for our troops, disrupt benefits for veterans, hurt seniors and children who depend on basic services, and create uncertainty for small businesses that drive our communities. Many in our community still remember the pain of past shutdowns—and we cannot afford to go through that again. This isn’t about politics—it’s about PEOPLE. It’s about parents making sure they can provide for their children, seniors depending on their retirement benefits, and workers needing stability in a time when the cost of living is already too high. The clean CR on the table is not new or extreme. It simply keeps the government open at the levels already agreed upon, while giving Congress more time to debate long-term reforms. That’s a fair and responsible path. We urge Congress to set aside the games, pass a clean CR, and show the American people that their leaders can still put families above politics.

Associated Builders and Contractors: ABC urges the Senate to act swiftly to pass the clean continuing resolution to extend funding, ensuring the government reopens and critical work can resume to support our economy, small businesses, and national security.

Associated Equipment Distributors: Government shutdowns are shouldered by hardworking men and women, including those that build and maintain roads, bridges, water systems, and pipelines, and farmers and ranchers that feed America. The Senate should approve the House-passed CR immediately and reopen the government as negotiations continue to a longer-term solution.

Associated General Contractors of America: The longer the government is shut, the more likely construction employment around the country could be impacted negatively. That is why we are urging Congress to quickly pass, as it has many times in the past, a clean continuing resolution that will allow the federal government to reopen and vital infrastructure and public works projects to continue. Construction workers around the country are counting on Congress to do its job and fund the government.

Association of Mature American Citizens: The demands reportedly being made by Democrat leaders to keep the government open, including healthcare for illegal aliens and funding for public broadcasting stations that consistently peddle harmful falsehoods about conservatives, are unpopular and unreasonable requests. President Trump and Republican leaders have the support of America’s seniors in rejecting these demands… Pass a clean CR. Keep the government open. Protect America’s seniors.

Bienvenido: A government shutdown would harm millions of hardworking Americans, including Hispanic families who are part of the federal workforce, depend on small business contracts, and rely on essential services. Past shutdowns have cost taxpayers billions, delayed pay for critical workers, and shaken confidence in the economy. Congress must act quickly to keep the government open and protect the economic stability that Hispanic communities depend on.

Blue Star Families: War or peace, life or death, whatever the country asks, our military and their families will do it. We ask for some loyalty from those who send us into harm’s way in return; the least of which is paying us. So Congress has to figure out how to work together to pass a budget or at least a CR. Period.

Border Trade Alliance: Furloughs, reduced staffing, and any service interruptions would create costly delays and jeopardize economic stability on both sides of the border. Just as concerning, our frontline Customs and Border Protection personnel, who are already stretched thin, would be forced to work without pay, further straining morale, recruitment, and retention. The Border Trade Alliance urges the U.S. Senate to swiftly pass a continuing resolution to ensure that our hardworking professionals in cross-border security and trade can continue to do their jobs without a lapse in pay. Preventing a shutdown is essential for trade, security, and the economic well-being of the entire country.

Business Roundtable: Funding the government is an essential responsibility of Congress. A government shutdown would create uncertainty, disrupt critical services, and harm American businesses, workers, and families. Business Roundtable urges Congress to act promptly to avoid a government shutdown.

Cellular Telecommunications and Internet Association: We support the extension of the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015, included in the House of Representatives’ Continuing Resolution. CISA 2015 established a vital legal framework that enables trusted cyber threat information sharing between the public and private sectors, and this collaboration has strengthened cybersecurity efforts across critical infrastructure, including wireless networks. This will ensure Americans continue to be protected from evolving cyber threats while Congress pursues a long-term extension of the Act.

Citizens Against Government Waste: Senator Schumer caused the government shutdown by trying to conjure $1.5 trillion in hocus-pocus spending programs. The Schumer Shutdown is being rejected by the American people because they know his demands are outrageous and would increase spending by $1.5 trillion. Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress are doing what's best for taxpayers by keeping spending at current levels.

Coalition for Jewish Values: It is troubling to imagine that during Yom Kippur, when Jews are still more concentrated in their synagogues throughout the day and particularly vulnerable, that officials at the U.S. DOJ & DHS in Washington might not be at their desks, pro-actively coordinating police protection and responding to any incidents that might arise on the holiest day on the Jewish calendar, due to a government shutdown. The shutdown will also harm the many families whose breadwinners are employed by the Federal government in civil service positions, when expenses are particularly high due to this holiday season. We urge both parties to employ the necessary short-term measures to keep government open and functioning, while the parties work to resolve their differences regarding a final budget over the coming months.

Center for Urban Renewal and Education:It’s time for Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and fellow Democrats to heed the arguments they have repeatedly advanced in the past, resist pressure from their radical base, and do what’s right for the American people. Senate Democrats insist on funding bloated, wasteful, and ideologically progressive programs, including provisions they said would be “temporary” during the COVID pandemic… It’s time for Democrats to stop deceiving the American people and get our bloated federal budget under control. Senate Democrats should stop their brinkmanship, follow the House’s lead, and pass a clean CR!

Coalition of Airline Pilots Association: We call on Congress to end the government shutdown by passing a clean Continuing Resolution. We as pilots adhere to strict procedures promoting safety as our most important priority. We have seen the stress and tension this year on the National Airspace System due to short-staffed air traffic controllers. This shutdown only compounds the pressures they face as they now report to work without a paycheck. Congress must support these men and women by ending this shutdown immediately

Committee for a Responsible Federal Government: Despite all the talk in recent months about addressing waste in government, we are about to create a totally wasteful situation: a government shutdown. For the good of the country, lawmakers should work together in good faith to keep the lights on tonight. Shutdowns don’t save money, they waste money. Under shutdowns, we pay federal workers not to work and rent buildings that aren’t being used, all while requiring costly shutdown planning, inefficient allocation of government resources, and a reduction in the services available to the American people.

Concerned Veterans for America: This government shutdown could be catastrophic for the veteran community, especially the most vulnerable among us, including vets who are service-connected, elderly, and homeless… We’re calling on all lawmakers to do the right thing, for veterans and for America.

Conservatives for Property Rights:The Democrats own a government shutdown. They would rather hurt President Trump than keep the government open… Democrats are demanding that extremist liberal policies be included as the price for keeping the government open, and it’s outrageous!

Distilled Spirits Council: The federal government shutdown will have a significant and detrimental impact on the Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB), the lead federal agency responsible for permitting, regulating and collecting taxes on distilled spirits. We urge Congress to act swiftly to resolve the shutdown and ensure uninterrupted operations at TTB to protect American consumers, distilleries of all sizes, and the broader U.S. economy.

Ducks Unlimited: The availability of public lands is paramount to hunters, anglers, hikers, and many other outdoor enthusiasts. A government shutdown would limit access to the outdoors for millions of Americans in national parks, national wildlife refuges, and many other areas designated for public recreation. Likewise, a shutdown could disrupt ongoing projects to conserve and restore critical habitat for waterfowl and other wildlife that support our cherished outdoor traditions. With hunting season already underway in some states and right around the corner for others, we urge Congress to come together and keep the government open for the benefit of all Americans.

Economic Policy Innovation Center: The House has already passed a clean CR. The Senate can – and should – advance the current spending levels to reopen the government and continue negotiations on full-year appropriations.

Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association: Federal law enforcement officers will continue to show up and protect this country, even when the government shuts down, but it’s unacceptable to ask them to do so without pay. Missed or delayed paychecks still mean missed mortgage payments, empty refrigerators, and mounting stress. We’re out there every day disrupting violent criminal networks, stopping the flow of deadly fentanyl, and protecting our communities. But during a shutdown, we’re also being asked to fill administrative gaps left by furloughed colleagues. It’s not just a hardship, it’s a dangerous distraction.

Foundation for Government Accountability: The clean CR before the Senate is nothing more than a date change on the same bipartisan spending plan Republicans and Democrats agreed to back in March. This is not the end of democracy or an ‘authoritarian power grab’ – it’s a generous status quo agreement… Democrats are forcing a shutdown while demanding $1.5 trillion in new spending on fringe leftist priorities that the American people already rejected.

Georgia Chamber of Commerce:A stable Georgia economy requires a stable federal government. Prolonged political debates that risk shutting down the federal government create ripple effects of uncertainty in communities across Georgia for our members, farmers, small businesses, global investors, and the state’s long-term competitiveness. We urge Congress to act quickly to protect our employers, our workforce, and critical infrastructure.

Heritage Action: Weeks after Speaker Mike Johnson and House Republicans passed a clean continuing resolution, Democrats—under the ‘leadership’ of Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries—are continuing their embarrassing tantrum. Shutting down the government over health care for illegal aliens isn’t some noble stand; it’s a sabotage of the mandate the American people gave to President Trump in November. This sad attempt to revive rock-bottom poll numbers and stave off primary challenges from socialists in their party won’t end well for them. The House has acted. It’s time for Senate Democrats to save themselves from their leadership and end their government shutdown.

Independent Women’s Forum: Americans did not vote for a dysfunctional government. They want a right-sized government, and so far, this Congress has taken that mandate seriously… We urge all members to pass this clean CR to prevent disruptions to national security, public safety, veterans care, and social safety net programs while bringing back fiscal responsibility.

International Brotherhood of Teamsters: Congress is playing the same blame and delay game that corporations play with American workers seeking a first contract. A shutdown will hurt working people. Period. American workers are not bargaining chips. Senators should stop screwing around and pass the House-passed clean, short-term funding bill.

International Franchise Association: The shutdown is now in its second day and is harming new and existing franchise business owners from accessing critical financing from Small Business Administration programs like 7a & 504. A clean CR is the quickest way to reopen programs critical to America’s 800,000 small business franchise owners.

Iowa Cattlemen's Association: While a government shutdown has adverse implications for many, it is especially detrimental to farmers and ranchers across the U.S., who utilize government programs, services, and expertise to assist with running productive and profitable operations — the same farmers and ranchers responsible for feeding our nation and those around the globe. On behalf of the Iowa cattle producer members we serve, we encourage legislators to act swiftly to find a resolution to this shutdown.

Job Creators Network: Senate Democrats are holding basic government operations and the small businesses that depend on them hostage to taxpayer payoffs to the crony health insurance industry. By refusing to adopt the House’s sensible continuing resolution, Senate Democrats are putting their big health insurance donors above the interests of small businesses and ordinary Americans.

Louisiana Farm Bureau: In the midst of harvest and field work, most farmers aren’t focused on politics. However, farmers do rely on agencies and offices through USDA and other government services for essential partnerships. In such a critical time for agriculture, on the cusp of an economic crisis that we’ve been warning Washington, D.C., about for quite some time, the last thing farmers need is their government to not be operating when they need them most. We appreciate both Congress and the White House for the support they’ve shown agriculture. But if that support is closed for business, it will only add to the quandary agriculture is in.

Maine State Chamber of Commerce: The economy does not need additional uncertainty, and a federal government shutdown would create a ripple effect of uncertainty for employers, workers, and communities across Maine… The impacts of a shutdown could extend from delayed federal contracts and services to the possibility of closing Acadia National Park during the height of leaf-peeping season – a closure that would impact the local economy and harm small businesses that depend on fall visitors.

Meat Institute: A government shutdown is disruptive to meat and poultry companies whose daily operations require government oversight. We urge leaders on both sides of the aisle to avoid a shutdown.

Modern Skies Coalition: Shutdowns are extremely detrimental to the passengers and shippers as well as the aviation community because they force the FAA to, among other things, suspend air traffic controller and technician hiring and training, delay the implementation of safety initiatives, postpone maintenance and repair work to critical air traffic equipment, suspend air carrier pilot check rides, delay airworthy inspections for aircraft, defer the analysis of voluntary safety reporting, and suspend work on modernization programs… To maintain our position as the world leader in aviation, we must always strive to improve safety and efficiency and continuously work further to mitigate risk.

Moms for America: Moms for America is calling on the United States Senate to immediately pass the CLEAN Continuing Resolution to reopen the federal government. Every day this shutdown continues, families face uncertainty, vital services like flood insurance during hurricane season, veterans’ health care, and housing programs are all at risk. This is not about politics; it is about people, and the House has already passed a responsible, clean resolution to keep the government funded through November 21, 2025.

National Air Traffic Controllers Association: NATCA advocates for every excepted employee, every federal employee that’s out there, to be paid no matter what the circumstance, no matter what the shutdown. And we’re ensuring that our message is loud and clear. There’s one way to do it. And that’s by ending this shutdown and putting everybody back to work and having them compensated for the work they do day in and day out, especially air traffic controllers.

National Asphalt and Pavement Association: A government shutdown jeopardizes the Department of Transportation and Federal Highway Administration’s abilities to maintain their funding and reimbursement requirements to State Departments of Transportation as NAPA members maintain, improve, and expand our national roadway network. Our industry, like so many others, depends on normal government operations as we deliver more effective and safer roadway projects in every Congressional district.

National Association of Home Builders: Americans deserve certainty and stability in the flood insurance marketplace so that they can protect their homes, businesses, and loved ones… The risk of an unnecessary National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) lapse puts American lives, families, properties, and businesses at untenable risk and must be avoided. Extending the NFIP will ensure this crucial program remains available, providing essential insurance coverage for residential and commercial property owners, buyers, managers, renters, and tenants nationwide.

National Association of Police Organizations: If lawmakers neglect their constitutional duties, allow funding to run out, and shut down the government, federal law enforcement officers, who are working to protect our cities and communities from violent crime, drugs, and guns, will be putting their lives on the line without getting paid.

National Association of Realtors:Americans deserve certainty and stability in the flood insurance marketplace so that they can protect their homes, businesses, and loved ones… Without access to flood insurance, American families must rely on federal disaster aid, which is severely limited… The risk of an unnecessary NFIP lapse puts American lives, families, properties, and businesses at untenable risk and must be avoided.

National Cattlemen's Beef Association:America’s hardworking farmers and ranchers need predictability and stability from government, and House leadership is leading the charge to do just that. We encourage the Senate to follow suit and ensure that this continuing resolution reaches the President’s desk as soon as possible.

National Chicken Council: Following House passage, NCC today is urging the Senate to follow suit and pass a Continuing Resolution (CR) that would prevent the government from shutting down. Businesses need certainty, and the President signing a CR would help provide it.

National Fraternal Order of Police: One of the most fundamental responsibilities of Congress is to provide funding for the operations of our Federal government—they have got to pay the bills… The Senate’s rejection [of the clean CR] will cause major disruptions for programs that fund public safety efforts in our communities.

National Grocers Association: A lapse in funding will seriously jeopardize critical programs that grocers and their customers rely on – including SNAP and WIC – which will have limited funding and threaten food access for millions of low-income Americans should a shutdown occur.

National Small Business Association: Manufacturing this magnitude of a crisis simply to grandstand and win partisan points is irresponsible and unacceptable. While Members of Congress will continue to get paid, the millions of small businesses who rely on the federal government will not. They, their families, and every business in their pipeline will feel the pinch of a shutdown – they always do.

National Stone, Sand & Gravel Association: This critical legislation ensures continued government funding that our industry depends on to keep construction moving forward by preventing further disruption to federal project funding and payments, and regulatory and permitting bottlenecks… These disruptions threaten the timely delivery of infrastructure improvements that communities rely on nationwide.

NetJets Association of Shared Aircraft Pilots: How can we possibly expect our industry peers to be fully focused on their responsibilities – chief of which is keeping the flying public safe and secure – when many are likely wondering how long they are going to go without pay. And, more specifically, how do they continue to care for their families – to put food on the table? The strain this is placing on all stakeholders – federal employees, flight crews, and the traveling public is taking a toll. It is indisputable that our system is less safe today than it was on Oct. 1 when the shutdown began.

Parents Defending Education: Keeping the government open should be bipartisan. A clean CR does that without wasting taxpayer money on things like earmarks, pet projects, and attempts to re-fund programs that deserve to be shut down.

Pennsylvania Chamber of Business and Industry: A shutdown would have serious consequences for Pennsylvania’s economy, workforce, and communities – undermining business confidence, disrupting federal services, and threatening critical operations that families and employers rely on every day.

Professional Services Council: From an industry perspective, it is critically important to keep the federal government open… As you know, a shutdown disrupts efficiency and effectiveness of agency operations, threatening the ability of agencies to achieve their vital missions… When funding lapses, projects stall… In addition, shutdowns have a significantly destabilizing effect on the contracting workforce and inflict lasting harm on the U.S. business base… Finally, shutdowns weaken the broader economy.

Small Business & Entrepreneurship Council: SBE Council strongly supports the CR and urges every U.S. House Member to vote in favor of this sensible step to keep the federal government open, allowing for discussions to continue on longer-term funding matters. Small business owners, their employees, and local communities… need certainty and confidence that elected officials and government leaders are delivering on stability, not disruptive action that could potentially undermine growth and planning.

Southwest Airlines Pilots Association: Considering the strain on our nation’s aviation system, SWAPA strongly urges Congress to pass a clean Continuing Resolution to fund the government. Our air traffic controllers and the broader air traffic system are already operating under immense pressure — a government shutdown only compounds that stress and threatens the efficiency of our skies as we see the impact of reduced controller availability at facilities across the country. Likewise, TSA professionals continue to show up every day to safeguard the traveling public, even without pay. These men and women deserve our full support and the certainty of a paycheck.

Steamfitters Local 638 (NYC): On behalf of thousands of hardworking men and women in New York and our retirees, Steamfitters Local 638 of New York City and Long Island urges our political leaders to pass the clean continuing resolution so that the American people don’t bear the burden of Washington’s inaction. For too long now, Government shutdowns have become a normal part of the bargaining process in Washington DC... The call to action is clear: Democrats must reopen the government through the passage of the clean continuing resolution.

Taxpayers Protection Alliance: A clean CR isn’t partisan—it’s the bare minimum to keep the government running. Congress has failed to reach an agreement that would pass a continuing resolution (CR) and fund the government, triggering a government shutdown. This is an extremely disruptive and painful situation for millions of Americans that could have been avoided if Congress had fulfilled its basic duty of appropriating funds instead of opting for short-term spending deals.

Texas Association of Business: On the heels of historic legislation to boost business activity and spur job creation across the U.S., a shutdown of the federal government right now would inject unnecessary uncertainty for Texas businesses and communities that rely on certainty and stability to plan and grow their operations.

United Postmasters and Managers of America: Hardworking American taxpayers are unable to access many government services because of the inability of the Congress to come to a short-term funding decision. An extended government shutdown could impact Federal employees looking to OPM to process their retirement, the upcoming open season for Medicare, and those claiming Social Security benefits

U.S. Chamber of Commerce: Government shutdowns are harmful to the economy, our national security, and the American people, often in ways that are not immediately obvious… From passports and permits to clinical trials and air travel, a well-functioning economy requires a functioning government.

Vegas Chamber: A shutdown would immediately disrupt air travel, customs processing, and other essential federal services that keep Nevada’s tourism economy moving. Visitors from around the world rely on safe, efficient travel to reach Las Vegas’s resorts, conventions, and small businesses. Any slowdown could reduce visitor confidence, directly impacting thousands of workers whose livelihoods depend on a strong tourism sector.

Michigan-based Slate Auto has operated in stealth since 2022.

Earlier in April, its first vehicle was spotted in California, appearing to confirm the company’s plans to enter the market with a compact, low-cost electric pickup.

“A Slate is a two-door electric pickup truck that’s thoughtfully designed and engineered to be customized again and again to transform into whatever you need it to be: even an SUV,” the EV maker says on its website.

It further adds that the vehicle’s “designed to be radically affordable, expected to be priced in the mid-twenties.”

Slate vehicles will be rear-wheel drive with a single, rear-mounted 150kW motor.

It will not include a built-in infotainment system as, according to the brand, they “raise a car’s price, and they become outdated quickly and have high failure rates.”

According to a TechCrunch report earlier this year, hundreds of employees have been hired over the last few years, including from major automakers such as Ford, General Motors, Stellantis, and Harley-Davidson.

Production is targeted to begin in late 2026 at a facility near Indianapolis, Indiana, according to job postings, state records, and an interview with executive chairman Rodney Copes, the report said.

According to Slate, orders will also be opening in late 2026 in the United States.

Sol- og vindenergi forventes fortsat at bidrage til kapacitetsudvidelser trods politiske ændringer, der begrænser skattelettelser. Atomkraft oplever vækst i investeringer, men dens større bidrag til energimixet vil realiseres på lang sigt. Geotermisk energi får stigende opmærksomhed og investering, støttet af teknologisk innovation. USA sigter mod en diversificeret energimix for at opretholde konkurrenceevnen i den globale AI-kapløb.

Fra ING:

To meet surging power demand, the US needs to leverage all sources of energy with a laser focus on efficiency, reliability and affordability, not least if it’s going to win the AI race too

Swift action to assert energy dominance

Nine months into its term, the Trump administration has acted swiftly to reshape how the US produces, uses, and exports energy. On day one of his presidency, Trump signed a series of Executive Orders to promote energy dominance. Energy Secretary Chris Wright subsequently announced the goal of delivering affordable, reliable, and secure energy. To achieve this, fossil fuels are being prioritised. This includes opening more federal lands for drilling, expediting liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects, and rolling back more than 30 environmental regulations.

Some clean energy technologies also made it into the administration’s core energy strategy, such as nuclear and geothermal, both of which are receiving incentives and regulatory streamlining. But other clean energy sources face much greater challenges. In July, Congress passed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), significantly reducing the availability of tax credits for technologies such as wind, solar, EVs, and hydrogen.

The ambition to win the AI race depends on energy dominance

The Trump administration’s vision for US energy dominance may not include every form of energy, but its ambition to win the AI race clearly demands it. Power demand from AI-driven data centres is projected to surge this decade, likely exceeding 10% of the national power demand by 2030, up from 4% today.

To meet this demand, the US needs to pragmatically leverage all available energy sources.

Fossil fuels alone cannot do the job due to supply chain constraints, rising equipment costs, and, in some cases, unfavourable economics.

Solar and wind would therefore help expand power capacity, though their contribution would be more limited than previously projected.

Nuclear and geothermal roles will increase over time, too.

Investing in clean energy can also, in the long run, maintain US competitiveness against China, which is already dominating the manufacturing and export of many technologies.

Natural gas and coal face constraints in ramping up power capacity

The energy demand from AI-driven data centres is placing enormous pressure on the power sector. To meet this challenge, the sector must expand installed capacity, upgrade the grid and make it more flexible. Natural gas and coal, in the short term, would play a stronger role in providing an adequate supply, but these two sources alone would not be sufficient.

Natural gas is a favoured generation source to power the AI growth

Natural gas has emerged as a favoured generation source to power the AI growth due to its low cost and ability to deliver uninterrupted electricity, but the ambition to increase natural gas power capacity faces major challenges. The production backlog of utility-scale Combined Cycle Gas Turbines (CCGTs) until the end of the decade has led to higher production costs of gas-fired electricity. Rystad Energy observed that a typical CCGT plant’s capex has frequently surpassed $2,500KW since the first quarter of 2025 alone. That’s up from $1,200-1600/KW between 2023-24 and just $800-1,000/KW in the seven years between 2015 and 2022.

The capex is under pressure to continue trending higher, with buyers maintaining a high willingness to pay the premium. Data centre companies, hoping to expand their businesses quickly, are turning to alternatives such as simple-cycle gas turbines (including aero-derivative turbines) and reciprocating engines. Albeit less efficient, these alternatives are smaller, more agile systems that can quickly ramp up and down to meet the operational power requirements of AI training data centres. This can moderately assuage the CCGT’s shortage in the short term, though gas-fired power is still poised to fall short of the desired supply.

The administration is also aiming to revive the coal industry, recently announcing $625m of funding to help retrofit and recommission coal-fired power plants. This would extend the lifeline of coal assets, especially on the back of rising electricity demand and constraints on power capacity growth from natural gas and renewables. This year, US coal production has increased by more than 6%. Several coal-fired power plants are also being kept online past their expected retirement dates.

Expected vs. realised power capacity retirements for 2Q 2025

Gigawatts (GW)

However, coal is still in structural decline, and the administration’s supportive policies are unlikely to return it to its golden days. The levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) from coal in the US is now roughly $71-173/MWh, higher than $48-109/MWh for natural gas from combined-cycle gas turbines and $50-131 for utility-scale solar with battery storage, according to Lazard.

The spending needed to upgrade coal’s ageing infrastructure or to keep an uneconomic coal power plant from retiring means the industry will likely not see a material production boom.

Weaker-than-projected role for renewables, but they are still needed

Given the limitations of natural gas and coal, renewables need to – and are indeed – contributing to expanding US power capacity. Following the massive project development spurred by the Inflation Reduction Act, solar and wind are expected to remain the primary drivers of capacity additions in 2025 and 2026.

Nevertheless, the potential for solar and wind to boost the US electricity supply has become more constrained due to recent policy changes.

As discussed in a previous article , the OBBBA would increase the cost of solar and wind projects when the tax credits phase out, though some can still be cost-competitive with natural gas. Developers have been actively working to safeguard their projects by meeting the ‘start of construction’ deadline and the ‘foreign entities of concern’ (FEOC) requirements. Larger companies with ample resources are better positioned to comply. They can demonstrate ‘start of construction’ on time, either by initiating physical work or incurring at least 5% of the cost by 2 September 2025. Some have also met the ‘continuity of construction’ test by consistently purchasing equipment such as transformers.

We could see increasing consolidation

Regarding the FEOC requirements, some had begun pre-emptively shifting away from heavy reliance on China as early as a few years ago. Therefore, these companies’ existing pipelines should be mostly unaffected. But smaller companies may face greater challenges, and we could see increasing consolidation as the impact of OBBBA becomes more pronounced.

We have also argued that without tax credits, solar and wind companies can still enhance profitability through securing higher power purchase agreement (PPA) prices and developing storage technologies. But so far, developers’ focus is on grandfathering and executing existing projects, with limited attention to expanding pipelines. This means that, in the short term, installed capacity can still grow steadily, but once the tax credit deadlines pass, capacity additions will slow, effectively squeezing the industry’s multi-year development marathon into a sprint.

There have also been signals of an early pivot in clean energy investment. Although US clean investment registered a 5% year-over-year increase during the first half of 2025, the clean energy manufacturing investment subcategory experienced a two-consecutive-quarter decline. Notably, in Q2 2025, clean energy manufacturing saw, for the first time, a higher volume of investment cancellations than announcements. This slowing trend is expected to persist, with possibly lower appetite for new investment and more cancelled projects.

But again, the demand for renewable power will continue to grow. Corporate America will be incentivised to pursue more renewable power to improve their operations, with a recent survey showing that 87% of US firms are maintaining or increasing sustainability spending in 2025.

Additionally, the Department of Energy (DOE) recently finalised a $1.6bn loan guarantee for American Electric Power (AEP) to upgrade 5,000 miles of transmission lines across Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma, and West Virginia. This will benefit renewables by enabling more efficient power transmission across the Midwest. While it’s unclear if other transmission projects will receive funding, the DOE’s support for AEP shows its practical approach to improving grid reliability and reducing costs.

Nuclear’s outlook hinges on up-scaling and supply chain management

Nuclear arguably has the most momentum today – driven not only by tech companies’ betting on it as clean baseload power, but also by the US government’s support that spans the Biden and second Trump administrations.

Following a spike in 2024, AI-driven data centre companies have cumulatively announced 28GW in capacity from Q1 2023 to Q2 2025 for their operations. Investment has surged accordingly. For instance, there has been almost $10bn in public and private investment in novel small modular reactor (SMR) technologies in the US since 2019.

However, the projected higher contribution of nuclear to the US power mix remains a medium to long-term story. Now, all the additional nuclear capacity expected to become available in the next year or two will be from restarts of idle traditional plants. No SMR plants are running in the US today; a handful of SMR projects are under construction, including Holtec’s “Mission 2030” in Michigan and TerraPower’s Natrium Project in Wyoming. And while estimates vary, the average LCOE for SMRs remains substantially above that of many existing energy sources. Holtec’s pledged construction timeline, if successfully implemented, would bring the first SMR commercial operation to the US in 2030.

Moreover, both traditional nuclear plants and SMRs need adequate supply chain management to consistently contribute to power generation. Both utilise nuclear fission technology, which generates energy by splitting heavy atoms like uranium. The US’s domestic uranium production has been in recovery in recent years, with the volume in the first two quarters of 2025 already surpassing the full year’s volume in 2024. But the US is still heavily reliant on imports, with domestic production only able to satisfy 8% of its needs.

US uranium purchases and production

Source: US Energy Information Administration. Note: Data breakdown of US purchased uranium by origin is not available for 2019, 2020, and 2022. Data of US total production of uranium concentrate is not available for 2020 and 2021; data for 2025 only reflects Q1 and Q2.

But even with imports, there can still be a uranium supply gap, possibly mounting to 20.5m pounds of U3O8 equivalent in 2030. With limited potential to ramp up domestic uranium production quickly, the US would rely more on imports and be subject to global availability and pricing. In September, President Trump exempted uranium from tariffs, providing some relief to the nuclear industry. Nevertheless, the global uranium market will only become more competitive as countries worldwide accelerate investment in nuclear energy.

Fusion, another type of nuclear technology that shows great potential but is under development, also faces supply chain challenges. Unlike fission, nuclear fusion generates energy by smashing together two atoms (typically deuterium and tritium, two isotopes of hydrogen). Tritium exists in tiny quantities, with current world production totalling less than 4kg/year. Unlocking closed-loop tritium processing is therefore crucial for the technology’s development. Nuclear fusion also faces other challenges, such as the design of qualifying materials and the integration into the power system. The DOE’s new fusion roadmap, unveiled in October, aims to solve exactly those challenges and forge a path to commercialisation in the 2030s.

‘Drill baby, drill’ – but for geothermal

Geothermal is also gaining traction under both the Biden and the second Trump administrations, thanks to its ability to deliver reliable, round-the-clock clean energy. Across North America, geothermal attracted $1.7bn in public investment in Q1 2025 – already 85% of the total funding seen in all of 2024.

The US leads the world in installed conventional geothermal capacity – about 4 GW – thanks to favourable geology in the western states. However, conventional geothermal’s geographic limitations have spurred the development of advanced technologies like Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS) and Closed-Loop Geothermal Systems (CLGS).

The US is well-positioned to scale EGS, leveraging transferable skills from fracking in the oil and gas industry. Indeed, EGS developer Fervo, with ex-oil professionals on board, is building a 400 MW site in Utah by 2028 after a successful pilot in Nevada in 2023. Progress is also underway in CLGS: XGS Energy has successfully completed 3,000 hours of field-testing, paving the way for commercial construction.

The costs of geothermal vary across technologies. Conventional geothermal’s LCOE ranges from $66 to $109/MWh, making it broadly competitive with alternatives like CCGTs. In contrast, EGS and CLGS remain more expensive and are in earlier stages of development. Still, continuous tax credits and the willingness of tech companies to pay a premium – estimated at 20% in an analysis – are helping to make advanced geothermal projects commercially viable. Looking ahead, costs are expected to substantially decline, driven by technological advancements and supportive policies.

As geothermal gains popularity, competition for land leases is heating up. In 2025, the average price for public land leases for geothermal projects surged by 282%, reaching $127 per acre – up from just $33 in 2024. Geothermal may face other headwinds too, including concerns over increased seismic activity linked to EGS, as well as the possibly costly and extensive underground infrastructure needed for CLGS. Still, geothermal continues to enjoy strong bipartisan support and holds significant potential to meet the growing energy demands of the US.

A broad perspective of energy dominance

As discussed throughout the article, the US will need a diversified energy mix to meet the projected surge in electricity demand. This will become an essential enabler for maintaining its competitive edge in the global AI race.

Investing in multiple energy sources strengthens the strategy

Investing in a broad portfolio of energy sources – through research, workforce development, and capital – also strengthens the US energy dominance strategy. True energy dominance goes beyond producing and exporting energy to encompass leading in next-generation technologies, including clean energy.

Currently, China holds a commanding lead in manufacturing clean energy equipment, as shown below. But its influence extends further, advancing rapidly in clean energy technologies such as battery storage and nuclear power. Between 2017 and 2024, Chinese designs accounted for 25 of the 52 nuclear power projects that began construction globally, with Russian designs making up 23. China also operates one of the world’s few functioning SMR facilities, despite notable cost overruns.

But with significantly increased policy support and customer demand, the US’s global role in both traditional and SMR is set to strengthen over the next 10 years, especially in SMR. The International Energy Agency estimates that under the Announced Pledges Scenario, 35% of the global nuclear construction starts between 2025 and 2030 will have US designs, compared to 31% from Chinese designs, reversing China’s lead from 2017-24.

And just as with nuclear, long-term investment in a range of energy technologies will be key to achieving energy dominance. This approach will not only reinforce US leadership in the global energy landscape but also reduce reliance on foreign technologies – bolstering energy security and resilience.

Notably, this creek feeds into the Edwards Aquifer, which is the main source of drinking water for the San Antonio region.
PFAS contamination in drinking water is frightening when many studies show that higher PFAS levels in local drinking water correlate with increased regional rates of cancer, particularly kidney and testicular cancer.
Scientists have even estimated that PFAS found in drinking water likely causes over 6,800 cancer cases per year.
Rep. Helen Kerwin, R-Cleburne, introduced House Bill 1674, which requires regular testing for PFAS in fertilizers.","Birdsong in Minnesota and Wisconsin ceases as tree swallows fail to successfully hatch eggs. In coastal North Carolina, skin lesions and infected wounds appear all over the alligators of the Cape Fear River basin. Crayfish in the waters of northern Michigan scarcely forage for their food.

What links these events together?

PFAS, or per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances, constitute thousands of different synthetic chemicals. From pizza boxes to nonstick cookware to raincoats, PFAS has many uses across many industries for its ability to repel water—and it’s a known environmental toxicant.

PFAS does not break down naturally in the environment; it accumulates. Researchers have found significant levels of PFAS compounds all across the globe in various environments, including the atmosphere, aquatic environments, groundwater, drinking water, soil, and more.

Substances that persist and accumulate in the environment are extremely difficult to remove. That’s why any event releasing large amounts of PFAS is especially harmful—once released, these chemicals are likely to remain in the environment for a long time.

Many kinds of AFFF (a foam which firefighters use to extinguish flammable liquid fires) include PFAS.

In 2008, AFFF containing PFAS escaped from the grounds of the San Antonio International Airport into Salado Creek. Notably, this creek feeds into the Edwards Aquifer, which is the main source of drinking water for the San Antonio region.

PFAS contamination in drinking water is frightening when many studies show that higher PFAS levels in local drinking water correlate with increased regional rates of cancer, particularly kidney and testicular cancer. Scientists have even estimated that PFAS found in drinking water likely causes over 6,800 cancer cases per year.

Studies focusing on firefighters’ exposure to PFAS have revealed increased rates of colon, prostate, and testicular cancers. High incidences of cancer and cancer-related deaths in firefighters aren’t surprising with the way Firefighter Travis Temarantz described his experiences with the foam to WHYY: “You were covered in [the foam], regardless of in your gear or not, and you had it on your hands, it was on your face, the wind would blow back, you would be breathing it in.”

Across the board, PFAS negatively impacts human health. In addition to its carcinogenic properties, PFAS is also associated with higher blood cholesterol levels and even worsen the efficacy of vaccines by lowering antibody production.

Furthermore, PFAS undeniably harms the environment. Besides tree swallows, alligators, and crayfish, an array of research displays more of its harmful effects, from thyroid disruption in seals to devastating animal livestock and crops.

In 2024, a group of farmers in Johnson County, a county on the southwestern edges of the DFW metropolis, filed a lawsuit against Synagro Corporations. The suit alleged that Synagro’s biosolids fertilizer contained PFAS, which two plaintiffs said, “rendered [their property] worthless and will be costly and difficult to clean up and restore.” Eventually, the county was forced to declare a state of emergency due to dangerously high levels of PFAS contamination in the soil.

Rep. Helen Kerwin, R-Cleburne, introduced House Bill 1674, which requires regular testing for PFAS in fertilizers. With significant bipartisan support, over seventy House representatives signed onto the bill as co-authors; however, the bill missed legislative deadlines and was unable to advance past committee. In the past legislative session, many Texas bills addressing PFAS did not make it to or through committee, including House Bill 3738 by Rep. Joanne Shofner, R-Nacogdoches, which would have tested if PFAS were present in school cafeteria lunches.

SB 1898, a bill to ban the use of PFAS in firefighting foams except in emergencies, passed through the Senate but ran out of time before the House could vote on it.

Despite bipartisan support for many of these bills in the 2025 legislative session, none have actually passed. With an increasing number of cases such as the Johnson County farmers, as well as study-upon-study underscoring the dangers of PFAS exposure, the lack of state action is both detrimental and astounding for an issue as well-documented as this one.

Time and time again, PFAS have proven themselves to be public health hazards and harmful environmental contaminants.

Yet, despite this growing affordability crisis, Rocky Mountain Power’s parent company, PacifiCorp — owned by billionaire Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway — continues to propose higher rates while clinging to expensive, polluting coal plants.
Every year, PacifiCorp must submit a long-term energy plan to the Utah Public Service Commission.
Instead of choosing cheaper, cleaner energy, PacifiCorp plans to double down on costly coal and gas.
And yet, instead of seizing that opportunity, PacifiCorp is walking away from billions in federal clean energy investments that could lower costs and create jobs.","Across the country, families are feeling the sting of rising electricity costs — and Utah is no exception. Over the past year, our electricity prices have spiked by nearly 15%, one of the steepest increases in the nation. Nearly one in four Utahns now struggle to pay their electric bill in full.

Yet, despite this growing affordability crisis, Rocky Mountain Power’s parent company, PacifiCorp — owned by billionaire Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway — continues to propose higher rates while clinging to expensive, polluting coal plants. Instead of helping Utah families, the company seems more interested in padding profits.

Every year, PacifiCorp must submit a long-term energy plan to the Utah Public Service Commission. This plan is meant to identify the most cost-effective and reliable energy sources to meet our state’s needs. Right now, the commission is reviewing PacifiCorp’s latest proposal — and Utahns should be paying attention.

Instead of choosing cheaper, cleaner energy, PacifiCorp plans to double down on costly coal and gas. That choice would lock Utah ratepayers into years of higher bills and missed opportunities.

Even PacifiCorp’s own modeling shows that retiring one of its dirtiest coal plants — the Hunter facility — by 2030 would save customers money. But rather than move forward with that plan, the company is keeping coal units running indefinitely. In 2024, it even sought a 30% rate increase for Utah customers, 85% of which was tied directly to high fossil fuel costs.

Meanwhile, PacifiCorp has already acknowledged that renewable energy — especially wind — drives prices down. In its 2023 Wyoming rate case, the company reported that wind projects reduced costs across its service territory by $343 million. That’s real savings, spread across millions of customers.

And yet, instead of seizing that opportunity, PacifiCorp is walking away from billions in federal clean energy investments that could lower costs and create jobs. With just one year left to take advantage of the Inflation Reduction Act’s clean energy incentives, the company is choosing to forgo a 30% discount on new wind and solar projects — projects that could make our energy cheaper and our grid stronger.

According to a recent analysis by Utah Clean Energy, PacifiCorp’s reluctance to invest in renewables means leaving nearly $2 billion in federal funding on the table across its eastern service area. A recent Sierra Club report found that a high-renewable scenario would generate over $100 million in local tax revenue and create more than 20,000 new jobs right here in Utah — many in rural areas that need them most.

This isn’t just a climate issue. It’s a pocketbook issue, an economic development issue, and a fairness issue. Utahns shouldn’t have to foot the bill for PacifiCorp’s refusal to adapt.

Utah deserves that same reliability and savings.

As the Utah Public Service Commission considers whether it’ll approve PacifiCorp’s plan that benefits out-of-state shareholders, or push for a plan that serves Utahns, we have an opportunity to make our voices heard. Rocky Mountain Power customers can share their concerns by submitting comments to the commission, or even better, speak up in person at a public hearing on Oct. 29.

The CRGA Act will save Illinois families and businesses more than $13 billion on electricity bills over the next 20 years in direct response to the unprecedented price hikes felt across the state. A recent analysis by the Illinois Power Agency found the CRGA Act would save $13 for every $1 invested by consumers.

CRGA is the only bill proposed during the veto session designed to address the ongoing cost crisis. If legislators do not pass CRGA before the fall veto session ends on October 30, Illinois consumers will pay the price. Energy costs spiked as much as 50% across Illinois this summer and are already set to increase in 2026 due to poor regional and federal policy and increasing demand for energy. CRGA is urgently needed to begin reducing costs in the near- and long-term.

CRGA’s key policies include:

Building 3 gigawatts of clean energy storage, which will reduce costs and create thousands of good-paying union jobs

Establishing a Virtual Power Plant program, which pools energy from already built energy sources like household solar panels paired with battery storage, to deliver rapid savings

Strengthening energy efficiency programs

Empowering state agencies to better plan for future energy demand spikes

In addition to cost savings, the CRGA Act will help Illinois cope with the harmful impacts of newly enacted federal policies that are driving costs up and threatening thousands of jobs and billions of dollars in economic development.

Without state-level action, the Illinois Environmental Council projects the recent federal budget will:

Increase Illinois household energy costs by $400 per year and business costs by 21%

Eliminate up to 52,000 manufacturing and energy jobs in Illinois

Cancel $16.8 billion worth of in-state economic development

Put up to 105 facilities at risk of closure

CRGA is the only bill on the table during veto session that will address Illinois’ growing energy cost crisis and mitigate impacts of harmful federal policies.

Quotes About CRGA:

Sen. Bill Cunningham (18th Senate District): “No one has been spared from Illinois’ high electricity bills this summer, and the trend is clear that prices will only continue to increase unless the General Assembly takes action. Illinois has long been a leader in delivering clean, affordable, and reliable energy – and we have the chance to be the first state to directly respond to the Trump administration’s devastating rollback of the Inflation Reduction Act.”

Majority Leader Robyn Gabel (18th House District): “CRGA makes good on the promises we made when we passed CEJA in 2021. This legislation builds upon Illinois’ legacy of creating an equitable clean energy economy that lowers prices for everyone, protects our environment, and creates jobs and economic development opportunities that benefit historically disadvantaged communities across the state.”

Rep. Jay Hoffman (113th House District): “As lawmakers, the General Assembly has a duty to guarantee our state has access to plentiful, affordable, and clean energy. I am proud to stand behind the CRGA Act as a solution that delivers all of the above and sets our state up for future economic success.”

Stephanie Burgos-Veras, Senior Manager for Equity Programs, Coalition for Community Solar Access: “After Illinois families and businesses weathered a summer of unprecedented energy cost increases, CRGA will deliver cheaper, cleaner, and more reliable energy. A vote for CRGA is crucial to expanding access to clean and affordable energy for all Illinoisans, especially low-income households and renters, who will have more opportunities to utilize cost-saving programs such as community solar and energy efficiency initiatives.”

Lesley McCain, Executive Director, Illinois Solar Energy & Storage Association: “Thousands of solar workers and their families are facing an uncertain future as the Federal Government attacks our industry. Passing the Clean and Reliable Grid Act will give them much needed relief, protect all Illinois families from rising energy costs and secure billions of dollars in economic investment for communities across Illinois.”

Andrew Linhares, Central Region Senior Manager, Solar Energy Industries Association: “Inaction is not an option. The Illinois grid urgently needs all the electrons it can get, and solar and storage are the fastest, most cost-effective forms of energy to build. CRGA will save Illinois families money on their bills, create good jobs and economic development, and solidify Illinois once again as a clean energy leader.”

Jeff Danielson, Vice President of Advocacy, Clean Grid Alliance: “Illinois must meet this critical moment by investing in proven solutions that promote the stability and reliability of our grid while also lowering costs for homeowners and businesses. CRGA does just that, reducing rates for consumers and ensuring that the state’s economic development efforts are set up for success.”

Samarth Medakkar, Policy Principal, Advanced Energy United: “CRGA builds energy storage facilities here in Illinois instead of squandering our dollars on out-of-state gas plants or keeping old generators running. Gigawatts of batteries can be online before this decade is over if we pass the CRGA now. Otherwise, the projects that are ready to be built will go to other states—along with the savings, jobs, and tax revenue.”

Jen Walling, Spokesperson, Illinois Clean Jobs Coalition: “The CRGA Act is a win for consumers – it gives Illinoisans tools to save money on their utility bills right now through energy efficiency programs and increasing access to rebates. The CRGA Act is a win for our electric grid – it promotes improvements to grid infrastructure and increases the amount of clean electricity power lines can carry. And the CRGA Act is a win for our climate and clean energy workforce – it doubles the investment in renewable energy we made in CEJA, meaning more clean energy jobs, more consumer savings, and less air and climate pollution.”

Sarah Moskowitz, Executive Director, Citizens Utility Board (CUB): “Forces outside our state have caused wholesale power prices to skyrocket. As we face soaring electric bills, market architects applaud these high-price outcomes for sending ‘strong market signals.’ Well, then, it’s time for our state to respond to these signals and act now to protect Illinois consumers. SB25 gives us the tools to do that on a system-wide level to cost-effectively help us avoid electric price volatility and also on an individual basis so that regular residential consumers benefit.”

Brady Briska, Renewables Program Coordinator & Policy Analyst, LiveWire Construction: “Right now, Equity Eligible Contractors (EECs) are under attack by the federal administration seeking to undercut the growth of small, minority-owned businesses in the solar industry. Illinois can step up. Don’t let EECs go out of business, putting contractors that now have their feet in the door out of work. Pass CRGA!”

Joe Duffy, Executive Director, Climate Jobs Illinois: “The Clean and Reliable Grid Affordability Act is a clear example of what’s possible when labor, industry, and advocates come together with a shared goal — delivering affordable, reliable, and clean energy for all Illinoisans. This legislation not only tackles rising energy costs but ensures that the transition to a cleaner grid supports good union jobs and strengthens communities across our state. It’s a partnership that keeps Illinois leading the way on both climate and equity.”

This is a positive step in both moving away from dirty fuel sources like coal, oil, and gas as well as attempting to reduce nuclear waste.
Nuclear energy is the largest source of low-carbon power in the U.S.
The role of nuclear energy is a complex one in the evolving landscape of the clean energy transition.
World Nuclear News quoted Idaho National Laboratory director John Wagner as saying, ""INL has always been where nuclear innovation becomes reality.","The first Aurora powerhouse aims to offer clean, reliable, and affordable energy.

Nuclear energy company Oklo broke ground to build its first Aurora powerhouse at the Idaho National Laboratory. World Nuclear News described this new technology as a ""fast neutron reactor that uses heat pipes to transport heat from the reactor core to a supercritical carbon dioxide power conversion system to generate electricity.""

According to Bloomberg, Oklo hopes to have an Aurora powerhouse up and running by mid-2026.

The Aurora powerhouse is unique in that it can run off either fresh high-assay, low-enriched uranium or used fuel, which will make it the ""first fuel-recycling commercial reactor"" in the U.S., per Grist.

This is a positive step in both moving away from dirty fuel sources like coal, oil, and gas as well as attempting to reduce nuclear waste. Nuclear energy is the largest source of low-carbon power in the U.S.

The role of nuclear energy is a complex one in the evolving landscape of the clean energy transition. Nuclear reactors like the Aurora powerhouse can produce large amounts of low-carbon electricity and support energy security. They can also complement renewable energy sources that may not always be consistent, like wind and solar.

However, the risks involved with radioactive waste, safety concerns of working or living near the reactors, high upfront costs, and potential links to nuclear plants being used to subsidize or create nuclear weapons, or at least otherwise contribute to proliferation, are undeniably a major cause for concern.

No matter which side of the debate you fall on, it can only be seen as a positive that initiatives like the Aurora powerhouse aim to recycle nuclear waste, rather than relying on mining more of this precious and finite resource.

World Nuclear News quoted Idaho National Laboratory director John Wagner as saying, ""INL has always been where nuclear innovation becomes reality. Today's groundbreaking with Oklo continues that legacy, bringing advanced reactor technology from the laboratory to commercial deployment right here in Idaho.""",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/x6fRSqs2RJP91yu9t3.uMw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03OTc7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_cool_down_737/598edbef572fd9b9173e59e9eeb95acf,N,,2025-10-28 15:00:53.290578

Each demonstrates that affordable, reliable, and clean energy can coexist when states embrace balanced, pro-growth energy policies.

Without this proper balance, California’s energy system risks leaving families exposed to soaring costs and failing infrastructure.","Energy grids, like a balanced diet, need a healthy mix of ingredients to function properly. You would not feed your kids only lettuce and expect them to thrive. Yet California is doing just that with its energy system, cutting out petroleum, natural gas, and nuclear power without a reliable plan to meet consumer demand.

In recent weeks, energy experts have warned about a growing crisis in California’s oil infrastructure. Industry engineers say that the state’s crude pipelines, which carry heavy oil, are approaching a tipping point. Without steady production to keep the crude in motion, the pipelines could soon clog. Once that happens, the infrastructure will be too damaged to restart easily, leaving refineries without supply and consumers facing even higher costs.

The problem is not technical, but political. California now ranks among the most expensive states in the nation for energy. That is because politics, not markets, are determining how energy is produced and delivered.

Since 2019, California has reduced new oil drilling permits by 97%, effectively freezing in-state production. Regulatory barriers have delayed or blocked critical infrastructure projects, including storage and pipeline upgrades. At the same time, the state continues to retire baseload and dispatchable power sources such as nuclear and natural gas plants faster than reliable replacements are coming online.

The Golden State’s heavy reliance on intermittent renewables such as wind and solar creates major reliability gaps when the sun sets or the wind stalls. The results are predictable: rising costs, rolling blackouts, and growing dependence on imported energy.

According to the EIA, the average residential retail electricity price in California rose from just over 21 cents per kWh in 2013 to nearly 30 cents per kWh in 2023, an average annual increase of approximately 2.8% in real terms. With rates often in the range of 30 cents per kWh or more, California families are paying nearly double the national average of around 15–17 cents per kWh. With the average American home using about 29.37 kWh of electricity per day, that means California families are paying over $3,200 per year for basic needs like heating and cooling, water heating, refrigeration, and lighting. These high rates compound the risks tied to an unbalanced grid.

California and other states need to know there is a better way forward. The Affordable, Reliable, and Clean Energy Security Act, a model approved by members of the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), provides a clear roadmap for states seeking a sustainable energy future.

This framework emphasizes affordability first, requiring energy to be stable, predictable, and cost-effective for families and businesses. It also maintains an improved standard for “clean” energy, including nuclear and natural gas, without compromising the stability of the grid or picking winners and losers in the energy market.

States like Louisiana, Ohio, and Tennessee have implemented many of these reforms in recent years. Louisiana holds the lowest average retail electricity price at roughly 9 cents per kWh, thanks to a diverse mix of natural gas, nuclear, and renewables. Ohio’s balanced energy portfolio—anchored by natural gas and supported by market competition—keeps prices near 12 cents per kWh, below the national average. Tennessee benefits from abundant nuclear and hydropower, maintaining rates under 12 cents per kWh while cutting emissions. Each demonstrates that affordable, reliable, and clean energy can coexist when states embrace balanced, pro-growth energy policies.

For California, adopting a similar approach could help the Golden State finally stabilize its grid.

Nuclear, natural gas, and other dispatchable sources remain critical to keeping lights on and pipelines flowing. Responsible integration of renewables ensures can help supplement, rather than replace, these essential sources. Without this proper balance, California’s energy system risks leaving families exposed to soaring costs and failing infrastructure.",https://www.dailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/LDN-L-NEWSOM-FUELED-0926-DM01-1.jpg?w=1024&h=748,N,,2025-10-28 16:01:11.457516

The October edition of the MPSC’s monthly podcast Behind the Meter takes on a significant and timely topic: ensuring Michigan’s energy grid is prepared as more people choose to drive an electric vehicle.

Podcast host Mike Byrne, the MPSC’s Chief Operating Officer, leads a discussion with Commissioner Katherine Peretick and Michigan Chief Climate Officer Alessandra Carreon, a former MPSC commissioner.

They discuss the impact of electrification on the grid for new uses such as charging EVs at homes, businesses and other facilities, efforts to expand the number of charging stations across the state, the difference between fast chargers and slower chargers typical for residential charging, comparisons between the costs of owning and operating EVs compared to gas-powered automobiles, and more.

Peretick and Carreon also tell their own experiences as EV owners.

Peretick notes that most EV owners do the bulk of their vehicle charging while parked at home, and how the electric grid benefits by shifting electric usage to overnight. Even so, she’s seen a significant expansion of the number of public chargers available over three years she’s owned her Ford Mustang Mach-E, which has taken her as far as Chicago from her home in metro Detroit without needing to stop to charge.

“It’s a different mental shift when you have an electric vehicle,” Peretick says. “Most of my ‘filling up’ happens in my garage. Well over 80% of charging happens in my garage vs. public charging. I only need to stop at a public charger if I’m going on a really long trip.”

Solar power purchase agreement prices in North America rose 4% from the second to third quarter of 2025, while wind prices rose nearly 5%, according to data from the LevelTen Energy PPA marketplace. Wind PPAs have increased nearly 14% since last year.

Market analysts disagree about which specific policies have driven the increase in costs. LevelTen Energy attributes the rise to tariffs and permitting challenges, while energy transition firm Trio blames financing costs. Both say demand growth has played a role.

Additional rounds of tariffs announced by the Trump administration could increase PPA costs by another 10% to 15%, according to Joey Lange, senior managing director for clean energy supply at Trio.

Dive Insight:

With multiple policies poised to increase energy costs, it’s unclear exactly which factors are driving up PPA prices.

Wind PPAs have seen the greatest price hikes since the election of President Donald Trump, rising a little over $9/MWh since the third quarter of 2024, according to LevelTen Energy. The average solar PPA costs $3.19/MWh more than it did this time last year.

Developers of both resources have reported to LevelTen Energy that they’ve sidelined projects they don’t believe will make the deadline for federal tax incentives under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, according to Rob Collier, vice president of the LevelTen Energy marketplace. That has reduced the number of clean energy projects on the market, even as many large buyers have sped up their procurement ahead of those same OBBBA deadlines, Collier said.

Wind projects face additional price pressure from newly restrictive federal permitting policies, Collier said. Wind is also seen as more desirable by corporate procurement teams looking to meet 24-7 clean energy goals, according to Lange.

But tariffs have had the biggest cost impact to date, Collier said.

“What we’re hearing from developers is it’s the tariffs,” he said. “Metal, minerals, new inquiries into wind turbine components — that is what is creating uncertainty and upward pressure on pricing.”

Lange is less convinced that tariffs are the primary factor driving current cost increases. Most recent PPAs have addressed the potential for new tariffs with riders that increase the cost of the contract if and when tariffs take effect, he said. Because developers may not include those riders in initial asking prices, they may not factor into averages based on current market bids.

New tariffs that have yet to take effect — and so haven’t triggered contract riders — stand to increase wind and solar PPA prices 10% to 15%, Lange said.

Increased financing costs, however, have already impacted PPA prices and are the main force behind increases to date, according to Lange. The crush of developers trying to bring projects to market ahead of the OBBBA deadlines — coupled with numerous other infrastructure projects, including data centers, that are trying to rush to market — has strained U.S. financiers. The growing competition for capital has increased borrowing costs, Lange said.

Despite the increasing costs, the value of most PPAs relative to wholesale energy prices has improved in recent months, Lange said.

Even so, neither Lange nor Collier expects PPA prices to decline in the near future.

With the supply of tax credit-qualified projects likely to dwindle toward the middle of next year, “it’s hard to envision a world where prices are going to decrease,” Collier said. The open question, he said, is whether prices increase gradually, or spike suddenly as the OBBBA and tariff policies take hold.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/HA0rxk7UES26k7Pw1ziqXWtRa-bwCn2IVW7k9rn2FrM/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy05NDE1NTA4My5qcGc=.webp,N,,2025-10-28 14:04:33.984963

Together, these vehicles have logged more than 20 million zero-tailpipe-emission miles, eliminating an estimated 34,000 metric tons of CO₂—the equivalent of taking more than 7,000 passenger cars off the road for a full year1.

These North American results contribute to Volvo Trucks’ global momentum in heavy-duty electrification. Since launching its first electric trucks in 2019, Volvo has delivered more than 5,700 electric vehicles across 50 countries, which have collectively driven 250 million kilometers (155 million miles). Volvo Trucks continues to hold a leading position globally and has maintained an average of over 30% market share in the North American electric truck segment over the past five years.

“Reaching this milestone is a testament to our customers’ commitment to sustainable transportation and our dealer network’s dedication to supporting them every step of the way,” said Peter Voorhoeve, president, Volvo Trucks North America. “The path to zero emissions is shaped by market conditions, which are moving slowly. We remain committed to our vision to create a world we want to live in by using zero emissions solutions in combination with fuel efficient combustion engines with reduced climate impact. Solutions that will work for our clients where sustainability meets affordability.”

83 Certified EV dealerships across North America

Since TEC Equipment – Fontana became the first Volvo Trucks Certified EV Dealer in July 2021, the network has expanded rapidly to 83 certified locations across 33 U.S. states and four Canadian provinces. The latest additions bring four new states—Colorado, Louisiana, Maryland, and Nevada—and four new dealer groups into the program. Another 13 locations are currently in the certification pipeline.

Certified dealers complete extensive EV training and invest in facility upgrades to deliver full sales and service support for battery-electric trucks.

Cutting CO₂ Across All Drivelines

Volvo Trucks is advancing cleaner and more efficient solutions across its entire product range. In North America, the all-new Volvo VNL delivers up to 10% better fuel efficiency than its predecessor. For a truck running 120,000 miles per year, that translates to about 1,300 fewer gallons of fuel and a reduction of roughly 30,000 pounds of CO₂.

Fuel-efficient combustion engines that can also run on renewable fuels are one part of Volvo Trucks’ three-path approach to decarbonization—together with battery-electric and fuel-cell electric trucks.

These models include the Volvo FL Electric, FE Electric, FM Electric, FM Low Entry, FMX Electric, FH Electric, FH Aero Electric, and the VNR Electric.

How it all started…

Volvo Trucks’ leadership in zero-tailpipe emission transportation began with the launch of the Volvo VNR Electric as part of the pioneering Volvo LIGHTS Project. The $90 million public-private partnership laid the foundation for the widespread adoption of heavy-duty battery-electric trucks by exploring the infrastructure and operational adaptations required to support electromobility. Volvo Trucks is also a key partner in California’s Joint Electric Truck Scaling Initiative (JETSI), which deployed Class 8 battery-electric trucks across Southern California to demonstrate strategies to successfully scale market penetration of zero emission technologies.

In a dynamic and rapidly changing world, we must work together to integrate landscape protection at every level, across Europe and beyond.”

The conference highlighted how the implementation of the Landscape Convention could enhance the recognition of landscape quality as an essential resource for safeguarding human rights and addressing the triple planetary crises of pollution, climate change and loss of biodiversity on human rights, democracy, and the rule of law.

Organised by the Council of Europe and the Ministry of Culture of Italy, the event was opened by the Minister of Culture, Alessandro Giuli. Other speakers included the Italian Minister of the Environment and Energy Security, Gilberto Pichetto Fratin (pre-recorded statement), the Parliamentary Assembly member Senator Aurora Floridia and the President of the Congress of Local and Regional Authorities Marc Cools (pre-recorded statement).

Sierra Nevada National Park recognised

During the event, the European Diploma for protected areas was awarded to the Sierra Nevada National Park, Nature Park, and Biosphere Reserve in Spain.

Congratulating Francisco de Asís Muñoz Collado, the Director of the park, who was present in Florence to accept the diploma, the Deputy Secretary General said that Sierra Nevada becomes the fifth Spanish national park to join the club of 67 holders of the European Diploma for protected areas. “Preventing extinctions – revitalising habitats – protecting biodiversity – these principles are what this diploma is all about.”

Commitment to more effective implementation of landscape protection

A final declaration has been adopted by participants outlining a strategic vision to strengthening multilateral cooperation and promoting the effective implementation of the convention and its integration in national policies. Participants also reaffirmed the pivotal role of the convention and outline its future direction in line with the Reykjavik Declaration, while also serving to implement the Council of Europe Strategy on the environment.

“Today, ensuring the security of our landscapes is more important and pressing than ever. Climate change brings with it extreme weather events and fundamental changes to our ecosystem. These, alongside increases in pollution and land degradation, all leading to loss of biodiversity. We must both adapt to these challenges and work to mitigate their effects, in both our urban and country landscapes,” Mr Berge said.

“Much of the know-how and production for sodium-ion batteries is concentrated in China [and] initial deployment of new-generation sodium-ion products will continue to be in China,” Stoikou said.
Sodium-ion batteries also hold their charge better in very cold conditions, making them more efficient year-round in northern climates, Mossburg said.","Last month, on the high prairie east of its hometown, Denver-based Peak Energy powered up what it says is the United States’ first grid-scale sodium-ion battery installation and “the first ever fully passive megawatt-hour scale battery storage system” anywhere in the world.

Peak’s 3.5-MWh project marks a big step forward for the electrochemical battery chemistry that many experts believe is the most viable challenger to lithium-ion, which today dominates the energy storage market for discharge durations shorter than four hours.

“What’s nice about our technology is the way it looks and feels to a customer is like a new variant of a [lithium-ion battery] system,” said Landon Mossburg, CEO and cofounder of Peak Energy.

Sodium-ion batteries’ allure is growing amid volatile commodity pricing and an on-again, off-again trade war between the United States and China affecting lithium-ion batteries.

Sodium-ion storage has a simpler supply chain that eschews traditional battery metals, said Evelina Stoikou, an energy storage analyst with BloombergNEF. The U.S. has the world’s largest known reserves of soda ash, a sodium precursor that is more abundant globally than lithium, nickel and cobalt.

“Lithium-ion costs remain highly sensitive to raw material prices, meaning that spikes in lithium, nickel, or cobalt prices could improve sodium-ion’s relative competitiveness,” she said.

But Stoikou cautioned that swingy raw materials pricing can cut in the other direction. At the moment, rapidly-falling LFP costs are driving a boom in global lithium battery deployments.

“Expectations among [sodium-ion battery] manufacturers have cooled as LFP prices continue to trend downward, leading to a reduction in our expectations for sodium-ion to scale,” she said.

Sodium-ion proponents like Peak Energy believe sodium-ion chemistry, though less energy-dense than lithium, has inherent advantages that will allow it to compete on cost before the decade is done. Those include lower fire risk, higher discharge rates, more efficient thermal management and better performance in extreme hot and cold conditions. Mossburg estimates his batteries cost 20% less to operate over 20 years than an equivalent lithium-ion system.

China charges ahead on sodium-ion

As debate rages over sodium-ion batteries’ place in the global energy mix, sodium-ion battery manufacturers and developers are moving forward — particularly in China.

In fact, Peak’s groundbreaking Colorado installation also looks puny next to recent sodium-ion deployments in the world’s second-largest economy. One Chinese state-owned power company is developing a 100 MW/200 MWh installation. Another recently commissioned a 200 MW/400 MWh hybrid sodium/lithium facility that it says reduces system costs by 30% over a sodium-ion-only equivalent. Industry analysts and insiders credit the advancements to the Chinese government’s supply-side subsidies and product standardization.

“Much of the know-how and production for sodium-ion batteries is concentrated in China [and] initial deployment of new-generation sodium-ion products will continue to be in China,” Stoikou said.

China’s sodium-ion push is reminiscent of its decade-long strategy to dominate the market for lithium-ion battery precursors, materials and components. Its head start leads some Western analysts and entrepreneurs to conclude that China will also dominate the sodium-ion battery market, at least for grid-scale energy storage applications.

Others, including Peak Energy, are making a different bet. As production scales up in China and eventually the United States, they expect sodium-based battery producers to carve out a sizable share of the rapidly-growing stationary storage market worldwide — not only in China. BloombergNEF expects global stationary storage capacity to grow 12-fold over the next 10 years.

High-profile failures sow doubts in U.S. market

Clouding that optimistic vision is the recent failure of Natron Energy. The once high-flying sodium-ion battery startup folded in September, barely a year after announcing plans to build a $1.4 billion, 14-GW manufacturing facility in North Carolina. It was the second U.S. sodium-ion company to go bankrupt in 2025. Stanford University spinout Bedrock Materials closed in April, citing technical and market challenges.

Yet even sodium-ion skeptics like Stanford University scientist Adrian Yao, lead author on a widely-cited January paper questioning the technology’s near-term commercial potential, warn against reading too much into Natron’s failure. Yao told IEEE Spectrumearlier this month that Natron may have been too early to its chosen niche: high-powered, short-duration batteries for data centers and large industrial facilities.

“Hyperscalers right now, their primary concern is just getting connected and building data centers,” he said. “I think timing on that cycle may be early.”

Where ‘sodium excels’

According to Unigrid cofounder and CEO Darren Tan, less energy-dense but higher-power sodium battery modules are indeed better suited to shorter-duration applications. Those include backup and demand response for commercial and industrial users, a niche Natron aimed to fill with its first products.

“Fifteen to 60 minutes is the real market now — that’s where lithium struggles and sodium excels,” Tan said in an interview.

Isshu Kikuma, another BloombergNEF energy storage analyst, said in an email that steadily falling prices mean lithium-ion batteries are now cost-competitive at durations of six to eight hours in some geographies. For years, energy storage experts have expected flow batteries — whose active ingredients are typically petroleum-based or metals heavier than lithium and sodium — and more novel technologies to dominate durations longer than four or five hours.

That’s one reason Tan believes sodium-ion is not in a position to challenge lithium-ion in grid-scale stationary storage. He also blames China’s head start on commercialization and its ruthlessly competitive clean tech culture, which drives prices far below levels Western manufacturers can match.

“If sodium is ever cheaper than lithium, it will be the Chinese who win, same as today,” he said.

At least in the near term, Unigrid is focusing on opportunities outside the world of stationary storage. For example, Tan said Unigrid’s power cell batteries are ideal drop-in replacements for traditional lead-acid car starters — a $15 billion opportunity, he said.

“That’s an existing market, not a projected one,” Tan said, alluding to the fact that sodium batteries’ grid-scale storage potential remains largely untested.

In the longer run, Tan said sodium-ion chemistry could eat into lithium’s dominance in behind-the-meter storage at shorter durations.

Because they’re less energy-dense, sodium-ion batteries have a lower risk of thermal runaway, the electrochemical process that can lead to battery fires like the January conflagration that consumed a 300-MW battery array on the central California coast. With encouragement from Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin, communities around the country have tightened restrictions on lithium-based energy storage or frozen their development entirely since the fire at the Moss Landing energy facility.

“Commercial businesses, data centers, residences in urban environments — these are areas where safety is important,” Tan said.

Peak Energy says its time has come

Peak Energy’s Mossburg has a different view. He believes a particular variety of sodium-ion battery can compete at utility scales and that price parity with lithium will come sooner than the skeptics expect.

The active cathode ingredient in the batteries at Peak Energy’s Colorado facility is sodium pyrophosphate, or NFPP. In an interview, Mossburg said Chinese investment flows this year indicate NFPP chemistry is edging out other sodium-ion varieties in the world’s biggest battery market, likely lifting U.S.-based NFPP developers.

“Most of the investment is happening in NFPP, which wasn’t clear when we made the call,” Mossburg said.

In a July press release, Peak Energy touted its passively-cooled batteries’ advantages over lithium-iron-phosphate chemistry, or LFP. LFP is the lithium-ion variant that accounts for most stationary storage facilities being built today.

One big advantage is a 90% reduction in auxiliary power use — a direct benefit of passive cooling. Grid-scale LFP batteries draw significant amounts of power to run the active cooling systems needed to prevent thermal runaway, reducing their cost-effectiveness. Peak says the difference can save operators $1 million or more per year, per GW.

Peak also says its batteries are more durable, degrading 33% more slowly over a projected 20-year lifespan. All told, lifetime costs come in 20% lower than comparable LFP systems, Peak says.

In hot climates with more intense cooling loads for LFP batteries, Mossburg said NFPP operators could save $5/kWh to $10/kWh. Sodium-ion batteries also hold their charge better in very cold conditions, making them more efficient year-round in northern climates, Mossburg said.

Mossburg said his batteries’ performance advantages are winning over risk-averse customers seeking competitive returns on energy equipment. He said the company plans to announce new customers soon.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/45mKYLbHOsoLenWYQWHJcxobCLbJ-QgWBygtGYHHKDo/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9QZWFrX0VuZXJneV9zb2RpdW0taW9uX3N0b3JhZ2UuanBn.webp,N,,2025-10-28 14:04:29.118347

The removal of fines for non-compliance with emissions standards has also removed the market for selling carbon emissions credits to other automakers.
This is because all battery cells procured for its stationary storage products are sourced from China while the company works on alternative sources, Taneja said.
There was also some discussion of the proposed US$1 trillion pay package that Musk will receive contingent upon Tesla meeting specific performance targets.
Tesla board chair Robyn Denholm sent a letter to shareholders yesterday (27 October), on behalf of fellow board members and the company’s executive directors, urging shareholders to greenlight the proposals.","Of the quarterly total, US$3.4 billion came from energy generation and storage, versus US$21.2 billion from Tesla’s automotive segment.

According to the company’s Form 10Q filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), for the nine months ending 30 September 2025, both total revenues and profits fell year-on-year, however.

Total revenue fell 2.9% from US$72 billion in January-September 2024 to US$69.9 billion for the equivalent period this year, and gross profit by 9%, from US$13.27 billion to US$12.09 billion.

As reported by our colleagues at EV Infrastructure News (EVIN), Tesla’s profitability took a hit due to higher operating costs and lower regulatory credit income in the US, offsetting the impact of a rush to buy EVs before US tax credits expired at the end of September.

US trade tariffs caused a rise in manufacturing costs, although the company said it was “difficult to measure the impacts of shifting global trade and fiscal policies” on vehicle sales. The removal of fines for non-compliance with emissions standards has also removed the market for selling carbon emissions credits to other automakers.

Within its energy generation and storage division, however, revenues grew 27% year-on-year between the first nine months of each year, and despite a 21% increase in the cost of revenues, gross profit was US$2.7 billion in the segment, with a gross margin of 30.3%, up from US$1.87 billion and a 26.6% gross margin last year.

Gross margin for the reported quarter in the energy division was 31.4% due to a gross profit of US$1.07 billion, compared to 17% gross margin for automotive and 18% gross margin overall.

Megapack 4 to ‘incorporate a lot of what is normally in a substation’

During the quarter, Tesla launched Megablock, which features Megapack 3, the newest iteration of the company’s Megapack utility-scale BESS solution. Megablock allows users to put four 5MWh Megapack 3 units together to create a 20MWh solution, with Tesla claiming a site-level density of 248MWh AC-per-acre on its launch in September during the RE+ trade show in Las Vegas.

CEO Elon Musk said in an earnings call to explain results that Tesla has “exciting plans for Megapack 4,” which he said will “incorporate a lot of what is normally in a substation,” able to output at “probably 35kV directly”.

“So, this greatly improves our ability to deploy Megapack because it’s not dependent on building a substation up through 35 kV for Megapack 4,” Musk said, calling this “the engineering priority for Megapack.”

Michael Snyder, Tesla VP of energy and charging, said demand for Megapack and the residential Powerwall battery storage system “continues to be really strong into next year.”

Snyder claimed the company had already received “very strong positive customer feedback on our Megablock product, which will begin shipping next year out of Houston.”

As is becoming a common theme in the industry of late, Snyder said Tesla foresaw potential demand for large-scale battery storage arising from AI and data centre applications, “as hyperscalers and utilities have seen the versatility of the Megapack product to increase reliability and receive—and relieve grid constraints.”

However, as Tesla CFO Vaibhav Taneja pointed out, while the energy storage business delivered record deployments, gross profit and margins in the third quarter, the segment sees a bigger percentage of cost of goods sold (COGS) impact from tariffs than its automotive division.

This is because all battery cells procured for its stationary storage products are sourced from China while the company works on alternative sources, Taneja said. The ramp-up of its recently opened Megafactory in Shanghai, China, which makes the grid-scale systems for delivery to non-US customers, is helping the company reduce its exposure to tariffs, Taneja said. The company said in its previous results release that it will start lithium iron phosphate (LFP) cell production in the US, expected to commence before the end of this year.

The overall tariff impact on quarterly revenues was in excess of US$400 million, the CFO said, generally split evenly between EVs and BESS.

Vote on Musk’s remuneration imminent

The earnings call focused mainly on the automotive segment, including full self-driving and Tesla’s Robotaxi offerings, while self-styled Tesla ‘Technoking’ Musk’s own comments emphasised activities in the AI space and the humanoid robot the company is developing.

There was also some discussion of the proposed US$1 trillion pay package that Musk will receive contingent upon Tesla meeting specific performance targets. Shareholders will vote on the package in a few days, with voting closing at 11.59pm ET on 5 November, ahead of the Annual Meeting the next day.

The package would include an equity award, which would vest after 7.5 and 10 years based on whether Tesla’s market cap—currently at around a trillion-and-a-half dollars—goes beyond US$2 trillion, on a sliding scale up to US$8.5 trillion.

CFO Taneja said the meeting would “shape the future of Tesla,” and said the board requested that shareholders “support Elon’s leadership” through the two compensation proposals on the table, as well as endorse the re-election of three board members, Ihra Ehrenpreis, Kathleen Wilson-Thompson and Joe Gebbia.

However, the compensation package would not only richly reward Musk financially if 12 targets are met, but would also allow the CEO to retain the control he claimed he should have: “but not so much that I can’t be fired if I go insane,” he said.

The CEO said something about not wanting to “build a robot army and then be ousted” over recommendations from the likes of ISS and Glass Lewis, two proxy advisory firms on corporate governance, which Musk went on to describe as “corporate terrorists”.

Both have been vocal in recommending that shareholders vote against the pay package, which was put in place after a 2018 deal was recently struck down in a Delaware court as “deeply flawed.” ISS and Glass Lewis said the deal would be excessive, dilute shareholder value and would not align with long-term investor interests.

Tesla board chair Robyn Denholm sent a letter to shareholders yesterday (27 October), on behalf of fellow board members and the company’s executive directors, urging shareholders to greenlight the proposals.

“When negotiating this performance award, we necessarily considered what Tesla’s future without Elon would look like, and we did not believe it was the future that our shareholders deserve,” Denholm wrote.

“At a time when companies—both big and small—are competing to be the first to bring groundbreaking AI technologies to market, we could not risk losing the best leader in the industry to put Tesla on top. Now is a pivotal moment for our company to emerge as a leader in AI, and with our exceptional CEO at the helm, we are perfectly positioned to seize it.”

However, the views of shareholders submitted to the SEC this week varied. The State Board of Administration of Florida (SBA) said it would vote ‘yes’, citing the benefits to investors in terms of value creation if the plan’s metrics are met.

On the other hand, New York State Common Retirement Fund trustee Thomas DiNapoli, the state comptroller for New York, said he was “deeply concerned about the continued entrenchment, weak governance, and lack of accountability at Tesla,” and said the board was operating with “an alarming lack of independence.”

DiNapoli said the board of directors, including the three members up for re-election had “consistently allowed CEO Musk’s inattention to corporate affairs and his unpredictable and highly public actions to damage Tesla’s reputation, operational stability, and investor confidence,” while also citing the company’s volatile share performance over the past year—plummeting from highs of US$488 in December 2024 to US$222 per share in March—and declining EV market share among reasons to vote down the compensation package and re-elections.

The report estimates that $350 million, mostly in federal tax credits, went to about 30,000 Vermonters in 2025, with $65 million of that being enhanced credits.
It's expected that more people will turn to the emergency room for health care, driving up the cost for everyone else.
""I will not vote to substantially raise health care costs in Vermont for tens of thousands of people.
I won't just stand by and support their plans to rip away health care from millions.","MONTPELIER – A new report from a nonpartisan, nonprofit group says Vermonters will be hit particularly hard should the health insurance tax credits at the heart of the ongoing government shutdown dispute be allowed to expire.

Public Assets Institute released a report last week saying up to 30,000 Vermonters will see their premiums increase dramatically at the beginning of the year if the credits end.

The information in the report largely comes from the Department for Health Access and KFF, the latter being a national health care organization formerly known as The Kaiser Family Foundation, said Stephanie Yu, executive director of Public Assets Institute.

""There's a lot of people who are really scared about what the January bill is going to look like, because we're talking crazy numbers,"" Yu said.

According to the report, released Friday, Vermont's health care exchange was created in 2014 as required by the Affordable Care Act passed by the federal government four years earlier. People using the exchange get federal premium tax credits based on the cost of the base silver plan, and their income.

In 2021, because of the pandemic, the American Rescue Plan Act boosted the premium tax credits and expanded who was eligible for them for the years 2021 and 2022. The Inflation Reduction Act then extended these until 2025, according to the report.

Under the enhancement, the full cost of the silver benchmark premium is covered for people making less than 150% of the federal poverty level. People making between 150% and 400% of the federal poverty have it partially covered, while people earning more than 400% also get some assistance.

According to the report, Vermont offers some assistance to those under 300% of the federal poverty level, and helps with out-of-pocket costs as well.

The report estimates that $350 million, mostly in federal tax credits, went to about 30,000 Vermonters in 2025, with $65 million of that being enhanced credits. The state provided $6.2 million. About a third of the people getting credits were between 55 and 64 years in age.

""Over 90 percent of exchange participants qualify for federal subsidies, and about a third receive the additional state support,"" reads the report. ""The average federal credit for Vermonters is $11,400. That's a big increase over 2015, before the enhanced credits took effect. Then, 22,500 Vermont recipients received an average credit of $3,300. Much of the increase occurred in 2024 and 2025, after the temporary pandemic expansion of Medicaid ended.""

Everyone receiving credits will end up paying more should the enhanced credits expire, according to the Public Assets Institute. People under 400% of the federal poverty level will see between 0.5% and 4.6% increase, while those over 400% will be paying the full cost of the premium.

""Because Vermont has the highest premiums in the country and some of the fastest growth in costs in recent years, Vermonters will be hit particularly hard,"" reads the report, stating that a person making $63,000 a year will be paying $15,000 for health care premiums while a family of four at the same place above the poverty level would see a $30,000 per year increase.

Yu said that when the credits were enacted, there was an increase in enrollment, meaning it's likely that many will forgo health coverage altogether. It's expected that more people will turn to the emergency room for health care, driving up the cost for everyone else.

""Right now the state provides additional premium assistance to everybody under 300% of the poverty level,"" said Yu. ""They could take that level up, either get rid of the limit or take it higher and temporarily fill in for the enhanced credits.""

This could cost Vermont about $65 million annually, said Yu, a big number but not an undoable one.

""Although we've also got SNAP and Medicaid cuts coming, so there's not going to be any shortage of demands,"" she said.

Cuts to Medicaid are in the ""Big Beautiful Bill Act,"" while the current shutdown is impacting the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP). The Legislature and the Scott administration have announced they plan to find a way to fund SNAP through November, and make sure LIHEAP is available.

Earlier this month, U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders stated that should the enhanced tax credits be allowed to lapse then Vermonters would see their health care costs rise substantially.

""I will not vote to substantially raise health care costs in Vermont for tens of thousands of people. I will not vote to throw 45,000 Vermonters off of their health care. That's what the shutdown debate is all about,"" Sanders stated.

U.S. Sen. Peter Welch released a similar statement, saying millions of people across the country will find their health care costs are unaffordable should the tax credits not be extended.

""Republicans once again chose to turn their back on Americans' health care. If they wanted to keep the government open, they would have returned to DC and taken a seat at the negotiating table with Democrats to protect health care for working Americans. I won't just stand by and support their plans to rip away health care from millions. This is not what the American people want,"" stated Congresswoman Becca Balint in a release at the end of September, as the government shut down.

National media reports on Monday indicate the shutdown isn't likely to end soon.

He wrote his 17-page memo hoping to have an impact on next month’s United Nations climate change conference in Brazil.
Gates, whose foundation provides financial support for Associated Press coverage of health and development in Africa, is influential in the climate change conversation.
He expects his “tough truths about climate” memo will be controversial.
At the same time, money to help developing countries adapt to climate change is shrinking.","NEW YORK (AP) — Bill Gates thinks climate change is a serious problem but it won’t be the end of civilization. He thinks scientific innovation will curb it, and it’s instead time for a “strategic pivot” in the global climate fight: from focusing on limiting rising temperatures to fighting poverty and preventing disease.

A doomsday outlook has led the climate community to focus too much on near-term goals to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that cause warming, diverting resources from the most effective things that can be done to improve life in a warming world, Gates said. In a memo released Tuesday, Gates said the world’s primary goal should instead be to prevent suffering, particularly for those in the toughest conditions in the world’s poorest countries.

If given a choice between eradicating malaria and a tenth of a degree increase in warming, Gates told reporters, “I’ll let the temperature go up 0.1 degree to get rid of malaria. People don’t understand the suffering that exists today.”

The Microsoft co-founder spends most of his time now on the goals of the Gates Foundation, which has poured tens of billions of dollars into health care, education and development initiatives worldwide, including combating HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. He started Breakthrough Energy in 2015 to speed up innovation in clean energy.

He wrote his 17-page memo hoping to have an impact on next month’s United Nations climate change conference in Brazil. He’s urging world leaders to ask whether the little money designated for climate is being spent on the right things.

Gates, whose foundation provides financial support for Associated Press coverage of health and development in Africa, is influential in the climate change conversation. He expects his “tough truths about climate” memo will be controversial.

“If you think climate is not important, you won’t agree with the memo. If you think climate is the only cause and apocalyptic, you won’t agree with the memo,” Gates said during a roundtable discussion with reporters ahead of the release. “It’s kind of this pragmatic view of somebody who’s, you know, trying to maximize the money and the innovation that goes to help in these poor countries.”

Climate scientists say every fraction of a degree of warming matters

Every bit of additional warming correlates to more extreme weather, risks species extinction and brings the world closer to crossing tipping points where changes become irreversible, scientists say.

University of Washington public health and climate scientist Kristie Ebi said she thoroughly agrees with Gates that the U.N. negotiations should focus on improving human health and well-being. But, she said, Gates assumes the world stays static and only one variable changes — faster deployment of green technologies — to curb climate change. She called that unlikely.

Jeffrey Sachs, director of the Center for Sustainable Development at Columbia University, called the memo “pointless, vague, unhelpful and confusing.”

“There is no reason to pit poverty reduction versus climate transformation. Both are utterly feasible, and readily so, if the Big Oil lobby is brought under control,” he wrote in an email.

Stanford University climate scientist Chris Field said there is room for a healthy discussion about whether the current framing of the climate crisis is typically too pessimistic.

“But we should also invest for both the long term and the short term,” he wrote in an email. “A vibrant long-term future depends on both tackling climate change and supporting human development.”

Princeton University climate scientist Michael Oppenheimer said he doesn’t dispute the principle of making human well-being the primary objective of policy, but what about the natural world?

“Climate change is already wreaking havoc there,” he wrote in an email. “Can we truly live in a technological bubble? Do we want to?”

Gates is clear in his memo that every tenth of a degree of warming matters: “A stable climate makes it easier to improve people’s lives.”

Carbon dioxide pollution is increasing

A decade ago, the world agreed in a historic pact known as the Paris agreement to try to limit human-caused warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) since pre-industrial times. The goal: to stave off nastier heat waves, wildfires, storms and droughts.

In a 2021 book, Gates laid out a plan for reducing emissions to avoid a climate disaster. But humans are on track to release so much greenhouse gas by early 2028 that scientists say crossing that 1.5-degree threshold is now nearly unavoidable.

Breakthrough Energy focuses on areas where the cost of doing something cleanly is much higher than the polluting way, such as making clean steel and cement. Gates concluded his memo by saying governments should work toward driving this difference to zero, and be rigorous about measuring the impact of every effort in the world’s climate agenda.

Gates is optimistic innovation will curb climate change

Gates said the pace of innovation in clean energy has been faster than he expected, allowing cheap solar and wind energy to replace coal, oil and natural gas plants for electricity and averting worst-case warming scenarios. Artificial intelligence is helping accelerate advances in clean energy technologies, he added.

At the same time, money to help developing countries adapt to climate change is shrinking. Led by the United States, rich countries are cutting their foreign aid budgets. President Donald Trump has called climate change a hoax.

Gates criticized the aid cuts. He said Gavi, a public-private partnership started by his philanthropic foundation that buys vaccines, will have 25% less money for the next five years compared to the past five years. Gavi can save a life for a little more than $1,000, he added.

Vaccines become even more important in a warming world because children who aren’t dying of measles or whooping cough will be more likely to survive when a heat wave hits or a drought threatens the local food supply, he wrote.

Health and prosperity are the best defense against climate change, Gates said, citing research from the University of Chicago Climate Impact Lab that found projected deaths from climate change fall by more than 50% when accounting for the expected economic growth over the rest of this century.

Under these circumstances, he thinks the bar must be “very high” for what’s funded with aid money.

“If you have something that gets rid of 10,000 tons of emissions, that you’re spending several million dollars on,” he said, “that just doesn’t make the cut.”

The gap spans critical fields such as engineering, project development, and technical installation.
“This imbalance points toward the urgent need for engineering automation tools to dramatically accelerate the output and effectiveness of the existing global engineering workforce,” says Paul Nel, CEO of 7SecondSolar.
“Computational tools like AutoPV can knock months off a project timeline for a utility-scale solar plant.
“The energy sector can no longer afford the months-long manual processes traditionally required for a single utility-scale project design,” Nel adds.","The global energy transition, despite massive investments in renewables, faces a major choke point, a worldwide shortage of skilled energy engineers.

According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), achieving Net Zero by 2050 will require the creation of 30 million new clean energy jobs by 2030, yet the world is projected to fall short by seven million skilled workers. The gap spans critical fields such as engineering, project development, and technical installation.

In the utility-scale solar sector alone, nearly USD 12 billion will be spent on design over the next five years, equivalent to around 12,000 work-years of engineering labour.

“This imbalance points toward the urgent need for engineering automation tools to dramatically accelerate the output and effectiveness of the existing global engineering workforce,” says Paul Nel, CEO of 7SecondSolar. “Computational tools like AutoPV can knock months off a project timeline for a utility-scale solar plant. Software like this can generate construction-ready outputs for multiple designs within hours, empowering engineers to focus on value optimisation rather than manual repetition,"" he noted.

The shortage is evident across global markets. South Africa has fewer than 40,000 registered professional engineers. In Germany, over 18,300 energy transition-related vacancies went unfilled in 2024. France must recruit 43,000 people by 2030 to modernise its grid, and Australia expects a deficit of 17,400 skilled energy workers.

This trend highlights a crucial truth, human capacity, not funding, is now the biggest bottleneck in renewable energy deployment.

By 2030, global installed solar PV capacity is projected to surpass 7 TW, accounting for roughly 65 percent of the 11 TW renewable energy target set at COP28. Meeting this demand will require not just more engineers, but smarter engineering through automation.

Another area needing urgent reform is the education pipeline. Research shows 68 percent of the world’s energy education programs still focus on fossil fuels, while only 32 percent cover renewable energy. As the balance tilts toward clean energy, universities must integrate computational design and automation tools into curricula to prepare engineers for modern project complexity.

“The energy sector can no longer afford the months-long manual processes traditionally required for a single utility-scale project design,” Nel adds. “Computational software must become the new baseline for engineering education and practice. Since adding seven million skilled engineers by 2030 is unrealistic, we must instead multiply the productivity of every single engineer, ensuring that projects remain both bankable and fast to deliver,"" he noted.",https://www.energetica-india.net/images/noticias/V0z5tQV74MN56tY4uiWmvF0oVYYhOLCjJ3d4HyyA46uRxdzJEkPDO.jpg,N,,2025-10-28 13:10:11.033827

The report, commissioned by the U.S. Department of Energy, investigated electricity price data between 2019 and 2024 to see which geographical, market and policy factors were the biggest influences on price changes for consumers. Adjusted for inflation, state-level average retail electricity prices actually decreased in most states, and electricity prices went down in states where electricity demand grew because fixed utility costs were spread over more customers. The Berkeley research’s findings should guide federal, state and local governments toward policies that will slow the growth of electricity bills while increasing the capacity and reliability of America’s electrical grid.

There are three big factors contributing to energy prices rising in America today:

Extreme weather disasters;

Aging grid infrastructure; and

State regulators pushing utilities to add solar and wind power while retiring natural gas, coal and nuclear power plants.

Natural disasters increase electricity prices through a combination of immediate recovery costs and the upgrades needed to reduce weather vulnerability over the long-term. In California, for example, investments to mitigate wildfire risks, obtain the necessary insurance and minimize liability costs have been “a significant driver of retail price increases.”

However, these grid investments are not just needed in areas experiencing more weather events. Berkeley Labs’ research emphasizes that the urgent need for grid upgrades is widespread and a major structural challenge across the U.S. power sector. The costs of upgrading and maintaining our aging grid, particularly the poles and wires used for distribution, are contributing to rising retail electricity prices. An article on the LBNL study by Shannon Osaka at The Washington Post called, “There’s a reason electricity prices have been rising. And it’s not data centers,” notes:

“The price of transformers and wires, for example, has far outpaced inflation over the past five years. At the same time, U.S. utilities haven’t been on top of replacing power poles and lines in the past, and are now trying to catch up. According to another report from Brattle, utilities are already spending more than $10 billion a year replacing aging transmission lines.”

Even when utilities seek regulatory approval to upgrade their grid infrastructure, green energy mandates from politicians have increased the cost and complexity. State mandates like Renewable Portfolio Standards require utilities to procure incremental renewable energy supplies, primarily from solar and wind. While these generation sources are less expensive to construct, they do not provide any power when the sun isn’t shining and the wind isn’t blowing, so supplemental power must be purchased from other utilities at prices higher than baseload power that’s always on. These additional electricity costs are in turn imposed on ratepayers.

Meanwhile, America’s tech industry is investing hundreds of billions across the country, building more data centers to meet growing consumer demand for cloud services and AI tools. Each time you take a video or photo on your phone, share with family and friends, send messages and emails or create a new document, you are increasing the need for more cloud storage in more data centers and the electricity to make it all happen. The same goes for cloud storage and applications used by businesses, governments and organizations, since we all use digital services to conduct our daily lives.

In the areas where data centers have been built up the most, they are actually pushing prices down for residential ratepayers. Grid upgrades and operating costs show on your utility bill as allocated “fixed costs” for generation and transmission. These modernization efforts, as noted above, are badly needed for the stability and reliability of our electrical grid. Enterprise data centers cover much of the cost of these grid upgrades, since state utility regulators are required to protect ratepayers from costs incurred to serve new large-load customers. Additionally, these upgrades help to decrease costs for local residents because new grid equipment is not as vulnerable to weather events. That’s why the Berkeley Labs research shows that data centers are actually helping to keep energy costs low for local residents in the communities they serve.

The best example of this is from Virginia, which has the largest concentration of data centers in the world. According to the Berkeley Lab study, statewide load grew 15% from 2019 to 2024, when many data centers came online in the area. This growth in usage of the grid “helped keep many other costs…flat on a nominal basis and declining in inflation-adjusted terms as fixed costs were spread over more load.” Where there have been price increases in Virginia, the study notes that increase is driven by the state’s environmental regulations and an increase in the price of fuel due to global events like the Ukraine-Russia war.

While nothing can be done to prevent weather disasters, utilities and policymakers can and should adopt new approaches to upgrade and harden America’s power grid. First, as President Trump has already ordered, federal regulators overseeing interstate electrical networks and nuclear power should expedite permit approvals for new transmission and generation projects to help increase the speed at which grid upgrades happen and decrease the costs that consumers ultimately pay.

Second, state public utility regulators can actively encourage utilities to propose new investments in transmission and generation. Utilities who are adding grid capacity can, in turn, work to attract new large-load customers like data centers to their service territories, since those customers pay the incremental construction and operating costs incurred to serve them power.

Data centers can be built anywhere in the country and still serve users everywhere, so they will naturally go to communities that have the electricity and welcome the new investment, jobs and tax revenue. It’s up to local governments and planning commissions to evaluate the benefits of attracting large data centers who spend billions in construction, employ hundreds of high school grads in six-figure operations jobs and pay millions in new property taxes. Where local officials find those upsides persuasive, they need to explain the benefits to citizens, parents and homeowners to counter the NIMBY protesters doing their best to prevent America from building the power and data infrastructure we require to drive our economy and compete in the modern era.

While America’s tech industry makes an easy target for radical environmentalists and NIMBYs to flip the script on America’s Golden Age, the Berkeley Labs study clearly shows that upgrading our outdated power infrastructure is a challenge America must urgently address. Data centers are helping absorb the bulk of new fixed costs, putting downward pressure on electric bills for ratepayers in the areas they serve. Now, policymakers and regulators must roll back onerous regulations so utilities can make the necessary, forward-thinking investments to increase energy grid capacity and reliability and stabilize costs for Americans.",https://netchoice.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/nasa-1lfI7wkGWZ4-unsplash-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-28 13:10:20.937889

That’s the question Ford aims to answer with its Home Power Management program, the next step in the automaker’s quest to sweeten EV ownership for its customers.

Ford said Tuesday that owners of the electric F-150 Lightning who buy the Ford Charging Station Pro and Home Integration System will be able to charge their truck with lower-cost electricity “in select markets where electricity rates change throughout the day.” Typically that’s overnight, when there’s less demand for electricity. Those users would then be able to use the energy stored in their truck’s battery to power their home when rates are higher.

The automaker is launching a pilot program with DTE Energy, a Detroit-based energy company, to test vehicle-to-home managed charging, starting with 15 Ford employees. DTE will compensate participants for sharing some of their vehicle’s battery capacity.

DTE’s grid will send notifications to ChargeScape, a vehicle-to-grid integration platform backed by Ford and other automakers, which will then communicate with the EV and manage its battery.

“We’re starting to move beyond the obvious perks of EV ownership—like instant torque and ditching gas stations—to potentially unlock new value: turning your F-150 Lightning vehicle into a smart personal power plant that can help you save money on your monthly electricity bills, and earn financial incentives from your participating electricity company,” Bill Crider, Ford’s head of global charging and energy services, wrote in a blog post.

How it works: Ryan O’Gorman, senior manager of Ford’s energy services business strategy and delivery, demonstrated how the technology works from the driveway of his suburban Detroit home, where he has an F-150 Lightning, a home charger, and Ford’s Home Integration System.

O’Gorman typically has his truck’s battery powering his home from 11am to 7pm. When there’s a power outage, the EV would disconnect from the grid, he explained, and the system would then kick in to power his house. He’s used it to power his home for days.

“Most people have some anxiety about how much range they’re going to lose, but I don’t think they have a comprehension of how big the battery is and how much your house uses,” he said.

“It’s about six miles per hour that you’re powering your house. So if you think about that, in a typical peak period that you might run is four or five hours, you’re talking maybe 20, 30 miles that you’re going to tick away off your truck. And when you have a 300-mile range truck…it’s not impactful.”

Ford estimates the average customer could save about $42 per month on their electricity bills.

The system, which users can control via the Ford Energy app, adjusts in real time to factors like battery health and electricity prices, and learns customer preferences like their typical daily departure time, according to Ford.

“Your car doesn’t do anything most of its life; 90% of its life, it’s just sitting. Now it’s working for you,” O’Gorman said. “It’s a unique utilization of the vehicle that you can’t do with other types of vehicles.”

Scaling up: Ford rolled out managed charging programs, later added backup power capability, and now is expanding the Home Power Management system. In the future, the automaker aims to scale up V2G tech that allows EV batteries to discharge energy back to the grid. Ford is running a V2G pilot using Home Power Management with a small group of Baltimore Gas & Electric customers.

V2G technology is still nascent and will require buy-in from utilities, but there’s lots of optimism about its potential to convert EVs into major grid assets.

“EVs have always been this villain,” O’Gorman said. “They’re not the problem. They’re actually going to solve the problem.”","https://cdn.sanity.io/images/bl383u0v/production/09a20c125a3765de63fad6cbcb3c81724f86449b-8551x4810.jpg?rect=0,160,8551,4489&w=1200&h=630&q=70&fit=crop&auto=format",N,,2025-10-28 13:11:31.764878

LANSING, Michigan – Lieutenant Governor Garlin Gilchrist II today joined a celebration of community-led climate and environmental justice action 12 months in the making: the successful close of the first year of Michigan's Justice40 Accelerator and the announcement that participants will continue for a second year with a new name.

The newly named MI Healthy Climate Community Accelerator (Community Accelerator) will further center community-led climate action on the goals in the state’s Michigan Healthy Climate Plan (MHCP). The MHCP commits the state to becoming carbon neutral by 2050 in a just and equitable manner. This includes ensuring that Michigan’s historically disadvantaged communities benefit from at least 40% of state funding for climate and water infrastructure – the meaning of the term Justice40.

“Governor Whitmer and I are committed to building a healthier Michigan where everyone can succeed,” Gilchrist said. “Thanks to our work on clean energy, we’re creating good-paying jobs and protecting our environment. The MI Healthy Climate Community Accelerator will help us build on that progress and continue supporting community-based organizations who are working on the frontlines of the future to grow our economy, achieve our climate goals, and invest in our cities and towns. Let’s keep Standing Tall so every Michigander can thrive.”

The accelerator program launched in October 2024 to support 25 community-based organizations selected from frontline communities across Michigan in building capacity for enduring and equitable climate action. Frontline communities experience the impacts of climate change “first and worst” and are often historically disadvantaged.

In its first year, the program provided participation funding, one-on-one technical assistance, training, and partnership-building opportunities to participating organizations.

The members of the accelerator cohort (listed below) were chosen based in part on project ideas for equitably addressing climate change in their communities. Projects included electric vehicle ride share infrastructure, energy efficient home development, and youth engagement and training programs.

Members of the cohort submitted more than 35 public funding applications and built their organizational capacity through resource and technical assistance support. Eligible to apply were Michigan-based nonprofits, cooperatives, fiscally sponsored projects, and tribal-serving organizations with 501(c)(3) status operating in or serving qualifying communities.

The Office of Climate and Energy (OCE) and the Office of the Environmental Justice Public Advocate (OEJPA) in the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy (EGLE) launched the 12-month accelerator in partnership with equitable clean energy nonprofit Elevate and the Michigan Environmental Justice Coalition (MEJC). Elevate operates the program with MEJC subcontracted for support and community engagement.

Gearing up for 2026

In the year ahead, EGLE will continue supporting cohort members with ongoing climate and environmental justice goals in alignment with the MHCP. The program is being reimagined using feedback from cohort members and in consideration of the changing landscape in policy and funding for climate and environmental justice work.

Through the Community Accelerator, participants will set goals to advance climate-related missions or projects, connect to available resources, and build stronger partnerships across Michigan communities and sectors.

The continuing cohort is expected to launch programming in February and continue through Dec. 31, 2026.

“This proven program will continue to empower communities with the greatest needs to acquire the resources for local action to protect our air, land, and water and improve public health and quality of life,” said EGLE Director Phil Roos. “EGLE remains committed to a more sustainable future for all Michiganders and for generations to come.”

“Partnering with EGLE for another year of the MI Healthy Climate Community Accelerator underscores our commitment to advancing equitable climate solutions,” said Elevate CEO Dr. Anne Evens. “Together, we’re helping communities build resilience, develop creative approaches to extreme weather, and ensure families across Michigan can thrive.”

“The Michigan Environmental Justice Coalition is excited to work together again with our partners at EGLE and Elevate on a second year of MI Healthy Climate Community Accelerator,” said MEJC Program Manager Latia Leonard. “I’m excited for the opportunity to continue our momentum of relationship building, engagement, and learning as a community from year one. Year two of the Community Accelerator will be set on a strong foundation.”

The company, which has its U.S. headquarters in Glendale, Wis., has a contract with an unnamed North American automaker to deliver upward of 800,000 supercapacitors annually for a 2028 model year vehicle.

Already the world’s largest manufacturer of 12-volt passenger car batteries, it is evaluating a number of plants, including the Meadowbrook lithium ion battery facility in Holland.

Meadowbrook is also near one of the company’s research and development centers and prototype manufacturing labs.

At CES in Las Vegas in January, Clarios detailed plans to buy supercapacitors from a supplier and assemble them in a package with a standard 12-volt battery and a battery management system that would be delivered to an automaker as a plug-and-play power pack.

Federico Morales-Zimmerman, Clarios’ vice president in charge of technology and customers, told Automotive News that the company aims to buy or partner with an established supercapacitor manufacturer and to select the plant location.

A Michigan supercapacitor plant would put production close to the customer and possibly reduce supply chain complexity. Clarios officials would not comment on the criteria they are using to select the plant. There is pressure to move quickly, however.

Whatever plant is chosen, it would have to be outfitted with supercapacitor production machinery and testing equipment. Clarios also would need a workforce trained to produce the small cylindrical device.

Clarios was previously owned by Johnson Controls Inc., which sold off the company in 2019 for more than $13.2 billion to Toronto-based private equity firm Brookfield Business Partners LP. Clarios operates the Meadowbrook plant, where JCI had previously leveraged funding during the Obama administration to launch lithium-ion battery manufacturing.

The supercapacitor’s role

Supercapacitors help manage a vehicle’s electric loads. They provide a short, quick and intense burst of electricity required by some vehicle components. Unlike a battery, supercapacitors are not energy dense, meaning that they don’t have the ability to deliver power for a long period of time. Instead, they release all the stored power at once.

A fully charged supercapacitor drains in about 30 seconds. That would be enough to start a diesel-powered pickup in zero-degree weather.

Supercapacitors might also have a role to play in vehicle safety, Clarios officials said. They could be used for brake- and steer-by-wire systems. Supercapacitors can be made from recyclable materials and are not dependent on the rare earth materials caught up in trade tensions between the U.S. and China.

First use in a mainstream passenger vehicle

Clarios would not name its customer but did reveal that each power pack would have four supercapacitors.

There are only a handful of vehicle programs that would create such a large demand for the component, primarily domestic manufacturers of pickups. Ford made more than 750,000 F-Series pickups in 2024, while General Motors produced more than 880,000 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickups. Stellantis built nearly 375,000 Ram trucks last year.

Clarios provided a tour of its research and prototype build lab here, showing how it can package the supercapacitors in a weathertight plastic box. The version of the supercapacitor destined for high-volume production looks a bit like a standard D size flashlight battery. It’s about half as tall and would be wired in series to be used with 12- and 48-volt components in the 2028 vehicle.

“We will do the full systems integration,” said Eric Michielutti, Clarios’ director of lithium ion product and technology.

The company will house the components in a black box with other electronics and “componentry that will communicate to the vehicle the status of the energy storage device,” he said.

Supercapacitors have been used in a few niche applications in low-production passenger vehicles. And they are used on some open-wheel race cars as a sort of electric supercharger. Eaton has produced supercapacitors for industrial equipment for years, but no high-volume mainstream vehicles have been equipped with the energy storage devices.

Although battery technology has existed for decades, to date most of it has been produced outside of the United States. Now as the market grows, the American battery industry is racing to catch up, with new innovations and domestic facilities spanning raw material resources to final battery production. And across the emerging “Battery Belt,” there is an opportunity for every state to play a major role – particularly North Carolina.

North Carolina boasts several qualities to launch new innovative industries, including cutting-edge research centers and a powerful manufacturing base. These nationally-leading characteristics set the stage for North Carolinians to play a leading role in the development of a secure, resilient, and homegrown battery supply chain. In October, the C2ES Regional Clean Economies Initiative partnered with the North Carolina Battery Industry Partnership to bring together over forty representatives of business, government, and communities for a workshop in Charlotte, North Carolina focused on solutions to support the battery supply chain in the state.

In the battery supply chain, North Carolina can have it all: The state has forthcoming and operational facilities that span the full value chain, from critical minerals extraction and processing to the final assembly of batteries. The state university and technical college system provides a robust talent pipeline that can provide the workforce of the future while supporting a research ecosystem for new battery materials and production technologies. Our roundtable participants celebrated the state’s achievements to date in attracting Toyota’s major battery assembly facility in Liberty, NC, supporting development of its lithium resources by Elevra and Albemarle, and working hand in hand with incoming companies to develop supporting infrastructure.

However, the battery industry’s future isn’t yet fully-charged , with recent changes to federal tax credits and the loss of some direct funding for battery projects across the United States, the rapidly shifting policy environment is injecting significant uncertainty into an industry that was just starting to spark. These sentiments echo what we’ve heard in other battery supply chain events across the Southeast. States and communities are worried that the current uncertainty will prevent them from seeing the job growth and tax revenue the industry was poised to bring before this seismic policy shift. Yet in the face of this uncertainty, demand for these products continues to rise alongside our power demand, and investing in the domestic supply chain will be crucial to ensuring American communities can capture the economic opportunity this market has to offer.

To support the battery industry in North Carolina, roundtable participants developed several actionable recommendations that can support the private sector, developing infrastructure, attracting capital, enhancing safety, and building out the supply chain. These included recommendations for:

a “smart onshoring” policy framework to bring companies in the battery industry to the state

a convening to bring together investors and new battery technology developers/startups

a national framework for safety to support communities and technology developers

Just a week after the company’s Chief Designer Franz von Holzhausen reaffirmed that the unveil event is still on track to take place this year, a new job listing confirmed that preparations are underway.

According to its website, and as first noticed by Tesla shareholder and X user Sawyer Merritt, the company is hiring a Manufacturing Engineer for concept development and battery manufacturing.

“In this role you will take large scale manufacturing systems for new battery products and architectures from the early concept development stage through equipment launch, optimization and handover to local operations teams,” the job description says.

Tesla noted that “this is an exciting opportunity to work directly on the central challenges for the all-new Roadster product architecture while still in its early development stages.”

The full-time position is based at Tesla‘s Fremont factory in California.

This Tuesday, the company posted on X that the Fremont facility — opened exactly 15 years ago — has produced 3.6 million vehicles to date and created more than 20,000 jobs in the state.

In last week’s episode of the Ride the Lightning podcast, von Holzhausen revealed that Tesla is “planning on this year” for the unveiling of the model.

According to von Holzhausen, the model will be available “within two years” from now.

The confirmation came a few months after Tesla‘s VP of Vehicle Engineering Lars Moravy teased that the Roadster model was under development.

The first generation of the Roaster, Tesla‘s first production vehicle, was launched in 2008 and sold until 2012.

Five years later, as the Roadster neared its ten-year anniversary, Tesla announced plans for a second-generation model.

However, eight years have passed since that announcement, and the vehicle has still not been unveiled.

“I think it comes to those who wait,” the Chief Designer noted, as the company nears the twenty-year mark of the sports car.

In February 2024, Musk had written on X that the company had “radically increased the design goals for the new Tesla Roadster. There will never be another car like this, if you could even call it a car,” he wrote.

The findings quantify for the first time how the political actions of the world’s wealthiest person — including his role in U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration — may have cost Tesla billions in lost vehicle sales while benefiting rival electric carmakers.

Tesla’s U.S. sales would have been between 67% and 83% higher, or about 1 million to 1.26 million additional vehicles, from October 2022 to April 2025, had it not been for what researchers call the “Musk partisan effect”, according to a working paper from the National Bureau of Economic Research by Yale University economists.

Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the report.

As Democratic-leaning buyers shifted away from Tesla, that effect also boosted the sales of competitors’ electric and hybrid vehicles by roughly 17% to 22%, the study found.

The Yale University researchers linked the drop to Musk’s increasingly partisan behavior, including his roughly $300 million in donations to Republican candidates as well as leadership of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) under Trump.

Musk’s political stance has alienated environmentally minded Democratic buyers — historically Tesla’s strongest base — according to surveys cited in the report.

Sentiment toward Tesla improved somewhat as Musk pivoted the company towards robotaxis, self-driving technology and robots in human form.

Tesla board Chair Robyn Denholm said in an interview with CNBC on Monday that the outside perception of Musk spending time in the U.S. government had diminished.

The NBER paper said Musk’s actions also hampered California’s progress toward its zero-emissions vehicle goals, concluding that the state would likely have met its 2026 targets “had it not been for the Musk partisan effect”.

Registrations of Tesla cars in the state fell 9.4% in the third quarter, with its market share falling to 46.2% in the three-month period.

Governor Stitt has long been a champion for Oklahoma’s energy industry with a free-market based approach that opens the door for more electricity generation.
This year, he spearheaded legislation to allow companies to build their own power generation for large projects.
“Oklahoma leads the nation for power generation because of our energy abundance agenda,” said Governor Stitt.","HARRISBURG- On Tuesday, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro and Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt led a bipartisan, multi-state response to the nation’s energy crisis by sending a series of recommendations for federal permitting reforms to committee chairmen and ranking members in the U.S. Senate and House to help speed the delivery of critical energy infrastructure projects without compromising environmental protections.

The letter was developed by the National Governor Association’s Permitting Working Group that was announced in February and is co-led by Governor Shapiro and Governor Stitt. The letter was co-signed by Colorado Governor Jared Polis, Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont, Indiana Governor Mike Braun, Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry, Maryland Governor Wes Moore, Massachusetts Governor Maura Healey, North Dakota Governor Kelly Armstrong, Rhode Island Governor Daniel McKee, Tennessee Governor Bill Lee, Utah Governor Spencer Cox, and Wyoming Governor Mark Golden.

In the letter, the coalition says that, “In 2023, a bipartisan group of Governors released a vision for federal permitting reform that was ultimately incorporated into the Fiscal Responsibility Act—a key step forward. We now write again with greater urgency, in the context of rising demand for electricity to serve computing, industrial, manufacturing, building, and transportation needs, to provide a set of commonsense compromises that we believe can meet the moment.”

The Coalition continues, saying, “that effective implementation of these compromises depends on federal agencies that have adequate staff and resources to speed up permitting processes as well as processes and final decisions that are technology-neutral, apolitical, and which can be relied upon with certainty by investors and developers. While members of the working group are pursuing various types of energy projects based on the resource mixes and priorities of each of our states, as a group we believe it is critical that federal permitting be administered in a technology-neutral and apolitical manner that allows energy projects of all types to move forward. Given the current demands on the grid, ensuring reliability and keeping costs low for consumers requires that a diverse mix of energy types be permitted and brought online to help meet our resource needs.”

“In Pennsylvania, we’re doubling down on our energy legacy by taking big, decisive steps to build new sources of power,” said Governor Shapiro. “My Administration has prioritized streamlining government to work for the people it serves and has responsibly sped up permitting to get new energy projects online and grow Pennsylvania’s economy. It’s far past time that we position the United States to do the same in order to win the energy and AI race, and lower energy costs for all Americans.”

At a moment when power needs are at an all-time high and the rapid development of technology and AI is putting new demands on our grid, it’s more important than ever that we take our foot off the brake and ensure our energy industry can quickly innovate, build, and deliver power to Americans and our allies.”",https://tristatealert.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/oil-rig-energy-2022-04-09-07-32-55-utc-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-28 13:12:30.780561

Specifically, the agency is developing a proposed rule that would add discarded solar panels to the federal universal-waste program (40 CFR Part 273) and, in the case of lithium batteries, establish a distinct universal-waste category tailored to address their unique risks. US EPA’s stated goal, detailed on its website (EPA – Improving Recycling and Management of Renewable Energy Wastes), is to make the management of these materials safer and more efficient while encouraging recycling and recovery of critical minerals essential to renewable technologies.

What the Rule Would Do

Under the proposed rulemaking:

Discarded solar panels that qualify as hazardous waste could be managed under universal-waste standards, simplifying the regulatory requirements for their end-of-life management.

For lithium batteries, EPA intends to create a specialized universal-waste category separate from the existing “universal-waste battery” regulations, with additional safety standards to address fire hazard, while still promoting recycling.

Timing and Scope

According to EPA, they expect to issue a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking around February 2026 with a projected Final Rule around August 2027.

Potential Implications for Industry

If your company is involved in generating, managing, transporting or recycling end-of-life solar panels or lithium-battery wastes, this rulemaking will likely impact future operations. For solar-panel waste handlers, the shift toward universal-waste status will reduce certain compliance burdens and uncertainty (such as manifesting, transporter requirements or generator status counts) and facilitate easier recycling. Since lithium batteries previously qualified as universal waste under the general battery category, this revision may actually increase the burden on many lithium battery waste operators. Companies should anticipate enhanced safety measures tailored to lithium battery chemistries, potentially including new labeling, handling, storage, transportation or recycler requirements.

Vorys will continue to track this rulemaking. We recommend companies do the same and consider participation in the rulemaking, such as submitting public comments. When the proposal is released, companies should immediately evaluate its effects and prepare for necessary operational adjustments.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.16345_5041.jpg,N,,2025-10-28 12:06:03.282699

PURPOSE: To analyze all aspects of the property/casualty and liability insurance markets for residential properties in New York and to consider legislative and policy changes to promote access and affordability for all property owners and the long-term stability of insurance markets

Date: November 18, 2025

Time: 10:00 AM

Location: 250 Broadway, New York, NY 10007 – 19th Floor Senate Hearing Room

ORAL TESTIMONY BY INVITATION ONLY

Both homeowners and multifamily property operators have reported substantial increases in the cost of insuring their property and, in some cases, have had difficulty obtaining and maintaining insurance coverage. Insurance markets in New York are regulated by the Department of Financial Services (DFS) pursuant to statute, and are intended to provide stable, affordable coverage through diversified risk pools and predictable pricing models, while supporting the state’s housing stock through accessible insurance products that enable property ownership and maintenance. Yet the delivery of affordable residential insurance coverage in New York has become, for many property owners, a source of financial strain and uncertainty. Markets designed to protect property owners from routine risks as well as catastrophic losses have become increasingly difficult to navigate.

In many parts of the United States, residential property/casualty insurance markets have undergone dramatic transformation over the past decade, with carriers confronting unprecedented challenges from climate-related disasters, escalating reinsurance costs, and inflationary pressures that have fundamentally altered the risk landscape for both single-family homeowners and multifamily property operators. Since 2010, there has been an increased frequency and severity of weather events, supply chain interruptions affecting the costs of construction and repair, and significant changes in carrier behavior nationally, including market withdrawals and coverage restrictions in some states. Increasingly frequent and severe storms, the recent catastrophic wildfires that devastated Southern California and Hawaii, and the severe flooding that impacted Texas and North Carolina have elevated national attention on property insurance market dynamics, with observers increasingly describing the current environment as presenting fundamental challenges to the industry's long-term viability.

Of course, New York has not been immune from extreme weather events and other climate-driven dangers, which may already be contributing to increasing costs of property/casualty insurance here and are projected to become more frequent and severe. As of 2023, there were more than 1,150 property and casualty insurance companies doing business in New York with total assets of approximately $2.6 trillion and net premiums of more than $723 billion. While this market has not yet experienced the levels of distress that have been seen in some other states, it is essential for New York to ensure that property/casualty insurance markets are affordable, accessible, and stable in the years to come.

As with property/casualty insurance, liability coverage plays an important role in protecting and maintaining housing of all types throughout the state, yet many property owners have seen drastic increases in the cost of liability insurance policies in recent years. Lenders generally require property owners to carry these policies, but according to the New York Housing Conference’s March 2024 policy brief, multifamily property owners must contend with rising costs for their liability policy premiums even as those more expensive policies now offer decreased coverage, increased deductible thresholds, and more exclusions. Uncontrolled increases in costs, and reduction or elimination of coverage, pose a major threat to the stability of individual properties and to the state’s broad efforts to provide safe, accessible, affordable housing for all New Yorkers.

In November 2022, DFS and New York Homes Community Renewal (HCR) conducted a study to examine the increasing costs of insurance premiums and decreasing availability of insurance coverage for multifamily affordable housing, pursuant to Chapter 790, S5231/A5574 (Kavanagh/Cymbrowitz). The report collected stakeholder feedback from affordable housing developers; analyzed the insurance costs and coverage of affordable housing projects within HCR's portfolio; and examined factors that may contribute to the underwriting, rating, and price-setting of premiums of fire and casualty insurance plans. The report found that “insurer inquiries about affordable housing raise legitimate concerns from stakeholders about the potential for unfairly discriminatory results” and the state enacted new laws banning discrimination against affordable housing in insurance premiums and coverage decisions. The larger issues of rising insurance costs remain unresolved and a key burden for affordable as well as market-rate multifamily affordable housing operators and individual homeowners.

Uncovering the Key Cost Drivers of Residential Insurance Policies

The Senate Committees on Investigations and Government Operations; Insurance; and Housing, Construction, and Community Development are working jointly to examine the factors contributing to costs and availability of insurance for residential properties in New York. In August 2025, the Committees launched a formal investigation to request documents and information from DFS, insurance associations, and carriers with targeted questions examining market-related factors behind the reported rise of insurance premium costs. Responses are expected to inform the Committees on the potential link between larger, market- and/or actuarial-based considerations in insurance underwriting and how they may have impacted the pricing of coverage offered for New York property owners and individual homeowners.

Potential Legislative Actions

This hearing will continue the Committees’ efforts to examine the causes of rising insurance costs and market behavior of carriers, profitability and general financial solvency, special challenges facing multifamily coverage, regulatory oversight, the market’s reaction to climate change, and the interplay between New York’s insurance market and national casualty insurance business models. The Committees seek testimony from insurers and insurance regulators, homeowners and multifamily property operators, experts on the risks of climate change and extreme weather, and other relevant experts and stakeholders, with the goal of shedding light on the challenges identified above and identifying any appropriate legislative and policy changes that the state should consider.

Persons wishing to present pertinent testimony to the Committees at the above hearing should complete and return the enclosed reply form as soon as possible. It is important that the reply form be fully completed and returned so that persons may be notified in the event of emergency postponement or cancellation.

Oral testimony will be limited to five minutes duration. Ten copies of any prepared testimony should be submitted at the hearing registration desk. The Committees would appreciate advance receipt of prepared statements.

Last week, a judge from Louisiana’s 38th Judicial District Court effectively halted construction of Commonwealth LNG by ordering state regulators to analyze the facility’s climate change and environmental justice-related impacts, in conjunction with the broader LNG buildout in southwest Louisiana’s Cameron Parish.

Three of the nation’s eight existing LNG export terminals are located in Cameron Parish, and several more are proposed or under construction there.

Louisiana’s attorney general vowed to appeal the ruling, which vacated the Louisiana Department of Conservation and Energy’s coastal use permit for the facility.

“This is the first time any court has vacated a permit for an LNG facility based on the government’s refusal to consider climate change impacts,” said Clay Garside, an attorney representing the Sierra Club and other environmental groups.

Earlier this year, Trump reversed a Biden-era pause on exports of liquefied natural gas, or LNG, as part of his goal to boost natural gas exports and promote “energy dominance.”

Last year, the Biden administration’s Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm’s had warned that “unfettered exports” of liquefied natural gas would increase planet- warming greenhouse gas emissions — a statement reflecting the findings of a Department of Energy report released in December.

Trump-appointed Energy Secretary Chris Wright, a fossil fuel executive, has moved to fast-track the buildout of LNG facilities, including Commonwealth LNG, which received an export authorization within weeks of Trump’s inauguration.

“Cameron Parish is ground zero for the relentless expansion of the gas export industry,” said Anne Rolfes, founder of the Louisiana Bucket Brigade, an environmental group involved in the litigation. “We’re going to stop it and this is an important step in that process.”

Lyle Hanna, a Commonwealth LNG spokesperson, said that “we are disappointed with the District Court’s decision, and we are exploring all available legal options.”

A spokesperson for the Louisiana Department of Conservation and Energy declined to comment, citing the potential of pending litigation. Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill said that the state planned to appeal.

“Sadly even state court judges are not immune from climate activism,” Murrill said.

Last year, a federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., had ordered the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to reassess Commonwealth LNG’s air pollution, including its greenhouse gas emissions. In June, the commission gave the project a greenlight on the grounds that its construction was in the public interest.

In regulatory filings, the Louisiana Department of Conservation and Energy said that “climate change is currently beyond the scope” of the state’s regulatory review.

But District Judge Penelope Richard rejected this position, saying state environmental regulators have a duty to consider how the LNG facility, along with others clustered nearby, would impact extreme weather events, storm severity and sea-level rise in a state where a football field-worth of land disappears every 100 minutes.

Richard also ordered state regulators to analyze the facility’s impacts on local communities, especially those living in poverty or relying on fishing for their livelihoods — which she noted was the “defining characteristic” of the parish. While the facility could destroy marshes, harm water quality and displace residents, the judge wrote, “none of it was considered in terms of impacts on environmental justice communities.”

Commercial fisherman Eddie LeJuine, a lifelong Cameron Parish resident, applauded the ruling. He said the buildout of LNG infrastructure, including dredging for shipping channels, has significantly harmed the fishing industry.

“The fishermen are barely hanging on with a thread,” LeJuine said. “These plants are killing the estuary and killing our livelihoods. We’re getting extinct.”

In August, a dredging channel being developed by LNG firm Venture Global leaked into a nearby estuary. Local fishermen like LeJuine say the onslaught of saltwater and sediment will kill off large amounts of oyster, crab and fish.

Venture Global, which is in the process of constructing a second LNG export terminal in the parish, said it is “committed to conservation” and is working with state regulators and the community to respond to the incident.",https://americanpress.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/65/2022/03/Commonwealth-LNG.jpg,N,,2025-10-28 13:12:48.554299

Now, the nation has unveiled its plans to enter the European wind sector and has announced a 24.5 MW floating turbine that some have stated is the largest of its kind in the world. China is universally renowned for its astonishing engineering excellence, and the nation boasts the ability to reshape the energy sector through several projects that realign the future of the energy market.

China has become a global leader in the adoption and implementation of the renewable energy sector

The world has become acutely aware of the need to diversify the energy sector through the adoption and implementation of the renewable energy sector. For far too long, the fossil fuel sector has dominated the market, and while the progress made in modernizing the conventional energy sector is commendable, the future of powering the world has turned to the untapped potential of the renewable sector.

As the renewable energy sector gains momentum in the race to power the world, China has emerged as a global leader in the sector. China produces the vast majority of the world’s solar panels, and recently announced its plans to build a huge factory in Scotland to serve fixed-bottom and floating offshore wind farm projects in the UK and Europe.

“The use of solar energy offers huge potential for natural resource and climate protection, and for the expansion of renewable energies on the road to a future-oriented energy supply.” – Margareta Wolf

China’s Mingyang Smart Energy has unveiled plans to develop a massive 50 MW floating offshore wind turbine

Building on the strength that the nation has displayed in the solar sector, China’s Mingyang Smart Energy company has unveiled its plans to build a huge floating offshore wind turbine, similar to the company’s Ocean-X platform, a 16.6 MW floating unit launched last year.

Mingyang’s turbine will feature twin 290-meter rotors, and the company has stated that the plan is to install the turbine in deep waters. Additionally, Mingyang has noted that it plans to invest up to $1.9 billion to build a manufacturing facility in Scotland that would serve the deployment of floating technology at scale in the UK.

Mingyang said that several sites in Scotland have been shortlisted, with Ardersier Port near Inverness being the first choice, although a final decision has not been made. The project would enable the redeployment of workers previously employed in the oil and gas sector. As several European nations have noted the successful development of locally produced wind turbine components, China is still the leading nation in the global energy sector transition.

Former Presidents and political leaders have pointed to the end of the coal and gas sector as accelerating the need to diversify the global market.

““Because we are now running out of gas and oil, we must prepare quickly for a third change, to strict conservation and to the use of coal and permanent renewable energy sources, like solar power.” – Former United States President Jimmy Carter

Attachment Volvo Trucks Certified EV Dealer Map Lawren Markle TRC, for Volvo Trucks North America 424-224-5364 lmarkle@trccompanies.com","Greensboro, N.C., Oct. 28, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Volvo Trucks North America continues to lead the transition to electromobility, with more than 700 Volvo VNR Electric trucks now operating across the United States and Canada. Together, these vehicles have logged more than 20 million zero-tailpipe-emission miles, eliminating an estimated 34,000 metric tons of CO₂—the equivalent of taking more than 7,000 passenger cars off the road for a full year1.

These North American results contribute to Volvo Trucks’ global momentum in heavy-duty electrification. Since launching its first electric trucks in 2019, Volvo has delivered more than 5,700 electric vehicles across 50 countries, which have collectively driven 250 million kilometers (155 million miles). Volvo Trucks continues to hold a leading position globally and has maintained an average of over 30% market share in the North American electric truck segment over the past five years.

“Reaching this milestone is a testament to our customers’ commitment to sustainable transportation and our dealer network’s dedication to supporting them every step of the way,” said Peter Voorhoeve, president, Volvo Trucks North America. “The path to zero emissions is shaped by market conditions, which are moving slowly. We remain committed to our vision to create a world we want to live in by using zero emissions solutions in combination with fuel efficient combustion engines with reduced climate impact. Solutions that will work for our clients where sustainability meets affordability.”

83 Certified EV dealerships across North America

Since TEC Equipment – Fontana became the first Volvo Trucks Certified EV Dealer in July 2021, the network has expanded rapidly to 83 certified locations across 33 U.S. states and four Canadian provinces. The latest additions bring four new states—Colorado, Louisiana, Maryland, and Nevada—and four new dealer groups into the program. Another 13 locations are currently in the certification pipeline.

Certified dealers complete extensive EV training and invest in facility upgrades to deliver full sales and service support for battery-electric trucks.

Cutting CO₂ Across All Drivelines

Volvo Trucks is advancing cleaner and more efficient solutions across its entire product range. In North America, the all-new Volvo VNL delivers up to 10% better fuel efficiency than its predecessor. For a truck running 120,000 miles per year, that translates to about 1,300 fewer gallons of fuel and a reduction of roughly 30,000 pounds of CO₂.

Fuel-efficient combustion engines that can also run on renewable fuels are one part of Volvo Trucks’ three-path approach to decarbonization—together with battery-electric and fuel-cell electric trucks.

These models include the Volvo FL Electric, FE Electric, FM Electric, FM Low Entry, FMX Electric, FH Electric, FH Aero Electric, and the VNR Electric.

How it all started…

Volvo Trucks’ leadership in zero-tailpipe emission transportation began with the launch of the Volvo VNR Electric as part of the pioneering Volvo LIGHTS Project. The $90 million public-private partnership laid the foundation for the widespread adoption of heavy-duty battery-electric trucks by exploring the infrastructure and operational adaptations required to support electromobility. Volvo Trucks is also a key partner in California’s Joint Electric Truck Scaling Initiative (JETSI), which deployed Class 8 battery-electric trucks across Southern California to demonstrate strategies to successfully scale market penetration of zero emission technologies.

ENGIE North America, the North American subsidiary of French energy group Engie SA, has entered into new power purchase agreements (PPAs) with Meta Platforms, Inc., expanding their collaboration to over 1.3 gigawatts (GW) of renewable energy projects in the United States. This announcement marks a new milestone in the commercial relationship between the two entities, with a particular focus on the state of Texas.

The main project of this extension is Swenson Ranch Solar, a 600 megawatt (MW) solar power plant located in Stonewall County, southeast of Lubbock. Once completed, this project will become the largest solar asset in ENGIE North America’s portfolio. The entire site will be dedicated to supplying electricity to Meta’s data centre operations in the United States.

A strategic asset in ENGIE’s US portfolio

Swenson Ranch Solar is part of a broader portfolio of more than 11 GW of solar, wind and battery storage projects that ENGIE North America currently operates or is constructing. The Texas facility represents a significant share of that capacity, reinforcing ENGIE’s footprint in the US renewable energy market.

Total investment for the construction of Swenson is estimated at $900mn, with commissioning planned for 2027. The project is expected to create over 350 skilled jobs during the construction phase, according to the company’s estimates. No additional details were disclosed regarding subcontractors or the exact construction schedule.

Meta aims for full electricity coverage

As part of this agreement, Meta has committed to purchasing 100% of the electricity generated by Swenson Ranch Solar, strengthening its energy supply strategy for its digital infrastructure. This acquisition complements Meta’s previous commitments to power its US data centres entirely with renewable energy.

Under a 25-year agreement announced Monday afternoon, the tech giant will buy power from the Duane Arnold plant, which closed for decommissioning in 2020, once the 615-megawatt station returns to service in 2029.

“This partnership serves as a model for the investments needed across the country to build energy capacity and deliver reliable, clean power, while protecting affordability and creating jobs that will drive the AI-driven economy.” Ruth Porat, president and chief investment officer of Google and its parent company Alphabet, said in a statement.

But the number of still-salvageable nuclear plants sitting idle across the country is limited.

Some operating plants could still be uprated to crank out more electrons, but there aren’t many other plants on which tech behemoths with big electricity needs can bet. So the industry is getting creative; the Google deal is just one of a flurry of recent deals to get more nuclear power onto the grid, pushed by both the government and the private sector.

The agreement comes a week after South Carolina’s largest utility, Santee Cooper, announced plans to revive its infamously failed project to build the state’s first pair of AP1000s. The so-called VC Summer plant collapsed under surging costs in 2017 and led to two utility executives going to prison for lying about the project’s viability. But Santee Cooper is now in advanced talks with Brookfield about restarting the construction, The Wall Street Journal reported last week.

Meanwhile, nuclear giant Westinghouse Electric Company announced a “strategic partnership” with the U.S. government on Tuesday morning to build a series of new reactors with “at least” $80 billion in funding from federal coffers.

The Trump administration sees the partnership with Westinghouse as part of President Donald Trump’s “grand vision to fully energize America and win the global AI race,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a press release Tuesday morning. And in his own statement, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said the partnership “supports our national security objectives and enhances our critical infrastructure.”

“Together with Westinghouse we will unleash American energy,” he said.

Westinghouse’s two co-owners, investment giant Brookfield Asset Management and uranium producer Cameco, each said the deal would accelerate growth at both the national and international levels.

The move comes in response to one of Trump’s four executive orders from May designed to boost nuclear development. The order in question directed the Department of Energy to facilitate the swift permitting and construction of at least 10 new large-scale reactors in the country.

Given that the only new reactors built from the ground-up since the 1990s were a pair of AP1000s at Southern Company’s Plant Vogtle in Georgia, the order was widely interpreted as a red carpet for Westinghouse, though some other companies expressed interest in bidding into the U.S. market, including Canadian rival Atkinsrealis.

It’s not clear if the Santee Cooper VC Summer project would count among those funded by the federal partnership.

Momentum for SMRs

There has also been recent movement for smaller-scale nuclear.

Separate from the company’s NextEra deal, Google is betting on next-generation small modular reactors to deliver new atomic electrons to the grid. In August, the Tennessee Valley Authority inked the nation’s first power purchase agreement between a utility and fourth-generation nuclear development to support construction of Google-backed Kairos Power’s first plant in the Oak Ridge area.

While the technology for fourth-generation reactors, which use coolants other than water, has been around for decades, the entire U.S. commercial fleet relies on light water reactor designs. A series of startups, including Bill Gates’ TerraPower, Amazon-backed X-energy, and Kairos are competing to build the country’s first commercial plants using small modular reactors that depend on high temperature gas, molten salt, or other coolants and therefore reach higher temperatures that may expand the applications nuclear can serve.",https://www.latitudemedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Latitude-1920px-32-Image-2025-10-28T103754.820.jpg,N,,2025-10-28 12:05:38.197025

Washington, D.C. – A bipartisan group of more than a dozen governors released a package of reform priorities to improve federal permitting and regulatory processes for critical energy infrastructure projects. In a letter to congressional committee leaders, the governors called on Congress to enact reforms to ensure federal permitting processes are streamlined and administered in a technology-neutral and apolitical manner that allows energy projects of all types to move forward.

As working group co-chairs, NGA Chair Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt and Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro released the following statements.

“This isn’t a Republican or Democrat issue. Every American needs to heat their home and power their vehicle,” said Governor Stitt. “As the demand for energy rises as we bring new technologies and AI online, we need to complete energy infrastructure projects in a faster, more efficient way. I’m thankful to Governor Shapiro and our fellow Governors who participated in this task force for their innovative ideas to make American energy more accessible for everyone.”

“In Pennsylvania, we’re doubling down on our energy legacy by taking big, decisive steps to build new sources of power,” said Governor Shapiro. “My Administration has prioritized streamlining government to work for the people it serves and has responsibly sped up permitting to get new energy projects online and grow Pennsylvania’s economy. It’s far past time that we position the United States to do the same in order to win the energy and AI race, and lower energy costs for all Americans.”

Amid rising demand for electricity to serve computing, industrial, manufacturing, building and transportation needs, the governors developed reform recommendations across the following categories: Streamlining Federal Agency Reviews, Reforms to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), Reforms to Interstate Energy Transmission, Reforms to Nuclear Energy Regulation, and Reforms to the Clean Water Act.

The following Governors are participating in the Governors Energy and Infrastructure Working Group on behalf of all 55 states and territories:

Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt – NGA Chair, working group co-chair

Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro – working group co-chair

Maryland Governor Wes Moore – NGA Vice Chair

Colorado Governor Jared Polis

Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont

Indiana Governor Mike Braun

Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry

Massachusetts Governor Maura Healey

North Dakota Governor Kelly Armstrong

Rhode Island Governor Dan McKee

Tennessee Governor Bill Lee

Utah Governor Spencer Cox

Wyoming Governor Mark Gordon

“When it comes to energy infrastructure, we need to move from no and slow, to yes and now,” said NGA Vice Chair Governor Moore. “Permitting reform can help lower costs, modernize the electric grid, and create clean energy jobs for Maryland families. Commonsense energy policy is a bipartisan priority to get rid of government gridlock without sacrificing environmental safety. I’m proud of this bipartisan group of Governors for coming to the table and finding a set of commonsense solutions we believe can meet the moment.”

“I’m proud to have worked with my fellow governors to develop the pragmatic permitting reforms we need now,” said Governor Cox, former NGA Chair. “If we want to power new homes and businesses, strengthen the grid, and double our capacity, we have to build like we used to. Congress should move swiftly on these bipartisan proposals. It would be a major win for the American people.”

At NGA’s Winter Meeting in February 2025, Govs. Stitt and Shapiro announced the formation of the bipartisan working group. In Senate testimony on behalf of NGA in July, North Dakota Governor Kelly Armstrong advocated reforms.

Over the past several months, Govs. Stitt and Shapiro have co-chaired the group of governors, soliciting ideas for project acceleration and discussing the barriers at the state and federal level. While working group governors do not all endorse each specific reform, governors are in broad agreement on the need to improve federal energy permitting by incorporating new technologies and common interagency digital systems, broadening categorical exclusions, reforming certain litigation processes, and ensuring that federal agencies have the resources and staff needed to implement permitting reforms in a timely and technology neutral manner and end retroactive cancellation of permits.

Under the proposal, Louisiana insurers must provide a premium discount for mitigation projects that meet Fortified standards set by the Insurance Institute for Business and Home Safety.

The discount or rate reduction is required to fall within a 20% to 30% range, subject to regulator approval. Carriers may offer discounts outside this range if they provide actuarial justification and secure approval from state regulators.

The notice from the department states that while the reduced rates are intended to benefit policyholders, carriers that have not previously offered such discounts for mitigation projects could experience a decrease in revenue. The department is accepting public comments on the proposed regulations until Nov. 10.

Louisiana’s home hardening program, which began in 2023, was originally scheduled to end in 2025. Lawmakers made the program permanent last year and allocated an additional $15 million in funding.

According to Insurance Commissioner Tim Temple (pictured above), insurance reforms enacted by the Louisiana legislature in 2024 have contributed to stabilizing the market. Temple reported in March that 10 new homeowners insurers have entered the state, and both costs and the frequency of rate filings have declined.

He wrote his 17-page memo hoping to have an impact on next month’s United Nations climate change conference in Brazil.
Gates, whose foundation provides financial support for Associated Press coverage of health and development in Africa, is influential in the climate change conversation.
He expects his “tough truths about climate” memo will be controversial.
At the same time, money to help developing countries adapt to climate change is shrinking.","NEW YORK (AP) — Bill Gates thinks climate change is a serious problem but it won’t be the end of civilization. He thinks scientific innovation will curb it, and it’s instead time for a “strategic pivot” in the global climate fight: from focusing on limiting rising temperatures to fighting poverty and preventing disease.

A doomsday outlook has led the climate community to focus too much on near-term goals to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that cause warming, diverting resources from the most effective things that can be done to improve life in a warming world, Gates said. In a memo released Tuesday, Gates said the world’s primary goal should instead be to prevent suffering, particularly for those in the toughest conditions in the world’s poorest countries.

If given a choice between eradicating malaria and a tenth of a degree increase in warming, Gates told reporters, “I’ll let the temperature go up 0.1 degree to get rid of malaria. People don’t understand the suffering that exists today.”

The Microsoft co-founder spends most of his time now on the goals of the Gates Foundation, which has poured tens of billions of dollars into health care, education and development initiatives worldwide, including combating HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. He started Breakthrough Energy in 2015 to speed up innovation in clean energy.

He wrote his 17-page memo hoping to have an impact on next month’s United Nations climate change conference in Brazil. He’s urging world leaders to ask whether the little money designated for climate is being spent on the right things.

Gates, whose foundation provides financial support for Associated Press coverage of health and development in Africa, is influential in the climate change conversation. He expects his “tough truths about climate” memo will be controversial.

“If you think climate is not important, you won’t agree with the memo. If you think climate is the only cause and apocalyptic, you won’t agree with the memo,” Gates said during a roundtable discussion with reporters ahead of the release. “It’s kind of this pragmatic view of somebody who’s, you know, trying to maximize the money and the innovation that goes to help in these poor countries.”

Climate scientists say every fraction of a degree of warming matters

Every bit of additional warming correlates to more extreme weather, risks species extinction and brings the world closer to crossing tipping points where changes become irreversible, scientists say.

University of Washington public health and climate scientist Kristie Ebi said she thoroughly agrees with Gates that the U.N. negotiations should focus on improving human health and well-being. But, she said, Gates assumes the world stays static and only one variable changes — faster deployment of green technologies — to curb climate change. She called that unlikely.

Jeffrey Sachs, director of the Center for Sustainable Development at Columbia University, called the memo “pointless, vague, unhelpful and confusing.”

“There is no reason to pit poverty reduction versus climate transformation. Both are utterly feasible, and readily so, if the Big Oil lobby is brought under control,” he wrote in an email.

Stanford University climate scientist Chris Field said there is room for a healthy discussion about whether the current framing of the climate crisis is typically too pessimistic.

“But we should also invest for both the long term and the short term,” he wrote in an email. “A vibrant long-term future depends on both tackling climate change and supporting human development.”

Princeton University climate scientist Michael Oppenheimer said he doesn’t dispute the principle of making human well-being the primary objective of policy, but what about the natural world?

“Climate change is already wreaking havoc there,” he wrote in an email. “Can we truly live in a technological bubble? Do we want to?”

Gates is clear in his memo that every tenth of a degree of warming matters: “A stable climate makes it easier to improve people’s lives.”

Carbon dioxide pollution is increasing

A decade ago, the world agreed in a historic pact known as the Paris agreement to try to limit human-caused warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) since pre-industrial times. The goal: to stave off nastier heat waves, wildfires, storms and droughts.

In a 2021 book, Gates laid out a plan for reducing emissions to avoid a climate disaster. But humans are on track to release so much greenhouse gas by early 2028 that scientists say crossing that 1.5-degree threshold is now nearly unavoidable.

Breakthrough Energy focuses on areas where the cost of doing something cleanly is much higher than the polluting way, such as making clean steel and cement. Gates concluded his memo by saying governments should work toward driving this difference to zero, and be rigorous about measuring the impact of every effort in the world’s climate agenda.

Gates is optimistic innovation will curb climate change

Gates said the pace of innovation in clean energy has been faster than he expected, allowing cheap solar and wind energy to replace coal, oil and natural gas plants for electricity and averting worst-case warming scenarios. Artificial intelligence is helping accelerate advances in clean energy technologies, he added.

At the same time, money to help developing countries adapt to climate change is shrinking. Led by the United States, rich countries are cutting their foreign aid budgets. President Donald Trump has called climate change a hoax.

Gates criticized the aid cuts. He said Gavi, a public-private partnership started by his philanthropic foundation that buys vaccines, will have 25% less money for the next five years compared to the past five years. Gavi can save a life for a little more than $1,000, he added.

Vaccines become even more important in a warming world because children who aren’t dying of measles or whooping cough will be more likely to survive when a heat wave hits or a drought threatens the local food supply, he wrote.

Health and prosperity are the best defense against climate change, Gates said, citing research from the University of Chicago Climate Impact Lab that found projected deaths from climate change fall by more than 50% when accounting for the expected economic growth over the rest of this century.

Under these circumstances, he thinks the bar must be “very high” for what’s funded with aid money.

“If you have something that gets rid of 10,000 tons of emissions, that you’re spending several million dollars on,” he said, “that just doesn’t make the cut.”

Nevertheless, Los Angeles is pressing ahead with Scattergood — one of several projects that were part of the original statewide hydrogen push.","The Scattergood Generating Station in Los Angeles is an oceanfront natural-gas-burning relic that sits on the uncertain brink of a clean-energy showdown.

On Tuesday, the Los Angeles Board of Water and Power Commissioners will decide whether to advance a plan to shift the plant to futuristic hydrogen-ready turbines. The $800-million-plus retrofit is an anchor in California’s effort to boost hydrogen, a potentially clean fuel that for now remains costly, water-intensive and rarely produced without oil and gas.

But California’s high hopes for hydrogen — and the state’s investments in it as a potential economic driver in the era of clean energy — are at a crossroads.

Earlier this month, the Trump administration canceled $1.2 billion in federal funding for California’s hydrogen hub, a public-private partnership to build a clean hydrogen economy and support projects like Scattergood. The move followed a decision earlier this summer to scale back federal tax credits nationally for hydrogen.

California says it’s pressing ahead with hydrogen projects including Scattergood, with or without federal support.

“The state remains committed to developing a renewable hydrogen ecosystem,” said Willie Rudman, a spokesman for the Governor’s Office of Business and Economic Development, or GO-Biz, which led the creation of the hydrogen partnership. Clean hydrogen, Rudman added, “holds incredible potential as California continues its transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy.”

Critics say that optimism ignores real costs and trade-offs.

A bold investment, an uncertain climate

California politicians have chased hydrogen for decades, seeking environmental and economic benefits. In 2004, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger famously rolled out a hydrogen-powered Hummer and ordered a “Hydrogen Highway” of fueling stations.

The state’s most recent bid – an ambitious hydrogen hub – has been its boldest investment yet.

In 2022, Gov. Gavin Newsom launched the Alliance for Renewable Clean Hydrogen Energy Systems, or ARCHES — a partnership led by GO-Biz, the University of California, and the State Building and Construction Trades Council. It now counts more than four hundred public- and private-sector partners, including Chevron and other energy companies.

Most hydrogen today comes from natural gas — a carbon-intensive process that undercuts its climate appeal. Over time, ARCHES hopes to help industry swap that process for “green” hydrogen made by splitting water with renewable power, an expensive and elusive process.

Newsom has embraced hydrogen as both climate and economic policy.

“Scaling this in California isn’t just about addressing the climate crisis — it’s also about creating hundreds of thousands of jobs,” Newsom wrote in August 2023. He directed his administration to develop an “all-of-government Hydrogen Market Development Strategy,” similar to what California had done for electric cars.

ARCHES won up to $1.2 billion in federal funding from the Department of Energy as part of a $12.6 billion total statewide hydrogen hub. The award positioned California at the center of the nation’s ambitions for clean hydrogen — until the Trump administration abruptly withdrew funding Oct. 1.

Newsom blasted the move as political and “common sense be damned.” While California lost its funding, several hydrogen hubs in Republican-led states kept theirs. California has appealed the decision.

State Sen. Anna Caballero, a Democrat from Merced who authored a law speeding approval of hydrogen projects last year, said she expects talks next session on using cap-and-trade funds to keep the hydrogen hub alive. Private and international investors, she added, remain interested in California’s market.

“People in my district are asking for good jobs as we make this transition — and they’re looking for clean air — and hydrogen has the capacity to do all of the above,” Caballero said. “We have the opportunity, and I’d like to see us explore it.”

Not everyone was disappointed by the loss of the California funding. Some environmental groups, concerned about encouraging fossil fuels and the potential for explosions, welcomed the federal cancellation. Nevertheless, Los Angeles is pressing ahead with Scattergood — one of several projects that were part of the original statewide hydrogen push.

Why LA is betting on hydrogen

Until a few weeks ago, ARCHES, the state’s hydrogen hub, was expected to contribute at least $100 million to the Scattergood retrofit.

“Our understanding is that the federal dollars are not coming in,” said Jason Rondou, assistant general manager of power planning and operations for the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. “We don’t know yet if there will be another mechanism to make up that $100 million.”

Still, the largest municipal utility in the country is seeking approval from its board for the Scattergood conversion, calling it a step toward the city’s goal of fossil-free power by 2035 and the state’s similar goal, with a deadline a decade later.

Utility officials say the Scattergood upgrade is necessary because its aging gas turbines are inefficient, dirty and cooled with seawater — a process now banned under state policy because of its impact on marine life. The plan is to replace the old turbines with a new combined-cycle unit designed to burn a blend of hydrogen and natural gas.

The goal is to make Scattergood more of a “peaker” plant — one that can fire up and cycle down to match demand surges, rather than running around the clock. But environmentalists are concerned about a project that runs on “green” hydrogen when it isn’t readily available at scale. The retrofit would keep the plant running on natural gas, with LADWP reserving the option to blend in as much as 30% hydrogen if the fuel becomes available and affordable.

“You’re spending a lot of money on a technology that doesn’t currently exist,” said Julia Dowell, a Long Beach-based organizer with the Sierra Club, who’s led opposition to the Scattergood plan. “We don’t really know when it will come to fruition — if at all.”

For now, this is a natural gas plant, said Dan Esposito, a hydrogen expert with the clean energy think tank Energy Innovation. “In a place with high local air pollution, in a place that has these high clean energy goals … should we be building a new gas plant if there are other clean technologies that we can invest in that we have more certainty will deliver on those clean energy targets? It’s a very tough question.”

In a recent analysis, the city’s ratepayer advocate said the financial setback “doesn’t close the door on clean hydrogen” but nevertheless raises questions about who ultimately pays for the project — and how the utility will balance its clean-energy goals with affordability.

The risks ahead

LA’s water and power commissioners are likely to approve Scattergood’s modernization on Tuesday. The vote won’t start construction, but it will clear the way for the city’s department of water and power to seek builders and finalize designs.

The decision also points up a tough question for California’s hydrogen strategy: without federal support, are public agencies investing scarce climate dollars in the right places?

Scattergood’s environmental review drew nearly 100 comments from residents, neighboring cities and advocacy groups.

The city of El Segundo warned that emissions and construction traffic could spill across its borders. Business groups backed the plan as a source of jobs and grid reliability. Meanwhile environmental groups warned of harms both locally and beyond.

Building even one major hydrogen project like Scattergood means committing to an entire network of pipelines, storage and supply.

“An investment in hydrogen comes with an opportunity cost,” said Alex Jasset, director of energy justice at Physicians for Social Responsibility Los Angeles, who opposes the project. “We’re dumping a lot of our very limited resources for addressing the climate crisis into an inefficient, expensive option when we could be instead investing in cheaper, more scalable, more immediate benefits.”

Jasset said that the infrastructure for hydrogen projects will mostly be paid for by Californians – through taxes, utility bills, or state business fees. And if those projects fall short, they risk prolonging fossil-fuel infrastructure in neighborhoods already burdened by pollution.

Esposito, the analyst at Energy Innovation, says the Trump Administration’s cancellation of the hydrogen hub award, and the loss of federal credits, might offer a silver lining.

“There was so much money for hydrogen, and so much excitement, that we were frankly at risk of making a lot of bad decisions,” Esposito said. “There were all these proposals that were coming out that were not on solid financial ground — and needed these big subsidies — and then a lot of this money dried up overnight.”

As Los Angeles considers its major project, Esposito added, the state’s hydrogen boosters are getting something essential: a reality check. The challenge now is whether that clarity can guide smarter investments — and a more sustainable path forward.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-47635/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/031722-scattergood-power-plant-getty-cm1761705919.jpg?h=56d0ca2e&itok=35mEMyjc,N,,2025-10-28 22:58:11.152651

The two-day forum, organised by the Rural Electrification Agency (REA) in partnership with the National Agency for Science and Engineering Infrastructure (NASENI) and supported by the Alliance for Rural Electrification (ARE), gathered stakeholders from across government, industry, and the private sector to accelerate the country’s transition from energy consumer to clean energy producer.

Driving the “Nigeria First” Vision

Vice President Kashim Shettima reaffirmed the Federal Government’s commitment to transforming Nigeria into Africa’s renewable energy hub. He underscored that local manufacturing must sit at the heart of this transition, not only as a matter of industrial strategy but as a means to create jobs, stabilise the naira, and ensure long-term energy security.

“Our goal is not just to install renewable energy systems,” Shettima stated. “It is to build them here, from the solar panels to the batteries that power our communities.”

This vision aligns with the administration’s Renewed Hope Agenda, which seeks to strengthen the domestic value chain for solar modules, batteries, and smart meters while fostering public–private partnerships that can turn Nigeria’s manufacturing potential into tangible output.

Key Stakeholders Shaping the Conversation

Rural Electrification Agency (REA): As organiser and secretariat, the REA framed NREIF 2025 around policy-to-practice outcomes. It presented updates on national anchor programmes, including the National Public Sector Solarisation Initiative (NPSSI) and the Distributed Access through Renewable Energy Scale-up project (DARES), designed to stimulate local manufacturing through large-scale solar deployment.

National Agency for Science and Engineering Infrastructure (NASENI): NASENI’s role at the forum was symbolic and practical. Its presence demonstrated that Nigeria already has the technical base to drive indigenous production. Through its ongoing research, engineering design, and manufacturing programmes, NASENI continues to pioneer locally made solar home systems, panels, inverters, and batteries, which is concrete proof that Made in Nigeria renewable technologies are not a distant aspiration.

Federal Ministry of Power (MoP): The Honourable Minister, Adebayo Adelabu, launched two key instruments at the forum: the Nigerian Green Manufacturing Investment Prospectus and the REA Harmonised Technical Standards. These instruments guide investors, clarify quality benchmarks, and formalise local-content pathways.

Federal Ministry of Industry, Trade and Investment (FMITI) and Nigerian Investment Promotion Commission (NIPC): Both institutions are committed to aligning fiscal incentives, trade measures, and investor engagement strategies with renewable manufacturing objectives, signalling stronger policy coherence.

Private Sector Partners: Local and international players, including Sun King, Hinckley Recycling Ltd, and members of the Solar Energy Manufacturers and Assemblers Association (SEMA), showcased business models and technologies that reinforce domestic value-chain development and circular-economy integration.

State Governments: State governments also took centre stage, pledging to champion renewable industrial clusters that promote manufacturing and energy access at the subnational level. Their involvement underscores the shared responsibility of building Nigeria’s renewable energy economy from the ground up.

Exhibition Spotlight: From Display to Factory Floor

Beyond the policy discussions, the exhibition hall at NREIF 2025 vividly demonstrated Nigeria’s emerging manufacturing capacity. Rows of booths showcased locally developed products, solar modules, batteries, irrigation systems, and energy management tools, evidence that the country is already moving from concept to production.

At the heart of the exhibition was NASENI’s display of state-of-the-art renewable energy technologies, including solar home systems, portable solar units, and solar-powered irrigation systems. The Minister of Power, Adebayo Adelabu, who toured the NASENI booth, emphasised that the future of clean energy in Nigeria must be designed, assembled, and built in Nigeria.

In addition, the exhibition floor buzzed with cross-sector collaboration, investors exploring partnerships, engineers explaining design processes, and government officials engaging with manufacturers on policy alignment. Local firms displayed innovation and craftsmanship, while foreign OEMs sought joint ventures and technology transfer opportunities.

Furthermore, the exhibition turned Nigeria’s manufacturing narrative from abstract policy to tangible proof. What stood on display was not just energy hardware, but the future of industrial self-sufficiency.

“The exhibition may have lasted two days,” one participant noted, “but it represents decades of progress in motion; what’s displayed here today will be rolling off factory lines tomorrow.”

Notable Projects and Agreements Signed

The forum’s Deal Room produced tangible results. According to the official communiqué, over USD 435 million in investment commitments were secured, alongside a series of strategic MoUs aimed at deepening local manufacturing:

REA × Six State Governments (Lagos, Ogun, Akwa Ibom, Kano, Bayelsa & FCT):

Partnerships to deliver renewable energy manufacturing clusters and localised deployment projects, with a combined initial capacity target of 4,000 MW.

1 GW Solar Panel Manufacturing Facility (REA, InfraCorp & Solarge BV):

A joint venture initiative was announced to establish a 1 gigawatt solar-panel plant with a 50 per cent local-content target within three years, positioning Nigeria as a regional production centre.

Sun King × REA Light Manufacturing Agreement:

Commitment to establish a Nigerian footprint for solar appliances and efficient lighting systems, complementing ongoing rural-electrification projects.

Private-sector commitments:

Several local companies pledged to localise smart-meter and battery-recycling operations, while Hinckley Recycling Ltd underscored plans to integrate e-waste recovery into Nigeria’s renewable manufacturing policy.

Next Steps: Turning Commitments into Capacity

Meanwhile, with the policy momentum, partnerships, and investment interest now building, stakeholders outlined a clear roadmap for the post-NREIF era. Forum participants adopted a collective resolution to:

Prioritise local-content obligations across all renewable programmes.

Scale green-finance instruments such as blended-finance vehicles, green bonds, and carbon-credit mechanisms.

Expand vocational and apprenticeship programmes around manufacturing clusters.

Pursue regional export strategies to position Nigeria as a supplier of renewable-energy components within ECOWAS.

Institutionalise digital data platforms to improve procurement transparency and investor confidence.

As the communiqué puts it, “The transition from pilot projects to industrial scale requires urgency, coordination, and measurable commitments.”

Conclusion: From Vision to Value

The Nigeria Renewable Energy Innovation Forum 2025 bridged the gap between ambition and execution, between showcasing innovation and manufacturing it at scale. With a 1 GW solar-manufacturing joint venture, six state-level partnerships, and over $435 million in new investment pledges, the foundations of a Made in Nigeria Energy Revolution are being laid.

If the implementation roadmap stays on course, the following forum in 2026 may well showcase Nigeria as a market for renewable technologies and Africa’s leading manufacturer and exporter of clean energy solutions.",https://theelectricityhub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/NREIF-20-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-28 12:05:28.437586

Significant changes to the Inflation Reduction Act through the One Big Beautiful Bill Act are set to reshape energy project development, financing strategies and long-term investment planning.

Through revised deadlines, restructured tax credits and new foreign entity restrictions, the OBBBA compresses the window for clean energy incentives and introduces heightened compliance burdens.

Project developers must now navigate stricter timelines, reassess supply chains and evaluate which projects remain financially viable in this new environment. This article outlines how these changes affect various technologies, and what developers and investors should be doing now.

What are the most significant changes for energy projects stemming from the revisions to the Inflation Reduction Act?

The most significant change is the imposition of a hard deadline for the IRA's technology-neutral tax credits: the clean energy production credit, under Section 45Y of the Internal Revenue Code, and the clean energy investment credit, under Section 48E.

Under the OBBBA, projects must either begin construction by July 4, 2026, or be placed in service by Dec. 31, 2027, to remain eligible for the tax credits.

This change is particularly consequential for developers in the early planning or permitting stages, many of which may now struggle to meet the accelerated timelines. In addition, their financial models, which were almost certainly based on the IRA's longer-term credits, may not be reliable.

By contrast, projects that are already placed in service and claiming credits under the original IRA rules are generally considered safe.

A second major change involves foreign entity of concern, or FEOC, rules. These rules operate in two key ways: (1) by disqualifying a project if the taxpayer itself is a prohibited foreign entity, and (2) by disqualifying projects based on their supply chains.

Projects beginning construction after Dec. 31 of this year that receive material assistance from prohibited foreign entities — such as those with ties to China, Russia, Iran or North Korea — will be disqualified from receiving the Section 45Y or Section 48E credits.

The definition of ""material assistance"" can include sourcing of key components, financing or licensing of intellectual property. For example, a solar project that begins construction in January 2026 and sources modules from a Chinese supplier would be ineligible for the tax credits.

The law directs the U.S. Department of the Treasury to issue guidance on how to determine compliance based on cost thresholds, but until then, developers face significant uncertainty in structuring supply chains and financing.

How might the revised tax credit structures influence financing strategies and investment decisions in wind, solar, and battery storage projects?

The compressed window for eligibility will have immediate implications for financing strategies for wind and solar projects. Tax equity investors — already a limited and cautious pool — are likely to narrow their focus to projects that can reasonably begin construction by July 4, 2026.

As a result, developers may need to secure financing earlier and at higher premiums, or shift toward alternative capital stacks that include direct equity or state-level incentive programs — i.e., in states with their own energy tax credits.

The loss of long-term certainty will particularly affect merchant projects that depend heavily on the decreasing value of federal credits. Many such projects may be paused, downsized or abandoned altogether, while utility-backed projects with secured offtake may continue — albeit with tighter financial margins.

While the OBBBA creates a compressed timeline for solar and wind projects under Section 45Y and 48E, battery storage projects are somewhat less affected by these timing changes. But they may still be affected by the FEOC supply chain restrictions.

Stand-alone storage projects, or storage projects installed with a wind or solar facility, that begin construction by the end of 2033 will retain full eligibility for the Section 48E investment tax credit, providing a measure of certainty and continuity.

As a result, financing strategies for battery storage may shift dramatically. Instead of a calendar race, financing will now be contingent on a developer's ability to prove a secure, FEOC-compliant supply chain.

In what ways does the budget affect the role of nuclear energy in the U.S. power sector?

The OBBBA leaves the role of nuclear energy in the U.S. power sector largely intact — and comparatively strengthened. While it shortens eligibility for wind and solar tax credits, it preserves full access to the tech-neutral production and investment tax credits, under Sections 45Y and 48E, for nuclear projects beginning construction by the end of 2033.

In addition, the OBBBA creates a new 10% tax credit bonus applicable to the Section 45Y production tax credit for advanced nuclear facilities, based on nuclear-related employment in the applicable metropolitan statistical area.

More significantly, the bill provides a major new financing tool by making income from advanced nuclear facilities eligible for the tax-advantaged master limited partnership structure, providing greater access to public capital markets and potentially reducing financing costs.

As other technologies face compressed credit windows and stricter sourcing rules, nuclear energy now occupies a more stable and advantageous position.

However, the OBBBA also introduces significant new compliance risks for the industry through FEOC restrictions. The zero-emission nuclear production credit, under Section 45U, a key incentive for the existing fleet of nuclear reactors, is now subject to these rules.

A nuclear plant may lose its credit eligibility if its owner is defined as a ""specified foreign entity"" or a ""foreign-influenced entity."" The prohibition on specified foreign entities is effective immediately, and the prohibition on foreign-influenced entities begins two years after enactment of the OBBBA — i.e., July 4, 2027.

Since foreign-influenced entity status can be based on ownership, debt or governance, developers and project owners will need time to assess and address potential violations.

How should developers and investors adjust their timelines or strategies in light of the revised credit qualification deadlines?

Developers and investors should triage their portfolios into three groups: (1) the projects in development that are already safe-harbored; (2) the projects that can realistically be accelerated to meet the July 4, 2026, beginning-of-construction deadline; and (3) the projects that cannot meet the deadline.

For projects in the second group, consider how to best allocate resources for supply chain procurement — from non-FEOC sources — and preconstruction activities in order to qualify for the beginning-of-construction deadline.

President Donald Trump, in a July 7 executive order, directed the Treasury Department to — by mid-August — issue new and revised guidance that will ""strictly enforce"" the termination of the energy credits. As a result, developers and investors should anticipate more stringent requirements for when a project begins construction than those provided in IRS Notices 2018-59 and 2013-29.

For projects in the third group, consider their financial viability without federal credits — and potential penalties from a cancellation or revision of the project's scope.

A top priority for all projects is to audit and potentially restructure supply chains to ensure that their suppliers are compliant with the new FEOC rules, particularly as developers await stricter beginning-of-construction guidance from the Treasury.

How do the new provisions affect financing opportunities and incentives for coal, oil, and gas projects, and what might this mean for the long-term energy investment landscape?

The OBBBA contains several new programs that dispatchable energy producers could take advantage of. For example, one of the new incentives provides 100% bonus depreciation for what it calls ""qualified production property"" that is placed in service by Dec. 31, 2030, with construction beginning before Jan. 1, 2029.

Property qualifying for this incentive may include factories, processing sites, or utility or refinery infrastructure used in manufacturing, production or refining of tangible personal property such as oil, coal or natural gas. The OBBBA also creates a 2.5% production cost incentive for metallurgical coal produced before Jan. 1, 2030.

In addition, Title V of the OBBBA mandates dozens of new onshore and offshore oil and gas lease sales, directs new coal leasing at temporarily reduced royalty rates, and enhances the Section 45Q tax credit for carbon capture at conventional power plants.

In the near term, these incentives may encourage increased capital flows into brownfield expansions, field redevelopments and midstream upgrades — particularly in states supportive of coal, oil and gas development.

Conclusion

The OBBBA marks a fundamental shift in federal energy policy, moving away from the broad, long-term support for renewables in the IRA toward a more targeted and restrictive framework. For the energy sector, the near-term takeaways are relatively clear.

First, for wind and solar developers, the new deadlines create an urgent need for speed, fundamentally changing how projects are timed and financed. Second, for technologies like battery storage and nuclear, the primary challenge now lies not with the calendar, but with navigating a complex maze of new supply chain restrictions designed to limit foreign influence.

Finally, the OBBBA creates a distinctly more favorable investment landscape for fossil fuel energy, not only by curbing incentives for its renewable competitors but also by providing new, direct financial benefits for oil, gas and coal. The long-term result will be a reshaped energy investment map, with new risks and opportunities for every sector.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15545_544.jpg,N,,2025-10-28 11:00:27.436473

“Reusable and refillable alternatives offer a sustainable solution — one that an overwhelming majority of U.S. voters support through increased use of reusable packaging and foodware.
“Reusable packaging is a proven, scalable solution to the plastic pollution crisis.","WASHINGTON— More than 180 recycling and reuse companies, environmental education organizations, and plastic pollution, climate justice, and environmental organizations from across the country are calling on legislators to support the Research for Environmental Uses and Sustainable Economies (REUSE) Act of 2025.

The REUSE Act, introduced by Oregon’s U.S. Senator Jeff Merkley and West Virginia’s U.S. Senator Shelley Moore Capito, would direct the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to conduct a feasibility study on reuse and refill systems in different sectors, such as consumer packaging, personal care products, and wholesale shipping of retail goods.

In a letter sent to every U.S. senator today, signatories urged lawmakers to cosponsor the REUSE Act to address the global crisis that alters entire ecosystems, kneecaps the ability to fight climate change, and affects the health and livelihoods of millions of people.

The REUSE Act also directs the EPA to assess how local, state and federal governments can support reuse and refill systems. Under the bill, the agency would also evaluate workforce development opportunities. This critical data will help stakeholders harness the environmental benefits and economic potential of reuse and refill systems.

“While we know reuse is necessary to stop the plastic crisis that's choking our environment, this research could show us how to scale it in an equitable, community-led way,” said Kelley Dennings, a senior campaigner at the Center for Biological Diversity. “Reuse is a chance to engage worker-owned businesses in transforming waste management in a way that puts people first, keeps costs low, protects the environment, and supports Main Street instead of Wall Street.”

Reuse delivers meaningful economic benefits. U.S. communities currently spend $11.5 billion on litter cleanups each year, with foodservice packaging accounting for 67% of that cost. Reuse systems reduce these costs while also creating jobs. Reuse programs can generate more than 30 times more jobs than disposal facilities, which is more than double the number created by recycling.

Every day the equivalent of 2,000 garbage trucks full of plastic waste are dumped into the world’s oceans and waterways. Of the 40 million tons of plastic waste generated in the U.S. in 2021, only 5% to 6% — or about 2 million tons — was recycled. Instead, more Americans are rejecting single-use plastic and embracing reusable alternatives for packaging, foodware and shipping.

“As the plastic pollution crisis intensifies, we see growing consequences for our oceans and our health,” said Christy Leavitt, senior campaign director at Oceana. “Reusable and refillable alternatives offer a sustainable solution — one that an overwhelming majority of U.S. voters support through increased use of reusable packaging and foodware. We call on senators on both sides of the aisle to support the bipartisan REUSE Act, led by Senators Merkley and Capito.”

Reuse offers a pathway to systemic change, preventing the crisis from worsening and building a more sustainable economy. This can include reusable to-go containers, shampoo bottles, cleaning products or shipping boxes.

“Reusable packaging is a proven, scalable solution to the plastic pollution crisis. It not only slashes waste and carbon emissions but also helps prevent the generation of microplastics, one of the most persistent and harmful forms of pollution once released into our environment,” said Paulita Bennett-Martin, senior strategist for policy initiatives at The 5 Gyres Institute. “With more than 181 organizations joining this call to action, this legislation marks a critical, bipartisan step toward protecting our planet, safeguarding public health, and building a stronger, more sustainable economy.”",https://www.biologicaldiversity.org/news/press_releases/images/center-frog-logo-300.jpg,N,,2025-10-28 10:59:37.198316

The Michigan Public Service Commission took public comment Tuesday on guidelines for its integrated resource plan, offering residents a chance to weigh in on the state’s energy future during a hearing at Oakland Community College’s Auburn Hills Campus.

“It’s the spooky season, but the scariest thing in Michigan right now is AI data center’s threat to the Great Lakes state,” said Michelle Martinez, the inaugural director of the Tishman Center for Social Justice and the Environment at the University of Michigan during a rally held ahead of the meeting.

Data centers house servers, storage devices and other pieces of online infrastructure. They are considered essential for artificial intelligence and have contributed to a significant increase in demand for electricity across the nation due to their continuous, energy intensive operations, and similarly demand large amounts of water for cooling.

While the Legislature approved tax incentives for data centers in 2024 in a bid to court investments into Michigan communities, Martinez warned that failing to act will sacrifice water resources, balloon energy costs and risk accelerating climate change.

Martinez pointed to an analysis from Bloomberg News which found that energy prices had increased 267% within five years in areas located near data centers, warning that Michigan communities could face a similar threat, with seniors and people with disabilities particularly at risk.

Christy McGillivray, the executive director of Voters Not Politicians slammed the Legislature for moving forward with incentives for data centers without protections for ratepayers, while Andrea Pierce, the policy director for the Michigan Environmental Justice Coalition warned these facilities could deplete groundwater aquifers and disrupt ecosystems through thermal pollution of surface waters, alongside pollution with PFAS, methane and other harmful chemicals.

“The only way to protect our water is through airtight regulations at every level, including the MPSC,” Pierce said.

Through its integrated resource plan, the Public Service Commission should require utilities to plan within water limits, Pierce said, factoring in cooling water needs, growing demand from various industries and climate-adjusted water scenarios.

The commission’s chair, Dan Scripps spoke with reporters ahead of the meeting. He noted that the commission is currently weighing consumer concerns in a contested case with Consumers Energy intended to protect ratepayers from the additional costs brought on by data centers, telling reporters he expected those issues would be addressed on a utility by utility basis.

When asked what role the commission could play in looking at the water use associated with energy generated for data centers, Scripps said that was not a role the Legislature had given them.

However, when asked about the extent of the commission’s ability to institute air and water protections, Scripps noted there are statutes barring residential, industrial and commercial energy customers from shifting costs from one customer class to another. He also pointed to clean energy laws passed in 2023 – with one law instructing the commission to weigh factors like equity, environmental justice, affordability, public health and more when reviewing energy companies’ operations plans – as another piece of those considerations.

During the hearing, residents continued to raise concerns that a proliferation of data centers would bring additional costs to ratepayers and derail the state’s goal to meet a 100% clean energy standard by 2040.

Mikal Goodman, a member of the Pontiac City Council, stressed the importance of energy affordability and the environmental impact of expanding energy infrastructure, particularly as it affects low income residents and communities of color.

He noted that many Michigan communities still have lead water lines, raising further concerns about the ability of Pontiac and communities like Detroit and Benton Harbor to access clean water should data centers open up nearby.

“If our city of Pontiac is not able to get clean and affordable drinking water on a regular basis, that is a catastrophic outcome beyond the decades of disinvestment that have already happened,” Goodman noted.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-86/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_6801-1024x6831761658400.jpg?h=199d8c1f&itok=putoasMs,N,,2025-10-28 13:12:58.686453

There are no job creation or retention commitments being made for the plant, which employs around 1,100 people, said Erik Wilford, managing director of business development projects for the MEDC. However, American Axle is hopeful the investments will spur new contract awards.

The Three Rivers facility competes with one in Mexico for work, and tariffs are driving new opportunities to land reinvestment in Michigan plants, Wilford added.

“The facilities are constantly competing on OEM projects and programs, so this investment in this facility puts them in a position … to help win new programs with companies,” Wilford said during a media briefing.

In 2021, the company invested $41 million into the Three Rivers plant and added 100 jobs to boost production of front and rear axles and disconnecting all-wheel-drive systems.

American Axle, which manufactures driveline components and axles, counts GM as its largest account. The automaker announced in June plans to invest $4 billion in U.S. production, including an electric vehicle reversal at Orion Assembly, where it will instead build gasoline-powered pickups and Cadillac SUVs starting in early 2027.

GM makes light-duty pickups and SUVs in Mexico, where it operates four plants. The company has not detailed how production plans south of the border would be impacted by the manufacturing move to the U.S.

Automakers generally want their suppliers to manufacture nearby final assembly plants. “Localizing” supply chains is a top priority for automakers as they work to blunt the impact of tariffs and avoid supply chain crises like the microchip shortage.

American Axle spokesman Chris Son said the investment ""supports facility and production line improvements to improve the facility’s standards and competitiveness.""

The auto supplier's planned investment in Michigan comes as it looks to bring its $1.44 billion acquisition of British peer Dowlais Group over the finish line. The deal is on track to close in the first quarter as the company works to achieve regulatory approvals, according to a Monday news release.

“The company has taken steps to bolster its manufacturing capacity in the United States, to align with the growing importance of onshoring manufacturing as a result of shifting global economic forces,” the MEDC memo stated. “The company’s investment into the facility in Three Rivers will be transformational and will provide comfort to its business partners in the automotive industry to bring home their production lines.”",https://s3-rd-prod.crainsdetroit.com/styles/1200x630/s3/american%20axle.jpg,N,,2025-10-28 12:06:12.750440

The findings quantify for the first time how the political actions of the world’s wealthiest person – including his role in U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration – may have cost Tesla billions in lost vehicle sales while benefiting rival electric carmakers.

Tesla’s U.S. sales would have been between 67% and 83% higher, or about 1 million to 1.26 million additional vehicles, from October 2022 to April 2025, had it not been for what researchers call the “Musk partisan effect,” according to a working paper from the National Bureau of Economic Research by Yale University economists.

Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the report.

As Democratic-leaning buyers shifted away from Tesla, that effect also boosted the sales of competitors’ electric and hybrid vehicles by roughly 17% to 22%, the study found.

The Yale University researchers linked the drop to Musk’s increasingly partisan behavior, including his roughly $300 million in donations to Republican candidates as well as leadership of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) under Trump.

Musk’s political stance has alienated environmentally-minded Democratic buyers – historically Tesla’s strongest base – according to surveys cited in the report.

Sentiment toward Tesla improved somewhat as Musk pivoted the company towards robotaxis, self-driving technology and robots in human form.

Tesla board Chair Robyn Denholm said in an interview with CNBC on Monday that the outside perception of Musk spending time in the U.S. government had diminished.

The NBER paper said Musk’s actions also hampered California’s progress toward its zero-emissions vehicle goals, concluding that the state would likely have met its 2026 targets “had it not been for the Musk partisan effect.”

Registrations of Tesla cars in the state fell 9.4% in the third quarter, with its market share falling to 46.2% in the three-month period.

Cameco Corporation (TSX: CCO; NYSE: CCJ) today announced that it, along with Brookfield Asset Management (Brookfield), has entered into a binding term sheet with the United States Department of Commerce (US Government) to establish a strategic partnership, which is expected to accelerate the global deployment of Westinghouse Electric Company’s (Westinghouse) nuclear reactor technologies and reinvigorate supply chains and the nuclear power industrial base in the US and abroad.

The agreement provides for the US Government to arrange financing and facilitate the permitting and approvals for new Westinghouse nuclear reactors to be built in the US, with an aggregate investment value of at least US$80 billion, including near-term financing of long lead time items. Once constructed, the reactors are expected to generate reliable and secure power for the American grid, including powering significant data center and compute capacity to drive growth in artificial intelligence in the United States.

“We are pleased to see the US government make this commitment to expanding nuclear power capacity using Westinghouse's proven technology. We expect that our highly successful partnership with Brookfield as owners of Westinghouse will be further strengthened through this strategic collaboration with the US Government,” said Tim Gitzel, CEO of Cameco. “At the center of this new partnership is value creation. When coupled with the May 23, 2025 Executive Orders, we believe the US Government’s participation in the partnership creates the right incentives to deploy its full suite of tools behind the construction of Westinghouse reactors, including financial, regulatory, policy and diplomatic support. That support is expected to drive additional value for the partnership and the many stakeholders who are expected to benefit from enhanced energy, national and climate security around the world.

“We expect that the new build commitments from the US will bolster broader confidence in the durable growth profile for nuclear power, and support increased demand for Westinghouse’s and Cameco’s products, services and technologies. This new partnership highlights the role that Westinghouse’s reactor technologies, based on fully designed, licensed and operating reactors, are expected to play in the planned expansion of nuclear capacity and diversification of global nuclear supply chains. Cameco remains well positioned as a secure and reliable supplier that can fuel the long-term reliable operation of Westinghouse’s technology in the US and globally.”

The launch of a nuclear power plant construction program is expected to accelerate growth in Westinghouse’s energy systems segment during the construction phase, along with its core fuel fabrication and reactor services business for the life of the reactors. Upon closing of the transaction and with financing facilitated by the US Government, Westinghouse plans to commence project execution and initiate orders for critical equipment with long lead times, which is expected to leverage the nuclear industry supply chains that were established during the construction of Vogtle units 3 and 4.

Cameco, as one of the world’s largest and most reliable suppliers of uranium and nuclear fuel services and components, is well-positioned with what is expected to be tremendous upside optionality to benefit from the continued expansion of nuclear power in the US and globally, through the anticipated acceleration of nuclear fuel demand growth as a result of this partnership.

Partnership Structure

Under the new strategic partnership, the US Government will be granted a participation interest (Participation Interest), which, once vested, will entitle it to receive 20% of any cash distributions in excess of US$17.5 billion made by Westinghouse after the granting of the Participation Interest. For the Participation Interest to vest, the US Government must make a final investment decision and enter into definitive agreements to complete the construction of new Westinghouse nuclear reactors in the US with an aggregate value of at least US$80 billion.

Additionally, in recognition of the anticipated acceleration of long-term value creation that the US Government is expected to help unlock by deploying its financial, regulatory, policy and diplomatic tools to support the objectives of the partnership, if, on or prior to January 2029 the Participation Interest has vested, and if the valuation in an initial public offering (IPO) of Westinghouse is expected to be US$30 billion or more at that time, the US Government will be entitled to require an (IPO). Immediately prior to, or in connection with the IPO, the Participation Interest will directly or indirectly convert into a warrant, with a five-year term, to purchase equity securities equivalent to 20% of the public value of the IPO entity at the time of exercise after deducting US$17.5 billion from the public value.

Brookfield and Cameco acquired Westinghouse in November 2023. The partnership brought together Cameco’s expertise in the nuclear fuel supply chain with Brookfield’s recognized position as one of the world’s largest investors in energy generation technologies.

The transactions and other matters contemplated by the term sheet with the US Government are subject to, among other risks, the factors discussed below under Forward Looking Information. The expectation is that the US Government, Brookfield, Cameco and Westinghouse will negotiate and enter into definitive agreements replacing the binding term sheet, but, in the event such agreements are not reached, the term sheet will remain effective.

The transactions are subject to obtaining required regulatory approvals and the satisfaction of other customary conditions.

The agreement with the U.S. government involves construction of at least $80 billion worth of new Westinghouse nuclear reactors across the country, according to Cameco.

Cameco owns a 49% interest in Westinghouse. Its partner, Brookfield Asset Management (BAM), owns the remaining 51%.

A press release noted that the partnership ""contains profit-sharing mechanisms that provide for all parties, including the American people, once certain thresholds are met, to participate in the long-term financial and strategic value that will be created within Westinghouse by the growth of nuclear energy and advancement of investment into AI capabilities in the United States.""

""This partnership embodies the bold vision of President Trump – to rebuild our energy sovereignty, create high-paying jobs, and drive America to the forefront of the nuclear renaissance,"" Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick said in the press release Tuesday.

""Our highly successful partnership with Brookfield as owners of Westinghouse will be further strengthened through this collaboration with the U.S. government,"" Cameco CEO Tim Gitzel said Tuesday.

""We expect this new partnership to support the global growth opportunities for both Westinghouse's and Cameco's nuclear products, services and technologies, adding significant long-term value for our stakeholders and enhancing energy, national and climate security around the world,"" Gitzel added.

The 'Unprecedented' Opportunity That's Driving Cameco To Fresh Highs

Westinghouse Role Already Hinted At

In June, William Blair analyst Jed Dorsheimer wrote that Westinghouse was the ""top pick"" for the construction of the 10 new large nuclear reactors by 2030. Trump mandated those projects in his recent executive orders.

The Financial Times reported in June that Westinghouse was in talks with U.S. officials and industry partners to deploy its AP1000 nuclear reactor to meet this goal. The publication put a $74 billion price tag on the expansion.

""This comes as no surprise to us,"" Dorsheimer said at the time. ""Westinghouse is the last standing U.S. manufacturer of large-scale light-water reactors and a front-runner to be the manufacturer.""

Nuclear Stocks And Uranium: Executive Orders Vs. Economics

Following the deal announcement Tuesday, Dorsheimer wrote in an analyst note that it is ""unclear how"" the $80 billion in funding ""will be provided or spent"" but that based on the Vogtle's price tag of $37 billion for the last two reactors, ""$80 billion is about four reactors' worth.""

""We expect significant cost-downs given the overhaul of the NRC and dethatching of the regulatory morass, so we believe the government is willing to fund all 10 AP1000 builds. The key part is the partnership structure, which features a clause allowing the U.S. to force an IPO of the Westinghouse business if the value exceeds $30 billion, with the U.S. receiving a 20% stake. We believe this is the long-term outcome the U.S. is planning for,"" Dorsheimer said.

Brookfield Keeps Nuclear Focus

This is also the latest sign that Brookfield Asset Management is capitalizing on its role in the nuclear energy space.

Last week, renewable energy and power supplier Bloom Energy (BE) announced that Brookfield will invest up to $5 billion to deploy its fuel cells at AI data centers. That follows a Bloom Energy pact from July with tech giant Oracle (ORCL).

Bloom Energy and Brookfield are actively collaborating on the design and delivery of AI factories globally, including a site in Europe that will be announced before the end of the year, the outfits reported.

Trump Executive Orders Fuel Nuclear Energy

Trump in late May signed four executive orders to support the nuclear energy sector and put in place a ""total and complete reform"" of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, or NRC. The executive orders also look to speed up the deployment of new nuclear power reactors in the U.S.

The May 23 executive orders directed the government to cut down on regulations and fast-track licenses for reactors and power plants to shrink a multiyear process to 18 months. The executive orders from the Trump White House also create a regulatory framework for the departments of Energy and Defense to build nuclear reactors on federal land.

Trump's 'Consequential' Shift In Energy Policy Fuels Upgrades For These Stocks

The Trump White House defines AI as a national security objective and stipulates that the Departments of Energy and Defense work with the private sector to accelerate deployments of small modular reactors, or SMRs, to power AI.

The Trump executive orders also target increased U.S. uranium mining and look to expand domestic uranium enrichment capacity.

Nuclear: Cameco Stock

Cameco stock surged around 20% to 103.70 at Tuesday's stock market open. The stock broke out in mid-October above an 89.13 buy point from an ascending base, according to MarketSurge charts.

Shares then undercut that buy point by more than 8%, triggering the automatic stop-loss sell rule. Shares were in a buy range Monday on a rebound from a test of 10-week support. That buy zone extends to 89.73.

Brookfield Asset Management stock advanced more than 2% early Tuesday.

Brookfield Renewable Partners (BEP) surged 8% and Brookfield Renewable (BEPC) soared 7.9%.

Cameco stock entered Tuesday's stock market up nearly 70% in 2025. The top uranium refiner reports third-quarter earnings before the market opens on Nov. 5.

Cameco's agreement with the U.S. government comes just a day after NextEra Energy (NEE) announced a 25-year nuclear power purchasing deal with Alphabet (GOOGL)-owned Google.

Under the NextEra-Google deal, the Duane Arnold Energy Center, Iowa's only nuclear facility, will restart, with a target of being fully operational by early 2029. At that point, Google will purchase energy from the plant to help ""power Google's growing cloud and AI infrastructure in Iowa.""

NextEra stock fell about 2% Tuesday. The stock gained 1.9% to 86.03 on Monday.

Meanwhile, investors await a slew of nuclear-related earnings reports in the coming days. S&P 500 nuclear giants Constellation Energy (CEG) and Vistra (VST) report on Nov. 7 and Nov. 6, respectively.

Earnings for BWX Technologies (BWXT), the U.S. Navy's main nuclear reactor supplier, are due Nov. 3.

But Ryan O’Gorman’s not worried about a blackout in his suburban Detroit home because his Ford F-150 Lightning electric pickup truck is plugged in, automatically providing the juice.

In between blackouts, O’Gorman’s F-150 Lightning is also helping him save around $40 a month on his power bill.

It’s all possible through Ford Motor Company’s Home Power Management system, which O’Gorman, Ford senior manager, energy services business strategy & delivery, demonstrated for reporters in his driveway last week.

O’Gorman’s truck was plugged into a Ford Charging Station Pro mounted on the side of his garage. That unit is connected by underground cable to an inverter mounted on the side of the house.

The inverter takes the DC power out of the battery and converts it to AC power.

“So in an outage, when the power goes out, there's something called a mid, it's micro grid interface device, transfer switch, disconnects you from the grid, seeks powers out, and then it tells the truck,” explained O’Gorman. “Once everything's good, it sends power into the house.”

With average consumption the set-up can power a home for about three days, according to O’Gorman.

In addition to providing an emergency generator of sorts, the system is designed to reduce a homeowner’s overall electric bill by substituting the truck’s stored power for the electricity the home would normally pull from the grid during peak usage, and cost, times.

Many utilities around the country charge more for power during those peak hours. Ford estimates regular use of the system can save customers about $500 a year on their electric bills.

For instance, if peak electric usage in an area is in the early evening, Ford Home Power Management can be programmed to pull power from the F-150 Lightning instead of the grid.

The electric trucks can then be recharged overnight when electric rates are cheaper, storing power for the next day’s uses.

That leads to a third advantage Ford is touting—smart charging rewards, where a user is paid not to use electricity from the grid at a certain time.

“It's the idea that if a vehicle is charging, the utility will send signals out to say, please don't charge right now, or maybe tomorrow, at five o'clock, we anticipate a heat wave, an air conditioner load being really high, please defer your charging,” said O’Gorman. “Then you're basically a resource to the grid, and then they compensate you for being that resource.”

Indeed, the concept includes using electricity solely from the truck’s battery, taking an entire home off the grid for a period of time, easing the load for the utility.

Called the Ford Energy Rewards program, the automaker is working with DTE Energy, Eversource Energy, SMUD, TXU Energy, Xcel Energy and “many others.”

Ford and DTE Energy in Michigan, are running a pilot program with 15 Ford employees aimed at rewarding them for returning power to the grid.

Participants are compensated for sharing a portion of their F-150 Lightning’s battery capacity with the utility. DTE Energy’s power grid will send notifications to ChargeScape, the Ford-backed vehicle-to-grid integration platform, to schedule and optimize the use of Ford employees’ EV batteries to power their homes.

Currently, Ford employees and customers are using the Ford Home Power Management in nine states in conjunction with participating utilities, but the company is looking to expand its availability, according to O’Gorman.

So-called vehicle-to-home, or V2H technology is not exclusive at all to Ford.

It’s currently available on vehicles that include the Nissan Leaf, Kia EV9, Tesla Cybertruck and at least eight EVs produced by General Motors Co. under the Chevrolet, GMC and Cadillac brands.

The Tesla Powerwall is a free standing unit that stores electricity generated the grid or solar and can be used to power devices in a home, as a generator during outages or when a homeowner wants to go off the grid.

While asserting the Ford Home Power Management system could be used with “theoretically any vehicle with a battery,” the automaker decided to start with only the F-150 Lightning.

“It was an opportunity because we had the Ford Charge Station Pro we're introducing, which was kind of matched with this truck and the larger battery, and then we were able to make it bi-directional at the same time,” he explained.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/68ffc3a21c7e251754b20d6e/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-10-28 12:06:18.094570

Rice and other panelists including Chris James, founder and chief investment officer of investment firm Engine No. 1 LP, and Cynthia Hansen, head of gas transmission and midstream at Enbridge Inc., see developing more infrastructure, particularly natural gas, as the way to bring down utility bills as well as meet demand from data centers supporting artificial intelligence.

States such as Pennsylvania, Ohio, Louisiana and Texas are well positioned to add more gas infrastructure as interest from data center developers increases because of abundant supply and friendly regulatory environment, Hansen said. “It’s your supply as well as your permitting and your ability to build out,” Hansen added.

In the short term, low prices stand to squeeze some gas producers as they try to meet demand growth from liquefied natural gas exports and AI power loads and build more infrastructure.

“In the US, we believe the marginal producer is going to need around $3.50 gas price to break even,” Rice said. To generate a 10% return on enterprise value, “marginal cost of supply is going to need gas between $4 to $5 to justify the activity that’s coming out here,” Rice added.

Carolina’s campus is filled with endless plants, bushes and trees kept beautiful by Carolina’s busiest pollinators — bees.

“For me, bees remind me of the wonder that it is to be alive, which is a big statement to make,” said Ben Diasio, junior and vice president of the Carolina Beekeeping Club. “It really helps me connect with my sort of sense of wonder and nature.”

The Carolina Beekeeping Club is a student-led organization hoping to inspire students through the world of honeybees. Students learn how to protect the environment, focus on sustainability and see how pollinators support plants. Since 2016, the club’s goal has been to educate the Carolina community about beekeeping.

“Our beekeeping club beehives are important to have on our campus as I think it makes UNC one of the most beautiful campuses in the country,” said Nathan Halsey, junior and president of the club. “Bees help pollinate different trees and flowers around campus, helping with biodiversity. They pollinate areas of campus all the way from the Dean Dome to Carolina North to Carrboro. Bees have a huge impact, even though you might not see them daily.”

Any undergraduate or graduate students can join the club and work at the beehives, located at Battle Grove.

“Battle Grove is nice because it’s a place where the University has a long-dedicated effort around sustainability, and it’s now become a collective area where lots of different things are going on. It’s designated as a bird habitat, and now it has wildly successful beehives from the beekeeping club,” said Michael Piehler, director of the Institute for the Environment and Carolina Beekeeping Club faculty adviser. “It really stands out as a sustainability landmark for the University.”

Students in the club take care of the inner hive, check on the queen bee to make sure she’s healthy and laying eggs, ensure pests and pathogens aren’t affecting the bees and provide a healthy environment to pollinate flowers on campus.

“Taking care of bees involves sort of being a detective. You need to see what the state of the bees is currently,” said Diasio. “Do they need more food? Are they low on nectar? Should you feed them sugar water? It’s like being a landlord and their doctor rolled into one.”

Students also lead or attend hive tours, paint pollinator boxes around campus with bee facts, put plants around campus for honeybees to pollinate, harvest honey and protect and inspire people about honeybees and other pollinators.

“Any club at Carolina is important because it gives students a perspective on the world they’re entering after getting their education. The Carolina Beekeeping Club is a great example of that — they’re taking a challenge that sits within a broader suite of opportunities around sustainability, and they’re making it their own,” said Piehler.

This past summer, the club harvested over 200 pounds of honey — 500 jars — in their first ever harvest for the club. The club plans to sell the jars to buy food for the Carolina Cupboard pantry, a student-run food pantry on campus, as part of the new “Honey for Hunger” initiative focusing on combatting food insecurity.

Bees pollinate one-third of all the food people eat. “Having them is great for the environment and is a great example of how the environment brings value to people,” said Piehler.

“Honeybees have taught me about the meaning of life. They rely on each other; one bee can’t survive by themselves in a beehive. It’s taught me that collective action community and everybody pitching in really can make a difference in the world,” said Halsey.",https://www.unc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/BeekeepingThumb_Hero.png,N,,2025-10-28 11:00:46.999244

Partnership will accelerate nuclear power and artificial intelligence deployment in America

All values are USD

Tokyo & Cranberry, PA, October 28, 2025 – Westinghouse Electric Company (“Westinghouse”), Cameco Corporation (“Cameco”) and Brookfield Asset Management (“Brookfield”) today announced that the United States Government (“U.S. Government”) has entered into a strategic partnership to accelerate the deployment of nuclear power, in accordance with the President’s May 23, 2025 Executive Orders.

At the center of the new strategic partnership, at least $80 billion of new reactors will be constructed across the United States using Westinghouse nuclear reactor technology. These new reactors will reinvigorate the nuclear power industrial base.

As a result of this historic agreement, nuclear energy deployment will be a central pillar of America’s program to maintain global leadership in nuclear power development and Artificial Intelligence (“AI”).

Howard Lutnick, Secretary for the United States Department of Commerce, said:

“Our administration is focussed on ensuring the rapid development, deployment, and use of advanced nuclear technologies. This historic partnership supports our national security objectives and enhances our critical infrastructure. Together with Westinghouse we will unleash American energy. This partnership embodies the bold vision of President Trump – to rebuild our energy sovereignty, create high-paying jobs, and drive America to the forefront of the nuclear renaissance.”

Chris Wright, Secretary for the United States Department of Energy, said:

“This historic partnership with America’s leading nuclear company will help unleash President Trump’s grand vision to fully energize America and win the global AI race. President Trump promised a renaissance of nuclear power, and now he is delivering.”

Connor Teskey, President of Brookfield Asset Management, said:

“This partnership with the U.S. Government will help unlock the potential that Westinghouse and nuclear energy can play to accelerate the growth of artificial intelligence in the United States, while meeting growing electricity demand and energy security needs at scale. Brookfield has more than half a trillion dollars invested in the critical infrastructure that underpins the U.S. economy, and we expect to double that investment in the next decade as we deliver on building the infrastructure backbone of artificial intelligence.”

Tim Gitzel, CEO of Cameco, said:

“Our highly successful partnership with Brookfield as owners of Westinghouse will be further strengthened through this collaboration with the U.S. Government. We expect this new partnership to support the global growth opportunities for both Westinghouse’s and Cameco’s nuclear products, services and technologies, adding significant long-term value for our stakeholders and enhancing energy, national and climate security around the world. As a strategic partner, Cameco is a secure and reliable western-based supplier of the uranium fuel needed to support the civilian deployment and long-term reliable operation of Westinghouse’s technology in the U.S. and globally.”

A new partnership for growth

The partnership will facilitate the growth and future of the American nuclear power industry and the supporting supply chain. Each two-unit Westinghouse AP1000 project creates or sustains 45,000 manufacturing and engineering jobs in 43 states, and a national deployment will create more than 100,000 construction jobs. The program will cement the United States as one of the world’s nuclear energy powerhouses and increase exports of Westinghouse’s nuclear power generation technology globally.

As part of the partnership, at least $80 billion of nuclear reactors will be constructed using Westinghouse technology. Once constructed, the reactors will generate reliable and secure power, including for significant data center and compute capacity that will drive America’s growth in AI.

The partnership contains profit sharing mechanisms that provide for all parties, including the American people, once certain thresholds are met, to participate in the long-term financial and strategic value that will be created within Westinghouse by the growth of nuclear energy and advancement of investment into AI capabilities in the United States.

Westinghouse Overview

Westinghouse is a recognized global leader in nuclear energy with its technology serving as the basis for more than half the world’s operating nuclear power fleet. The company’s industry-leading intellectual property is rooted in American engineering, pioneering the construction of nuclear energy plants in the United States in the 1950s and industrializing its technology worldwide.

The AP1000 reactor is the most advanced reactor commercially available, with fully passive safety systems, modular construction design and the smallest footprint per MWe on the market. There are six AP1000 reactors currently setting operational performance and availability records worldwide with 14 additional reactors under construction and five more under contract. The AP1000 technology has been selected for nuclear energy programs in Poland, Ukraine and Bulgaria.

Brookfield and Cameco formed a strategic partnership to acquire Westinghouse in October 2022. The partnership brought together Cameco’s expertise in the nuclear industry and nuclear fuel supply chain with Brookfield’s recognized position as one of the world’s largest investors in energy generation technologies. Brookfield initially acquired Westinghouse in 2018 and performed a successful turnaround to reposition the company to benefit from the resurgence in nuclear investment.

Lede

The shuttered Duane Arnold nuclear facility is poised to come back to life. In a landmark collaboration announced on Monday, Google, via its parent company Alphabet, entered into a long-term agreement with NextEra Energy to resume operations of the Duane Arnold Energy Center by early 2029. The move is a concrete example of major technology firms turning to nuclear energy to meet the unrelenting demand of data centres, cloud infrastructure and artificial intelligence processing.

Restarting an idled asset

The Duane Arnold plant, Iowa’s only nuclear power station, went offline in August 2020 after more than 45 years of operation and storm-damaged cooling towers. Under the deal, NextEra will lead the plant’s recommissioning and Google has committed to buy its output under a 25-year contract. The power supply agreement underscores the shift from intermittent renewables to dispatchable zero-emission baseload as corporate clients lock in reliability.

Regulatory progress is already underway. In August 2025, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) approved a waiver that enables NextEra to consolidate interconnection rights via the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) framework — a critical step to restarting the plant and preserving its network access. Meanwhile, NextEra has submitted licence change requests to the NRC, which will supervise structural and operational upgrades necessary for safe return to service.

Governance and investment angles

For the C-suite, this transaction raises key governance questions. How will corporate offtake and energy-asset ownership evolve when technology firms contract directly with nuclear plants? Google’s role is not merely as a customer — it is shaping the economics of a nuclear restart. As Ruth Porat, Google’s Chief Investment Officer, put it: “This partnership serves as a model for the investments needed across the country to build energy capacity and deliver reliable, clean power.”

From a financing perspective, the estimated capital cost for the plant’s revival is north of USD 1.6 billion. The locked-in PPA gives NextEra the revenue certainty needed to proceed with refurbishment, upgrade of cooling systems, administrative infrastructure and plant systems. Analysts say this model could accelerate other restarts, especially where decommissioned assets sit on robust interconnection points.

ESG and climate implications

On the ESG front, nuclear offers distinct advantages: high capacity-factor, low lifecycle emissions, and grid-firm power. The Duane Arnold restart illustrates how nuclear can be re-integrated into clean-energy portfolios that traditionally have leaned heavily on wind and solar. Yet it also raises questions around decommissioning risk, spent-fuel management and community approval. The NRC’s oversight will remain central. For investors focused on climate goals and transition risk, the deal signals that nuclear is shifting from a niche “option” to a foundational element of corporate decarbonisation strategy.

Take-aways for C-suite and investors

Executives and sustainability leads should draw three take-aways. First: offtake agreements for baseload nuclear are emerging as viable decarbonisation tools for firms with large, stable load-profiles. Second: regulatory waivers and grid-access strategies are now pivotal levers in nuclear-restart economics. Third: this may signal a nascent asset-class shift — decommissioned plants becoming re-commissioned, with new ownership or financing structures reflecting a corporate-tech demand lens.

Global relevance

Although this project is specific to the U.S. Midwest, its implications are global. Countries debating nuclear policy can see this as a commercial precedent for nuclear-asset repurposing in a low-carbon world. For global investors, the Duane Arnold deal showcases nascent models linking corporate clean-energy demand with legacy thermal infrastructure revival. In a regionally and globally connected grid world, this may reshape how governments, utilities and companies calculate nuclear risk, reward and role in the energy transition.",https://esgnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Google-Backs-NextEra-in-Reviving-Iowa-Nuclear-Plant-to-Supply-600-MW-of-Clean-Powe.png,N,,2025-10-28 13:12:34.874179

Taylor",,,,,https://washingtonstatestandard.com/briefs/climate-dollars-eyed-for-wa-wildfire-funding/,"“Climate Commitment Act dollars are going to be on the table,” said state Rep. Larry Springer, D-Kirkland, who is deputy House majority leader.
“Although the general fund has a large shortfall, the Climate Commitment Act funding has some capacity,” Upthegrove said.
Under the Climate Commitment Act, businesses that produce large amounts of air pollution must buy allowances at state-run auctions to compensate for their emissions.
He makes a case that there’s a clear connection between the Climate Commitment Act and wildfires.
“So there’s the nexus with the Climate Commitment Act that I hope my colleagues will see.”","Washington’s lands commissioner, Dave Upthegrove, is on a mission to secure $60 million of additional wildfire funding in next year’s legislative session, despite a tightening budget outlook.

On Monday, he and a leading Democratic House lawmaker indicated that they want to tap revenue from the state’s cap-and-trade program for at least some of that money. The maneuver would mean turning to a steady-flowing stream of cash at a time when the state’s operating budget is squeezed.

“Climate Commitment Act dollars are going to be on the table,” said state Rep. Larry Springer, D-Kirkland, who is deputy House majority leader.

Lawmakers this year already started dedicating some of the climate dollars to the wildfire programs in question.

At issue is funding provided under a 2021 law known as House Bill 1168, which passed with broad bipartisan support. With that legislation, lawmakers committed to direct $500 million over eight years to wildfire programs. Springer was a lead sponsor.

The HB 1168 funding supports three general areas: initial attacks on wildfires to keep them from growing into huge blazes; forest health measures, like prescribed burns and thinning; and community resilience initiatives focused on making buildings and property less fire-prone.

Legislators largely kept up the funding, with $115 million in the 2023-25 budget and $130 million in the 2021-23 cycle. This year, confronted with a budget deficit, they delivered just $60 million.

The $60 million Upthegrove is now angling for would bring funding in the current two-year budget up to $120 million, on par with the 2021 framework.

But the budget pressures have not subsided, with revenue trailing expectations and lawmakers and the governor preparing for another session rife with difficult budget talks.

It’s against this backdrop that Upthegrove and Springer say that they’ll press for the Climate Commitment Act dollars.

“Although the general fund has a large shortfall, the Climate Commitment Act funding has some capacity,” Upthegrove said.

And spending on proactive wildfire programs, he said, can save money in the long run.

“If we can prevent or reduce the size of one or two large fires, this will more than pay for itself,” Upthegrove added.

Under the Climate Commitment Act, businesses that produce large amounts of air pollution must buy allowances at state-run auctions to compensate for their emissions. The auctions have raised more than $3 billion since they began in early 2023.

Money the law generates is restricted to certain kinds of spending, related to reducing air pollution and environmental projects. There’s a special emphasis under the law on improving air quality and health outcomes in disadvantaged parts of the state.

Reducing wildfire risk and improving forest health are among the eligible uses for the funding.

Before this year, no funding for the HB 1168 fire programs came from the Climate Commitment Act. But in the current budget, $40 million of the $60 million in wildfire spending did.

Springer said it’s too early to say how much of the $60 million he and Upthegrove are now pushing for could come from the climate program.

“That’s going to be through negotiations,” he said.

He makes a case that there’s a clear connection between the Climate Commitment Act and wildfires.

“In terms of the carbon that’s thrown into the air by a wildfire is astronomical,” Springer said. “So there’s the nexus with the Climate Commitment Act that I hope my colleagues will see.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/wildfire-smoke-seattle-2020-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2025-10-28 13:11:12.311656

But those dreams fell short amid a dry summer and shaky economy. North Carolina State University Professor and Extension Specialist Nick Piggott shared his thoughts on how farmers can make the most of a less-than-bumper corn crop, and what areas may assist them in weathering this metaphorical and literal storm. Piggott talked about financial strategies, including sales and markets and how basis plays a part. He also touched on the pros and cons of storage.

How can North Carolina farmers navigate this year’s record U.S. corn crop?

Scale sales into strength—sell small slices on futures or basis rallies (or both). Make the first sale cover bills, then stair-step price targets higher to lift your average; with yield still uncertain and reports lagging, any futures bounce or basis pop in North Carolina from lower yields or transportation issues on imports can add value.

Will basis and the local livestock sector help?

Yes—local feed demand lifts basis in North Carolina’s corn-deficit market. It’s a buffer, not a bailout—smooth rail from the Midwest can cap the premium—and timing matters: basis typically improves after harvest, especially if yields disappoint locally or in the Midwest, making local bushels more valuable.

Is storage the answer?

Robinson and Piggott (2025) demonstrate that returns to storing corn in North Carolina typically originate from the futures carry (the spread between harvest futures and deferred futures contracts) compared to the basis carry (the spread between harvest basis and deferred basis). With record corn production in the Midwest, the future spreads are currently thin: from the 2019/2020 through 2024/2025 marketing years the March and May corn contracts averaged about 31 and 54 cents above the preceding December (harvest) contract, but on Oct. 10, the March 2026 and May 2026 corn contracts were only about 16 and 25 cents above Dec. 2025—roughly half as large.

The key takeaway: storage is likely to pay this year only if significant transportation problems tighten local supplies and lift cash bids, creating significantly higher basis carries. North Carolina still needs to import around 130–150 million bushels, and freight-driven basis premiums are unpredictable; therefore, relying on storage to pay this year is still possible, but is made less probable given the current futures carry has been clipped by expected record Midwest production.

Is forward contracting the answer?

With futures and basis both weaker currently, forward contracting right now isn’t the answer (don’t lock two weak legs)—make a small sale to cover bills, then wait to fix at least one on strength (ideally both). Use puts or minimum-price contracts for downside protection, and only forward contract deferred bushels where carry minus all storage costs is clearly positive; a hedge to arrive fits if you expect basis to improve later.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltdd43779342bd9107/blt203bec17e0a6c2ad/68f7d8c52151e742f579ad4b/GettyImages-1282488584_(2).jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-10-28 14:20:42.687091

Officials said the federal government is turning back to coal and other fossil fuels at a time when pollution from those fuels is worsening climate change.
Further water reductions would harm the region’s ability to produce food and would bring climate change home to all Arizonans, she said.

The group used the Colorado River in Yuma as a backdrop for their message, which they said is made clearer by the shrinking flows of the western lifeline.

Officials said the federal government is turning back to coal and other fossil fuels at a time when pollution from those fuels is worsening climate change.

YUMA — Southern Arizona politicians joined representatives of the Sierra Club by the banks of the Colorado River on Oct. 27 to call on Washington to protect the waterway by taking action against climate change.

The officials, including Democratic U.S. Rep.-elect Adelita Grijalva, were demanding an end to what they called major rollbacks in climate protections, most prominently the Trump administration’s plan to overturn the endangerment finding that enables the Environmental Protection Agency to regulate greenhouse gas emissions.

Grijalva and others connected that action and the revocation of clean energy incentives with the prospect of drought and drying reservoirs that could keep water from flowing to Yuma in the future.

“We cannot let this lifeline run dry,” Grijalva said.

The congresswoman-elect has yet to be sworn in during the ongoing government shutdown — a point one person in the handful of supporters attending the event emphasized with the placard that read, “Swear her in.”

Without the Colorado, 'there is no Arizona'

City Councilmember Lizeth Sevin, from the border town of San Luis, noted that the river already is fully diverted before it passes her community. Further water reductions would harm the region’s ability to produce food and would bring climate change home to all Arizonans, she said.

“Without the Colorado River, there is no Arizona, there is no Nevada, there is no Southern California,” she said, “and of course there is no San Luis.”

Sierra Club Grand Canyon Chapter Director Sandy Bahr organized the event at Yuma’s riverside Gateway Park to draw attention to a facet of climate change that already has harmed Arizona and is likely to sting more next year when the federal government is expected to adopt new water-sharing guidelines for the seven states that use the river.

Still, she noted, President Donald Trump attempted to force Arizona Public Service to reopen the closed Cholla coal-fired power plant until it became apparent that doing so would cost the utility more than $1 billion — and more than the president had directed to prop up coal nationwide.

Not enough water for data centers, lawmaker says

Cary Meister, a Yuma resident who leads the chapter’s Colorado River Task Force, said Lake Powell dropped by 33 feet in the past year to prop up Lake Mead and keep the Southwest from facing deeper cuts than it already has — an option that may not exist if more dry winters deplete the reservoir. Yet the government has cut back on support for renewable energy while seeking to support fossil fuels.

“Right now, Washington is putting all its eggs in the oil and coal basket,” he said.

Democratic State Rep. Mariana Sandoval, whose southern Arizona district includes part of Yuma, said the state also needs to balance the job creation of new data centers with their water demands.

“We don’t have the water for ourselves, let alone data centers,” Sandoval said.

With the Southwest's worsening water outlook, wildfire seasons and heat waves, she said, ""Climate change is no longer a distant threat.""

Asked how Arizonans can change the trajectory on climate policy, Grijalva pointed to next year’s congressional elections.

“We have an opportunity to change the majority in the House,” she said.

Eavor is part of a fast-growing effort to expand geothermal energy projects beyond traditional hot spots like California’s Salton Sea region or Iceland’s lava fields.
Eavor began drilling in Geretsried in July 2023, shortly after winning a $107 million grant from the European Union’s Innovation Fund.
But other next-generation approaches — like the enhanced geothermal systems that Fervo is building in Utah and operating in Nevada — are also scaling up.
In places that ban fracking, like Germany, closed-loop systems can still move forward.","Eavor, an advanced-geothermal startup, says it has significantly reduced drilling times and improved technologies at its nearly online project in Germany — milestones that should help it drive down the costs of harnessing clean energy from the ground.

On Tuesday, the Canadian company released results from two years of drilling activity at its flagship operation in Geretsried, Germany, giving Canary Media an exclusive early look. Eavor said the data validates its initial efforts to deploy novel ​“closed-loop” geothermal systems in hotter and deeper locations than conventional projects can access.

“Much like wind and solar have come down the cost curve, much like unconventional shale [oil and gas] have come down the cost curve, we now have a technical proof-point that we’ve done that in Europe,” Jeanine Vany, a cofounder and executive vice president of corporate affairs at Eavor, said from the Geothermal Rising conference in Reno, Nevada.

Eavor is part of a fast-growing effort to expand geothermal energy projects beyond traditional hot spots like California’s Salton Sea region or Iceland’s lava fields. The company and other firms — including Fervo Energy, Sage Geosystems, and XGS Energy — are adapting tools and techniques from the oil and gas industry to be able to withstand the harsh conditions found deep underground.

The industry wants to produce abundant amounts of clean electricity and heat virtually anywhere in the world, and it could serve as an ideal, around-the-clock pairing to solar and wind power. But geothermal companies are only just starting to put their novel technologies to the test.

Eavor began drilling in Geretsried in July 2023, shortly after winning a $107 million grant from the European Union’s Innovation Fund. For its first ​“loop,” the company drilled two vertical wells reaching nearly 2.8 miles below the surface, then created a dozen horizontal wells — like tines of a fork — that each stretch 1.8 miles long. Once in place, the wells are connected underground and sealed off so that they operate like radiators: As water circulates within the system, it collects heat from the rocks and brings it to the surface.

In its new paper, Eavor said it encountered significant challenges in drilling its first eight of twelve lateral wells, which took over 100 days to complete — a major expense in an industry where drilling rigs can cost about $100,000 a day to run. But the company said it improved its techniques and adapted its equipment in ways that reduced the drilling time for the remaining four wells by 50%.

For example, Eavor said it successfully deployed an insulated drill pipe technology, which can actively cool drilling tools even as they encounter increasingly hotter conditions underground and helps to increase drilling speed. The adjustments also enabled Eavor to triple the length of time its drill bit could run before wearing out, further reducing downtime during the operation.

On top of cutting drilling time and costs, these improvements should also pave a path to boosting Eavor’s thermal-energy output per loop by about 35%, Vany said.

The Germany project will be the first commercial system of its kind when it starts producing power later this year. But other next-generation approaches — like the enhanced geothermal systems that Fervo is building in Utah and operating in Nevada — are also scaling up.

Enhanced geothermal involves fracturing rocks and pumping down liquids to create artificial reservoirs. The hot rocks directly heat the liquids, which return to the surface to make steam. This approach is relatively more efficient at extracting heat from the ground, but it can also raise the risk of inducing earthquakes or affecting groundwater — though experts say that’s unlikely to happen in well-managed projects. In places that ban fracking, like Germany, closed-loop systems can still move forward.

But the closed-loop design has trade-offs of its own, said Jeff Tester, a professor of sustainable energy systems at Cornell University and the principal scientist for Cornell’s Earth Source Heat project. Namely, the pipes can limit the transfer of heat from the underground rocks to the fluids inside the pipe, which in turn limits how much energy a system can produce.

“While companies developing closed-loop systems can make them work, the main challenge they face is for fluid temperatures and flow rates to be high enough to pay off economically,” Tester said. ​“You can get energy out of the ground; it’s just, how much can you sustainably and affordably produce from a single closed-loop well connection?”

Vany said that Eavor’s modeling shows its technology is already in line with the ​“levelized cost of heat” in Europe, which estimates the average cost of providing a unit of heat over the lifetime of the project. That figure can fluctuate between $50 and $100 per megawatt-hour thermal in the region’s volatile energy market, she said.

“After we’ve drilled those first four loops, we will be at the bottom of the learning curve,” Vany added. ​“And that’s the purpose of the Geretsried project.”",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/Geretsried-drone.jpeg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=537b20fb831952907286a3a63dce8522,N,,2025-10-28 13:10:15.729359

The award positioned California at the center of the nation’s ambitions for clean hydrogen — until the Trump administration abruptly withdrew funding Oct. 1.
Nevertheless, Los Angeles is pressing ahead with Scattergood — one of several projects that were part of the original statewide hydrogen push.","The Scattergood Generating Station in Los Angeles is an oceanfront natural-gas-burning relic that sits on the uncertain brink of a clean-energy showdown.

On Tuesday, the Los Angeles Board of Water and Power Commissioners will decide whether to advance a plan to shift the plant to futuristic hydrogen-ready turbines. The $800-million-plus retrofit is an anchor in California’s effort to boost hydrogen, a potentially clean fuel that for now remains costly, water-intensive and rarely produced without oil and gas.

But California’s high hopes for hydrogen — and the state’s investments in it as a potential economic driver in the era of clean energy — are at a crossroads.

Earlier this month, the Trump administration canceled $1.2 billion in federal funding for California’s hydrogen hub, a public-private partnership to build a clean hydrogen economy and support projects like Scattergood. The move followed a decision earlier this summer to scale back federal tax credits nationally for hydrogen.

California says it’s pressing ahead with hydrogen projects including Scattergood, with or without federal support.

“The state remains committed to developing a renewable hydrogen ecosystem,” said Willie Rudman, a spokesman for the Governor’s Office of Business and Economic Development, or GO-Biz, which led the creation of the hydrogen partnership. Clean hydrogen, Rudman added, “holds incredible potential as California continues its transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy.”

Critics say that optimism ignores real costs and trade-offs.

A bold investment, an uncertain climate

California politicians have chased hydrogen for decades, seeking environmental and economic benefits. In 2004, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger famously rolled out a hydrogen-powered Hummer and ordered a “Hydrogen Highway” of fueling stations.

The state’s most recent bid – an ambitious hydrogen hub – has been its boldest investment yet.

In 2022, Gov. Gavin Newsom launched the Alliance for Renewable Clean Hydrogen Energy Systems, or ARCHES — a partnership led by GO-Biz, the University of California, and the State Building and Construction Trades Council. It now counts more than four hundred public- and private-sector partners, including Chevron and other energy companies.

Most hydrogen today comes from natural gas — a carbon-intensive process that undercuts its climate appeal. Over time, ARCHES hopes to help industry swap that process for “green” hydrogen made by splitting water with renewable power, an expensive and elusive process.

Newsom has embraced hydrogen as both climate and economic policy.

“Scaling this in California isn’t just about addressing the climate crisis — it’s also about creating hundreds of thousands of jobs,” Newsom wrote in August 2023. He directed his administration to develop an “all-of-government Hydrogen Market Development Strategy,” similar to what California had done for electric cars.

ARCHES won up to $1.2 billion in federal funding from the Department of Energy as part of a $12.6 billion total statewide hydrogen hub. The award positioned California at the center of the nation’s ambitions for clean hydrogen — until the Trump administration abruptly withdrew funding Oct. 1.

Newsom blasted the move as political and “common sense be damned.” While California lost its funding, several hydrogen hubs in Republican-led states kept theirs. California has appealed the decision.

State Sen. Anna Caballero, a Democrat from Merced who authored a law speeding approval of hydrogen projects last year, said she expects talks next session on using cap-and-trade funds to keep the hydrogen hub alive. Private and international investors, she added, remain interested in California’s market.

“People in my district are asking for good jobs as we make this transition — and they’re looking for clean air — and hydrogen has the capacity to do all of the above,” Caballero said. “We have the opportunity, and I’d like to see us explore it.”

Not everyone was disappointed by the loss of the California funding. Some environmental groups, concerned about encouraging fossil fuels and the potential for explosions, welcomed the federal cancellation. Nevertheless, Los Angeles is pressing ahead with Scattergood — one of several projects that were part of the original statewide hydrogen push.

Why LA is betting on hydrogen

Until a few weeks ago, ARCHES, the state’s hydrogen hub, was expected to contribute at least $100 million to the Scattergood retrofit.

“Our understanding is that the federal dollars are not coming in,” said Jason Rondou, assistant general manager of power planning and operations for the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. “We don’t know yet if there will be another mechanism to make up that $100 million.”

Still, the largest municipal utility in the country is seeking approval from its board for the Scattergood conversion, calling it a step toward the city’s goal of fossil-free power by 2035 and the state’s similar goal, with a deadline a decade later.

Utility officials say the Scattergood upgrade is necessary because its aging gas turbines are inefficient, dirty and cooled with seawater — a process now banned under state policy because of its impact on marine life. The plan is to replace the old turbines with a new combined-cycle unit designed to burn a blend of hydrogen and natural gas.

The goal is to make Scattergood more of a “peaker” plant — one that can fire up and cycle down to match demand surges, rather than running around the clock. But environmentalists are concerned about a project that runs on “green” hydrogen when it isn’t readily available at scale. The retrofit would keep the plant running on natural gas, with LADWP reserving the option to blend in as much as 30% hydrogen if the fuel becomes available and affordable.

“You’re spending a lot of money on a technology that doesn’t currently exist,” said Julia Dowell, a Long Beach-based organizer with the Sierra Club, who’s led opposition to the Scattergood plan. “We don’t really know when it will come to fruition — if at all.”

For now, this is a natural gas plant, said Dan Esposito, a hydrogen expert with the clean energy think tank Energy Innovation. “In a place with high local air pollution, in a place that has these high clean energy goals … should we be building a new gas plant if there are other clean technologies that we can invest in that we have more certainty will deliver on those clean energy targets? It’s a very tough question.”

In a recent analysis, the city’s ratepayer advocate said the financial setback “doesn’t close the door on clean hydrogen” but nevertheless raises questions about who ultimately pays for the project — and how the utility will balance its clean-energy goals with affordability.

The risks ahead

LA’s water and power commissioners are likely to approve Scattergood’s modernization on Tuesday. The vote won’t start construction, but it will clear the way for the city’s department of water and power to seek builders and finalize designs.

The decision also points up a tough question for California’s hydrogen strategy: without federal support, are public agencies investing scarce climate dollars in the right places?

Scattergood’s environmental review drew nearly 100 comments from residents, neighboring cities and advocacy groups.

The city of El Segundo warned that emissions and construction traffic could spill across its borders. Business groups backed the plan as a source of jobs and grid reliability. Meanwhile environmental groups warned of harms both locally and beyond.

Building even one major hydrogen project like Scattergood means committing to an entire network of pipelines, storage and supply.

“An investment in hydrogen comes with an opportunity cost,” said Alex Jasset, director of energy justice at Physicians for Social Responsibility Los Angeles, who opposes the project. “We’re dumping a lot of our very limited resources for addressing the climate crisis into an inefficient, expensive option when we could be instead investing in cheaper, more scalable, more immediate benefits.”

Jasset said that the infrastructure for hydrogen projects will mostly be paid for by Californians – through taxes, utility bills, or state business fees. And if those projects fall short, they risk prolonging fossil-fuel infrastructure in neighborhoods already burdened by pollution.

Esposito, the analyst at Energy Innovation, says the Trump Administration’s cancellation of the hydrogen hub award, and the loss of federal credits, might offer a silver lining.

“There was so much money for hydrogen, and so much excitement, that we were frankly at risk of making a lot of bad decisions,” Esposito said. “There were all these proposals that were coming out that were not on solid financial ground — and needed these big subsidies — and then a lot of this money dried up overnight.”

As Los Angeles considers its major project, Esposito added, the state’s hydrogen boosters are getting something essential: a reality check. The challenge now is whether that clarity can guide smarter investments — and a more sustainable path forward.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/031722-Scattergood-Power-Plant-GETTY-CM.jpg?fit=2000%2C1334&ssl=1,N,,2025-10-28 08:18:59.531134

More EVs means more electricity demand, which could require costly infrastructure upgrades or limit when drivers can charge if demand is too high.

But one long-talked about promise of EVs is that they could actually make our electricity grid more resilient. Through bidirectional charging, EVs could essentially act as batteries parked outside your home, powering houses so that they don’t need to rely on outside electricity.

They could also even send energy back to the grid.

Through its Home Power Management program, F-150 Lightning owners can use their trucks to power their homes when electricity prices from the grid are high, easing energy burdens and saving people money on their monthly bills.

It also gives customers the ability to send energy from the trucks back to the grid, in some instances earning them money from their electricity company for doing so.

“We see an opportunity here where our vehicles can be part of the solution rather than compounding the problem,” Dave McCreadie, director of Ford’s EV-Grid Integration Strategy and Business Development, said during a recent press briefing on the program.

The rollout is currently limited, but Ford expects to expand a Home Power Management pilot in 2026.

At a time when EV sales are lagging and EV tax credits have expired—and as homeowners across the country are seeing their energy bills increase—Ford hopes potential customers see these features as another benefit to owning an EV.

A personal power plant to lower energy bills

Backup power has been a feature in the F-150 Lightning since its release in 2022.

After major hurricanes like Helene in North Carolina and Beryl in Texas, F-150 Lightning owners used their trucks as generators, allowing them to keep the lights on and the refrigerator running when the power went out. A fully charged F-150 Lightning can power a home for three days; if that power is rationed, it can last up to 10 days.

Backup power only works when the grid goes down. Home Power Management, however, allows EV owners to use their trucks to power their homes even when the grid is up and running.

The idea is that customers can charge their EVs overnight during offpeak hours, when electricity rates are low. Then, when demand peaks and rates go up, they can use their EV to power their homes.

That both offsets a homeowner’s electricity bills and frees up power from the grid to go elsewhere. The home in question is now essentially “invisible” to the grid, the automaker explains.

In June 2024, Ford partnered with Baltimore Gas & Electric (BGE) and Sunrun, a home solar and battery company, to launch the country’s first vehicle-to-home pilot program, allowing EV owners to use their vehicles to power their homes anytime, not just during an outage.

Brian Foreman, an F-150 Lightning owner in Highland, Maryland, was the first customer to do so, essentially turning his EV into his own personal power plant.

Ford didn’t share exactly how much Foreman saved on his electricity bills, but says that customers can save an average of $42 per month, or $500 per year, by using the vehicle-to-home capability.

“When most people would be concerned, ‘I’ve got an electric vehicle, my electricity bill is going to go up,’ well now you have this offset. Your vehicle is actually working for you in your driveway while it’s parked,” said Ryan O’Gorman, senior manager of energy services business strategy and delivery at Ford.

Sending energy to the grid—and making money

In the summer of 2025, Foreman joined two other BGE customers for another pilot, this time one that allowed customers to use their F-150 Lightnings to send power to the grid.

This turns the EVs into “distributed power plants,” per the utility company, which also paid customers for the energy they shared.

Instead of just saving customers money on their electricity bills, this next step in Ford’s Home Power Management program lets EV owners make money through their EVs. The participants could earn up to $1,000 for the power they provided between July and September.

Using your F-150 Lightning to power your home during peak energy demand or to send power to the grid does require extra equipment: an inverter called the Home Integration System, created by Ford and Sunrun.

That equipment is also needed if you want to use your truck to provide backup power during an outage, so some customers already have it installed. The Home Integration System costs $3,895, and installation can be another $3,000, though those prices vary.

That expense is on top of the price to buy and install a home EV charger. Some Ford customers received a free charger and installation through the automaker’s Ford Power Promise program, but for those that missed out on that opportunity, a level 2 Ford Charge Station Pro costs another $1,310 plus installation, which can vary from $200 to $1,000, depending on any wiring upgrades your home needs.

That means there is an upfront cost to eventually being able to offset your energy bills or make money by providing power through your EV. But Ford says its F-150 Lightning is cost competitive to buying a 10-kilowatt stationary backup generator for your home—plus, it’s a generator you can drive around.

Looking ahead for Ford

Currently, a handful of customers in just nine states are using Ford’s Home Power Management capabilities, including Maryland, Georgia (where Ford did a six-month pilot program with energy provider Southern Company focused on commercial fleets), and Vermont (where energy expert Peter Schneider tested the program with Ford, using it to power his home, and reduce grid strain, during extreme heat there this past summer).

Getting this system set up requires working with utility companies, which have to provide approval and permits for EVs to be interconnected with the grid in these ways.

Automakers also work with utilities to communicate about peak demand, with software that automatically charges an EV at grid-friendly times.

“Ford trying to maintain communications with hundreds and even thousands of electric utilities across the country is an untenable business solution,” McCreadie said. “We found that other automakers were having the same problem.”

Ford worked with BMW and Honda to create ChargeScape, a joint venture that launched in 2024, which basically acts as “connective tissue,” McCreadie explained, to link utilities and automakers, and integrate EVs into the grid.

Though vehicle-to-home and vehicle-to-grid charging is a goal for the EV industry at large, Ford says it’s ahead of the pack with its recent pilot programs.

Ford and Michigan-based DTE Energy have also recently launched a new program piloting the vehicle-to-home capabilities, starting with a group of 15 Ford employees.

Through that pilot, DTE Energy will pay participants for using their EVs to power their homes during times of high electricity demand. But EV owners don’t have to do anything themselves; the system is entirely automated.

DTE Energy will send notifications to ChargeScape to schedule when participants EV’s provide power for their homes. Though it’s only available to Ford employees right now, the automaker says it’s working with DTE to hopefully expand the program to the general public later on in 2026.","https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024/wp-cms-2/2025/10/p-1-91429698-ford-power.jpg",N,,2025-10-28 08:18:32.848542

The program requires the Ford Charge Station, Ford Home Integration System and a participating utility, but it could save some owners up to $500 per year, the carmaker claims. It also allows people to earn money this way.

As Ford expects EV sales to slow in the short term, the program could encourage some homeowners to break up with gasoline.

Blame AI data centers, or an outdated grid, or extreme weather events, or even more electric vehicles on the road. But one thing is clear: Americans' electricity bills are on the rise. And now, Ford has a solution for certain F-150 Lightning owners that's designed to save money on charging, support the grid and do what no gas truck ever could.

Ford today unveiled its Home Power Management program, which allows F-150 Lightning owners with the correct set of equipment to better manage their home charging, power their homes in a smarter way and support the grid when needed. It can store up electricity from when energy rates are cheapest to power an entire house during the more expensive hours.

And using the F-150 Lightning's native bi-directional charging feature, owners in participating utility markets will be able to earn money for charging at more grid-friendly times of the day.

Ford officials said the program is proof of how EVs can reduce stress on electric grids and provide power to homes when it's needed. ""Our customers need solutions to frequent, more frequent grid outages,"" Ford spokesperson Maria Buczkowski said. ""We see an opportunity here where our EVs can be part of the solution, rather than compounding the problem.""

Ford Home Power Management

The F-150 Lightning has always supported bi-directional home power. And like some other EVs, this capability has been used to keep the power on during natural disasters, like Hurricane Beryl in Texas last summer. But this takes things to the next level by allowing them to send stored energy back into the grid; Ford has been running a pilot program since this summer, and now it's set to expand.

It works like this: F-150 Lightning owners with the Ford Charge Station Pro home charger and Sunrun's Home Integration System can take advantage of the fact that electric rates are generally cheaper during the day. It's in the evening and at night when everybody's home, cooking dinner or watching TV and playing video games, that rates go up.

With Home Power Management, the truck can automatically charge up during those cheaper times and then power the house itself during the more expensive times of day—effectively skipping over the priciest times of day for electricity.

Ford officials said they've been piloting this with several utilities, including DTE Energy in Detroit, the Sacramento Municipal Utility District in California, Eversource in New England, TXU Energy in North Texas, and others. Many other pilot programs are in progress with unnamed utilities, they said, as Ford hopes to scale this program across the country quickly. It's been working with all of those providers via its ChargeScape joint venture.

Bi-directional charging and home power, including vehicle-to-grid (V2G) capabilities, are quickly on the rise in the EV space. General Motors recently announced that it will lease out its home power equipment, enabling any GM EV to act as an energy source for an entire house. And Wallbox and Kia are expanding their California pilot programs to power homes and the grid using the EV9. Tesla is also growing its power-sharing operations via the home Powerwall.

The Ford Home Integration System is not complementary, but costs $3,895 for the hardware, plus installation. It is available through Ford's partner, Sunrun. Ford is expected to announce more utility partners over time.

While Ford officials have acknowledged they expect EV sales to decline in the near term with tax credits coming to an end, they are anticipating greater demand over time—especially with the rollout of Ford's upcoming $30,000 EV truck and platform. That too will have bidirectional charging capabilities and work with grids in the same way, presumably at a wider scale when the first trucks go on sale starting in 2027.

""I think that customers are going to want this because it's something that is unique to electric vehicles,"" Ford spokesperson Emma Bergg said. ""And I think the more people who work out that there is an energy independence advantage to electric vehicles, that'll be another reason for people to consider them beyond any tax incentives.""

(Cache Power) to execute an engineering study for Cache Power’s Marguerite Lake Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES) and Hydrogen Hub Project near La Corey, Alberta, Canada.

The study is partially funded by a grant awarded by Alberta Innovates, a Canadian provincial crown corporation created and funded by the government of Alberta which is responsible for promoting innovation and economic growth in the province. The project will utilize B&W’s advanced BrightLoop™ energy production and decarbonization technology to support clean energy production and enable zero-emissions operation.

Cache Power is developing the 640-megawatt (MW) CAES facility next to the existing Marguerite Lake substation, which will be built in two identical 320 MW phases. The facility will store renewable energy from the grid in subterranean mined salt caverns in the form of compressed air and then release that air to generate electricity to meet grid demand.

The facility is designed to use natural gas or hydrogen to reheat the compressed air before it is expanded through turbines to generate electricity. B&W’s BrightLoop technology will be used to generate up to 60 tonnes-per-day of hydrogen for the facility, while also generating a nearly pure stream of carbon dioxide (CO2) for capture and storage, enabling the project to reach net-zero emissions.

“We thank Alberta Innovates for the support they’ve provided for this ground-breaking net-zero project and we thank Cache Power for their innovative mindset to add BrightLoop hydrogen generation to the project,” said B&W Chief Technology Officer Brandy Johnson. “BrightLoop’s versatility makes it an ideal solution for a wide variety of applications, including Cache Power’s novel CAES project.”

“We’re excited to begin engineering for this project and take the next step forward with Cache Power,” Johnson said.

“Our project represents a major step toward clean, dispatchable and long-duration energy storage in Alberta,” said Cache Power President Jordan Costley. “By combining compressed air energy storage with hydrogen production, storage and use, we’re creating a sustainable solution to support grid reliability while helping Alberta meet its decarbonization goals.”

B&W's BrightLoop process is a versatile and flexible chemical looping technology utilizing a proprietary oxide TranspO2rt™ particle for steam, hydrogen or syngas production with CO2 isolation and can be used for a wide range of applications. The BrightLoop system produces clean energy with complete in-situ CO.

North Dakota currently has 9,513 jobs in the clean energy sector, compared to around 30,000 directly employed in North Dakota’s oil and gas industry.
However, policy changes from the One Big Beautiful Bill repealing or phasing out certain Inflation Reduction Act clean energy tax credits and cuts to grants and federal programs related to the clean energy sector are expected to slow clean energy employment growth in the state.
The federal energy policy changes and funding repeals come at a time when energy demand is increasing, driven by the development of data centers, residential growth and other industrial developments.
The Politico report indicated that North Dakota Republican Sen. Kevin Cramer had confirmed the authenticity of the list.","BISMARCK — When federal solar funding was withdrawn earlier this year, Cody Two Bears had to inform dozens of tribal members that their jobs were no longer available.

“At full capacity, we were going to hire up to 60 people within our organization alone to disperse this project within five years,” said Two Bears, founder of Indigenized Energy on the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation. “I was up to about 30 employees. So, I was about halfway there within the first year of launching this program.”

Two Bears’ nonprofit had been preparing to manage a $135.6 million share of the now-canceled Solar For All program, which would have brought rooftop solar to thousands of low-income tribal homes across a five-state region.

When the program was scrapped, so were dozens of potential good-paying clean energy jobs.

“The part that really is frustrating is that we had a lot of hope, and we had a lot of opportunity,” Two Bears said. “That just kind of took the spirit out of our people. When you create a lot of opportunity and just take it away from people that need it the most, that’s really catastrophic.”

The loss of Solar For All has forced organizations like Indigenized Energy to scale back and pivot.

“There’s opportunity out there, but not as much anymore,” Two Bears said. “So, people are just pivoting and shifting and looking for alternatives, either alternative job placements for now, some are finding jobs within renewable energy or elsewhere that are more sustainable, just until we get through this storm, and understanding where this federal government’s going to head.”

Two Bears said the funding would have helped with long-term energy sovereignty for tribal nations participating in the program, and his nonprofit was going to be in it for the long haul, not only installing and training people to use the systems but also providing maintenance and upkeep so the systems would last.

A revolving fund from any profits off the systems as well as insurance policies would have been used to keep them intact going forward, he said.

The MHA Nation had estimated the program could have added around 8,500 rooftop solar installations to homes in its territory alone.

Indigenized Energy completed two ground-mounted residential solar projects with Solar For All funding before the program was cut, one on Oglala Sioux tribal land in South Dakota and a similar system on Chippewa Cree tribal land in Montana.

Dozens of members of both tribes were trained during those installation projects, with several later hired by the nonprofit or other contractors. Those projects presented an estimated savings of at or just above $1,000 annually per household connected to the system, according to the nonprofit.

Another nonprofit group, Coalition for Green Capital, was awarded $125 million through the Solar For All program to install rooftop solar projects in rural and tribal areas in both North and South Dakota. That award would have also targeted lower-income families.

Jobs in fields related to wind, solar, battery storage, energy efficiency and other clean energy sectors grew at their slowest pace since 2020 in North Dakota last year, according to data from a nonpartisan business group.

Still, by adding 300 jobs in 2024, those sectors continued to outpace job creation in other traditional energy sectors, which lost 685 jobs in the same time, the data from E2 and Evergreen Climate Innovations shows.

North Dakota currently has 9,513 jobs in the clean energy sector, compared to around 30,000 directly employed in North Dakota’s oil and gas industry.

“Just compared to the overall workforce, we do see that clean energy economy jobs are growing faster, and that’s certainly true for North Dakota, where you have clean energy jobs growing three and a half times faster than the overall economy,” Micaela Preskill, E2’s Director of State Advocacy, said of the 2024 data.

However, policy changes from the One Big Beautiful Bill repealing or phasing out certain Inflation Reduction Act clean energy tax credits and cuts to grants and federal programs related to the clean energy sector are expected to slow clean energy employment growth in the state.

Besides the impacts on Indigenized Energy, backtracking on infrastructure investments has also reduced hiring plans for other companies in the region.

Ryan Warner, co-owner of Lightspring Solar in Bismarck, said the company recently hired new staff to increase its numbers by around 30 to 40%.

If the recent federal cuts and tax changes hadn’t occurred, the company would have likely increased staff by 100 to 200% he said.

“We were expecting a lot more hiring with those grant dollars that got suspended or taken back,” Warner said. “We’re continuing to grow, but not at the same rate we would have otherwise, had those things gone forward.”

The growth of the sector remains to be seen and is dependent on the impact of the federal policy changes and cuts.

“It’s a really significant part of the overall workforce and economy,” E2’s Preskill said. “We’ve got to keep that trajectory going and find opportunities to make sure that these federal headwinds don’t impact this trajectory in a way that would be bad for North Dakota.”

Cass County had the most clean energy-related jobs with 2,629, followed by Burleigh County with 1,304, Grand Forks County with 844, Williams County with 820 and Ward County with 798.

The federal energy policy changes and funding repeals come at a time when energy demand is increasing, driven by the development of data centers, residential growth and other industrial developments.

The need for energy from a variety of sources — whether from renewables or traditional sources — continues to grow.

The changes also come as electricity costs in North Dakota rose at an estimated 5.5% over the past year, largely driven by increased use by data centers as well as grid strain and transmission congestion fees.

In September, Basin Electric Power Cooperative authorized a rate increase of $6 per megawatt-hour for its customers, an increase of around 10%, starting on Jan. 1. A 19% rate hike for customers of Xcel Energy in the eastern part of the state is also proposed, potentially raising costs on average by around $270 annually if approved.

A report released by Grid Strategies LLC at the end of 2024 predicts energy demand will grow nationally by 16% over the next five years, necessitating the addition of around 128 gigawatts of new electricity capacity by 2029.

“Obviously, the energy industry is very important to North Dakota, and one macro trend that we see is that power is in demand,” said Ian Adams, managing director at Evergreen Climate Innovations.

Adams said while overall load growth had long been flat, demand is now increasing significantly.

“So, the ability to deliver new sources of power is important,” Adams said. “In a world where we are short of power, and in an environment where we need significantly more power, where we’re not replacing, we’re adding, there’s a lot of opportunity, I think, for the energy space in North Dakota.”

E2 and Evergreen Climate Innovations have already tracked $22 billion in canceled clean energy funding and related private investments stemming from federal policy changes, reducing the ability to add new power sources fast enough.

Other potential funding cuts include major projects like Project Tundra, a carbon-sequestration project tied to the Milton R. Young Station coal-fired power plant, and the Heartland Hydrogen Hub.

The cuts were flagged by reporting in early October by Politico’s E&E News regarding a U.S. Department of Energy list that has recently been circulating on Capitol Hill.

A Minnkota Power Cooperative spokesperson, the power company backing Project Tundra, said the company was aware of the reports but hadn’t received any communication or notice regarding changes in the project’s status from the DOE.

The Politico report indicated that North Dakota Republican Sen. Kevin Cramer had confirmed the authenticity of the list.

Cramer told NDNC on Oct. 23 that he did authenticate the list and that it had cast a “very broad net” and that it prompted pushback from his office and the rest of the North Dakota congressional delegation to the DOE.

Cramer said neither Project Tundra nor the Heartland Hydrogen hub developers received official notice of any changes to funding. He did say that if they were to receive such notification, they should prepare to appeal.

“My advice to people at these projects is at least start the research piece and prepare carefully and prepare to appeal if you get it,” Cramer said.

As far as impacts to other programs like Solar For All, Cramer said that because it originated in the Inflation Reduction Act, targeting it was “significant to the current administration.”

Another program in uncertainty is LIHEAP, or the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, a federal program helping lower-income people cover energy costs.

Funding for 2025 has already been distributed to states, and North Dakota’s Department of Health and Human Services said it is still operating normally for the nearly 38,000 individuals who access those funds in the state.

Changes to the application process for LIHEAP were made in the OBBB this summer, and there are open questions about how it will be funded for 2026 due to the current debate over the federal budget package.

“One thing we need to do is get the government open so that money can flow,” Cramer said, adding that more needs to be done to get energy prices down — particularly heating fuels and natural gas — which would also help reduce costs to residents.

“LIHEAP remains a lifeline for people in our part of the country,” Cramer said.",https://cdn.forumcomm.com/dims4/default/a77de15/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1280x853+0+0/resize/1600x1066!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fforum-communications-production-web.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F4a%2Fe9%2F1771c12f410688344f44898938b4%2Fostcharlee2.jpeg,N,,2025-10-28 08:19:14.139841

When combined with all the cuts to clean energy initiatives, the pro-fossil, anti-renewable effect is magnified.","Samuel Corum/Getty Images

In July, President Trump signed into law the spuriously-named “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” (OBBB), a sprawling budget package with severe and far-reaching impacts, from restricting healthcare access, to slashing nutrition assistance, to exploding the national deficit, to impeding the deployment of clean energy solutions.

The OBBB’s energy-related provisions could not come at a worse time for the electricity system, or the people, businesses, and critical infrastructure relying upon it.

Energy bills are soaring, aging power plants are retiring, an underinvested grid is faltering, and electricity demand is newly surging, particularly as a result of AI-driven data center buildout.

The Trump administration is actively exacerbating the electricity system’s challenges by unilaterally halting construction of nearly completed clean energy projects, yanking support of permitted grid infrastructure and pulling billions in funding for more, imposing steep—and shifting—tariffs on vital energy system inputs, and explicitly restricting permitting of wind- and solar-powered generation projects.

Instead of countering these attacks and delivering urgently needed solutions, however, the OBBB—written and passed along partisan lines—cuts a similar path. Again and again, the OBBB makes changes to existing energy policies to restrict access to, and hike the costs of, the fastest, cheapest, and cleanest resources to deploy: wind, solar, batteries, grid infrastructure, and energy efficiency.

As a result, the OBBB’s energy implications are severe:

Electricity rates will increase, on the order of 10 to 18 percent by 2035;

Renewables deployment will decrease, on the order of 57 to 62 percent over the next 10 years;

Grid reliability will be strained, as electricity demand surges while electricity supply solutions are held back;

Clean energy jobs will be lost, with the solar industry alone warning of the potential for hundreds of thousands of jobs lost over the next few years;

Advanced manufacturing will be undermined, putting hundreds of billions of dollars of forward-looking investments at risk;

Global leadership in innovation will be ceded, as the government pulls investments in pioneering research, development, and deployment in the technologies of the future; and

Emissions reductions will slow, primarily by prolonging the use of coal and increasing the use of gas in the power sector, abandoning energy efficiency initiatives, and slowing the shift to electric vehicles.

Below, a closer look at the specific policy changes that are driving these impacts, with particular attention to the revised clean electricity tax credits given their outsized impact.

Clean Electricity Tax Credits (45Y/48E)

The OBBB’s single most impactful change to energy policy is its massive revision of the clean electricity tax credits (also sometimes referred to by their place in the tax code, sections 45Y and 48E). Tax policy has been extraordinarily effective in helping to drive clean energy deployment; updates passed in 2022 further strengthened its potential. First, the tax credits were made technology-neutral, meaning any type of electricity resource could access the same credits so long as it met an emissions eligibility threshold. Second, credit phase out was tied to either 2033 or the electricity system meeting overall emissions-reduction targets, whichever date comes later, thereby providing investors with needed long-run market certainty while anchoring the incentive to achieving clear—and directly related—policy goals.

The OBBB attacks both of these foundational points, restricting eligibility of certain technologies and abruptly upending that vital long-run market certainty.

Severe restrictions on wind and solar: Wind and solar resources are explicitly targeted for rapid tax credit phase-out through two changes: howthese resources can qualify for the tax credit and dramatically shortening for how longthey can qualify.

Projects beginning construction by July 4, 2026: For one year following bill passage, wind and solar projects can still access the tax credit based on when they begin construction.

Note: In reality, this brief one-year window is even more constrained; just days after signing the law, President Trump issued an executive order directing the Treasury Department to narrow the long-standing definition of “begin construction”—which Treasury then did, further limiting wind and solar projects’ ability to qualify for safe harbor provisions.

Projects beginning construction after July 4, 2026: For all wind and solar projects beginning construction after July 4, 2026, project eligibility is switched from when the project begins construction to when a project is placed in service, with a deadline of the end of 2027. This is a calamitous change for complex projects—especially wind, but also some solar—that can take years to plan, permit, construct, and fully enter into service, meaning for many wind and solar projects, the credit effectively closes with the July 2026 transition.

Broader 45Y/48E credit phase-out: Separate from the rapid wind and solar credit phase-out, the remainder of the clean electricity tax credits—including for battery storage projects—are phased out beginning in 2034, with the OBBB striking the alternative emissions reduction phaseout timeline, which had been anticipated to stretch many years longer. For these projects, eligibility remains tied to the beginning of construction.

“Prohibited Foreign Entity” rules: In addition to faster phase-outs, the OBBB also adds complex foreign entity restrictions for projects to navigate beginning in 2026, including restrictions on the supply chain of materials and components used in projects, the ownership of projects, and the financing of projects. These rules are intended to limit prohibited foreign entities—namely, China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea, as well as other specified foreign entities—from benefitting directly or indirectly from the credits. In practice, however, the restrictions threaten to be so entirely unworkable as to effectively render the impacted credits unusable.

New loophole for fuel cells: The OBBB carves out a loophole specifically for fuel cells, allowing them to access the full 30 percent investment tax credit without regard for the emissions threshold requirement—the fundamental prerequisite of technology-neutral clean electricity tax credits. Critically, fuel cells running on natural gas can have high carbon dioxide emission rates, meaning they are nowhere near “clean” and would never qualify without this new loophole.

Impact

Following the 2022 updates to the clean electricity tax credits, studies repeatedly found that these incentives had the potential to drive enormous amounts of renewable energy onto the grid over the next decade-plus, helping to hold down electricity costs and ease supply constraints—exactly as the moment demands.

Post-OBBB changes, however, analyses are now finding that wind, solar, and storage deployment could be dramatically curtailed over the coming decade and beyond—exactly the opposite of what the moment demands.

For example, Energy Innovation, a nonpartisan think tank, forecasts a staggering 340 gigawatt (GW) decrease in generation capacity added to the system over the next decade, led by approximately 200 GW less wind, 150 GW less solar, and 17 GW less battery storage—plus 19 GW more of natural gas capacity than would have otherwise occurred. Numerous additional studies find similarly massive contractions in anticipated clean deployment.

Tighter electricity supply, plus increased costs for the generation that still gets built, plus higher natural gas prices because of increased fossil gas use, all lead to muchhigher electricity costs. By Energy Innovation’s estimate, compared to a pre-OBBB scenario, electricity prices could increase 25 percent by 2030 and 74 percent by 2035, translating to electricity rate increases of 10 to 18 percent by 2035.

When sky-rocketing electricity demand is layered on top, something has to give: either electricity growth is slower—meaning constrained AI development, as well as constrained opportunities for new manufacturing and rapid electrification of end uses—or it all still happens, just at a much higher cost, paid for in higher electricity bills.

Consumer-Facing Tax Credits

In addition to slashing incentives for larger-scale renewables deployment, the OBBB also slashed consumer-facing opportunities to participate in the clean energy transition, including through investments in rooftop solar, energy efficiency and weatherization, and electric vehicles—except here, the OBBB cuts are even more severe:

Residential clean electricity (25D): This credit allows people to claim refunds equivalent to 30 percent of system costs for residential clean energy investments, including rooftop solar, batteries, small-scale wind, and geothermal heat pumps. The credit had been set to start phasing out in 2033; the OBBB imposed an abrupt end date of December 31, 2025.

Energy efficiency (25C, 45L, 179D): These credits incentivize energy efficient construction, appliances, and building upgrades in homes and commercial buildings. The credits had been set to phase out at the end of 2032 (or were permanent, in the case of 179D); the OBBB imposed abrupt end dates of December 31, 2025, for 25C, and for projects beginning construction after June 30, 2026, for 45L and 179D.

Clean vehicle and charging tax credits (30D, 25E, 30C): These credits facilitate the purchase of new (30D) and used (25E) clean vehicles and the deployment of charging infrastructure. The credits had been set to phase out at the end of 2032; after changes in the OBBB, the vehicle credits are now already expired, with the law forcing an end date of September 30, 2025, and the charging credits will be terminated for projects placed in service after June 30, 2026.

Impact

These rapid phase-outs hit hard on two fronts.

First, they significantly undermine the transition to cleaner energy sources and cleaner and more efficient energy uses at the consumer level—exactly when the electricity system should be maximizing investments in energy efficiency and encouraging the uptake of distributed energy resources. Post-OBBB changes, however, people will be stuck with higher energy bills or paying more out-of-pocket to make changes, and the grid will be more strained than it otherwise would because of forfeited opportunities for efficiency, which has the net effect of further driving up system costs—and therefore consumer costs as well.

Second, these rapid phase-outs undermine the broader growth in the clean energy economy that was spun up to meet anticipated demand, ranging from small businesses all the way to billion-plus dollar manufacturing facilities. Now, the critical long-run market certainty that these investments had been predicated on is upended and many of those jobs, investments, and plans are already being lost.

Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit

The advanced manufacturing production credit (45X) was created in 2022 to incentivize the domestic production of the components used in clean technologies, including solar, wind, and battery components; inverters; and critical minerals. When passed, 45X was slated to phase out beginning in 2030 except for critical minerals, which did not have a phase-out date.

The OBBB preserved some elements of 45X, but also made numerous changes:

Ends credits for wind energy components after 2027;

Adds metallurgical coal—which is overwhelmingly exported—as a covered critical mineral through 2029;

Adds a phase-out date for other critical minerals, now beginning in 2031;

Maintains the previous phase out period, 2030 to 2032, for all other components; and

Layers on numerous and complex prohibited foreign entity restrictions.

Impact

Manufacturing investments skyrocketed in the aftermath of the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022, which powerfully used policies spurring supply and demand to help the US boost its development of domestic clean energy manufacturing and supply chains. Now, the OBBB is undermining both sides of the equation, and already tens of billions of dollars of project cancellations are stacking up as a result.

Beyond slashing investments, this cuts jobs and paychecks, as well as undermines efforts to limit the country’s risky dependencies on geopolitically fraught supply chains. These changes also have the long-tail effect of undermining US leadership in the development of forward-looking technologies.

Clawing Back Climate and Clean Energy Funds

In addition to making major changes to energy tax incentives, the OBBB also ransacked numerous existing grant and loan programs intended to support research through deployment of clean energy technologies, as well as transparency and solutions around the presence of, and harms from, fossil fuel pollution.

Most of the OBBB changes constituted the clawing back of “unobligated” program funds, which includes funds that have not yet been awarded as well as funds that have been awarded but not yet fully contracted. Separately, the administration is attempting to also claw back funds that have already been obligated, including the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund—a subject of ongoing litigation. If the administration succeeds, then those “de-obligated” funds could potentially be rescinded, too.

Of the many programs subject to rescissions under the OBBB, two key areas of impact stand out:

Slashing DOE’s loan programs, repurposing what remains: The OBBB did not fully dismantle the Loan Programs Office (LPO) but it did severely hamstring it by rescinding credit subsidies, in whole or in part. This means even where substantial loan authority remains, the LPO is majorly constrained in its ability to actually use that authority to advance innovative and forward-looking solutions in clean energy, electricity infrastructure, vehicles, and projects in tribal communities. Furthermore, the OBBB repurposed the Energy Infrastructure Reinvestment Program, by far the largest LPO program with $250 million in lending authority, to be the “Energy Dominance Financing” program, struck its requirements for projects to reduce emissions and analyze community impacts, and added requirements that threaten to exclude wind and solar.

Cutting grants for community-based programs: The OBBB rescinded billions of dollars in funding for programs intended to increase access to, and uptake of, clean energy solutions, as well as help communities identify and mitigate sources of pollution harms. These programs—such as the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, Climate Pollution Reduction Grants, and Community Change Grants—were especially notable for the degree to which they attempted to support environmental justice and local solutions for local problems, including for low-income and disadvantaged communities who have long been overlooked.

These programs, as well as parallel programs focused on jump-starting industrial decarbonization, were important for their ability to reach the people and projects where tax policy has limited effectiveness and regulatory gaps remain. Moreover, they were often specifically intended to catalyze significantly more capital, and significantly more projects. The loss in grant funding and loan authority is, therefore, many times greater than the dollar amounts.

There is also the fact that cutting off these programs now fully undermines the capacity and expertise developed to support these programs and communities, as well as the additional capital already committed in response.

The enormity of wasted time, wasted money, and worst of all, wasted opportunity, is staggering.

Additional Energy Policy Changes

Alongside revisions to the major clean energy tax incentives, the OBBB also inserted changes to multiple other pieces of energy tax policy either directly or indirectly related to the power sector, including:

Credit for carbon capture (45Q): The 45Q credit provides a subsidy for capturing carbon dioxide from polluting industrial facilities and fossil fuel-fired power plants, and a higher incentive for direct air capture. Previously, 45Q assigned greater value to projects that directed carbon dioxide to long-term storage; the OBBB modified the credit such that carbon dioxide that is subsequently reused or deployed for enhanced oil recovery—ultimately meaning more carbon dioxide produced—can now receive the same high value. The OBBB did not change the credit phase out, which is set to sunset after 2032, but it did add complex foreign entity restrictions, beginning in 2026.

Credit for existing nuclear power production (45U): The 45U credit, created in 2022, is specifically intended to provide limited economic support to existing nuclear power plants, varying based on economic need. The OBBB retained the 2032 sunset date, but added restrictions related to prohibited foreign entities (excluding nuclear fuels).

Credit for clean hydrogen production (45V): The 45V tax credit, also launched in 2022, is intended to support the production of clean hydrogen. The OBBB did not change the credit’s underlying framework; however, it drew forward the credit phase-out from projects beginning construction after 2032 to projects beginning construction after 2027.

Separately, the OBBB added numerous plus-ups for fossil fuels, including lowering royalty rates; mandating coal, oil, and gas lease sales; expediting fossil-based project permitting, including pay-to-play provisions; and removing fees penalizing methane pollution from oil and gas operations. Together these changes make it easier, quicker, and cheaper to extract, transport, and use fossil fuels. When combined with all the cuts to clean energy initiatives, the pro-fossil, anti-renewable effect is magnified.

Raising Costs, Losing Jobs, Slashing Investments, Increasing Emissions, Ceding Leadership

The OBBB is a sprawling law with impacts stretching far beyond energy and climate. But its attacks on forward-looking climate and clean energy policies mirror many of the additional provisions in the law, which again and again and again result in an overall shift in resources away from the people and priorities who need it most.

Now, because of the OBBB’s relentless attacks on proven energy policies working to drive the country’s energy system forward, everyone from individuals to communities to entire industries will be forced to pay a towering price, from higher energy bills, to lost jobs, to cancelled investments, to increased pollution, to ceded technological leadership, to undermined resilience in the face of a rapidly evolving climate and a rapidly evolving economy.",https://blog.ucs.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Blog-Thumbnail-Trump-Signing-OBBBA.jpg,N,,2025-10-28 08:18:44.906149

The document, signed by Christopher Lehane, Chief Global Affairs Officer at OpenAI, was shared publicly alongside a LinkedIn post from OpenAI Global Affairs highlighting the key themes of the proposal.

OpenAI described AI as a “once-in-a-century opportunity” to modernize the US economy, expand domestic manufacturing, and reinforce national security. According to the submission, “the United States currently leads the world in developing artificial intelligence—an advantage that ensures that AI will be built to benefit as many people as possible, not just a few.”

OpenAI’s internal analysis projects that an initial $1 trillion invested in AI infrastructure could result in more than 5 percent additional US GDP growth over three years. The company’s Stargate initiative, six large-scale data center sites under construction in Texas, New Mexico, Ohio, and Wisconsin, represents nearly seven gigawatts of planned capacity and more than $400 billion in investment over the next three years.

OpenAI said it remains on track to reach its full $500 billion, 10 GW commitment by the end of 2025, ahead of schedule, with additional sites under evaluation across the country. “The country will need many more electricians, mechanics, metal and ironworkers, carpenters, plumbers and other construction trade workers than we currently have,” the company stated.

Addressing America’s “electron gap”

A central focus of the submission is energy capacity. OpenAI warned that the United States risks falling behind the People’s Republic of China (PRC), which added 429 gigawatts of new power capacity in 2024. more than one-third of the total US grid. By comparison, the United States added just 51 GW.

OpenAI called on OSTP to set an ambitious national goal of building 100 GW of new energy capacity each year to close what it described as the “electron gap.” “Electricity is a strategic asset—it underpins the US AI advantage and in turn, our economic competitiveness, technological leadership, and national security,” the submission stated.

The company also supported recent Department of Energy steps to streamline state-level permitting, noting that faster grid expansion is key to sustaining AI development.

To support the AI buildout, OpenAI proposed an industrial strategy aimed at reducing reliance on foreign supply chains for semiconductors, metals, and other critical inputs. The submission recommends expanding the Advanced Manufacturing Investment Credit (AMIC) to cover grid components, AI servers, and data centers, while deploying federal grants and loans to scale US production of materials such as copper, aluminum, and electrical steel.

It also urged the creation of a national Strategic Reserve for essential AI materials, modeled after the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. “This reserve would provide domestic producers with the certainty they need to expand production,” OpenAI wrote, adding that it would help stabilize prices and reduce dependence on the PRC.

OpenAI outlined detailed proposals to streamline federal permitting processes that currently delay infrastructure projects. It suggested tightening Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) timelines, expanding use of curtailable load resources, and accelerating environmental reviews under the Clean Water and Clean Air Acts.

The company also noted it is already working with US National Laboratories to use AI to optimize and accelerate permitting. “At OpenAI, we are bringing new power online to support sites like our flagship Stargate campus in Abilene,” the submission said. “Our data centers are designed to be curtailable—reducing their draw or even returning power during peak demand, helping to protect reliability and avoid higher costs for consumers.”

Building America’s AI workforce

OpenAI’s Workforce Blueprint forms another key section of the RFI response. The company proposes large-scale federal investment in workforce development through community colleges and trade schools, supported by federal funding streams such as the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act.

Through the OpenAI Certifications and Jobs Platform, launching in 2026, the company plans to connect its Stargate sites with local training and education programs. Its long-term goal is to certify 10 million Americans in AI fluency by 2030.

“Nearly 2.5 million Americans already have engaged with our AI literacy content through the OpenAI Academy learning platform,” the document states. “Launch partners ranging from Walmart to the Texas Association of Business, representing thousands of smaller businesses, will help ensure that enterprises of all sizes are able to provide training for their employees.”

National security and standards

The final section of OpenAI’s submission centers on safeguarding national security while maintaining the country’s innovation lead. It recommends strengthening the Center for AI Standards and Innovation (CAISI) as a single federal hub for AI evaluation, standards development, and industry collaboration.

Proposals include exempting sensitive technical data shared with CAISI from public disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, modernizing cybersecurity frameworks under the Department of War, and expanding the government’s classified cloud capacity through a proposed “Classified Stargate” initiative.

The submission also calls for updates to data residency and accessibility rules to enable secure experimentation with non-sensitive data, and for alignment of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) AI Risk Management Framework with existing US laws such as HIPAA and Reg SCI.

OpenAI concluded its submission by urging the US government to “think big, act big, and build big.” It emphasized the need for a coordinated approach spanning energy, education, and manufacturing.

Christopher Lehane wrote: “We see this reindustrialization as a foundational way for the US to ‘predistribute’ the economic benefits of the Intelligence Age from the very start.

An audio recording of the Executive Summary reading the statement is available below.

We are in a new era of climate action and ambition. Countries are setting national climate targets – and plans to achieve them – that differ in pace and scale to any that have come before.

Ten years after we adopted the Paris Agreement, we can say simply – it is delivering real progress. But it must work much faster and fairer, and that acceleration must start now.

The scale and severity of the climate crisis has never been clearer. Brutal climate-driven droughts, floods, storms and wildfires are hitting every nation harder each year, wrecking millions of lives and vital infrastructure, taking shreds off GDP and pushing up prices.

At the same time, the opportunities in climate action are monumental.

The rewards for those taking strong climate actions are measured in millions of new jobs and trillions in new investment. As the global shift to clean energy continues to scale, the dividends to follow will be far greater still, as climate action emerges as the economic growth and jobs engine of the 21st century.

Market logic dictates that this clean energy transition will continue at great scale and pace. But an equitable global transition – where every country benefits from clean energy and climate resilience – requires clear policies and plans, across every country and every sector, and more support for many nations, especially those that did least to cause this global crisis.

Today’s NDC Synthesis Report provides valuable new data, both about progress being made and the major challenges still remaining, although this data is limited to those national climate plans formally submitted by September 30.

Starting with the former:

This new generation of NDCs show a step-change in terms of quality, credibility and economic breadth.

NDCs are increasingly responding to the Global Stocktake, with 88% of countries saying their NDC was informed by the outcomes of the GST, and 81% indicating specifically how this was the case.

Countries are increasingly taking a whole-of-economy, whole-of-society approach, with 89% containing economy-wide targets.

Adaptation and resilience are becoming increasingly important. Almost three-quarters (73%) of new NDCs include adaptation components.

Parties – especially from Small Island Developing States – are also increasingly integrating Loss and Damage as a core component of their NDCs.

Significant progress has also been made on integrating into NDCs elements on gender, stakeholder and youth engagement, just-transitions, the roles of forests and oceans, and on Article 6, carbon markets.

NDCs submitted are broadly consistent with a linear trajectory from 2030 targets to long-term net zero targets.

While we caution against drawing global conclusions from this report, it still contains some green shoots of good news: countries are making progress, and laying out clear stepping stones towards net-zero emissions.

We also know that change is not linear and that some countries have a history of overdelivering.

We are equally mindful that the data set in today's report provides quite a limited picture, as the NDCs it synthesizes represent around one-third of global emissions.

In order to provide a wider picture of global progress ahead of COP30, we have done some additional calculations which also capture new NDCs or targets submitted or announced up to publication of this report, and including at the Secretary-General's Climate Summit in New York.

This wider picture, though still incomplete, shows global emissions falling by around 10% by 2035.

Through UN-convened climate cooperation and national efforts, humanity is now clearly bending the emissions curve downwards for the first time, although still not nearly fast enough.

So while the direction of travel is improving every year, we have a serious need for more speed, and for helping more countries take stronger climate actions.

But this is why the Paris Agreement has a ratchet mechanism, to keep raising climate ambition, until collectively we are on track to avoid the worst climate impacts by limiting warming to 1.5°C this century, as science demands.

The science is equally clear that temperatures absolutely can and must be brought back down to 1.5°C as quickly as possible after any temporary overshoot, by substantially stepping up the pace on all fronts.

That acceleration must start now. Much more support will be needed for many, especially those who did least to cause this global crisis.

But we are not starting from nothing. Indeed we should draw encouragement and impetus from vast movement in the real economy, particularly the huge investment flows into clean energy in nearly all major economies.

From recent data, for example, showing renewables surpassed coal as the world's largest energy source this year.

From recent history, showing how quickly things can change, and change faster.

The boom in clean energy, infrastructure, and the efficient, data-driven, innovative technologies needed to connect them to our daily lives, stands to surpass anything we’ve seen before.

So the broader picture is of a world which is already paying a huge price from global heating, but which is also nearing positive economic tipping points – towards a safer, healthier, wealthier world, powered by clean energy and climate resilience.

So it’s now for COP30 and for the world to respond and show how we are going to speed up. It must do three things:

It must send a clear signal: nations are still fully on board for climate cooperation, because it works but must work faster, and that means achieving concrete and strong outcomes on all key issues.

“At full capacity, we were going to hire up to 60 people within our organization alone to disperse this project within five years,” said Two Bears, founder of Indigenized Energy on the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation. “I was up to about 30 employees. So, I was about halfway there within the first year of launching this program.”

Two Bears’ nonprofit had been preparing to manage a $135.6 million share of the now-canceled Solar For All program, which would have brought rooftop solar to thousands of low-income tribal homes across a five-state region.

When the program was scrapped, so were dozens of potential good-paying clean energy jobs.

“The part that really is frustrating is that we had a lot of hope, and we had a lot of opportunity,” Two Bears said. “That just kind of took the spirit out of our people. When you create a lot of opportunity and just take it away from people that need it the most, that’s really catastrophic.”

The loss of Solar For All has forced organizations like Indigenized Energy to scale back and pivot.

“There’s opportunity out there, but not as much anymore,” Two Bears said. “So, people are just pivoting and shifting and looking for alternatives, either alternative job placements for now, some are finding jobs within renewable energy or elsewhere that are more sustainable, just until we get through this storm, and understanding where this federal government’s going to head.”

Two Bears said the funding would have helped with long-term energy sovereignty for tribal nations participating in the program, and his nonprofit was going to be in it for the long haul, not only installing and training people to use the systems but also providing maintenance and upkeep so the systems would last.

A revolving fund from any profits off the systems as well as insurance policies would have been used to keep them intact going forward, he said.

The MHA Nation had estimated the program could have added around 8,500 rooftop solar installations to homes in its territory alone.

Indigenized Energy completed two ground-mounted residential solar projects with Solar For All funding before the program was cut, one on Oglala Sioux tribal land in South Dakota and a similar system on Chippewa Cree tribal land in Montana.

Dozens of members of both tribes were trained during those installation projects, with several later hired by the nonprofit or other contractors. Those projects presented an estimated savings of at or just above $1,000 annually per household connected to the system, according to the nonprofit.

Another nonprofit group, Coalition for Green Capital, was awarded $125 million through the Solar For All program to install rooftop solar projects in rural and tribal areas in both North and South Dakota. That award would have also targeted lower-income families.

Jobs in fields related to wind, solar, battery storage, energy efficiency and other clean energy sectors grew at their slowest pace since 2020 in North Dakota last year, according to data from a nonpartisan business group.

Still, by adding 300 jobs in 2024, those sectors continued to outpace job creation in other traditional energy sectors, which lost 685 jobs in the same time, the data from E2 and Evergreen Climate Innovations shows.

North Dakota currently has 9,513 jobs in the clean energy sector, compared to around 30,000 directly employed in North Dakota’s oil and gas industry.

“Just compared to the overall workforce, we do see that clean energy economy jobs are growing faster, and that’s certainly true for North Dakota, where you have clean energy jobs growing three and a half times faster than the overall economy,” Micaela Preskill, E2’s Director of State Advocacy, said of the 2024 data.

However, policy changes from the One Big Beautiful Bill repealing or phasing out certain Inflation Reduction Act clean energy tax credits and cuts to grants and federal programs related to the clean energy sector are expected to slow clean energy employment growth in the state.

Besides the impacts on Indigenized Energy, backtracking on infrastructure investments has also reduced hiring plans for other companies in the region.

Ryan Warner, co-owner of Lightspring Solar in Bismarck, said the company recently hired new staff to increase its numbers by around 30 to 40%.

If the recent federal cuts and tax changes hadn’t occurred, the company would have likely increased staff by 100 to 200% he said.

“We were expecting a lot more hiring with those grant dollars that got suspended or taken back,” Warner said. “We’re continuing to grow, but not at the same rate we would have otherwise, had those things gone forward.”

The growth of the sector remains to be seen and is dependent on the impact of the federal policy changes and cuts.

“It’s a really significant part of the overall workforce and economy,” E2’s Preskill said. “We’ve got to keep that trajectory going and find opportunities to make sure that these federal headwinds don’t impact this trajectory in a way that would be bad for North Dakota.”

Cass County had the most clean energy-related jobs with 2,629, followed by Burleigh County with 1,304, Grand Forks County with 844, Williams County with 820 and Ward County with 798.

The federal energy policy changes and funding repeals come at a time when energy demand is increasing, driven by the development of data centers, residential growth and other industrial developments.

The need for energy from a variety of sources — whether from renewables or traditional sources — continues to grow.

The changes also come as electricity costs in North Dakota rose at an estimated 5.5% over the past year, largely driven by increased use by data centers as well as grid strain and transmission congestion fees.

In September, Basin Electric Power Cooperative authorized a rate increase of $6 per megawatt-hour for its customers, an increase of around 10%, starting on Jan. 1. A 19% rate hike for customers of Xcel Energy in the eastern part of the state is also proposed, potentially raising costs on average by around $270 annually if approved.

A report released by Grid Strategies LLC at the end of 2024 predicts energy demand will grow nationally by 16% over the next five years, necessitating the addition of around 128 gigawatts of new electricity capacity by 2029.

“Obviously, the energy industry is very important to North Dakota, and one macro trend that we see is that power is in demand,” said Ian Adams, managing director at Evergreen Climate Innovations.

Adams said while overall load growth had long been flat, demand is now increasing significantly.

“So, the ability to deliver new sources of power is important,” Adams said. “In a world where we are short of power, and in an environment where we need significantly more power, where we’re not replacing, we’re adding, there’s a lot of opportunity, I think, for the energy space in North Dakota.”

E2 and Evergreen Climate Innovations have already tracked $22 billion in canceled clean energy funding and related private investments stemming from federal policy changes, reducing the ability to add new power sources fast enough.

Other potential funding cuts include major projects like Project Tundra, a carbon-sequestration project tied to the Milton R. Young Station coal-fired power plant, and the Heartland Hydrogen Hub.

The cuts were flagged by reporting in early October by Politico’s E&E News regarding a U.S. Department of Energy list that has recently been circulating on Capitol Hill.

A Minnkota Power Cooperative spokesperson, the power company backing Project Tundra, said the company was aware of the reports but hadn’t received any communication or notice regarding changes in the project’s status from the DOE.

The Politico report indicated that North Dakota Republican Sen. Kevin Cramer had confirmed the authenticity of the list.

Cramer told NDNC on Oct. 23 that he did authenticate the list and that it had cast a “very broad net” and that it prompted pushback from his office and the rest of the North Dakota congressional delegation to the DOE.

Cramer said neither Project Tundra nor the Heartland Hydrogen hub developers received official notice of any changes to funding. He did say that if they were to receive such notification, they should prepare to appeal.

“My advice to people at these projects is at least start the research piece and prepare carefully and prepare to appeal if you get it,” Cramer said.

As far as impacts to other programs like Solar For All, Cramer said that because it originated in the Inflation Reduction Act, targeting it was “significant to the current administration.”

Another program in uncertainty is LIHEAP, or the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, a federal program helping lower-income people cover energy costs.

Funding for 2025 has already been distributed to states, and North Dakota’s Department of Health and Human Services said it is still operating normally for the nearly 38,000 individuals who access those funds in the state.

Changes to the application process for LIHEAP were made in the OBBB this summer, and there are open questions about how it will be funded for 2026 due to the current debate over the federal budget package.

“One thing we need to do is get the government open so that money can flow,” Cramer said, adding that more needs to be done to get energy prices down — particularly heating fuels and natural gas — which would also help reduce costs to residents.

“LIHEAP remains a lifeline for people in our part of the country,” Cramer said.",https://cdn.forumcomm.com/dims4/default/a77de15/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1280x853+0+0/resize/1600x1066!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fforum-communications-production-web.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F4a%2Fe9%2F1771c12f410688344f44898938b4%2Fostcharlee2.jpeg,N,,2025-10-28 11:00:37.063689

Few companies embody the industrial and cultural legacy of the United States as powerfully as General Motors (NYSE: GM). Founded well over a century ago, GM has served as a manufacturing bellwether, an innovation engine, and a symbol of American capitalism's global reach. Today, the company finds itself straddling the past and future with equal levels of urgency. Its present reality is largely defined by strong cash flows, resilient profitability, and a market valuation that potentially understates its intrinsic worth. Yet this bedrock of financial strength is offset by a seriously volatile macroeconomic landscape, technological disruption, and persistent skepticism regarding its growth trajectory, particularly in the realm of EV/AVs.

At a forward P/E of 5.36, dramatically lower than the sector median of 18.1, GM is potentially trading at a steep discount. It generated $23 billion in operating cash last year, compared to the industry median of $287 million, making it a financial outlier. And yet, this abundance has clearly not translated into investor enthusiasm: the stock holds a Hold consensus from analysts, myself included. This contradiction begs for further scrutiny. So is GM a deep-value opportunity overlooked due to temporary growth stagnation, or are there structural headwinds that justify the market's hesitancy?

I. A Legacy Engineered: GM's Structural Anatomy and Global Blueprint

Founded in 1908 in the heart of Detroit, GM rapidly evolved into a manufacturing empire. Today, it is a global automotive conglomerate with operations in over 100 countries and manufacturing facilities strategically spread across North America, South America, Asia, and Europe. GM is divided into four major segments: GM North America (GMNA), GM International (GMI), Cruise (the autonomous vehicle unit), and GM Financial (the captive finance arm).

In North America, the firm commands one of the most dominant market positions with a portfolio that spans the mass-market Chevrolet to the luxury of Cadillac. The company has regained its leadership in the U.S. auto market, capturing a healthy 16.5% of market share in 2023, thanks to a renewed focus on SUVs, crossovers, and trucks, vehicle types that enjoy higher margins and align with consumer preferences.

GM International, covering markets like China, South America, and the Middle East, remains more of a mixed bag. In China, GM operates joint ventures with SAIC and Wuling, leveraging the strength of local brands like Baojun and Wuling. Despite its long and established presence, GM's sales in China have faced steady decline due to rising competition, aggressive pricing from domestic EV makers, and evolving regulatory pressures.

Cruise, the autonomous division, is a major bet on long-term innovation. While Cruise initially set its sights on urban robotaxis, it has since recalibrated its focus toward personal autonomous vehicles, a move that prioritizes feasibility and near-term returns.

GM Financial, meanwhile, plays a far more strategic role than mere lending. With a 39% penetration rate in U.S. retail sales, it enables GM to capture enormous value across the entire vehicle ownership lifecycle. Its offerings include lease financing, dealership loans, and software-enabled subscription services, forming a recurring revenue stream that complements traditional car sales.

II. Electrification and Autonomy: A Two-Pronged Innovation Drive

GM's vision of the future is encapsulated in its corporate slogan: zero crashes, zero emissions, zero congestion. To realize this, the automaker is allocating tens of billions toward electrification and autonomy, anchoring its strategy in scalable platforms, technology, and vertically integrated manufacturing.

At the core of GM's EV strategy lies the Ultium battery platform, a modular propulsion system that can accommodate a wide range of the company's vehicle sizes and types. This innovation allows GM to massively streamline its supply chain, cut manufacturing costs, and accelerate production. Factory ZERO, the company's flagship EV facility in Detroit-Hamtramck, represents the convergence of legacy manufacturing with next-generation EV technology. Similarly, CAMI Assembly in Canada has been retooled to produce the BrightDrop Zevo 600 electric van, underscoring management's commitment to full-fleet electrification over time.

The company is aggressively securing its battery supply chain through joint ventures with LG Energy Solution (Ultium Cells LLC), building gigafactories in Lordstown, Ohio, and Spring Hill, Tennessee, with plenty of further capacity planned. This ensures supply stability and cost control in a market where battery scarcity and commodity volatility remain major constraints.

Autonomous efforts have required a massive strategic shift. After facing disappointing delays, safety concerns, and mixed public sentiment, GM is narrowing its AV ambitions. Cruise will now focus on personal vehicle autonomy, integrating GM's Super Cruise and Ultra Cruise driver-assist systems with enhanced AI and sensor fusion technologies. These efforts benefit from a high-profile partnership with Nvidia, designed to embed AI into everything from driver assistance to production robotics and supply chain logistics.

Notably, GM spent a whopping $9.2 billion on research and development in 2024 alone, reflecting a profound, multi-year commitment to transformation. This capital expenditure extends far beyond cars, it supports high-margin digital services, advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), battery R&D, and over-the-air (OTA) software capabilities.

III. Financial State of the Union: Strength Meets Skepticism

General Motors' financials paint the picture of a mature, cash-generative business in the throes of disruptive reinvention. With a market cap of $47.76 billion, it remains among the most financially resilient automakers in the world. Its forward dividend yield stands at 1.21%, reflecting a modest $0.60 annual payout that leaves ample capital for further reinvestment.

Strong profitability and a forward EPS growth projection of 7.71% point to operational excellence. With $23 billion in operating cash flow and healthy EBITDA margins, the company is able to self-fund much of its electrification roadmap without resorting to dilutive share issuance or excessive leverage.

However, this strength is tempered by sluggish growth metrics. Forward revenue growth is forecast at just 2%, lagging even the modest sector average of 3%. Moreover, GM has seen 22 downward earnings revisions in just three months, with analysts citing cost inflation, EV margin pressures, and underperformance in China.

Yet despite these revisions, the stock has rallied more than 50% in the past year, outpacing a 5% decline across the broader auto sector. This performance divergence suggests that market participants may be pricing in longer-term recovery or simply reacting to near-term momentum. Regardless, it flags the importance of investor discernment: is this a turnaround story gaining traction, or a value trap in disguise?

GM's financial resilience is a core part of the investment thesis, and a closer look at its balance sheet, especially in comparison to key rivals, reveals a more nuanced and compelling story. While the industry is heavily reliant on captive finance arms, the structure of that debt is a major differentiator.

A crucial point of distinction between GM and a primary competitor like Ford lies in their debt management. GM has been notably more prudent, carrying less overall debt and, critically, structuring it with longer-term maturities. This is particularly relevant for their respective financial arms, GM Financial and Ford Motor Credit. While both generate substantial, high-margin revenue, Ford has historically relied more on short-term debt, including asset-backed securities similar to those used before the 2008 financial crisis. This exposes Ford to significant rollover risk should credit markets tighten. In contrast, GM's more conservatively structured debt, with maturities spaced out more favourably, suggests its earnings are of higher quality and more resilient to macroeconomic shocks.

This financial discipline is coupled with a distinct market position in terms of average selling price (ASP). When you look at the raw numbers, GM's revenue per vehicle in 2023 was approximately $28,200, which is lower than Ford's $40,000, and Stellantis's $32,100. While these numbers aren't a perfect like-for-like comparison due to global operations (Ford's European business, for example, can drag down its average), they paint a clear picture of GM's positioning.

When you factor in the U.S. market specifically, it's highly likely that GM, on average, sells the most affordable vehicles. This is a significant competitive advantage. The ability to profitably sell cars at lower price points speaks to immense operational efficiency and scale. This positioning allows GM to capture a wider swath of the market, including the crucial entry-level segment. Historically, companies that can dominate the lower-priced, high-volume segments are the ones that endure, while those overly dependent on premium vehicles can be more susceptible to economic downturns. This is a powerful argument for GM's long-term sustainability and a core reason why investor pessimism may be excessive.

IV. Valuation Narrative: P/E, DCF, and the Margin of Safety

General Motors' valuation remains one of the most compelling aspects of its investment thesis. A forward P/E ratio of 5.36 is deeply discounted relative to sector norms. Even adjusting for cyclicality, capital expenditure, and EV transition risk, this multiple implies that the market is either bracing for a sharp earnings drop or massively undervaluing GM's longer-term cash flows.

Basic DCF analyses assign a fair value of $81.06 to GM's stock, suggesting a 40% undervaluation relative to its current trading price. The DCF model assumes a gradual decline in FCF from $9.09 billion in 2025 to $7.59 billion by 2034 and applies a discount rate of 12%, reflecting a beta of 2.0 (twice the market's volatility). Terminal growth is set at 2.9%, aligning with long-term government bond yields.

While these assumptions are largely conservative, they nonetheless highlight a significant margin of safety. The contrast between DCF and analyst consensus (with a median target of $53.82) reflects a fairly sizeable philosophical divide: near-term earnings visibility versus long-term cash flow potential. For disciplined value investors, such dislocations are absolute goldmines, but only if one is willing to wait.

V. The Competitive Chessboard: Titans, Upstarts, and the EV Arms Race

As always, the global auto industry is in flux. GM competes with legacy giants like Ford, Toyota, and Volkswagen, as well as relative insurgents like Tesla, Rivian, and VinFast. While these established players race to electrify their lineups, new entrants are unencumbered by legacy operations or labor structures, allowing them to innovate and iterate faster.

Tesla, with its outsized market cap and software-driven margins, remains the benchmark. GM's response is to leverage its scale, brand equity, and vertically integrated model to reduce costs, speed up development cycles, and offer EVs across multiple price points. Its dealer network, numbering in the thousands, provides logistical and after-sales reach that most EV-only rivals lack.

Moreover, GM's foray into software-based revenue is a game-changer. Through its Software & Services business unit, the company aims to monetize connectivity, subscriptions, and data analytics. If successful, these high-margin revenue streams could significantly boost GM's valuation multiples, which are currently anchored to traditional manufacturing metrics.

To more clearly define GM's investment strategy, it is essential to quantify its commitment to electrification and understand its performance in the critical Chinese market in concrete numbers.

GM has aggressively committed to its EV and autonomous vehicle (AV) future, with a significant financial outlay. The company increased its planned investments from 2020 through 2025 to a total of $35 billion, a 75% increase from its initial commitment. This capital is being used to build out its Ultium battery platform, retool factories, and develop AV technology.

By the end of 2025, the company aims to have the capacity to produce more than 1 million electric vehicles annually in North America. This is a major strategic push, backed by the construction of new battery cell plants and the conversion of existing facilities like the Orion Assembly plant to produce electric trucks.

The Chinese automotive market presents a complex picture for General Motors. While the article notes declining market share, it's important to look at the total unit volume and the growth within the EV segment.

GM and its joint ventures in China experienced a sales surge in the first half of 2025, with deliveries exceeding 890,000 units, marking a 9.4% increase from the previous year. This included a particularly strong second quarter with over 447,000 units sold, a 20% year-over-year increase. This suggests that while market share has faced headwinds, GM's unit volumes are not in a state of absolute decline but are instead recovering from previous pressures.

The electric vehicle market in China is the largest in the world and continues to expand rapidly. In 2024, nearly half of China's car sales were electric, with the country's EV sales surpassing 11 million units. GM is actively participating in this trend, and its new energy vehicle (NEV) sales in China are a key driver of its recent recovery. In the second quarter of 2025, GM's NEV sales in China soared by 50% year-over-year. This growth is a crucial indicator that GM's strategy of focusing on local brands like Wuling and Baojun, along with its broader NEV portfolio, is beginning to gain traction. The success of vehicles like the Wuling Hong Guang MINIEV, which remains GM's top-selling NEV nameplate in the country, underscores its ability to compete in this dynamic and fiercely competitive market.

VI. Risks and Red Flags: From Shanghai to Silicon Valley

However, China poses an existential challenge. Once GM's most profitable international market, it is now a major flashpoint for losses. Domestic competitors like BYD and Nio are now clearly winning on price, innovation, and government support. Regulatory hurdles for emissions, local content requirements, and tariff risks only compound the problem. A turnaround here is not just optional, it's absolutely essential.

Domestically, rising production costs, supply chain disruptions, and interest rate sensitivity create headwinds. Semiconductor shortages, though easing, still constrain certain models and trim levels. Add to this the risk of a U.S. economic slowdown, and GM's near-term outlook becomes clouded.

The EV transition itself is a capital-intensive high-wire act. The industry's so-called ""valley of death"" describes the liminal space where legacy ICE profits are waning, but EV volumes have not yet reached scale. GM must navigate this phase with precision, lest it suffer the fate of other potentially over-leveraged legacy players.

VII. Investment Outlook: A Marathon, Not a Drag Race

To me, General Motors offers a quintessential value investing puzzle: solid fundamentals, pessimistic consensus, and deep optionality embedded in future innovation. Its market price reflects doubt. Its financials reflect strength. For long-term investors, this dissonance could represent opportunity.

The Hold rating I've landed on is not a condemnation, it's a call for patience. The EV-AV transition is unfolding over years, not quarters. While GM may lack immediate catalysts, its long-term roadmap is coherent, funded, and strategically sound.

Key catalysts that could prompt a re-rating include:

Recovery in Chinese market share

Acceleration in EV margin expansion

Commercialization of autonomous driving technologies

Material growth in software and services revenue

Positive earnings surprises and analyst upgrades

So in conclusion, GM is not for the faint of heart. But for those with a high risk tolerance and a long-term horizon, it may prove one of the most underappreciated industrial turnarounds of this decade.

That’s what Netherlands native Sharon Cornelissen did a decade ago as part of an experiment for her college dissertation, as well as for her upcoming book, “The Last House on the Block.”

The book, which comes out next month, takes a look at failed gentrification in the northwest Detroit neighborhood, such as white residents buying foreclosed homes for cheap prices and taking vacant land and converting it into urban gardens.

However, the area is still struggling to gain population years later. Since 1970, Brightmoor’s population declined from 26,040 to 9,372 residents in 2017, a 64% population loss – and shifted from all-white to 83% Black, Cornelissen wrote in a 2021 report.

Cornelissen is a sociologist and national housing expert who now lives in Washington DC. She serves as the director of housing for nonprofit the Consumer Federation of America, where she advocates on behalf of American consumers for fair, affordable housing and equitable mortgage lending. Prior to joining the CFA, she worked as a postdoctoral fellow at the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies, where she published research briefs and advocated to address contemporary housing discrimination in Massachusetts. While earning her PhD in sociology from Princeton University, Cornelissen embedded herself in the Brightmoor community to experience the challenges of being a homeowner in the city when she bought a house for $7,000.

In her new book, Cornelissen takes readers into the world of her Brightmoor neighbors, whom she lived with from July 2015 to August 2018. She reveals their struggles to keep their homes while keeping violence, tall grass and gentrification at bay. White residents in Brightmoor are also part of the story, where readers learn about their real estate bargains, urban farms and how they became the unlikely defenders of urban desolation.

Cornelissen is going on a national book tour to promote “The Last House on the Block,” including two stops in Detroit. On Nov. 6, she’ll be at Detroit Rosa coffee shop in Grandmont Rosedale from 7-8 p.m. for a talk with Belle Isle Conservancy CEO Meagan Elliott. The event is in collaboration with bookshop 27th Letter Books. On Nov. 10, Cornelissen will be joined by BridgeDetroit reporter Malachi Barrett for a conversation from 6-7 p.m. at Source Booksellers in Midtown.

While the official release date is Nov. 19 through the University of Chicago Press, Source, 27th Letter, and Literati Bookstore in Ann Arbor will be selling copies of Cornelissen’s book ahead of and during the upcoming talks.

I spoke with Corneliseen about how she became interested in ethnography (a branch of anthropology where data is collected through observations and interviews to determine how societies and individuals function), why she chose to live in Brightmoor and her experience owning a home in Detroit.

BridgeDetroit: When did you become interested in ethnography and sociology?

Cornelissen: I was still living in the Netherlands at the time and that’s where I read some of my first ethnographic books. One is called “Body and Soul” (by French sociologist Loïc Wacquant), which is about men on Chicago’s south side becoming boxers. It was just so rich and impressive to me that I was like, “I would like to be an ethnographer.” That’s how I ended up at Princeton. This book started as a dissertation when I was at Princeton. I was living in Brooklyn at the time and when I was thinking of what to write about, Detroit was in the news a lot because of the bankruptcy. It portrayed a lot of the city as very empty and sort of abandoned. I thought, “Well, there’s a lot more to this story, right?” And that’s how I started that project.

BridgeDetroit: There are more than 200 neighborhoods in Detroit. What made you choose Brightmoor to live and study in?

Cornelissen: When I moved to Detroit, I was staying with some friends in Midtown because I didn’t really know enough about the city to understand where I’d want to live. But Brightmoor was on my radar because I knew that there was a lot of community organizing happening there, so I thought that would make it easier for me to meet people.

I actually ended up in Brightmoor with the unlikely help of the Dutch diaspora. I was just going everywhere I could, going to the Detroit Eviction Defense, going to city meetings, going to different neighborhoods. One Friday, I went to Brightmoor to the very first farmers market. There were only 20, 30 people there. And one of the first people I talked to said, “Oh, you’re Dutch. Have you met the other Dutch person in the neighborhood?” That’s how I met Riet Schumack, a well-known community organizer in Detroit. We’re both from the south in the Netherlands, so she quickly offered me a place to stay (at her home).

BridgeDetroit: What was it like living with Riet and her husband Mark for that first year in Brightmoor?

Cornelissen: It was such a new experience for me. I mean, before that, I was living in Brooklyn in a tiny apartment in South Williamsburg. It was very vibrant, but also I didn’t really know any of my neighbors. Moving into Brightmoor, it was just such a different world. I would walk down the block and people would look out for me or say hi. It’s almost like you live in a small town rather than a city. It was just great living with Riet and Mark. We would have breakfast together, dinners together. I learned a lot about the political situation in Detroit and the mayor. Ethnography is really putting yourself into situations to learn and that’s what that was.

BridgeDetroit: What are some things you learned about homeownership in Detroit when you bought a house in Brightmoor?

Cornelissen: I never set out to be a homeowner in Detroit, but after a year of living with Riet and Mark, I wanted to find a place on my own. When I started looking into it, I realized that, especially at the time (in 2016), renting could be more expensive than owning a home. When I started looking for homes, one thing I learned is that most Detroit homes are not move-in ready, especially Brightmoor. They take a lot of work, and the cost of that work is often more than what the house is worth. It’s nice to have your own front porch, but it also comes with a lot of responsibility. The houses in Detroit are always slowly falling apart, so there’s always something new that you have to take care of. That was a big lesson for me. My front door fell on me one day, like it just fell down. I had a leaking roof one winter. There’s just a lot of maintenance that is ongoing, and that’s very expensive for people to keep their house together.

I also learned that it was–and I write about this in the book at the end–it was very difficult to sell the house. I wanted to sell it to a Detroiter, I didn’t want to sell it to an investor. For most Detroiters, it’s really difficult to qualify for a mortgage, especially when the mortgage is less than $10,000. Most lenders don’t want to do mortgages that small. It was really difficult to find someone that could either get a mortgage or bring cash, but also would be a homeowner that would want to live in a house. It took me a long time to sell the house and to find the right family. I didn’t want another empty house, or just a speculator that’s sitting on the house and hoping that it will be worth more one day, and doing nothing with the house. I wanted there to be another neighbor for my neighbors.

BridgeDetroit: What was the rest of your time like in Detroit? Did you enjoy living in the city?

Cornelissen: It was great! There’s so many characters in Brightmoor, so many personalities, so many stories that people come with. And it energized me to be able to learn from Detroiters and meet them in all these different spaces like church, the soup kitchen, a blight cleanup or when they’re mowing the grass. It was very rich to learn and connect with people. I think my world became much bigger and I think they (residents) enjoyed hanging out with me because I brought this weird, Dutch perspective. I also think that Brightmoor is a very hopeful place. I tried to write my book from a perspective of hope. A lot of people that are still there, they are united by a hope for the future of their neighborhood. They know that it can turn around and it can be better, and they’re willing to stick it out for it. That’s a positive mindset to be around. I really appreciated that.

As always, have a great week!

Until next time,

Micah

In a letter published Tuesday ahead of next week's COP30 U.N. climate summit, Gates argued that too many resources are focused on emissions and the environment, and that more money should go toward ""improving lives"" and curbing disease and poverty.

""... Climate is super important but has to be considered in terms of overall human welfare,"" Gates told CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin in an exclusive interview. ""I didn't pick that position because everybody agrees with it – it's I think intellectually the right answer.""

In the letter, Gates called out the ""doomsday view"" of climate change and said leaders need to make a ""strategic pivot"" to focus on issues that have the ""greatest impact on human welfare.""

""It's the best way to ensure that everyone gets a chance to live a healthy and productive life no matter where they're born, and no matter what kind of climate they're born into,"" he wrote.

Breakthrough Energy, Gates' climate-focused investment fund, reportedly cut dozens of staffers earlier this year. The New York Times reported in March that the ""change shows how Mr. Gates is retooling his empire for the Trump era.""

This year's climate summit in Brazil comes nearly a decade after world leaders adopted the Paris Climate Agreement aimed at limiting temperature warming to 1.5 degree Celsius above pre-industrial levels.

Gates called that original goal unrealistic.

Over the last decade, the U.S. government has stepped in and out of the commitment depending on who's in the White House.

The U.S. initially entered the agreement under President Barack Obama, before President Donald Trump pulled out of the pact when he took office for a first time in 2017. After President Joe Biden rejoined, Trump issued an executive order to again withdraw during his second term.

Gates said in 2017 that he was ""deeply concerned"" but ""hopeful"" that the U.S. would continue supporting innovation after Trump left the agreement.

Gates told Sorkin that pulling back on climate initiatives is a ""huge disappointment,"" but credited companies like Microsoft for investing in alternative energy technologies. Continued support of these innovations will bring down costs, he said.

Over the last decade, several major technology companies, including Meta , Alphabet and Microsoft have set 2030 targets to reach net-zero emissions or go carbon negative.

In February, Microsoft sustainability chief Melanie Nakagawa admitted that the ""moon has gotten further away"" from previous goals as the company doubles down on artificial intelligence.

""However, the force creating this distance from our goals in the short term is the same one that will help us build a bigger, faster, and more powerful rocket to reach them in the long term: artificial intelligence (AI),"" she wrote.

The massive energy demand needed to meet growing data center power requirements has sparked concerns among many climate activists.

In terms of AI and concerns that a bubble has formed, Gates said many investments will be ""dead ends.""

Still, he added, ""If you want to be a tech company you don't get to say no let's check out of this race.""",https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108194846-17570782952025-09-05t001447z_1374391004_rc2blgak2e5j_rtrmadp_0_usa-trump.jpeg?v=1757078334&w=1920&h=1080,N,,2025-10-28 08:01:59.985401

BluWave-ai and Electricity Maps announced today a strategic partnership to eliminate data fragmentation and drive global decarbonization efforts across electric vehicle (EV) charging and energy storage optimization.

The partnership enables the suite of artificial intelligence software products from BluWave-ai, including EV Everywhere™ and Energy Storage Autopilot™, to scale deployment rapidly across new international markets by leveraging the standardized, high-resolution, and global grid data from Electricity Maps. BluWave-ai, as a pioneer in AI-driven energy optimization, has deep expertise backed by an intellectual property portfolio currently including 49 patent filings covering AI-based renewable energy and electric vehicle optimization.

From Fragmented Data to Optimized Action.

Across all electricity-intensive industries, companies face a major hurdle in acquiring and standardizing grid data which are inherently different at each utility. While integrating with a single grid is manageable, expanding solutions globally requires immense data preparation due to the vast array of incompatible formats and varying data maturities of grid operators worldwide. For global operators like BluWave-ai, which manage pools of distributed energy resources (DERs), storage and EV fleets across multiple regions, this complexity slowed down time to market and commissioning of AI products.

The need for a scalable, automated solution to manage this load intelligently is urgent with over 85 million EVs on the roads by the end of 2025. This will consume approximately 5.7 TWh of electricity per week, a demand comparable to approximately 143 large data centers over a week.

“By integrating the standardized API from Electricity Maps which provides access to real-time and historical grid signals across over 190 countries and zones, our AI models can adapt seamlessly without custom data preparation for each new market,” said Thomas Triplet, VP of Technology at BluWave-ai, “Our patented AI predictors and optimizers intake features from diverse data streams in a manner best suited to trigger high performance AI and generate our patent pending BluScore™ to forecast grid health in real-time. To enable fast time to operations, our team at BluWave-ai has built an interface to ingest from Electricity Maps activate our AI modes both for inference and continuous training. By setting up this system we have taken operationalization spanning multiple utilities from what could be multiple days or weeks to sub 1 hour.”

Real-Time Decarbonization and Optimization

The BluWave-ai software platform utilizes the data from Electricity Maps – including real-time grid signals for carbon intensity, power mix, and price information – to optimize customer operations, maximizing renewable energy utilization and lowering emissions globally.

Electricity Maps provides BluWave-ai with validated, standardized real-time data on grid carbon intensity and price signals, effectively acting as the crucial input layer. BluWave-ai’s patented AI platform then executes complex, multi-variable optimization.

Specifically, the integration enhances BluWave-ai’s product lines by allowing them to:

Dynamically calculating and scheduling energy assets (e.g., EVs, battery energy storage, and data centers) to maximize cost savings and minimize carbon intensity in real-time, a process that is unique to BluWave-ai’s proprietary algorithms.

Creating a federated, virtual power plant capable of operating across diverse global markets without the costly, time-consuming effort of manual, one-off grid integrations.

“A big hurdle to deploying AI-driven optimization globally is data fragmentation. Grid data is messy, inconsistent, and often requires bespoke integration for every single geography to work consistently with AI models that require standardized input features,” said Devashish Paul, CEO and Founder of BluWave-ai. “With a European EV fleet projected to exceed 12 million and spread across dozens of distinct national power systems, the challenge of standardizing grid integration to manage this massive new load is paramount. This partnership with Electricity Maps provides the standardized, high-resolution foundation our AI platform needs to operate seamlessly across countries and electricity systems, dramatically reducing time to operationalize and revenue from customers.”

“Our mission is to empower everyone, from developers to global enterprise platforms, to build a truly sustainable future by providing transparent, actionable electricity data,” said Olivier Corradi, CEO of Electricity Maps. “By integrating our standardized, real-time grid signals, BluWave-ai’s Energy Storage Autopilot and EV Everywhere platforms can make the most optimal decisions, ensuring that every charge and discharge cycle maximizes clean energy use and minimizes carbon emissions worldwide.”

BluWave-ai product information can be obtained from info@BluWave-ai.com for utilities interested in deploying EV Everywhere™ and system operators or IPPs with storage projects interested in Energy Storage Autopilot™

After that bipartisan goal was made in 2008, the fossil fuel lobby and global forces shifted state energy policy against the renewable market.

Ohio’s energy users only get 4% of their energy from renewable sources, putting it 44th in the country.
Rader is supporting a Republican-backed effort to introduce more community renewable energy projects in Ohio.","Editor's note: This is part two of the three-part ""State of Energy"" series from WOSU. Read part one: '25% generation by 2025': Where did Ohio’s Clean Energy Law go?

The air quality in Ohio is getting worse.

Brittany Sinzinger has been the executive director for the American Lung Association of Columbus for 13 years.

“If you look at our newest report, the 26th annual ""State of Air"" report that came out, it is showing that about 50% of the population is breathing air that is not good for them,"" Sinzinger said.

Several Ohio metro areas made the lung association’s top 25 list for worst year-round particle pollution, including Cincinnati, Cleveland and Akron.

The lung association ranks the air quality in Columbus as an overall “C,” but it gets an “F” for particle pollution.

Sinzinger said there’s a reason these particles and the human body shouldn’t mix.

“They are various sizes, so there are teeny, teeny, tiny ones and then there are some that are larger and when we inhale those, the larger ones, our bodies are made to expel those so we cough or we sneeze, but there's tiny, tiny little particles that can wedge themselves down into our lungs and get into that tissue and that can be very dangerous for people,"" Sinzinger said.

Particle pollution has a bigger impact on the human body than other types of pollution like ozone. It's the most dangerous type of air pollution to human health, according to the lung association. The pollution can cause lung cancer, asthma, heart attack, stroke and can impair cognitive function.

As previously written in part one of this series on Monday, Ohio was supposed to generate 25% percent of its energy with renewable sources by 2025. It’s 2025, and the state has only reached a fifth of that goal.

After that bipartisan goal was made in 2008, the fossil fuel lobby and global forces shifted state energy policy against the renewable market. Experts report the move hurt a once-growing industry in Ohio, and damaged public health and the environment.

Some industries create more particle pollution than others.

Sinzinger said factories, power plants, manufacturing, vehicles powered by diesel and gasoline and anything that burns raw materials on a large scale create the large particles that are bad for human health.

These bad particles can blow in from production centers elsewhere and can get trapped because of geological features of the land.

Ohio's electric power sector is one of the state’s most emissive because of how much coal is still in the mix, and coal power plants are a top producer of particulate pollution, according to the National Institute of Health. Researchers there found a direct correlation between burning coal and increased mortality rates.

Ohio House Rep. Tristan Rader, Parma-D, said fossil fuel companies have had a stranglehold over Ohio’s politicians, on both sides of the aisle.

“I think it's just total utility capture,"" Rader said. ""Total utility regulatory capture and then their ability to just throw enough money around to always get politicians on their side to get done whatever they need to get done until whatever they don't like.”

Rader said energy companies have been too cozy with lawmakers in the past.

“I look at it as just way too much money influence with the utilities here in Ohio,"" Rader said.

Ohio’s energy users only get 4% of their energy from renewable sources, putting it 44th in the country.

Renewable sources produce less particle emissions and have less energy loss.

Jeff Bielicki is the research lead at Ohio State University’s Sustainability Institute. He said the state hasn’t balanced the environmental and health concerns with the economics of its energy policies, but has only focused on the ability of utility companies to make a profit.

“We need to consider the air that we breathe, the water that we drink, and so on, and how that sustains our well-being. The environment is an important component of our well being. The economy is also an important component of well being, the ability to make money, have a job, is an important component of well being too,"" Bielicki said.

Bielicki warns that climate change is also putting more demand on our energy usage.

“It's clear that temperatures are getting hotter on average over time, which leads to more demand for cooling, air conditioning, for example, and all else equal less demand for heating. Because temperatures are warmer. And that, in essence, shifts the demand profile from heating,"" Bielicki said.

Energy sources like natural gas are easily converted into heat, but more resources are needed to create electricity to power cooling systems.

Restrictions on the renewable energy industry in some states have prevented the generation of much needed electricity by alternative sources, prompting states like Pennsylvania to delay closing coal power plants.

Demands on the power grid are growing, and Ohio lawmakers say they’re now embracing all energy sources.

“I think there's this new willingness to push back the utilities that have gone way too far for way too long, and we need to make sure that we represent the people that live in our districts, (and) that deserve protection and deserve monopolies be held accountable,” Rader said.

Rader is supporting a Republican-backed effort to introduce more community renewable energy projects in Ohio.

“The economics of these projects being kind of efficient, not having to rely on the transmission grid, or not having you bid into this giant system, there's a little bit of savings that folks can get,"" Rader said.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/18a6f82/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4624x2428+0+522/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F27%2F88%2F7887059546f7b6cece9a43faadfb%2Futility-lines.jpg,N,,2025-10-28 12:05:54.765567

In the memo, Mr. Gates did not announce a change in strategy for funding climate ventures.","Bill Gates, the Microsoft co-founder who has spent billions of his own money to raise the alarm about the dangers of climate change, is now pushing back against what he calls a “doomsday outlook” and appears to have shifted his stance on the risks posed by a warming planet.

In a lengthy memo released Tuesday, Mr. Gates sought to tamp down the alarmism he said many people use to describe the effects of rising temperatures. Instead, he called for redirecting efforts toward improving lives in the developing world.

“Although climate change will have serious consequences — particularly for people in the poorest countries — it will not lead to humanity’s demise,” he wrote. “People will be able to live and thrive in most places on Earth for the foreseeable future.”

Coming just four years after he published a book titled “How to Avoid a Climate Disaster,” Tuesday’s memo appears to amount to a major reframing of how Mr. Gates, who is worth an estimated $122 billion, is thinking about the challenges posed by a rapidly warming world.

It arrives a week before world leaders gather in Belém, Brazil, for the United Nations annual climate summit, known this year as COP30. Mr. Gates, who turned 70 on Tuesday and has attended the event in previous years, will not be participating. He declined to comment about his memo.

Over the past decade, Mr. Gates has spent large sums of his personal fortune pushing for policies that would reduce the greenhouse gases that are dangerously heating the planet. He has invested in companies working on clean energy and efforts to help poor communities adapt to rising seas, more extreme heat, fires and drought and intensifying storms and floods.

In 2015, Mr. Gates founded Breakthrough Energy, a venture fund to back promising new clean energy start-ups. It grew to include a climate policy group in Washington to promote ways to cut emissions.

“Climate change is already affecting most people’s lives, and when we think about the impact on our families and future generations, it can feel overwhelming,” he wrote in an essay in 2023 that was published on the website of Breakthrough Energy and has since been taken down. “The scale and speed of the transformation required to build a clean energy future is unprecedented.”

In March, Breakthrough Energy announced deep cuts that included dismantling its climate policy group.

And in May, Mr. Gates announced plans to wind down the Gates Foundation, which has spent billions on climate-related issues, including a $1.4 billion commitment to help farmers in poor countries adapt to a hotter planet.

As the Trump administration has slashed foreign aid budgets and shuttered the U.S. Agency for International Development, Mr. Gates has redirected much of his charitable giving to fill the void left by the U.S. government and focus on health and poverty in the developing world.

“He saw the U.S.A.I.D. situation as more pressing, and something where he could be more effective,” said Johannes Ackva, who leads climate work at Founders Pledge, an organization that advises philanthropists.

Mr. Gates continues to invest in clean energy start-ups through groups including the Breakthrough Energy Catalyst program, Breakthrough Energy Ventures and the Breakthrough Energy Fellows. In the memo, Mr. Gates did not announce a change in strategy for funding climate ventures.

He also continues to fund in nuclear energy. Last week, TerraPower, a nuclear company he backs, secured crucial federal approval as it works to bring a new typed of reactor to market.

But the memo also sought to redirect efforts away from the campaign to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and instead focus on other ways to improve human lives and reduce suffering.

While he called climate change “a very important problem” that needs to be solved, he said that “the doomsday outlook is causing much of the climate community to focus too much on near-term emissions goals.” And that was “diverting resources from the most effective things we should be doing to improve life in a warming world,” he wrote.

The world is warming faster than at any point in recorded history. Last year was the hottest on record. Scientists warn that unless countries make a rapid shift away from burning fossil fuels, the planet is likely to experience extreme weather and other changes faster than humans can adapt. Low-lying island nations are already seeing their land disappearing under rising seas caused by melting glaciers and polar ice sheets. An estimated 62,775 people died from heat in Europe last year.

Mr. Gates sought to shift attention away from the focus on temperatures, however, writing in the memo that “temperature is not the best way to measure our progress on climate.”

David Callahan, the editor of Inside Philanthropy, said Mr. Gates could be trying to reposition the debate around climate change during a highly political moment when Republicans are overtly hostile toward efforts to address the issue.

“One could imagine this being a continuation of wanting to move to the center and not wanting to be a target of the Trump administration,” Mr. Callahan said.

Politics aside, Mr. Callahan said Mr. Gates’s change in messaging was in line with studies that have shown that alarmist rhetoric about climate change is not the most effective way to motivate people to take action. “The result of a lot of research is that it’s much better to lean into the optimism than the pessimism,” Mr. Callahan said.

Many scientists believe that the planet’s rapid warming could bring about a series of irreversible tipping points that could have cascading impacts. These scenarios include changes to ocean currents, the disappearance of ice sheets and the mass death of coral reefs.

Mr. Gates did not address any of those scenarios in the new memo, though he has discussed them before.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/28/multimedia/28cli-gates-01-czbk/28cli-gates-01-czbk-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-10-28 08:19:45.605581

Founded in 2017 by Tesla co-founder and former CTO JB Straubel, Nevada-based Redwood provides energy storage at scale, and produces critical battery materials such as lithium, nickel, cobalt and copper, in order to help build one of the largest domestic sources of these materials. The company’s two key business lines include grid energy storage, in which it designs, integrates, and deploys large-scale low-cost storage systems using new and repurposed batteries, and critical materials, which involves recycling batteries at end-of-life, refining their critical minerals, and manufacturing critical materials for the U.S. supply chain. Redwood’s technology combines materials and manufacturing expertise with advanced power electronics and software, creating U.S.-made energy storage systems that reduce dependence on imported batteries.

According to Redwood, the new financing comes in an environment of intense domestic demand growth for critical materials and energy products combined with curtailment in international supplies, while electric energy availability has become a key strategic issue for AI infrastructure growth, and energy storage capacity is needed to help address the intermittency of domestic renewable generation and support industrial electrification.

With new investment, Redwood plans to expand its energy storage deployments, materials refining operations and engineering teams, helping to strengthen American energy leadership and critical mineral independence.

The funding round was led by Eclipse, with new investment from NVentures, the venture capital arm of NVIDIA, alongside other strategic backers.

In July, Redwood announced a new agreement with General Motors aimed at accelerating the deployment of energy storage systems based on both second-life battery packs and new batteries produced by General Motors.

21m good green jobs now exist in the 81 cities assessed across all sectors of the economy, with the highest numbers of green jobs in waste management, construction, transport, and energy

London, UK (28 October 2025) – New data released today shows C40 cities are now home to 21 million good, green jobs, putting C40 mayors firmly on track to deliver their target of driving the creation of 50 million such jobs by 2030.

The latest milestone, announced ahead of the 2025 C40 World Mayors Summit in Rio de Janeiro next week, shows how city-led climate action is not only cutting emissions but driving inclusive economic growth and improving lives.

C40 Cities, a group of nearly 100 of the world’s largest cities united in tackling the climate crisis in a just and equitable way. Those living and working in C40 cities – over 900 million people – account for almost half of global GDP. From transforming homes, schools, and workplaces so they’re energy-efficient, to delivering state-of-the-art clean public transport systems that improve the air we breathe, and making neighbourhoods more resilient to the worst impacts of climate change, mayors are already using their powers to create green jobs and make these opportunities accessible for all.

C40 defines good green jobs as jobs that help reduce greenhouse gas emissions, protect nature and improve well-being. They provide fair wages, safe working conditions, and stable employment. This shows how addressing the climate crisis can improve lives, create opportunities and deliver on people’s immediate needs.

The commitment to deliver 50 million good green jobs was first made at the 2022 C40 World Mayors Summit in Buenos Aires. This 2025 update is being released as mayors prepare to meet again in Rio de Janeiro, this time against the backdrop of record-breaking heat, escalating climate impacts and a shifting geopolitical landscape.

Despite these challenges, mayors from C40 cities have driven forward climate action that is contributing to:

Create over 13.5 million direct green jobs, including roles in renewable energy, clean construction, and sustainable transport.

Sustain 7.6 million indirect green jobs in supply chains supporting the green economy.

Deliver tangible benefits to local residents, particularly in sectors where cities hold the most power to act, including waste management, transportation, construction and energy.

C40 mayors continue to demonstrate that urban climate action creates more jobs than business-as-usual approaches, and continued investing in workforce development programmes makes these opportunities accessible for all.

Mayor of London and Co-Chair of C40 Cities, Sadiq Khan, said: “Helping to create good, well-paid green jobs is one of the most powerful things we can do to build a fairer, greener and more resilient future. I’m proud that C40 cities are turning ambition into action, proving that climate leadership at the city level delivers real results, especially for our most vulnerable communities.

“As we look ahead to COP30, we must build on this momentum. Cities are leading the way, but we can’t do it alone. We need national governments and financial institutions to step up in the same way cities have and invest in the skills and jobs that will help to power a sustainable transition for all.”

Today’s new report, ‘Global Good Green Jobs in C40 Cities’, developed by C40 Cities in partnership with Circle Economy, tracks green employment across 81 global megacities. The findings confirm that city-led climate action is contributing to increased economic opportunities by creating jobs for residents. More than 10% of all employment in these cities is now green, with mayors accelerating investments in:

Waste management: 80% of jobs in the sector are now green as cities achieve universal waste collection and reduce the amount of waste going to landfill.

Transport: 32% green jobs, driven by public transit expansion and electrification.

Construction: 22% green jobs, fuelled by building decarbonisation.

Energy: 28% green jobs, reflecting rapid shifts to clean power.

Green jobs are also growing faster than total employment, demonstrating the economic dividends of ambitious city action. Importantly, approximately 80% of total jobs are not currently ‘green’, but have the potential to become green jobs in the future as different industries undergo electrification, powering their operations with renewable energy, reducing waste, or other sustainable practices.

Mayor of São Paulo, Ricardo Nunes said: “The City of São Paulo has recently been recognized as a global reference in green job creation and the implementation of innovative environmental policies. This is an area that motivates us and to which the City Hall of São Paulo devotes significant efforts.

“A prominent example is Sampa+Rural, the largest urban agriculture program in Brazil, which successfully integrates agriculture, healthy food, and ecotourism, while also supporting local livelihoods. Launched in 2022, the programme has already identified and fostered more than 4,100 initiatives related to agriculture, ecotourism, and healthy food systems in the city.”

Mark Watts, Executive Director of C40 Cities said: “This is exactly the kind of leadership the world needs right now.

“While others talk, mayors are delivering tangible, measurable progress that builds a fairer, greener future. Cities are at the centre of driving a just transition, and these jobs are proof that climate action benefits people and local economies.”

Ivonne Bojoh, CEO of Circle Economy said: “It’s wonderful to see the scope of the green jobs study expand to include more cities globally, particularly those in India.

“There is still more work to be done to accelerate the transition across sectors and boost employment, not only in the core areas of the green economy, such as repair, waste infrastructure and management, sustainable energy, and public transport, but also in the supporting sectors that uphold them.

“In future iterations of this important global report, I hope to see more cities engage with this initiative and share their employment data. I also look forward to more public–private initiatives that drive good, green jobs, supported by financial institutions enabling innovative and pioneering entrepreneurs to build green businesses, and by education systems preparing the next generations for a regenerative economy.”

However, the data also underscores gender and equity gaps that are still being addressed: men currently hold around 60% of green jobs globally, with women concentrated in the healthcare and education sectors, for example, which are essential for the green economy, though often under-recognised. The distribution of jobs amongst young workers reflects the same structural gender divide. Informal workers, who make up more than 60% of employment globally, are also essential in the green transition and it is key to ensure that they have decent working conditions. Addressing these gaps and also expanding opportunities for young people will be critical to realising the full economic and social potential of the green transition.

There are already many examples of cities already building equity into their drive towards green jobs including London training 6,500 workers through the city’s Green Skills Academy, Freetown’s creating more than 1,000 green jobs through the “Treetown” urban reforestation initiative, scaling up solar energy installation in informal settlements in Rio de Janeiro, empowering informal workers in Quezon City to improve their protections and working conditions and expand their roles in green sectors, and preparing the workforce to meet the demand for jobs in the rapid transition to electric transportation in Philadelphia.

Mayor Joy Belmonte of Quezon City said: “Quezon City is determined to build a greener and more inclusive economy where no one is left behind.

“Through our Executive Order on Good Green Jobs and our ordinance on the informal economy, we are embedding fairness and opportunity into climate action, ensuring that decent, green livelihoods are accessible to marginalized populations, especially informal workers.

“By combining bold policy with strong data systems, we are proud to partner with C40 in charting progress towards a future where climate ambition creates dignity, equity, and resilience for all.”

Brian Motherway, Head of the Office of Energy Efficiency and Inclusive Transitions at the International Energy Agency said: “With the right investments in clean energy and skills training, energy transitions can be a major driver of employment opportunities.

“This research reminds us that cities play a central role in ensuring that, at the local level, energy education and training is accessible and leads to decent employment in energy occupations that are high in demand.

“We look forward to continuing to work with leading mayors, alongside national governments, industry, trade unions and other key stakeholders to ensure fair and inclusive energy transitions for workers and communities.”

Moustapha Kamal Gueye, Director of Priority Action Programme on just transitions at the International Labour Organisation (ILO) said: “Climate action is not just an environmental imperative, it is a core issue of social justice, and green jobs are an essential element of a just transition – as this research shows.

“Cities can be essential allies of national governments, businesses and workers, in promoting social dialogue and ensuring these jobs meet fundamental labour standards.

“We appreciate this solid commitment from the world’s largest cities, as well as the involvement of C40 Cities in the Global Coalition for Social Justice, and we look forward to continuing working together towards a truly just transition.”

Despite this impressive progress, mayors are aware that there is still much work to be done to deliver their 50 million good green jobs commitment by 2030. Therefore, at the World Mayors Summit in Rio de Janeiro, opening a historical COP30, with a clear focus on moving from negotiation to implementation, C40 mayors will call for coordinated action to scale up finance for city-led climate action, strengthen skills training and just transition measures, close the gender and inclusion gaps in green employment and recognise cities’ central role in driving global climate and economic progress.",https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/spai/q_glossy+ret_img+to_webp/www.c40.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/cropped-Favicon-1-32x32.png,N,,2025-10-28 08:19:53.540375

WASHINGTON, D.C. — As temperatures drop and golden leaves cover lawns throughout Canada and the northern United States, residents are starting to turn on the heat. Earlier this year, amid President Donald Trump’s trade war, it appeared that energy tariffs might be used as a weapon, potentially driving up electricity prices for U.S. and Canadian consumers alike.

Canadian energy prices have risen moderately, largely due to inflation and infrastructure upgrades. But with autumn in full swing and winter looming, Americans are being warned that electricity prices are set to soar, and not for the usual reasons like oil or natural gas spikes. Instead, a combination of factors — everything from weather and rising demand to climate change policies and tariffs — is contributing to the increases, and experts see no relief in sight.

The General Assembly faces a Thursday deadline to finalize the legislation, which is being considered as electricity rates skyrocket for consumers and businesses in Illinois and across the nation. Businesses including Akamai Technologies, dsm-Firmenich, HA Sustainable Infrastructure (HASI), Leopardo Construction, Leopardo Energy, Rivian, and Sealed today released a letter supporting CRGA’s passage.

“CRGA presents a practical, forward-thinking path to address Illinois’ most pressing energy challenges. By modernizing infrastructure, expanding access to clean and efficient energy solutions, and preparing the grid for increased energy demand, CRGA offers the tools needed to ensure Illinois’ energy system is competitive, reliable, and aligned with businesses’ plans for innovation and investment in smart technologies,” the signatories wrote in the letter.

Electricity prices are growing at twice the rate of inflation. CRGA is a wide-ranging bill, built around a practical mix of technologies, tools, and policies to affordably and reliably address growing electricity demand.

“Energy reliability and affordability are essential for companies like ours to operate and grow our business,” said Mike Mattera, director of corporate sustainability, Akamai Technologies. “The Clean and Reliable Grid Affordability Act tackles these issues head-on, ensuring that the most affordable and quickest-to-build sources of new power will be delivered efficiently and reliably across Illinois – not only meeting the needs of today’s economy but positioning the state to attract investment and innovation in the years to come. Akamai Technologies strongly supports passage of this crucial legislation.”

“Energy efficiency reduces costs, improves reliability, and creates jobs across Illinois,” said David Kolata, Vice President of Policy, Sealed. “Illinois lawmakers have an opportunity this week to address a pressing economic concern facing households and businesses alike by passing the Clean and Reliable Grid Affordability Act.”

CRGA includes measures such as:

New requirements for utilities to consider upgrades to existing infrastructure that will allow it to operate more efficiently, providing more electricity without requiring expensive new power line construction;

New programs to expand energy storage and implement virtual power plants that tap into extra power from homes and businesses, ensuring electricity is available affordably when it’s needed most;

New and improved energy efficiency programs to help individual households and businesses lower their energy bills while also reducing overall strain on the electric grid;

New energy planning processes to prepare Illinois for the future, such as ensuring utilities are adequately prepared for the needs of new electric vehicles and heat pumps.

The company letter was organized by Ceres.

“The Clean and Reliable Grid Affordability Act is not just a strategy to modernize Illinois’ infrastructure and reduce costs. It is also a bellwether for the nation, and an opportunity for Illinois to lead on an issue that spans from coast to coast,” said Kelly Trombley, senior director of state policy, Ceres. “Clean energy is the most affordable and quickest energy resource to build, and CRGA will make it easier to deploy it across the state. Businesses support this legislation because they are keenly attuned to the energy issues at the heart of our economy and the best ways to address them. Illinois cannot afford to wait. The General Assembly must pass CRGA this week.”

Composting is also highly beneficial for the environment, through reducing the amount of organic waste that ends up in landfills and incinerators.","The town has received a $300,000 grant to install a new composting facility at the Kent transfer station where food scraps will be collected as part of a larger effort by the state to divert organic materials from municipal solid waste, officials said.

The town of Kent is receiving the grant money from the state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection as part of the Sustainable Materials Management Grant program. The SMM grant program supports the development of food scrap collection and unit-based pricing pilot programs to help reduce the amount of organic material being sent to landfills. Over the course of three years, the SMM grant program has funded waste management pilot programs in 15 municipalities with a focus on separation of food scraps from the waste stream.

The Housatonic Resources Recovery Authority, the agency that handles waste and recycling in 14 municipalities in western Connecticut, was awarded a nearly $800,000 grant from DEEP back in May. As part of that money, the municipal waste authority gave the town $300,000 to create a larger solar-powered composting facility, according to HRRA.

The idea is that the Kent composting facility would become the regional hub for surrounding towns like Sharon, Cornwall, Goshen and Washington, said Kent First Selectman Marty Lindenmayer. But Lindenmayer said that the town is still in the permitting process with the state, and a final buildout could take several more months.

“The original site proposed was not at the transfer station, but we realized that’s where it needs to be if we’re going to be regional,” Lindenmayer said. “Because of the plan to be at the transfer station, DEEP said we have to go through a new permitting process. So it looks like there may be a delay by a couple months or weeks. Right now, we’re not sure the timeline with the regulatory piece.”

The town has been piloting a composting program for two years, where residents can purchase a compost bin and bring it to the town’s transfer station, which is open on weekends.

Earlier this year, the town partnered with metroSTOR, offering heavy duty and bear-proof collection boxes for organic waste scraps around town. Residents can now drop off their organic waste into one of these collection boxes 24/7 and not have to wait until the weekend, according to Lindenmayer. Because the permitting process is under review, he said the town is no longer able to collect organic waste at the transfer station until the new facility is approved by the state.

“Composting has been very successful for us. We saved a lot of money through diverting food scraps from our solid waste over the past year,” he said.

“We estimate we saved around 26 tons of organic waste last year from the landfill. So anytime we can take that much out of the waste stream or not have to transfer out to facilities, is a win for our town. The tipping costs have gone up considerably, so it’s leading to savings. The town is 100% behind this composting facility, and we’re hoping the permit process goes quickly,” he said.

Saving money for scraps

Tipping fees refers to the disposal of waste at transfer stations or landfills in Connecticut where fees are often charged based on the type of waste, its weight or the volume of bags used. Many towns have specific regulations for different items like appliances, tires or bulky waste and encourage residents to reduce waste and recycle to lower costs.

The SSM grant application selection criteria picks communities that plan to use a unit-based pricing structure. UBP charges residents based on how much waste is collected rather than through a fixed fee or property taxes. However, under this same structure, there is only a fee based on the weight of solid waste, meaning households who recycle more will pay less through reducing the weight of their trash. There are no fees for recycling or compost weight.

The more organic waste that gets diverted from the waste stream, the less money municipalities also have to pay in tipping fees to haul trash away.

“When we started the pilot program in Kent in 2023, the town had between a 20 to 30% capture rate for organic materials. That’s actually a very high number” said Kristen Brown, vice president of waste reduction strategy at WasteZero, a consultant group advising the DEEP grant recipients. “But once the town implemented unit-based pricing in June of 2024, the capture rate went up significantly to around 70%.”

Brown said that 15 municipalities in the state now have unit-based pricing programs in place, providing a financial incentive for households to remove organic material from their solid waste by reducing the price of their disposal.

DEEP officials say that communities that implement UBP reduce waste by 40 to 55%, resulting in an average rate of waste disposed per person of between 400 and 500 pounds per year. This is much lower than in communities without UBP programs in place, with an estimated average rate of disposal of 740 pounds per person per year.

“Around 10% of the population are always recycling, another 10% never recycle. It’s all the folks in the middle that we need to capture,” Brown said. “Typically, without unit-based pricing, most communities only get around 10% or less capture rates for organic materials. That number dramatically increases when you implement UBP. When people are paying as they go for their trash, many more people will use the food scrap option. They will taken that extra 10 minutes to put their food scraps in another container when it saves them money.”

Connecticut’s waste crisis

The SMM grant program marks the state’s largest investment in local and regional waste management infrastructure as a direct response to Connecticut’s waste crisis. The closure of MIRA’s major trash-to-energy plant in Hartford in 2022 forced the state to ship hundreds of thousands of tons of waste to other states, a costly way of disposing trash that leaves municipalities with little other options.

Connecticut ships approximately 40-42% of its municipal solid waste, or about 860,000 to 940,000 tons annually, out of state for disposal, primarily to landfills in Pennsylvania and Ohio, according to DEEP. But as those landfills begin to reach capacity, moving trash out of state becomes more and more costly, as fees increase to move a large chunk of the state’s solid waste.

“When I started around 30 years go, there were just over 6,000 landfills in the U.S., today there is just around 1,000 left,” Brown said. “Trash has not really come down since then, but our population has grown. Yet we aren’t really changing the dynamic and it’s getting worse. No one wants to think about our trash but waste budgets are increasing year after year. Around 80% of landfills are now owned by major waste companies that are charging more in tipping fees year after year.”

DEEP estimates that 41% of what residents throw away in trash is organic material, including food scraps and yard waste. This waste often then gets shipped out of state and is landfilled instead of being repurposed for composting, biogas and animal feed. Removing them from the waste stream reduces the costs of disposal as municipalities pay by weight in the state.

Around 22% of trash in Connecticut alone is food scraps, DEEP estimates.

Composting is also highly beneficial for the environment, through reducing the amount of organic waste that ends up in landfills and incinerators. This prevents the release of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, and allows for carbon sequestration in the soil, according to DEEP.

“Food is energy and when food is not eaten and those calories are not used, they are still real,” Brown said. “So when you move food out of the waste stream into an anaerobic digester, those calories become energy. You don’t lose anything from that energy. So it doesn’t make sense to me that we’re throwing away and shipping out this energy source to a Pennsylvania landfill when we could have this great energy source here in Connecticut.”

An anaerobic digester is an enclosed system that uses microorganisms to break down organic matter without oxygen, producing a biogas (primarily methane and carbon dioxide) and a nutrient-rich byproduct called digestate. The biogas can be used to generate renewable energy, and the digestate can be used as a fertilizer or soil amendment. Quantum Biopower in Southington has so far built the state’s only commercial anaerobic digester.

“Composting programs have helped keep food scraps, yard trimmings and grass out of the waste stream, reduce waste handling and disposal costs, return valuable nutrients to the soil and reduce the need for chemical fertilizers, thereby decreasing non-point source pollution,” Brown said.

Rader is supporting a Republican-backed effort to introduce more community renewable energy projects in Ohio.","Editor's note: This is part two of the three-part ""State of Energy"" series from WOSU. Look for part three tomorrow.

The air quality in Ohio is getting worse.

Brittany Sinzinger has been the executive director for the American Lung Association of Columbus for 13 years.

“If you look at our newest report, the 26th annual ""State of Air"" report that came out, it is showing that about 50% of the population is breathing air that is not good for them,"" Sinzinger said.

Several Ohio metro areas made the lung association’s top 25 list for worst year-round particle pollution, including Cincinnati, Cleveland and Akron.

The lung association ranks the air quality in Columbus as an overall “C,” but it gets an “F” for particle pollution.

Sinzinger said there’s a reason these particles and the human body shouldn’t mix.

“They are various sizes, so there are teeny, teeny, tiny ones and then there are some that are larger and when we inhale those, the larger ones, our bodies are made to expel those so we cough or we sneeze, but there's tiny, tiny little particles that can wedge themselves down into our lungs and get into that tissue and that can be very dangerous for people,"" Sinzinger said.

Particle pollution has a bigger impact on the human body than other types of pollution like ozone. It's the most dangerous type of air pollution to human health, according to the lung association. The pollution can cause lung cancer, asthma, heart attack, stroke and can impair cognitive function.

As previously written in part one of this series on Monday, Ohio was supposed to generate 25% percent of its energy with renewable sources by 2025. It’s 2025, and the state has only reached a fifth of that goal.

After that bipartisan goal was made in 2008, the fossil fuel lobby and global forces shifted state energy policy against the renewable market. Experts report the move hurt a once-growing industry in Ohio, and damaged public health and the environment.

Some industries create more particle pollution than others.

Sinzinger said factories, power plants, manufacturing, vehicles powered by diesel and gasoline and anything that burns raw materials on a large scale create the large particles that are bad for human health.

These bad particles can blow in from production centers elsewhere and can get trapped because of geological features of the land.

Ohio's electric power sector is one of the state’s most emissive because of how much coal is still in the mix, and coal power plants are a top producer of particulate pollution, according to the National Institute of Health. Researchers there found a direct correlation between burning coal and increased mortality rates.

Ohio House Rep. Tristan Rader, Parma-D, said fossil fuel companies have had a stranglehold over Ohio’s politicians, on both sides of the aisle.

“I think it's just total utility capture,"" Rader said. ""Total utility regulatory capture and then their ability to just throw enough money around to always get politicians on their side to get done whatever they need to get done until whatever they don't like.”

Rader said energy companies have been too cozy with lawmakers in the past.

“I look at it as just way too much money influence with the utilities here in Ohio,"" Rader said.

Ohio’s energy users only get 4% of their energy from renewable sources, putting it 44th in the country.

Renewable sources produce less particle emissions and have less energy loss.

Jeff Bielicki is the research lead at Ohio State University’s Sustainability Institute. He said the state hasn’t balanced the environmental and health concerns with the economics of its energy policies, but has only focused on the ability of utility companies to make a profit.

“We need to consider the air that we breathe, the water that we drink, and so on, and how that sustains our well-being. The environment is an important component of our well being. The economy is also an important component of well being, the ability to make money, have a job, is an important component of well being too,"" Bielicki said.

Bielicki warns that climate change is also putting more demand on our energy usage.

“It's clear that temperatures are getting hotter on average over time, which leads to more demand for cooling, air conditioning, for example, and all else equal less demand for heating. Because temperatures are warmer. And that, in essence, shifts the demand profile from heating,"" Bielicki said.

Energy sources like natural gas are easily converted into heat, but more resources are needed to create electricity to power cooling systems.

Restrictions on the renewable energy industry in some states have prevented the generation of much needed electricity by alternative sources, prompting states like Pennsylvania to delay closing coal power plants.

Demands on the power grid are growing, and Ohio lawmakers say they’re now embracing all energy sources.

“I think there's this new willingness to push back the utilities that have gone way too far for way too long, and we need to make sure that we represent the people that live in our districts, (and) that deserve protection and deserve monopolies be held accountable,” Rader said.

Rader is supporting a Republican-backed effort to introduce more community renewable energy projects in Ohio.

“The economics of these projects being kind of efficient, not having to rely on the transmission grid, or not having you bid into this giant system, there's a little bit of savings that folks can get,"" Rader said.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/18a6f82/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4624x2428+0+522/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F27%2F88%2F7887059546f7b6cece9a43faadfb%2Futility-lines.jpg,N,,2025-10-28 05:57:54.592948

Northern Indiana Public Service Co. is launching a spinoff company, GenCo, that is exempt from many of the regulatory proceedings typically required before power plants can be built in the state. The utility, also known as NIPSCO, says that this will allow the new entity to quickly provide the copious amounts of energy that data centers need without pushing excessive costs onto other consumers.

But the move is raising alarm bells for watchdog groups and other critics, who argue that rather than protect consumers, the plan will mainly enrich the utility’s parent company while interfering with market competition and undercutting important regulatory safeguards. It could also set back the state’s clean-energy transition, advocates say.

As regulators around the country wrestle with how to get a lot of power online quickly to serve ​“hyperscaler” AI data centers, other utilities may be looking at NIPSCO’s ​“unique arrangement” as ​“a model for how to maximize profits while meeting new data-center demand,” said Emily Piontek, a regulatory associate at the nonprofit Clean Grid Alliance.

Beating other states in the data-center race

Indiana is attractive to huge data centers because of its cheap land, ample water, special state tax breaks on equipment and energy, and access to both the PJM Interconnection and Midcontinent Independent System Operator regional electric grids. The State Utility Forecasting Group at Purdue University recently predicted that data centers will almost double Indiana’s energy demand by 2035.

NIPSCO highlighted that boom to the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission during the case proceedings to create GenCo. Vincent Parisi, president and CEO of both NIPSCO and GenCo, told regulators about the sheer number of requests the utility has gotten from potential ​“megaload” customers, generally data centers, seeking hundreds or even thousands of megawatts of electricity.

But it’s a competitive business, with other states and municipalities courting the same data centers. NIPSCO says that providing new power quickly, through GenCo, will be key to securing the deals.

The regulatory commission agreed with this reasoning, writing in its September order approving the GenCo plan, ​“The evidence shows that megaload customers are sophisticated and have many choices available to them when determining where to make developments.” The commission added that relinquishing its jurisdiction over aspects of GenCo ​“will enable NIPSCO to support Indiana’s efforts to compete with other states to attract this economic development.”

Will GenCo help or hurt Indiana households?

Nationwide, regulators and advocates have grappled with concerns that residential customers could pick up too much of the tab for new generation built to power data centers, especially if the computing warehouses don’t materialize or don’t use as much power as predicted.

NIPSCO says GenCo will protect customers from such costs since it will be responsible for providing the data centers with power. That means those expenses won’t be rolled into the rates paid by other NIPSCO consumers, the utility says.

But Citizens Action Coalition, the state’s main consumer-advocacy group, argues that the GenCo structure doesn’t really insulate customers from the risks of the data-center market.

If GenCo were to lose money, that could affect the finances and credit rating of parent company NiSource and hence impact NIPSCO’s customers, said Citizens Action Coalition Executive Director Kerwin Olson. And he worries some costs of data-center power infrastructure could still be passed on to residential customers, hidden in an opaque process created specifically for GenCo.

In September, the state regulatory commission exempted GenCo from a host of usual procedures. Chief among them is that GenCo does not have to file a detailed plan when it wants to build or acquire new generation. The commission did not set any minimum standards or requirements regarding how power will be provided to data centers, as advocates had hoped. Instead, the commission will review each proposed contract between NIPSCO and a data center, and the related power purchase agreement between NIPSCO and GenCo.

The Citizens Action Coalition called this case-by-case review process unfair and inefficient, making it too difficult for stakeholders to monitor the situation and submit public comments to the commission.

“Every single time a data center comes online, there’s another case; there’s no minimum criteria or boxes that need to be checked,” said Olson. ​“I know they’re claiming costs won’t be passed on to ratepayers, but we’ve been around the block. When you have what will likely be confidential special contracts, everything redacted, it’s going to be really challenging for stakeholders to dive into the details to ensure that none of these costs are being passed on.”

NIPSCO declined to answer questions but referred Canary Media to a press release quoting Lloyd Yates, NiSource president and CEO, regarding the regulatory commission’s decision.

“This is an important step forward to position Northern Indiana at the center of a fast-growing, economically essential industry,” Yates said.

The Citizens Action Coalition and the Indiana Office of Utility Consumer Counselor, a state agency tasked with protecting consumers, notified the commission that they plan to appeal the approval of GenCo.

Concerns about a market edge

Another major concern of critics is that GenCo will have an unfair competitive advantage over other power producers.

Indiana has a regulated energy market, wherein utilities have the right to serve as monopoly producers and distributors of energy, but regulators must approve how much capacity they build or buy and what they charge customers for the power.

GenCo is largely exempt from this structure, acting more akin to a power producer in a state like Illinois, with a deregulated market. But in Illinois, power producers compete to sell their energy to utilities, whereas GenCo has a guaranteed customer in the form of NIPSCO, and the two sister companies — which share the same parent — set the price NIPSCO will pay GenCo for power.

“The utility affiliate is being treated like an unregulated independent power producer while retaining the guarantee of a monopoly market enjoyed by regulated utilities,” Piontek said. ​“Essentially, the arrangement insulates GenCo from market forces, and [it] is not subjected to rate regulation. It’s going to be a very profitable arrangement for the parent company and its shareholders … by providing the affiliate with an unearned competitive advantage.”

The Clean Grid Alliance — made up of renewable-energy developers, environmental groups, and other stakeholders — and Takanock, a data-center developer, told regulators in a joint brief that GenCo ​“turns the federal paradigm which encourages competition … on its head by proposing that GenCo, and only GenCo, provides generation services to NIPSCO to serve its megaload customers.”

In testimony, Takanock founder and CEO Kenneth Davies told regulators about problems his company has had trying to acquire power from NIPSCO for a planned data center. Davies described the NIPSCO-GenCo relationship as ​“anticompetitive,” and lamented that NIPSCO will not allow new data-center customers to buy power on the open market themselves, as some existing industrial customers are allowed to do. Davies said NIPSCO seems to be ​“picking and choosing” which data centers to prioritize, and he is worried Takanock could be treated unfairly, since confidential contracts would make it difficult to compare the arrangements other data centers are getting.

Davies and other stakeholders say there are ways for NIPSCO to protect customers from data-center costs without creating a new market entity with an unfair edge.

Takanock and the Clean Grid Alliance, in their filing, criticize GenCo for failing to explore the more common method of pricing tariffs designed specifically for data centers. That’s where a utility makes an agreement with state regulators to treat data centers differently from other customers, ensuring they pay their fair share of costs. Davies described Wyoming regulators’ creation of such a special tariff to serve a Microsoft data center. Davies was Microsoft’s director of renewable-energy strategy and research at the time.

In another example, Citizens Action Coalition reached an agreement last year with utility Indiana Michigan Power and three new data centers, requiring long contracts, exit fees, and other protections to ensure the centers pay the full costs of infrastructure built to serve them, even if they don’t use as much power or operate for as long as expected. The agreement also requires the data centers to pay millions of dollars to support low-income electricity customers with benefits like weatherization.

Advocates point out that Indiana already has a law on the books meant to help utilities more quickly get power online to supply data centers, without sacrificing transparency or relying on a new entity like GenCo. HB 1007, enacted in May, gives utilities an expedited approval process for new generation if they provide information about the impacts on customers, predicted load growth for the next five years, and the potential of grid-enhancing tech to avoid investments in new power plants, among other things.

“NIPSCO decided to ignore 1007 and create what we think is a shell game, a scam, with this unregulated affiliate doing Lord knows what,” said Olson.

Clean-energy implications

The creation of GenCo will likely undermine the clean-energy transition in northern Indiana, advocates say. NIPSCO has already made clear its plans to build lots of natural-gas-fired generation to power data centers, and if this is carried out through GenCo, stakeholders will have little opportunity to weigh in on the implications.

This is a disappointing shift for environmental groups that had praised NIPSCO for plans it announced in 2018 to retire all coal plants within a decade and build out renewables, reducing carbon emissions by 90%.

By contrast, NIPSCO’s 2024 Integrated Resource Plan says that if contracts with data centers are in place, the utility will build over 1,700 megawatts of gas generation by 2030 and another over 2,000 MW by 2035. Already, NIPSCO is seeking an air permit to build 2,300 MW of gas-fired generation at the site of a retiring coal plant, in order to serve data centers.

“GenCo is certainly a concern for the climate, demonstrating that NIPSCO has done a complete strategy reversal on sustainability,” said Ben Inskeep, program director at Citizens Action Coalition. He said the utility’s 2018 resource plan ​“was groundbreaking for leading the way on a clean-energy transition. Now, they are pursuing a strategy that appears to be 100% natural gas for new data centers, with no additional clean energy to serve the additional load.”

If NIPSCO had to turn to the open market to procure the power that data centers need, Piontek noted, more renewables would likely get built along with the gas-fired generation.

“Clean-energy resources like wind, solar, and energy storage outcompete other resources in speed-to-market and remain the most cost-effective resources available, making them an attractive option for bringing data centers online in Indiana,” Piontek said.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/53681144380_6d03e45ffe_c.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=f798e967b3acc1c6872028f43313dd41,N,,2025-10-28 05:57:58.186818

A deceleration in production capacity in EIA’s category renewable diesel and other biofuels accounted for most of the slowdown in growth.

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), renewable naphtha, and renewable propane make up virtually all of the other biofuels.

Renewable diesel and other biofuels

Renewable diesel and other biofuels production capacity increased just 391 million gallons per year (gal/y) in 2024, less than one-third of the growth observed in 2022 and 2023.

In 2024, only two capacity additions came online, both in California: Phillips 66’s conversion of its Rodeo refinery to exclusively produce biofuels and the new Renewable Fuels plant in Bakersfield.

With the completed conversion, the Rodeo plant has a capacity of 767 million gal/y, up from 180 million gal/y in last year’s report.

This increase makes it the second-largest renewable diesel plant in the US, behind Diamond Green Diesel’s 982-million-gal/y plant in Norco, Louisiana.

US capacity growth from the Rodeo expansion and the 138-million-gal/y Bakersfield plant was partially offset by the loss of capacity at four facilities.

Monroe Energy and Chevron stopped co-processing renewable diesel at their Trainer, Pennsylvania, and El Segundo, California, refineries, respectively. Vertex Energy and Jaxon Energy closed plants in Mobile, Alabama, and Jackson, Mississippi, respectively.

The loss of renewable diesel capacity at four facilities reflects changes to biofuel margins and petroleum refining margins since 2020.

Low refinery margins and rising biofuel credit values in 2020 and 2021 prompted a wave of renewable diesel capacity announcements.

As more of those plants started operations, biofuel production began exceeding target volumes, and biofuel credit values and margins decreased in 2023.

At the same time, petroleum refinery margins were much stronger than their 2020 lows, resulting in a slowdown in investments to expand renewable diesel capacity for the upcoming years.

A notable shift in 2024 was the increased focus on SAF.

SAF is an alternative to petroleum jet fuel that capture in other biofuels category.

Other biofuels includes SAF, renewable heating oil, renewable naphtha, renewable propane, renewable gasoline, and other emerging biofuels.

EIA combine other biofuels with renewable diesel capacity because other biofuels are mostly produced at renewable diesel plants as byproducts or, often in the case of SAF, in place of renewable diesel.

Following the completion of conversion projects in 2024, Phillips 66’s Rodeo plant can shift about 150 million gal/y of its renewable diesel production capacity to SAF, and Diamond Green Diesel can shift about 235 million gal/y to SAF.

Biodiesel

In addition to slower growth in renewable diesel production capacity, biodiesel production capacity decreased slightly.

In 2024, eight biodiesel plants closed due to poor margins, resulting in a loss of about 100 million gal/y of production capacity.

Fuel ethanol

Unlike renewable diesel and biodiesel, US fuel ethanol production capacity increased more in 2024 than in previous years.

Fuel ethanol accounts for 73 per cent of all biofuels production capacity, with a total of almost 18.5 billion gallons of capacity per year.

Most of this production is concentrated in Midwest states, where corn is produced for feedstock.",https://cms360.alhilalgroup.com//source/TA/2025/10/28/TA_20251028103256.jpg,N,,2025-10-28 06:18:18.063423

This month's Nature Quest is about that very question. Listener Molly Magid in New Zealand wanted to know if and how other communities have chosen the path of ""managed retreat."" That's the purposeful and coordinated movement of people and assets out of harm's way.

The topic of managed retreat has been an ongoing conversation for many in western Alaska, long before the remnants of Typhoon Halong slammed into the coast and displaced up to 2,000 people from their homes. With climate change, these communities face increased flooding, coastal erosion and melting permafrost. For many, safety means going elsewhere.

Morris Alexie hopes that means his community of Nunapitchuk. A local tribal liaison, he says they've chosen a new site around 3 or 4 miles away on higher ground, ""We would not be moving somewhere far from what we've grown up eating and living off of.""

Over the same period, consumers paid about £43.2bn in green subsidies, levied on electricity bills rather than gas bills.
The net result was a reduction of £104.3bn in UK energy bills over the 13-year period, according to the researchers.
Solar and wind generation today are four times what the International Energy Agency in 2015 forecast they would be.
Wind power is cheaper, cleaner and more secure than new gas – helping us bring down bills for good.","Wind power has cut at least £104bn from energy costs in the UK since 2010, a study has found.

Users of gas have been among the biggest beneficiaries, the research suggested.

Research by University College London found that from 2010 to 2023, energy from windfarms resulted in electricity bills being lower by about £14.2bn than they would have been if gas had been needed to generate the same amount of power.

However, the reduction in the cost of gas that could be attributed to wind generation – owing to the cut in demand and not needing to build new infrastructure – was much greater, at about £133.3bn.

Over the same period, consumers paid about £43.2bn in green subsidies, levied on electricity bills rather than gas bills. The net result was a reduction of £104.3bn in UK energy bills over the 13-year period, according to the researchers.

Surging renewable energy generation across Europe made demand for gas – and thus gas prices – lower than they would otherwise have been, and meant electricity companies had less need to build costly new gas-fired power stations, according to the analysis. The way that the UK’s energy market works also means gas-fired power stations are in effect allowed to set the price of electricity.

The analysis applied to 2010-23, leaving out the lingering impacts of the leap in gas prices in early 2022, when Russia invaded Ukraine.

Colm O’Shea, a former hedge fund manager, now a master’s student at UCL and lead author of the report, said: “Far from being a financial burden, this study demonstrates how wind generation has consistently delivered substantial financial benefits to the UK. To put it into context, this net benefit of £104bn is larger than the additional £90bn the UK has spent on gas since 2021 as a result of rising prices related to the war in Ukraine.

“This study demonstrates why we should reframe our understanding of green investment from costly environmental subsidy to a high-return national investment.”

Mark Maslin, a professor of Earth system science at UCL, said the UK’s consumers would benefit to a greater extent if the electricity market were reformed to reflect the reality that wind generation was reducing bills. “At some stage, the UK government must decouple gas and electricity prices,” he said. “That would mean gas prices would reflect the global markets, while the electricity price would reflect the savings from wind and solar.”

Ana Musat, the director of policy at RenewableUK, the trade body for the wind sector, said: “This research highlights the long-term economic benefits for UK plc of investing in renewable energy generation. The only way to reduce energy costs for good is to minimise our exposure to volatile global fossil fuel prices and increase the share of electricity generation from clean homegrown sources.”

The government disappointed the wind industry and renewable energy advocates on Monday by setting out a lower amount of available subsidy than some had hoped for in an auction for new offshore wind capacity. Only about £1.1bn was made available in the auction.

Musat said: “The wind industry alone employs 55,000 people and this is set to double to 110,000 by 2030. Every gigawatt of offshore wind brings £2bn-£3bn in private investment to the UK. That’s why it’s so important that we procure significant volumes of new wind and solar capacity in the auction for clean power contracts, with the budget set at an ambitious level to enable us to make the most of the opportunity to stabilise the cost of energy.”

Michael Shanks, the energy minister, said: “Our competitive new auction process will allow us to buy the right amount of clean power at the right price on behalf of the British people, so we can take back control of our energy.”

Separately, analysis from the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit thinktank found that in the 10 years since the Paris agreement was signed in 2015 there have been far greater increases in renewable energy generation than was envisaged at the time.

In 2015, BP predicted that non-fossil fuels would take a 38% share of global power generation by 2035, but already they account for 41%. Solar and wind generation today are four times what the International Energy Agency in 2015 forecast they would be.

The deployment of electric vehicles has also risen faster than expected: the 2015 target of 100m EVs on the road by 2030 is likely to be hit in two years.

Ed Miliband, the energy secretary, said: “Clean homegrown power is the right choice for families, industry and the nation for many years to come. Wind power is cheaper, cleaner and more secure than new gas – helping us bring down bills for good.

“And with a competitive new process to secure more wind in our upcoming renewables auction, we will take back control of our energy and bring the next generation of opportunity to British coastlines and heartlands.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ef5d88fbf1686b46b9710ad17d4c7ef445de7bc4/0_67_3599_2878/master/3599.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8394f992bc25650d1e740d4b6f4d1bbf",N,,2025-10-28 03:17:33.498814

For an industry still learning to compete with Asian manufacturing prowess, it signals a troubling pattern: political opposition may be undermining America's ability to acquire the technical expertise needed to build a competitive domestic battery sector.

A missed learning opportunity

When Gotion first announced its Michigan plans in October 2022, the project promised 2,350 jobs and represented something potentially more valuable than investment dollars—a chance for American workers to learn from one of the world's leading battery manufacturers. The company, a subsidiary of China's Gotion High-Tech, brought decades of large-scale battery production experience that US manufacturers are still working to develop.

""There's a world of difference between writing a recipe or seeing a recipe and going, 'Yeah, I know how to do that,' and actually producing the dish,"" explained Celina Mikolajczak, then Chief Battery Technical Officer at Lyten, in a 2024 Battery Show North America panel discussion. ""Asia has been doing the cooking. They have been making the cells and learning all the little things, all the little details, all the little bits and bobs of what makes a good cell, what makes a high-volume production line.""

The Gotion project would have provided exactly this kind of hands-on manufacturing knowledge transfer—Chinese expertise applied in an American facility, creating jobs while building domestic capabilities.

The political headwinds

Instead, the project became a political lightning rod. Republican lawmakers, led by Representative John Moolenaar who chairs a House select committee on China, worked to oppose the project and bar US government subsidies for Chinese-affiliated battery companies. Local opposition in Green Charter Township was so intense that voters recalled township officials who supported the project in 2023.

Reuters reports that in a letter to Michigan Economic Development Corporation (MEDC) the company's attorney blamed ""politically motivated"" opposition driven by ""racist and ethnically charged stereotypes"" for creating the litigation and delays that ultimately doomed the project. By September, the declared Gotion in default of its agreement, citing no activity at the project site for more than 120 days.

Contrast with CATL

The Gotion failure stands in stark contrast to other international partnerships that successfully transfer battery manufacturing knowledge to US operations. Ford's licensing agreement with CATL for lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery production represents the kind of structured collaboration that industry experts advocate.

""CATL working with Ford, LG working with GM—this is a great opportunity to learn how to make lithium-ion batteries because we just don't know how to do it,"" noted ARPA-E Program Director Halle Cheeseman in a Battery Show North America panel discussion.

These partnerships follow a proven model: foreign companies provide technology and manufacturing expertise while American companies maintain ownership and operational control. James Frith, Principal at Volta Energy Technologies, has pointed to the Ford-CATL structure as an example of how to address concerns about foreign control while still accessing critical technical knowledge.

""If there are concerns over taking too much foreign investment or overseas companies controlling too much critical infrastructure, this licensing model could be more broadly explored,"" Frith explained.

The strategic cost

The collapse of the Gotion project carries implications beyond Michigan's borders. As Avicenne Energy Senior Adviser Michael Sanders has noted, attempting to build battery manufacturing capabilities without learning from established producers is ""a fool's proposition.""

""There's so many subtleties on how to make a battery and how to do it well that trying to do it all on your own"" simply isn't viable, Sanders explained in an earlier Battery Show panel. ""The idea here is not to say, I'm going to let the Chinese or Koreans or whatever come in and run it and run it for multiple years. You have to get to the point that your team learns to where you can take control to whatever strategic destiny you want to be.""

The Michigan project would have provided exactly this kind of learning opportunity—Chinese manufacturing expertise deployed in an American facility, with American workers gaining the hands-on experience that textbooks and engineering degrees cannot provide.

Industry implications

Michigan taxpayers will bear the immediate cost of the project's failure. The state is pursuing repayment of $23.6 million spent purchasing land for the facility, while the remaining $125 million in promised incentives was never disbursed. The project was a high-profile beneficiary of Governor Gretchen Whitmer's $2 billion Strategic Outreach and Attraction Reserve fund, which, Bridge Michigan reports, the Legislature defunded earlier this month.

For the broader US battery industry, the Gotion collapse raises uncomfortable questions about America's ability to compete in a sector where manufacturing expertise remains concentrated in Asia. While political concerns about Chinese investment are understandable, the industry's technical realities suggest that some form of international collaboration remains essential for building domestic capabilities.

The challenge for policymakers and industry leaders is finding structures that address legitimate security concerns while still enabling the knowledge transfer that American battery manufacturing desperately needs. The Ford-CATL model offers one template, but the Gotion failure suggests that even well-structured partnerships may struggle against political headwinds.

As the US races to build a competitive battery industry, the Michigan experience serves as a cautionary tale about the costs of letting political considerations override industrial strategy. In a sector where manufacturing expertise can take decades to develop, missed learning opportunities may prove more expensive than any upfront investment.

The question now is whether other states and communities will learn from Michigan's experience—or repeat it.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltb299798942522069/blt6b3f3f5953b600e6/68ffa0ad1e46315b5e2d5ba2/MI-Gotion-protest-2167981161.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-10-28 01:17:59.828404

He expects his “tough truths about climate” memo will be controversial.
But, she said, Gates assumes the world stays static and only one variable changes — faster deployment of green technologies — to curb climate change.","NEW YORK(AP) — Bill Gates thinks climate change is a serious problem but it won't be the end of civilization. He thinks scientific innovation will curb it, and it’s instead time for a “strategic pivot” in the global climate fight: from focusing on limiting rising temperatures to fighting poverty and preventing disease.

A doomsday outlook has led the climate community to focus too much on near-term goals to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that cause warming, diverting resources from the most effective things that can be done to improve life in a warming world, Gates said. In a memo released Tuesday, Gates said the world’s primary goal should instead be to prevent suffering, particularly for those in the toughest conditions in the world’s poorest countries.

If given a choice between eradicating malaria and a tenth of a degree increase in warming, Gates told reporters, “I’ll let the temperature go up 0.1 degree to get rid of malaria. People don’t understand the suffering that exists today.”

The Microsoft co-founder spends most of his time now on the goals of the Gates Foundation, which has poured tens of billions of dollars into health care, education and development initiatives worldwide, including combating HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. He started Breakthrough Energy in 2015 to speed up innovation in clean energy.

He wrote his 17-page memo hoping to have an impact on next month’s United Nations climate change conference in Brazil. He’s urging world leaders to ask whether the little money designated for climate is being spent on the right things.

Gates, whose foundation provides financial support for Associated Press coverage of health and development in Africa, is influential in the climate change conversation. He expects his “tough truths about climate” memo will be controversial.

“If you think climate is not important, you won’t agree with the memo. If you think climate is the only cause and apocalyptic, you won’t agree with the memo,” Gates said during a roundtable discussion with reporters ahead of the release. “It’s kind of this pragmatic view of somebody who’s, you know, trying to maximize the money and the innovation that goes to help in these poor countries.”

Every bit of additional warming correlates to more extreme weather, risks species extinction and brings the world closer to crossing tipping points where changes become irreversible, scientists say.

University of Washington public health and climate scientist Kristie Ebi said she thoroughly agrees with Gates that the U.N. negotiations should focus on improving human health and well-being. But, she said, Gates assumes the world stays static and only one variable changes — faster deployment of green technologies — to curb climate change. She called that unlikely.

Jeffrey Sachs, director of the Center for Sustainable Development at Columbia University, called the memo “pointless, vague, unhelpful and confusing.”

“There is no reason to pit poverty reduction versus climate transformation. Both are utterly feasible, and readily so, if the Big Oil lobby is brought under control,” he wrote in an email.

Stanford University climate scientist Chris Field said there is room for a healthy discussion about whether the current framing of the climate crisis is typically too pessimistic.

“But we should also invest for both the long term and the short term,” he wrote in an email. “A vibrant long-term future depends on both tackling climate change and supporting human development.”

Princeton University climate scientist Michael Oppenheimer said he doesn't dispute the principle of making human well-being the primary objective of policy, but what about the natural world?

“Climate change is already wreaking havoc there,"" he wrote in an email. ""Can we truly live in a technological bubble? Do we want to?”

Gates is clear in his memo that every tenth of a degree of warming matters: ""A stable climate makes it easier to improve people's lives.”

A decade ago, the world agreed in a historic pact known as the Paris agreement to try to limit human-caused warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) since pre-industrial times. The goal: to stave off nastier heat waves, wildfires, storms and droughts.

In a 2021 book, Gates laid out a plan for reducing emissions to avoid a climate disaster. But humans are on track to release so much greenhouse gas by early 2028 that scientists say crossing that 1.5-degree threshold is now nearly unavoidable.

Breakthrough Energy focuses on areas where the cost of doing something cleanly is much higher than the polluting way, such as making clean steel and cement. Gates concluded his memo by saying governments should work toward driving this difference to zero, and be rigorous about measuring the impact of every effort in the world’s climate agenda.

Gates said the pace of innovation in clean energy has been faster than he expected, allowing cheap solar and wind energy to replace coal, oil and natural gas plants for electricity and averting worst-case warming scenarios. Artificial intelligence is helping accelerate advances in clean energy technologies, he added.

At the same time, money to help developing countries adapt to climate change is shrinking. Led by the United States, rich countries are cutting their foreign aid budgets. President Donald Trump has called climate change a hoax.

Gates criticized the aid cuts. He said Gavi, a public-private partnership started by his philanthropic foundation that buys vaccines, will have 25% less money for the next five years compared to the past five years. Gavi can save a life for a little more than $1,000, he added.

Vaccines become even more important in a warming world because children who aren’t dying of measles or whooping cough will be more likely to survive when a heat wave hits or a drought threatens the local food supply, he wrote.

Health and prosperity are the best defense against climate change, Gates said, citing research from the University of Chicago Climate Impact Lab that found projected deaths from climate change fall by more than 50% when accounting for the expected economic growth over the rest of this century.

Under these circumstances, he thinks the bar must be “very high” for what’s funded with aid money.

“If you have something that gets rid of 10,000 tons of emissions, that you’re spending several million dollars on,"" he said, “that just doesn’t make the cut.”

DOE’s Office of Science has issued its Fusion Science & Technology Roadmap (Roadmap), incorporating input from over 600 scientists and engineers across the public and private sectors, national laboratories, universities, and international partners. The Roadmap establishes a three-pronged “Build-Innovate-Grow” framework focused on balancing collaboration among state and federal government entities and across private enterprise with a goal of fostering a competitive commercial landscape.

The Roadmap also lays out 10 key actions and six core challenges over the coming decade to build toward deployment of fusion energy at scale in the U.S. by the mid-2030s. Key actions for industry and policymakers include using artificial intelligence (AI) models to solve technical challenges around sustained and controlled plasma burning, building out multiple scaled demonstration facilities, addressing supply chain constraints, and developing a path toward broader commercialization. Beyond the clear hurdles that remain with respect to generating and controlling sustained net-energy-positive fusion reactions, further challenges identified by the Roadmap include development of technologies to produce, handle, and recycle fuel materials like tritium as well as development of the balance-of-plant systems to convert energy output from the fusion engine into usable power delivered into the grid.

In parallel, the bipartisan Commission has released a report titled Fusion Forward: Powering America's Future (Fusion Forward Report), which emphasizes the growing competition between the United States and China to achieve dominance in harnessing this emerging energy technology, and the steps the United States must take in both public and private sectors to win this race. Although the United States continues to lead in scientific development, China has poured billions of dollars into the development of both physical infrastructure and scientific expertise to foster fusion energy buildout.

To support fusion buildout in America, the Fusion Forward Report makes a number of recommendations, including a presidential Executive Order (EO) building on President Trump’s Unleashing American Energy EO by declaring fusion energy to be a national security priority, marshalling the resources of the government to support the construction of multiple industry-led fusion power demonstration plants in the United States before the end of 2028. The report sets a goal of $10 billion in investment for development of both fusion infrastructure and R&D. Finally, the report identifies a number of legal and regulatory challenges that need to be addressed to avoid unnecessary roadblocks to rapid deployment.

In addition to the reports from DOE and the bipartisan Commission, the Clean Air Task Force (CATF) has also released a white paper detailing State Policy Options for Fusion Energy Deployment, outlining concrete steps that state policymakers can implement to prepare for fusion energy coming online at scale. Pulling on actions taken in individual states across the country to develop a toolkit for lawmakers, the CATF recommendations include updating state renewable energy portfolio standards and clean energy standards to include fusion, centralizing permitting and regulation of fusion energy in a single (adequately funded) agency, regulating byproducts to be treated as equivalent to similar X-ray materials, and creating a fast-track permitting pathway.

Together, these reports build on recent successes for the fusion industry in building out the legal infrastructure for the development and deployment of fusion technology, first in the demonstration phase and then at scale. Recent advances include the 2023 decision of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to regulate fusion technology separately from fission reactors,[1] passage of the 2024 ADVANCE Act codifying separate regulatory treatment of fusion machines as particle accelerators and simplifying disposal of the limited waste materials, and the growth of the Agreement State framework delegating NRC regulatory authority to states (39 at latest count) that wish to facilitate fusion development and deployment locally. Nevertheless, as both new reports emphasize, critical challenges remain.

Takeaways and Potential Opportunities and Challenges

Fusion energy is uniquely positioned at the nexus of both the opportunities and challenges of the 21st century. At a moment when the United States and China have entered a period of accelerating economic and technological competition over everything from AI to critical minerals, the prospect of near-term commercial-scale fusion energy is both shaped by and instrumental in shaping those broader trends. China’s dominant position in the supply chain for components critical to fusion technology, such as tungsten, vanadium, and rare earth elements, render the U.S. fusion industry vulnerable to a protracted trade war. At the same time, even as AI models may help fusion developers solve their remaining technical challenges, the prospect of stable, plentiful energy from commercial fusion machines could help technology companies meet their rapidly expanding energy demand to service data centers and AI infrastructure.

Moreover, fusion plants seem like a nearly ideal fit for large load centers like factories and data centers. Fusion plants will have relatively small footprints and can be sited close to demand centers (unlike renewable energy, which is limited by resource availability, and without the safety concerns popularly associated with nuclear fission). This means that reliance on long-distance, high-voltage transmission lines, which have themselves become a major bottleneck for energy development, can be minimized. Even so, grid interconnection and queue timelines remain a critical choke point for fusion buildout. State and federal lawmakers should take steps to allow behind-the-meter sales to focus early fusion commercialization where demand is highest. And states and transmission providers should consider exempting fusion projects from multi-year queues, given the overarching desirability of clean, safe, stable baseload. In many states, there may be potential to reuse transmission and other infrastructure from closing fossil fuel plants to accelerate the siting of fusion facilities.

The NRC is currently crafting a new regulatory framework under 10 CFR Part 30 for licensing the disposal of byproduct materials for approved fusion machine technologies. Final rules are expected in November and will provide another strong signal as to whether regulators are approaching fusion development with the necessary flexibility and creativity.

One point of notable optimism for fusion development is the bipartisanship of support for the technology. Tax credits for fusion that were championed by the Biden administration in the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, such as 45Y and 48E credits, were all retained by the Trump administration in its One Big Beautiful Bill Act, standing in contrast to other forms of clean energy. Although competition with China may pose challenges to supply chains and create risk of intellectual property theft, as seen in the AI field, this may nevertheless help to preserve broad government support domestically through a period when the emerging private sector needs broad, stable, and innovative regulatory, financial, and scientific support.

Most fusion projects also are unlikely to require review under the National Environmental Policy Act unless they are situated on federal land or heavily reliant on federal funding or loan guarantees. Nevertheless, reducing the overall timeline for other state and federal environmental permits remains a critical unresolved issue. States seeking to become innovation hubs for this potentially game-changing technology would be well advised to think proactively about how to implement smooth, rapid permitting regimes going forward.

Investors can position themselves for success by integrating flexible assets and adopting a resilience-focused strategy that anticipates market swings.","Andrew Warrell, is a partner, Spencer Holmes is an associate partner, and Tyler Bowen is an expert at McKinsey & Company.

Renewable energy is transforming the U.S. power market, which is set to grow from 25% to 45% of total generation by 2030. This rapid expansion, while crucial for a low-carbon future, brings new dynamics for investors to navigate — particularly around price volatility.

Solar and wind power, driven by variable weather patterns, can create differences between forecasted and actual output, leading to major price gaps in day-ahead versus real-time markets. For renewable-heavy portfolios, managing this variability is key to ensure stable, resilient returns.

Additionally, demand mismatches exacerbate this volatility. Solar production peaks around midday, often when demand is low, and tapers off in the evening when demand rises. In states like California, where solar comprises a large share of power, this mismatch can lead to significant daily price swings. Adding to the challenge, many renewable assets are located far from demand centers, leading to locational price differences which can reduce profit margins.

Contrastingly, renewable generation can exceed demand at times of extreme wind or sunshine, leading to price drops that reduce revenues when output is at peak. For renewable-heavy portfolios, this “oversupply effect” underscores the need for stabilizing factors to secure a steady stream of revenue.

Flexible assets as a stabilizer

To counteract renewable energy source-driven volatility, flexible assets have become a remedy in managing supply-demand imbalances and stabilizing returns. Battery storage, gas generation and demand response are leading solutions, helping portfolios remain resilient in increasingly volatile markets.

Battery storage capacity in the U.S. is expected to increase from 13 GW today to 110 GW by 2030, marking an eightfold growth as investors respond to stronger demand for higher storage capabilities. Batteries allow excess energy to be stored when prices are low and released during peak demand — creating new revenue opportunities and reducing exposure in lower-price periods. With their ability to quickly respond to price fluctuations, batteries are becoming an essential asset for stabilizing returns.

Gas generation remains a reliable option for on-demand power supply. While gas comprises 43% of U.S. power generation, some investors weigh its carbon footprint against its role in stabilizing portfolios exposed to renewables. Gas plants can quickly adjust output, ensuring reliable power when renewable generation falls short, offering a hedge against price instability.

Demand response programs have experienced rising participation, providing grid operators with the ability to incentivize consumers to lower usage during peak periods. Demand response now represents around 60 GW of capacity nationwide, helping to ease strain on the grid without requiring new infrastructure. For investors, it offers a flexible and sustainable way to balance renewable variability, enabling a dynamic approach to managing portfolio risk.

Together, battery storage, gas generation and demand response provide a crucial buffer against the risks associated with renewable energy, making portfolios more adaptable and financially resilient.

A strategic approach to building resilient portfolios

In addition to integrating flexible assets, a multi-pronged strategy is essential for long-term stability in renewable-heavy portfolios. Acquiring flexible capacity through M&A can add resilience to existing investments. By investing in established battery storage facilities or demand response assets, investors gain immediate capacity and increased control over risk, without the lengthy timelines typically needed for new energy infrastructure projects.

Integrated financial modeling allows investors to take a portfolio-wide view of potential risks and returns. By simulating how flexible assets and financial hedges perform under different market conditions, investors can optimize for risk-adjusted returns, structuring portfolios that strike a balance between risk appetite and stability.

Future-proofing for a renewable future

As renewable energy reshapes the power landscape, volatility will remain a defining characteristic of renewable-heavy portfolios. Investors can position themselves for success by integrating flexible assets and adopting a resilience-focused strategy that anticipates market swings.

With flexible assets and a proactive approach to risk management, investors can capture the promise of renewables while maintaining the stability needed for consistent returns. In this evolving energy landscape, such strategies are essential for securing long-term growth and safeguarding portfolio resilience.",https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/industries/energy%20and%20materials/our%20insights/blog/mitigating%20price%20volatility/mitigating-price-volatility.jpeg,N,,2025-10-28 04:59:11.843194

Within this total, 887 GW came from solar energy and another 521 GW from wind, with additional projects already underway.
Southeast Asia, in particular, has emerged as a primary destination, absorbing more than 31 percent of China’s total renewable energy investments abroad.
Subsidies and Surplus: China’s Engine Room China’s green industrial ascent did not emerge from spontaneous market efficiency but from deliberate and sustained state intervention.
This overcapacity posed a risk to the financial stability of China’s renewable energy sector, as producers grappled with reduced profitability due to oversupply.","Many observers praised China’s pledge to peak its carbon emissions by 2030 and reach carbon neutrality by 2060 as a historic commitment for global climate governance. However, much less attention was given to what was happening within the nation’s own industrial machinery. China’s renewable energy industry has expanded so quickly after 20 years of state-driven growth that it now faces the paradox of its own success.

China’s installed renewable capacity reached an astounding 3,348 gigawatts (GW) by 2024, surpassing the combined electricity generation of Europe and the United States. Within this total, 887 GW came from solar energy and another 521 GW from wind, with additional projects already underway. The country’s manufacturing output, however, far outpaces domestic demand: its factories are capable of producing over 861 GW of solar modules annually, a volume that the national grid cannot yet absorb.

This remarkable industrial scale-up has produced what might be described as a green surplus: an abundance of renewable technologies that the domestic system struggles to utilize efficiently. Grid bottlenecks, curtailment rates reaching up to 9 percent in certain provinces, and sluggish demand have left entire inventories of solar panels warehoused and idle. What appears on the surface as a technical challenge is, in essence, a political economy dilemma. When the world’s largest producer of green technology can no longer sell its output at home, the question arises: where does this surplus go?

From Domestic Boom to Global Spillover

China has gradually turned its excess production into an outward-oriented development strategy that exports goods and its institutional model of green industrialization over the past decade. The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) are financing this transnational expansion by directing capital and equipment to the Global South.

In this process, China is effectively undergoing what some scholars have called a “second industrial revolution.” The first revolution internationalized the production of steel and cement; the second sends out solar modules, wind turbines, and battery systems.

According to the “China’s Global Power” database, over 68 percent of China’s overseas generation capacity investments were directed toward solar and wind renewable energy projects by 2022-2023. Southeast Asia, in particular, has emerged as a primary destination, absorbing more than 31 percent of China’s total renewable energy investments abroad. Over the past decade, China has led public clean energy investment, contributing more than $2.7 billion into ASEAN clean energy markets.

At the center of this regional transformation lies Indonesia.

Indonesia: The Perfect Outlet

With more than 278 million people scattered across 17,000 islands, Indonesia offers both a massive energy market and a logistical maze. Under the National Electricity Master Plan (RUKN), electricity demand in Indonesia is projected to increase almost four times in the next 35 years – from 482 terawatt-hours (TWh) in 2024 to almost 1,813 TWh by 2060. For China, that’s precisely the kind of growing market its renewable surplus needs: resource-rich, rapidly urbanizing, and still building the power systems that much of the developed world already takes for granted.

Jakarta’s ambitions match the moment. The government has pledged to achieve net-zero emissions by 2060 and aims for 52 percent of its energy mix to come from renewables by 2044. Yet structural constraints persist. The country’s grid remains outdated, domestic financing is limited, and its solar manufacturing capacity, barely exceeding 1 GW annually, cannot possibly meet future demand on its own.

Against this backdrop, Chinese engagement has intensified. The two nations inked 11 agreements totaling $12.6 billion in 2023 alone, the majority of which had to do with electric vehicles and renewable energy. This degree of collaboration has never been seen in Indonesia’s power industry.

A case in point is the Cirata Floating Solar Power Plant, the largest of its kind in Southeast Asia. The project – built by PowerChina and Indonesia’s state utility Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN), with a U$100 million loan from the China Development Bank – went online in 2023. It now adds 145 megawatts (MW) to the grid, enough to supply about 50,000 homes and reduce carbon emissions by more than 200,000 tons a year.

China’s presence extends beyond solar infrastructure. The State Grid Corporation of China (SGCC) has partnered with PLN to modernize Indonesia’s transmission network, including ambitious plans for high-voltage direct current (HVDC) interconnections linking Java, Sumatra, and Kalimantan. Meanwhile, in Sulawesi, Chinese investment exceeding $30 billion in nickel downstream processing has transformed the region into a global hub for electric vehicle battery production.

Taken together, these ventures are redrawing Asia’s energy map. Capital, technology, and industrial know-how now move southward, from China to its developing neighbors. It’s a kind of globalization that feels different from the one led by the West: faster, more state-directed, and, in some ways, more pragmatic. Yet beneath the cooperation lies a new kind of interdependence that Indonesia will have to manage carefully.

Subsidies and Surplus: China’s Engine Room

China’s green industrial ascent did not emerge from spontaneous market efficiency but from deliberate and sustained state intervention. The 2009 amendment to the 2006 Renewable Energy Law expanded the government’s capacity to guarantee grid access, subsidize producers, and regulate pricing. Between 2019 and 2022, the government spent roughly $237 billion supporting its green industries – around 1.7 percent of China’s GDP.

This policy muscle created global champions. BYD, now one of the world’s top electric-vehicle makers, received 2.1 billion euros in subsidies in 2022—ten times what it got just two years earlier. Mingyang Smart Energy, a key wind-turbine manufacturer, saw its support climb from 20 million euros to 52 million over the same period. Such backing helped drive down the cost of solar modules by more than 80 percent in just a decade.

But this success also bred new challenges. When the United States and the European Union imposed tariffs on Chinese solar exports in the 2010s, accusing Beijing of undercutting global prices, domestic markets became the fallback. For a while, massive homegrown investment kept factories busy. The Chinese government, through the National Energy Administration (NEA), implemented policies that encouraged state-owned enterprises to rapidly construct solar plants, wind farms, and related infrastructure. By 2022, China had installed over 392 GW of solar capacity, making it the largest solar market in the world.

However, while subsidies and tax credits spurred rapid expansion, they were not effectively aligned with market demand. As a result, production continued to grow even as demand declined, leading to a supply glut that negatively impacted both profitability and sector stability. As the domestic market struggled to absorb the excess production, Chinese manufacturers faced shrinking margins and declining profits, particularly as global demand weakened. This overcapacity posed a risk to the financial stability of China’s renewable energy sector, as producers grappled with reduced profitability due to oversupply.

In response, China redirected its strategy outward, transforming surplus production into the raw material of foreign policy. By exporting its green technologies through concessional loans and state-backed enterprises, China effectively converted its internal accumulation crisis into a global opportunity. The green surplus, in this sense, became not merely an economic outcome but a geopolitical instrument.

How the Outflow Works

China’s export of clean energy infrastructure follows a clear pattern. Policy banks such as the China Development Bank and the Export–Import Bank of China offer long-term, low-interest loans to developing countries for renewable energy projects. These loans are often “tied,” meaning that recipient nations must purchase Chinese-made equipment and contract Chinese firms for construction and maintenance.

The arrangement solves two problems at once. It helps Beijing manage its domestic oversupply of solar panels, turbines, and batteries, while allowing partner countries to access affordable technology and financing they could not otherwise secure. But the benefits come with strings attached: by relying heavily on Chinese capital and technology, recipient economies become more closely integrated into China’s industrial and financial ecosystem.

Indonesia illustrates both sides of this dynamic. The country’s infrastructure has expanded rapidly with Chinese funding, creating jobs and lowering the cost of renewable technology. Yet, this progress has deepened financial exposure. By 2024, PLN’s long-term liabilities had climbed to 539.16 trillion Indonesian rupiah (roughly $34.6 billion), much of it denominated in foreign currency. If energy demand softens or the rupiah weakens, those loans could become a heavy weight on the state utility’s balance sheet.

Local manufacturing also remains heavily dependent on imports. Even after the success of the Cirata solar project, Indonesia still sources most of its wafers, inverters, and modules from China. The pattern is even clearer in the nickel sector, where Chinese companies dominate the production chain – from high-pressure acid leaching (HPAL) technology to the export of key battery precursors such as nickel-cobalt-manganese compounds. Indonesia provides the raw material, but most of the value is captured elsewhere.

Debt, Risk, and Green Contradictions

Officials in Jakarta seldom use the word dependence. Partnership sounds far better. Yet the data hint at a more complicated reality. Indonesia’s overall public debt, around 39.8 percent of GDP, looks comfortable, but energy-sector liabilities are swelling. Many power-purchase agreements financed through Chinese loans are pegged to the U.S. dollar, exposing PLN and the government to currency swings. If electricity growth underperforms, a plausible scenario given slower industrial uptake and energy-efficiency improvements, those debts could become a long-term fiscal burden for both the company and the state budget. In short, the same financial mechanisms that enable renewable expansion today could entrench structural dependency tomorrow.

While financing inflows have been abundant, grid readiness has lagged behind. Indonesia’s power system currently holds a reserve margin exceeding 40 percent in the Java–Bali and South Sulawesi systems. This excess, equivalent to roughly 6–7 GW of unutilized capacity, reflects years of over-planning under the 35 GW program and the continued dominance of coal baseload generation.

Variable renewable energy (VRE), especially solar and wind, struggles to connect to an infrastructure designed for centralized, fossil-based supply. Transmission bottlenecks and slow grid-code reform have led to curtailments even for operational projects, while new solar proposals in East Java and South Sulawesi risk being built ahead of demand growth. Without significant investment in transmission and storage, additional solar and wind capacity will likely be under-utilized, creating the very scenario PLN sought to avoid: stranded green assets that echo the idle coal plants of the last decade.

The mismatch between industrial geography and renewable project sites amplifies the risk of regional overcapacity on one side and persistent energy poverty on the other. Renewable tenders frequently concentrate in high-demand provinces with already congested grid access, rather than in areas with excess land and solar potential, due to the lack of full synchronization between PLN’s procurement plan (RUPTL) and regional development plans. Total electricity demand is expected to increase from 482 TWh in 2024 to 1,813 TWh by 2060, according to Indonesia’s National Electricity General Plan (RUKN). However, the growth will be unevenly distributed, with Java–Bali continuing to dominate demand and the eastern regions remaining undersupplied.

Beyond the numbers, social tensions are also emerging. In Sulawesi, where most of Indonesia’s nickel downstreaming and battery projects are located, local communities have reported groundwater contamination, shrinking farmland, and air pollution from nickel-processing zones such as Morowali and Weda Bay. Land acquisitions have often proceeded with little consultation, sowing resentment among local communities. In parts of Central Java, disputes over compensation have slowed the development of solar farms, exposing gaps in regulation and weak protection for smallholders. For many, the clean-energy transition has arrived not as empowerment but as disruption.

These overlapping pressures – financial, infrastructural, and social – point to a deeper paradox. Indonesia’s renewable expansion is greening the grid, but it is doing so through mechanisms that replicate older hierarchies of dependence: dollar-denominated debt, imported technology, and uneven access to land and benefit.

China’s Growing Green Leverage

China’s ability to finance and execute renewable projects at scale has given it a commanding role in shaping the energy future of Asia. While Western-led initiatives such as the G-7’s Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP) have made bold pledges, $20 billion for Indonesia among them, progress has been slow. Only a fraction of that amount has actually reached project sites. China, by contrast, moves quickly. Its financing carries fewer political conditions and usually arrives packaged with equipment, expertise, and on-the-ground execution.

This agility gives Beijing a decisive advantage. Through its state banks and corporations, China has positioned itself as the lender, builder, and standard-setter of Asia’s clean energy boom. By financing large-scale renewable projects, such as solar and wind farms in developing countries, China ensures that these countries become dependent on its technology and financial support. This dependence grants China significant leverage over their political and economic policies.

China’s domination of global supply chains in green technologies, particularly in lithium-ion batteries and solar panels, is a central element of its broader geopolitical strategy. This control spans all stages of the supply chain, from the extraction of raw materials such as lithium and cobalt to the large-scale production of solar panels and battery components. By controlling these critical sectors, China gains significant leverage over global renewable energy markets and the countries that rely on its technologies for their clean energy transitions.

Countries that rely on Chinese funding often find themselves aligning, intentionally or not, with Beijing’s technical and regulatory preferences. By exporting not only hardware but also technical standards, from grid codes to inverter software, China quietly defines how regional power systems operate.

For many Southeast Asian governments, this arrangement remains acceptable for now. Affordable and reliable electricity takes precedence over strategic autonomy, especially when domestic budgets are stretched thin. Yet as the region’s dependence on Chinese capital deepens, so too does Beijing’s ability to translate economic cooperation into geopolitical leverage. In this emerging “green order,” technological dominance begins to resemble a new form of influence, one that shapes power relations without territorial control.

From Carbon Neutrality to Power Neutrality

China’s rise as a clean energy giant is reshaping the global economy faster than any previous industrial shift. But it also reveals how the old habits of growth and control persist beneath the surface of the new low-carbon age. Solar panels and wind turbines may be replacing coal and oil, but the logic remains familiar: overproduction at home, surplus seeking markets abroad.

For Indonesia, this duality is both a blessing and a warning. The country gains infrastructure, investment, and access to cutting-edge technology, yet risks deepening financial and technological dependence. The real test lies not in the number of megawatts installed, but in whether Indonesia can turn this wave of green capital into lasting, self-sustaining progress.

For Beijing, leadership in the energy transition will eventually require more than speed or scale. True leadership will mean sharing technology more openly, easing financial control, and allowing partners genuine room to grow. For Jakarta, success will depend on building resilience, ensuring the transition not only decarbonizes the economy but also democratizes power itself, in both the electrical and political sense.

Because ultimately, the global shift to clean energy is about more than just cutting emissions.

It’s a power plant with a data center attached to it and that is not what we agreed to,” Carrier said.
The city’s appeal seeks to block a 73-megawatt on-site fuel cell system to power the Amazon data center under construction on Scioto Darby Road.
The proposed fuel cells at the data center, as many as 228, would be the largest in the United States and the second-largest in the world.","The City of Hilliard intends to appeal a decision by the Ohio Environmental Protection agency to issue a permit to install fuel cells at the Amazon data center on Scioto-Darby Road.

City Councilwoman Emily Cole and other council members acknowledged that the city is facing a potentially expensive and uphill battle in filing the appeal as it will seek to challenge Ohio Revised Code established to give utilities, in certain conditions, the autonomy to proceed without local oversight.

Council’s action on Oct. 27 was in reaction to American Electric Power, owners of the natural-gas powered fuel cells, withdrawing an application before the city’s planning and zoning commission, citing that the Ohio Power Siting Board (OPSB), a division of the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO), has the sole authority to approve the fuel cells.

“Just because we may not win, does not mean we don’t try. There are some fights that are worth taking, particularly when we are fighting for our families, our friends, our neighbors, and our community. I believe this is one of those fights, and I’m willing to go down swinging,” Cole said.

City Council, in a unanimous vote, directed Acting City Manager Dan Ralley, through the city’s law director, Thad Boggs, to file the appeal.

Boggs said the appeal must be filed by Nov. 7, or within 30 days of the Ohio EPA issuing the permit to install.

The appeal process would play out internally within the Ohio EPA but after a finding either party would have the option to appeal to a court of law, according to Boggs.

Nine residents spoke in opposition to the installation of fuel cells at the data center.

Councilman Les Carrier called for the city to look into whether Amazon is correctly calculating the net profit taxes it owes the city and whether the city could rescind tax abatement agreements it has with Amazon because the site plan on which it was based when approved is being amended to allow for the on-site fuel cells.

“They haven’t acted in good faith. It’s not a data center. It’s a power plant with a data center attached to it and that is not what we agreed to,” Carrier said.

Carrier also questioned whether Boggs, an attorney at Frost Brown Todd, could effectively represent the city because of corporate clients that other attorneys at Frost Brown Todd represent.

Councilwoman Cynthia Vermillion also asked whether the city could use alternate outside council that are experts in representing residents or consumers challenging the actions of corporations and utilities.

Boggs indicated that at the direction of City Council, he would file an appeal by Nov. 7 but that he would discuss with Ralley options for alternate representation for the appeal process.

The city’s appeal seeks to block a 73-megawatt on-site fuel cell system to power the Amazon data center under construction on Scioto Darby Road.

Speaking in reaction to AEP’s withdrawal of an application to the city’s planning and zoning commission to install the fuel cells, Ralley said the city is “disappointed to not have the opportunity to formally review the project as we would with almost all other new development projects in Hilliard.”

The Planning and Zoning Commission first considered the case Oct. 9 but tabled it until Nov. 13 to further consider how the Ohio EPA or other entities might monitor the site after it is operational, but AEP notified the city Oct. 21 it was withdrawing the application and did not require any consideration from the planning and zoning commission.

“These are the types of issues that should be addressed at the local level. It is regrettable that state lawmakers have overridden local oversight, particularly since this technology is unfamiliar and new not just to our city, but also the entire state,” Ralley said.

Ralley is referring to Section 4906.13(B) of Ohio Revised Code, stipulating that the Ohio Power Siting Board has the sole authority to consider Amazon’s proposal for fuel cells.

FOOT OFF THE GAS: California officials are still riding high on the back of record-breaking electric vehicle sales — but the post-EV-incentive hangover is about to set in.

The Trump administration’s shredding of former President Joe Biden’s EV playbook — most notably the $7,500 federal tax credit for drivers — catalyzed a wave of purchases ahead of the Oct. 1 expiration date, resulting in a quarter where nearly 30 percent of all cars sold in California were battery-electric and plug-in hybrid.

Gov. Gavin Newsom is taking the rare win in a brutal year for EV policy, including Republicans’ rollback of the state’s EV sales mandate and plateauing EV market share.

“We’re setting new records because this state believes in innovation, not isolation,” Newsom said earlier this month after the state released sales data for July through September.

That victory lap is likely to be short-lived, though.

A J.D. Power market analysis released Thursday projected that EVs will represent just 5 percent of new car sales nationally in October, a nearly 60 percent plunge from September and a 40 percent drop compared to the same month last year.

And while California has by far the largest and most mature EV market in the nation, auto industry experts say the state isn’t immune to larger market shifts.

“Sales will decline in the short run for sure,” said Gil Tal, director of the University of California, Davis’ EV Research Center. “That’s pretty clear — we saw a lot of sales in September and we’ll see fewer the rest of the year.”

Meanwhile, the two major U.S. automakers — Ford and General Motors — said in earnings reports and calls last week that they’re planning to build more gas-powered pickup trucks and SUVs to make up for projected losses in their EV businesses.

“I think it’s going to be a vibrant industry, but it’s going to be smaller, way smaller than we thought,” Ford CEO Jim Farley said at an event a day before the federal EV tax incentive expired.

Car dealers say they’re already seeing the impact on the ground. Jessie Dosanjh, president of the California Automotive Retailing Group, said he’s seen a dramatic decrease in traffic online and at his 17 showrooms during October, and that he’s expecting a lower supply of EV models in the coming years. His dealerships represent 11 brands, including Chevrolet, Ford and Hyundai, which have all made major investments in EVs and battery manufacturing.

“They have to be profitable at the end of the day,” Dosanjh said of the automakers. “So I do see reduced EV production, and the ones that are produced are probably going to be cheaper.”

Market analysts say that despite the headwinds, the long-term trajectory of the American auto industry is still trending towards EVs. Jessica Caldwell, head of insights at automotive research firm Edmunds, said that while companies are rethinking how aggressively they’ll push the technology, they’re still rolling out new models and competing over pricing.

Hyundai announced plans earlier this month to slash the price of its popular Ionic 5 by $9,800, while Ford, GM and Tesla are all dropping prices or rolling out cheaper models.

“Automakers are committed to electric vehicles, so it’s not as if they’re going away,” Caldwell said. “I think all this means is that the timeline to get to a majority mix of electrified vehicles is just going to be a bit slower.”

California’s tools to speed up that timeline are limited in the face of Trump’s assaults on state policy and a looming budget deficit that has already forced Newsom to back away from his commitment to backfill the federal incentives.

State regulators launched rulemaking last week on new vehicle emissions standards — including the possibility of reviving an EV sales mandate — that they hope to complete by summer 2027. But those rules wouldn’t be submitted for the federal approval needed to enforce them until 2029 — if a Democrat wins the 2028 presidential election.

Even without sticks, EV advocates say they still have a trump card — the looming Chinese EV market behemoth. Chinese companies like BYD have rapidly grown into the world’s largest EV manufacturers, and while high tariffs have kept them out of the U.S. market, even American auto executives admit they pose an existential threat.

“The Chinese make 30 million cars a year, and they could make 50 million if they could find a market for them,” said Mike Murphy, a veteran Republican consultant who founded a nonprofit that supports increased electric vehicle adoption. “If we want to have an auto industry, we have to figure out how to compete in EVs.” — AN

DON’T MAKE ME SAY IT: An oil giant is taking California to court.

Exxon Mobil sued the state on Friday over its first-in-the-nation climate disclosure laws, reports Lesley Clark for POLITICO’s E&E News. The corporation is arguing that the new rules will force them to use frameworks that disproportionately blame large companies for climate change.

“California may believe that companies that meet the statutes’ revenue thresholds are uniquely responsible for climate change; but the First Amendment categorically bars it from forcing ExxonMobil to speak in service of that misguided viewpoint,” the company wrote in its suit.

SB 253, the first bill the firm is taking umbrage with, would require corporations with at least $1 billion in revenue to report carbon emissions across their supply chains beginning in June 2026, according to draft guidelines. Its companion measure, SB 261,would require businesses with revenues of more than $500 million to disclose climate-related financial risks starting in January.

The California Air Resources Board is expected to finalize the disclosure rulemaking early next year

Last year, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce filed a suit similarly arguing First Amendment infringement. That litigation has failed to block the rulemaking process and an appeal is pending in the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.

Newsom’s office pointed to that ongoing court case to defend the laws.

“Truly shocking that one of the biggest polluters on the planet would be opposed to transparency,” said Tara Gallegos, a spokesperson for the governor. “These laws have already been upheld in court and we continue to have confidence in them.” — LC, NB

REFLECTION SEASON: Dozens of conservation and environmental justice groups are looking back on this year’s legislative session — and not liking what they’re seeing.

“Under the guise of ‘affordability’ and ‘abundance,’ you enacted the most regressive policies in generations,” the groups, including the Center on Race, Poverty & the Environment, the Central Valley Air Quality Coalition and the Leadership Counsel on Justice & Accountability Action, wrote to Newsom and the Legislature in a letter on Monday.

They called out in particular this year’s passage of SB 131, which overhauled the California Environmental Quality Act in the name of building more housing, and SB 237, which cleared the way for more oil drilling in Kern County. — CvK

MILKING IT: A historic $40 million settlement with environmental groups in January was supposed to mark the end of most cattle and dairy farms in Point Reyes National Seashore. But it didn’t stop Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. from getting involved, Heather Richards reports for POLITICO’s E&E News.

Kennedy has told people he’s enlisted Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, who’s dispatched Wyoming lawyer and Interior political appointee Karen Budd-Falen to broker a Point Reyes solution.

It’s unclear what exactly the team could do. Most of the ranchers in the settlement have already closed operations and moved away. And some of them have sent a letter to GOP lawmakers investigating the settlement asking them to back down, calling the agreement the only “viable option” after years of litigation and uncertainty.

But the fight seems tailor-made for Kennedy’s “Make America Healthy Again” agenda, which in part emphasizes small farms and weaning people off processed foods, something that also resonates deeply in Marin County. He got involved after appeals from one of the region’s pioneering organic dairy farmers, Albert Straus, and a wellness influencer named Chadwick Conover.

“It was the first glimmer of hope that I had that we could do something,” Straus said of Kennedy’s interest. — HR, CvK

BUMPY ROAD: Rivian’s announcement last week that it plans to lay off more than 600 workers was the latest blow in a year of bad news for the Irvine-based company.

The luxury electric SUV and truck maker has failed to replicate its 2024 quarterly sales at any point this year, according to data from the California New Car Dealers Association. Rivian’s sales through September are 3 percent lower compared to the same period last year, even with the sales boost driven by the expiring federal incentives.

After the Asian nation announced export controls earlier this year, Scott Dunn , Noveon’s co-founder, found himself inundated with calls.

“Not only were we being asked to do what we had planned, we were asked to increase those volumes for what was planned by multiples,"" said Dunn, whose company has inked deals with customers from carmaker General Motors Co. to automation company ABB LtdBloomberg Terminal.

China, which produces the bulk of rare earths globally, unveiled supply curbs in April in response to a barrage of tariffs imposed by Washington. It outlined plans to expand the curbs this month, including by requiring overseas shippers of items that contain even small amounts of certain rare earths to have an export license. The fate of those measures remains unclear after US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said he expects China to offer a deferral of its curbs to seal a trade deal. President Donald Trump and his counterpart Xi Jinping are set to meet for trade talks later this week, and rare earths will be on the agenda

Whatever happens, industry is betting the world won't want to go back to one supplier. Conversations with more than a dozen rare-earth executives and industry veterans describe a commercial landscape that is nascent but rapidly transforming as investor interest surges and governments — especially the US — launch more meaningful efforts to build a non-China supply chain.",https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/i5FUnBFSMll8/v1/1200x901.jpg,N,,2025-10-27 23:17:29.560994

Google and NextEra Energy sign a 25-year agreement for Duane Arnold’s energy, as well as an agreement to explore deployment of nuclear generation nationwide

JUNO BEACH, Fla., and MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif., Oct. 27, 2025 /PRNewswire/ — NextEra Energy today announced two transformative agreements with Google, which will strengthen U.S. nuclear leadership and help meet growing energy demand from artificial intelligence (AI) with clean, reliable nuclear energy.

The cornerstone of this collaboration is the planned restart of the Duane Arnold Energy Center (Duane Arnold), Iowa’s only nuclear facility, which is located in Palo, near Cedar Rapids. Once operational, Google will purchase power from the 615-MW plant as a 24/7 carbon-free energy source to help power Google’s growing cloud and AI infrastructure in Iowa, while also strengthening local grid reliability, creating thousands of direct and indirect jobs, and driving significant economic investment to the Midwest region.

In addition to Google’s 25-year agreement to purchase carbon-free nuclear energy from the Duane Arnold plant, one of the plant’s current minority owners, Central Iowa Power Cooperative (CIPCO), will purchase the remaining portion of the plant’s output on the same terms as Google. NextEra Energy has signed definitive agreements to acquire CIPCO and Corn Belt Power Cooperative’s combined 30% interest in the plant, which will bring NextEra Energy’s ownership to 100%. Duane Arnold, which was shut down in 2020, is expected to be online and delivering electricity onto the grid by the first quarter of 2029, pending regulatory approvals to restart the plant.

Powering AI growth

As the U.S. enters a new era of innovation and opportunity driven by AI, this strategic collaboration aims to enable Google to grow its business needs responsibly. The power purchase agreement with Google enables the investment to restart the plant and covers costs for the production of energy from Duane Arnold. Restarting the plant will increase generation capacity for the region, and energy customers in Iowa will not bear any costs associated with the power Google purchases from the facility. NextEra Energy’s strategic investments in nuclear and advanced generation help position Google to deploy AI that can grow the American economy, create jobs, accelerate scientific advances, improve health and educational outcomes, and strengthen national and global security.

To that end, NextEra Energy and Google have also signed an agreement to explore the development of new nuclear generation to be deployed in the U.S., which would help power America’s growing electricity needs.

Chinese automaker Chery recently claimed 808-mile range with a solid-state battery prototype boasting 600 watt-hours per kilogram energy density, targeting 2027 production.
Toyota, leveraging partnerships with Sumitomo Metal Mining, aims for solid-state production as early as fiscal year 2027.
Nissan instead turned to Ford-SK for U.S. battery supply and now LiCAP for solid-state technology.","Nissan has developed prototype solid-state battery cells that promise to double driving range while cutting charging times in half compared to current lithium-ion batteries. The Japanese automaker achieved these performance targets through a partnership with U.S.-based LiCAP Technologies, marking a critical milestone in next-generation EV battery development—even as the company bleeds billions and shutters factories worldwide.

This isn’t just another battery announcement. It’s a technological lifeline thrown by a drowning automaker that’s betting its future on 2028 production targets while simultaneously slashing 20,000 jobs and selling off assets to survive the present.

Revolutionary Battery Technology With Desperate Timing

Nissan’s prototype all-solid-state battery cells have now reached performance benchmarks that could fundamentally reshape the EV market. The breakthrough builds on Nissan’s partnership with LiCAP Technologies, announced in August 2025, which focuses on developing a revolutionary “dry electrode” production process that eliminates the expensive, time-consuming wet-coating method used in conventional battery manufacturing.

Testing at Nissan’s advanced facilities in Japan and the United States has validated the technology’s potential. The automaker reports the new battery design achieves a significant jump in energy density and thermal efficiency, allowing vehicles to travel substantially farther between charges while reducing charging downtime to levels approaching gasoline refueling convenience.

Manufacturing Innovation Targets Cost Reduction

The key to Nissan’s confidence lies in LiCAP’s proprietary Activated Dry Electrode technology, which transforms how battery electrodes are produced. Traditional wet-coating involves mixing active materials with solvents, coating them onto collectors, then drying them in high-temperature ovens—a process that consumes massive energy and time. LiCAP’s dry process uses raw material powder applied directly to current collectors and flattened with roll presses, cutting production steps while reducing environmental impact.

This manufacturing efficiency is critical for Nissan’s ambitious cost targets. The company aims to achieve $75 per kilowatt-hour for battery packs, significantly below 2024’s industry average of $115 per kWh. Reaching that price point would make EVs competitive with gasoline vehicles on sticker price alone, eliminating one of the biggest barriers to mass adoption.

Nissan opened its all-solid-state battery pilot production line at its Yokohama plant in January 2025. The facility serves as a proving ground for scaling the technology from laboratory prototypes to mass-production-ready processes, testing everything from electrode manufacturing to cell assembly and quality control.

Production Timeline Faces Competitive Pressure

Nissan has committed to launching its first EVs equipped with in-house developed solid-state batteries by fiscal year 2028. While this represents an aggressive timeline for bringing revolutionary technology to market, the company faces fierce competition from rivals pursuing the same holy grail of EV batteries.

Chinese automaker Chery recently claimed 808-mile range with a solid-state battery prototype boasting 600 watt-hours per kilogram energy density, targeting 2027 production. Stellantis and Factorial validated 375 Wh/kg cells that charge from 15% to 90% in just 18 minutes, planning demonstration fleets by 2026. Toyota, leveraging partnerships with Sumitomo Metal Mining, aims for solid-state production as early as fiscal year 2027.

Perhaps most threatening: Chinese battery giants CATL and BYD, which control 55% of global battery sales, are both targeting solid-state launches around 2027. These companies possess the manufacturing scale and supply chain dominance that Japanese automakers like Nissan lost years ago.

Real-World Applications Still Speculative

While Nissan hasn’t confirmed which models will debut the new battery technology, industry speculation points toward future versions of the Ariya crossover or the company’s next compact EV platform. If performance claims hold up in real-world testing, EVs built with this technology could deliver more than 600 miles of range while recharging in less than half an hour—specifications that would reignite interest in Nissan’s performance sub-brands and potentially position the automaker as a frontrunner in the electric market.

The company’s investment into advanced battery chemistries reflects its broader push to align electric performance with affordability, longevity, and mass scalability. This approach mirrors global trends where automakers are pooling resources to overcome the cost and complexity of energy storage innovation.

EVXL’s Take

The timing of this announcement is almost comically tragic. Here’s Nissan, trumpeting a battery breakthrough that could revolutionize EVs by 2028, while simultaneously fighting for survival in 2025.

Let’s connect the dots from our recent coverage: In May, we reported that Nissan slashed 20,000 jobs and closed seven assembly plants after posting a $4.48 billion loss. The same month, the company announced plans to sell its $700 million Yokohama headquarters specifically to raise capital for “next-generation battery technology.” In July, Nissan shut down the historic Oppama plant that built the original Leaf—the vehicle that made Nissan an EV pioneer in 2010.

The company’s desperation shows in its scramble for partners. After merger talks with Honda collapsed in February, Toyota reportedly reached out—but nothing materialized. Nissan instead turned to Ford-SK for U.S. battery supply and now LiCAP for solid-state technology. This isn’t strategic collaboration—it’s survival mode.

The real question isn’t whether solid-state batteries work. We’ve seen impressive claims from Stellantis, Mercedes, and Chinese manufacturers. The question is whether Nissan can survive until 2028 to bring this technology to market. With Chinese competitors like Chery and BYD targeting 2027 production and controlling over half of global battery sales, Nissan’s three-year timeline might as well be a decade.

This announcement feels less like innovation leadership and more like a press release designed to reassure nervous investors that there’s still a plan. The technology is real, the partnership with LiCAP is legitimate, and the 2028 target might even be achievable. But none of that matters if the company runs out of cash before the breakthrough reaches production.

Despite having more than three years to develop and publish comprehensive guidance, Treasury has so far failed to do so.
“To date, the guidance issued by the Treasury Department has not addressed critical aspects of the 45Z credit, including how it can be claimed, validated, and ultimately monetized,” they continued.
“Many of these facilities have embraced innovation and are poised for further advancements if they are able to invest with long term clarity on the status of the 45Z credit.
“We urge the Treasury Department to take immediate action and finalize the rules to implement the Section 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit,” the lawmakers continued.","More than two dozen federal lawmakers on Oct. 20 sent a letter to U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent urging his agency to finalize guidance for the 45Z clean fuel production credit, as amended by the One Big Beautiful Bill earlier this year.

“The 45Z credit should be leveraged to increase our country's capacity to produce domestic renewable fuels, increase demand for domestic agriculture, and for the biofuel industry to make continued investment in expanding and improving their production capacity,” the lawmakers wrote. “At a time when farmers are struggling to find foreign market access for commodities, recurring domestic demand from the biofuels industry is more important than ever. The effective, timely, and scientific implementation of 45Z is essential to realize the credit's full potential.”

The letter stresses the importance of the updated credit’s feedstock provisions, which limit eligible feedstocks to those produced in North America. “It is vital Treasury ensures this intent is fully carried out in guidance, ensuring no loopholes are available to undermine the importance of the program for farmers,” the lawmakers wrote.

The 45Z credit was initially established by the Inflation Reduction Act, which was signed into law more than three years ago. Despite having more than three years to develop and publish comprehensive guidance, Treasury has so far failed to do so. “Continued delays in finalizing 45Z rules may risk hindering economic growth, innovation, and job creation across the nation,” the lawmakers wrote. “Now that Congress has acted to change the provision to make it even more closely tied with the economic success of the American farmer, it is more important than ever to get clarity the biofuels industry has been desperately seeking.

“To date, the guidance issued by the Treasury Department has not addressed critical aspects of the 45Z credit, including how it can be claimed, validated, and ultimately monetized,” they continued. “This lack of clarity has left capital stranded, stalling investments that are essential for fueling American jobs and strengthening our domestic energy sector. Furthermore, the current guidance excludes many existing producers of clean fuels who have already undergone the Environmental Protection Agency's rigorous processes under the Renewable Fuel Standard.”

The letter also notes that many U.S. facilities that produce clean fuels from waste streams current lack a clear pathway to access the 45Z credit. Any rulemaking by Treasury must include all eligible fuel producers sourcing domestic feedstocks who have made significant investments and are adding substantial value to our rural communities today,” the lawmakers wrote.

“The United States' biofuels industry contributes billions in commerce for American farmers,” they added. “Many of these facilities have embraced innovation and are poised for further advancements if they are able to invest with long term clarity on the status of the 45Z credit. Our country relies on a thriving agricultural, food, and renewable fuels sector to support our economy and communities, especially in current times where farmers are seeing a lack of demand while still experiencing extremely high input costs. Delays in finalizing these rules threaten this vital industry and undermine the intent of the law.

“We urge the Treasury Department to take immediate action and finalize the rules to implement the Section 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit,” the lawmakers continued. “Moreover, we strongly request that these rules provide a clear and understood path for all existing renewable fuels producers in the United States utilizing domestic feedstocks. If properly implemented, this credit can fully mobilize the biofuel industry, growing our domestic manufacturing base, creating jobs, diversifying the U.S. energy portfolio, adding value to crops grown by American farmers, and offering consumers better, more affordable, and lower carbon options at the fuel pump and in the skies.”

The RNG facility will capture and process landfill gas into RNG, providing a renewable, lower-carbon fuel alternative to diesel and conventional natural gas. The project marks a significant milestone for SJI, as it will be the first to deliver RNG into the pipeline system of South Jersey Gas, a subsidiary of SJI. The milestone event was attended by local and state elected officials, and company leadership.

“We are thrilled to cut the ribbon on this project, which signifies another milestone for SJI,” said Chet Benham, president, SJI Renewable Energy Ventures. “This project underscores our commitment to innovation and continuing efforts in renewable energy solutions.”

The RNG produced at the ACUA plant is planned to be used as transportation fuel and directly injected into the South Jersey Gas pipelines, offering RNG for the first time to supply energy to homes and businesses in the South Jersey Gas territory.

The facility is anticipated to have a nameplate capacity of 2,500 SCFM of landfill gas and is expected to produce more than 650,000 MMBtu, which is equivalent to nearly 4.6 million gallons of gas, per year of RNG.

“ACUA has consistently demonstrated its commitment to exploring and implementing technologies that transform waste into a resource and improve our environment,” said ACUA President Matthew DeNafo. “This project embodies that commitment, and we’re happy to celebrate its opening alongside our wonderful partners OPAL and SJI.”

Once operational, the RNG produced at the ACUA’s solid waste landfill is also expected to reduce methane emissions from the landfill and avoid over 346,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) per year.

“The opening of this facility marks an important milestone in OPAL Fuels’ mission of turning waste into clean, domestic energy,” said Adam Comora, Co-Chief Executive Officer of OPAL Fuels. “This project reduces emissions, improves local air quality, creates jobs, and strengthens American energy independence. As we drive forward with a focus on strategic growth and operational excellence, this project serves as an example of how landfills can benefit from producing RNG by generating financial value, cutting methane emissions, and displacing diesel to decarbonize transportation.”

The process is expected to reduce the volume of methane gas combusted at the facility, resulting in a reduction in on-site emissions. The RNG project represents the first collaboration between SJI and OPAL Fuels as part of their previously announced 50/50 joint venture to develop, construct, own and operate RNG facilities.

It’s just a shame the social media giant is also going big on gas plants in Louisiana to power its data centers at the same time.

The latest PPAs include ENGIE’s new 600-megawatt (MW) Swenson Ranch Solar project in Stonewall County, southeast of Lubbock. When it comes online in 2027, Swenson will become ENGIE’s largest solar farm within its 11 GW North American portfolio of solar, wind, and battery storage projects. Meta will buy 100% of Swenson’s power to run its US data centers.

ENGIE says the $900 million project will create over 350 construction jobs and generate over $158 million in tax revenue for Stonewall County and the local hospital district over its lifetime.

“Our objective is to bring reliable, cost-competitive power to the grid as rapidly as possible, and projects like Swenson demonstrate the importance of solar to meet the timely needs of our customers,” said Dave Carroll, ENGIE North America’s CEO and chief renewables officer.

Meta’s head of global energy, Urvi Parekh, said the expanded deal with ENGIE “enables us to continue matching 100% of our electricity use with clean and renewable energy to support our data center operations,” Parekh said.

Electrek’s Take

Meta isn’t exactly putting its money where its mouth is when it comes to matching 100% of its electricity use with clean energy. The social media giant is also building a $10 billion data center – one of the world’s largest – in Richland Parish, Louisiana, that’s going to be powered by three gas-powered plants, which utility Entergy will build especially for Meta, which is paying 50% of the costs. Those three plants will produce 2,262 MW of dirty fossil fuel power. For perspective, that’s nearly 10% of Entergy’s current energy capacity across four states.

So while the 1.3 GW of clean energy that ENGIE will produce in Texas for Meta is great, it doesn’t make up for the CO2 emissions it’s about to create with this dirty project it’s building in a lower-income farming community in Louisiana. It certainly isn’t for speed, because solar is the fastest to put up. Limited state oversight – and a 2024 state law that lets the company skip paying sales tax – likely helped Meta make that destructive decision.

Huge wins, with much more to come.” Spear said ATA’s most important initiative remaining in its crosshairs is EPA’s low-NOx rule.
“We outright oppose any federal rule that intentionally wipes out individual choice, crushes opportunities, and sidelines hundreds of thousands of truckers who move our economy,” said Spear.
“We don’t lack people with CDLs… what we lack is the number of qualified drivers who meet our high standards of professionalism and safety.
“The overwhelming majority of America’s 3.6 million professional truck drivers take immense pride in their work,” Spear continued.","Against the backdrop of a three-year-long freight recession, American Trucking Associations’ President and CEO Chris Spear highlighted some of the organization’s wins as the trucking industry ushers in a more trucking-friendly political and regulatory era.

“We are in a market situation where demand remains low, and capacity is far too high,” said Spear to fleet executives, state associations, and industry suppliers at the 2025 ATA Management Conference & Exhibition in San Diego. “We know what a challenge that is and continues to be for each of you. It underscores why your advocacy of the ATA policy agenda is more important now than ever before.”

Spear touted several legislative and regulatory wins in the first nine months of the 119th U.S. Congress and the second Trump administration. “President Trump and the Republican-led Congress have wasted zero time moving several ATA priority issues,” said Spear, including the elimination of California’s Advanced Clean Truck, Advanced Clean Fleet, and Low NOx regulations; the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Greenhouse Gas III requirements; English Language Proficiency enforcement; entry-level driver training; cabotage; cargo theft; and the use of recreational marijuana. “We upended the Biden-Su assault on independent contractors and expanded workforce development opportunities, dropped federal legislation on lawsuit abuse… and ATA helped add yet another $200 million for truck parking. Huge wins, with much more to come.”

Spear said ATA’s most important initiative remaining in its crosshairs is EPA’s low-NOx rule. “This rule is effective, but it’s also untested and littered with several added costs per power unit that have little to no impact on the environment,” he said. “Our conversations with the EPA are ongoing, and we’re pushing for an immediate answer on their reopening, delaying, and changing the rule. We’ll keep you posted.

The need for tort reform and the impact of nuclear verdicts were hot topics at this year’s MC&E, and Spear said ATA’s state-level support in recent years has helped nearly 20 states pass legislation to reduce the financial impact on the trucking industry.

“This White House and Congress may well be in a position to help us push through some federal reforms, including a bill we had introduced last month that would move these frivolous state suits to a level playing field in federal court,” said Spear. “So for the first time, ATA is putting a secondary lawsuit abuse strategy to advance federal legislation into full motion, further kicking the plaintiffs’ bar to the curb.”

On the labor front, Spear highlighted the need to erase Biden-era independent contractor regulations and focus on attracting and retaining qualified and skilled drivers.

“We outright oppose any federal rule that intentionally wipes out individual choice, crushes opportunities, and sidelines hundreds of thousands of truckers who move our economy,” said Spear. “Having a rule we understand and can comply with will protect the more than 350,000 independent contractors who have a critical role in our industry.”

The driver shortage didn’t rank in the American Transportation Research Institute’s Top Industry Issues report for the first time in the survey’s 21-year history, but Spear said a relative shortage of talent remains, highlighted by recently publicized crashes of unqualified drivers in Florida and California.

“It’s about qualifications,” said Spear. “We don’t lack people with CDLs… what we lack is the number of qualified drivers who meet our high standards of professionalism and safety. Qualified means you can speak English, read road signs, understand safety rules, and respect our laws. Qualified means you are not abusing alcohol or using drugs. Qualified means you earned your CDL the right way, not through a rubber-stamped process in a state that looks the other way.

The actual amount is much less,"Ishan Thakore, John Daley, Allison Sherry, Jenny Brundin, The Associated Press",,,,,https://www.cpr.org/2025/10/27/doe-funding-cuts-overstated-data-shows/,"On Oct 1, the first day of the government shutdown, the U.S. Department of Energy said it was canceling more than $7.5 billion in energy projects to save taxpayers' money.
But a review of cut projects reveals that the Trump administration actually eliminated more than $1 billion for fossil fuel research.
Gillingham, the Yale professor, said it was not unusual for some DOE projects to stall, or even fail, because other projects may lead to breakthroughs.
While the Trump administration has expressed outright hostility towards solar power, officials have been bullish about advanced nuclear energy.
Danis said the Trump administration is proving itself an unreliable investment partner by canceling grants on such short notice.","On Oct 1, the first day of the government shutdown, the U.S. Department of Energy said it was canceling more than $7.5 billion in energy projects to save taxpayers' money.

In termination letters, the agency told several grantees that the projects no longer align with the Trump administration’s pro-energy, especially pro-fossil fuel, approach.

But a review of cut projects reveals that the Trump administration actually eliminated more than $1 billion for fossil fuel research.

The DOE also overstated how much it saved taxpayers, according to an agency list of terminated projects that CPR News matched with publicly available spending estimates.

The data indicate that the DOE actually terminated far less funding — $5.8 billion worth of federal awards, which ranged from money for transmission lines to research on capturing carbon from the atmosphere.

Around $403 million of that money has already been distributed to recipients, further limiting what the government is able to recoup.

In a press release, the department said the 223 projects it terminated “would not provide a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars,” and did not “expand America’s supply of affordable, reliable and secure energy.”

But some recipients said their work supports the Trump administration’s agenda, raising questions about how exactly the DOE picked projects to cut.

Dan Zimmerle’s center at Colorado State University works directly with oil and gas companies to help them reduce methane emissions, a potent greenhouse gas. That has both an environmental benefit but also helps companies detect leaks, sell more natural gas and improve their bottom line.

He said in 14 years of working with the DOE, he’s never had a grant canceled. “Most of the projects we had canceled are quite well-aligned with the administration’s stated objectives,” he said.

The DOE did not respond to multiple requests for comment about the criteria it used to terminate projects or the discrepancy of the total cuts.

Yale School of the Environment professor Kenneth Gillingham said eliminating such funding is “incredibly disruptive,” and would set the U.S. behind. The government has historically played a major role in funding scientific research, which has led to medical breakthroughs and even the internet.

“Having funding pulled is a death knell to many projects that have real jobs and real people’s lives attached to them,” he said.

“Pulling back on that innovation is just simply short-sighted.”

Some projects received bipartisan funding

In a press release and a TV interview, Energy Secretary Chris Wright said that each project underwent a “thorough, individualized financial review,” and denied the cuts targeted Democratic states.

“Our decisions have been made over the last few months,” he said during a CNN interview. He said a team of advisors evaluated over 2,400 projects on “whether it makes sense for the American taxpayers or not.”

White House budget director Russell Vought was more blunt — he said in a post on X that the projects were part of “Green New Scam” climate initiatives undertaken by Democrats.

But at least 56 terminated grants had already received congressional funding through the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, according to grant descriptions. Others received congressional investments from the Inflation Reduction Act, a landmark Biden-era climate law.

Some projects had even been greenlit to continue work by the Trump administration as recently as May, according to publicly available grant updates.

The terminations have caused uncertainty, looming layoffs and confusion in Colorado, where the DOE has marked 34 grants for termination.

In a letter, Colorado’s Democratic congressional delegation has demanded answers from the DOE about why projects were terminated. They have not received an explanation, according to a spokesperson for Sen. Michael Bennet.

A larger group of Democratic and independent U.S. senators also criticized the cuts and said the DOE likely broke the law by terminating contracts that Congress authorized.

“The illegality of your cancellations is the only thing as indisputable as the harm your cancellations will wreak,” they wrote in a letter to Wright and Vought.

Oil and gas projects get the axe

From a metal, springy catwalk, Zimmerle surveyed five large tanks that typically hold fluids collected from oil and gas drilling. The tanks are empty, though, and the wells around them are fake.

“It’s a Hollywood set,” he said, gesturing to an array of equipment that is not being actively used for drilling.

Zimmerle runs the Methane Emissions Technology Evaluation Center (METEC) at Colorado State University. It’s both a research group and the only test facility of its kind in the United States.

The facility allows researchers and oil and gas operators to study advanced ways to detect methane leaks and simulate tests around real equipment.

Part of the center’s funding comes from DOE contracts. The funds support its operations and emissions research. The money also supports oil and gas companies to get technical assistance from the facility.

“We probably work with 40 to 60 operators on any given year, and they’re getting value from that,” Zimmerle said.

In January, the DOE awarded Zimmerle’s group some of the largest grants CSU has ever received. One project, for $299 million, was for equipment and technical and job training for small oil and gas operators, many in Republican-led states.

But in October, the DOE said it canceled several of the center’s grants.

Zimmerle said a termination letter he received indicated his active projects did “not align with agency priorities.”

The Trump administration, though, has been an avid supporter of the oil and gas industry, which has also actively supported Zimmerle’s work.

The Environmental Partnership, a trade group representing U.S. onshore oil and gas companies and run by the American Petroleum Institute, said in a statement that the facility has “played a vital role” in helping companies cut their emissions.

The DOE did not return a request for comment about Zimmerle’s projects.

Greener energy targeted

Around 80 miles south, on a grassy plain a few miles from the Denver airport, Hank Price is doing very different research. He stood in the shadow of a nearly three-story collection of curved mirrors, part of a large, curved solar device dubbed the Sun Beam.

It’s used as part of a technology called Concentrating Solar Power.

Unlike traditional solar panels, the technology uses mirrors to create heat. It then repurposes that heat to create electricity. Solar power plants built using the technology solve a perennial problem: they can generate power even after the sun sets.

Price’s company, Solar Dynamics, has been testing and improving the technology over the last decade, partly supported by contracts with the federal government, he said.

One project sought to improve how solar power plants collect heat in storage tanks. Those tanks can store heat using “molten salt” at over 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit. But in the past, they’ve developed leaks and failed, sometimes spectacularly, posing a major challenge for the solar industry.

A major plant backed by a DOE loan suffered tank issues and went bankrupt, costing American taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars.

Gillingham, the Yale professor, said it was not unusual for some DOE projects to stall, or even fail, because other projects may lead to breakthroughs.

“When the government is investing in grants that are competitively awarded, they recognize that some of those grants are not gonna work,” he said.

One of Price’s projects aimed to test how those storage tanks are designed, to understand why they failed and how to fix them. The work is also relevant to “advanced nuclear energy” sites that use molten salt.

While the Trump administration has expressed outright hostility towards solar power, officials have been bullish about advanced nuclear energy. Secretary Wright’s first secretarial order called for the DOE to prioritize research on advanced nuclear power.

But Price’s grant was canceled for not aligning with the DOE’s priorities, according to his termination letter.

It took Price years to apply for and receive the federal awards, and he just lost his two largest contracts. His company will likely shut down in a few months.

“We’ve had a heck of a ride,” said Patrick Marcotte, Price’s cofounder, who had helped engineer and then build the Sun Beam by hand. “We’ve had a lot of fun doing this stuff, and haven’t given up hope entirely yet.”

More cuts, and likely lawsuits, coming

Since its initial announcement, the DOE has canceled funding for $700 million in battery and manufacturing projects across the country. Another DOE list claims to show more than $20 billion in cuts, according to E&E News.

Recipients can appeal their grant cancellations, and also sue the government. Jennifer Danis, the federal energy policy director at the Institute for Policy Integrity, a think tank, said these types of lawsuits are “relatively uncharted territory.”

“Across the country, courts are actively grappling with the rapid-fire grant terminations coming from this administration, for non-alignment with new agency priorities and goals,” she said.

In some cases, states are pushing back. Last week, a federal judge issued a ruling preventing the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration from terminating several awards issued to Washington state.

“By allowing a change in an administration to upend multi-year grants would cause unnecessary chaos across the vast world of government-supported endeavors undertaken by states, universities, non-profits, and others,” Judge Marsha J. Pechman wrote in her ruling.

Danis said the Trump administration is proving itself an unreliable investment partner by canceling grants on such short notice.

The cancellation of funding for Zimmerle’s CSU lab has left his team urgently seeking new funding. Without it, he’ll have to lay off staff and maybe shut down his facility.

“The damage is done now,” he said. “Success in a court case six months or nine months from now isn’t going to impact what we have to do right now.”",https://wp-cpr.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/20251016-federal-grants-solar-hank-price-hwv-019.jpg,N,,2025-10-27 19:59:17.703109

Our world is at a crossroads today. The biodiversity crisis is accelerating, with forests, rivers, and ecosystems that sustain people and wildlife under the growing strain of climate shocks. Worryingly, the global commitment to conservation funding is wavering even as the stakes rise.

For example, Germany, long a leader in financing Indigenous tenure rights, is openly debating cuts, while development and climate finance face serious headwinds in the United States. Around the world, conservation is at risk of slipping down the agenda. But here’s the problem: the demand for action has never been louder.

We know this because Environmental Defense Fund, along with its partners in the Coalition for Nature & People undertook research across Brazil, Zambia, and Indonesia to better understand how conservation projects funded by Official Development Assistance (ODA) are perceived and experienced by communities.

Interviews with Indigenous leaders and experts, and nationally representative polling confirm that we are in a delicate moment: there is strong public demand for conservation, but it is underpinned by skepticism about whether it will be delivered in ways that last.

84% of respondents said protecting nature is a top national priority.

86% expressed support for internationally funded conservation projects in their country.

73% agreed that Indigenous Peoples and local communities should hold leadership roles in those projects.

Expert interviews confirmed that conservation outcomes are consistently stronger when communities themselves are decision-makers.

These findings capture the paradox of this moment. Public will is clear. Community leadership works. Yet international support is uncertain, and the funding situation remains fragile.

And that’s why the role of international non-governmental organizations (INGOs) like EDF is so pivotal now: not to replace community leadership, but to build bridges, convene partners, and amplify voices in a moment when conservation needs both urgency and legitimacy. That responsibility endures even as politics and funding realities shift. That means those that adapt and listen will remain relevant while those that don’t will quickly lose ground.

Recent global convenings, like the IUCN World Conservation Congress echoed this direction: progress depends not only on channeling more finance, but also how support is structured: flexible, rights-based, and aligned with locally-defined priorities. That means moving beyond grants alone to strengthen decision-making power, simplify burdensome reporting that can be culturally inappropriate, and reduce reliance on intermediaries so communities can steer their own outcomes. It also means addressing gaps in visibility and finance for African Indigenous Peoples and local communities (IPLCs), even as momentum grows in regions like the Amazon.

The good news is that we are making progress. Organizations like the Global Environment Facility (GEF) are pledging to direct 20% of resources to Indigenous Peoples and local communities; and the Legacy Landscapes Fund opened a funding window for Indigenous Peoples. Mechanisms such as the Tropical Forever Finance Facility (TFFF) point toward models where IPLCs are true co-owners with flexible funding and streamlined accountability, pairing resources with secure rights and real authority.

Why does that matter? Because nature is our life-support system. It shelters wildlife, sustains livelihoods, and holds the key to climate resilience. Conservation succeeds when it is rooted not in top-down control, but in human rights and equity.

The good news is we have a clear arc to build on. Last year, the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) strengthened the formal voice of Indigenous Peoples. As we look toward Belém and COP30, four priorities are rising: 1) Increase the share of climate finance that reaches IPLCs directly; 2) Recognize Indigenous and local territories as vital carbon sinks in policy; 3) Embed traditional knowledge in adaptation metrics; 4) Ensure meaningful participation and decision-making.

These are the partnership standards EDF is working to advance.

The public mandate for conservation is strong and evidence of community-led effectiveness is overwhelming. What remains is to close the gap between demand and delivery and to ensure that the future of conservation is one that empowers people as much as it protects nature. INGOs have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to do so, as conveners and partners who help communities lead.",https://blogs.edf.org/climate411/wp-content/blogs.dir/7/files//b01c9f1e-754b-4bc6-8245-582f6f6f6181-e1761602813692.jpg,N,,2025-10-27 19:59:28.750161

Those rate hikes are expected to show up in the bills of over 124 million customers this year, PowerLines found.
""It feels like there's nothing we can do about it,"" said Karin Gudal, an AES Ohio customer quoted in PowerLines report.

In their campaign ads, both Democratic candidate Mikie Sherrill and Republican candidate Jack Ciattarelli promise they will help curb energy bills if elected.","Over the past year, Suzann Hernandez and Camilo Aguirre have put a lot of effort into lowering their energy bill. Beyond simple solutions like turning off lights or closing doors when either the heat or AC was on, the couple insulated their windows and kept the temperature set at a strict 76 degrees, even on the hottest days of summer.

Despite their best efforts, however, their energy savings strategy had little impact against a rate hike that went into effect in their home state of New Jersey on June 1. The increase, approved by the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities in February, raised the average electric bill for residents in the state by 17%, the utilities company informed customers in a letter sent out earlier this year.

""We thought it'd be, see at least like a $50 decrease,"" Hernandez told CBS News' correspondent Tom Hanson. ""When we compared it to what we got this year, we only saw a $20 decrease.""

It's not only residents in the Garden State who are feeling the pinch of higher prices.

""This is a national problem,"" Dan Cassino, a professor of government and politics at Fairleigh Dickinson University, told CBS News.

According to a new report from PowerLines, a nonprofit focused on lowering utility bills, utility rate increase requests and approvals totaled more than $34 billion in the first three quarters of 2025. That's almost double the $16 billion in requests and approvals over the same period in 2024.

Those rate hikes are expected to show up in the bills of over 124 million customers this year, PowerLines found. That will create economic hardship for customers For those Americans already struggling to make ends meet the hikes will mean additional economic hardship potentially affecting the wider economy, the organization said in its report.

By and large, customers nationwide are feeling powerless in the face of the escalating energy costs.

""It feels like there's nothing we can do about it,"" said Karin Gudal, an AES Ohio customer quoted in PowerLines report. ""We can try to make our buildings as energy efficient as we can...but even that takes money.""

Data shows that utility prices for American households have continued to climb. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, residential electricity prices this year were up 11% in August from January.

Politicians, meanwhile, are using their campaign platforms to cater to frustrated voters.

In New Jersey, for example, rising energy prices is an issue gubernatorial race candidates have latched onto in the lead up to elections on Nov. 4. In their campaign ads, both Democratic candidate Mikie Sherrill and Republican candidate Jack Ciattarelli promise they will help curb energy bills if elected.

Cassino expects the issue, which has consumed the political race in New Jersey, will soon reverberate in races throughout the country.

""This is a harbinger of what's gonna happen next year in the midterm elections,"" he said. ""This issue's not going to go away. It's not like the power bills are going to go down.""",https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/10/27/550107c1-9054-42d2-9db6-d452033251ba/thumbnail/1200x630/7995cd7796c8ec3ecbd272a1b68ae341/gettyimages-2240697242.jpg,N,,2025-10-27 19:03:51.445547

Because, as of now, many countries are using their power through international bodies to impose their harmful, anti-energy climate agenda on countries who don’t share their ideological objectives.

This problem has recently been highlighted by the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) proposed global carbon tax on the shipping industry. Until just a few days ago the IMO, a specialized agency of the United Nations, was set to impose its “Net-Zero Framework,” what is in effect a tax on carbon dioxide emissions from ships that exceed certain thresholds to be paid for by shipping companies. The IMO would have collected the revenue and then distributed it for such things as rewarding “low-emission ships” and for U.N. income redistribution schemes to “mitigate negative [climate] impacts on vulnerable States.”

This tax is especially egregious because it is a violation of the sovereignty of the U.S. and other nations. A U.N. international body would be imposing a tax on Americans, something that appears to be a first. The tax, according to the State Department, could increase global shipping costs by 10 percent or more.

It’s also yet another example of Europe and the U.N. trying to dictate the domestic climate policies of other countries. The State Department made it clear that it understood the fundamental problem this posed when it stated that the U.S. would penalize nations “that sponsor this European-led neocolonial export of global climate regulations.”

Fortunately, the Trump administration helped to delay a vote on the IMO tax plan for a year, but it is still looming. A tax delayed is not a tax canceled.

The IMO tax, though, is far from the only effort to impose climate policies on other countries. This past July, the U.N.’s top court, the International Court of Justice, issued a nonbinding advisory opinion that reads more like a climate manifesto than an example of logical legal reasoning. It concluded that member states have a duty to reduce and regulate greenhouse gas emissions.

It also stated the “failure of a State to take appropriate action to protect the climate system from GHG [Greenhouse Gas] emissions — including through fossil fuel production, fossil fuel consumption, the granting of fossil fuel exploration licenses or the provision of fossil fuel subsidies — may constitute an internationally wrongful act which is attributable to that State.”

While a nonbinding opinion, there is a very real possibility that this opinion will be used in various ways to justify greenhouse gas regulation in policy contexts across the world, as well as in litigation in other jurisdictions.

Then there’s the European Union’s carbon border adjustment mechanism, which is in effect a carbon tax imposed on goods based on their carbon intensity (i.e. how much carbon dioxide is emitted during production). The EU’s reason for the tax is clear: “to encourage cleaner industrial production in non-EU countries.”

Once again, here’s that “European-led neocolonial export of global climate regulations.” The EU isn’t imposing a tax based on the specific attributes of a good itself. Instead, it’s trying to use trade to influence and change the climate policies and production methods of other countries, in part to protect what remains of European industries as decarbonization bites.

It isn’t enough that EU nations have adopted harmful policies that punish energy use and increase prices for their own citizens. They need to make sure other countries hurt themselves too, including developing countries that need fossil fuels to advance the well-being of their citizens.",https://cei.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-1073161148-1200x628.jpg,N,,2025-10-28 06:58:23.799780

For now, demand for liquefied gas remains rather robust, even at current prices. The as Exporting Countries Forum reported this month that global exports of the superchilled fuel had hit an all-time high in September, at 34.59 million tons, representing a 3.7% annual increase thanks to a surge in buying from Europe, which is filling its storage caverns ahead of winter heating season. European LNG imports soared by 40% in September.

The U.S. Energy Information Administration earlier this month forecast that LNG capacity in North America alone could surge by more than 100% between now and 2029, to a total of 20 billion cubic feet daily, from 14 billion cubic feet daily at the moment. The continent is set to drive the global expansion in LNG capacity over the medium term.

Detroit breaks ground on first solar field under mayor's clean energy initiative

""There was nothing but illegal dumping and illegal activity going on here about a year ago, and now it's going to power the city,"" Duggan said.

The solar field will generate 10 megawatts of clean, renewable energy. Duggan said the goal is simple: to lower energy costs and make Detroit neighborhoods better.

""This is going to power huge numbers of city buildings and the money that we're making from the electricity, we're using to improve the houses of the neighbors across the street that will be here for the long term,"" Duggan said.

Haley Henley has lived in the Van Dyke-Lynch neighborhood for 50 years and said she's excited to see the transformation.

""It's kind of sad when you live in a neighborhood and you get afraid to come out in it after dark,"" Henley said. ""Thanks to the mayor for not forgetting about us.""

Neighbors like Dorothy Gladney are receiving numerous home improvements including roofing and insulation. Gladney received what she called a life-saving upgrade: a carbon monoxide detector.

""The best thing that this solar panel did was brought us together,"" Gladney said.

Four more neighborhoods are set to receive solar fields: Gratiot Findlay, State Fair, Greenfield Park and Houston Whittier. The total project will cover 167 acres.

The project is made possible by tax credits from the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.

""We said we're only going to the neighborhoods where we're wanted and as you can tell, we were very much wanted in this neighborhood,"" Duggan said.

The solar field is expected to be completed by mid-2026. DTE will hold additional informational sessions throughout construction.

The continuing federal shutdown means food benefits provided to 3.5 million Texans could be cut off in November, The Texas Tribune reported. Of those affected, nearly half are children.

“SNAP has funding available for benefits and operations through the month of October,” according to a letter written by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food and Nutrition Service to state agencies. “However, if the current lapse in appropriations continues, there will be insufficient funds to pay full November SNAP benefits for approximately 42 million individuals across the nation.”

More than $614 million is distributed monthly in Texas to recipients.

Currently, other assistance programs such as Medicaid and the Children Health Insurance Program, or CHIP, are not affected by the shutdown, which is in its fourth week.

Oil prices at lowest level since pandemic

Oil prices have dropped to their lowest level since early 2021, the Texas Standard reported. In an interview with Matt Smith, lead energy analyst at Kpler, he said strong supply is driving the drop per barrel to about $57.

Average gasoline prices in Texas stood at $2.79 a gallon in September, down 67 cents from two years ago, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Smith said U.S. oil production in July, the latest monthly statistic available, was at a record high. He predicted the low oil prices could slow domestic production by next year.

Fall enrollment sets record at Texas colleges and universities

More than 1.6 million students enrolled this fall at Texas colleges and universities — an all-time high, the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board reported. The preliminary numbers cover all levels of higher education, both public and private, and represent a 4.7% increase from last fall.

“The record enrollment numbers will help the state’s continuing efforts to build a talent-strong Texas and an increasingly educated workforce,” said Commissioner of Higher Education Wynn Rosser.

For the first time since the pandemic, enrollment numbers surpassed pre-pandemic numbers in each sector of higher education.

Judge tosses Texas book rating law

A Waco federal judge last week threw out a 2023 Texas law that required booksellers and publisher to rate their books based on sexual content and reference, kut.org reported. The ruling makes permanent a lower court’s temporary injunction that was later upheld by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.

The firm representing the coalition of bookstores and publishers hailed the ruling as a “major First Amendment victory.”

“The READER Act would have imposed impossible obligations on booksellers and limited access to literature, including classic works, for students across Texas,” attorney Laura Lee Prather said in a statement.

HB 900 sought to restrict which books are available in school libraries. It also required booksellers to rate their own books. The bill’s author, state Rep. Jared Patterson, R-Frisco, posted on X that he was “deeply disappointed” by the judge’s decision. However, he said SB 412 passed in the last legislative session holds school personnel “accountable” for exposing a child to what he termed “harmful materials.”

Proposition would fund dementia prevention research

As early voting continues through Oct. 31, the Texas Medical Association is backing Proposition 14, which would provide $3 billion in funding over a 10-year period for research into preventing dementia. The proposal, if approved, would create the Dementia Prevention Research Institute of Texas.

Houston neurologist Reeta Achari, MD, who testified in favor of DPRIT’s creation on behalf of TMA, said Proposition 14 has the potential to make Texas a leader in dementia research, and thus “attract much-needed physicians and subject matter experts and innovators from across the world.”

Alzheimer’s disease comprises 60-80% of dementia cases and is becoming a public health crisis, according to a report from the Texas Department of State Health Services. More than 450,000 Texans over the age of 65 are living with Alzheimer’s, the report states.

Opponents of the measure, according to a nonpartisan analysis by the Texas Legislative Council, fear it would create a new state bureaucracy without sufficient accountability and an open-ended financial risk for taxpayers.

Feds slash ACA enrollment program’s budget

With open enrollment set to begin for the Affordable Care Act, funding for a navigator program that helped 65,000 Texans enroll for health insurance has been slashed by 90%, The Tribune reported. As a result, nonprofits are seeking other ways to fund their efforts to help uninsured Texans find health care.

The state received $17 million in navigator grants last year. Most of the nearly 4 million Texans covered by an ACA plan find coverage on their own. However, navigators enrolled about 26,533 Texans and helped nearly 39,000 others obtain Medicaid.

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid said the return on navigator investment was too low.

“Despite receiving $98 million in the 2024 plan year, Navigators only enrolled 92,000 consumers—just 0.6 percent of plan selections,” according to a CMS statement in February.

About 17% of all Texans are uninsured, the highest rate of all states.

Nearly one fourth of traffic deaths in oil and gas regions

The Texas Department of Transportation is urging drivers to be extra cautious when driving in one of the state’s five main energy regions — the Permian Basin, Eagle Ford Shale, Barnett Shale, Anadarko Basin and the Haynesville/Bossier Shale. One in four of the state’s 1,023 traffic fatalities in 2024 occurred in those areas.

“Oil and gas production activity means large trucks and heavy machinery share the road with local traffic on rural roads and highways,” according to the news release. “Increased truck traffic can mean limited visibility for drivers and wear and tear on road surfaces, potentially creating hazards that are difficult to navigate and maneuver around.”

Nearly 79,000 traffic crashes occurred in those five regions. Failure to control speed and driver inattention were the top two factors contributing to those crashes.

States like California, which boasts the highest market share of EVs in the country, have numerous state-funded to programs, such as the Fast Charge California Project, to build out charging infrastructure.
To date, the NEVI program has helped build and open 93 high-speed charging stations, providing 410 ports, in more than a dozen states, according to the EV States Clearinghouse data dashboard.
When it comes to public charging, there are now more than 200,000 charging ports across the country, Rachel Reolfi, senior policy analyst for Atlas Public Policy, said.","In the next year, drivers on Arizona’s major interstates and state routes should have nearly three dozen new high-speed charging stations from which to choose to power up their electric vehicles (EV).

The state has announced the development of 34 high-speed EV charging stations, developed as part of a national initiative to increase charging options. Officials are seeking bids for private companies to build, upgrade, operate or maintain 34 stations. Of those, 31 are new locations. Proposals are due Jan. 16.

Funds provided by the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program (NEVI) will cover up to 80 percent of the construction costs of the stations, which will be privately operated, Garin Groff, a public information officer with the Arizona Department of Transportation, said. Construction on the initial round of stations, which are along interstates, is expected to begin by the end of 2025, Groff said, adding: “We expect it will take about one year to complete the stations.”

This round of charging infrastructure funding follows a previous series approved in 2024 for 18 stations along Arizona interstates. Arizona is eligible for up to $76.5 million from the NEVI program, a $5 billion component of the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. The state was also awarded $13 million for local and tribal governments in fiscal years 2022 and 2023 through the Charging and Fueling Infrastructure grant program.

The NEVI-funded chargers, which will supply at least 150 kilowatts of power per plug, will be placed about 50 miles apart, and generally within about a mile of a highway. Arizona was home to nearly 89,800 EVs in 2023, according to the U.S. Department of Energy’s most recently available data. And in 2023, 9 percent of all light-duty vehicle sales in Arizona were electric, according to Atlas Public Policy.

At least 439,000 fully electric cars have been sold in the United States this year, according to the Zero Emission Transportation Association. U.S. EV sales in the third quarter were up 30 percent year-over-year, according to Cox Automotive — owing, in part, to the phasing out of EV sales federal tax credits in September, which prompted stirring EV sales prior to the phase-out.

States like California, which boasts the highest market share of EVs in the country, have numerous state-funded to programs, such as the Fast Charge California Project, to build out charging infrastructure.

To date, the NEVI program has helped build and open 93 high-speed charging stations, providing 410 ports, in more than a dozen states, according to the EV States Clearinghouse data dashboard.

Not only is this infrastructure helping to advance the sale and use of EVs, but the development is having an economic development impact, industry observers and advocates said. When it comes to public charging, there are now more than 200,000 charging ports across the country, Rachel Reolfi, senior policy analyst for Atlas Public Policy, said. A research firm, Atlas focuses on clean transportation and clean energy.

“Only a very small portion of those were directly funded by these programs,” Reolfi said, referring to public-sector programs like NEVI. “But there’s all this additional investment that’s also happening.”

Each year, the NC Clean Energy Technology Center (NCCETC) celebrates National Drive Electric Month (NDEM) with events to showcase the opportunities alternative fuel vehicles provide. This year, NDEM took place September 12 through October 12, with 196 events organized across the country.

NCCETC hosted three alternative fuel vehicle showcases in North Carolina on September 11, October 4, and October 6.

The September 11 event was held at Wake Forest University’s Allegacy Federal Credit Union Stadium, ahead of the North Carolina State University vs. Wake Forest University football game. This electric vehicle (EV) display & tailgate event featured three red, white, and blue Ford F-150 Lightnings, two Mustang Mach-Es, a Mercedes EQB 300, and four Tesla Models including a CyberTruck.

Catawba College participated in the showcase and got into the tailgate spirit by grilling in the back of their EVs. The college also brought a solar powered battery pack to help power their operations. This event was an excellent way to show the unique ways EVs can apply in various situations.

The next alternative vehicle showcase NCCETC held was another football tailgate on October 4, at NC State’s Carter-Finley Stadium. This event took place right before the NC State vs. Campbell University football game.

The showcase was positioned along the route to the football game, leading to increased foot traffic and interest from passersby. Vehicles featured included a Mini Cooper S Electric, Chevrolet Blazer, Mustang Mach E GT, Volkswagen I.D. BUZZ, Ford F-150 Lighting, Organic Transit ELF, Rivian R1T Launch Edition, Hyundai Ioniq 9, BMW i3, Mercedes EQB 300, Genesis GV60, and several Tesla models.

The Organic Transit ELF is a solar-powered electric-assist tricycle that was a hit and drew attention from people of all ages.

The bright orange Tesla Roadster (the first Tesla model produced) also garnered lots of attention, with tailgate goers stopping by to take photos of the vehicle, sit behind the wheel, and admire its design.

The BMW i3 functioned as a cooler on this hot day, providing many with cold waters and sodas on their way to the game.

As part of NC State’s College of Engineering, NCCETC always looks forward to hosting this event to connect with fellow members of the Wolfpack.

The final showcase held by NCCETC took place October 6 at NC State’s Centennial Campus. This event saw a lot of turnout from first year engineering students, along with other students and professionals who were passing by and stopped to observe the display.

The static vehicles on display included a Chevrolet Blazer, Chevrolet Bolt, Mustang Mach E GT, Volkswagen ID 4, Ford F-150 Lighting, and several Tesla models.

This event was also a “Ride & Drive”, where individuals with valid driver’s licenses had the opportunity to test drive select EVs. The Ride & Drive vehicles included SPIN scooters and bicycles, Volkswagen I.D. BUZZ, F-150 Ford Lighting, Ford Mustang Mach E, Tesla Model Y, Model 3, and a CyberTruck. The CyberTruck had the most interest by far, with students lining up for the chance to ride in one.

This showcase was a great way to capture the attention of young adults who may be looking to purchase a vehicle in the coming years. By offering an opportunity for students to learn about these alternative fuel vehicles first-hand, many walked away with a new perspective on how these vehicles could fit into their everyday lives.

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission took another step to advance U.S. private industry production for nuclear fuel. The agency issued an Oct. 23 Federal Register notice seeking public comments on its draft environmental impact statement regarding a proposed TRISO–X LLC fuel fabrication facility on a 110-acre site at the Horizon Center in Oak Ridge in Tennessee.

TRISO–X, a wholly-owned subsidiary of X-energy Reactor Co. LLC, is seeking a special nuclear material license from the NRC to operate the nation’s first High-Assay, Low-Enriched Uranium (HALEU) fuel fabrication facility called TX-1.

On Sept. 30 the U.S. Department of Energy announced it had selected the following four companies for its nuclear Fuel Line Pilot Projects:

Oklo Inc. of California—to build and operate three fuel-fabrication facilities for advanced reactors

Terrestrial Energy Inc. LLC of North Carolina—to develop a fuel line assembly to demonstrate a fuel salt fabrication process.

Valar Atomics Inc. of California—to support TRISO fuel fabrication for the ultra-low power Ward250 reactor and possibly other high-temperature gas reactors. The Ward250 operates under 250 kilowatts with a 30 effective full power day range.

Tennessee-based TRISO-X—to build/operate an additional fuel fabrication facility to pilot processes for integrating, training and validating to support commercializing TX-1 fuel fabrication.

The NRC is in the process of granting TRISO-X a 40-year license to have and use special nuclear material at a fuel manufacturing facility. Public comments are due Nov. 17.

According to the NRC, the TX-1 plant would make “tri-structural isotropic–based coated particles and final fuel forms using uranium enriched to less than 20 weight percent uranium-235.” Both issuing the license to have and make this type of nuclear fuel would be the first time the U.S. government allowed this kind of domestic supply chain operation.

Texas Gulf Coast to Receive First Batch of HALEU Fuel

In August, TRISO-X and its parent announced the award of a $48.2 million construction contract for TX-1 to produce the first commercial batch of X-energy’s proprietary tristructural-isotropic fuel with the Dow Chemical Co. on the Texas Gulf Coast.

“X-energy is advancing its initial Xe-100 plant at Dow Inc.’s UCC Seadrift Operations manufacturing site on the Texas Gulf Coast. Once complete, the plant is expected to provide the site with safe, reliable, and clean power and industrial steam,” according to an Aug. 5 joint statement from TRISO-X/X-energy Reactor.

Once licensed to operate by the NRC, the TX-1 facility would be able to produce 5 metric tons of uranium to power up to 11 of the parent company’s Xe-100 reactors. Each Xe-100 is an 80 megawatt electrical reactor that can be combined into a four-pack with a total 320 MWe output.

Second Nuclear Fuel Plant Venture with Amazon

TX-1 is the first of two planned facilities at X-energy’s site in Oak Ridge that will manufacture HALEU fuel.

“X-energy is also advancing its second plant with Energy Northwest in collaboration with Amazon,” the joint statement noted. “This project is part of a larger strategy with Amazon to bring more than five gigawatts of new power projects online by 2039, furthering the company’s mission to provide scalable, secure, clean energy solutions that meet the growing demand for energy across the U.S. and around the world.”

Both the DOE and NRC are working together to streamline efficiencies that support commercialization of nuclear energy to bring more electricity to the grid. Reasons for the push are due to growing energy needs by AI and data centers as well as efforts by the Trump administration to decrease reliance on foreign countries in critical national sectors such as energy.

“President Trump has made clear that a strong nuclear sector is a central component of America’s energy security and prosperity,” Deputy Energy Secretary James P. Danly said in DOE’s announcement. “Restoring a secure domestic fuel supply will ensure that advanced reactors can move quickly from design to deployment and into operation. The ability to produce these fuels is essential to ensuring American leadership in nuclear energy and to meeting the nation’s growing demand for reliable power.”",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/685dea96df7d60ca8c93b97a/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-10-27 18:18:36.889801

The Dakota Resource Council filed the suit against the North Dakota Department of Environmental Quality and Riverview ND LLP in Traill and Burleigh counties.
“The permits for our North Dakota dairy farms were approved after careful, science-based reviews by North Dakota regulators, and our dairies are designed and operated to meet or exceed environmental standards,” the statement said.
Three North Dakota residents and a member of the Manitoba Eco-Network are disputing a decision by the North Dakota Department of Water Resources.
The Dakota Resource Council filed a lawsuit earlier this year seeking to have the Abercrombie permit revoked.","A North Dakota environmental group has filed a lawsuit over a giant dairy under construction in Traill County.

The Dakota Resource Council filed the suit against the North Dakota Department of Environmental Quality and Riverview ND LLP in Traill and Burleigh counties.

The Department of Environmental Quality in September approved a permit to Minnesota-based Riverview for a 25,000-cow milking operation southeast of Hillsboro. Crews began moving dirt at the site for what Riverview calls the Herberg Dairy near the Red River earlier this month.

“Dairies the size of Riverview’s Herberg Dairy create enormous amounts of wastes that contain pollutants such as nitrogen, phosphorus, bacteria, pathogens, sediments, pesticides, pharmaceuticals, salts, and metals,” the lawsuit says. “When discharged to waters, these pollutants pose serious threats to the health and wellbeing of nearby communities and ecosystems.”

International commission to review North Dakota dairy projects

The Herberg Dairy and another 12,500-cow Riverview dairy under construction north of Wahpeton, known as the Abercrombie Dairy, could quadruple the number of dairy cows in the state. North Dakota’s dairy industry has been dwindling for decades.

The Dakota Resource Council on Oct. 9 also filed a petition asking the Department of Environmental Quality to reconsider its decision to issue the permit for the Herberg Dairy. The petition cited the agency’s failure to consider Riverview’s plans to install a stormwater drain and a drainage system, according to the court document.

Riverview, which operates several large dairies in western Minnesota, issued a statement last week on the permit reconsideration.

“The permits for our North Dakota dairy farms were approved after careful, science-based reviews by North Dakota regulators, and our dairies are designed and operated to meet or exceed environmental standards,” the statement said. “We’ll continue to listen, learn, and work closely with the community to ensure our dairy farms support local families, create jobs, and contribute positively to the region.”

Drainage from the dairies also is the topic of another challenge to the projects.

Three North Dakota residents and a member of the Manitoba Eco-Network are disputing a decision by the North Dakota Department of Water Resources. The agency ruled that drainage ditches at the Riverview sites in Richland and Traill counties do not qualify as drains that would need a state permit.

The citizens contend the drainage ditches authorized by the state have the potential to pollute the Red River.

A preconference hearing before an administrative law judge has been scheduled for Friday in that case.

Manitoba environmentalists and the provincial government have taken an interest in the dairies because the Red River flows north into Lake Winnipeg, a major recreational and commercial fishing resource.

Manitoba announced earlier this month that the International Joint Commission has directed its International Red River Watershed Board to review permits related to the dairy operations.

The Dakota Resource Council filed a lawsuit earlier this year seeking to have the Abercrombie permit revoked. A judge ruled that attorneys for the Dakota Resource Council did not properly serve the Department of Environmental Quality and dismissed the suit.

The Dakota Resource Council has a different attorney in the suit filed Friday. The lawsuit lists attorneys from Washington, D.C.-based Food and Water Watch and the Wild and Scenic Law Center in Oregon. It also lists Bismarck attorney Sarah Vogel, a former North Dakota agriculture commissioner.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-47646/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/riverview_cows_feed-1024x6521761605367.jpg?h=881fb769&itok=BsED4Q6J,N,,2025-10-28 06:58:28.249407

Now, she has shifted her energy to building out the long-term strategic plan for The Chip Bag Project.","Eradajere Oleita makes improving her community a priority.

She’s an advocate for environmental preservation through local organizations like Detroit’s Green Task Force, and as an EcoWorks school coordinator, where she taught students about climate change.

Oleita stumbled on a video of a woman in England who fused used chip bags into sleeping bags. With the help of YouTube tutorials, Oleita made a couple of sleeping bags and donated them to local residents as a project for her 25th birthday.

The impact would extend far beyond her community.

The bags were a hit and quickly garnered an international audience. Donations – and sleeping bag requests from as far away as Singapore — have arrived since the social initiative began in 2020. The Chip Bag Project has distributed than 100 sleeping bags, Oleita said.

The sleeping bags are created by ironing layers of chip bags together until they form a thick layer, or blanket. The mylar material used to package chips is extremely useful as a warming utility: it reflects the heat of the occupant, making the bags a kind of cocoon.

It takes nearly 200 chip bags to produce a sleeping bag. The mylar material is also waterproof, making the bags durable in harsh weather conditions. The lightweight nature of the bag makes it convenient for individuals who move around often.

Now, five years after prototyping her first bag and scaling production, Oleita is revving up to take The Chip Bag Project to the next level. With a $167,000 grant from the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy, The Chip Bag Project will place neighborhood collection kiosks throughout the state.

Oleita plans to install the first kiosk at the Detroit People’s Food Co-op this fall.

“Our members are passionate about recycling and composting, so we are excited for the project. It will definitely be an opportunity for people to learn more about the mission,” said Jason Ford, director of operations for the Detroit Black Community Food Sovereignty Network, the nonprofit that built the co-op.

The Chip Bag Project aims to install additional kiosks at locations around the state in time for Earth Day 2026. The kiosks will serve as both a collection site and educational touchpoint where residents can learn more about upcycling and the use of mylar.

‘I want to create something that’s sustainable’

For Oleita, the mission of The Chip Bag Project goes beyond sleeping bags. She wants the world to think about how it can produce less waste.

“I’m in the field of figuring out how we can minimize our waste, and how we can have socially conscious human practices,” she told Planet Detroit.

Oleita’s passion for environmental justice began when she was a child in Nigeria. That passion led her to be a Clean Air and Water Fellow in 2019, a Work For Me, DTE! Fellow, and a Detroit organizer for the Michigan Environmental Justice Coalition.

Oleita said she’s slowed down and shifted her priorities from production to building infrastructure, despite the demand for more sleeping bags.

“I don’t want to rush something that feels so ordained,” Oleita said.

When the goal was to make only a few sleeping bags, Oleita said she could get by with support from friendly volunteers. Oleita credits her team with giving her the support to move forward, and recalls the exhaustion she experienced from producing bags while trying to establish the organization.

“It felt as if I was trying to build the bike, ride the bike, and fix the bike, all at the same time.”

A lack of resources made it hard to expand Oleita’s vision past the initial goal, she said. Now, she has shifted her energy to building out the long-term strategic plan for The Chip Bag Project.

Oleita is focused on building a sustainable nonprofit organization that caters to the cause long after the trend has passed, she said.

The project has five team members and a co-director. A seven-person advisory board is being established.

Recognizing the importance of the project to the community, Oleita said she’s selecting team members who are dedicated to building a foundation with integrity.

“It’s not for me. It’s for the next executive director, who hopefully will come on in the next five years. I want to create something that’s sustainable.”

Her inventory of chip bag donations stands at 1 million pounds.

The Chip Bag Project spreads the word about upcycling

Aside from sleeping bags, The Chip Bag Project has distributed 5,000 warming kits to unhoused individuals, that include food donations this year.

Oleita plans to upgrade the sleeping bags. She is intent on delivering a bag that caters to the needs of unhoused people while protecting the environment. She’s working on the design and durability of the sleeping bags for the next release, scheduled for 2026.

“We see the sleeping bags, and they’re always so functional, but there are just little elements that are missing. They could be better.”

For a growing startup like The Chip Bag Project, a dedicated space is crucial. Oleita said she hopes to grow into a space that allows for production and education, where people can learn about upcycling and be part of the process.

In March, the organization held a bag production workshop with StockX as part of 313 Day. Oleita said she hopes to do more of these sessions when she has a physical location.

As The Chip Bag Project continues to grow, Oleita said she’s focused on one core mission: raising awareness about the benefits of upcycling.

“I want people to think more about upcycling,” she said. “Not just for fads, but to think about the second life of each product.”",https://planetdetroit.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ChipBagProject2-1.jpeg,N,,2025-10-27 18:04:35.828674

LPG is often overlooked in global energy debates, but its importance cannot be overstated.
The energy transition is not a race between good and evil technologies.","When people talk about the energy transition, the conversation is often dominated by wind, solar, and hydrogen. These technologies are vital for our long-term climate ambitions, but they are not the whole story. For billions of people and for the global energy system, the real bridge to a cleaner future is liquefied petroleum gas, or LPG.

BGN has built its legacy on partnership, adaptability and a commitment to sustainable progress. We hold a 10% share of the global LPG market. This isn’t just a statistic; it’s a testament to the role LPG plays in accelerating the global energy transition.

LPG is often overlooked in global energy debates, but its importance cannot be overstated. For much of the world, the choice isn’t between LPG and solar; it’s between LPG and far more harmful fuels such as coal, wood or kerosene. LPG burns cleaner than these alternatives, emitting up to 50% less carbon dioxide than coal and 20% less than heating oil. It also eliminates sulfur oxides and dramatically reduces particulate matter, improving air quality and public health.

More than two billion people still lack access to clean cooking fuels, relying on biomass and other polluting sources. These traditional fuels are linked to an estimated 3.7 million premature deaths every year, largely due to indoor air pollution. LPG offers a life-saving alternative, reducing emissions now and paving the way for future electrification. It’s not a luxury; it’s a necessity.

LPG’s versatility is another reason it’s so vital. It’s used for heating, industrial processes, agriculture, and even transportation. In regions where renewable infrastructure is limited and capital is constrained, LPG provides reliable, affordable energy that can be deployed quickly and at scale. It is a pragmatic solution for communities that cannot wait decades for solar panels or wind farms to arrive.

Critics sometimes argue that investing in LPG could delay the adoption of renewables. But this binary perspective ignores the reality on the ground. The energy transition is not a race between good and evil technologies. It is a complex, multi-stage process that must balance environmental goals with economic and social realities. LPG is not in competition with renewables; it complements them.

In fact, LPG plays a critical role in supporting renewable energy systems. It acts as a backup for intermittent power sources, enhancing energy security and grid stability. In countries with limited natural gas infrastructure, LPG generators provide reliable electricity, supporting economic development and decarbonization efforts. It is a flexible, scalable fuel that can be integrated into hybrid energy systems, making it a cornerstone of resilient energy planning.

This is where the United States comes in. As one of the world’s largest producers and exporters of LPG, the U.S. holds the key to unlocking its global potential. American infrastructure, innovation, and investment are essential to making LPG accessible and sustainable for millions of people worldwide. The U.S. has the opportunity to lead.

By expanding LPG exports, investing in cleaner production technologies, and supporting international partnerships, the U.S. can help accelerate the transition away from dirty fuels.

Moreover, the U.S. stands to benefit economically. The global demand for LPG is growing, particularly in emerging markets where energy access is still a challenge. By positioning itself as a reliable supplier of clean-burning fuels, the U.S. can strengthen its energy leadership while creating jobs and driving innovation at home.

We must also recognize the role of infrastructure. Investments in LPG terminals, storage facilities, and distribution networks are critical to ensuring that this fuel reaches those who need it most. These investments deliver real, immediate benefits: cleaner air, lower emissions, and greater energy security. They also lay the groundwork for future energy systems that are more sustainable and inclusive.

At BGN, we believe the path to sustainability requires a number of solutions. We are the largest offtaker of U.S. LPG, but are not limited to that fuel. We trade in a range of sustainability solutions, including LNG, ammonia and biofuels. We are also invested in critical minerals, which play a key role in the energy transition, and are used in wind, solar, hydrogen and nuclear energy.

The energy transition is not a straight line. It is a bridge, and LPG is one of its strongest pillars. It should get the attention it deserves.

I spent most of my summers in Wyoming riding north of the interstate here, moving cattle

That’s Prometheus founder Trenton Thornock. His family has ranched this land for six generations.

He left for a career in finance, but now he has a new way to make money here - building data centers in the wild west. And he’s also finding ways to power them.

so right here, we're measuring the amount of sunlight that we get during the day

He points to a weather station. It’s finding the best angle for solar panels……for potential big tech customers - like Google and Meta.

If if you look this way along the ridgeline, you’ll see another big row of wind turbines. We sit right in the middle of all of this renewable energy infrastructure.

“Sustainable infrastructure for the age of AI” is Prometheus' tagline. But sustainability isn’t simple at the company’s flagship center - it will produce all its own power, recycle its water, use efficient cooling systems and even use heat from whirring servers to grow microgreens and farm shrimp.

And Thornock says all that - still won’t be enough.

You’ve got gas pipelines on both sides for natural gas generation.

The bulk of its energy – at least for now – is slated to come from fossil fuels - natural gas, which is abundant in Wyoming.

In the long-run Thornock wants to transition to small modular reactors…mini nuclear plants - but the tech is still a ways off.

So why not turn to wind and solar to fill the gap? Prometheus says it’s expensive.

You know, a thousand megawatt wind farm does not provide the same capacity as a thousand megawatt coal plant or a natural gas plant,

Mary Throne is a lawyer for Prometheus, and former lawmaker. She questions the reliability of renewable energy for data centers - some need as much power as a small city.

We really need to be more forward thinking and more open to taking advantage of all sources of energy. Technology is our friend

Technology like carbon capture. That’s how Prometheus plans to achieve net zero. Since it plans to use natural gas, it’ll offset the impact by paying another company to transport liquid CO2 from ethanol plants in the Midwest to Wyoming…then inject it into the ground about 60 miles from the data center.

But Amory Lovins says this isn’t very high quality sustainability. The Stanford professor is the founder of the nonprofit Rocky Mountain Institute.

It sounds like a pretty sketchy model.

He sits in what looks like a jungle –a solar banana farm in his Aspen, Colorado, living room. Lovins says carbon capture data isn’t always trustworthy - though Prometheus says its credits will be third-party certified.

It's a lot more straightforward to make your own clean power on site.

But Thornock says Prometheus will still build the first net-zero data center.

He gets in his car. He says he sees himself as a steward of the sagebrush-covered land.

We've been here for generations.

The name Prometheus comes from Greek mythology and means foresight.

We hope to be here for many more generations and my nephews and nieces will someday inherit the ranch.",https://knpr.org/favicon-32x32.png,N,,2025-10-27 17:04:36.968504

Aclara Resources Inc., headquartered in Vancouver, British Columbia, announced a $277 million investment to construct the first US heavy rare earth separation facility at the Port of Vinton, according to a news release from Louisiana Economic Development.

The company plans to mine deposits of rare earth metals in South America and ship them to Louisiana for processing at its proposed facility in Vinton. The facility will use hydrochloric acid to extract and separate the metals from the clay mineral deposits.

Rare earth elements — such as dysprosium, neodymium, praseodymium and terbium — are considered critical materials for many industries. Some are used as high-powered magnets in wind turbine motors, vehicle alternators and heat-seeking missiles, according to ScienceNews. Others are used as high-temperature alloys in aircraft engines and nuclear reactors, or as signal amplifiers in fiber optic cables, among other applications.

Aclara’s Louisiana facility is expected to directly employ 140 people. It will occupy an LED Certified Site at the Port of Vinton, prequalified for industrial development through environmental and engineering reviews.

“Louisiana provides ready access to the key reagents we depend on, helping ensure operational reliability and lower transportation costs,” Aclara Resources CEO Ramón Barúa said in the news release. “The state’s world-class chemical industry and highly skilled workforce made the decision even more compelling. Simply put, Louisiana has everything we were looking for.”

The state is giving Aclara a $3 million grant to pay for infrastructure and an additional job-creation grant for as much as 22% of wages paid. Additionally, the company will be eligible for the state’s lucrative Industrial Tax Exemption Program through which it will be largely exempt from property taxes in Calcasieu Parish.

Construction is expected to begin in 2026 and be completed in 2027.

Aclara boasts what it calls a sustainable mining process that uses no explosives, milling or wastewater ponds. The company says it recirculates 95% of the water it uses for mining and plants trees after razing the land. It plans to begin its mining operations in Chile in 2027 and in Brazil in 2028, according to the company’s website.",https://asiatimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/download-copy.jpg,N,,2025-10-27 17:05:15.058955

The vehicle targets affordability and promises to deliver a ""living room on wheels"" experience.

Parent company Foxconn will reportedly help bring it to market by 2027.

Cars are becoming increasingly electrified and software-defined. This shift in the industry is making the car-making game increasingly attractive to companies that wouldn’t have considered making cars a decade ago. Back then, who would've been willing to bet Japanese electronics giant Sharp would announce a car project?

Hardly anybody, but that’s exactly what the company announced today. Next week, Sharp plans to unveil a concept for its first-ever car—a minimalist electric minivan with a price tag it says “families can comfortably afford.” Nikkei says the study previews a series model that will enter production in 2027.

This isn’t actually Sharp’s first vehicle concept. In 2024, it revealed its LDK+ study, which had more of a van form factor. But the company says this new design is completely different and lighter than last year’s study, although it keeps the same ethos of being a “living room on wheels.”

The concept isn’t a final representation of what the company plans to produce, but it is closer to production compared to the previous one.

The news that Sharp wants to build a car may not be so surprising if you know who owns the brand. Taiwan-based technology company Foxconn (best known as the manufacturer of the iPhone) paid $3.5 billion in 2016 to gain a controlling 66% stake in Sharp, which was and still is struggling financially. Pivoting to cars could be a way for the company to stay afloat.

And Foxconn has wanted in on the car business for a long time. Its attempts have included acquiring the former Lordstown Motors factory in Ohio (itself a former General Motors plant) as part of a plan to build EVs in the U.S., but that never came to fruition. And it's been rolling out its own EV concepts for years now. (Foxconn also announced a tie-up with Mitsubishi earlier this year, but it's unclear if the ventures are related.)

Maybe the deal with Sharp will actually happen this time. Foxconn will provide the underpinnings for the new Sharp car, which looks like a typical people carrier with sliding rear doors. We don’t know much else about it other than the fact that it will have a projector and roll-down screen to double as a mini mobile cinema. This is something that really appeals to Chinese buyers, hinting at which market this vehicle was being designed for.

The Sharp electric minivan could be related to the Model D EV revealed by Foxconn’s automotive division, Foxtron. The company describes the vehicle as a Lifestyle Multipurpose Utility Vehicle (LMUV), and its focus is to provide a premium and tech-packed interior experience with four individual screens.

Underpinning it is an 800-volt platform that promises 410 miles (660 km) of WLTP range from an LFP battery with at least 100 kilowatt-hours of capacity. Foxtron revealed the Model D as a near-production concept, but it may never see a production line, and it could become the Sharp minivan instead, losing its Pininfarina-designed exterior.",https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/1Z2oJq/s1/sharp-ldk.jpg,N,,2025-10-27 17:04:54.671533

HOUSTON, Oct. 27, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NOV Inc. (NYSE: NOV) today reported third quarter 2025 revenues of $2.18 billion, a decrease of one percent compared to the third quarter of 2024. Net income decreased 68 percent to $42 million, or $0.11 per share, and operating profit decreased 45 percent to $107 million, or 4.9 percent of sales. The Company recorded $65 million within Other Items during the third quarter of 2025 (see Corporate Information for additional details). Adjusted EBITDA decreased 10 percent year-over-year to $258 million, or 11.9 percent of sales. Sequentially, revenue declined less than one percent, net income declined 61 percent, and Adjusted EBITDA increased two percent.

“NOV's operational performance improved sequentially in the third quarter,” stated Clay Williams, Chairman and CEO. “Strong execution on our offshore production backlog, disciplined cost control efforts, and continued efficiency improvements helped NOV maintain steady revenue and margins sequentially despite lower activity in energy and industrial markets. These efforts, combined with improved working capital management, drove robust free cash flow of $245 million during the quarter.

“Demand for NOV’s production equipment remains strong as the offshore upcycle gains momentum and global natural gas development expands. Bookings more than doubled sequentially, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 141%.

“While near-term industry fundamentals remain challenged, and inflationary pressures are prompting reassessments of both energy and industrial projects, the breadth and resilience of NOV’s portfolio continue to underpin our performance. We are encouraged by the resurgence in offshore investment and the emergence of unconventional development in new regions as these trends will rely on NOV’s differentiated tools and technologies.

“Our longstanding commitment to technology leadership and our diverse portfolio provide strength through cycles and opportunities for growth. Along with ongoing actions to improve our cost structure and better leverage our global platform, NOV is positioned to increase profitability, generate strong cash flow, and unlock long-term shareholder value.”

As part of its long-term succession plan, the Company also announced that its board of directors (the “Board”) had increased its size by one and appointed Jose Bayardo, President and Chief Operating Officer, to the Board. Mr. Bayardo served as Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer since joining the Company in 2015, until his promotion to his current position earlier this year. Mr. Bayardo holds a Bachelor of Science in Chemical Engineering from the University of Texas at Austin, a Master of Engineering Management and Master of Business Administration from Northwestern University.

Energy Products and Services

Energy Products and Services generated revenues of $971 million in the third quarter of 2025, a decrease of three percent from the third quarter of 2024. Operating profit decreased $76 million from the prior year to $38 million, or 3.9 percent of sales, and included $41 million in Other Items. Adjusted EBITDA decreased $37 million from the prior year to $135 million, or 13.9 percent of sales. Revenue declined due to lower global drilling activity levels and delays in infrastructure projects affecting the timing of capital equipment orders. Profitability was negatively impacted by a less favorable sales mix, as well as tariffs and other inflationary pressures.

Energy Equipment

Energy Equipment generated revenues of $1,247 million in the third quarter of 2025, an increase of two percent from the third quarter of 2024. Operating profit increased $1 million from the prior year to $130 million, or 10.4 percent of sales, and included $21 million in Other Items. Adjusted EBITDA increased $21 million from the prior year to $180 million, or 14.4 percent of sales, representing thirteen consecutive quarters of year-over-year Adjusted EBITDA margin growth. Higher revenue from the segment’s growing backlog of offshore production-related equipment more than offset reduced demand for aftermarket spare parts and services. Improved profitability was the result of solid execution on the segment’s backlog, cost controls and increased operational efficiencies.

New orders booked during the quarter totaled $951 million, representing a book-to-bill of 141 percent when compared to $674 million of orders shipped from backlog. As of September 30, 2025, backlog for capital equipment orders for Energy Equipment totaled $4.56 billion, an increase of $77 million from the third quarter of 2024.

Q4 2025 Outlook

The Company is providing financial guidance for the fourth quarter of 2025, which constitutes “forward-looking statements” as described further below under “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”

For the fourth quarter of 2025 management expects year-over-year consolidated revenues to decline between five to seven percent with Adjusted EBITDA expected to be between $230 million and $260 million.

Corporate Information

NOV repurchased approximately 6.2 million shares of common stock for $80 million and paid $28 million in dividends during the third quarter, resulting in a total of $108 million in capital returned to shareholders.

During the third quarter of 2025, NOV recorded $65 million in Other Items, primarily related to the write-down of certain long-lived assets and inventory, and severance charges associated with facility consolidations and other restructuring activities (see Reconciliation of Net Income to Adjusted EBITDA).

As of September 30, 2025, the Company had total debt of $1.73 billion, with $1.50 billion available on its primary revolving credit facility, and $1.21 billion in cash and cash equivalents.

Significant Achievements

NOV secured a contract to supply a monoethylene glycol (MEG) reclamation system for operation in the Black Sea with a national oil and gas company. The system will be integrated into the production facilities of a newbuild FPSO under construction in Asia by a leading EPC contractor. This award follows a series of recent project wins supporting natural gas developments across the Middle East, Eastern Mediterranean, and Black Sea regions.

NOV’s success with offshore drilling automation continues to expand. A deepwater floater operating offshore Guyana with NOV’s latest NOVOS™ and Multi Machine Control (MMC) automation systems achieved more than 17% improvement in connection time compared to the rig’s prior campaign. Additionally, NOV secured contracts to upgrade three ultra-deepwater floaters with advanced rig automation and safety systems. The projects include NOVOS, MMC, Pipe Interlock Management systems, and Red Zone Manager™ (RZM) safety technology, and an active Crown Mounted Compensator system.

NOV’s ATOM™ RTX robotic technology was deployed on a land rig in the Permian Basin, marking the first installation of this system in the U.S. land market. Building on proven results from offshore operations as well as more than a year of operations onshore Canada, the system enhances safety by reducing manual work in the red zone while maintaining high levels of consistency and drilling performance. Results show improved connection and tripping efficiency, supporting faster and more predictable well delivery.

NOV secured several orders for flexible riser and flowline systems supporting deepwater production projects in the Black Sea, Guyana, and Brazil. The awards include a second contract for NOV’s Active Heated flexible riser system, which combines flexible pipe and heating technology to address flow assurance challenges in deepwater environments.

NOV secured a second order for its APL™ Submerged Swivel and Yoke (SSY) system to support a floating LNG (FLNG) project in the San Matías Gulf, Argentina. The project will allow LNG exports from a consortium of regional gas producers. An innovative offshore system, the APL SSY system enables safe mooring of an FLNG vessel and continuous gas transfer through a subsea pipeline while reducing topside infrastructure and project complexity.

NOV was selected to supply double-wall fiberglass-reinforced plastic fuel storage tanks for a major financial institution’s data center expansion in the Northeast United States. The project includes two 40,000-gallon tanks that will provide additional backup fuel capacity to support growing data storage and power resiliency requirements.

NOV supported drilling and completion of the first tight gas unconventional well drilled by an international operator in Bahrain with a suite of downhole drilling and completions technologies. Vector™ drilling motors with ERT™ power sections were used to drill multiple hole sections while a 7-inch by 9⅝-inch GSP liner hanger with a 7-inch PureFlow™ stage cementing tool was used to install and cement the intermediate liner string.

NOV secured an award to deploy its Max™ Platform technology stack in support of a next-generation remote operating center for a major U.S. operator. The implementation advances a “managed-by-exception” model designed to increase efficiency and performance across drilling operations. Powered by Max Platform Services and Max Drilling technology, the edge-to-cloud system leverages real-time data, smart alarms, and AI-driven insights to streamline oversight and focus expertise where it creates the most value.

NOV secured two major wireline intervention package orders in the Middle East. The awards include projects for an international service company operating offshore Qatar and a project supporting Abu Dhabi onshore development, and encompass crane winch trucks, masts, wireline pressure control equipment, and control modules, among other intervention equipment.

NOV achieved record drilling performance in Weld County, Colorado, where an integrated downhole assembly reached total depth in a single 19,000-ft run in the Wattenberg Field. The system combined a ReedHycalog™ TKC59 Tektonic™ drill bit, a DAYTONA 25 motor, and the new Agitator™ Rage tool, NOV’s most powerful friction reduction tool to date. Designed to harness higher downhole pressures, the Agitator Rage tool leverages high-specification rig capabilities to produce greater friction reduction energy for drilling longer, more consistent laterals in the most demanding environments.

NOV ReedHycalog’s 8½-inch RH63-A1 Pegasus™ drill bit delivered record performance for an operator drilling in Devonian-age formations in the Central Basin Platform of the Permian Basin. These deep, hard formations are known for challenging drilling conditions, where bit durability and efficiency are critical. The dual-diameter bit design eliminated multiple trips and achieved a 110% increase in rate of penetration and 31% longer intervals compared to prior wells drilled in the region. These gains reduced days on well and delivered the lowest well construction costs the operator has recorded in the area.

Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call

NOV will hold a conference call to discuss its third quarter 2025 results on October 28, 2025 at 10:00 AM Central Time (11:00 AM Eastern Time). The call will be broadcast simultaneously at www.nov.com/investors . A replay will be available on the website for 30 days.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

This press release contains certain non-GAAP financial measures that management believes are useful tools for internal use and the investment community in evaluating NOV’s overall financial performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are broadly used to value and compare companies in the oilfield services and equipment industry. Not all companies define these measures in the same way. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures are not a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP and should therefore be considered only as supplemental to such GAAP financial measures. Additionally, Free Cash Flow and Excess Free Cash Flow do not represent the Company’s residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures, as the calculation of these measures does not account for certain debt service requirements or other non-discretionary expenditures. Please see the attached schedules for reconciliations of the differences between the non-GAAP financial measures used in this press release and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.

This press release contains certain forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures, including Adjusted EBITDA. The Company has not provided a reconciliation of projected Adjusted EBITDA. Management cannot predict with a reasonable degree of accuracy certain of the necessary components of net income, such as other income (expense), which includes fluctuations in foreign currencies. As such, a reconciliation of projected net income to projected Adjusted EBITDA is not available without unreasonable effort. The actual amount of other income (expense), provision (benefit) for income taxes, equity income (loss) in unconsolidated affiliates, depreciation and amortization, and other amounts excluded from Adjusted EBITDA could have a significant impact on net income.

ROCKVILLE, Md., Oct. 27, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Capital Bancorp, Inc. (the ""Company"") (NASDAQ: CBNK), the holding company for Capital Bank, N.A. (the ""Bank""), today reported net income of $15.1 million, or $0.89 per diluted share, for 3Q 2025, compared to net income of $13.1 million, or $0.78 per diluted share, for 2Q 2025, and $8.7 million, or $0.62 per diluted share, for 3Q 2024. Core net income ( 4 ) for 3Q 2025 of $12.2 million, or $0.72 per diluted share, compared to $14.2 million, or $0.85 per diluted share in 2Q 2025, and $9.2 million, or $0.66 per diluted share, for 3Q 2024.

The Company also declared a cash dividend on its common stock of $0.12 per share. The dividend is payable on November 26, 2025 to shareholders of record on November 10, 2025.

“We continue to execute on our strategic plan and see progress in driving long term growth and profitability,” said Ed Barry, CEO of the Company and the Bank. “The diversity of our business continues to be a strength as outperformance in our government servicing business offset a decline in USDA gain-on-sales revenues.""

“With and without the one-time items this quarter, we continue to grow our tangible book value and report solid returns on equity and tangible book value,” said Steven J Schwartz, Chairman of the Company. “We believe our continued investment in technology and infrastructure, while negatively impacting our current core earnings, will help us provide long-term superior returns to our shareholders. I am also pleased that the uptick in our credit metrics is almost entirely due to loans acquired in the IFH transaction, not to loans originated by Capital Bank. That gives me reason for confidence that our credit discipline, combined with our superior net interest margin, continues to constitute a core competency.”

Third Quarter 2025 Results

Earnings Summary

Net income of $15.1 million, or $0.89 per diluted share, compared to net income of $13.1 million, or $0.78 per diluted share, for 2Q 2025, and $8.7 million or $0.62 per diluted share, for 3Q 2024. 3Q 2025 core net income ( 1 ) of $12.2 million, or $0.72 per diluted share, compared to 2Q 2025 of $14.2 million, or $0.85 per diluted share.

During the quarter there were two non-recurring events that impacted net income:

The Bank identified Fee Revenue that was also previously recognized as Interest Income in the first and second quarter. As a result, the Bank recorded a one-time reversal of $1.3 million of interest income (“Interest Income Adjustment”). There was no corresponding adjustment needed to Fee Revenue as the fee income was correctly recognized during those periods.

Also, during the quarter, the Bank issued a call of brokered time deposits acquired from the IFH transaction, resulting in the accelerated accretion of $4.6 million (“Call of Brokered Time Deposits”).

Net interest income of $52.0 million increased $4.4 million, or 9.2% (not annualized), compared to 2Q 2025, and increased $13.7 million, or 35.6%, year-over-year.

Interest income of $64.9 million increased $0.3 million, or 0.5% (not annualized), over 2Q 2025, and increased $12.3 million, or 23.3%, year-over-year. When excluding the $1.3 million Interest Income Adjustment, interest income increased $1.6 million from 2Q 2025, primarily driven by $1.3 million of growth from OpenSky ™ and $0.3 million from the investment portfolio, while the increase year-over-year was primarily driven by organic growth and the acquisition of IFH.

Interest income included $0.2 million from net purchase accounting accretion in 3Q 2025, compared to $0.4 million in 2Q 2025. There was no impact related to purchase accounting during 3Q 2024.

Interest expense of $12.9 million decreased $4.1 million, or 24.0% (not annualized) compared to 2Q 2025, and decreased $1.4 million, or 9.7%, year-over-year. When excluding the $4.6 million one-time impact from the Call of Brokered Time Deposits, interest expense increased $0.5 million, or 3.2%, compared to 2Q 2025, primarily driven by a shift in portfolio mix.

Interest expense included a $5.3 million benefit from net purchase accounting accretion in 3Q 2025, which included $4.6 million from the Call of Brokered Time Deposits, compared to a $0.9 million benefit in 2Q 2025. There was no impact related to purchase accounting during 3Q 2024.

The 3Q 2025 provision for credit losses was $4.7 million, an increase of $0.6 million from 2Q 2025. Excluding the impact of a loan sale during 2Q 2025 from the acquired IFH portfolio, the provision decreased $0.9 million quarter over quarter. Net charge-offs totaled $2.5 million, or 0.35% of portfolio loans (annualized), down from $5.1 million or 0.75% of portfolio loans (annualized), in 2Q 2025. Net charge-offs in the quarter include $0.3 million from the Commercial Bank and $2.1 million from OpenSky ™ loans.

At September 30, 2025, the ACL Coverage Ratio was 1.88%, up $5.6 million or 15 bps from June 30, 2025. The increase in the ACL Coverage Ratio over prior quarter was primarily driven by a 12 bps impact resulting from the reassignment of an IFH acquired loan from non-purchase credit deteriorated (""non-PCD"") loan to a purchase credit deteriorated (""PCD"") loan during the quarter as a measurement period adjustment to the Day-1 purchase accounting, increasing the allowance for credit losses (""ACL"") by $3.4 million.

Earnings Summary (Continued)

Fee Revenue of $11.1 million decreased $2.0 million, compared to 2Q 2025 and increased $4.4 million year-over-year primarily due to the contributions made by the businesses IFH brought to the merged entity. During 3Q 2025, core fee revenue ( 1 ) of $11.1 million decreased $2.0 million as a result of a $3.1 million decrease in government lending revenue (net gain on sale), $0.8 million lower SBIC investment income, and a $0.1 million decrease in other income, offset by a $1.0 million increase in loan servicing revenue, a $0.6 million increase in government loan servicing revenue (Windsor Advantage ™ ), a $0.2 million increase in credit card fees from OpenSky ™ , and $0.2 million increase in mortgage banking revenue. Core fee revenue mix was 18.9% of total revenue for 3Q 2025, compared to 21.6% during 2Q 2025, and 14.7% during 3Q 2024.

Noninterest expense of $38.4 million decreased $1.2 million compared to 2Q 2025 and increased $8.6 million compared to 3Q 2024. Core noninterest expense (1) of $37.7 million decreased $0.5 million compared to 2Q 2025 and increased $8.5 million compared to 3Q 2024. Core comparisons include:

The decrease of $0.5 million quarter-over-quarter was driven by decreases from personnel expenses and regulatory related expenses, offset by growth in advertising expense mainly from OpenSky ™ .

Year-over-year expense growth of $8.6 million was primarily due to the acquisition of IFH.

Income tax expense of $4.8 million, or 24.2% of pre-tax income for 3Q 2025, increased $0.8 million from $4.0 million, or 23.2% of pre-tax income for 2Q 2025. The Core effective income tax rate (1) for 3Q 2025 and 2Q 2025 would have been 23.8% and 23.2%, respectively.

Financial Metrics

Net Interest Margin – NIM of 6.36% for 3Q 2025, increased 32 bps compared to the prior quarter, and decreased 5 bps year-over-year. Commercial Bank NIM (1) , of 4.64% increased 28 bps compared to the prior quarter, and increased 82 bps year-over-year. Net purchase accounting accretion for 3Q 2025 was 67 bps for NIM and 70 bps for Commercial Bank NIM (1) .

3Q 2025 includes the previously mentioned $4.6 million (59 bps) Call of Brokered Time Deposits and $1.3 million (17 bps) Interest Income Adjustment. Excluding these items, 3Q 2025 NIM would have been 5.95% and Commercial Bank NIM would have been 4.21%.

The average yield on interest earning assets of 7.93% decreased 26 bps compared to the prior quarter, mainly due to a 16 bps impact from the Interest Income Adjustment. Excluding this item, the average yield in the quarter would have been 7.77% a decrease of 10 bps compared to 2Q 2025 as a result of the overall rate environment. The average yield decreased 86 bps year-over-year primarily due to the acquisition of commercial loans diluting the positive impact from OpenSky ™ as well as the Interest Income Adjustment.

The Commercial Bank Loan Yield (1) of 6.74% for 3Q 2025 decreased 40 bps compared to 2Q 2025, and decreased 41 bps year-over-year. Excluding the Interest Income Adjustment, average yield in the quarter would have been 6.94%, a decrease of 21 bps compared to 2Q 2025 and 22 bps year-over-year as a result of rate environment.

The total cost of deposits of 1.73% for 3Q 2025 decreased 63 bps compared to the prior quarter and decreased 91 bps year-over-year, both mainly due to the Call of Brokered Time Deposits. Excluding this item, total costs of deposits for the quarter would have been 2.36%, consistent with 2Q 2025, and a decrease of 29 bps year-over-year due to shifts in product mix from the acquisition of IFH.

The total cost of interest-bearing deposits decreased 88 bps quarter-over-quarter, due to the Call of Brokered Time Deposits. Total cost of interest-bearing deposits decreased 151 bps year-over-year, to 2.41% for 3Q 2025 primarily due to the Call of Brokered Time Deposits as well as shifts in product mix from the acquisition of IFH.

Net purchase accounting accretion of $5.5 million, or 67 bps of NIM and 70 bps of Commercial Bank NIM, during 3Q 2025, which includes $4.6 million, or 59 bps, from the Call of Brokered Time Deposits, increased $4.4 million from 2Q 2025. There was no impact from purchase accounting during 3Q 2024.

Fee Revenue Mix – The fee revenue mix was 18.9% of total revenue for 3Q 2025, compared to 21.6% during 2Q 2025, and 14.7% during 3Q 2024. The core fee revenue mix (1 ) was consistent with fee revenue mix for these periods.

_______________

1 As used in this press release, Commercial Bank NIM, Commercial Bank Loan Yield, Core fee revenue mix and Core efficiency ratio are non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial metrics exclude the impact of income from the call of brokered time deposits, merger-related expenses and other certain one-time non-recurring pre-tax adjustments and tax impacts of such adjustments. Reconciliations of these and other non–GAAP measures to their comparable GAAP measures are set forth in the Appendix at the end of this press release.

Credit Metrics and Asset Quality – The ACL Coverage Ratio equaled 1.88% at September 30, 2025, an increase of 15 bps from June 30, 2025, and an increase of 37 bps year-over-year driven by a 12 bps impact resulting from the inclusion of an IFH acquired loan discussed below.

Credit metrics in the quarter were impacted by two loan relationships, both of which were acquired as part of the IFH transaction:

One relationship across three loans accounted for an $8.8 million increase to nonperforming assets. One loan of $5.0 million was previously identified as a PCD loan, which had a specific ACL reserve of $3.8 million established from Day-1 purchase accounting of the IFH acquisition. The other two are USDA loans with an unguaranteed balance of $3.8 million secured by underlying assets, which have no ACL reserve recorded.

The other relationship accounted for a $7.1 million increase to nonperforming assets. As previously mentioned, the loan was reassigned to a PCD loan as a measurement period adjustment to the Day-1 purchase accounting from the IFH acquisition. The measurement period adjustment for this loan resulted in recording a specific ACL reserve of $3.4 million during the quarter, or a 12 bps impact to the ACL Coverage Ratio.

Nonperforming assets were $52.2 million or 1.54% of total assets at September 30, 2025, an increase of $16.1 million or 47 bps compared to June 30, 2025, due to the $15.9 million or 47 bps of loans described above. Nonperforming assets increased $36.8 million or 94 bps year-over-year, mainly due to the acquisition of IFH. At September 30, 2025, substandard loans totaled $56.8 million, or 2.0% of total portfolio loans, compared to $44.6 million, or 1.7% of total portfolio loans, at June 30, 2025 and $23.8 million, or 1.2% of total portfolio loans, at September 30, 2024. The $12.2 million increase in substandard loans during the quarter was primarily driven by the $15.9 million of loans described above. At September 30, 2025, special mention loans totaled $71.5 million, or 2.5% of total portfolio loans, compared to $54.2 million, or 2.0% of total portfolio loans, at June 30, 2025, and $20.3 million, or 1.0% of total portfolio loans, at September 30, 2024.

Efficiency Ratios – The efficiency ratio was 60.8% for 3Q 2025, compared to 65.1% for 2Q 2025 and 66.1% for 3Q 2024. The core efficiency ratio (1) was 64.4%, for 3Q 2025, which increased from 62.8% compared to the prior quarter, and 64.9% for 3Q 2024.

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures

The Company has presented the following non-GAAP (U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) financial measures because it believes that these measures provide useful and comparative information to assess trends in the Company’s results of operations and financial condition. Presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is consistent with how the Company evaluates its performance internally and these non-GAAP financial measures are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in the Company’s industry. Investors should recognize that the Company’s presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures might not be comparable to similarly-titled measures of other companies. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for GAAP basis measures and the Company strongly encourages a review of its condensed consolidated financial statements in their entirety.

EGLE has consistently supported clean power for Michigan school transportation as the technology became available.
The EPA’s Clean School Bus Program (CSBP) of grants and rebates provides $5 billion nationwide through fiscal year 2026.
EGLE Director Phil Roos recently joined officials welcoming 18 electric school buses and 20 chargers to Dearborn Public Schools.
“It’s a bold investment in reliability, cost savings, and the health of our students and drivers.” Cleaner school buses offer many benefits, according to the EPA.","On the roads and in school driveways all over Michigan, a quiet revolution is underway: the transformation of bus fleets from dirty diesels to clean energy.

In a state where nearly 17,000 school buses transport more than 800,000 students a year, six years of state and federal investments have so far supported the purchase of nearly 900 buses producing low or no emissions. Some are yet to enter service.

The latest awards, announced this fall, total $35.9 million from the Michigan Department of Education’s (MDE) $125 million Clean Bus Energy Grant (CBEG) program. They’ll help 23 schools and districts, listed below, add 87 electric buses and 10 propane buses, along with supporting infrastructure.

And they’ll help Michigan breathe easier.

“Children and others in their communities benefit from cleaner air,” said Interim State Superintendent Dr. Sue C. Carnell. “We are happy to work with our partners at the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy (EGLE) to make our state greener.”

Carnell said the CBEG program improves the health, safety, and wellness of all learners, a goal in Michigan’s Top 10 Strategic Education Plan.

EGLE has consistently supported clean power for Michigan school transportation as the technology became available. In 2019 and 2020, the department awarded about $13 million in grants through its now-closed Fuel Transformation Program toward the purchase of 317 electric, clean diesel, and propane school buses and support infrastructure for more than 25 Michigan districts.

In November 2022, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) weighed in with $54 million for 138 new electric school buses and infrastructure serving 25 Michigan school districts, from Southeast Michigan to the Upper Peninsula. The EPA’s Clean School Bus Program (CSBP) of grants and rebates provides $5 billion nationwide through fiscal year 2026. Additional rounds of CSBP grants provided $5.9 million announced in January 2024 for up to 66 buses at eight districts and $23.98 million announced in May 2024 for 100 buses at 27 districts.

Also in 2024, MDE announced its first and second rounds of CBEG funding: nearly $30 million in June to help 29 school districts buy 114 buses powered by electricity, propane, or natural gas; and $15.2 million in October to help 21 districts buy 40 electric buses and 17 propane buses. Including the newest grants, CBEG has awarded more than $81 million.

Grant funds generally cover a significant portion of the costs for vehicles and infrastructure, with the balance paid from local sources.

EGLE Director Phil Roos recently joined officials welcoming 18 electric school buses and 20 chargers to Dearborn Public Schools.

“This is not just an upgrade to a school fleet,” he said. “It’s a bold investment in reliability, cost savings, and the health of our students and drivers.”

Cleaner school buses offer many benefits, according to the EPA. With no or low emissions compared to diesel engines, they result in cleaner air on buses, in bus loading areas, and in the communities where they operate.

Diesel exhaust can lower air quality and impact the environment and human health, especially for children who have breathe faster than adults and whose lungs are not yet fully developed.

Districts also save money on maintenance and gasoline, freeing up resources that can go back into classrooms.

And electric buses are quiet. Educators say without the racket of diesel engines, kids show up to school less distracted and more focused on learning.

Reducing emissions of greenhouse gases is a key goal of Governor Gretchen Whitmer’s MI Healthy Climate Plan for a prosperous, healthy, clean energy future for all Michiganders.

Applications for a final CBEG round of up to approximately $44 million are due Dec. 18, 2025.

Here are the schools and districts awarded grant funding for the latest CBEG round. Some awards include funding for charging infrastructure and related costs:",https://www.michigan.gov/egle/-/media/Project/Websites/egle/Images/Staff/EXEC/Dearborn-EV-School-Bus-event.jpg?rev=aebb3397189945068bcecfe49e92b257,N,,2025-10-27 17:18:27.359698

The One Big Beautiful Bill passed earlier this year expanded the 45Q carbon capture tax credit instead of ending it.","Louisiana Governor Landry’s recent order to hit “pause” on new carbon dioxide injection-well applications is a victory for Louisiana taxpayers, landowners, and communities who’ve grown tired of footing the bill for risky carbon capture ventures. For too long, carbon capture and storage (CCS) has been touted as an innovative solution for reducing emissions. Yet despite generous federal tax credits and R&D grants, CCS remains heavily dependent on taxpayer subsidies, threatens private-property rights through eminent domain, and puts communities at risk of groundwater contamination.

After spending billions of taxpayer dollars, most CCS projects have been abandoned or underperformed—leaving taxpayers to foot the bill. A study examining eleven federally funded projects found that eight failed or were canceled, wasting hundreds of millions of dollars on projects that were never built. And even when projects were built, they missed their targets. According to the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, not a single commercial CCS project has reached its target CO2 capture rate.

And it’s more than money that’s at stake. Carbon pipelines and underground storage sites pose real dangers—ruptures, groundwater contamination, and the looming threat of eminent domain abuse. In Satartia, Mississippi, a CO2 pipeline rupture sent dozens to the hospital. In Illinois, leaks from a carbon sequestration site near the sole source of drinking water for nearly a million residents have raised alarms about groundwater contamination. Many CCS developers are claiming “common carrier” status—despite offering little public benefit—to justify seizing private land for pipelines and storage sites, often against landowners’ will.

Following fierce opposition from local residents and parishes, Governor Landry issued Executive Order JML 25-119, directing the state Department of Energy and Natural Resources to temporarily stop accepting new Class VI well applications—a category of injection wells used by CCS projects to store captured carbon—while the state develops stricter oversight, financial-assurance, and safety standards. The order does not halt reviews of existing applications; instead, it requires the agency to re-evaluate pending projects, coordinate with other state and federal agencies, and ensure greater transparency and public participation before any new Class VI permits are issued.

The EPA typically oversees these injection wells but can grant states the authority to administer the program as well—a process known as “primacy.” Louisiana received primacy from EPA in December 2023, giving the state authority to issue Class VI permits. The first permit authorized the injection of up to 2 million metric tons of CO2 per year for 20 years for a single project, and since then, 33 applications have been filed. The order and accompanying departmental guidance set clearer review timelines, prioritize only a handful of existing projects for continued assessment, and strengthen public-comment and landowner-rights provisions.

This is not the first step Louisiana policymakers have taken to protect Pelican State taxpayers and communities. The state legislature passed several laws in June to protect landowners from eminent domain abuse by CCS pipeline developers. One requires disputes to be settled in the parish where they arise. Another requires companies to prove that a CO₂-storage or pipeline project provides a public benefit before land can be taken. A third requires consent from 85% of landowners before a carbon-injection well can be located in an area.

Louisiana is on the right track: real emissions reduction should not come at the expense of property rights, public safety, or fiscal responsibility. Unfortunately, federal lawmakers have gone the opposite direction and doubled down on CCS subsidies. The One Big Beautiful Bill passed earlier this year expanded the 45Q carbon capture tax credit instead of ending it. Originally projected to cost taxpayers more than $30 billion over the next decade, the latest expansion adds another $14 billion. The bill also increases the 45Q credit to $180 per ton for captured carbon used in enhanced oil recovery (EOR) projects—a technique the oil industry has relied on since the 1970s to extract more oil from aging wells. Now, companies conducting EOR as part of their normal operations will be rewarded even more generously by the supercharged 45Q credit.

By declaring this pause, Louisiana is protecting its communities with stronger rules, deeper scrutiny, and a fairer process that prioritizes residents over corporate CCS interests. It’s time for other states—and Congress—to follow suit. Instead of doubling down on costly, unproven CCS subsidies, policymakers should invest in emissions-reduction initiatives that truly benefit taxpayers and communities, or at least require stronger safeguards, transparency, and accountability for every taxpayer dollar spent.",https://www.taxpayer.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/CCS-Implied-1024x574.jpeg,N,,2025-10-27 17:05:21.421553

Two streets in rural Alabama are facing 54 cancer cases and 14 cases of kidney failure. A military family has been devastated by illnesses. A farmer lost a century-old family dairy farm due to contaminated milk. PFAS “forever chemicals” are poisoning drinking water and communities across the country.

In their new book Poisoning the Well: How Forever Chemicals Contaminated America, reporters Rachel Frazin and Sharon Udasin show how PFAS contamination became a national public health crisis — and they center the folks on the front lines of this crisis who are fighting for protections.

PFAS (“Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances”) refers to a class of more than 15,000 lab-made chemicals with stain-, stick-, and water-resistant properties. They don’t break down in nature, and they’re everywhere, from clothes to cookware to cosmetics. Every day, it seems, a new study emerges underscoring these chemicals’ pervasiveness and their links to a litany of health harms.

While many of the worst harms appear with major contamination, PFAS are in all of us. The CDC estimates that 97% of people living in the United States have PFAS in their blood, where it can persist for years.

“This is a massive, massive problem that is only going to grow over the years as we learn more in scope, in scale, about health problems, about where the contamination is, about how long it lasts,” said Rachel.

In October, we sat down with Rachel and Sharon to discuss the human toll of this crisis and the heroes who have worked to turn the tide. Despite the widespread harm, there is hope and work we can do — nationwide, everyday people are joining together to defend their communities and win protections.

The Everyday Heroes Fighting for PFAS Protections

Across the country, corporations making PFAS and using them in their products have dumped these forever chemicals into our environment and drinking water sources. As Rachel and Sharon explained, this has endangered the lives and livelihoods of people who just happen to live nearby.

And while companies learned more about the harms of their own products, they kept mum on the science for decades, continuing to proliferate and profit from PFAS.

The authors shared the story of Maine dairy farmer Fred Stone, who received a state permit to spread sewage sludge on his fields back in the 1980s. This sludge is the semi-solid leftovers from waste treatment plants. The state of Maine encouraged farmers to use it as fertilizer for decades. But in recent years, testing showed that it’s highly contaminated with PFAS.

“When [Fred] first found out that his area was contaminated, he got his cow’s milk tested,” Sharon told us. “He jeopardized his own business, this dairy business that’s been in his family for a hundred years. It has now crumbled to nothing. They’re in bankruptcy.”

But Fred’s personal sacrifice had an important impact. “He helped drive a lot of the forward-thinking legislation that the state of Maine has implemented,” Sharon said. Maine became the first state in the country to ban sludge-spreading and non-essential uses of PFAS.

Fred hadn’t ever been an activist. He said he just wanted people’s water to be clean — a basic right.

A similar story repeats throughout Sharon and Rachel’s reporting, from Colorado to North Carolina to Maine and Alabama. Everyday people discovered PFAS pollution in their drinking water and took action, fielding calls from their neighbors and educating their communities. And they’ve successfully pushed local, state, and national leaders to pass protections.

Fighting for National Protections Against PFAS Forever Chemicals

Folks like Fred Stone never should have had to be heroes. But thanks to the tireless pressure from frontline activists, we’ve now seen progress on PFAS after decades of nonexistent regulations.

In 2024, the Biden administration set drinking water limits for six common PFAS, requiring public water utilities to monitor these PFAS in their drinking water supplies and install technology to filter them if they reach a certain level.

It also finalized a polluter pays rule allowing the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to force corporations to pay for the cleanup of major PFOA and PFOS (two common types of PFAS) pollution.

Both rules were threatened by lawsuits, and it wasn’t clear if Trump’s EPA would defend them. Food & Water Watch immediately jumped into action, driving 20,000 comments to the agency. Then, in September, the EPA announced it would defend the polluter pays law in court.

However, the EPA also wants to axe four of the six PFAS from the drinking water rules and delay the requirements for the other two. That would add two more years during which people could be drinking contaminated water.

Sharon and Rachel’s reporting underscores the stakes of this fight — not just for these protections, but against PFAS overall. Preserving the polluter pays rule and drinking water limits are essential first steps. But we need to address this crisis at the root. To stem the flood of PFAS into our air, water, and lives, we need to end non-essential uses of all PFAS.

If there’s anything we can take from this event, it’s that everyday people do have the power to make a difference. When we come together, we can defend our food, water, and communities.

This could mean fast-tracking greenhouse gas emission reduction and further protection of the state’s coastal marshes.

“It’s not only a more efficient, effective use of funds [compared to a years-long survey and mapping endeavor],” Jacob Boyd, salt marsh program director for the North Carolina Coastal Federation, said. “But in those areas that are disappearing quickly, implementing [a solution] the sooner the better is always the best option.”

According to analyses from the UNCW Coastal and Estuarine Studies Lab, the salt marshes, particularly in the New Brunswick area, have significantly shrunk over the years due to sea-level rise. The shoreline has shrunk by at least 11 kilometers, and has lost thousands of acres of wetlands.

A $421-million pollution reduction grant from the EPA to the Atlantic Conservation Coalition — which includes North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, and Maryland — is funding a partnership between the North Carolina Coastal Federation and the nature-based and sustainability tech company, Natrx. The North Carolina Coastal Federation is a nonprofit organization dedicated to environmental education, advocacy, and restoration of the state’s coastal habitats.

Since 2021, Natrx has been working on an AI model that uses satellite imagery and a high-resolution geographic information system to create a map of the salt marshes along the coast. Having a higher resolution image allows for a more precise estimate of the erosion.

Natrx’s AI model takes satellite imagery from the last 15 years — publicly and privately uploaded — to assess how the wetlands have eroded and identify the patterns within that information. While Natrx does not take its own images, the AI tool is able to create projections of how the wetlands and marshes will continue to erode, based on how already happened in the past. That information will then be used to create customized solutions for specific sites. Bald Head Island, Oak Island, and Southport all contain salt marshes and will be under observation from Natrx’s AI model and the Coastal Federation.

The analysis provided by the program will include information on natural vegetation, the salt content or salinity of the marshes, the amount of carbon within those marshes, and how much erosion the areas have undergone due to ocean waves. The information is then compiled into a dataset for the North Carolina Coastal Federation, so the organization can locate high-salinity salt marshes, or a coastal wetland, and work to maintain those environments.

As sea levels continue to rise, and the rate of their rising accelerates — 4.5 millimeter per year, up from 1993’s 2.3 mm, and continuously growing — the need for protecting salt marshes grows in significance. Rising sea levels result in faster erosion, so there is a need to collect information on marshes at most risk annually.

Currently, the Coastal Federation has to make its own projections using historical satellite images and old maps, compiled by sending people to the individual sites to collect data. Boyd said it could take “several years,” though Natrx’s new model could speed up the process. It will provide new projections within 12 months.

“So this cuts it down pretty significantly,” Boyd said — “at least half or more.”

Natrx is able to capture more information from more sources over the last 15 years, and create a projection of the rate of erosion of the shoreline in a shorter timeframe.

According to Natrx’s COO, Tad Schwendler, the Raleigh-based company began the AI project in April 2025. He said this new way helps create “large swaths” of mapping into the future, whereas before people on the ground could only capture the present day.

But this isn’t just about protecting the shorelines. It’s also about keeping harmful carbon gas out of the atmosphere.

“Salt marshes are actually one of the highest carbon-sequestering habitats in the world,” Boyd said. “It holds a lot of carbon in the soil, so when the salt marsh erodes, the carbon is released from the soil and goes into the atmosphere as a greenhouse gas.”

Greenhouse gases trap heat in the Earth’s atmosphere, which further exacerbates global warming.

When the marshes get eroded, they release the carbon that is usually kept within the soil, so having a quicker process for mapping allows the federation to address climate change sooner.

The AI mapping will help inform solutions the Coastal Federation can propose to local governments and property owners as well. Schwendler said Natrx’s datasets allow them to provide solutions on how to be cost effective, give budgetary estimates for the shoreline solutions and even design recommendations.

Natrx has a technology called “ExoForms,” individual blocks that mimic the natural landscape, and are supposed to be a better alternative to seawalls and bulkheads, hard structures that disrupt the natural flow of water. The ExoForms start off as part of Natrx’s digital designs, but Natrx has technology to essentially 3D print the blocks.

The implementation of the ExoForms is not a requirement to use Natrx’s data; however, living shorelines can also be developed based on the AI mapping, which is Coastal Federation’s preferred method. Living shorelines — such as native plants, sand, soil, and other organic materials to act as a barrier and stabilize the marsh — absorb energy from the tides that normally lends to erosion.

The federation prefers the use of living shorelines as opposed to hard structures like bulkheads and sea walls. Boyd explained maintenance of living shorelines is normally cost efficient. A living shoreline can cost thousands less than bulkheads, for example.

The Coastal Federation expects to get Natrx results by April and from there will send surveyors to at-risk, or high-salinity and high-carbon value, sites and speak to property owners the salt marshes are on. The survey will allow the Coastal Federation to figure out erosion prevention remedies and costs.

Ultimately, though, the cost of the upkeep for these living shorelines would land on the property owners where the marshes are located, whether residential or government entities. The Coastal Federation has plans to educate both, presenting solutions as need be.

“The good thing is, too, these are going to be a couple-of-year projects, so we’ll have a lot of opportunity to do outreach in the areas where we’re doing the projects,” Boyd said, “and hopefully, there’ll be some education opportunities as well.”

RACHEL: All right. This is Rachel Nederveld. Lav and boom. For Sea Change,

CARLYLE: We are getting multiple mics going. Fancy, fancy.

RACHEL: I got two mics. The left one, I think the left is left channels, boom and right channel's, lav, I think.

CARLYLE: Rachel is a filmmaker and documentarian. She’d been living in LA for a while but moved back to her hometown of Lafayette Louisiana a few years ago.

RACHEL: I actually was working on a film that was about this elite athlete at the time when I moved back. Um, her name's Kit DesLauriers and she was the first woman to summit and then ski down the highest peak on every continent. And, uh, the film was about how she, after that, was kind of looking for what she was gonna do next and ended up in the arctic part of Alaska and found herself helping climate scientists with ground truthing their data because she had this crazy unique skillset of being able to be out in the wilderness and, uh, survive and, and a scent, the peaks there that other people couldn't do.

CARLYLE: so she was verifying the science in these very hard to access place. She helped measure how much glaciers had receded…alll kinds of stuff that helps us better understand climate change. Amazing story.

And it actually got Rachel thinking about citizen scientists, whether they think of themselves that way or not. People with unique skillsets who were not in Alaska but all around her.

RACHEL: And so, um, she ended up using this unique skill set of hers to help as a citizen scientist. And so kind of really got me thinking when I was here. How are all of the people here in South Louisiana, uh. How, how are people down here in South Louisiana using their own skillset in the same way of adapting and mitigating to our changing climate and and environment? how are people down here in South Louisiana using their own skillset in the same way of adapting and mitigating to our changing climate and environment?

CARLYLE: and so Rachel went out and discovered people who are finding ways to adapt to this very quickly changing place.

I’m Carlyle Calhoun and you’re listening to Sea Change. Coming up we meet a cross section of Louisianas from a poet to a minister to a computer programmer…each with their own story about how they are finding ways to adapt and to fight for the future of their communities.

MIDROLL

SUMMER: In Chauvin, there’s only one road in and the same road out. So we reference where we live as down the Bayou and up the bayou.

CARLYLE: That’s Summer Skarke. an elementary school principal and poet.

RACHEL: she talks a lot about kind of what's happening in Chauvin. She's really on the forefront of all of these different environmental, uh, um, changes that are kind of happening all at once.

CARLYLE: But you know, even though she's on the front lines of all of this, um, summer talks about how it's really just a difficult subject to, to discuss with people. And you talk to her about that.

RACHEL: How do you talk to students or kids about what's happening with the rising water and the erosion and the storms?

SUMMER: I feel that Chauvin people don't talk about it because it's a reality that you don't want, you live it, and so you don't wanna like, stay in it….(later tape) it's such a touchy subject and it's almost like something you don't wanna, how do you talk to someone about, that one day the place where you live might not exist, or it might be under water. It's a hard concept to imagine that the house that I live in may not be there one day 'cause it's just water. Even though I've seen things like that happen to some degree, I, I don't know that I even know how to touch that subject because I've seen that it could be a reality, you know? It's something I don't wanna talk about because it makes me mad.

RACHEL: Uh, summer's amazing. You know, it's really, it was really interesting to me talking to her about how her feelings are about this and, and just the fact that it's, um, it's so hard for people to understand what is coming, even if you know it. Like to actually be able to comprehend it in a more, in a more real way.

It's just such a big thing, you know? She says at one point, how do you, how do you understand that your home will one day be underwater? And she, and she did tell this, uh, interesting story too about this time.

She was at the symposium about wetlands and there was, um, she was there representing education with Louisiana in the bottom of the boot as she says. Uh, and you know that if you wanna play that story, I think that's another kind of amazing example of that.

CARLYLE: yeah let’s hear it.

SUMMER: and I was sitting with these engineers from Switzerland and all these places. And I remember them saying, you know, what are you gonna do when your school's not there anymore? Or your school's surrounded in water and like, are your kids gonna take a boat to get to school? And I remember them telling me all these things and I got mad and I was like, what are you talking about? Because in my head, as an adult, I could not wrap my mind around what they were telling me cause that was never going to happen. So why are we talking about things that's like ridiculous? That's how I felt.

RACHEL: Yeah, and you know, people at the symposium were talking about, you know, different places where you might have to put a school in a barge and maybe that that would be a viable solution down there for Chauvin and, you know, maybe 40, 50 years down the line. And that's, that's something that she could not imagine.

But then, you know, just five years later.

SUMMER: Ida hit, and took out every school in our community and I remember me crying. I cried in front of grown men 'cause I was mad that they were trying to tell me that there was a possibility that they wouldn't have education where I lived. And then it happened and I was like, whoa, they messed this up. They like, I couldn't have handled the truth if they'd have told me five years I'd have then really thought they were crazy, right?

CARLYLE: And I mean that to her point, it was just all the changes were happening so fast, you know, she thought it was gonna be decades away and all of a sudden, all the schools were destroyed.

ADD RACHEL: She couldn’t even conceive it would be decades…let alone, you know

CARLYLE: yeah. So what's happening in Chauvin now? Are there, are their schools still closed?

RACHEL: my understanding is there were four or five schools there. And, uh, only one has plans to be rebuilt. Um, and otherwise all of them are gonna end up being in other places. And it's interesting 'cause now Summer's a, a principal at a school in Montague, which is just kind of the, a town over, but it's still not Chauvin, you know?

CARLYLE: and part of what you talked to Summer about too is, is how she's helping her students think about the future because she knows, like, it was a hard thing for her to grasp the these changes and how quickly they're happening.

And she wants them to start thinking about you know, do they want to stay or do they want to go? And if they want to stay, you know are there different kinds of avenues they could be exploring..

SUMMER: There's jobs that are here that people could have that would make a difference here, and some of it was about coastal erosion or do biology work. It got them thinking in other directions besides just the typical things that, you know, being a trawler or being a oysterman, or being a doctor or a teacher, you know, just those jobs that everybody just kind of does. Whereas like, let's branch out and think about other things that actually could help to save the community you live in.

RACHEL: Yeah, Summer's a gym. I love her so much. taught English for a while and I love that she had her students kind of process a lot of what was happening through writing.

You know, with Katrina, she had people keep diaries and she, herself is a poet. And the title of this, the project came from a poem of hers, which I love. Um, and I could, I could share the, the quote with you if you want, but yeah,

CARLYLE: Yeah. Tell us the quote!

RACHEL: Yeah, she says the, the line of her poem is we have learned a lot from the redfish that can still hang on and adapt no matter what the water, it finds itself in salty or fresh. And there's so many different things I love about that because I think it's, it's talking about like the water, salty or fresh. It's kind of this change that we're going to and adapting. It's very literal where she is. 'cause the brackish water, it's changing as the sea level rises of what water it is. But then there's also just kind of this wide, um, you know, a very diverse, um, people down here who are handling this in different ways.

And it doesn't matter why you think these are happening, these issues are happening. It doesn't matter, um, what your perspective is, where you're coming from, where you live, no matter what. We're all kind of like this school of redfish and we're having to figure out, adapt together. And that's, and that's what we have to do. No matter what the water that we're in, we have to kind of come together and figure these things.

CARLYLE: and I feel like, you know, something else that your your series really gets to is, is adaptability and also resilience, so I wanted to ask you about Reverend Harris. Um, he is just a, a hilarious guy. And also, um, you know, he really, he thinks about resilience in this really holistic way.

RACHEL: Mm-hmm. Yeah, I think, um, you know, some of the things he does are really practical in terms of talking about go bags and, um, making sure that he knows who's in his community outside of his congregation, that's gonna need to be checked in on if a storm's coming, um, handing out pamphlets, having a tool library.

But then there is also that kind of, you know, I, I think resilience could be a dirty word down here, but it is that inner resilience, um, that he, that he talks a lot about and has kind of, you know, really beautiful things to say about.

CARLYLE: Yeah, let's listen to it.

TAPE: Rev Harris: Spiritually, it's very, very, very important so that you'll be able to mentally, psychologically deal with whatever outcome is.

You know what I'm talking about and I realize that 'cause uh, it can be depressing, it could be hard when you lose everything. But if you get distorted with it, you know, it's just, it's hard to recover psychologically and emotionally and stuff like that.

You know, we have to understand that there are things that hurt, but, uh. Don't let it be so devastating to you that it destroy you, because all of the material things you know, can be replaced if you see it as just everything's wiped out, that I have no hope, no way else to do it. It could be more devastating for you.

So come back to that same question. You know, okay, God, this is where it is. What would you have me do now. economically, I can't come back and build a house that I had, but can I come back and build a small house? Should I. Can I clear my lot off and put a trailer on it off? So I, I try to get us to understand that we've gotta be detached to some degree from that type of stuff.

If we going to, to do well when we experience it and, and realizing that we live in an area that it's primed for that to happen, it's even more critical.

CARLYLE: I think that's such a powerful point that he makes that we need to maintain some space from all the stuff we own, the physical stuff. And I mean, Reverend Harris also talks about, um, that that was really helpful for him when their church was damaged in a storm.

RACHEL: The roof was actually ripped off. And Laura, which was a huge storm down there, um, and you know, he, he kind of had that perspective. He said, you know, the physical church is damaged, but that's not the church. And so church can still happen. And I think that perspective of his really helps him deal with the loss and, and talk to his congregation and, and the people he ministers to about it too.

REV HARRIS: As I listened to people saying their church was damaged, I took a different twist. I said the church wasn't damaged, it was just the building. So the church kept meeting and we kept having church in the parking lot. It. It was awesome. You know, and you could just pull up and park in the parking lot and we had somebody out there kind of helping direct the cars, the sound people put together a sound system that we used outside and we just just go out there and people just pull up and park in their cars, and we’d just have a regular church service.

Rachel: it was like a drive in movie theater!

Rev Harris: except without speakers hanging off your cars.

CARLYLE: I mean, that is a hard thing to practice though, because it's easy to be attached to the places and things we love. And I mean, a lot of times it's not just losing the stuff, but we're losing a way of life. And you, you hear that in your conversation with Monique, Tell us a little bit about Monique who’s from St Bernard Parish.

MONIQUE: There was just this freedom to do what you want and to like be barefoot for weeks and not have to comb my hair. I miss that like, rhythm of life. It's, it was so like simple, uncomplicated, no TV really, you know, I. Turn the air conditioner on only on Sunday and only 'cause we were going to church, which was the reason why I had to comb my hair, which I hated. (cries)

I'm sorry, I'm, it's like, um, when Katrina washed in, it really, it just like flipped life upside down. I. And you know, my grandmother was able to go back to her land and some of the other elders were, but all the elders have passed at this point, pretty much. And I think that that like community and, you know, collective survival, the sharing of the labor and like the abundance, uh. It just doesn't exist anymore. In that way,

RACHEL: Yeah, that's, there's a lot to unpack in that one. It's, um, it's, I mean, I, I think she says so beautifully. So many, um, so many things that are challenges. Part of the challenges of what we're up against right now, you know. My interview with her was really about thinking about migrating communities and that communities are gonna have to shift. And it's something that Monique's really thinking about in an interesting way in terms of how do you keep home with you whenever you're doing that, and how do you, um, figure out how to be, uh, home and as long as you can, I think you can get something out of that.

CARLYLE: Right. And I mean, she's bought land, uh, as she describes it, north of I 10. Right. In order to, to kind of have a place to be safer,

RACHEL: Yeah. And you know, north of I 10 is this thing. I don't, I don't know if it's the same in across the state, but I know definitely in Lafayette, Kana area, like north of I 10, is where it's safe to buy and safe to be. And so it's kind of, you know, she laughs about that. But, um, but you know, she has a lot of her, um, her Homa relatives and Homa, meaning the indigenous tribe, not.

The place, um, who are affected by storms that are coming and, and they're kind of scattered in different areas along the coast, and then also her community and New Orleans that she's built over the years. And so she's thought a lot about when a storm's coming, where do you go? And, um, thinking, and she's, and she's created this place in Arville that is gonna be a sanctuary and really an amazing resource with solar panels.

And, um, also just a place that people can come and recharge their phones on their way to where they're going or if they need to crash their night when they are figuring out what's gonna happen because the storm's coming or you just need water or whatever it is, there's a place that you can go that you know you have a safe place to go to.

CARLYLEL Yeah. And, you know, listening to her story, I was just reflecting on the fact that, you know, the state of Louisiana has known for 20 years or so that migration is gonna be a necessary thing for a lot of people who live in South Louisiana. Um, but there's no funding for it, there's no infrastructure for it, there's no agency in charge of it.

Um, and that's true, you know, uh, you know, generally with our country at large too. And so, I mean, I just think about how it's, it's kind of put in, left in the hands of people like Monique to, to take this on and think, you know, she's thinking beyond herself too, making plans, not just like, where am I gonna be safe, but like, where can I provide a place for a larger community?

So, I mean, do you think about her as kind of a leader in this way?

RACHEL: Oh, a hundred percent. I mean, it's like you said, she is, she's. Not waiting for someone else to take it on, which I will say the indigenous communities down here, I feel like are the leaders in this space so much of just saying like, you guys aren't, there's, there's no help coming for us. We're figuring this out, and it's really, really inspiring.

MONIQUE: Post Katrina My family land in St. Bernard was under 11 feet of water when the surge came in, and I think that. I was just like, this is done. We're not gonna be able to be here. I really felt that way that there was something that died. I really was an advocate for like, okay, friends, let's all buy some land north of I I 10. Okay, family. Let's figure out a safe place for us all to go to. We gotta kind of like cut our losses, and the older I get, the more I recognize that we have a right to remain and reclaim. I need to have a foot in the sinking swamp over here. I don't wanna just go because this is home.

… And I think that my decision to invest in this small little 12 acre plot is maybe in the hopes that others will, will see that maybe we can retreat and return and maybe we can have relationships in other places. And have community that's north of I 10, and maybe some people will stay and maybe some people will always return home…but you know you can always go to Praires de Femmes.

RACHEL: I loved hearing her thought process and kind of how there's community that's helped her make these decisions. And, you know, one of the things I really love is part of her inspiration is, um, a member of the Homa community from years ago who she's never met. Um, but the story that, that this woman Rosalina, she went ahead and bought a bunch of land knowing that her people were gonna need a place to go. And so that's something that's always been in her mind.

And so I love that she's taking this experience of a community and this powerful woman of stories that she's. Been passed down to her and really putting that into effect and, and saying like, yes, I am. I'm gonna also make sure that my people have a place to go.

CARLYLE: yeah and then you met somebody who instead of relocating because of rising sea levels and land loss, um, has just figured out how to safely stay put. So, tell me about Buddy.

RACHEL: Yeah, buddy is, uh, I, I feel like he's like the uncle you wish he had. In a lot of ways. He's just so endearing and everyone loves him. but he is just a sweetheart. He's 80, he might be 81 now, I'm not sure. And he, uh, traveled the world. He got into computers early and traveled the world working on them, and then just got tired of all the traveling he did and moved back home to like South Central, I would call it Louisiana. And so, you know, he was living at home and he, a friend came up to him and was like, Hey, I have some debt I need to take care of. I have this trailer and this lease, um, you know, will you buy it and, and help me settle my debt? And so he did. And then, um, I feel like Buddy should take over what happened from there.

BUDDY: when I drove out here, I drove up on the levee and boom, there was nothing but water. I said, Lord, I called him and said, he said, oh, it's in the field.

Over there. The farmer pulled it out. I said, well, thanks for telling me.

RACHEL: so it was flooded the first time you came out?

BUDDY: oh yeah…yeah

RACHEL: so after a while, um, the trailer kind of couldn't take going over the levee back and forth when it flooded anymore, and it was time to build a new home.

So I think, um, you know, in south Louisiana and probably a lot of places that deal with water, when you drive around, you see a lot of houses that have been raised up on stilts, um, to help prevent flooding so that, you know, the water comes in and the house is raised higher. But for a buddy, he really didn't wanna do stilts. He, um, was born with a, a leg shorter than the other. And so he knew the stairs would be a problem. He didn't wanna do an elevator for various reasons. And so he had seen a camp in, um, the same area that had created what's really called an amphibious home, A house that floats.

And he decided to do the same, but with his home,

BUDDY: They think I'm nuts, I guess, you know, really. I mean, who would want to live in a floating house in the middle of the woods with. With alligators and snakes, you know, but it was only the practical solution for me. It seemed very logical what I did to me.

CARLYLE: that's so cool. And he's inspired other people to build similar houses, right?

RACHEL: Yeah, now there's about 40 structures. There's the, the landing there, um, where it's a restaurant and boat landing that is floating. Um, and it's just, it's really amazing.

CARLYLE: Has there been like a big flood that's tested all of these floating structures? Yeah.

RACHEL: yeah, actually in 2011, there was a big flood there. Um, and a lot of the stilted homes actually ended up flooding because they weren't built high enough for that particular flood. Whereas amphibious homes, they're not built to a certain level per se. They just go up and go down. And so, um, as long as your poles are high enough, you can go high enough.

CARLYLE: Let’s hear Buddy talking bout that flood.

RACHEL: Yeah. How did the floating houses fare during that, that flood?

BUDDY: I don't think any of them flooded. None of 'em did.

I'm not going to flood when it floods. I'm here just to make sure everything goes right. I mean, there's a mental benefit. For me, it would be a crisis probably for anybody, a lot of other people, but they don't go with the flow. You know the old saying, go with the flow. Well, that's pretty much what you gotta do on the river.

I mean, you're not gonna stop the river. This is a way to live with the threat of water.

CARLYLE: Oh, he's great. And I love this question you ask buddy.

RACHEL: Why do you think you're the person who was like, I'm just gonna live here full time and I'm gonna make my house float.

[00:15:19] Buddy: I don't know. You know, I have no idea. My friend Tommy, we were just talking about what we did, how our lives had played out.

He's 80 as well as I am, and, uh, he, he is said, well, you took the road less traveled. I, I said, yeah, but it just happened to me. I'm normal. I, I don't consider myself a wild man that lives on the river. I don't consider myself different from other people, but it just happened and I'm glad it did happen. It, it was a good way to live my life.

It was peaceful after traveling the world, working in Manila and Caracas and these big cities, it's just, it brings me back to my childhood. I was raised on a dairy farm. Outside of Bunky where nature was just nature. I mean, it was just part of us. And I get that same feeling here that I'm, I'm just part of nature out here.

It's, it's a nice feeling.

CARLYLE: I just think that's something that everybody you talk to really, you know, in a beautiful way discusses is that deep connection to place.

RACHEL: Yeah for sure. The environment and the nature here is just so beautiful and so special. Um, and it's not. It's not just that, it's also the people.

And so I think that's kind of the sentiment with, you know, across the board, the five different people I speak with, because that's why, that's why we're finding solutions to stay here.

That's why we don't wanna leave. And I think that's the thing a lot of people not from here don't understand is, you know, there's always the question of why don't you just leave? Why don't you just move? And I think more people are understanding it more as disasters are happening elsewhere. But it's because this is your home and you sh. It's not, it's not something that can be replicated anywhere else, and it's really special and, um, you can't, you can't really move a culture somewhere else. That's part of the receiving migrating community thing is figuring out how do we make room for cultures and, and make it feel more like a home as a receiving community.

But, um, you know, it's something that I think a lot of these people speak really eloquently about, probably more than I am right now, about why, why it's worth staying, why it's worth figuring out how to adapt, why it's worth figuring out how to mitigate the solutions. Um. Prolong our ability to stay where we wanna be for as long as we can.

We know that at some point we're not gonna be able to in a lot of places, in a lot of situations. Um, and so coming to terms with that, but also saying, but I'm gonna, I'm gonna fight to be here as long as I can because it's worth it. And I think that's an important message for everyone. And I think it's also important to just say that as the people living here and acknowledge that that is what you're doing, that this is important.

It's who you are. It's part of who you are, it's part of your history.

CARLYLE: Yeah. And I just, I loved meeting these five people and I loved hearing their stories and I found them all really hopeful and inspirational.

RACHEL: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

CARLYLE: Well, thank you so much, Rachel.

Yeah. Thank you so much for having me, Carlyle. It's been really great to visit the stories with you.

The finding gave the EPA the authority to regulate vehicle tailpipe emissions.
Manufacturers could get credit for each EV they sell in a model year, bringing up the average fuel economy for all vehicles sold that year.
But the likely end to tailpipe standards, expected next year, and the lowering of CAFE standards will ultimately make it easier for the manufacturers.
This is really historic, wiping them off the books.” Alson added that reversing the linkage between CAFE and EPA standards is an easy target, too, since there’s no formal legal or statutory mandate to use fuel economy standards to address tailpipe emissions.","Electric vehicle advocates are bracing for the Trump administration’s anticipated reversal of the coupling more than a decade ago of vehicle fuel economy standards with EPA goals to reduce tailpipe emissions.

The Transportation Department’s upcoming rewrite of Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards — paired with the 2025 reconciliation law’s elimination of fines for not meeting the standards, rollback of EV tax credits and other reversals of long-standing emissions rules — is expected to further water down federal support for the EV market.

“All of these things combined will have some impact on the deployment of EVs in the near term,” Albert Gore, executive director of the Zero Emission Transportation Association, said in an interview. “And these are difficult investments to make.”

The CAFE standards, which require automakers to meet an average fuel economy level for all the cars and light trucks they sell in a model year, were established in 1975 to reduce the nation’s reliance on foreign oil and ease costs for consumers in response to the 1973 oil embargo.

The EPA changed that in 2009 with its endangerment finding, a determination that greenhouse gas emissions pose a public health threat and thus need to be regulated by the agency. The finding gave the EPA the authority to regulate vehicle tailpipe emissions.

Jeff Alson, a former EPA senior engineer and policy adviser who helped establish the vehicle emission regulations, said EPA then worked with the DOT to “harmonize” tailpipe emission and CAFE standards to ease the impact on automakers.

Manufacturers could get credit for each EV they sell in a model year, bringing up the average fuel economy for all vehicles sold that year. Companies whose fleets fell short of the CAFE standard could face big fines.

“[Automakers] can kind of meet them with the same kind of technologies,” Alson said. “Even though they were different laws and had different objectives and all that, in terms of the impacts on the manufacturers, they were pretty much the same.”

But the Trump administration appears poised to change both sides of the balance: tailpipe emissions rules and the fuel economy standard that helps meet those rules.

The administration in June released an interpretive rule that prohibited the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the agency that sets CAFE standards, from considering “alternative fuel” vehicles, like EVs and hydrogen-powered vehicles, and associated credits when setting the standards — a move that essentially decouples NHTSA’s CAFE standards from EPA tailpipe standards, in theory making it much harder to achieve either. But the likely end to tailpipe standards, expected next year, and the lowering of CAFE standards will ultimately make it easier for the manufacturers.

Republicans in Congress and some automakers, who lauded delinking, say the Biden administration’s ratcheting up of the goals unfairly pushed automakers toward producing more EVs and eliminated consumer choice.

“This is a positive development and important clarity from the Department of Transportation,” the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, a trade association for car makers, said in a statement about the interpretive rule. “In multiple comments to NHTSA during the Biden administration, automakers said NHTSA’s standards were ‘improperly predicated’ on alternative fuel vehicles.”

‘Historic’ reversals

The Trump administration has already taken steps to reverse the Biden administration’s EPA tailpipe emissions standards and the endangerment finding on which the rules are based.

“The first Trump administration didn’t even dream of wiping out all the standards,” Alson said. “They were just going to weaken them and slow them down. This is really historic, wiping them off the books.”

Alson added that reversing the linkage between CAFE and EPA standards is an easy target, too, since there’s no formal legal or statutory mandate to use fuel economy standards to address tailpipe emissions.

“It was always a linkage based on common sense,” he said. “It’s just a basic scientific fact … every time you burn a balance of a gallon of gasoline, you’re going to get about 20 pounds of carbon dioxide. That’s how people like me ended up linking them under the Obama administration and the Biden administration.”

Impact on EVs

The EV market, having grown over the past few years thanks in part to the EV tax credit and Biden administration regulations, has slowed since Republicans took control of Congress and the White House.

Ford Motor Co. CEO Jim Farley said in Detroit in September, just before the EV tax credits were set to expire, that he “wouldn’t be surprised” if EV sales fell to a market share of 5 percent after the credit ended from around 10 percent to 12 percent at the time.

Ellen Hughes-Cromwick, senior visiting fellow in the climate and energy program at the left-center think tank Third Way and a former chief economist at both Ford and the Commerce Department, said in an email that she had estimated the EV industry would reach a 50 percent market share by 2030 with the tax credits and other federal incentives.

Now, she estimates 30 percent could be ambitious, especially in light of rising risks of recession during the second half of this decade.

“Our legacy automotive companies are incorporating new headwinds and tailwinds. For headwinds, the elimination of EV tax credits for vehicle buyers has incentivized a shift to delay or even cancel EV product plans,” Hughes-Cromwick said. “At the same time, easier regulations on fuel economy and emissions looks like it incentivizes the companies to amp up profitable SUV and truck production.”

She added that “only time will tell” on the prognosis as automakers await finalized CAFE standards, emission regulations and tariff policy.

In spite of slowing EV growth and rollback of federal support, Gore estimates global demand for EVs will still drive market interest in the United States.

“The CAFE standard is not necessarily meant to push the ceiling higher but to raise the floor and ensure that automakers who are not moving quickly to manufacture in high volumes lots of fuel-efficient vehicles are nonetheless continuing to improve over time,” Gore said.

According to an International Energy Agency outlook in May, EV sales topped 17 million worldwide in 2024, rising by more than 25 percent. China continued to dominate the market.

“The return on the invested capital, although there’s less of it out there, which makes it a bit riskier from a cost of capital perspective, is much higher. It’s because the market is less competitive, but there is a lot of demand,” Gore said. “I think people don’t want to be left out of technological innovation and a vision of the future.”",https://rollcall.com/app/uploads/2025/10/blink_charging_545_031124.jpeg,N,,2025-10-27 15:19:52.625036

A regional water supplier in North Texas discussed water infrastructure needs and a proposed constitutional amendment that advocates say is part of the solution.

The North Texas Municipal Water District (NTMWD) runs the Wylie Water Treatment Plant, which sits on over 500 acres of land in Collin County.

“The North Texas Municipal Water District is a wholesale supplier of water, wastewater and solid waste to all of the cities and suburbs north and east of Dallas,” said David Kelly, the government affairs and special projects manager at NTMWD. “We are responsible for attaining raw water rights, treating and transporting raw water to a city’s take point, and then they’re responsible for distributing that water to their citizens.”

Kelly said cities in the plant’s service area currently distribute water to roughly 2.3 million residents.

“It’s one of the fastest growing areas in the entire country, and we’re adding about 75,000 people a year to our service area, so the biggest challenge that we have is keeping up with that growth and getting new water supplies to make sure that we are able to keep the Texas miracle going,” he said.

The population growth is sparking concerns about water shortages, failing infrastructure, droughts and floods. State lawmakers voted to put Proposition 4 on the November ballot, proposing a constitutional amendment that would allocate $1 billion a year for the next 20 years toward water infrastructure projects. Kelly says rural and disadvantaged areas would benefit as well.

“It’s going to go to the state and then be able to come back to the Texas Water Development Board to create projects like this here,” Kelly said.

Opponents of Proposition 4 argue that transferring the oversight of the revenue from lawmakers to the board would limit transparency and accountability. They also say it lacks adequate safeguards against environmental hazards. Advocates, who held a recent discussion during a Texas Tribune panel session, hope voters will support the proposition.

“The Legislature is recognizing what the importance of reliable water infrastructure is to Texas communities, and that’s why they’re submitting Proposition 4 to the choice of the voters,” said Jeremy Mazur, director of infrastructure and natural resources policy at Texas 2036, a nonprofit public policy organization.

Getting large load interconnection right is a generational opportunity that’s key to winning the AI race, reshoring American manufacturing, and keeping electricity reliable and affordable for everyone.","On October 23, 2025, the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) directed the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to conduct a rulemaking to assert jurisdiction over load interconnections to the bulk electric transmission system and establish standardized procedures for the interconnection of large loads.1 The Directive included an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking (ANOPR) that sets forth the legal justification for asserting jurisdiction over transmission-level load interconnections and fourteen principles that should inform FERC’s rulemaking process. The Secretary has directed FERC to take “final action” on the Directive no later than April 30, 2026.

Citing “unprecedented and extraordinary” electricity demand driven by the rapid proliferation of data centers, onshoring of manufacturing, and trends in electrification, the Directive would have FERC address the lack of standardized rules governing how large loads—which it preliminarily defines as greater than 20 MW2 —are interconnected at the transmission level. The Directive issued shortly after the Senate confirmation of two new Republican FERC commissioners, Chair Laura V. Swett and Commissioner David LaCerte. Swett and LaCerte are the first appointments of the second Trump Administration to the agency and provide Republicans with a majority for the first time since August 2021.3 The new makeup of the agency along the Directive’s ambitious timeline suggest that FERC is likely to move quickly to address the issue of large load interconnection. Commissioner David Rosner, the agency’s prior Acting Chairman, has already expressed eagerness to work on the Secretary’s proposal.4

The ANOPR provides FERC with a critical opportunity to clarify FERC policy on large load interconnections. Although FERC has held a technical conference on the co-location of large loads5 and instituted a Federal Power Act (FPA) Section 206 proceeding regarding co-locating large loads in PJM Interconnection, L.L.C.,6 FERC has not provided comprehensive guidance on the process, cost allocation requirements, or timeline that transmission providers must follow when addressing large load requests. Additionally, the limited orders that FERC issued under the leadership of former Chairman Mark Christie appeared skeptical of the ability of the grid to accommodate loads without impairing service to other customers, including certain well-publicized orders thwarting efforts to co-locate large loads with existing generation in PJM.7 The ANOPR provides FERC with an opportunity to articulate a coherent policy framework that creates a path for the interconnection of large loads that recognizes the strategic and economic importance of large loads while maintaining reliability and resource adequacy.

Section 403 Authority

The Directive is issued pursuant to Section 403 of the Department of Energy Organization Act, which allows the Secretary of Energy to “propose rules, regulations, and statements of policy of general applicability with respect to any function within the jurisdiction of the [FERC].”8 The legal impact of the Directive is, however, somewhat limited. FERC is not required to adopt any DOE proposal. It must only “consider” such proposal and take final action on the proposal in an “expeditious manner” and “in accordance with such reasonable time limits as may be set by the Secretary…”9

The directive marks the second time10 that the current Secretary has invoked his Section 403 authority following his August 29, 2025 directive for FERC to terminate its long-running proceeding addressing proposed updates to its policy statement on the certification of new interstate natural gas facilities.11 FERC followed the August 2025 Directive by issuing an order terminating its interstate natural gas facilities certificate proceeding just 14 days later.12 Prior to the August 2025 Directive, the DOE Secretary had not issued a Section 403 directive to FERC since former Secretary Rick Perry directed FERC to consider action to require transmission providers to compensate generation resources with on-site fuel supplies.13 Following extensive and widespread opposition to the Secretary Perry’s directive, FERC declined to adopt his proposed rule and terminated the proceeding.14

Jurisdiction Over Transmission-Level Interconnections

Parties are likely to contest whether FERC has jurisdiction over the interconnection of large loads to the transmission system. Historically, FERC has declined to assert jurisdiction over load interconnections in deference to the states’ authority over retail sales. In anticipation of these arguments, the Secretary’s Directive asserts that the interconnection of large loads to the transmission system falls “squarely within the [FERC’s] jurisdiction.”15 The ANOPR draws upon the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in New York v. FERC, in which the Court upheld FERC’s decision to exercise jurisdiction over unbundled retail sales but declined jurisdiction over bundled retail sales.16 The Court explained that “[t]he unbundled retail transmissions targeted by FERC are indeed transmissions of ‘electric energy in interstate commerce,’” subject to FERC jurisdiction and “[t]here is no language in the [FPA] limiting FERC’s transmission jurisdiction to the wholesale market…”17 It found that FERC had “discretion to decline to assert such jurisdiction [over bundled retail transactions] … in part because of the complicated nature of the jurisdictional issues.”18 The ANOPR questions FERC’s decision not to exercise jurisdiction over bundled retail sales, by citing to Justice Clarence Thomas’s dissent in which he disagreed with the Court’s conclusion that FERC could decline such jurisdiction since “FERC has jurisdiction over all interstate transmission, regardless of the type of transaction with which it is associated…”19

The ANOPR also finds support for the Secretary’s jurisdictional assertion in FERC’s generator interconnection framework. The ANOPR explains that in Order No. 2003 FERC found that generator interconnection is a “critical component of open access transmission service” over which it has jurisdiction to establish a standardized set of non-discriminatory procedures that transmission providers are required to adopt.20 Although the ANOPR does not directly compare the pre-Order No. 2003 generator interconnection process in which generators faced an “inefficient,” “case-by-case approach” to interconnect that “frequently result in complex, time consuming technical dispute about interconnection feasibility, cost, and cost responsibility,”21 the parallels between such process and current load interconnection processes are not difficult to draw.

From this background, the ANOPR identifies four legal justifications for FERC to assert jurisdiction over large load interconnections:

Load interconnection are, like generator interconnections, a “critical component of open access transmission service” over which FERC has jurisdiction.22 FERC’s exclusive jurisdiction over interstate transmission service would appear, based upon the discussion of New York and FERC’s generator interconnection framework, to be the primary basis that DOE believes FERC has jurisdiction over large load interconnections.

Load interconnections directly affect FERC-jurisdictional wholesale electricity rates, for which courts have found FERC has jurisdiction.23 Although the ANOPR does not elaborate on how FERC’s “affecting” jurisdiction extends to large load interconnections, courts have approved FERC’s assertion of jurisdiction over other entities that were engaged in activities that touched on state jurisdiction. For example, courts have found FERC has jurisdiction to establish rates for demand response participating in wholesale markets and to require states to allow energy storage resources to participate in wholesale markets, including by interconnecting at the distribution level.24

FERC’s assertion of jurisdiction over large load interconnections will not infringe on states’ authority over retail electricity sales or the siting of generating facilities.25 The ANOPR explains that while states have authority over retail sales and the siting, expansion, and modification of generating facilities, FERC’s adoption of processes governing large load interconnections will not impinge on this authority since the ANOPR does not address retail sales or the siting, expansion, and modification of generation facilities.

Finally, “[a]ny contrary view of the proposed reforms conflicts with the FPA’s core purposes.”26 The ANOPR’s point appears to be that that a core purpose of the FPA is that FERC shall be vested with exclusive jurisdiction to oversee the rates, terms, and conditions of transmission service and large loads interconnecting to the transmission system intend to obtain such service and its associated benefits. The interconnection of large loads thus falls within FERC’s jurisdiction.

Principles for Large Load Interconnection Processes

The ANOPR sets forth 14 broad principles that “should inform [FERC’s] rulemaking procedures.”27 Some of these principles may be relatively uncontroversial (e.g., utilities serving large loads must meet all applicable North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) reliability standards and transmission provider tariff requirements).28 But many other principles are likely to generate significant comment from utilities, large loads, generators, and consumers.

The 14 principles that the ANOPR instructs should inform FERC’s rulemaking are as follows:29

Limit FERC’s jurisdiction to interconnections directly to transmission facilities, consistent with FERC’s seven-factor test, to avoid infringing on state regulation of distribution facilities.30 FERC historically has applied the seven-factor test to evaluate whether facilities constitute transmission facilities subject to FERC’s jurisdiction or local distribution facilities subject to the exclusive authority of the states.

Apply the load interconnection process to new loads greater than 20 MW (and hybrid facilities with greater than 20 MW load).

Study large loads jointly with generation to promote efficient siting and minimize costly network upgrades.

Adopt standardized deposits, readiness criteria, and withdrawal penalties to deter speculative large loads and improve queue management.

Study hybrid facilities (i.e., facilities consisting of both load and generation) based on their net injection/withdrawal rights to encourage co-location and efficient grid use.

Require system-protection equipment for hybrid projects to prevent unauthorized injections or withdrawals, with potential penalties for violations.

Expedite studies (potentially as fast as 60-days) for large loads that agree to be curtailable.

Assign full responsibility for network-upgrade costs to interconnecting loads, with potential crediting or recovery mechanisms.

Provide large loads the option-to-build interconnection facilities and certain network upgrades, consistent with the generator option-to-build.

Require SSR/RMR-type studies when generators partially suspend operations to serve new load, ensuring reliability before suspension.

Charge for transmission service based on withdrawal rights to reflect the capacity and energy transmitted to serve such load.

Utilities serving large loads should be responsible for ancillary services based on peak demand without any consideration of co-located generation; however, any co-located generation should be fully compensated for the provision of ancillary services.

Establish transition plans for pending large load interconnections under study.

Require compliance with NERC standards, including possible new registration categories or modified standards to protect the bulk-power system.

The 14 principles set forth in the ANOPR appear designed to push FERC in the direction of resolving certain issues related to the interconnection and integration of large loads that already are being hotly contested before the FERC. For instance, the principle that facilities be studied and charged for transmission based on a net basis appears to put DOE’s weight behind parties that have argued that large loads should be permitted to serve a portion of their demand behind the meter without being subjected to transmission charges. At the same time, the ANOPR appears to make a concession to those parties that have argued that certain charges—such as ancillary services—should be allocated based on the gross capacity of a large load even if a portion may be served by onsite generation, although the ANOPR also confirms that onsite generation should have the opportunity to supply and be compensated for these services.

The ANOPR seeks comment on many of the 14 principles, including how to define large loads,31 what financial commitments or withdrawal penalties should apply to large load interconnections processes,32 and whether expedited study processes should be available for curtailable large loads.33 If FERC moves forward with a large load interconnection rulemaking, interested parties will have the opportunity to comment on other principles and present alternatives for FERC’s consideration.

It will now be on FERC to take up the ANOPR. While FERC has discretion regarding the substance of any orders that it issues in response to DOE’s directive, FERC will need to move quickly if it is to meet the DOE’s deadline of taking “final action” on the proposal by April 2026. Given that DOE’s proposal is cast as an ANOPR—which typically precedes the issuance of a notice of proposed rulemaking and final rule—it seems likely that any actions that are taken by FERC by April 2026 may represent the first steps in a longer rulemaking process. Nevertheless, an order by the FERC articulating its view on the principles included in the ANOPR would represent a milestone in the FERC’s articulation of a policy respecting the interconnection of large loads.

USW International President

Edwin Sanchez had the seniority he needed to bid into a higher-paying position in the control room at the oil refinery in Texas City, Texas, where he’d worked for more than 15 years.

But Sanchez, lighthearted and sociable, seemed to prefer the company of his close-knit, 30-person unit responsible for a range of duties inside and outside the sprawling facility.

Sanchez, a member of United Steelworkers (USW) Local 13-1, showed up for his shifts like clockwork. And then, one day, he didn’t show up at all.

Concerned co-workers ultimately learned that Immigration and Customs Enforcement decided to deport Sanchez, whom local police detained after a traffic stop, even though he had an up-to-date work permit.

His deportation to Honduras—a country he hadn’t seen since leaving as a child nearly four decades earlier—occurred in March. The loss angered fellow union members, who fought to hold open Sanchez’s job during his months-long detention, and it underscored the heavy toll that Donald Trump’s dragnet exacts not only on deportees and their families but on the workplaces and industries they leave behind.

“It just leaves a hole,” observed Brandi Sanders-Lausch, president of Local 13-1, recalling how months of uncertainty about Sanchez’s fate affected about 1,000 union workers at the refinery.

“They were definitely distracted and probably a little uncomfortable,” she said of Sanchez’s co-workers, especially members of his unit who worked most closely with him. “They had questions. They didn’t understand. Everyone still talks about him.”

In all, the nation so far lost more than a million foreign-born workers like Sanchez amid Trump’s mass deportation campaign.

It’s already causing labor shortages that drive up employer costs and delay work, according to new data from the Federal Reserve. It’s ultimately going to balloon the federal deficit, hinder growth and lower Americans’ standard of living, according to a study by researchers at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, one of whom explained that “fewer people means a smaller economy.”

The campaign against immigrants puts large swaths of the economy at risk, not merely by decimating the work force but by depriving the nation of people with the skills and knowledge essential for operating key industries and keeping them viable for the long term.

For example, Sanchez held a trusted role at the refinery, a veritable small city, where workers refine up to 631,000 gallons of crude oil a day for gasoline, petrochemicals, fuel oil, propane and other products needed by various kinds of businesses across the country.

Sanchez graduated from a local high school and completed a process technology degree at a community college to prepare for his work as an operator, which involved scaling ladders, monitoring gauges, performing maintenance and checking for leaks, among other responsibilities, Sanders said.

He continued his education on the job. Both the USW and the company invested in Sanchez on an ongoing basis, providing the safety and other training that empowered his work.

In return, Sanchez invested himself in his work and in his colleagues. He was a dependable, conscientious team player, with an upbeat personality that helped to lighten 12-hour shifts and the overtime that often followed, Sanders said, calling him a favorite among his co-workers.

“They all became really good friends,” she said, noting that Sanchez earned respect for his dedication to picket-line duty during the USW’s 2015 unfair labor practice strike against big oil and his commitment to watching others’ backs in a high-risk work environment.

“You can’t replace a person like that,” Sanders said. “You feel that loss. It’s almost like someone passing away.”

In his mid-30s, unmarried, with no children, Sanchez ended up relying on friends to sell his assets so he’d have some means of supporting himself in Honduras. He also accessed his retirement account, providing additional funds.

But co-workers never saw him again.

Instead of helping to meet America’s energy needs, he’s now figuring out his next steps in an unfamiliar country that has no oil industry, let alone a need for skilled refinery workers.

“He doesn’t speak Spanish,” Sanders said. “He still calls and checks in with everybody from time to time. His friends are here.”

Just like Sanchez, José Galo parlayed hard work and a union contract into a good middle-class life.

But it’s all in pieces now. Galo—who made his way to the U.S. on his own at 14, sometimes sleeping on a couch and skipping meals for lack of money—says he has little choice but to return to Honduras following the deportation of his wife, Karla.

Galo, a U.S. citizen and member of USW Local 1693 in Lexington, Ky., accompanied his wife, also a native of Honduras, to a routine check-in with immigration officials in June. Thirty minutes later, a woman returned to the waiting room and told Galo, “She’s no longer here.”

“They took her out the back,” recalled Galo, a manufacturing worker. He made a brief trip to Honduras shortly thereafter, taking the couple’s 6-year-old son, a U.S. citizen, so he could live with his mother.

Galo said he’s done his best to contribute to America, joining the ranks of the manufacturing workers who built the country and standing in solidarity with fellow USW members.

He availed himself of the advantages that the USW and other unions have provided all of their members, including members of various immigrant groups, for decades: good wages, affordable benefits, safe working conditions and a brighter future.

Galo bought a house and a car, willingly paid taxes and started a lawn care business to explore his entrepreneurial side. He liked nothing more than greeting his son when he walked through the door at the end of a long shift.

Now, his hardships cast a pall over the factory floor, where Galo says his co-workers, a second family, try to cheer him up even though they share his grief. He knows he won’t be seeing them much longer, even though he’s daunted by the prospect of starting over in a country as disadvantaged as when he left decades ago.

Renewable America addressed them by mobilizing survey teams and partnering with Humboldt Water to remap boundaries, adjusting the project layout and road design accordingly.

Through these efforts, Renewable America reduced access road construction costs by 75% (over $180,000) and accelerated the production timeline by six weeks while maintaining compliance, performance and energy yield.

“This project is an example of how careful planning and collaboration can overcome unexpected hurdles without compromising cost or schedule,” said Ardi Arian, president and CEO of Renewable America. “We’re proud to deliver a solar and storage portfolio that strengthens local energy reliability while supporting California’s clean energy goals.”

Therefore, the EPA does not believe it is necessary to include air quality regulatory provisions in SIPs that limit the strategic use of prescribed fires.
EPA’s policy guidance instructs its regional offices to engage with local, state, tribal, and federal partners to develop approaches, consistent with the CAA, that will not limit the use of prescribed fires.
EPA’s policy guidance comes on the heels of Administrator Lee Zeldin’s March 12 announcement that the EPA was revisiting its ‘Exceptional Events’ rulemaking to prioritize the allowance of prescribed fires in SIPs.","Last week, the Environmental Protection Agency issued its “Policy on Provisions to Allow Wildland Prescribed Fire in Clean Air Act State Implementation Plans” in accordance with Section 4 (Strengthening Wildfire Mitigation) of Executive Order 14308, ‘Empowering Commonsense Wildfire and Response.’

This policy guidance comes in the wake of the EPA completing its largest-ever wildfire hazardous material removal effort in response to the January 2025 Los Angeles County fires. In particular, EPA’s policy guidance directs its 10 regional offices to work with local, state, tribal, and federal partners to remove barriers in State Implementation Plans (SIPs) that discourage prescribed fires.

SIPs are used by a state, tribe, territory, or local air district to implement, maintain, and enforce the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) and to fulfill other requirements under the Clean Air Act (CAA). For example, several states have rules incorporated into their SIPs that include statewide or areawide provisions relating to the use of prescribed fires. However, under the CAA and the EPA’s ‘Exceptional Events Rule,’ prescribed fires are eligible to be treated as an exceptional event in which air quality data resulting from these strategic fires does not need to be taken into account when determining whether a particular area meets NAAQS. Therefore, the EPA does not believe it is necessary to include air quality regulatory provisions in SIPs that limit the strategic use of prescribed fires.

EPA’s policy guidance instructs its regional offices to engage with local, state, tribal, and federal partners to develop approaches, consistent with the CAA, that will not limit the use of prescribed fires. In addition, these offices must also collaborate with state air agencies to evaluate both existing provisions already incorporated into SIPs and proposed provisions for inclusion into SIPs to ensure they are consistent with the CAA and do not limit the strategic application of wildland prescribed fires. Moreover, EPA’s regional offices will also encourage air agencies to collaborate with wildland prescribed burners, including state, tribal, and federal agencies, to implement smoke management strategies to minimize health impacts during prescribed fires and to promote recordkeeping of prescribed fire activities, which will enable more effective coordination and collaboration on smoke and air quality management.

EPA’s policy guidance comes on the heels of Administrator Lee Zeldin’s March 12 announcement that the EPA was revisiting its ‘Exceptional Events’ rulemaking to prioritize the allowance of prescribed fires in SIPs.

What are Connecticut's plans for its energy future?
Bottom line, you pile all these together, you've got an absolute target on offshore wind.

In a sense, the biggest issue here is that you have all kinds of entities preparing for future power needs.","Connecticut had high hopes for wind and solar energy. Changes at the federal level have cast clouds over those plans.

WSHU’s Ebong Udoma spoke with CT Mirror’s Jan Ellen Spiegel to discuss her article, “CT needs to plan for its energy future, but the view is cloudy,” as part of the collaborative podcast Long Story Short. Read Jan’s story here.

WSHU: Hello, Jan. This summer, the Trump administration issued a stop-work order on Revolution Wind, the offshore wind project, which is backed by Connecticut and Rhode Island. Is that what prompted you to explore this issue more?

JES: Actually, no. It was one, certainly one factor. But this was already well underway. There have been a series of moves by Donald Trump in the second administration, starting from day one, that clearly were designed to, shall we say, impede, if not outright kill, certain types of renewable energy, most prominently offshore wind, to some degree, onshore wind and solar. And we were all forewarned. He slow walked this stuff in the first administration, and with a variety of executive orders on day one, you could see he was coming for him again, and he was coming for them much stronger.

The stop-work order on Revolution Wind, which didn't come until the end of August, and the subsequent stop-work order on another offshore project in New York, are more closely symptoms of all the other things he'd done, and he had done a number of things.

WSHU: Let's take a step back. What are Connecticut's plans for its energy future?

JES: Well, what they are and maybe going forward could be very different. First of all, there was a lot of emphasis being put on offshore wind, and certainly getting this project up and running was critical. If you may recall, there was an earlier offshore wind project that eventually got canceled as a result of the pandemic and increased prices and whatnot, and Connecticut had backed off on any additional stuff. Whether there would be more remains to be seen. The state itself, like almost every other state in New England and many other states in the northeast, has clean energy goals, as does Connecticut, and there are different ways that those can be attained. But offshore wind in particular was a huge component, because you can get massive amounts of energy and energy akin to one of the units in the Millstone nuclear power station.

Plus, there were some other things underway designed to get onshore wind down from Maine, which has been a goal now for 15 years; it just hasn't really materialized. And the transmission line to do that had been seriously delayed for years. That is actually almost done as well. The concern broadly on all this stuff, is that the Trump administration, which does not like renewable power, especially offshore wind, he doesn't like onshore wind all that much either, but he has a little less control over it, because unless it's on federal land, offshore wind, because it is in federally controlled waters that he has a lot of control over.

He doesn't like solar much either. Solar, of course, also would not necessarily end up on federal land, but it has enjoyed some very, very robust energy tax credits, federal tax credits on the order of 30% which is a big tax credit for a number of years now, and that for certain systems, most residential purchase systems, that ends at the end of this year. That was another action by the Trump administration. It came in early July, and for commercial systems and lease systems, it has another year to go. Bottom line, you pile all these together, you've got an absolute target on offshore wind. You have a financial target on solar that can make it a lot more expensive. You have the prospect of having to deal with federal permitting on certain things. And if you and the Trump administration don't like it, they can slow that down or kill that, which is part of what they've done with other offshore wind. It's not the kind of perfect storm you want to see if you're, if you're the Department of Energy Environmental protection.

WSHU: Now, the Trump administration has been pushing clean coal. We got rid of all our coal-fired power stations in Connecticut. Is there any future there?

JES: First of all, let's just be clear, there is no such thing as clean coal. People need to understand that Donald Trump may use that terminology, but what he is loosely referring to is a coal plant that will capture the emissions from it and store them. It's a technology that has never been perfected. It is barely in use. It is not something that exists. New England has no more coal plants. The last one, which was in New Hampshire, closed recently, which was a year earlier than expected. Coal is worldwide and in the U.S. a dying industry at the moment. I mean, I can't speak for financial people, but would investors reinvest in coal plants? Hard to say. But if I were a betting person, I would bet not. He has issued permits to extend the use of coal plants in other parts of the country for longer periods. But will that happen in New England? No. I mean, they're basically shut down. It's not stuff that is due to shut down. Where New England has to worry about coal is the emissions coming from it, because we are located where we are located, we get all kinds of pollution from that, from greenhouse gases to, you know, standard pollutants that cause all kinds of health problems here.

WSHU: Now, energy prices aren't coming down. So what is the future? What are regulators and policymakers looking at right now?

JES: What is being looked at right now at the federal level? The feds, yes, they want to keep coal going. They are also doing more oil and gas leasing, which has either been eliminated or tamped down in some ways. Will that impact folks here in Connecticut? Potentially, natural gas plants could stay open longer than had been intended. The likelihood of building another natural gas plant is very expensive, and the materials for them have been in very short supply for years to come. We also don't know what tariffs are going to do to various materials. We don't know what is going to happen in terms of needed minerals for that kind of thing. So that's one bucket. A lot of folks look at the millstone plant, which has a lot of power. It's 2100 megawatts more or less together, can run 24/7, and it supplies about a little less than a third of the power along with the Seabrook nuclear power plant in New Hampshire. It supplies about a third of the power in New England. It's already extended its license.

Again, nuclear plants can run for quite a while. There's a lot of discussion about advanced nuclear plants and whatnot, and there's a lot of misconceptions and misinformation out there in terms of what is actually available in terms of that advanced nuclear, and the bottom line is, it's not available. In some cases, the technology doesn't fully exist yet, and it's many, it's, you know, you're talking 2030, at the earliest. And I will have more details on that in the future.

WSHU: Okay. But basically, can we say that there is a glimmer of a silver lining to the dark clouds for our energy future?

JES: Oh, there are a couple of yin and yangs to them. Look at one of the reasons everybody is scrambling for power; presumably, we're going to have all this AI. We're going to have all these data centers, not many of which have ever ended up in New England, for a lot of economic reasons. Land is expensive. There's not all that much space. And it's unclear whether it's going to pan out to the levels that some people think it will, and I've heard that from some, you know, pretty high-end economists who are a little skeptical, we're going to need that much power. Also, if you're pulling tax credits off things like electric vehicles, which are gone, that was going to be kind of a power suck. Will those tax credits being gone then diminish the demand for EVs so you won't need as much power as possible?

The flip side of that is, if people aren't building as much solar, then you are taking away that great hedge of not needing enough power. So it's hard to say. What people in New England and Connecticut don't always realize is that power demand in the region for 10-15 years has been flat, if not lower than it was expected. The independent system operator that runs the grid expects that in the next 10 years, it'll increase by about 11% but that was before all this happened. Will it continue to increase like that? Unclear. In a sense, the biggest issue here is that you have all kinds of entities preparing for future power needs. There are so many wrinkles and so many uncertainties and so many outright hand grenades being thrown into this thing. I keep asking people, well, how do you plan? And it's hard. These guys just don't totally know now how to plan for a future where the power plant they were expecting, just like Revolution Wind, might get stopped. And now, what do we do? It's very, very difficult for that future. We can say what's out there, you know, maybe more nuclear way down the road, you know, would someone build another gas plant? Unclear. Will people keep investing in solar because it will help their own personal electric rates? It's possible, but we don't know. So the trajectory we have been on, the odds of the region, because we are a regional grid staying on. That could be anybody's guess at this point.

WSHU: So, bottom line, it's much more difficult for policymakers to try and figure this out.

JES: Yes, if their goal is to keep energy rates low, boy, this is about the biggest wrinkle that could have been thrown at them.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e2db946/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5184x2722+0+292/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F92%2F3d%2Fb06c9f9b4098bc4fc749851247d9%2Fap23321628142358.jpg,N,,2025-10-27 16:23:06.015710

The stakes at this year’s COP30 climate conference couldn’t be higher.

Global temperatures are breaking records, extreme weather is hitting harder and more often, and food and energy systems are under severe strain. At the same time, political headwinds are growing stronger. In many countries, climate ambitions are colliding with concerns over competitiveness, cost of living and security. This risks slowing progress at the very moment when science warns the window for decisive action is closing.

This year’s UN climate conference in November will bring delegates from around the world together in Belém, Brazil to set goals for reducing the impacts of climate change. Ahead of the conference, POLITICO hosted a three-part live event series, presented by Bayer, held in Berlin, Germany; Brussels, Belgium; and Brasília, Brazil. These discussions convened leaders from politics, business and civil society to test new ideas, challenge assumptions and highlight pathways forward. With events in Europe and Latin America, the conversations captured the different regional forces shaping the debate: from Europe’s struggle to maintain momentum in the face of political and economic obstacles, to Brazil’s effort to harness its resources to create a more sustainable model of development.

What emerged was a clearer sense of the barriers and the possibilities: The transition to climate neutrality will require cooperation across borders, sectors and policies that are durable enough to withstand shifting political winds. It will also demand innovation in how food is produced, energy is generated and natural ecosystems are protected. As delegates head to COP30, the discussions offer timely context for what hangs in the balance. They point to the difficult choices that lie ahead, but also to the opportunities for building new coalitions capable of turning ambition into action.

Europe’s climate ambition under strain

Despite significant progress in recent years, Europe faces complex questions around maintaining momentum in reaching climate goals. The event, which convened in early September, revealed tensions playing out on the wider political stage, as EU member states look to balance climate ambition with economic realities — while seeking to set actionable new goals.

“The European Commission’s proposal for a 90 percent cut [in emissions from 1990 levels] by 2040 is not just something nice to have, it is essential,” said Jochen Flasbarth, state secretary at Germany’s Environment Ministry, at the event. Flasbarth will also be the lead negotiator for Germany at COP30. His concern reflects a competitive reality: If EU-wide targets are weakened, German companies — bound by strict domestic climate laws — could face higher costs than competitors in less ambitious European nations, potentially driving business elsewhere in the market.

This fracturing, a key topic at the Berlin to Belém event, came to the fore in late September, when the Commission was unable to agree on a firm reduction target for 2035. Instead of presenting a fully-fledged plan at the UN’s climate meeting in New York, EU ministers had to settle for proposing a target decrease range of 66.25 percent to 72.5 percent. Countries like Slovakia opposed the higher figure, while others, including Germany, considered the lower bound of the range unacceptably weak.

Business has a vital part to play

The discussion also unpacked how companies are navigating an increasingly fraught political landscape. Following last year’s U.S. election, there have been some boardrooms that are reassessing their climate commitments. Matthias Berninger, Bayer’s Executive Vice President and Head of Public Affairs, Sustainability, and Safety, said he’s seen four types of reactions. Some companies, he noted, are simply turning around in order to sail with the political winds. Others are giving up entirely. A third group is hitting the pause button. But, he says, there remains a substantial cohort of businesses — including Bayer — standing firm on climate goals despite the shifting tides that come with substantial headwinds.

This corporate determination matters more than ever. “Paris was possible because key industry players supported the climate agenda, and I think that is what is also necessary in Belém,” Berninger said. Other panelists seemed to agree that this is as much a business imperative as it is an environmental one: While the dismantling of ESG frameworks might tempt some enterprises to scale back, the smartest companies understand that weather volatility and supply chain disruptions affect bottom lines regardless of political rhetoric.

Genuine collaboration between sectors must, for this reason, be the way forward, panelists said. “The entire climate issue can only be addressed in a public-private effort,” argued Philipp Rösler, CEO of Consessor AG, a management consultancy, and former German Vice Chancellor. While acknowledging that business has to remain profitable, he stressed that sustainability should be integrated into core operating models, not treated as charity or public relations. This partnership approach — combining policy frameworks with private innovation — offers the only viable route to meaningful climate action at scale.

We have a totally different environment in comparison to [previous] COPs… Now it's time to stand together and to make it a success — because, if Germany and Europe [don't] take over leadership, no one else will do it.

Dr. Philipp Rösler

CEO of Consessor AG, former German Vice-Chancellor and Federal Minister

Brazil’s moment to lead

With COP30 on the horizon, panelists noted an increased urgency and importance of the conference and Brazil’s unique position to reshape global climate governance in an increasingly fractured world. The shifting landscape creates challenge and opportunity for the host nation, which brings credibility both as a victim of environmental degradation and as a potential solution provider — with its agricultural strength, significant forest cover and environmental investment, and future opportunities for large-scale land restoration.

“Let’s not lose the focus of this event; we need to get Belém to be a success,” urged Lisa Badum, Green Party member of the German Bundestag. She underscored Europe’s pivotal role in achieving meaningful progress by building coalitions with Latin America and climate vulnerable states — alliances that can push back against governments that may be trying to weaken decarbonization targets and other climate initiatives.

Panelists praised Brazil President Lula’s proposal for a financing facility for standing forests as potentially game-changing, addressing the grievance of nations that have preserved their forests while watching deforested countries access climate finance. The Tropical Forest Forever Facility would use a novel approach: Investing $125 billion in financial markets and directing returns — potentially $2.8 billion annually — to countries that successfully protect their rainforests. Unlike traditional climate funds that reward reforestation, this mechanism would compensate states for keeping forests intact. With Brazil pledging the first $1 billion and support from partner nations and private banks, the initiative seeks to establish a new model where conservation results in financial gain.

The disconnect between vision and budget

As part of the EU’s next long-term budget package, known as the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF), European Commissioners plan to merge the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) into an €865 billion fund alongside cohesion, migration and border policies. This change will significantly alter how farm support works across Europe. The EU says the goal of this new fund is to help close the gap between regions, while allowing more flexibility and efficiency to help member states reach wide-ranging goals. The Brussels panel revealed deep concerns about this restructuring, with Dacian Cioloș, former Prime Minister of Romania and Commissioner for Agriculture and Food, European Commission, delivering a stark assessment of what it means for farmers. “With the legislative proposals on the MFF package, including agriculture, this is the beginning of the end of a common agricultural policy,” he said.

The proposal shifts significant budgetary control to member states, which would design national plans with discretion over spending priorities. This would fragment what has been one of Europe’s most integrated policies, Cioloș argued. When different countries can set vastly different payment levels for the same farming activities, market distortions follow. A wheat farmer in Romania might receive far less support than one in France, despite operating in the same single market. “In agriculture, once you lose some farmers, they will not come back,” he said.

Cioloș called for maintaining common European rules while connecting agricultural policy with trade, environmental and energy objectives. He emphasized a need to transform direct payments into clearer incentives that reward environmental services and food security contributions — not social support, which undermines the policy’s legitimacy.

Climate and environmental ambition at risk

There were also concerns among the panel’s environmental advocates, who warned of degraded climate measures in a reformed CAP. Marco Contiero, Greenpeace’s EU Agriculture Policy Director, acknowledged some positive elements in the proposal such as better targeting of support and transition planning for farmers, but said that the numbers were worrying. Currently, 32 percent of CAP funding goes to environmental measures through eco-schemes and agri-environmental programs. Under the new structure, that could fall to one-fifth, or less, he said.

“The remaining 20 percent, more or less, will have to be divided between agri-environmental decisions, investment support, support for areas of natural constraints, knowledge and innovation spreading, et cetera,” Contiero explained. With so many mandatory measures competing for a shrinking pot, environmental ambitions could face severe constraints.

This comes at a moment of mounting climate costs: Between 2020 and 2023, Europe suffered more financial damage from extreme weather than in the entire previous decade, with annual losses averaging €44.5 billion.

On the one hand, farmers need stability. They need, to a certain extent, the assurance with regard to the business they're in, that it's remaining a viable, professional and profitable business going forward. On the other hand, farmers also need an incentivization scheme towards innovation. So how can we ensure that farmers are recognized and appreciated for driving sustainable agriculture?

Jens Hartmann

Head, Europe, Middle East and Africa, Crop Science Division, Bayer

The link between innovation and resilience

Industry representatives stressed that building agricultural resilience requires embracing innovation across the board. Jens Hartmann, Head of Europe, Middle East and Africa at Bayer’s Crop Science division, pointed to a troubling reality — no new conventional crop protection molecules have been registered in Europe for five years. “It’s the combination of innovation which ultimately drives resilience,” he argued, calling for new breeding techniques that can create heat, drought and pest-resistant crops.

Opening the event, Max Müller, Bayer’s Head of Global Public Affairs, framed the issue in broader terms. He warned that Europe risks falling behind if it continues to move too slowly in bringing new technologies to market at a time when farmers face mounting climate pressures. “With innovation, agriculture can move from being part of the problem to become part of the solution,” he said, pointing to advances in biotechnology and crop science that could boost sustainability and competitiveness.

But technology alone won’t solve Europe’s agricultural challenges. The panel agreed on the sector’s aging crisis: Young people aren’t entering farming due to income unpredictability and lack of respect for the profession. Hartmann linked this directly to recent farmer protests: “It was a lot about whether farmers are actually recognized as a very, very important and strong contributor to food security in Europe.”

The solution requires what Hartmann termed a “regenerative” approach — not just producing more on the same land, but rethinking entire crop cycles while ensuring farmers have access to new revenue streams like carbon farming, which rewards practices that capture and store atmospheric carbon in the ground.

Betting Big on the Future with Biofuels

Brasília

At the third event in Brasília, “Brazil's Biofuel Revolution,” officials and industry leaders outlined how a mix of policy, land use and technology could let the country scale renewable fuels without displacing agriculture.

On Brazil’s leading the way

On the biofuel bet that paid off

From competition to coexistence

The idea that biofuels threaten food security and undermine environmental goals has long shaped the global energy debate. Critics warn that crops grown for fuel can compete with food supplies, push up prices and drive land-use change. Brazil is chipping away at this narrative, audience members in Brasília learned, by expanding energy production without displacing food or forests. In doing so, COP30’s host nation is “teaching the world how to produce food while making a sustainable energy transition,” explained Francila Calica, Vice President of Agricultural Affairs and Sustainability, Bayer Crop Science Latin America.

Gabriel Delgado, the Inter-American Institute for Cooperation on Agriculture’s representative in Brazil, echoed the point, arguing that technological advancements and smarter land use are making the supposed trade-off between food and energy “obsolete in a very short time.” That shift, speakers said, is not the product of a single innovation but of a layered system designed to make food and energy production work in tandem. Sugarcane provides the backbone, supplying sugar, ethanol and surplus electricity; corn contributes a second stream by turning off-season harvests into biofuel; and macaúba — a native palm used as a biofuel feedstock — offers further expansion without claiming new land.

Policy and markets as enablers

Brazil’s biofuel strategy is being propelled as much by policy design as by agricultural innovation, with clear, consistent rules giving producers and investors the confidence to scale. Pedro Guerra, Chief of Staff to the Vice-President and Minister, Brazil's Ministry of Development, Industry, Trade and Services, highlighted the Future of Fuels law — a new framework that sets long-term biofuel blending trajectories and market signals — as an important example. “The first measure was to approve a bill and create predictability in terms of blending percentages. This was key for the development of the sector — not only in the biodiesel industry, but also in the ethanol sector,” he said.

That policy clarity is reinforced by increasing mandatory blend levels, which determine the share of biofuels that must be mixed into conventional fuels. Brazil currently blends around 14 percent biodiesel into its diesel pool, with plans to raise that to 20 percent by 2030. Ethanol production is expected to expand from just over 30 billion liters a year today to nearly 50 billion by 2034. RenovaBio, Brazil’s national decarbonization program, has underpinned that growth by issuing tradeable carbon credits to low-carbon fuel producers — avoiding more than 100 million tonnes of CO2 emissions since its launch in 2019.

Brazil has this large experience in biofuels, in ethanol, thanks to the oil shock in the seventies. It was a little bit traumatic, and the country learned to diversify its energy grid, thanks to this sort of experience. I think that the Europeans are having this harmful lesson nowadays. This is our first message, [...] the important thing is to diversify.

Pedro Guerra

Scaling through technology and inclusion

Speakers stressed that Brazil’s biofuel strategy is no longer just about proving a concept but about making it work at scale. Julia Cruz, Secretary of Green Economy, Decarbonization and Bioindustry, Brazil's Ministry of Development, Industry, Trade and Services, said new solutions are making it possible to rethink where and how fuels are produced. “We have technologies that can put a refinery at the size of a truck,” she said, pointing to smaller, modular biorefineries that can operate close to where feedstocks are grown.

Such flexibility, Cruz argued, could help broaden participation beyond major agribusinesses, creating new income streams for smaller producers while keeping supply chains local. It also complements Brazil’s large-scale land restoration plans, which aim to bring degraded areas back into productive use without threatening forests.

Panelists said these developments position Brazil to play a larger role internationally — not just as a major biofuel producer, but as a country exporting know-how and practical tools for others to follow. “This is one of the learnings that Brazil can show in this COP30, for the world,” said Calica. That message is expected to feature prominently at the climate conference, where Brazil will push for wider adoption of biofuels as part of the global energy transition.

The path to progress

Behind every promise to cut emissions is a harder question about balancing environmental goals with security, food and economic pressure. That tension ran throughout the discussions in all three cities, surfacing in debates over security, fiscal limits and the role of renewable fuels.

Countries are pursuing competing strategies, driven as much by domestic politics as by global climate ambition. Some rely on technology, others on market reform or energy diversification. Brazil’s approach adds another layer, a bid to prove that growth and decarbonization can be built on the same land.

When leaders meet in Belém, those fault lines will define the debate — and test whether nations can align their paths closely enough to make progress.

They illustrate a broader economic reality. Hydrogen as an energy source, as opposed to its use as an industrial feedstock, is increasingly failing under scrutiny. Fortescue’s projects had significant financial backing, government support, and appeared viable on paper. Yet the underlying economics simply could not withstand changing conditions.

The Arizona project was an 80 MW green hydrogen facility originally intended to establish Fortescue’s foothold in the American market. As I noted a year ago, building a green hydrogen project in an increasingly waterless desert was insane to begin with. The project’s cancellation followed shifts in US energy policy under the Trump administration, particularly the removal of certain hydrogen-related subsidies. This policy uncertainty quickly revealed the true economics of hydrogen production. With the incentives removed, the project’s already tenuous financial viability vanished, prompting Fortescue to write off approximately $150 million in pre-tax losses.

In Australia, Fortescue’s PEM50 hydrogen plant in Gladstone had already commenced partial operations. The project had secured approximately $40 million (about A$60 million) in government grants. Despite initial optimism, the facility proved costly and uncompetitive. As a result, the company decided not only to shut the facility down but is now evaluating whether the government grants will need to be repaid.

Clive Nickolay, CEO—Heavy Duty Gas Turbines & Aeroderivatives for GE Vernova, will sit down with POWER Senior Editor Darrell Proctor at the event on Wednesday, Oct. 29, at 4 p.m., for a discussion of the company’s technology and the future of gas-fired power generation.

The agreement announced October 27 includes existing permits, land control, and transmission interconnection. The companies said they expect the project, a two-phase, gas-fueled electric-generation facility with more than 1.2 GW of generation capacity,, will enter commercial operation as soon as 2029. Officials in a news release on Monday said the “project will utilize lower-carbon natural gas and recovered steam in a combined-cycle configuration to deliver flexible, more sustainable energy to the MISO [Midcontinent Independent System Operator] grid.”

Bechtel Serves as EPC Lead

Bechtel Infrastructure & Power Corp. will serve as the engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contractor for the facility.

“Developing these grid-scale generation projects typically takes years, and this agreement with GE Vernova marks a pivotal milestone in the execution of a project that began in 2021,” said Tom Spang, Advanced Power’s CEO. “Maple Creek will soon be ready to deliver reliable, dispatchable power to one of the fastest-growing load centers in the country.

North American solar PPA prices up 4% in Q3 amid ‘policy headwinds’

PV-Tech – October 15

Market-averaged solar PPA prices hit $59.77/MWh in the third quarter of this year, according to LevelTen Energy. The average price of a solar power purchase agreement (PPA) signed in North America increased 4% between the second and third quarters of this year, a change that is “unsurprising” considering the “policy headwinds” facing U.S. solar at present. The report notes that market-averaged prices across all three profiled project types—wind, blended, and solar—saw prices increase quarter-on-quarter. Each of these figures is the highest since at least the third quarter of 2023.

Combined, they provided 9.5% of the nation’s electrical output during August, up from 7.6% one year ago.

The SUN DAY Campaign reviewed the EIA data and found that solar-generated electricity year-to-date (YTD) easily surpassed — by over 58% — the output of the nation’s hydropower plants (5.6% of total generation). In August alone, solar-generated electricity more than doubled the output of the nation’s hydropower plants. In fact, in both August and YTD, solar produced more electricity than hydropower, biomass and geothermal combined.

Moreover, for the second consecutive month, utility-scale solar generated more electricity than the nation’s wind farms — by 4% in July and by 15% in August. Including small-scale systems, solar has out-produced wind four months in a row and by almost 50% during August.

During the first eight months of 2025, electrical generation by wind and all solar provided almost one-fifth (19.1%) of the U.S. total, up from 17.2% during the first two-thirds of 2024. The combination of wind and solar provided 16.2% more electricity than did coal during the first eight months of this year, and 11.7% more than the nation’s nuclear power plants. In fact, as solar and wind expanded, nuclear-generated electricity dropped by 0.7%.

The mix of all renewables produced 9% more electricity in January-August than they did a year ago and provided (26.1%) of total U.S. electricity production compared to 24.5% twelve months earlier. Renewables’ share of electrical generation is now second to only that of natural gas whose electrical output actually dropped by almost 4.1% during the first eight months of 2025.

Strong growth was also experienced by battery storage which grew by 63.9% during the past year and added 13,377.5 MW of new capacity. In the course of the past year, battery storage actually surpassed pumped hydro storage (PHS) — in October 2024 — and now accounts for 50% more storage capacity than PHS. EIA also notes that planned battery capacity additions during the next year total 20,179.8 MW.

On the other hand, natural gas capacity increased by only 3,337.7 MW and nuclear power added a mere 46.0 MW. Meanwhile, coal capacity plummeted by 4,185.1 MW and petroleum-based capacity fell by an additional 658.7 MW.

Thus, during the past year, renewable energy capacity, including battery storage and small-scale solar, ballooned by 55,419.6 MW while that of all fossil fuels and nuclear power combined actually declined by 1,486.3 MW.

“The Trump Administration and its Republican supporters in Congress may slow renewable energy growth a bit,” noted the SUN DAY Campaign’s executive director Ken Bossong. “However, EIA’s data reinforce the conclusion that the transition to solar, wind, other renewables and storage continues, is accelerating, and has become inevitable.”

EV sales freefall by around 43% as the $7,500 federal tax credit dries up

If you purchased a new EV earlier this year, you likely qualified for a hefty federal tax credit. As of the end of September, the government stopped offering a $7,500 tax credit for qualifying electric cars, trucks, and SUVs.

The credit significantly deferred the cost of entry for EV adopters, making a battery electric vehicle like the Nissan LEAF or Tesla Model Y much more affordable for new buyers. All in all, American buyers saved over three billion dollars using the tax credits during its 17-year run.

The incipient end of the tax credit in September did, however, boost EV sales in September. According to J.D. Power, “The expiration of federal EV credits on Sept. 30 caused EV shoppers to pull ahead their purchases, driving a significant increase in EV sales and inflating the overall industry sales pace,” said Thomas King at J.D. Power. “In September, EVs accounted for 12.9% of new-vehicle retail sales, the highest ever, and well above the 8.5% recorded a year earlier.”

But now the federal tax credit is no more, and American electric vehicle sales are feeling the squeeze. Projections put EV sales down 43% in October, one of the largest-ever year-over-year declines.

Analysts, however, believe that the impact could have been worse. Despite the sharp deterioration in EV sales, the decline could have been worse,” King said in a press release. “Actions by multiple manufacturers to reduce EV prices and increase discounts to offset the loss of the federal credit are helping to maintain EV affordability, thereby preventing an even larger decline in EV sales.”",https://www.motorbiscuit.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Nissan-Ariya-EVs-jetcityimage-via-iStock.jpg?w=1200,N,,2025-10-27 14:19:07.561655

""It got a $250 million grant to deliver solar and battery storage to nearly 30,000 households in Texas.""
Fletcher co-led 100 House Democrats in sending a letter to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin demanding he restore the program and reinstate the grant funding.
""This letter is responding to something even bigger than the Solar for All program,” Fletcher said.","Congressional Democrats are pressing the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to restore funding to a program expanding the deployment of solar energy for working families. The move follows Harris County's lawsuit against President Donald Trump’s administration to restore the program.

The EPA announced on Aug. 7 that it would terminate the Solar for All program and take back $7 billion in funds from grant recipients, saying the Trump administration's rescission package required it to do so. Houston Congresswoman Lizzie Fletcher played a key role in passing the program into law three years ago.

""This is a huge, important renewable energy program, and here in Texas, Harris County led a statewide coalition that won one of the five largest awards of any group in the country,"" Fletcher said. ""It got a $250 million grant to deliver solar and battery storage to nearly 30,000 households in Texas.""

Fletcher stressed that the program was designed to create thousands of well-paying jobs and to boost American manufacturing, in addition to making the electrical grid more reliable.

""All of that was happening here in Texas, in Houston, in Port Arthur, and in Waco,” she said. “Training programs were already underway to certify Texans in solar installation and energy efficiency. So, we’re talking about benefits for consumers, benefits for workers, and benefits for our environment and our economy.""

Fletcher co-led 100 House Democrats in sending a letter to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin demanding he restore the program and reinstate the grant funding. Fletcher said Zeldin's office has yet to respond.

""This letter is responding to something even bigger than the Solar for All program,” Fletcher said. “It’s about responding to the Trump administration’s continued efforts to consolidate power and overrule the other branches of government, and that would be Congress and the courts. What we see here is yet another example of the administration ignoring or rejecting the law that Congress has passed and programs that Congress has put into place for no reason or for reasons that they just don't agree with it.”

Invest in clean energy: Better regulations and stronger market confidence are key to unlocking renewable energy, storage capacity and energy efficiency.","Now comes the harder part: turning this political choice into real progress. The new government must strengthen the rule of law, push forward with reforms, and build the institutional capacity needed to make EU membership a reality.

Among the challenges ahead, two stand out – energy and the environment. Moldova has benefited from strong European support. The European Commission’s Growth Plan for Moldova, worth more than EUR 1.9 billion, has already been approved. Yet, the biggest obstacle is not money, but the country’s ability to deliver reforms and put policies into action.

A recent National Green Transition Assessment Report , launched by SEI in June, offers a roadmap for Moldova’s green transition. The report reviews progress across climate action, energy, buildings, industry, pollution, agriculture, transport and biodiversity. It highlights real achievements but also major gaps that must be closed.

Moldova has set an ambitious goal: to cut emissions by more than 70% by 2030 – exceeding the EU average. Yet serious challenges remain with green transition, governance and financing. Implementation often lags behind commitments, due to the already limited administrative capacity being pushed to their limits with the gigantic tasks related to EU accession.

This matters because Moldova is already feeling the effects of a changing climate. The country is highly exposed to droughts, floods and other extreme weather. A joint SEI and ACT Global public perception study found that 73% of Moldovans say climate change affects them or people close to them, 85% report health impacts, and more than half face economic hardship linked to climate-related issues. These disasters already cost the country about 1.3% of GDP each year.

Our assessment identifies areas where the new government must act fastest:

Accelerate digital and green transformation: Expanding digital services, creating decarbonization plans, and scaling up green technologies are essential for innovation, exports and green jobs. These steps can also improve living standards and open EU markets.

Improve adaptation readiness: Moldova needs stronger adaptation measures – public and private – to reduce damage from climate change, which hits vulnerable groups hardest.

Unlock green capital: Moldova will need over EUR 30 billion in investment to reach net zero. Closing this gap means attracting new climate finance and more private investors.

Empower local leadership and green finance: Municipalities need more tools, better capacity, and domestic green finance to lead climate action beyond reliance on international aid.

Invest in clean energy: Better regulations and stronger market confidence are key to unlocking renewable energy, storage capacity and energy efficiency. Workforce and infrastructure gaps must also be addressed.

Promote sustainable agriculture: Export-oriented agricultural reforms can make Moldovan products more competitive while protecting the environment and supporting EU market access.

Protect nature and biodiversity: Moldova needs urgent afforestation and updated environmental policies to ensure sustainable land management and meet EU biodiversity standards.

Upgrade waste and water solutions: Modern wastewater treatment and circular economy practices are vital for public health and pollution control.

Modernize transport: Shifting from a road-centric system to smarter, cleaner public transport will cut emissions and improve access to mobility.

Moldova has made its political choice for Europe. Now it must prove that choice through action. The elections showed how crucial European support has been – and continued backing will be vital. The EU, its member states, and the international community can help Moldova succeed through technical assistance, mobilization of green finance, knowledge sharing, and political partnership.

Helping Moldova carry out these reforms is not just about one country’s future – it is an investment in stability, energy security and resilience at Europe’s eastern frontier. With sustained support, Moldova can turn its European vision into lasting prosperity.",https://www.sei.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/gettyimages-2237548126-2-1488x708.webp?modtime=1761584824,N,,2025-10-27 16:23:14.984195

“ When the government is back to work, we'll pick up the ball with the EPA,” said Burns.","Powell is working with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to revitalize Park County’s main streets and build a big-picture strategy to boost outdoor recreation in the area. But the project is currently on pause because of the government shutdown.

The Powell Economic Partnership (PEP) is the first organization in the state to be part of the EPA’s Recreation Economy for Rural Communities planning assistance program, which launched in 2019. Communities get support from federal experts on a project to help enhance local economies and get people outside. PEP was one of 25 to be selected out of a pool of about 200 this year.

“ It's very much like when you have any sort of consultant come in who is planning something for the community,” said PEP Executive Director Rebekah Burns. “It's a very similar process to the land use plan or the county regulations. This one is just focusing on economic development and revitalizing downtowns using the outdoor recreation economy.”

Burns said she’s had her eye on the grant for a number of years, and that building a network of trails and pathways between towns was a big part of its application pitch.

“ We really wanted it to be a countywide effort that would benefit all of the counties downtown – the city of Meeteetsee, the city of Powell, and the City of Cody – and really connect our communities,” she said.

Instead of funding, the EPA program brings expertise. Consultants work with a local steering committee and hold a public meeting to source input from the broader community.

But getting that federal feedback isn’t happening right now because of the nationwide federal government shutdown. Burns said she was notified that the folks the group had started to work with are currently furloughed.

“That's good news as far as I'm concerned,” she said. “We have a status update and know that it's just a furlough. It's not a firing or something like that, which would be way more devastating to a project like this.”

PEP started in 2011 and took over the town’s Chamber of Commerce and Visitor Center a handful of years later. The organization has been focusing on developing the outdoor economy since 2019, with a goal of boosting frontcountry recreation to support the growth of associated businesses. But getting the infrastructure in place is no small feat.

“ [Building those assets] takes a lot of time and concerted effort, because there's so many players and stakeholders at the table when you're talking about land managers,” said Burns. “Often, around Powell or really anywhere in Park County, it's not uncommon to have three or four land managers potentially needing to collaborate on one project. And that doesn’t even include private landowners.”

Burns added that she hopes people come to community conversations about the topic with “an open mindset and a little bit of wonder” about what it could look like to connect the communities of Meeteetse, Powell and Cody, and what that would actually look like on the ground.

Despite the ongoing shutdown, PEP is continuing to work on a project to build 11 miles of trail from Garland to Ralston, nestled between a railroad track and a canal. It’s currently collaborating with two organizations to move that planning process along. But when it comes to figuring out a bigger-picture strategy for outdoor recreation in Park County?

The decline in October sales is largely attributed to the end of the $7,500 EV tax credits that expired at the end of September.
""The EV sales story will really change going forward from here,"" noted Chesbrough.
""Sales of EVs and PHEVs are expected to collapse in October as tax credits expire.
Cox Automotive maintains its full-year sales forecast between 15.8 and 16.4 million vehicles, with 16.1 million as the baseline projection.","Investing.com -- New vehicle sales in October are forecast to slow from the strong pace seen in the third quarter, with electric vehicle (EV) and plug-in hybrid vehicle (PHEV) sales expected to drop significantly following the expiration of tax credits.

According to Cox Automotive, the seasonally adjusted annual rate (SAAR) for October is projected to reach 15.7 million vehicles, down from 16.1 million last year and 16.4 million in September. Sales volume is expected to hit 1.30 million units, representing a decrease of more than 3% compared to October 2024, though this marks a 2.7% increase from September.

""The new-vehicle sales pace was surprisingly strong this summer despite ongoing tariff uncertainty,"" said Charlie Chesbrough, senior economist at Cox Automotive. ""However, as more tariffed products replace non-tariffed inventory, prices are tracking higher, which should lead to slower sales through the remainder of the year.""

The decline in October sales is largely attributed to the end of the $7,500 EV tax credits that expired at the end of September. These incentives had previously driven EV sales to record levels in the third quarter of 2025, when sales reached 438,487 units - a 40.7% increase from the previous quarter and 29.6% higher than the same period last year.

""The EV sales story will really change going forward from here,"" noted Chesbrough. ""Sales of EVs and PHEVs are expected to collapse in October as tax credits expire. In addition, market conditions for other vehicles are expected to become more challenging in future months as prices increase.""

Cox Automotive maintains its full-year sales forecast between 15.8 and 16.4 million vehicles, with 16.1 million as the baseline projection. The company has adjusted its forecast for both fleet and new retail sales higher following strong third-quarter performance, while lowering its lease penetration forecast from 25% to 24% due to the anticipated decline in EV leasing during the fourth quarter.

Unlike traditional exchanges, which offer lower tiers for smaller issuers, TXSE will operate as a single-tier exchange and require a confidential pre-application review before formal listing, allowing companies to assess readiness without public disclosure – available at no cost.4 TXSE has also collaborated with state leaders to create a pro-business environment, aimed at reducing regulatory friction and enhancing predictability for issuers.5

Why This Matters for Canadian Issuers

1. Cost Efficiency Compared to Other Exchanges

TXSE has committed to a competitive fee structure for going and staying public, coupled with a streamlined listing process.6

2. Dual-Listing Opportunities

Canadian issuers can maintain their TSX or TSXV listing while adding TXSE to broaden their investor base and access U.S. capital markets.

3. Sector Alignment

TXSE's Texas base positions it as a natural fit for energy, infrastructure, and industrial issuers, sectors where Canadian companies excel.

4. Issuer-Friendly Corporate Laws

Texas has adopted provisions designed to create the nation's ""most pro-business environment.""7 These reforms reduce litigation risk, limit shareholder activism, strengthen director protections, streamline governance, and provide tax clarity. A proposed constitutional amendment would also ban financial transaction taxes, creating a predictable, low-cost environment for public companies and market infrastructure.8

Initial Listing Standards

A. Domestic Issuers

Domestic issuers may qualify under one of two quantitative tests:9

1. Earnings Test

$10-12M in aggregate pre-tax earnings over three years, with minimum thresholds in recent years; or

2. Global Market Capitalization Test

Minimum $200M market value, with a bid price of $4.00 per share for 90 consecutive trading days.

Additional requirements include four Market Makers (unless the company meets certain income, equity, and market value requirements),10 and distribution criteria of 400 round-lot shareholders, 1.1M publicly held shares, and $40M public float.11 These thresholds broadly align with NYSE and Nasdaq's upper tiers, but notably exceed Nasdaq's lower-tier Capital Market.12

B. Quantitative Standards for Foreign Private Issuers (FPIs)

FPIs may qualify under the above domestic criteria, or TXSE's alternative listing standards,13 which mirror NYSE requirements for FPIs.14 Under the alternative standard, FPIs must maintain a broad, liquid market in their home country,15 and satisfy one of the following financial tests:16

1. Earnings Test

$100M aggregate pre-tax earnings over three years, with a minimum of $25M in each of the two most recent years.

2. Valuation / Revenue Test

Option 1: $500M in global market capitalization, $100M revenue in the most recent 12-month period, and $100M aggregate cash flow over three years, or

Option 2: $750M in global market capitalization with $75M revenue in the most recent year.

3. Affiliated Company Test

$500M global market cap with minimum 12-month operating history, and the parent or affiliate must be in good standing and retain control or be under common control of the entity.

In addition, FPIs must have four Market Makers (unless the company meets certain income, equity, and market value requirements),17 and meet the distribution criteria of: 5,000 round-lot shareholders, 2.5M publicly held shares, and market value of $100M ($60M for companies under the Affiliated Company Test).18

Key Considerations for Canadian Issuers

TXSE offers Canadian companies an alternative to traditional U.S. exchanges, but its listing standards are rigorous. As a single-tier exchange, TXSE's quantitative thresholds align with the upper tier of other U.S. exchanges and, unlike NYSE or Nasdaq, does not offer lower tiers for smaller issuers. Eligibility will depend on meeting these criteria, so early-stage issuers may need to scale before qualifying.

Cross-border compliance is another key consideration; companies must adhere to U.S. federal securities laws and Canadian regulations, including disclosure obligations under the Multi-Jurisdictional Disclosure System (MJDS) where applicable. With TXSE expected to launch in late 2026, early engagement through the confidential pre-application process is recommended.

Next Steps

TXSE combines familiar financial tests and governance provisions while introducing unique elements like mandatory pre-application review and high, single-tier quantitative thresholds. Issuers should start by reviewing size, governance structure, and reporting capabilities against TXSE's standards, and compare scenarios such as dual-listing on TXSE versus NYSE, Nasdaq or over-the-counter alternatives. Early engagement can help position companies ahead of the exchange's launch.

An increase in auto sales

After two straight quarters of big declines in its core auto business, Tesla's auto revenue grew in Q3. This was likely because of U.S. customers rushing to buy EVs before the $7,500 federal EV tax credit expired at the end of September.

After a 13% drop in deliveries in both the first and second quarters, Tesla's deliveries rose by 7% in Q3. Model 3 and Model Y deliveries increased by 9%, while other models plunged by 30%.

Tesla's auto revenue rose by 6% to $21.2 billion in the quarter. However, within its auto revenue, its regulatory credits, which are pure gross margin, dropped by 44% to $417 million. This led to its profitability metrics falling despite the increase in auto sales.

Overall, Tesla's revenue climbed 12% to $28.1 billion. Its energy generation and storage revenue soared 44% to $3.4 billion, while its service revenue jumped 25% to nearly $3.5 billion. Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) plunged 31% to $0.50, missing the analyst consensus of $0.54, as compiled by LSEG. Its adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), meanwhile, fell by 9% to $4.2 billion.

Tesla did, however, see a nice increase in free cash flow, as it reduced its capital expenditures (capex) in the quarter. Its operating cash flow was flattish at $6.2 billion, while its free cash flow climbed by 46% to $4 billion.

Near-term uncertainty, but big promise for the future

While Tesla noted it will be facing near-term uncertainty, it once again made big promises for the future. Musk was upbeat about the company soon achieving unsupervised self-driving (FSD) capabilities. He said that with just a software update, he could turn millions of cars into full self-driving cars. However, it is notable that the company subtly changed the language in its shareholder letter, saying that ""Every Tesla vehicle delivered today is designed for autonomy."" It has also recently changed the definition of FSD.

Given his confidence, Musk said that he would ramp up vehicle production, and that Tesla could be able to produce 3 million vehicles a year within the next two years. This will be to support its Cybercab ambitions, as well as the increase in demand it expects it would see from offering unsupervised FSD technology with its cars, which would allow people to do things like text and watch videos instead of having to focus on the road.

Musk was also upbeat about its Optimus robot, saying Tesla plans to unveil Optimus V3 early next year and begin production toward the end of 2026. He stated that the company is planning to produce a million Optimus robots annually in the future, even though manufacturing presents some difficulties.

Should investors buy or avoid the stock?

Tesla's stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of over 188 based on 2026 analyst estimates, while its profitable auto peers -- like Ford Motor Company, General Motors, and Stellantis -- typically trade at multiples of 10 or less. Even luxury automaker Ferrari trades at just 33 times 2026 EPS estimates.

At this point, most of Tesla's stock value comes down to whether Musk can deliver on FSD and his Optimus robots. Without FSD, its core auto business is likely to struggle in the near term with the end of federal tax credits and high tariffs, along with rising competition in the EV space. Notably, Musk has expressed his confidence in FSD for the past six years with little progress, and its supervised robotaxi pilot in Austin has run into issues, so you can decide for yourself whether to share his enthusiasm.

For me, Tesla is a stock to avoid at the moment.",https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/839561/gettyimages-1348349243.jpg,N,,2025-10-27 16:23:09.999671

The Revolution shutdown, along with the tax credit eliminations, unpredictability of Trump energy policies and mandates come just as the ISO was beginning its next 10-year energy forecast.","Connecticut, along with the rest of New England, has long recognized that its energy future lies in cleaning up the electricity sources in its power grid.

And since the 1990s, with the start of the effort to close the “sooty six” coal and oil plants, cleaning up the air for health and climate reasons has figured equally with saving money by using free renewable sources like sun and wind.

The Trump administration has now made that a lot harder, if not impossible, to do, leaving Connecticut and the entire region with the question: Now what?

Since his first day in office, Trump has set about eliminating future development of onshore and offshore wind on federal property, which effectively means all offshore wind, a form of renewable power Trump openly despises. So far, his administration has issued stop-work orders for two northeast offshore wind installations already under construction, including one for Connecticut. Each resumed construction after about a month, losing millions of dollars in the process.

Trump has also succeeded getting a law on the books to end the widely popular and effective federal tax credits for wind, solar and energy efficiency projects. The administration also threw its weight behind keeping old and dirty coal plants operating longer than previously planned, as well as subsidizing more coal mining. And it is ramping up oil and gas drilling, all in the name of an “energy emergency” that Trump claims exists, even though the country is the largest producer of oil and gas in the world.

“Singling out and disfavoring renewable resources while many other resources continue to enjoy favorable tax treatment, including fossil resources — this is not leveling the playing field. This is definitely putting a finger on the scale to disadvantage clean renewable energy resources,” said Katie Dykes, commissioner of Connecticut’s Department of Energy and Environmental Protection. She called the end of the tax credit “really challenging,” noting the state had a pipeline of projects it had hoped to bring forward, and warned that power prices would likely increase.

“We are doing what we can within our state jurisdictional programs to try to fill in some of the gaps. Obviously, we can’t fill all the gaps,” Dykes said. The state is urging residents, businesses, governmental entities and energy developers to take advantage of the tax credits before many of them disappear at the end of the year. To that end, DEEP issued an expedited request for proposals for solar and onshore wind. Proposals were due Oct. 10. Energy efficiency, especially useful to lower income and environmental justice communities, may feel the impact most acutely.

But it is offshore wind and the massive amount of carbon-free power it can generate, that Connecticut, and really the entire Northeast, had been counting on.

DEEP must sort through all of this uncertainty as it devises its new Integrated Resource Plan, a 10-year look ahead at energy needs and how to meet them, in keeping with the energy and climate policies the state has in place.

But in addition to the federal government’s energy policies, DEEP now has to reckon with the administration’s tariffs, policies on imported critical minerals, supply chain concerns and environmental about-faces. And it risks the potential for retribution if the state defies Trump’s wishes on anything, not just climate policy.

“We are undertaking planning efforts that are intended to try to assess as best we can what some of the different future scenarios will look like in terms of electricity needs, but also climate planning, and to do our best to identify the types of investments that might make sense, on what time horizon, given the change in the federal landscape, but also demand growth and reliability needs and so on,” Dykes said.

Dan Dolan is also thinking about what to do now. He’s president of the New England Power Generators Association, a trade organization that represents about 95% of the generating capacity in the region.

“Where we stand right now is this muddled middle period,” he said.

Demand isn’t rising quite as fast as anticipated due to the impacts of solar and energy efficiency on the grid. But there’s also uncertainty about whether that trend will continue without tax credits and whether planned large power source additions will come online on time or at all.

“In terms of new supply sources, I am not seeing meaningful, large-scale new developments happening anytime soon in the region,” Dolan said. “If demand continues to be more muted in its growth, we can handle that.“

But he said if demand does go up significantly, despite individual state commitments to transition from fossil fuel power sources to clean and renewable ones, the region might have to look at keeping older, dirtier power sources operating for longer than planned, and that might mean spending more than a little money to upgrade them.

“I’m seeing a lot of investors watching but staying on the sidelines for the moment,” Dolan said.

Rep. Jonathan Steinberg, D-Westport, is co-chair of the legislature’s Energy and Technology Committee. He has been a member of the committee since entering the legislature in 2011, so he has seen the twists, turns and growing pains as the state endeavored to create and implement its first short- and long-term strategies toward renewable energy while addressing climate change, health of citizens and high energy rates.

“We had, in our procurement planning and our capacity analysis, obviously — in conjunction with (grid operator) ISO-New England — counted on the availability of renewable energy sources to meet our needs,” he said. With the federal government now undermining those supply plans, “That is now a crisis that might have been 10 years away. It is now moving closer and closer to being an actual, impending crisis.

“We’re really low on options, but renewables were a critical part of that picture going forward.”

After many years of delay, a transmission line for hydropower from Canada — the Northeast Clean Energy Connect, NECEC — is months from completion. The power is being purchased by Massachusetts, but it provides a relief valve for the entire New England grid. Breath-holding is underway that the Trump administration will not sabotage it, given the administration’s fraught relationship with Canada as well as the blue-state northeast.

If that and the two offshore wind projects under construction off New England are finished, Dykes said, it will add about 13% of supply.

But any offshore wind beyond that, including projects approved by the Biden administration? ‘Unlikely’ would be a generous assessment of its future.

How dead is offshore wind?

Offshore wind was the big prize. At the end of the Biden administration, 11 projects had been approved nationally that would have provided the power equivalent of nearly 10 Millstone power stations and gotten the U.S. about two-thirds of the way to the Biden goal of 30 gigawatts of offshore wind by 2030.

Today, five are under construction. A sixth, South Fork Wind off the eastern tip of Long Island, is completed and began operating about a year ago. The remaining five have been stopped either at early stages or through efforts by the Trump administration to review or outright rescind already-issued federal permits. The administration ended all new lease-area designations and permits.

Of the two under construction that faced stop-work orders, one is Revolution Wind, a joint Connecticut and Rhode Island project that is already 80% complete. While it and the other project — New York’s Empire Wind — have restarted, it’s unclear what might happen to the other three. In the case of Revolution, a legal dispute is still underway.

“I think there’s no question that East Coast states, particularly from the mid-Atlantic up, have to continue to fight for offshore wind,” said Elizabeth Klein, who served as the final Biden administration director of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, BOEM, the entity within the Interior Department responsible for offshore wind.

“There’s no question that what the current administration is doing is damaging to the industry and causing a great deal of harm,” she said. “The looming question is whether or not these companies who are involved will be able to essentially wait it out and invest their time and resources in parts of developing offshore wind that aren’t directly about getting permits and approvals to move forward with new projects.”

Ørsted, the company developing Revolution Wind and other projects, declined to comment on the situation. Avangrid, the company developing Vineyard Wind 1, the only other New England project under construction, did not respond to inquiries.

Klein said the Trump administration claim that it was concerned about national security issues with Revolution Wind is “specious.” She said national security is reviewed in conjunction with several departments throughout every stage of the offshore wind process, beginning with the basic identification of offshore areas that might be suitable for leasing.

“All of those things are considered throughout the process, starting with where these sales first take place,” she said. “This is arbitrary and capricious decision-making. There’s no evidence that there’s something new or unusual or that had not been considered.”

Trump himself has circulated a host of falsehoods about offshore wind — that it causes cancer and kills an outsized number of birds and whales, and that it only runs some of the time. Offshore wind is a technology that is a quarter-of-a-century old, during which time it has operated successfully in Europe. Onshore wind is far older.

A one-year assessment of South Fork Wind by its developer, Ørsted, showed the turbines operated every month of the year. The data, which came from U.S. government’s Energy Information Administration, EIA, showed some of South Fork’s highest outputs were during the winter, when the power is needed most, due to natural gas being used for heating as well electricity. The wind power can prevent electricity price spikes.

The company also found the turbine foundations were already operating as artificial reefs that supported marine life.

The waters off the northeast U.S. are considered among the country’s best for offshore wind, given the area’s wind speeds and other factors. And since the region doesn’t have any fossil fuel resources, even with steep up-front costs, offshore wind is likely to quickly become cost effective, given the fuel is free.

A recent analysis by Politico of EIA data showed that adding wind and solar to the electricity mix tended to lower the cost of electricity, not increase it, as the Trump administration claims. The Politico analysis said: “Among the 22 states that drew higher-than-average shares of their power from wind and solar, 17 had below-average electricity prices in June, according to EIA data.”

“Undermining viable sources of energy is inconsistent with the objective of addressing an energy ‘emergency’ and will instead exacerbate energy supply challenges in the Northeast,” said Peter Shattuck, a director at Power Advisory LLC., a joint Canada/U.S.-based energy consultant. Shattuck also is an energy and grid expert with long experience in New England.

He said that, in something of a tarnished silver lining, the Trump blockage will give long-term projects such as transmission extra time to plan. But trying to strategize through all the Trump executive orders, other policy changes and legal battles is bound to make projects more expensive.

“It will likely raise the risk profile and risk premiums that are included in projects,” he said.

“The actions from the federal administration against offshore winds have been targeted and very calculated. In our view, it’s holding back a huge source of power that is so desperately needed,” said Stephanie Francoeur, senior vice president of communications and external affairs for the educational nonprofit Oceantic, which supports marine renewable energy world-wide including offshore wind.

“The administration talks about an all-of-the-above energy strategy and unleashing American energy dominance. We advocate that offshore wind is a critical component to that strategy.” She said energy needs to be depoliticized so the market, not the government, can pick the winners and losers.

“They’re looking to take apart an entire industry that could support energy demand in the U.S., address national security issues actually, because there is nothing better from a national security perspective on energy supply than generating it yourself at home, here in the U.S.,” Klein said.

Those concerns are not lost on the region’s grid operator, ISO-New England, which released an uncharacteristically blunt warning a couple of days after work stopped on Revolution Wind.

“The ISO is expecting this project to come online and it is included in our analyses of near-term and future grid reliability. Delaying the project will increase risks to reliability,” the statement read. “Unpredictable risks and threats to resources —regardless of technology — that have made significant capital investments, secured necessary permits, and are close to completion will stifle future investments, increase costs to consumers, and undermine the power grid’s reliability and the region’s economy now and in the future,” it continued.

The Revolution shutdown, along with the tax credit eliminations, unpredictability of Trump energy policies and mandates come just as the ISO was beginning its next 10-year energy forecast. The ISO has already said it expects demand to begin to increase after years of flat or even declining energy needs.

“I think in the short term we still expect to be OK, but it’s kind of in that longer-term and the uncertainty that’s brought into this that’s challenging from a grid planning standpoint,” said ISO spokesman Matt Kakley.

The ISO’s most recent estimates are that region’s annual electricity consumption will increase by about 11% over the next decade. On one hand, the removal of tax credits for electric vehicles and heat pumps could shrink that demand. On the other, their removal for solar systems and energy efficiency could increase it.

In addition to the offshore wind and the NECEC transmission line, the ISO is also expecting the six New England states to move ahead with their first joint development of transmission that, after more than a decade of delay, would finally get onshore wind from northern Maine onto the southern part of the New England grid.

Kakley said six proposals from four different developers were submitted by the Sept. 30 deadline.

Now there is the concern that the need for any federal signoffs could mean further delay, or worse.

Kakley said the ISO always deals with uncertainty when predicting power needs in the face of the complexities of long-term power and transmission projects. “This is a different sort of uncertainty than what we’ve seen,” he said. “We’re really looking at what we can do to enhance our ability to forecast and synthesize all the different factors that are coming in – adding resources, taking resources out, and seeing what that does to the region’s risk profile.”

What about solar?

Solar’s outlook is a little squishier than offshore wind’s. Yes, the coveted 30% tax credits are slated to disappear — for purchased residential systems at the end of this year and in another year for leased and commercial ones.

But costs for solar have come down dramatically over time, making it one of the cheapest forms of power to purchase. It’s also the fastest to install. So it’s possible residential consumers and commercial investors will still consider it a cost effective option.

Another unknown factor is the effect of tariffs and other restrictions on imported components on that low price and availability, as well as to storage systems that can be paired with it.

New England has never been a hotbed for huge commercial installations the way the desert southwest and other parts of the country, with large sunny expanses, can be. But rooftop solar for homeowners and on municipal and commercial buildings still has huge potential in the region and can be extremely useful to grid reliability.

It is already more useful than the ISO ever imagined it would be. The ISO says it has prevented brownouts and worse on hot summer days with air conditioning cranked up around the region. It has sent spot market prices into negative territory, especially on sunny days when neither heat nor air conditioning is needed.

“I think there’s capital out there that’s willing to invest,” said DEEP Commissioner Dykes. “I think the question is, what’s the price of solar without federal support, and with tariffs, all these other things coming into play? How does that affect the cost benefit for investment, and how much can we bring those costs down?”

Dykes has a few ideas. One is to look into swapping out solar panels in older systems for new, more efficient panels as a means to increase power output. Another is to use — in her words — already disturbed sites, such as the site of a retired oil-fired generator, for grid-scale storage for excess solar power. Using a preexisting power site would mean there’s already connections to the distribution system.

The biggest open question for Connecticut is what might change in state policy to help make up for the lost tax credit. The Public Utilities Regulatory Authority will be weighing that as part of its reconsideration of the rules for the solar program it established. That reconsideration was already planned and underway, with recommendations due in March.

Another policy aspect involves what the state might do legislatively. Unlike most of its neighbors, Connecticut has kept caps on the amount of solar allowed, only loosening some of them in the last few years.

It’s also an open question whether state money would be authorized to make up some of the tax credit shortfall, or whether the state might do as Canada already does and establish an infrastructure bank to leverage private and public money into the financing pipeline, or create a Transmission Infrastructure Accelerator like California recently enacted to access low-cost public financing for such projects as a way to save money overall. The northeast-based advocacy group Acadia Center is helping the six New England states explore financing models.

“My only priority for next session is to set the stage for some extension or enhancement of our solar incentives,” said energy co-chair Steinberg. “This is very important to me as the godfather of solar, as Katie Dykes once called me, and that will be very hard.

“Everybody says it’s over; federal government has killed solar, game over, there’s nothing Connecticut can do. I cannot accept that,” he said. “Solar is not only an industry here in the state, it is part of the solution for us. To abandon it and not offer any incentives, or to backtrack to the point where the incentives don’t stimulate actual implementation — shame on us.”

But there are other ways to indirectly reduce costs for solar; specifically by streamling permitting, the regulatory process and siting – soft costs, as they are sometimes called.

Massachusetts is already doing that.

“We’re going to have to throw everything we can at permitting, streamlining and reducing soft costs in order to support the affordability of more solar investment for grid-scale projects,” Dykes said.

Kat Burnham, senior principal at the consulting and policy group Advanced Energy United and the state lead for all three southern New England states, said Connecticut and other states need to step up and put some financial skin as well as policy in the game. She pointed to financial tools like the Green Bank.

“I think what’s important is to make sure that we’re looking at a range of different options and trying to find the right one that fits the particular need or situation,” she said. “What are the tools in our kit, and how do we use those so that we minimize our risk?”

She said there’s a cost to building things. And she said there’s “a cost to inaction … We can’t just sit on our hands and hope for the best.”

DEEP is also in the final throes of accepting bids for innovative energy efficiency and energy upgrade proposals designed to help lower energy bills.

In Massachusetts, for instance, all three major utilities — one of which is Eversource — have agreed to discount electric rates in the winter for people who use heat pumps. While they run on electricity, aside from being efficient, they free up other fuels like natural gas to run power plants. In Connecticut, DEEP is continuing with its focus of lowering the upfront installation costs for heat pumps.

Solutions

Barbara Kates-Garnick, a former Massachusetts energy official, now a professor of practice at Tufts University’s Fletcher School, said the path forward she sees is bringing together utilities, regulators, policy makers, other stakeholders and system participants to explore some of the out-of-the-box solutions.

“The answers aren’t clear, but I think we have to look at how we regulate, what we regulate, and come to some conversations with the utilities so that we come to a bigger grand bargain,” she said.

She noted, however, the Biden idea of promoting clean energy by providing incentives, funding and jobs — especially in red states — “when push comes to shove, it didn’t work.”

Dykes is not ruling out increasing fossil fuel-run power as part of Connecticut’s solution to the Trump anti-renewables effort.

“It’s a possibility,” she said, noting that Lamont has talked about the need to be open to natural gas as part of a solution.

If the offshore wind and other projects do not come online, she said, “that will certainly put us into a very challenging place in terms of having an adequate reserve margin and ability to maintain reliability even under some normal weather conditions.

“In light of that, we have to consider what are the alternatives that make the most sense to ensure we can continue to have an affordable, reliable grid in the early 2030s, and natural gas is part of that. Retaining those oil units — is that a solution that we’ll have to rely on?” Dykes said.

Dolan of the Power Generators Association, while also advocating continued use of the region’s gas and oil fleet, doesn’t have specific facilities he’d like to see targeted for reinvestment.

“I think there needs to be a refocus around the meat and potatoes about what is operating today and making sure it continues to operate tomorrow. Now the replacement energy supplies are not coming or not coming anytime soon, and for these power plants to be able to continue operating and operating at higher capacity, reinvestment is going to be necessary,” Dolan said, taking a thinly-veiled swipe at Connecticut, Massachusetts and Rhode Island, which all plan to have net-zero grids in the next 20 to 25 years.

For offshore wind proponents, it’s a rebuilding and refocusing period for the industry, said Oceantic’s Francoeur, who added that more than 100 turbine foundations and towers had been installed in the active offshore wind projects since construction season opened in May.

“The industry is going to weather this administration. Who knows what the next will bring,” she said. “But I think it won’t be the orderly advancement that it once could have been.”

Former BOEM Director Klein said she thinks it’s important for states to keep supporting the offshore wind projects that are underway.

“It’ll demonstrate to the project developers that there are important entities in the U.S. that are still supportive and want to find a path forward,” she said. “Folks aren’t building this for kicks, because it’s fun. This is about actual energy supply needs … and actually communities, when presented with alternatives, are likely to see that offshore wind is the best of the bunch.”

In the meantime, some of the wind focus may shift to Canada, where the provinces of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador are exploring the development of huge amounts of offshore and onshore wind. Whether New England will be able to access some of that is years and likely many diplomatic twists away.

The Trump administration’s pivot away from wind and solar in particular and back toward fossil fuels is already taking the U.S. globally out of step. Recent data from the European clean energy think tank, data and policy tracker Ember showed that worldwide, in the first six months of 2025, renewables overtook coal power for the first time. And it showed that the growth in solar and wind power outpaced the growth of demand in the same time period. But while fossil fuel generation and its emissions dropped in China and India, the world’s most populated countries, fossil fuel generation and emissions increased in the U.S. Clean generation growth did not keep pace with demand growth in the U.S.

“For a bunch of largely economic reasons, we do still think that solar and wind are going to out-compete fossil fuels,” said Kate Sinding Daly, senior vice president for law and policy at the New England-based Conservation Law Foundation, though she admitted the Trump actions are slowing down their adoption.

But she wondered whether the industry would be able to pivot enough in the face of multiple challenges to keep investors confident enough to continue.

“That, I guess, is the big question mark,” she said.

Dykes sees the same challenge.

“Investors need to know that after a multiyear permitting process, when you have a project that’s 80% constructed, that you can bring it online, sell your power and get your money back,” she said. “And if we can’t guarantee that in the Northeast or in the U.S. anymore, I think that affects the investment climate for all types of resources at a time when we can least afford to increase investor perception of risk.”

The energy committee’s Steinberg added a warning. “That’s an excuse to be paralyzed. That’s an excuse to basically throw up our hands and say, ‘we just have to wait out the feds,’” he said. “That’s going to mean that the ramping up stage is going to be even more complicated on the other side, assuming there is another side.”",https://assets.hartfordbusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Turbine_installation_underway_for_Revolution_Wind_opt-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-27 14:18:54.030824

BluWave-ai and Electricity Maps announced today a strategic partnership to eliminate data fragmentation and drive global decarbonization efforts across electric vehicle (EV) charging and energy storage optimization.

The partnership enables the suite of artificial intelligence software products from BluWave-ai, including EV Everywhere™ and Energy Storage Autopilot™, to scale deployment rapidly across new international markets by leveraging the standardized, high-resolution, and global grid data from Electricity Maps. BluWave-ai, as a pioneer in AI-driven energy optimization, has deep expertise backed by an intellectual property portfolio currently including 49 patent filings covering AI-based renewable energy and electric vehicle optimization.

From Fragmented Data to Optimized Action.

Across all electricity-intensive industries, companies face a major hurdle in acquiring and standardizing grid data which are inherently different at each utility. While integrating with a single grid is manageable, expanding solutions globally requires immense data preparation due to the vast array of incompatible formats and varying data maturities of grid operators worldwide. For global operators like BluWave-ai, which manage pools of distributed energy resources (DERs), storage and EV fleets across multiple regions, this complexity slowed down time to market and commissioning of AI products.

The need for a scalable, automated solution to manage this load intelligently is urgent with over 85 million EVs on the roads by the end of 2025. This will consume approximately 5.7 TWh of electricity per week, a demand comparable to approximately 143 large data centers over a week.

""By integrating the standardized API from Electricity Maps which provides access to real-time and historical grid signals across over 190 countries and zones, our AI models can adapt seamlessly without custom data preparation for each new market,"" said Thomas Triplet, VP of Technology at BluWave-ai, ""Our patented AI predictors and optimizers intake features from diverse data streams in a manner best suited to trigger high performance AI and generate our patent pending BluScore™ to forecast grid health in real-time. To enable fast time to operations, our team at BluWave-ai has built an interface to ingest from Electricity Maps activate our AI modes both for inference and continuous training. By setting up this system we have taken operationalization spanning multiple utilities from what could be multiple days or weeks to sub 1 hour.""

Real-Time Decarbonization and Optimization

The BluWave-ai software platform utilizes the data from Electricity Maps - including real-time grid signals for carbon intensity, power mix, and price information - to optimize customer operations, maximizing renewable energy utilization and lowering emissions globally.

Electricity Maps provides BluWave-ai with validated, standardized real-time data on grid carbon intensity and price signals, effectively acting as the crucial input layer. BluWave-ai's patented AI platform then executes complex, multi-variable optimization.

Specifically, the integration enhances BluWave-ai's product lines by allowing them to:

Dynamically calculating and scheduling energy assets (e.g., EVs, battery energy storage, and data centers) to maximize cost savings and minimize carbon intensity in real-time, a process that is unique to BluWave-ai's proprietary algorithms.

Creating a federated, virtual power plant capable of operating across diverse global markets without the costly, time-consuming effort of manual, one-off grid integrations.

""A big hurdle to deploying AI-driven optimization globally is data fragmentation. Grid data is messy, inconsistent, and often requires bespoke integration for every single geography to work consistently with AI models that require standardized input features,"" said Devashish Paul, CEO and Founder of BluWave-ai. ""With a European EV fleet projected to exceed 12 million and spread across dozens of distinct national power systems, the challenge of standardizing grid integration to manage this massive new load is paramount. This partnership with Electricity Maps provides the standardized, high-resolution foundation our AI platform needs to operate seamlessly across countries and electricity systems, dramatically reducing time to operationalize and revenue from customers.""

""Our mission is to empower everyone, from developers to global enterprise platforms, to build a truly sustainable future by providing transparent, actionable electricity data,"" said Olivier Corradi, CEO of Electricity Maps. ""By integrating our standardized, real-time grid signals, BluWave-ai's Energy Storage Autopilot and EV Everywhere platforms can make the most optimal decisions, ensuring that every charge and discharge cycle maximizes clean energy use and minimizes carbon emissions worldwide.""

BluWave-ai product information can be obtained from info@BluWave-ai.com for utilities interested in deploying EV Everywhere™ and system operators or IPPs with storage projects interested in Energy Storage Autopilot™

Topsoe, which last year received $135 million in advanced manufacturing tax credits, has “paused” its work on the Virginia plant ahead of reaching a final investment decision, spokesperson Gabe Martinez confirmed; the company is evaluating market conditions, such as demand and supply chain constraints before deciding if and when to move forward.

“Looking ahead, increased demand will be critical as the hydrogen industry matures,” Martinez told Latitude Media. “Unlocking that demand will require strong policy support, infrastructure investments, and continued cost reductions as production scales.”

The firm’s decision echoes a move made earlier this year by the Norwegian Nel Hydrogen to cancel its planned electrolyzer factory in Michigan. Together, they underscore the risk a nascent cleantech sector faces when priorities change under a new administration.

Martin Tengler, head of BloombergNEF’s hydrogen research, told Latitude Media that he is “not surprised” by Topsoe’s pull-back: “If there is no demand for green hydrogen, then there’s no demand for electrolyzers, the machines used to produce green hydrogen.”

When President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022, Tengler said, “everyone was super excited that the U.S. will have massive amounts of green hydrogen with this super generous tax credit, but then nothing happened.”

This is largely due to the Biden administration’s long delay in issuing the final 45V guidance, leaving it until just before leaving office. The months that the industry spent without clarity about what projects would be considered “green” and therefore eligible for the tax credits left many companies in limbo. And though the hydrogen sector mounted a largely successful lobbying effort this summer and ultimately came out ahead of wind and solar in the GOP’s “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” the credit’s two-year sunset has nonetheless compromised the U.S.’ appeal as a place to do business.

Hydrogen made with renewable-powered electrolyzers was dependent on the tax credit for making economics work. Now, the U.S. market is primed for cheaper blue hydrogen made with natural gas equipped with carbon capture and storage, which retained tax credits under OBBB.

Last year, BNEF reported a 94% plunge in green hydrogen investments, while spending on electrolyzer deployment tanked by orders of magnitude.

The shift across the pond

Topsoe, operating in the U.S. since 1940, announced plans in 2023 to build the country’s first and largest solid oxide electrolyzer factory in Richmond, Virginia, a move welcomed by Republican Governor Glenn Youngkin and Democratic Senators Mark Warner and Tim Kaine. The company was one of a half dozen to announce U.S. electrolyzer factories, banking on the $3 per kilogram tax credit to spur demand, as Latitude Media reported.

Now Topsoe is shifting its focus to Europe, where it will launch a 500 MW factory in Denmark on October 30. Its first customer, Texas-based First Ammonia has already signed an agreement for a 5 MW electrolyzer. Martinez emphasized that the company is “optimistic about the market” despite the global slowdown at present.

It is unclear if and when Topsoe will secure a final investment decision for its Richmond factory. For now, it has paused work on site design, supplier arrangements and financing. The firm says it welcomes the extension of the clean hydrogen tax credit to 2027, “which is one of several important signals supporting the growth of clean hydrogen in the United States” — but notes that’s not the only factor driving their decision.

“Our decision to pause pre-Final Investment Decision activities in Virginia reflects broader global market conditions — including the pace of global demand development, tightening financial conditions, and supply chain complexity — not a single policy outcome,” Topsoe said.

It’s not just European companies reconsidering their U.S. plans. With an absence of green hydrogen demand and a glut of electrolyzers, U.S.-based manufacturers are also eyeing exports, mainly to Europe and the Middle East and to a lesser extent to Asia Pacific, said Tengler. “It is such a difficult environment for electrolyzer manufacturers everywhere, but especially now in the United States.”

That is certainly true of the 10 currently operating factories in the U.S. and three still under construction today tracked by the Clean Investment Monitor, a joint project of the Rhodium Group and MIT CEEPR. New York-based Plug Power, which runs three of those factories, exported most of its electrolyzers to Europe last year, according to Tengler.

The California-based EvoloH, unlike Topsoe, is forging ahead with a single production line of half a gigawatt of electrolyzers in 2028 at its Center of Excellence in Lowell, Massachusetts, northeast of Boston. EvoloH has a few domestic clients, but it also is scouting for clients in Europe and Asia — but is excluding China, which already is mass-producing its own alkaline electrolyzers.

“The absence of a clean hydrogen tax credit has cast a cloud over U.S. demand for green hydrogen, but fortunately our business model was not based on government subsidies,” Scott Blanchet, EvoloH chief operating officer, told Latitude.",https://www.latitudemedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Latitude-1920px-32-Image-2025-10-27T105009.276.jpg,N,,2025-10-27 14:07:29.327836

“It’s time to pass a clean continuing resolution and end this shutdown today. No half measures, and no gamesmanship.”

For more than a month, Republicans have insisted on funding the government at current levels through Nov. 21 to allow time to negotiate longer-term spending.

However, Senate Democrats have blocked the so-called “clean” short-term spending bill a dozen times, instead demanding that Republicans make expensive concessions on healthcare policy in exchange for reopening the government.

Only three Democrat or Democrat-aligned senators have backed the House-passed stopgap measure: John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada and independent Angus King of Maine. Republicans need five more Democrats to flip and get the legislation past the 60-vote legislative filibuster.

“These are patriotic Americans – parents, caregivers, and veterans – forced to work without pay while struggling to cover rent, groceries, gas and medicine because of political disagreements in Washington. That is unacceptable,” Kelley stressed.

“Unfortunately, shutdowns have become a recurring tactic in Washington. But there is no ‘winning’ a government shutdown.”

At least 1.4 million government workers missed their full paycheck last week. According to federal law, public sector employees will receive back pay when the shutdown concludes. However, Kelley warned that many of his members are not prepared to go extended periods without compensation.

“When the folks who serve this country are standing in line for food banks after missing a second paycheck because of this shutdown, they aren’t looking for partisan spin,” he said. “They’re looking for the wages they earned. The fact that they’re being cheated out of it is a national disgrace.”

According to Aptera, there are over 50,000 reservations for this vehicle, which it plans to sell in four versions with up to 1,000 miles of range.","YouTuber Marques Brownlee drives the Aptera three-wheeler validation prototype, revealing many of its unique traits.

The vehicle in the video is very close to what Aptera intends to put into production starting next year.

This is clearly a vehicle designed for warmer climates, since it doesn't look like it would cope very well with ice and snow.

The Aptera three-wheeled solar-charging electric vehicle is what science fiction movies said cars would look like in 2025. It is so radically different from anything else on the road that even if it had four wheels, calling it a car wouldn’t do it justice. But it's been in the works for years, and we’re still not sure if it’s actually going to make production.

Yet Aptera says it's still in the game. And it lent one of its three-wheelers to someone outside the company to drive and document the experience. Marques Brownlee is that someone, and he made a video for his car channel called Auto Focus. He goes over the entire car, showing many details that we hadn’t had a good look at in Aptera’s official videos. It all seems to come together into a believable, production-ready package, even if it's not all final or functional yet.

Who knew that the way to open the doors and the cargo hatch in the back is to double-tap on specific parts of the body? I’m not sure how practical that is compared to a normal door handle, but it certainly adds to the futuristic aura that this vehicle has, as does the exposed forged carbon fiber that you see when opening it up.

And speaking of cargo room, even though the Aptera looks like it wouldn’t be that practical, it actually appears to be. Marques has no problem fitting in the trunk and, in fact, you could probably fit two Marqueses in there with some space to spare. There’s even an additional, deeper storage space in the trunk, which you access by lifting a little lid, and there are also tie-down points where you could fit a net to prevent stuff from rolling around while you drive.

Sitting in the driver’s seat, it immediately becomes obvious how few physical buttons there actually are in the Aptera. There are two of them on the steering wheel and one for the hazard lights, but that’s literally it. You control everything else, including the electric windows, through the touchscreen, which is the first time I’ve ever seen that in a vehicle. This will stay this way for production, as will most of the interior that you see in the video.

One less positive aspect of sitting in the three-wheeler is outward visibility. There’s a thick border where the part of the side window that opens meets the part that doesn’t, and that’s in your line of sight. This does seem to impair over-the-shoulder visibility, although this will vary depending on the driver’s height. That’s why Aptera put the feeds from the side cameras on screens right in front of the driver, to make it as easy as possible to see what’s around.

Driving the Aptera is more normal than you may think—the fact that it’s a three-wheeler isn’t really obvious until you encounter a pothole that you can’t avoid—but the visibility issue does become more apparent. The fact that the car doesn’t end where the body ends is also unusual and you have to get used to the fact that the wheels stick out when threading it through a narrow space.

Even though there is a lot of skepticism regarding this vehicle making production, Aptera still says it’s on track and has been posting regular updates. The fact that it has gotten this far may be surprising to some, but the road to the actual start of production is still uncertain. The company says it wants to start making this vehicle “as soon as possible.” It’s currently in the validation stage and the plan is to begin limited production in 2026 and then ramp up production through 2028.

According to Aptera, there are over 50,000 reservations for this vehicle, which it plans to sell in four versions with up to 1,000 miles of range. You will also be able to choose between two sizes of solar array, providing up to 22 or 40 miles of free range daily.

The launch version will have 400 miles of range and a target price of $40,000, while the lower-range base model, planned for future release, will have 250 miles of range and cost from around $28,000.",https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/Zn1Ole/s1/autofocus-aptera-drive.jpg,N,,2025-10-27 16:04:19.265111

Most significantly, the American Rescue Plan Act “enhanced” the premium tax credits, making them more generous and expanding eligibility by removing the 400 percent FPL subsidy cliff.
Unfortunately, despite a previous extension as part of the Inflation Reduction Act, these enhanced premium tax credits are set to expire at the end of the year.
The premium tax credits won’t go away entirely, but they would default back to their original inadequate levels.
In fact, in anticipation of the expiration of the enhanced tax credits, insurers are already promising enormous increases in premiums.","At the heart of the current federal budget standoff lies an esoteric but consequential policy choice: whether to extend the enhanced premium tax credits (EPTCs) that help millions afford health coverage. But what exactly are EPTCs, and what would letting them expire mean?

The Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplace was set up to provide individuals the ability to purchase health insurance for themselves and their families. It was part of the ACA’s larger strategy to extend health insurance coverage to as many as possible: expand Medicaid eligibility, require employers of 50 or more to provide adequate and affordable coverage through employer-sponsored insurance (ESI), and provide an individual market option for those not eligible under other categories (e.g., independent contractors, self-employed workers, and employees of small businesses).

The ACA also made important changes to the way insurance companies were allowed to do business. They were no longer allowed to deny health insurance to individuals because of “preexisting conditions,” and they could not charge people more for having those conditions or for “lifestyle” factors like obesity. Of course, insurance companies only make money if they take in more than they pay out, and that is harder to do when they are required to cover everyone and to do so at the same price regardless of risk. So the ACA included a variety of sticks and carrots to encourage younger and relatively healthier people to obtain health insurance. This included the “individual mandate”—a tax imposed on individuals who did not purchase insurance coverage—and the “premium tax credits.”

The premium tax credits are meant to subsidize the cost of purchasing an insurance plan on the ACA marketplace. They are available to people who do not already have adequate and affordable health insurance coverage offered through their employer (whether or not the employer is subject to the mandate). They are fully refundable and in many cases can be claimed in advance and paid by the government directly to the insurer at the time of purchasing insurance on the marketplace. In theory, they should have made quality health insurance affordable for consumers and profitable for insurers to offer. However, things didn’t go as planned for the ACA.

The Supreme Court made the Medicaid expansion optional for states, and several states have refused to implement it. That means millions are trapped in the “Medicaid gap”: too poor to qualify for the ACA marketplace and not poor enough to qualify for legacy Medicaid.

The Supreme Court made the Medicaid expansion optional for states, and several states have refused to implement it. That means millions are trapped in the “Medicaid gap”: too poor to qualify for the ACA marketplace and not poor enough to qualify for legacy Medicaid. And those who did qualify for the marketplace in these states often found insurance too expensive to purchase even with the subsidy support. On top of this, Congress, as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, set the individual mandate penalty to $0, effectively ending it.

Meanwhile, the premium tax credits proved to be inadequate more generally. Individuals were expected to contribute to their premiums on a sliding scale according to their household income. For example, those between 100 and 133 percent of the federal poverty line (FPL) were expected to contribute 2.1 percent of their income to premiums each year. This percentage rose and the subsidy fell as income rose until the household reached 400 percent of the FPL, at which point the subsidy abruptly ended in a cliff.

There was no theory behind these numbers or this range. They were merely what could be offered given the politically feasible revenue structure available when the ACA was first passed. This meant that the marketplace was unaffordable for millions of American families—a problem that, when combined with the end of the individual mandate, threatened the health of the marketplace. When insurance becomes too expensive and there is no penalty for remaining uninsured, those who opt out tend to be younger and healthier, while those who stay enrolled are generally older or have greater health needs. Economists call this “adverse selection.” This dynamic has led some insurers to leave the marketplace and others to raise premiums to offset the higher costs of a poor “risk pool.”

When the Biden administration took office, it introduced a series of measures to strengthen and improve the ACA marketplace. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS), for example, addressed the long-standing “family glitch,” which had created problems in how employer-sponsored insurance affordability standards interacted with premium tax credit eligibility. Most significantly, the American Rescue Plan Act “enhanced” the premium tax credits, making them more generous and expanding eligibility by removing the 400 percent FPL subsidy cliff. Under these changes, families below 150 percent of the federal poverty line no longer have to contribute anything toward premiums for a benchmark silver plan, and families at higher income levels pay substantially less than they would have before.

The result has been tens of millions of new marketplace users, over 4 million people no longer uninsured, a healthier marketplace with more options, and many millions of dollars in savings for millions of American families. Sounds good, right? Unfortunately, despite a previous extension as part of the Inflation Reduction Act, these enhanced premium tax credits are set to expire at the end of the year. As with many initiatives passed through budget reconciliation, the EPTCs were not made permanent. And the most recent reconciliation package did not include an extension of the EPTCs, leaving their future uncertain. So what will happen if there isn’t a deal before then?

The premium tax credits won’t go away entirely, but they would default back to their original inadequate levels. Some families will no longer be eligible for the tax credits at all. Those still eligible will see their total subsidy drop considerably. Experts expect almost 5 million people to lose their health insurance as a result. This will hit rural communities and people in states, mostly in the South, that have not expanded Medicaid particularly hard. Millions more will only be able to maintain health insurance coverage by downgrading their plan to one with higher deductibles and more limited coverage, a recipe for more medical debt in a country that already has a medical debt crisis. The marketplace will become more expensive, not just because of the lost subsidies but because of another factor: Remember adverse selection and the risk pools? The first people to leave will be relatively younger and healthier. Those who stay behind will be relatively sick. As a result, insurers will have to raise their premiums because the average cost of insuring sicker people is higher (which can set off further cycles of pool shrinking and cost increases). In fact, in anticipation of the expiration of the enhanced tax credits, insurers are already promising enormous increases in premiums. And others may throw in the towel altogether.

So there will be fewer, more expensive options. And there will be less aid to cover these more expensive options . . . a “double whammy” that will subject millions of families to truly shocking costs at a time when they are already struggling with rising prices.

So there will be fewer, more expensive options.

The “Charge as you drive” project, spearheaded by a consortium, including VINCI Autoroutes, Electreon, VINCI Construction, Gustave Eiffel University, and Hutchinson, is testing a system that allows electric vehicles, from heavy-duty trucks to passenger cars, to recharge directly from the road while driving.

The core promise of this Electric Road System (ERS) could drastically reduce the required size of vehicle batteries. Smaller batteries mean vehicles that are less expensive, lighter, and more energy-efficient. As a result, it increases cargo capacity and eliminates downtime for stationary charging. This also brings substantial environmental benefits, reducing the demand for raw materials and lowering the carbon footprint associated with battery manufacturing.

Charge As You Drive

Following extensive laboratory tests and mechanical durability trials, induction coils were installed over 1.5 km of the A10 roadway. Now, prototype vehicles, including a truck, utility vehicle, car, and bus, are driving on the motorway under real traffic conditions.

The initial findings are highly encouraging. Three laboratories from Gustave Eiffel University conducted on-site test campaigns. They reported that “the installed inductive system can safely deliver peak power above 300 kW and average power above 200 kW under optimal steady-state conditions.”

Consortium leaders see this as a pivotal validation of the technology.

“The initial results of the ongoing trials on a section of the A10 motorway confirm the findings of previous studies,” Nicolas Notebaert, CEO of VINCI Concessions and President of VINCI Autoroutes, said. “Deploying this technology on France’s main road networks, in addition to charging stations, will further accelerate the electrification of heavy-vehicle fleets—and thereby reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the freight and logistics sector, which alone accounts for more than 16% of the country’s total emissions.”

Oren Ezer, Electreon’s CEO, emphasized the technological achievement. “This is a pivotal moment in the global development of electric roads,” he said. “The system’s outstanding performance, demonstrated through the project and verified by independent laboratories in France, shows that our technology is the only one capable of delivering dynamic vehicle charging with such power and reliability—without any competitors able to match its standard.”",https://www.tomorrowsworldtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Untitled-design-43.png,N,,2025-10-27 14:06:39.833885

“It’s critical that the government continues to work closely with the sector to maintain ambition for the upcoming auction rounds for offshore wind and other technologies.”","Industry has urged the UK government to reconsider the budget made available to offshore wind projects in the AR7 Contracts for Difference auction.

It follows today’s earlier announcement that London will allocate £1.08bn across fixed-bottom and floating technologies.

Trade association RenewableUK warned that the figure “will not maximise investment” into new projects and is likely to cover only about a quarter of the 20GW of eligible capacity for this year’s tender.

Energy department DESNZ has confirmed £900m will be made available to fixed-bottom wind projects, with a further £180m for floating schemes ahead of a bidding window next month.

RUK executive director of policy and engagement Ana Musat said: “Given the amount of competition in this year’s auction, we expect to see competitively-priced bids, so the government should adjust the budget to maximise procurement, which could attract up to £53bn in private investment in the UK economy.

“It’s important that this allocation round supports further development of floating wind technology. Early investment in these demonstration-scale projects will help build up supply chains and bring down costs to enable us to scale up in the next decade.

“Every gigawatt of new offshore wind capacity we install boosts our economy by £2-3bn, and with the right level of support we can more than double the number of offshore wind jobs from 40,000 now to 95,000 by 2030.

“This would strengthen our energy security, drive economic growth and reduce our exposure to volatile gas prices.”

The trade group added an “ambitious pipeline” of renewable energy projects is “crucial for triggering large-scale private investment” in offshore wind supply chains and manufacturing.

Scottish Renewables chief executive Claire Mack also urged the government to “carefully consider” the budget to reassure investors of its commitment to wind farms off Scotland.

“This year’s auction is a pivotal moment to inject fresh momentum into Scotland’s offshore wind sector and build on the strategic investments made in our supply chain to date,” Mack said.

“An auction that fails to deliver for Scotland will seriously undermine our ability to maintain and secure the growth that is essential for energy security.

“A record amount of capacity is eligible for AR7 and this fierce competition will ensure new capacity is secured at the best possible value to consumers, despite increasing global cost pressures.

“The budget announced today would significantly restrict that value from reaching consumers and communities. We urge careful consideration to ensure the final budget best delivers on our long-term national interests.

“Given no contracts have been awarded to new fixed-bottom projects in Scotland since 2022, the industry needs to be reassured that the UK government remains committed to continued deployment of Scottish fixed and floating offshore wind projects.

“This will be critical for driving economic prosperity across all corners of the country, including the North East of Scotland.”

The UK government’s head of Clean Power 2030 Chris Stark said bids for fixed-bottom wind farms will “by design” likely exceed the budget limit, noting London’s new ability in this year’s auction to contract more offshore wind generation later in the process by adjusting the budget if it sees value for money.

“For the first time, we will be able to ‘see’ the bid stack (but not the bidders) beyond the agreed budget and make informed decisions to contract for more offshore wind capacity at a price that offers real value to consumers,” Stark stated.

Energy UK’s director of policy and advocacy Adam Berman said the AR7 budget is a “step in the right direction” towards a secure UK energy system with offshore wind as the backbone of the UK’s renewables capacity.

“It’s right that the government is focused on procuring renewables projects that represent best value for money,"" Berman added. ""This is only the start of the auction process, and expanding the budget remains a possibility if it can represent strong value to consumers and the broader economy.

“Today’s budget announcement will provide investors with the confidence needed to continue investing millions of pounds every day to secure our country’s energy future.

“It’s critical that the government continues to work closely with the sector to maintain ambition for the upcoming auction rounds for offshore wind and other technologies.”",https://renews.biz/media/24755/generic_offshore_credit_insung_yoon_unsplash.jpeg?width=640,N,,2025-10-27 14:06:44.593097

One notable example of green employment is the Misa Campus Complex, a newly licensed investment project located in Tan Thuan Export Processing Zone, implemented by Kotia SaiGon Joint Stock Company. With a total investment of 600 billion VND (22.8 million USD), the project focuses on software production, IT services, and technology transfer consulting — all key sectors of the green economy.

Company Director Nguyen Thi Ngoan shared that green jobs at the company go beyond creating a smoke-free, low-emission workspace. They also foster open, innovative environments that require employees to master technology and integrate artificial intelligence into work processes. The company has about 2,000 staff members, mainly specialising in implementing accounting, education management, and operations software.

In Tan Thuan Export Processing Zone, one of the pioneers in transforming traditional industrial models towards greener practices, efforts are underway to attract technology enterprises and develop high-quality human resources training services. The goal is to establish innovation centres contributing to the development of a smart hub in the southern part of the city.

At Tan Tao Industrial Park, a rooftop solar power company is currently recruiting design engineers, installation technicians, and system operation consultants. A representative from its HR department said this sector directly contributes to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, protecting ecosystems, and adapting to climate change.

Alongside manufacturing, clean energy and green transport are also generating new workforce demands. According to the Ho Chi Minh City Department of Home Affairs, the demand for labour in renewable energy and electric vehicles is expected to grow by 12–15% annually through 2030. These sectors are essential for the city’s goal of converting 100% of public transport vehicles to electric power by 2030, contributing to the national commitment to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.

The International Labour Organisation (ILO) also reports a rapid increase in green jobs across industries such as renewable energy, waste management and recycling, sustainable construction, and environmental protection. As more businesses adopt cleaner production methods and eco-friendly technologies, the demand for “green” human resources continues to rise.

Green jobs as a driver of growth

According to Nguyen Thi Thu Trang, Brand Director of Manpower Viet Nam, a recruitment and HR consultancy, the green transition is projected to create around 30 million jobs globally by 2030, fundamentally reshaping the labour market. Green jobs are emerging across all industries — from sustainable materials engineering and electric vehicle charging technicians to smart transport system operators and urban agriculture experts.

However, the rising demand comes with significant challenges regarding workforce quality. “Up to 75% of employers struggle to find skilled workers, and 94% of businesses report difficulty recruiting candidates who meet ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) standards,” Trang noted.

To ensure green jobs become a true driver of development, workers must take responsibility for upskilling and learning new competencies, while businesses and authorities must play an active role in enabling this transition. Employers need to invest in systematic internal training, and educational institutions should align their programmes with green and sustainable development goals.

As the country’s economic powerhouse, Ho Chi Minh City is entering a new stage of development centred on innovation and green growth. In this context, green jobs are no longer a passing trend but a fundamental component of the city’s sustainable development strategy. From industrial parks undergoing transformation and booming tech enterprises to policies promoting clean energy transition, a vibrant green employment ecosystem is clearly taking shape.

Therefore, building a comprehensive training system and forecasting labour market demands aligned with green industries is imperative. This requires close coordination between state agencies, vocational education systems, and enterprises to ensure a skilled workforce and create greater development opportunities for workers.",https://en-cdn.nhandan.vn/images/3c6b1d7d6cd77f0dc549536a41e2cb9b45a71e1dbdb5406c25f1d8c9a6d0e61cc0308870180c38777f2c575365c82f066ae70becd9f49b834a8b9195e077c25b/viec1.jpg.webp,N,,2025-10-27 16:23:41.095718

The retail price of electricity for residential customers was up 6.1% in August over the same month last year, reaching an average of 17.62 cents/kWh, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration’s monthly update on electricity released Friday.

Total net generation and retail sales were down slightly, by 0.8% and 0.5% respectively, which experts attributed to a mild summer in much of the eastern part of the country. Nationally, there were 9.1% fewer cooling days this August compared to August 2024, though parts of the West saw between 5% and 50% more.

Natural gas prices were up 47.4% to just over $3/MMBtu, per Henry Hub, and natural gas consumption fell 5.6%.

Dive Insight:

Aaron Denman, who heads Bain & Company’s Americas utilities and renewables practice, said the reasons behind the rise in prices are complicated and nuanced, and vary depending on region.

“I think if you look at aggregate headline numbers, it’s hard to blame data centers for much of the increase, and I think part of that is just because it’s still such a small percentage of the overall load,” Denman said. “But I think when you get into specific regions, they’re so large, they’re so meaningful, that you can start to see some of that impact.”

He said Bain’s projections put data centers at about 40% to 60% of new load growth in the coming years, with manufacturing and electrification making up most of the remainder. He said the longterm fundamentals remain strong for load growth, despite some recent negative economic data. U.S. factory activity shrank in September for a seventh consecutive month, according to Bloomberg.

“This [much] load growth, this fast, is going to put upward pressure on residential prices,” Denman said. “We’re going to need to see creative solutions to minimize the impact on particularly residential customers.”

Impacts to residential customers are fast becoming a political concern among constituents who were promised by President Donald Trump during his campaign that he would cut energy and electricity prices in half within 12 months, said Heather Reams, president and CEO of Citizens for Responsible Energy Solutions, which describes itself as a right-of center non-profit.

She said the EIA data confirms what she has been hearing from voters and politicians alike.

“This isn’t a myth or fake news ... prices are indeed going up, and voters at some point are going to be asking, ‘Who’s responsible for this?’” Reams said.

Reams said permitting reform is desperately needed, but Republicans, in particular, are hesitant to take strong positions without a signal from the White House.

“The president really should be weighing in here if he wants to see things developed, built, meeting the challenges,” she said.

For Jorge Vargas, co-founder and CEO of solar developer Aspen Power, the EIA’s data confirms that the Trump administration’s actions targeting renewable energy are effecting prices. He pointed out that prices were up though less electricity was being generated and sold.

“I hate to be right about this, but it’s like they’re curtailing generation at a time where there’s a lot of demand, and consumers and businesses are going to be the ones who pay for this,” he said.

Vargas added that many other factors, including an aging grid and insufficient transmission, also play a role. He said the U.S. needs a predictable regulatory landscape and a diversified energy system to keep electricity affordable and reliable.

“These are 30-year assets,” he said. “These are critical infrastructure assets that should have a very stable regulatory framework governing them — unfortunately it isn’t.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/Ad-ivOzMYw-VmqJ1hqxIrgpdRN5Qbft-Vik12Y_A568/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9wb3dlcl9saW5lX2hvdXN0b24uanBn.webp,N,,2025-10-27 13:09:02.827868

The rapid rise in electricity demand, following decades of stagnation, will challenge utilities in a few ways, according to Morningstar.
Uncertainty around needed data center capacity “makes it challenging for utilities to accurately forecast future power demand and the required investment,” according to the report.
“Utilities are increasingly looking to private capital to fill funding gaps,” while increased ratepayer-funded investments lead to regulatory lag.","U.S. electric utilities are entering a five-year capital expenditure “super-cycle” as they build out transmission and generation networks to meet new demand from data centers, Morningstar DBRS said in a Monday research note.

“Investment in electricity infrastructure is projected to be $1.4 trillion from 2025 to 2030, double the amount invested in the prior 10 years,” the firm said. And based on data from the North American Electric Reliability Corp., Morningstar said many regions can expect load growth to increase from previously estimated 6.1% to around 11.6% over the next decade.

“The challenges posed by the rapid buildout of data centers are overlaid on existing concerns for most utilities, including decarbonization and guaranteeing the reliability of grid infrastructure while increasing the contribution of renewable power,” Morningstar said. “The projected surge in demand provides opportunities for utilities that must be counterbalanced with structural changes and regulatory support for utilities and rate payers.”

“We anticipate that regulated utilities with supportive regulatory commissions, solid credit ratings, and access to capital markets will deploy the needed capex to take advantage of the data center boom,” Bukola Folashakin, Morningstar assistant vice president of corporate ratings, said in a statement. “We expect this capex investment in turn to make such utility locations attractive for more data center construction, potentially creating a cycle of increased revenue for as long as data centers remain economically viable.”

Some states — Morningstar named California, Texas, and Louisiana — will see elevated risks of resource inadequacy next year that “in extreme conditions, could trigger electricity shortfalls,” according to the note.

Morningstar’s analysis mirror’s recent capital expenditure estimates from the Edison Electric Institute, which expects U.S electricity generation to grow “for the foreseeable future.” The group, which represents investor-owned utilities, said generation rose 3% in 2024 and generation investments as a share of the industry’s total capital expenditures have risen for four straight years.

The rapid rise in electricity demand, following decades of stagnation, will challenge utilities in a few ways, according to Morningstar.

Uncertainty around needed data center capacity “makes it challenging for utilities to accurately forecast future power demand and the required investment,” according to the report. And those data centers bring demand surges that are driving “higher tolls for other customer segments,” which “will be exacerbated as more data centers become operational.”

Meeting the demand requires massive utility investment but “traditional funding sources are inadequate to meet future investment needs,” Morningstar said. “Utilities are increasingly looking to private capital to fill funding gaps,” while increased ratepayer-funded investments lead to regulatory lag.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/394xNrqpS7J8fSDfaMxdYfQujziRSKf4QV8geqE2rIk/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS81MzEwNjc4MDM2MV80YWRmMzMxMDFmX2suanBn.webp,N,,2025-10-27 14:07:05.791449

Affordable coverage keeps people healthy, keeps workers on the job, and keeps hospitals financially stable.
Congress should act now — not next year or next month — to make these tax credits permanent and protect affordable health care for Michigan families.
You can help protect affordable health care by contacting your lawmakers today.","For millions of Michiganders, affordable health insurance isn’t just a policy issue. It’s peace of mind. It’s knowing that an unexpected illness won’t mean financial ruin, and that parents can take their kids to the doctor without worrying about the bill.

But that security is at risk. The enhanced premium tax credits, which have made coverage under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) affordable for families, small business owners and individuals, are at risk of vanishing without action from Congress.

If these enhancements are allowed to lapse, thousands of Michigan families could see their monthly premiums skyrocket, increasing by hundreds of dollars per month. That’s not just a bureaucratic detail buried in the federal budget. It’s a kitchen-table crisis that will hit real people across Michigan.

The premium tax credit (PTC) enhancements were first expanded under the American Rescue Plan and later extended through the Inflation Reduction Act. They capped what families pay for coverage as a percentage of income, dramatically reducing costs for many. For example, a family of four earning $65,000 annually would see their annual premiums increase by 208% on average if these credits are allowed to expire. For older adults, self-employed workers and families already stretched thin by rising costs for housing, food and prescriptions, that’s simply unaffordable.

The result would be devastating. Families would drop their health insurance altogether, hospitals and clinics would see more uncompensated care, and communities would face the ripple effects of poorer health outcomes and increased financial stress. At a time when Michigan’s health care system is already under strain from workforce shortages, inflation and cuts to Medicaid, allowing premiums to spike would be a serious step backward.

We’ve seen what happens when coverage becomes unaffordable. Before the ACA and these enhanced tax credits, too many people were forced to choose between paying their rent and paying their premiums. The coverage gap widened, emergency rooms filled with preventable crises and uncompensated care costs rose.

For Michigan’s small businesses, this issue goes beyond compassion. It’s about competitiveness. When health coverage becomes unaffordable, employees lose access to care, productivity drops and absenteeism rises. Workers who skip routine care or delay treatment for chronic conditions are more likely to miss work or leave the workforce entirely. The tax credits have helped small business owners attract and retain employees by keeping coverage affordable and predictable.

Losing these tax credits will ultimately drive up costs that employers, hospitals and taxpayers will pay.

In Michigan, state leaders are already stepping up to defend these critical protections. Senate Resolution 81, sponsored by Sen. Kevin Hertel, urges Congress and the President to permanently extend the enhanced tax credits, recognizing that affordable coverage isn't just about health, it's about economic stability, workforce strength, and community well-being.

Maintaining these tax credits isn’t about politics. It’s about priorities. Every lawmaker who claims to care about working families, small businesses, and economic stability should view this as common sense. Affordable coverage keeps people healthy, keeps workers on the job, and keeps hospitals financially stable. It also ensures that people can access preventive care before minor problems become costly emergencies.

The enhanced premium tax credits are among the most effective bipartisan tools we have to make health care accessible. Allowing them to expire would undo years of progress, widen health disparities, and increase costs for everyone. Congress should act now — not next year or next month — to make these tax credits permanent and protect affordable health care for Michigan families.

Health care coverage is a lifeline. No one should have to lose it because of inaction in Washington. Michigan’s families and businesses deserve stability, not uncertainty. We must continue to build on what works and not tear it down.

Community groups, from South Lanarkshire to the Highlands, will be given the chance to lease one of 10 publicly-owned Forestry Land and Scotland (FLS) sites with windfarms as they approach repowering.

The pilot, which makes changes to the Community Asset Transfer Scheme (CATS), will provide a protected window for local groups to make an asset transfer request to lease FLS sites to extend the operational life of the windfarms.

The new approach, developed with FLS, will help strengthen the community asset transfer process which enables communities to request to buy or lease publicly owned land they feel they could make better use of.

Other changes to CATS will see community groups given:

advance notification of upcoming lease opportunities, so they have time to prepare asset transfer requests before sites go to market

dedicated guidance for repowering projects, including support on financing projects, evaluation and governance

targeted support through the Community and Renewable Energy Scheme (CARES), including help to develop proposals

Energy Secretary Gillian Martin said:

“Ownership and control of land is a powerful tool for communities to drive change and can help to develop local economies, provide activities and services, and boost community identity.

“These new measures will make it easier for groups across Scotland to reap the rewards from renewable energy projects on Forestry Land Scotland sites with the potential to deliver real benefits to a local area.

“It is yet another way that we are ensuring that communities can benefit from Scotland’s transition to renewable energy and that we are helping provide a just transition to net zero for people across the country.”

Community Energy Scotland CEO Zoe Holliday said:

""We have seen time and time again the transformation impact of land ownership and ownership of energy assets on communities across Scotland.

""Right now, repowering of private developments represents one of the biggest opportunities to upscale the community energy sector at pace and meet the Scottish Government's community energy targets; community energy groups are increasingly ambitious but gaining grid access continues to be a challenge, which is why taking on existing sites has so much potential.

BluWave-ai and Electricity Maps announced today a strategic partnership to eliminate data fragmentation and drive global decarbonization efforts across electric vehicle (EV) charging and energy storage optimization.

The partnership enables the suite of artificial intelligence software products from BluWave-ai, including EV Everywhere™ and Energy Storage Autopilot™, to scale deployment rapidly across new international markets by leveraging the standardized, high-resolution, and global grid data from Electricity Maps. BluWave-ai, as a pioneer in AI-driven energy optimization, has deep expertise backed by an intellectual property portfolio currently including 49 patent filings covering AI-based renewable energy and electric vehicle optimization.

From Fragmented Data to Optimized Action.

Across all electricity-intensive industries, companies face a major hurdle in acquiring and standardizing grid data which are inherently different at each utility. While integrating with a single grid is manageable, expanding solutions globally requires immense data preparation due to the vast array of incompatible formats and varying data maturities of grid operators worldwide. For global operators like BluWave-ai, which manage pools of distributed energy resources (DERs), storage and EV fleets across multiple regions, this complexity slowed down time to market and commissioning of AI products.

The need for a scalable, automated solution to manage this load intelligently is urgent with over 85 million EVs on the roads by the end of 2025. This will consume approximately 5.7 TWh of electricity per week, a demand comparable to approximately 143 large data centers over a week.

""By integrating the standardized API from Electricity Maps which provides access to real-time and historical grid signals across over 190 countries and zones, our AI models can adapt seamlessly without custom data preparation for each new market,"" said Thomas Triplet, VP of Technology at BluWave-ai, ""Our patented AI predictors and optimizers intake features from diverse data streams in a manner best suited to trigger high performance AI and generate our patent pending BluScore™ to forecast grid health in real-time. To enable fast time to operations, our team at BluWave-ai has built an interface to ingest from Electricity Maps activate our AI modes both for inference and continuous training. By setting up this system we have taken operationalization spanning multiple utilities from what could be multiple days or weeks to sub 1 hour.""

Real-Time Decarbonization and Optimization

The BluWave-ai software platform utilizes the data from Electricity Maps - including real-time grid signals for carbon intensity, power mix, and price information - to optimize customer operations, maximizing renewable energy utilization and lowering emissions globally.

Electricity Maps provides BluWave-ai with validated, standardized real-time data on grid carbon intensity and price signals, effectively acting as the crucial input layer. BluWave-ai's patented AI platform then executes complex, multi-variable optimization.

Specifically, the integration enhances BluWave-ai's product lines by allowing them to:

Dynamically calculating and scheduling energy assets (e.g., EVs, battery energy storage, and data centers) to maximize cost savings and minimize carbon intensity in real-time, a process that is unique to BluWave-ai's proprietary algorithms.

Creating a federated, virtual power plant capable of operating across diverse global markets without the costly, time-consuming effort of manual, one-off grid integrations.

""A big hurdle to deploying AI-driven optimization globally is data fragmentation. Grid data is messy, inconsistent, and often requires bespoke integration for every single geography to work consistently with AI models that require standardized input features,"" said Devashish Paul, CEO and Founder of BluWave-ai. ""With a European EV fleet projected to exceed 12 million and spread across dozens of distinct national power systems, the challenge of standardizing grid integration to manage this massive new load is paramount. This partnership with Electricity Maps provides the standardized, high-resolution foundation our AI platform needs to operate seamlessly across countries and electricity systems, dramatically reducing time to operationalize and revenue from customers.""

""Our mission is to empower everyone, from developers to global enterprise platforms, to build a truly sustainable future by providing transparent, actionable electricity data,"" said Olivier Corradi, CEO of Electricity Maps. ""By integrating our standardized, real-time grid signals, BluWave-ai's Energy Storage Autopilot and EV Everywhere platforms can make the most optimal decisions, ensuring that every charge and discharge cycle maximizes clean energy use and minimizes carbon emissions worldwide.""

The natural gas industry has been telling the public that domestic natural gas production will continue to rise dramatically through mid-century.
That would produce a double squeeze on natural gas supplies as LNG exports continue rise in the face of falling domestic natural gas production leaving less for U.S. natural gas consumers.","The noticeable upward tilt in graphs of the U.S. natural gas price since April 2024 is likely a hint of things to come for U.S. consumers of energy. That's because record amounts of U.S. natural gas are now being sent abroad in the form of liquefied natural gas (LNG). And much more export capacity is planned. The U.S. Energy Information Administration forecasts that U.S. LNG export capacity will double by 2029. That's all gas that cannot be delivered to American users.

I have written about these trends (see here, here, here and here) and predicted they would mean considerably higher heating and electricity costs for Americans and much higher costs for American-based chemical manufacturers; for industries that rely on natural gas for process heat in the manufacture of steel and other metals, concrete, and glass; and for farmers who use natural gas to dry crops.

There's been a lot of talk about U.S. ""energy dominance"" by which the current administration means policies that maximize production, maximize exports, and yet somehow ""reduce energy costs"" at the same time. It's the ""reduce energy costs"" part that is now running into trouble.

A central cause of rising U.S. natural gas consumption (and ultimately prices) is the vast expansion of natural gas-fired power plants by American utility companies. From 2001 through 2024 electricity generated by natural gas has almost tripled while coal-generated electricity has declined dramatically and nuclear and hydroelectric generation have plateaued. Renewables (not including hydroelectric) grew 10-fold in that period, now nearly matching nuclear in percentage terms, nuclear at 18 percent and renewables at 17 percent. But, today natural gas is by far the leading fuel for electricity generation in the United States providing 43 percent of the country's electricity.

Cheap natural gas provided by the so-called ""shale revolution"" in the United States that began in the late 2000s has also prompted considerable expansion of the chemical industry which uses natural gas to make agricultural chemicals (especially fertilizers), methanol, and chemicals such as ethylene and propylene used to produce plastics. Related: Heat Pumps Face Their Toughest Test Yet

And, of course, Americans continue to use copious amounts of natural gas to heat their homes and businesses.

All that rising consumption spells trouble for American consumers when it comes to energy costs. The natural gas industry has been telling the public that domestic natural gas production will continue to rise dramatically through mid-century. But independent analysis based on the actual performance of gas wells suggests that production will plateau and then decline in the not-too-distant future. That would produce a double squeeze on natural gas supplies as LNG exports continue rise in the face of falling domestic natural gas production leaving less for U.S. natural gas consumers.

When the natural gas industry sold the story of endless abundance in order to get the U.S. Department of Energy to allow expansion of natural gas exports, it knew that such a move would increasingly link U.S. domestic prices to the much higher global prices. In fairness, the industry was simply asking for what had been granted to almost all other American industries, namely, the right to sell products to the highest bidders no matter where they may be.

In an age of increasing focus on the importance of domestic production of strategic resources, the U.S. government may yet come to regret its decision to commit so much of America's natural gas resources to other countries. Will there come a day when the anger of American consumers over high energy costs due to rising natural gas prices causes the government to force LNG exporters to abrogate their export contracts and keep that gas in America for consumption by American households and American businesses? The clock is now ticking.

Nissan said in a statement: “Nissan has formed a pool with BYD for its CO2 fleet emissions in Europe for the 2025 calendar year.
But under the car pooling arrangement, car manufacturers can pay electric car companies to use their zero emissions record to average out the pollution from sales of their combustion engine cars to avoid fines.
The industry in the past has said the 2025 emissions targets could have led to as much as €15bn (£13.03bn) in fines.
The latest car pooling agreement, confirmed by Nissan, mirrors that of other companies who have teamed up with other big name electric car brands including Tesla and Polestar.","The Japanese carmaker Nissan is to team up with its Chinese electric vehicle rival BYD in an attempt to offset their carbon emissions and avoid EU penalties for 2025, it has confirmed.

It is part of a wider offsetting scheme the EU has sanctioned for the car industry that could help manufacturers of combustion engine cars head off an estimated £13bn in fines.

Nissan said in a statement: “Nissan has formed a pool with BYD for its CO2 fleet emissions in Europe for the 2025 calendar year. The scope of the agreement covers passenger vehicles within EU markets and will contribute to Nissan’s commitment towards zero emissions in a sustainable way, while continuing to support the EU’s 2050 decarbonisation target.”

It added that it had entered into the agreement to “ensure the business is better able to comply with EU regulations and continue the transition towards our own goal of zero emissions”.

Chinese exports of EVs to the EU are already posing an existential crisis to the European car industry but are now, like Tesla, helping traditional car firms meet their decarbonisation targets courtesy of an EU regulation that in effect allows car firms to “pool” emissions.

The EU has already extended the period for compliance with emissions rules from one year to three years, fuelling fears this will further delay the already slow take-up of EVs in the EU, particularly in southern Europe, but also in key states such as France and Germany.

Fredrik Eklund, responsible for carbon credits trading at the Chinese-owned Swedish brand Polestar, which only makes electric vehicles, said: “It risks delaying the transition from legacy cars to EVs. We are already seeing car manufacturers pushing at the 2027 expiry date, but from our point of view and from the point of view of society, we really don’t want to delay this.”

Under the rules, car manufacturers have to meet emissions targets of 93.6g of CO2 per kilometre.

But under the car pooling arrangement, car manufacturers can pay electric car companies to use their zero emissions record to average out the pollution from sales of their combustion engine cars to avoid fines.

The industry in the past has said the 2025 emissions targets could have led to as much as €15bn (£13.03bn) in fines.

The latest car pooling agreement, confirmed by Nissan, mirrors that of other companies who have teamed up with other big name electric car brands including Tesla and Polestar.

Polestar has a pooling arrangement with Mercedes-Benz, Volvo and Smart cars, while Tesla’s zero emissions record is being mopped up by Toyota, Ford, Mazda, Alfa Romeo and Suzuki.

The price car companies are paying EV firms to offset their emissions remains confidential. But in January it was reported that carbon credit sales accounted for almost 3% of Tesla’s $72bn (£54bn) total revenue in the first nine months of last year – just over £1.6bn.

The car industry is now fighting for a softening of the EU’s 2035 target for banning the sale of new combustion engine cars, arguing that the public is still not prepared to make the switch in sufficient numbers, citing lack of infrastructure in southern and central Europe as part of the problem.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4229b89c6c0221b5358c92b2d2859dafcffd3dbe/340_0_4561_3648/master/4561.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6b4a5b4129b2c06a79a8aa5fa6aac752",N,,2025-10-27 13:10:31.876483

Geothermal will grow in California no matter what — of that, Darago said, she’s certain.","In the early 2000s, the owners of the Mammoth Pacific geothermal station proposed expanding the plant into an area just east of California’s Yosemite National Park. The project boasted on its website in 2004 that the potential new wells, which would be located in one of the state’s richest heat resources, had been ​“carefully chosen to reduce or avoid potential environmental impacts.”

By 2009, the company had produced a study on how the development could impact plant life. The power station had been running since the 1980s, so the decades of data on its safe operation seemed to bode well for a swift approval at a moment when, much like today, rising electricity demand and concern over climate change were converging to bolster development of carbon-free power. The prospects looked so good that, in 2010, geothermal giant Ormat Technologies bought the company that owned Mammoth. In 2013 — a decade after the expansion was first conceived — federal regulators gave the project the green light.

Yet that was just the start of Mammoth Pacific’s permitting saga.

An environmental group and local opponents quickly accused regulators of failing to properly consider how the geothermal project could release organic gases into the atmosphere and groundwater, and filed a lawsuit under the California Environmental Quality Act. The litigation took years to resolve. By the time Ormat finally completed the expansion in 2022, the so-called Casa Diablo IV project had been in the works for nearly two decades.

“People in the industry know it took 17 years to expand an existing facility,” said Joel Edwards, the cofounder and chief technology officer at the geothermal startup Zanskar. ​“And that’s the last facility that’s been built in California.”

Building a new geothermal plant from scratch on an undeveloped site, he said, would presumably ​“be an even bigger lift.”

A bill that California lawmakers passed almost unanimously last month promised to change that calculus for the geothermal industry. AB 527 would have provided geothermal developers with categorical exemptions to CEQA reviews, clearing the way for companies to carry out the most expensive part of the process — drilling wells to identify viable hot-rock resources — without the costly burden of lawsuits and ecological assessments the state’s landmark environmental law imposes. A companion bill, known as AB 531, designates geothermal energy under the special ​“environmental leadership development projects” status that state law already directs the California Energy Commission to grant to solar, wind, energy storage, and hydrogen facilities. Despite garnering more nay votes from lawmakers, that legislation is now law in California.

But, in a move that has mystified the industry, Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) vetoed AB 527. In his letter explaining the rejection, Newsom said the legislation would have required state regulators to ​“substantially increase fees on geothermal operators to implement the new requirements imposed by the bill.”

Of more than half a dozen industry executives and analysts that Canary Media spoke to, however, none believed that argument.

“Something doesn’t add up,” said Samuel Roland, a research fellow at the Foundation for American Innovation who has tracked the bill. ​“It was a political play for him.” The foundation is a right-leaning think tank that advocates for speeding up energy deployments.

While Roland said it’s difficult to determine exactly which groups may have persuaded the governor to block the legislation, ​“the only people who were objecting were environmentalists,” a dynamic that echoes the fight against Mammoth Pacific’s expansion.

“It does seem like it was a giveaway to environmental groups,” Roland said.

Izzy Gardon, a spokesperson for Newsom, declined to comment. ​“The Governor’s veto message speaks for itself,” he wrote in an email to Canary Media.

California dreamin’

California’s unique geology has made it the destination for the geothermal industry for decades. The Western Hemisphere’s first commercial geothermal power station opened in California in 1960. That plant — The Geysers geothermal complex, located in a valley of the Mayacamas Mountains north of the San Francisco Bay Area — remains the world’s largest electrical station powered by the planet’s heat.

The state has enormous untapped potential — and a growing need for electricity. California has shut down all but one of its nuclear power plants over the past few decades. In recent years, persistent drought has made the state’s hydroelectric stations less dependable. Solar generation has soared, and a growing fleet of batteries has helped steady the supply when sun-soaked days threaten to overwhelm the grid with electrons and dark nights send panels’ production plummeting. But the state remains reliant on natural gas and power imports from neighboring states to meet surging demand. To achieve its carbon-cutting goals and bring down electricity rates that are more than double that of nearby states, California needs to increase its supply of clean, firm generation.

Burning biomass, such as dry wood cleared from California’s forests to help prevent wildfires, could provide one option — but that still generates carbon dioxide, and the demand for wood might encourage logging of healthy trees. Despite the state’s reversal of its plan to shut down Diablo Canyon, its final atomic station, building new nuclear reactors is still banned in California. Hydropower is dogged by water scarcity. That makes geothermal a particularly attractive choice.

It’s not without some drawbacks. Conventional geothermal, which involves drilling down into underground reservoirs warmed by volcanic heat, is limited to easily accessible areas and comes with the challenge of maintaining the subterranean water source over time. Next-generation geothermal companies are rapidly advancing drilling techniques that the oil and gas industry perfected in recent years to go deeper and harvest heat from dry, hot rocks, vastly expanding the locations with potential to generate energy. In a seismically active state, that carries some risk since the version of next-generation geothermal that uses hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, technology to drill could trigger earthquakes.

But every energy source comes with challenges, and neighboring states such as Utah, Nevada, and New Mexico are aggressively pursuing next-generation geothermal projects.

In theory, the best place to develop those first-of-a-kind plants would be California, with its energy-affordability woes and status as a major global economy.

“Utah has low prices, and geothermal is still expensive,” said Thomas Hochman, director of infrastructure and energy policy at the Foundation for American Innovation. ​“If you want to bring geothermal down to cost parity with other technologies, you have to sell it to Californians. As a result, geothermal scaling runs through California.”

For the most part, however, developers are steering clear of the Golden State. Companies such as Fervo Energy, XGS Energy, and Sage Geosystems — three of the biggest next-generation startups — are based in Houston and are pursuing debut projects in Utah, New Mexico, and Texas itself. Zanskar, a developer using modern prospecting methods to tap conventional geothermal resources, is headquartered in Salt Lake City. States such as Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, and Oregon are ​“really exciting” as potential next areas for development, Edwards said.

“If California ever fixes CEQA,” he added, ​“it could be huge.”

The regulatory hurdles represent ​“the only real barrier” to geothermal taking off in the Golden State, said Wilson Ricks, a Princeton University researcher who focuses on geothermal.

“You can find projects pretty much all across the Western states but very few, if any, in California, despite it being the biggest potential market,” Ricks said.

“It’s stark. People are exploring projects in Texas, which has far, far worse-quality resources than the ones in California,” he added. ​“That’s because of the regulatory environment there. So the fact that regulatory barriers are going to remain in place doesn’t give me a lot of confidence that California’s going to be leaping ahead on geothermal anytime soon.”

In response to emailed questions, Fervo said it maintains leases near the Salton Sea region, an area with vast geothermal potential. But those parcels aren’t currently under development since the state’s permitting regime makes investing in drilling too risky.

“With the right legislative and permitting reforms, similar to those that were proposed in AB 527, the state could better position in-state resources for development and unlock the enormous economic benefits that come with local clean energy development,” said Sarah Harper, Fervo’s senior policy and regulatory affairs associate.

A revolution for geothermal?

Not everyone is so bearish. Ormat, the nation’s largest geothermal operator of conventional sites, said the fact that the vetoed bill passed in the Legislature without a single no vote, just a handful of abstentions, shows there’s political support for geothermal ​“like we haven’t seen in the past.”

“It’s like a revolution for geothermal,” said Marisol Collons, Ormat’s manager of communications and government affairs. ​“We’re still highly optimistic about the future and ready to kickstart all our next legislative sessions across the country.”

While Fervo lamented the small number of groups that dissented on the bill, the company said the fact that there were ​“more environmental groups in favor than there were ones opposed, or even neutral” left it feeling hopeful about the possibility of future legislation.

For XGS, a next-generation company whose technology forgoes fracking and minimizes its water usage by keeping the fluid for its operations contained in a closed tube, California remains ​“the highest-priority market.”

“We feel that California provides a unique combination from both a resource perspective and a market perspective,” said Lucy Darago, chief commercial officer at XGS. ​“It’s a high-demand market that really needs the attributes that geothermal brings.”

The key, she said, is time. Geothermal will grow in California no matter what — of that, Darago said, she’s certain. The question is whether that happens in time to stave off blackouts and slash emissions on the trajectory the state has set for its electrical system.

“The industry is going to happen. It will get there,” she said. ​“But if it’s going to get there on a timeline that’s meaningful for California’s resource-adequacy challenges and climate goals, we’ll need some of these changes.”",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/geothermal-field.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=810e4fdc520fa3d26f026ce210739298,N,,2025-10-27 13:09:07.053104

“Coal is complex — there’s no single right way to deal with it,” said Sidney Gathrid ’22, the study’s lead author.
“Instead of asking only why coal plants retire, we asked how we can make retirements happen faster — and in ways that are efficient and grounded in data,” Gathrid said.
“That’s a powerful approach to a geographically diverse and politically fragmented challenge.” Their analysis found that about 28% of coal plants without retirement plans are already highly vulnerable to closure — potential “quick wins” for policymakers and advocates.
“It’s flexible, transparent and reproducible — exactly what we need to make smarter, more strategic decisions about the energy transition.” Gathrid, now a co-founder of an AI and data start-up, Krv Analytics, based in Los Angeles, said the framework’s open-source design makes it especially valuable.","Even as coal power continues its steady decline in the United States, more than a hundred plants still have no retirement plans — a gap large enough to derail national climate goals. A new study led by UC Santa Barbara researchers offers a way forward, showing how targeted, data-driven approaches could help accelerate the transition.

Published in Nature Energy(link is external), the study tackles a critical question: if market forces have already driven many coal plants to close, why are so many still running? Despite years of decline, roughly 105 gigawatts of coal capacity — representing 114 plants — are still slated to operate through 2035, even though a complete phaseout by that date is widely considered essential for meeting U.S. net-zero emissions goals.

“Coal is complex — there’s no single right way to deal with it,” said Sidney Gathrid ’22, the study’s lead author. “Our goal was to build tools that reflect that complexity, so different actors can take on different facets of the problem. There’s no one straightforward path, and we wanted to do research that represented that reality.”

Working with Grace C. Wu, an assistant professor in the Environmental Studies Program and senior author on the paper, Gathrid and his team show that reaching those goals will require policymakers to move beyond age-based or one-size-fits-all approaches — and instead focus on the specific contexts that accelerate the retirement of certain coal plants.

To do that, the researchers — including Jeremy Wayland, Stuart Wayland ‘22, and Ranjit Deshmukh, an associate professor in the Environmental Studies Program and the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management — developed a new framework combining graph theory and topological data analysis to classify the entire U.S. coal fleet into eight distinct groups based on 68 technical, economic, environmental and socio-political factors. They also introduced a “contextual retirement vulnerability” score that measures how susceptible each plant is to early retirement by comparing it to facilities that have already announced closures.

The framework goes a step further by identifying “retirement archetypes” — patterns that explain why plants in each group are retiring. These range from regulatory and health-based drivers to unfavorable economics or political pressure, offering a clear set of levers that can be applied to similar facilities elsewhere.

“Instead of asking only why coal plants retire, we asked how we can make retirements happen faster — and in ways that are efficient and grounded in data,” Gathrid said. “Our framework helps policymakers and advocates identify where they can have the biggest impact.”

The study began as Gathrid’s senior thesis in UCSB’s Environmental Studies Program, supported by the campus’s Manalis Leadership Fellowship, sponsored by Howard and Lisa Wenger, and evolved into a years-long collaboration. Wu said the project’s scope and impact are rare for undergraduate research.

“This is Ph.D.-level work,” Wu said. “It’s extremely unusual for a project that started as a senior thesis to reach this level of sophistication and impact. What’s exciting is that this framework doesn’t just describe which plants might retire — it shows how to accelerate those retirements using drivers that worked with other retired or soon-to-be retired coal plants.”

Using their model, the team grouped 198 active U.S. coal plants into clusters such as High Health Impacts Plants, Expensive Plants, and Plants in Anti-Coal Regions, each linked to specific vulnerabilities that can be targeted with policy or advocacy. For example, plants associated with high asthma rates and poor air quality could be prioritized through public-health campaigns and environmental enforcement, while those struggling financially might respond more effectively to economic incentives or market-based mechanisms.

One striking example is Belews Creek in North Carolina — a nearly 50-year-old, 2.49-gigawatt coal plant that the study categorizes as both highly vulnerable to retirement and part of Group 0: Fuel Blend Plants. The facility can burn up to 50% natural gas, yet remains one of the nation’s top particulate polluters, ranking 26th out of 198 for fine particle emissions. Financially, it’s among the most unprofitable plants in the country, carrying roughly $46 million in debt as of 2020.

Belews Creek is also located in a state seeing rapid growth in solar development and the implementation of coal debt securitization policies designed to help utilities transition away from uneconomic fossil assets. “Given the drivers for retirements in this group,” the authors noted, “advocates can leverage state and utility clean energy targets.” There were even preliminary discussions about replacing Belews Creek with a small modular nuclear reactor, but the plant’s owner, Duke Energy, has since postponed its retirement — underscoring the financial and operational complexities that the UCSB framework aims to untangle.

“We can simplify nearly 200 plants into clear groups and pair each with evidence-based strategies,” Wu said. “That’s a powerful approach to a geographically diverse and politically fragmented challenge.”

Their analysis found that about 28% of coal plants without retirement plans are already highly vulnerable to closure — potential “quick wins” for policymakers and advocates. But it also revealed that the least vulnerable plants are spread across several groups, underscoring the need for a diverse set of strategies to address the most persistent facilities.

The implications extend beyond coal. Because the model captures the multi-dimensional forces that shape real-world decisions — economics, politics, health and grid reliability — it could be adapted to other complex decarbonization challenges.

Wu, whose research focuses on sustainable energy transition planning, said the framework bridges mathematical and applied environmental science in a way that could transform how analysts and decision-makers approach energy policy.

“This work takes state-of-the-art mathematical tools and puts them into the practitioner’s toolbox,” she said. “It’s flexible, transparent and reproducible — exactly what we need to make smarter, more strategic decisions about the energy transition.”

Gathrid, now a co-founder of an AI and data start-up, Krv Analytics, based in Los Angeles, said the framework’s open-source design makes it especially valuable.

“The methods we developed are meant to be used,” he said. “Whether you’re working on coal, renewables or industrial emissions, the idea is the same — use the data you have to see where progress can happen first, and why.”",https://news.ucsb.edu/sites/default/files/2025-10/coal-opt.jpg,N,,2025-10-27 13:09:51.841251

Overall, customers are set to see a nearly $90 billion hike in their utility bills through 2028, the analysis finds. The increases are affecting more than 107 million electric customers and more than 46 million natural gas customers across 49 states and Washington, D.C.

These spikes are being driven by a combination of increasing demand from artificial intelligence (AI) data centers, aging electric grids, extreme weather, higher natural gas prices, and the Trump administration’s irrational policy assault on new clean energy deployment.

Instead of addressing rising utility costs, the Trump administration has canceled projects for new energy supply, taken away support for grid resilience, issued massive new tariffs that worsen supply chain concerns, and increased consumer costs by forcing expensive coal plants to run past their scheduled retirements.

“Utility customers are suffering because of surging electricity bills, but the Trump administration is making it worse,” said Amanda Levin, director of policy analysis at the NRDC and co-author of the analysis. “While it keeps trying to prop up the struggling and expensive energy of the past century, it’s harming the fastest and cheapest sources of power that are ready to join the grid today. What a shame.”

The Trump administration’s attacks on clean energy and giveaways for the fossil fuel industry, coupled with the effects of rolling back clean energy tax credits, mean that American households could spend upward of $430 more per year on their energy bills within the next decade.

“Millions of Americans are struggling with higher utility bills. But the Trump administration insists on propping up the fossil fuel industry and taking away solutions that help lower costs for Americans,” said Lucero Marquez, associate director of federal climate policy at CAP and co-author of the analysis. “That means we will continue to see utility bills rise and have no relief for the Americans that need it.”

The updated tracker analyzed the rates of 210 utilities based on examination of online filings by the companies and records of decisions in state public utilities commission dockets. An earlier analysis, released in September, examined rates from 102 utilities.

Overall, the analysis finds that utilities around the country are raising costs on customers by $89.9 billion through 2028. About $71.2 billion of that increase is electric and $18.6 billion is natural gas.

""By joining forces with Essential, the combined company’s enhanced scale and operational efficiency will support continued investment in our critical infrastructure,"" said American Water CEO John Griffith, who will head the combined company.

Meanwhile, American Water said it was planning to review strategic alternatives for its non-water and non-wastewater businesses upon closure of the deal.

The merger will add to American Water’s earnings per share in the first year following the deal’s close. American Water expects to maintain its forecast of long-term earnings per share growth between 7% to 9%.

Essential Utilities CEO Christopher Franklin will serve as executive vice chair of the board.

MERCK CONTINUES U.S. INVESTMENT TOUR

Global pharmaceutical giant Merck has officially launched the construction of a new $3 billion manufacturing facility in Virginia. The new 400,000 sq. ft. plant will join operations at the company’s 85-year-old site in Elkton, enhancing space for active pharmaceutical ingredient and drug product investments to support small molecule manufacturing and testing. This project comes as another step in Merck’s greater $70 billion commitment to its U.S. manufacturing operations, which saw new production facility investments in North Carolina, Delaware and Kansas earlier this year. “This investment helps advance our goal of providing new, innovative treatment options for people facing serious health challenges in the U.S. and around the world,” said Merck Chair and CEO Robert M. Davis. The construction phase of the new Elkton facility will create up to 8,000 jobs and and plant will create 500 direct roles once operational. Merck’s press release notes that the company additionally plans to invest $3 billion into future biologics and small molecule facilities, as well as a fresh $3.5 upgrade to its Rahway, New Jersey, HQ.

PITTSBURGH CAPTURES ENERGY INNOVATION

A $352.9 million investment decision will move Eos Energy Enterprises’ current New Jersey headquarters out of Edison and into Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, by late 2026. The zinc-based battery energy storage systems manufacturer selected a 40,000-sq.-ft. office space at Nova Place in the city’s North Shore neighborhood, a strategic location to not only tap into expertise at local universities like Carnegie Mellon University, but to support the company’s growing operations. Eos Energy will further cement roots in Allegheny County with the expansion of its manufacturing capabilities, which includes leasing a 430,000-sq.-ft. facility in Marshall Township to integrate additional production lines. The company currently occupies two production plants in Turtle Creek with 265 employees between the two, although this expansion project will bring an influx of 735 new jobs to the region. “What we are announcing today is built upon a strong industrial history, combined with a world class university ecosystem,” said Eos Energy CEO Joe Mastrangelo. “Pennsylvania is positioning itself at the forefront of America’s energy transition — enabling us to bring America’s battery to scale.”

In a statement obtained by WTHR, Braun said, “I am calling a special legislative session to protect Hoosiers from efforts in other States that seek to diminish their voice in Washington and ensure their representation in Congress is fair.”

Discussion has increased ahead of the special session regarding the potential impact of redistricting on Indiana’s two Democratic seats in the U.S. House of Representatives. Reports from FOX59 indicate that federal Republicans are supporting the proposed map changes. However, there may not yet be enough votes to approve the redistricting, as Niki Kelly, editor of the Indiana Capital Chronicle, noted uncertainty about the state senate vote count. Braun stated that the votes are ""getting very close.""

The session will also cover compliance with new federal tax provisions outlined in the ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act,"" which currently impact state tax filings.

Indiana Democrats have opposed the redistricting efforts, with some raising concerns about the governor's conduct. Additionally, Indiana Democratic Party Chair Karen Tallian commented on Braun's position in a statement to WTHR, saying, ""At best, Braun has been brow-beaten, changed his mind, and finally kissed the … ring … of the man who would be King.""

Citizens from different political backgrounds have shared their views on the redistricting effort. A poll by Independent Indiana found that 53% of voters opposed the plans, while 34% supported them. The state’s current maps, drawn four years ago using a transparent process, may be revised as lawmakers review a new map developed with input from political operatives in Washington, D.C.

Biodiesel In addition to slower growth in renewable diesel production capacity, biodiesel production capacity decreased slightly.

A deceleration in production capacity in our category renewable diesel and other biofuels accounted for most of the slowdown in growth. Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), renewable naphtha, and renewable propane make up virtually all of the other biofuels.

Renewable diesel and other biofuels

Renewable diesel and other biofuels production capacity increased just 391 million gallons per year (gal/y) in 2024, less than one-third of the growth observed in 2022 and 2023. In 2024, only two capacity additions came online, both in California: Phillips 66’s conversion of its Rodeo refinery to exclusively produce biofuels and the new Renewable Fuels LLC plant in Bakersfield.

With the completed conversion, the Rodeo plant has a capacity of 767 million gal/y, up from 180 million gal/y in last year’s report. This increase makes it the second-largest renewable diesel plant in the United States, behind Diamond Green Diesel’s 982-million-gal/y plant in Norco, Louisiana.

U.S. capacity growth from the Rodeo expansion and the 138-million-gal/y Bakersfield plant was partially offset by the loss of capacity at four facilities. Monroe Energy and Chevron stopped co-processing renewable diesel at their Trainer, Pennsylvania, and El Segundo, California, refineries, respectively. Vertex Energy and Jaxon Energy closed plants in Mobile, Alabama, and Jackson, Mississippi, respectively.

The loss of renewable diesel capacity at four facilities reflects changes to biofuel margins and petroleum refining margins since 2020. Low refinery margins and rising biofuel credit values in 2020 and 2021 prompted a wave of renewable diesel capacity announcements. As more of those plants started operations, biofuel production began exceeding target volumes, and biofuel credit values and margins decreased in 2023. At the same time, petroleum refinery margins were much stronger than their 2020 lows, resulting in a slowdown in investments to expand renewable diesel capacity for the upcoming years.

A notable shift in 2024 was the increased focus on SAF. SAF is an alternative to petroleum jet fuel that we capture in our other biofuels category. Other biofuels includes SAF, renewable heating oil, renewable naphtha, renewable propane, renewable gasoline, and other emerging biofuels. We combine other biofuels with renewable diesel capacity because other biofuels are mostly produced at renewable diesel plants as byproducts or, often in the case of SAF, in place of renewable diesel. Following the completion of conversion projects in 2024, Phillips 66’s Rodeo plant can shift about 150 million gal/y of its renewable diesel production capacity to SAF, and Diamond Green Diesel can shift about 235 million gal/y to SAF.

Biodiesel

In addition to slower growth in renewable diesel production capacity, biodiesel production capacity decreased slightly. In 2024, eight biodiesel plants closed due to poor margins, resulting in a loss of about 100 million gal/y of production capacity.

Fuel ethanol

Unlike renewable diesel and biodiesel, U.S. fuel ethanol production capacity increased more in 2024 than in previous years. Fuel ethanol accounts for 73% of all biofuels production capacity, with a total of almost 18.5 billion gallons of capacity per year. Most of this production is concentrated in Midwest states, where corn is produced for feedstock. Because U.S. fuel ethanol consumption has been somewhat flat in recent years, the increased capacity is mostly contributing to growing exports of ethanol.",https://www.ajot.com/images/uploads/article/_large/EIA_chart_12_13.jpg,N,,2025-10-27 12:10:32.079556

In 2005, the city's voters approved a divorce from Progress Energy, which later merged with Duke Energy.
""If we look at Winter Park, your city's going to be able to reinvest into itself,"" he said at the September meeting.
“During Milton, Helene, and Debbie, Duke Energy was able to bring in 27,000 resources from across the country.
Research shows Duke Energy has the highest average residential rates in the state, followed by Tampa Electric.","St. Petersburg and Clearwater are considering doing something very few Florida cities have done recently: unplug from the electric company.

If either city decides to disconnect from Duke Energy, here's a little advice from someone who knows something about it.

“I would tell them to expect a big fight,” said Randy Knight, the city manager of Winter Park, just outside of Orlando.

In 2005, the city's voters approved a divorce from Progress Energy, which later merged with Duke Energy.

ALSO READ: Tampa Electric and Duke are increasing their electric rates starting in March

“From a public relations standpoint, they will be going around the community telling everybody they don't know what they're doing,” he said. “They've never run an electric utility.”

""The joke in Winter Park at the time was we would have five guys in a pickup truck trying to restore power,"" Knight said. ""That's what they were telling people, and so they will attempt to get elections overturned to where more favorable people will be in office that would support a new franchise. So that's what I would expect.""

Knight added his city was given an estimated price tag of $106 million from Progress Energy. After prolonged battles in court, it ended up costing about $43 million, including the powerlines and poles. Most of the money paid for the utility’s lost business and investment. Winter Park paid another $30 million in legal fees.

Switch has a positive effect

But voters approved a referendum by 69% and the city's utility bills are now 28% lower than Dukes'. The city has used the profits it makes to bury 81% of its power lines, meaning fewer outages during major storms.

“I will tell you that when the last hurricanes came through last year, all the utilities around us had outages for a few days,” Knight said. “We had everybody back up the same day the storm left the city.”

Knight said there's even an industry manual out — a kind of a how-to book that companies can use to fight municipalities looking to get off the utility grid. The 70-page manual from the Edison Electric Institute includes ways to prevent takeovers at the legislative level and at the ballot box.

“They fought us every step of the way,” Knight said. “We were, of course, the first one in Florida to do this. And so they first filed a lawsuit challenging whether we really had the right to purchase.”

Winter Park bought the electric distribution system in the city limits from Duke and buys power on the open market through long-term contracts. Knight said they buy the bulk of the power through the Florida Municipal Power Association, but had to buy energy through Duke after they bought the system.

""We enter into seven- to 10-year contracts to buy power,"" he said, ""And then it comes across the transmission lines, in our case, owned by Duke Energy, because they're all around us.""

The Orlando-based Association describes itself as a wholesale power agency owned by municipal electric utilities in Florida. It serves the 33 municipal electric utilities located across the state.

In September, Clearwater's City Council voted unanimously to study creating its own municipal electric utility to replace Duke.

During that meeting, residents were in favor of the change. Shane Marr said the Charlotte, North Carolina-based utility charges higher rates to pay its investors.

“Duke has fleeced the Clearwater community for many decades,” he told council members. “People across the community have struggled to pay the bonuses of shareholders who have no regard for their well-being.”

ALSO READ: Electricity prices are climbing more than twice as fast as inflation

Councilman Ryan Cotton noted that Winter Park is on track to bury all their power lines underground by 2030.

""If we look at Winter Park, your city's going to be able to reinvest into itself,"" he said at the September meeting. ""So not only are you going to be getting upfront savings that still continue through the 30-year (contract) generationally, but you will also get the reinvestment of undergrounding service lines just like Winter Park is doing.""

An independent study commissioned by NewGen Strategies and Solutions predicts that electric bills would become up to 18% lower than Duke Energy's rates.

City council members agreed to go forward with a more detailed feasibility study. The city's 30-year agreement with Duke ends in December.

Duke states its case

Duke spokeswoman Ana Gibbs says they're the most reliable source of electricity for the region — especially right after hurricanes.

“During Milton, Helene, and Debbie, Duke Energy was able to bring in 27,000 resources from across the country. That means crews came in from Colorado, California, and even Canada, and we were able to restore more than 2 million customer outages,” Gibbs said.

""In addition to that, our advanced self-healing technology was able to reroute power and avoid more than 325 million minutes of outages. And what that means was the lights were able to stay on during those 325 million minutes, when customers needed the lights on the most. The investments we've made to upgrade the grid was able to avoid outage minutes during those storms, and that's really important to our customers.""

Duke added that it’ll fight moves by the city to disconnect. It's study showed a transition could cost Clearwater up to $1 billion.

The city plans to get its own estimate after the new study is complete.

Research shows Duke Energy has the highest average residential rates in the state, followed by Tampa Electric. Winter Park had one of the cheapest rates.

It's been done before

Many Florida cities have run their own electric services for decades, including Jacksonville, Orlando, Gainesville, Kissimmee, and Alachua.

In Polk County, Lakeland Electric has operated as a public power utility since 1904. Bartow has had its own electric utility since the early 1900s.

St. Petersburg is also considering creating its own utility. Its 30-year contract with Duke ends in August.

Council member Corey Givens Jr. said during a meeting that he knows the city could end up in litigation for years. But he said he has personally felt the pinch of high prices.

“$450 was my bill yesterday, the highest bill that I have ever received. And I was disgusted because I felt what my constituents are feeling,” he said. “They want help now.”

But Mayor Ken Welch has already discussed a new decade-long agreement with the company.

There have also been arguments to stay with established utilities. In 2018, Vero Beach voters agreed to sell their century-old, debt-laden municipal utility to Florida Power and Light.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d4bad71/2147483647/strip/true/crop/968x508+0+69/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F3c%2Fe1%2Fe9f228ca4f0b901b1b717b855970%2Fwinter-park-electric.png,N,,2025-10-27 12:10:35.421553

The Economic Backbone Campbell Provides Campbell is more than a power plant.
Direct Jobs: Campbell directly employs about 300 highly skilled workers — operators, engineers, mechanics, and electricians.
Without Campbell, Michigan becomes far more exposed to that volatility.
It can continue to provide Michigan with reliable baseload power, economic stability, and energy security while complementing new technologies.","Picture this: it’s one of the coldest nights of a Michigan winter. The wind howls off Lake Michigan, the snow piles high, and the temperature plunges well below zero. Families across the state turn up their thermostats, hospitals lean on electric heating to protect patients, and factories fight to keep machinery from freezing. But the wind has gone calm, leaving turbines idle. The sun has set, leaving solar panels dark. Natural gas pipelines, stressed by extreme cold, are constrained or frozen. And there are no coal plants like J.H. Campbell left to carry the load.

In that moment, the lights flicker, the furnaces cut off, and millions of Michiganders realize what policymakers never accounted for: you cannot run a modern state on promises and press releases. You need real, on-demand power. You need coal.

That’s not a distant scenario. It’s a real and growing risk if Campbell is shut down early. For over 60 years, this plant has supplied Michigan with 1,400 megawatts of reliable, fuel-secure electricity. It has kept homes warm through every polar vortex and heatwave. It has supported hundreds of good jobs and poured millions into schools, first responders, and local services. To shutter Campbell prematurely is to gamble with Michigan’s reliability, affordability, and prosperity.

This is not progress. It is a deliberate weakening of America’s energy foundation at the very moment we need it most.

A Reliable Grid Demands Real Power

Coal has always been America’s insurance policy against the unpredictable. When the weather doesn’t cooperate, when gas prices spike, when demand surges — coal is the steady hand that keeps the grid from collapsing.

Campbell is part of that safety net. With three generating units, it delivers more than 1,400 megawatts of baseload electricity — enough to power 800,000 average sized homes. It does so with on-site fuel that can be stored and dispatched on demand, regardless of the weather. That makes it unique in today’s fragile energy mix.

Michigan’s grid operator, MISO, has already warned of capacity shortfalls during periods of peak demand. That’s before Campbell is removed from the system. If it closes, the state becomes even more vulnerable to blackouts during extreme heat and cold. Blackouts aren’t just inconvenient. They shut down hospitals, freeze water pipes, halt production lines, and put lives in danger.

We’ve seen what happens when that safety net is pulled away. During Winter Storm Uri in 2021, Texas lost both renewables and large portions of its natural gas fleet. Millions of Texans shivered in the dark, 210 Texans died and Texas incurred an estimated $130 billion in economic losses—serious losses to consider for one State during one storm. Coal units that remained online provided critical backup. In the Midwest, every polar vortex tells the same story: coal is the last line of defense when demand surges and other fuels fail.

Supporters of Campbell’s closure argue that renewables and imports can “fill the gap.” But wind and solar don’t generate at will, and imports depend on neighboring states having excess power to sell — a dangerous gamble when cold snaps grip the entire region.

The reality is simple: Campbell is not outdated. It is essential. Without it, Michigan risks power shortages, higher costs, and a less resilient grid.

The Economic Backbone Campbell Provides

Campbell is more than a power plant. It’s an economic engine that supports jobs, families, and communities across Michigan. Its annual impact is measured not only in megawatts, but in paychecks, tax dollars, and local investment.

Direct Jobs: Campbell directly employs about 300 highly skilled workers — operators, engineers, mechanics, and electricians. These are family-sustaining careers with good wages, healthcare, and pensions.

Indirect Jobs: More than 1,000 additional jobs are tied to Campbell through coal mining, rail and trucking, equipment suppliers, contractors, and local businesses that serve employees and their families.

Payroll & Benefits: Together, these jobs deliver an estimated $35–40 million annually in wages and benefits into the Michigan economy. Those dollars ripple through local diners, grocery stores, car dealerships, and small businesses.

Tax Contributions: Campbell contributes tens of millions of dollars every year in state and local taxes. That money funds schools, fire departments, police forces, and infrastructure in Ottawa County and beyond. Without Campbell, those tax dollars vanish — forcing higher taxes elsewhere or cuts to vital services.

Affordable Power Value: Campbell’s 1,400 megawatts of baseload generation insulate Michigan families and businesses from the wild price swings of natural gas. In 2022, when gas prices spiked, coal kept electricity bills from skyrocketing even higher. Without Campbell, Michigan becomes far more exposed to that volatility.

This economic profile isn’t hypothetical. It’s measurable, it’s real, and it would be impossible to replace with the handful of temporary construction jobs offered by intermittent renewable projects. Campbell sustains communities year after year. Closing it prematurely tears that foundation away.

What We Stand to Lose

If Campbell closes ahead of schedule, here is the reality Michigan will face:

Higher Costs: Michigan already has some of the highest power rates in the Midwest. Removing a low-cost baseload provider like Campbell guarantees higher bills.

Job Losses: Hundreds of direct plant jobs and more than a thousand supply-chain jobs disappear, with no comparable replacements.

Community Harm: Local governments lose millions in tax revenue, cutting funding for schools, emergency services, and infrastructure.

Weaker Reliability: Blackouts and brownouts become more likely during peak demand, threatening safety and economic competitiveness.

Eroded Energy Security: Without Campbell’s fuel-secure stockpiles, Michigan becomes more dependent on weather-based renewables and volatile natural gas.

This is not a “just transition.” It’s a forced disruption that puts ideology over reality and punishes the very families and communities that have powered Michigan for generations.

A Smarter Path Forward

America needs an all that works energy strategy. Coal remains the backbone of reliable, affordable, fuel-secure electricity. Rather than tearing down what works, policymakers should invest in modernizing the coal fleet.

Campbell doesn’t need to be sacrificed. It can continue to provide Michigan with reliable baseload power, economic stability, and energy security while complementing new technologies. What we need is balance, not blind adherence to political talking points.

Conclusion

Imagine again that bitterly cold Michigan night — the wind calm, the sun down, the gas lines strained. Without Campbell, without coal, millions would be left in the dark. That is not an abstract risk. It is the direct consequence of energy policies that dismiss coal’s value while offering no real replacement.

The J.H. Campbell plant has served Michigan faithfully for six decades. It supports thousands of jobs, powers over a million homes, funds local schools and first responders, and provides a bedrock of reliability the grid cannot do without. Shutting it down early is not progress. It is a reckless gamble with Michigan’s economy, its families, and its future.

If we care about affordable power, about strong communities, about American energy independence, then we must keep Campbell online. Michigan’s future — and America’s strength — depend on it.

The collaboration aims to connect global knowledge across regions to support the clean energy transition across ADB’s developing member countries and builds on shared commitments to inclusive, sustainable growth and country-led development.

Through this initiative, U-M and WDI will work collaboratively with ADB on a wide range of projects across the Asian region, including in clean energy and e-mobility, climate and health, water, food security, and biodiversity. Experts from U-M and WDI will serve as academic research partners and collaborators to ADB’s teams and their counterparts in the bank’s developing member countries, ranging from government officials to stakeholders across industry and academia. Established in 1966 and based in Manila, ADB today has 68 member countries, 49 of which are from the Asia region.

“This collaboration will help us tap into Michigan’s expertise and access global innovation to create more opportunities to advance inclusive and sustainable development in the region,” said Scott Morris, vice president of the Asian Development Bank. “By joining forces with the University of Michigan and the William Davidson Institute, ADB is reinforcing our commitment to empowering communities with knowledge, skills and access to solutions that will build resilience, drive economic opportunity, and shape a more prosperous future for Asia and the Pacific.”​

The partners will commission actionable research, engage in projects in ADB member countries, facilitate regional roundtable discussions and host cross-learning activities—both in Asia and in Michigan—allowing for knowledge sharing and collaboration among policymakers and practitioners from ADB member countries and Michigan-based experts and decision makers.

“This partnership underscores the University of Michigan’s commitment to global collaboration in addressing the challenges and opportunities presented by the energy transition and the drive for more sustainable development,” said Jonathan Overpeck, dean of SEAS. “By connecting U-M’s leadership in workforce and technology innovation and research with deep regional and local expertise across Asia, we can help advance equitable, resilient development. No one nation or region has all the answers, so the benefits of us learning from and with one another are very exciting. Partnerships focused on Asia provide the opportunity for growing our research and innovation impact in society not just at home, but across the globe. The climate crisis is a global problem that requires global solutions.”

SEAS brings unparalleled strength in the interdisciplinary education, research and innovation that is needed to accelerate the energy transition and create a more resilient and sustainable planet. Work across campus, with WDI and ADB, creates opportunities for partnerships between universities and other stakeholders in Asia to support a common goal of developing the leaders of tomorrow in a region that has the largest greenhouse gas emissions and is facing the most devastating impacts of the climate crisis. The partners will continue to define and implement joint initiatives through mechanisms such as knowledge sharing, convenings, study tours, training programs, student internships and access to shared publications.

Recognizing the critical link between human capital and sustainable growth, the collaboration will also promote training and entrepreneurship to connect innovators from ADB member countries with Michigan’s research institutions and entrepreneurship ecosystems and open opportunities for Michigan ventures to access Asian markets. WDI will lead efforts to foster cross-regional learning, business opportunities, technical training and market access.

“This agreement reflects WDI’s deep belief that innovation and thriving ventures are central to building healthier, more sustainable futures,” said Wendy Taylor, president and CEO of WDI. “By working alongside the University of Michigan and the Asian Development Bank, we’re creating pathways for inclusive economic growth that engage communities, strengthen innovation ecosystems and accelerate progress toward a clean energy future—from Detroit to Manila.”

The partnership also aims to accelerate e-mobility development by working with key stakeholders to support electric vehicle adoption, supply chain innovation and workforce development, building on work to date. In July, with support from ADB, WDI released the report “Driving a just transition to e-mobility in the Philippines” with research findings based on its collaboration with ADB and the Apl.de.Ap Foundation International. In addition to extensive market research, WDI’s engagement in the project involved field work in the Philippines and engagement via focus group discussions, interviews, and company and university site visits. While the research primarily focuses on the Philippines, the team also examined e-mobility progress in other countries in Southeast Asia, particularly in the policy realm, to contextualize the findings.

The partnership can also capitalize on learning from other regions. WDI’s Energy and Mobility team previously partnered with the State of Chihuahua, Mexico, a region with a heavily automotive and supplier manufacturing base, increasingly looking to transition toward an e-mobility future. The collaboration resulted in the Chihuahua Charging Forward project. In that initiative and related work, WDI’s Energy & Mobility team partnered with local economic development organizations, companies, researchers and innovators along the EV value chain.

Two weeks later, JPMC said the fund’s first initiative will involve a $75 million investment to acquire a 3% equity interest in Idaho mining company Perpetua Resources and its Stibnite Mine, which stands to become a key supplier of the critical mineral antimony in the years to come. It is a key investment in a mining industry whose role in U.S. national security has assumed elevated status in recent months.

""It has become painfully clear that the United States has allowed itself to become too reliant on unreliable sources of critical minerals, products and manufacturing – all of which are essential for our national security,"" JPMC Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said in a release. The company’s plan, called the Security and Resiliency Initiative, will target four key categories: Supply chain and advanced manufacturing, defense and aerospace, energy independence and resilience, and frontier and strategic technologies.

Highlighting Mining’s Key National Security Role

Perpetua Resources and the Stibnite Mine fit neatly into every one of those categories. As I first detailed here in 2021, antimony, though little known to most people, is a key component in a vast variety of products that are central to our modern way of life, including smart phones and other gadgets, bullets, major military weapons systems, and most forms of renewable energy.

Put simply, there can be no energy transition without ready and affordable supplies of this key mineral. That thick, heavy glass used in solar panels? It’s made with antimony. Those 300- to 700-foot-tall windmills that produce electricity when the weather’s good? Made with antimony. Antimony is a key element in the manufacture of lithium-ion batteries, and even more crucial is the fact that it is integral to the development of the next-generation battery technologies that could hold the key to truly scalable energy storage for wind and solar power.

""This is all about putting America first again relative to the supply chain, in this case for critical minerals,"" said Jon Cherry, Perpetua’s CEO. JPMC obviously agrees, and it is not alone in that assessment.

The Pentagon considers the Stibnite mine important enough to national security that it sent a representative, Major General John T. Reim, to participate in the ribbon cutting ceremony when the mine was formally re-opened on September 19, following an arduous 15-year-long permitting process. Speaking to an audience of local, state, and company officials, Reim said the restart of its operations puts the Pentagon “one step closer to establishing a complete domestic supply chain,” for its antimony needs.

Mining For Gold, Antimony, And More

In addition to the infusion of $75 million from JPM, Perpetua also announced a $180 million investment into its operations on Monday by Canada-based Agnico Eagle Mines Limited, the world’s second-biggest gold producer. As with JPM’s deal, the up-front investment is in Perpetua common stock, and comes with warrants to buy additional shares at discounted prices over the coming three years.

“The Stibnite Gold Project is an excellent opportunity in a premier mining jurisdiction. Our investment in Perpetua aligns with Agnico Eagle’s commitment to disciplined and strategic investments through emerging and high-quality opportunities and provides measured exposure to one of the highest-grade open-pit gold deposits in the United States, with significant exploration upside,” said Ammar Al-Joundi, President and Chief Executive Officer of Agnico Eagle.

The Stibnite Mine is an obvious fit for Agnico Eagle and its prominence in the gold industry, given that the mine was originally established in 1927 as a gold mining operation. But early exploration quickly identified major stores of silver and antimony inside the targeted rock. Long a key player in ensuring U.S. national security, this single mine supplied 90% of America’s antimony needs throughout the war effort of World War II. Today, the Stibnite Mine is considered one of the largest resources of antimony outside of the control of China, Russia and their allies. In an email, a Perpetua spokesperson indicated that, in addition to is capital infusion, the mining operation also stands to benefit from Anglico Eagle’s deep technical expertise.

Even though Rivian stock is up this year, I don't think overall momentum is going to last if we do see U.S. demand for electric vehicles weaken in the short term.","This is a loaded question, and the answer isn't an exact science. Rivian Automotive (RIVN +1.54%) held some serious traction in 2022 and 2023, but stalled out in 2024 -- it dropped from 167% revenue growth to 12%. So what happened? And what's Rivian to do?

As I see it, Rivian faces two major challenges over the next three years: Getting more affordable car models to market, and handling the loss of the tax credits that electric vehicle (EV) companies enjoyed.

Other automakers have been sounding the alarm on EV demand. Stellantis (STLA +1.61%), maker of the popular RAM pickup trucks, cancelled its REV pickup due to weakening North American demand. General Motors announced last week that it will be cutting back its EV production due to the loss of tax credits, and subsequent weaker demand.

These are clear indicators of a potentially major problem for a company attempting to solely sell electric SUVs and trucks in the United States.

An expensive stock

Rivian stock has lost 90% of its value since going public. Even after that decline, the company remains at over $16 billion in market value, but is losing billions annually and is seeing slower top-line growth.

One of the often overlooked, but very important things to keep in mind here is the actual valuation trends for auto stocks. The established players, most of which all have their own EV lineups, trade at around 10 times earnings. A few might trade slightly higher, such as Ford Motor Company, which trades at 15 times earnings.

But as a whole, investors just aren't overly enthused about giving high valuations to most car stocks. Admittedly there's a differentiation between the traditional names and the new guys. These new players are getting traded on different metrics, such as price-to-sales, speculation, and so on, but I don't see them maintaining this momentum for the long term.

After a certain point, earnings are what matter, and EV companies like Rivian and Tesla are all going to answer to it eventually. Because of that, I see eventual downward pressure on the valuations given to names like Rivian.

Back to gross losses

Last quarter, gross results shifted back to losses of $206 million after two quarters of gross profits. In all, Rivian is reporting net losses of billions annually, with a loss of $4.75 billion last year. Given that its working on adding new and more affordable models, expenses don't seem likely to lessen in the coming months.

Perhaps the one big differentiator here is the partnership, and $1 billion in equity gained from Volkswagen back in July. This clear partnership is the redeeming indicator for this stock. Volkwagen is a global company, and a partnership with it has some significant potential in terms of Rivian being able to provide its software for use.

This is just a piece of the $5.8 billion agreement between the two companies. Still, this is a long path forward, and as stated, without tax credits for EVs, I think the industry will struggle to create the same momentum it has enjoyed in the United States, which is one of the prime auto markets.

The next three years

When trying to figure out Rivian's potential over the next three years, one has to consider the costs and time it'll take for Rivian to ramp up its cheaper models, as well as how it's going to manage what could become a tougher market. In its most recent quarter, production, deliveries, and total auto revenues were down year over year. Total revenue expanded thanks to increased software revenue, which reached $376 million last quarter.

Rivian is working to bring lower-priced options to market, such as the R2 SUV, which will theoretically help attract more customers to the table, but it is still priced at $45,000. That's not so cheap when you consider the number of traditional options available, like cars that you don't need to charge, and that have better maintenance and repair infrastructure.

While electric vehicles certainly have their place, the current environment doesn't seem primed to create huge increases in demand for EVs right now. As long as the Trump administration is in the White House, it doesn't seem likely that tax credits for EVs are coming back.

Because of that, the next three years don't seem overly bullish for automakers that only produce electric vehicles. Even though Rivian stock is up this year, I don't think overall momentum is going to last if we do see U.S. demand for electric vehicles weaken in the short term.",https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/839214/car-batteries.jpg,N,,2025-10-27 10:18:18.983722

The bottom line is that we need more people working in renewables to deliver the projects ahead of us. The good news is that many of the skills we need already exist - in oil & gas, mining, the armed forces, and trades. Our job is to connect that talent with the huge opportunity we have in our sector. The skills gap is most visible in technical roles. In Europe, wind alone supports 370,000 jobs and is projected to hit 600,000 by 2030. Two-thirds of those won’t require a university degree. For me, one of the most powerful stories of the energy transition is the creation of long-term, high-quality careers. To make that a reality, we need to attract talent from all walks of life by building meaningful roles in the regions where renewables are developed - often far from capital cities. These careers not only power the transition but also strengthen local economies and shape the next generation of clean energy professionals.

Rare earths are critical for a variety of high-tech products, including for electric vehicles and weapons systems like submarines and fighter jets. And it’s amidst all that geopolitical tension that a first-of-its-kind heavy rare earth separation facility has been announced in Louisiana.

That torque you feel after hitting the accelerator of an electric car happens because of special magnets used in motors.

“And those magnets, to operate at the temperature they need to, it's based on these heavy rare earths, the dysprosium and terbium,” said Hugh Broadhurst with Aclara Resources, the company opening the new facility that will make dysprosium and terbium oxides through a unique process. It involves separating ionic clay that the company will source from its new mines in Chile and Brazil.

“What our customers need is a robust supply chain that is separated from the geopolitical issues that are going on today,” Broadhurst said.

As the U.S. develops its rare earths value chains, this new facility — dedicated to ionic clay separation — is a milestone, per Evelyn Wang, vice president for energy and climate at MIT.

(The Center Square) – U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, has reintroduced yet another bill to support the U.S. oil and natural gas industry.

Cruz on Monday reintroduced the Natural Gas Export Expansion Act, which would expedite the federal approval process for exporting liquefied natural gas (LNG). He first introduced it in 2021 and again in 2023 as the Biden administration took more than 200 actions against the industry, including halting permits and banning LNG exports.

“Increasing U.S. energy exports is good for America, and there is no bigger energy producer than the state of Texas,” Cruz told The Center Square. The legislation he has proposed now for the third time “expedites permits for LNG exporters to ensure that Texas-produced gas can be sent to our allies around the world. It will enhance American energy dominance, create jobs, and drive investment.”

He did so as the industry in his home state continues to break multiple production and methane emissions reduction records, The Center Square first reported.

The U.S. became a net exporter of natural gas in 2017 for the first time since 1957, led by Texas and Louisiana “primarily because of increased LNG exports,” according to the EIA.

If Texas were its own country, it would be the world's third-largest producer of natural gas and the fourth-largest producer of oil. In the first half of 2022, the U.S. became the world's largest LNG exporter, led by Texas and Louisiana, according to EIA data.

The bill has Republican cosponsors; U.S. Rep. Michael Cloud, R-Texas, is introducing companion legislation in the House.

It would amend the Natural Gas Act to expedite non-free trade agreement (FTA) export permits enabling an accelerated application approval process. It doesn’t change existing restrictions for some countries, clarifying that “any nation subject to sanctions or trade restrictions imposed by the United States is excluded from expedited approval.” It also states that the president or Congress “may designate nations that may be excluded from expedited approval.”

“Congress finds that expanding natural gas exports will lead to increased investment and development of domestic supplies of natural gas that will contribute to job growth and economic development,” the bill states.

Cruz also reintroduced the Protect LNG Act earlier this year to ensure courts can’t vacate previously authorized LNG permits. It would prevent courts from halting LNG permits when a lawsuit is filed and require that cases only be filed in the circuit court jurisdiction where the LNG facility is located, not the location of a federal agency that issues the requested permits, The Center Square reported.

If signed into law, it would prevent federal judges in Washington, D.C., from halting LNG permits in Texas, as they did last year. In 2023, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approved a $24 billion Rio Grande LNG Terminal and Rio Bravo Pipeline project in South Texas. Last year, three federal judges in Washington, D.C., halted the permits.

Cameron County Judge Eddie Treviño, Jr., a Democrat, argued they took “unprecedented” action and “threatened thousands of jobs, undermined economic growth in Texas, and put future investment in renewable energy infrastructure at risk,” The Center Square reported.

Houston Mayor John Whitmire, a Democrat, also blasted former President Joe Biden’s LNG ban, saying it was “a huge mistake,” The Center Square reported. Biden suspended LNG exports as Europe was “begging for it. They need it for national security,” Whitmire said, adding that Texas exports helped lessen European dependence on Russian oil.

After Russia invaded Ukraine and failed European wind and solar projects couldn’t meet demand, oil and natural gas and electricity prices skyrocketed. European countries found themselves scrambling to obtain reliable energy sources, turning to Texas. U.S. LNG exports provided a lifeline “largely thanks to Texas energy production and export infrastructure,” Texans for Natural Gas argued, The Center Square exclusively reported.

Under the Trump administration, the RGV FERC approvals were reinstated, Biden administration policies were reversed and new policies were implemented to “unleash” domestic production, including expediting permitting approvals.

The U.S. leads the world in LNG exports, with the Port of Corpus Christi leading LNG exports in Texas, The Center Square reported.

Nearly 25% of U.S. natural gas reserves are located in Texas; 30% of the largest hundred natural gas fields in the U.S. are in Texas, The Center Square reported.

The U.S. LNG industry “contributes a whopping $43.8 billion toward the U.S. GDP, and generates $11 billion in tax and royalty revenues for local, state and federal governments,” The Center Square reported.

Ramona Timmons, who lives in Berlin’s Prenzlauer Berg neighborhood, bought a two-meter-wide balcony solar unit this summer.
Körnig of BSW says there is a “very large potential” for uptake of balcony solar across the 30 million residential units in Germany’s two-family or multi-family houses.
“There are legal gray areas — authorities often haven’t distinguished between rooftop and balcony solar,” he says.
The British government is considering allowing balcony solar to be installed in households across the country as part of its solar power strategy.","The sun was shining brightly one August morning in Möckernkiez, a minimalist housing complex beside the leafy Gleisdreieck Park in central Berlin.

Inaugurated in 2018, the innovative, cooperative-run estate is a model of green living. More than 3,000 residents across 471 apartments in the car-free district receive heat and electricity via clean energy such as biogas and rooftop solar.

And two years ago, the residents received a novel boost to their green energy supply when 70 solar panels were installed on their balconies. Today, the panels are dotted all across building façades, hanging beside plants and racks of drying clothes.

“It was the wish of several residents,” says Bernhard Drechsel, technical director at Möckernkiez. “They came together and proposed this. They wanted to make an extra individual effort.”

In doing so, the residents joined the ranks of what are today more than a million people across Germany who have installed balkonkraftwerk (balcony solar), an increasingly popular renewable energy technology that is democratizing access to solar across Europe’s largest economy. While each unit currently only produces a modest amount of energy, the cumulative impact of their large-scale adoption is contributing to Germany’s target of sourcing 80 percent of its electricity from renewable sources by 2030.

Balcony solar — also known as “plug-in” solar, since it can be connected directly to a wall outlet — is accessible to practically anyone that has minimal outdoor space with decent sunlight, including those who may not even have a balcony.

Installation, which requires little more than plugging in the appliance, is easily done without an electrician. And thanks to falling production costs and government subsidies for balcony solar units, which can be bought online or in stores for just a few hundred euros, it’s easier than ever for individuals to produce their own green energy.

The result is that these panels are opening the solar market to huge numbers of German citizens, including renters previously excluded from access to domestic solar generation due to red tape for rooftop panels, which often requires users to own their residence and to obtain permission from a local utility.

“Plug-in solar devices help reduce household energy costs and create greater energy independence for citizens, regardless of subsidies or large investments,” says Carsten Körnig, managing director of the German Solar Association (BSW), which represents more than 1,000 solar companies across the country. “They also increase acceptance of climate protection measures and the urgently needed global energy transition.”

Balcony solar emerged in Germany around the 2000s but didn’t catch on until a few years ago, according to Körnig, when policy changes brought plug-in solar devices “out of their niche” and turned them into a consumer product. In 2019, for example, the government passed its technical regulations for plug-in solar devices, allowing them to use standard electrical plugs and feed into the grid via their in-built inverters.

“That made a big difference in Germany,” says Berit Müller, managing director of the Berlin Brandenburg section of the German Solar Energy Society, the country’s oldest consumer protection association for renewables. “Before, obtaining a permit required a lot of paperwork. Now it’s a lot easier [to obtain permission for] than rooftop solar. Balcony solar has exploded in popularity since then.”

Experts like Müller say that the pandemic lockdown also helped fuel the surge in popularity, as people spent more time at home, allowing them to carry out household upgrades. More recently, escalating energy prices in Europe linked to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine made balcony solar even more economically attractive, he adds.

Last year, further policies were passed, with Germany streamlining its regulatory framework for balcony solar.

The registration process was “simplified considerably,” recognizing that plug-in solar devices are essentially power-generating household appliances, says Müller. Last fall, it also became mandatory for landlords and homeowners to approve the use of plug-in solar devices for tenants, whereas in the past it was up to their discretion, if they were asked.

As a result, the take-up has been lightspeed. As of late June, 1,009,390 balcony solar systems were registered with the German Federal Network Agency, including more than 220,000 added in the first half of 2025 alone. Given many haven’t been officially registered, Müller says that the real figure is likely to be two or three times higher.

Ramona Timmons, who lives in Berlin’s Prenzlauer Berg neighborhood, bought a two-meter-wide balcony solar unit this summer. “I’d been thinking about it for a few years,” said Timmons, an office manager who lives with her partner. “The more energy we can produce without coal, the better for the planet.”

Rock-bottom prices have sweetened the deal: Timmons bought a 800W unit for just €80 after receiving a €250 subsidy from Berlin city authorities.

“It’s basically no cost,” she adds. “The installation was so easy.”

The practical advantages of plug-in solar devices, which quickly pay for themselves, are convincing more and more people. A YouGov survey commissioned by BSW at the end of 2024 found that around eight percent of the 2,043 respondents said they planned to purchase a plug-in solar device within the next twelve months. A further nine percent said they could imagine purchasing a plug-in solar device at some point in the future.

Körnig of BSW says there is a “very large potential” for uptake of balcony solar across the 30 million residential units in Germany’s two-family or multi-family houses. “The solar boom on Germany’s balconies is likely to continue,” he says.

Yet not everyone is convinced. Dieter Wettig, who has a ground-floor apartment in Möckernkiez, says that even if he did have a balcony he would not install a plug-in unit due to the emissions made during their manufacturing.

“Electricity from balcony power plants is not entirely emission-free, mainly due to manufacturing processes,” he says, expressing a preference for wind or hydropower.

Wettig nevertheless added that, during operation, balcony solar systems are “practically emission-free, quiet, and climate-friendly … its contribution to the decarbonization of energy supply therefore remains significant.”

But given their relatively low capacity and the fact that the market is still in its infancy, even proponents admit that plug-in solar devices are only expected to contribute a low single-digit percentage to solar generation capacity in Germany, despite their popularity and increasing prevalence. Regulations currently limit each system to a maximum 800 watts — enough to power household appliances like refrigerators — though if there is enough space, multiple units can be installed.

Dylan Ryan, a lecturer in mechanical and energy engineering at Edinburgh Napier University in Scotland, adds that while balcony solar is undoubtedly becoming more attractive, geographical and political contexts such as electricity prices, building regulations and weather will dictate their popularity elsewhere.

“Germany is further south than Scotland, so there’s more sun, and electricity is more costly there,” he says. “It’s a much more clear-cut offer. But here it’s not the same.”

Ryan, who has calculated the effectiveness of balcony solar in certain settings, adds that the fast-growing market still has a number of planning, workforce and legal issues to iron out.

“There are legal gray areas — authorities often haven’t distinguished between rooftop and balcony solar,” he says. “And at this stage, there’s a lack of expert advice for the public. More workers need to be trained.”

Some manufacturers don’t meet the required safety levels either, which could lead to fires — even if there’s been little sign of that so far, says Ryan.

But those issues could soon be addressed.

In order to guarantee technical safety and to create legal certainty, the world’s first balcony solar product standard is being developed by BSW and will be published in December, enabling manufacturers and testing laboratories to produce and test plug-in solar devices in accordance with the standard.

Batteries are also being developed to store energy from balcony solar units, allowing energy to be used at a later date, increasing the benefits to users.

And the market continues to scale up, in Germany and abroad. Earlier this year, Utah legislators streamlined regulations for homeowners to buy and install them — and Vermont is set to follow suit. The British government is considering allowing balcony solar to be installed in households across the country as part of its solar power strategy. Meanwhile, sun-kissed Spain is emerging as a “rapidly growing” market.

“The German example can be implemented worldwide,” says Körnig.",https://reasonstobecheerful.world/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_8745-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-27 11:20:56.469006

In the three months ending on Sept. 30, Norfolk Southern moved nearly 8.8 million tons of coal for U.S. power plants, according to a financial presentation on Thursday, a 6% increase from the year before.

That’s the reverse of a year ago, when the railroad moved 8.8 million tons for overseas markets. This year, the railroad’s export tonnage fell 16%.

Export coal has fallen this year amid foreign competition in metallurgical coal, the kind used to make steel.

Norfolk Southern taps southern West Virginia’s coal reserves, which are rich in met coal. It is shipped by rail to the port of Norfolk, Virginia.

Rival CSX has seen a similar change in its coal shipment patterns. Norfolk Southern is preparing for a merger with the nation’s biggest rail carrier, Union Pacific.

The shift in coal shipments reflects two other factors. One is the rising price of natural gas, which makes coal more competitive to generate electricity.

It could as well reflect the energy policy preferences of the Trump administration, which has favored fossil fuels instead of renewables.

The White House has ordered at least one coal generator in Michigan to stay on the grid past its retirement date, and there could be others.

For the first nine months of the year, Norfolk Southern’s domestic coal shipments surged 11%, while its export tonnage declined 7%.

Challenges and the path forward The working group underscored that policy coordination, legislative certainty, and efficient institutional capacity remain the main prerequisites for success.","Namibia’s emerging energy mix – spanning oil, gas, renewables and green hydrogen – is poised to transform the national economy by the end of the decade, with the combined potential to add more than US$3 billion in annual GDP and create tens of thousands of jobs.

At the Namibia Public-Private Forum held in Windhoek from 23 to 24 October 2025, Dr Grant Muller of the Namibia Green Hydrogen Association and Eduardo Rodriguez of the Namibia Petroleum Operators Association co-chaired the Energy, Oil, Gas and Green Hydrogen Working Group, outlining a consolidated strategy to align the sectors with the Sixth National Development Plan (NDP6) and the Swapo Manifesto Implementation Plan.

Integrated growth vision

The working group described the four sectors as complementary and interdependent, forming the backbone of Namibia’s industrial transformation. The approach positions green hydrogen, hydrocarbons, renewables, and nuclear energy as mutually reinforcing pillars that, together, can unlock Namibia’s long-term energy security, fiscal stability, and export competitiveness.

According to projections tabled at the forum, the combined industries could lift national GDP by between 6.8% and 25% depending on the scale of investment and production achieved by 2030.

Muller said the transformation “requires no direct government equity or funding, only a stable and predictable policy environment.”

The group emphasised that precise, enabling regulation was the key to unlocking multi-billion-dollar private investments and accelerating industrialisation under NDP6.

Namibia’s new export frontier

Namibia’s green hydrogen and ammonia projects are projected to produce 2.2 million tonnes of green ammonia and 2 million tonnes of direct reduced iron (DRI) per year by 2030, surpassing the initial targets of 1.3 million tonnes.

Once commercialised, the sector could inject about US$2 billion annually into GDP and create more than 30,000 direct jobs, with an estimated multiplier effect of two to three times across supporting industries.

The working group said green hydrogen has now moved from feasibility to the financing phase, but lengthy approval processes and fragmented institutional oversight constrain the sector’s growth.

It recommended the establishment of a single inter-ministerial governance framework to coordinate permitting for land, servitudes, environmental clearances and access to export infrastructure.

The group also called for the government to designate flagship hydrogen projects as nationally strategic and to assign a responsible entity with the authority to fast-track approvals and coordination.

On financing, developers are requesting the enactment of sector-specific legislation to provide investors with protection and legal certainty for large-scale project finance. A globally competitive fiscal regime, benchmarked against hydrogen-producing countries such as Mauritania and Saudi Arabia, was also proposed to improve Namibia’s position in the global market.

Converting discoveries into production

In the offshore Orange Basin, Namibia’s oil and gas prospects have gained international attention following discoveries by TotalEnergies, Shell and Galp Energia. The working group said these discoveries could propel Namibia into the ranks of oil-producing nations within the decade if development is accelerated and licensing delays are resolved.

The group projects that by 2030, Namibia could have three final investment decisions (FIDs) and at least one floating production storage and offloading vessel (FPSO) in operation. This initial phase could contribute 6.8% GDP growth, equivalent to US$1 billion annually, and create about 12,000 jobs.

In a high-development scenario of four FPSOs, production could reach 150,000 barrels per day – about 55 million barrels per year – generating approximately US$3.3 billion in GDP contribution and supporting more than 45,000 direct and indirect jobs.

To maintain investor confidence, the working group recommended a phased, flexible implementation of the National Upstream Local Content Policy, with differentiated requirements for the exploration, appraisal, development, and production stages.

It also called for the regular awarding of new exploration licences, noting that none had been issued since 2022. The group urged the Ministry of Mines and Energy to finalise outstanding offers from previous bid rounds and to institute at least one annual licensing round to sustain investor momentum.

To reduce duplication and enhance efficiency, operators are proposing a system to facilitate the trading and sharing of seismic and well information among licensed companies, thereby accelerating prospect appraisal and shortening exploration timelines.

The group further proposed that Namibia ratify the ICSID and New York Conventions, which provide international arbitration mechanisms to safeguard investor rights and to introduce rebalancing mechanisms in petroleum contracts. These would allow contract terms to be adjusted fairly in the event of material changes, such as tax reforms, regulatory shifts, or force majeure events.

Expanding grid and market access

Namibia’s renewable energy programme, supported under NDP6, targets installing 400 MW of renewable capacity by 2030, up from the currently installed 367 MW. Solar and biomass remain the main focus areas, with projections suggesting that local photovoltaic manufacturing alone could contribute N$37 billion to GDP by 2050.

However, the group identified significant infrastructure constraints and minimal transmission capacity for electricity exports.

It called for urgent bilateral engagement with South Africa, Zambia and Botswana to explore grid interconnection and expansion opportunities, including greater utilisation of the Zambezi interconnector and flexibility to allow renewable producers access to the HVDC transmission line.

To encourage private-sector participation in energy infrastructure, the working group recommended legislative amendments that would allow private companies to invest directly in grid expansion and transmission projects.

Regarding the Modified Single Buyer (MSB) market model, the group requested that embedded-generation projects operating under take-or-pay agreements be exempted from complex scheduling and balancing rules, which they say discourage investment.

It further proposed allowing Regional Electricity Distributors (REDs) and Local Authorities (LAs) to enter short-term power purchase agreements – up to 3 years – if they can secure power at a price below NamPower’s current tariff levels, enabling cost reductions for end users.

Employment and fiscal impact

If implemented as planned, the energy, oil, gas and hydrogen portfolio could collectively generate more than 75,000 direct jobs by 2030, with indirect employment effects exceeding 200,000.

The combined GDP contribution is projected to rise to between US$2 billion and US$3.3 billion per annum, depending on the scale of oil output and hydrogen exports.

Renewables are expected to add about 800 direct jobs, while the hydrogen and hydrocarbons sectors will account for the bulk of employment growth through industrialisation and infrastructure development.

The plan aligns with NDP6 economic targets, including achieving 7% annual GDP growth, expanding industrial exports, and supporting the Swapo Manifesto goal of transforming energy into the country’s number-one economic enabler.

Challenges and the path forward

The working group underscored that policy coordination, legislative certainty, and efficient institutional capacity remain the main prerequisites for success.

It is recommended that the government establish an Inter-Ministerial Energy Coordination Mechanism, with representation from the Ministries of Mines and Energy, Environment, Finance, and Industrialisation, as well as NamPower, NamWater, and NamPort.

The mechanism would ensure faster project approval, harmonised regulation, and alignment of infrastructure investments with NDP6 priorities.

As part of the following steps, the group proposed that all pending Energy and Petroleum policy instruments be finalised within six months, and that Namibia position its strategic projects as regional models for energy transition partnerships.",https://africanminingmarket.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/exxon-mobile-corp_oil-exploration.jpg,N,,2025-10-27 11:21:12.186802

One of the companies that has been underpinning this growth is Fluor and we sat down with Sunil Vyas, Technical Director for Business Incubation and carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) Subject Matter Expert at the company.

We talked about the company’s evolving role in the carbon capture sector, its work with emerging climate technologies, and how shifting global policies are shaping the pace of decarbonization.

Could you start by telling us about your background and current role at Fluor?

I’ve been with Fluor for about 26 years, based in Southern California. I started as a process engineer working on syn-gas generation projects for hydrogen, methanol, ammonia. Later, I joined our carbon capture technology team, which was developing post-combustion capture solutions even back in the late 2000s.

People were already interested, but they were still trying to understand the true costs and implications. One of the major early projects was the Boundary Dam competition in Canada where Fluor was one of the bidders. I led the process engineering side. Had we won, my career might have gone in a different direction.

A few years later, I moved into corporate strategy and now split my time between two roles. One is leading business incubation—working with startup technology companies focused on the energy transition. We don’t invest or take equity; we act as engineering partners to help them scale and commercialize. The idea is, when they reach demonstration or commercial scale, we already have a trusted relationship.

The other role is as Fluor’s CCUS subject-matter expert. That means working on strategy, client engagements, and helping to change the perception that Fluor is only an EPC (Engineering, Procurement, Construction). We are that, but we also license our own carbon capture technologies.

Where does Fluor stand today in the CCUS space?

We play three roles. First, as a technology licenser. Our Econamine FG Plus post-combustion capture technology has been around for over three decades. We’ve licensed about 30 plants—mostly smaller, older facilities. The technology has evolved significantly since then, especially in reducing energy use and improving solvent management.

Right now, we have four projects in or near completion of the FEED phase across the U.S., Canada, and Europe, covering power generation, waste-to-energy, and refinery reformers. On the pre-combustion side, we also license Fluor Solvent technology for removing CO2 from natural gas or syngas streams.

Second, we are an EPC provider, historically technology-neutral. We’ve built capture projects using other technologies. One example is Shell’s Quest project in Alberta, where we handled pre-FEED through EPC. We’re also working on Heidelberg’s oxy-combustion project in Germany.

Third, we’re active in emerging technologies. This is where we differ from most EPCs, we engage with startups early. We’ve worked with CarbonFree, which produces calcium carbonate and HCl from CO2; with several e-fuels developers; and we’ve signed an MOU with Carbfix for mineralization storage, where CO2 is injected into basalt to form rock.

“When startups work with experienced engineering partners, it boosts bankability. For us, the partnership also helps us stay “smart.”” – Sunil Vyas, Fluor

We’ve also worked with direct air capture (DAC) players like CarbonCapture Inc. Unfortunately, DAC has faced headwinds lately after the DOE cancelled the DAC Hub awards in the U.S., and we were part of four of those proposals. But we expect smaller projects to continue in Europe and Canada.

Lastly, we’re part of the Carbon to Value Initiative, a carbontech accelerator now entering its fifth year. It’s been invaluable in connecting us with startups and keeping us close to where innovation is happening.

That accelerator connection ties to the “bankability” issue startups often face. Is Fluor’s engagement partly about improving project credibility?

Exactly. When startups work with experienced engineering partners, it boosts bankability. For us, the partnership also helps us stay “smart.” By engaging with early-stage technologies, our subject-matter experts stay current on where the market is heading—whether in carbon capture, energy storage, or advanced nuclear.

So while we’re helping startups scale, we’re also helping ourselves evolve and stay aligned with the next generation of technologies.

You mentioned that your post-combustion technology has improved. How so compared to a decade ago?

The biggest advances have been in energy efficiency, environmental performance, and especially solvent maintenance.

Every flue gas has contaminants like oxygen, SOx, NOx, that degrade amines over time. Most systems use a reclaimer intermittently, which causes performance swings. We operate solvent maintenance continuously, like a pool filter, keeping degradation products low at all times.

That allows what we call “day one operation” indefinitely—consistent performance without fluctuations. This was successfully tested at TCM in Mongstad, Norway.

What capture rates can your systems achieve today?

Historically, clients asked for 90%. Now, almost all designs target 95% CO2 capture, and we can achieve that. Above 95%, costs start to rise steeply, so it’s about finding the right balance. There’s no real regulatory mandate for 95%, but many projects set it as a target, especially in Europe where some funding models or offtake agreements tie incentives to reaching that threshold.

“The key is that 45Q remains intact” – Sunil, Vyas, Fluor

Do your current projects involve enhanced oil recovery (EOR)?

None of our recent projects have included EOR, though we’d be open to it. The updated 45Q tax credit, which increased utilization value to $85 per ton, could revive interest if oil prices support it.

On the topic of 45Q—what happens if greenhouse gas reporting requirements are rolled back in the U.S.?

For Fluor, probably minimal impact. But for the broader CCUS industry, inconsistent federal rules could create a patchwork of state regulations, potentially chaotic.

That said, most companies are under investor pressure to report emissions anyway. Transparency has become tied to credibility and access to capital. If reporting were relaxed, it might slow progress but not stop it.

Relevant: EPA Rollback Set To Erase Carbon Emissions Reporting And Limits

The key is that 45Q remains intact, and that’s huge. While other clean-energy incentives faced changes this year, 45Q was strengthened, particularly for utilization. So despite headwinds like DOE cancellations, CCUS in the U.S. still has momentum.

How do you see regional trends like the U.S. versus Europe and beyond?

Europe’s arrow is pointing up. You’ve got Northern Lights operating, Heidelberg’s Brevik cement project capturing CO2, and new UK government funding for capture projects. Even when it’s a competitor’s technology, every successful project lifts the entire industry.

In the U.S., things are slower at the moment, but globally, we’re seeing strong government support in Europe. We’re focused mainly on North America and Europe, with offices in Asia-Pacific and the Middle East, though activity there is still limited.

Data centers and AI are creating massive new power demands. How do you see carbon capture fitting into that?

Data centers are a hot topic. Their power demand is huge and they want it fast. Options range from natural gas to nuclear, geothermal, and renewables plus storage.

If developers go with gas-fired generation, it’s unlikely they’ll include capture immediately, it takes longer to build. But they can design carbon-capture-ready plants, making it easier to retrofit later.

Hyperscalers are new players that have never built power plants before. They’re learning fast, and if they’re willing to pay a premium for clean power, it could accelerate innovation across several technologies.

Finally, what’s next for Fluor in this space?

We’re focused on helping both established companies and startups move from concept to commercial scale. We want to be there when these technologies scale up, because that’s when decarbonization really happens.",https://carbonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sunil-vyas.png,N,,2025-10-27 12:09:45.110703

A record number of Americans went electric vehicle shopping last quarter. Between July and September, EVs accounted for 10% of new vehicle sales in the U.S. and almost 30% in California. Cue the confetti cannons? Maybe hold off. This EV demand surge was partly a mad dash before federal tax credits vanished on September 30.

Permitting reform to the rescue?

Permitting reform writ large is having a moment. It’s one of very few initiatives—along with National Seersucker Day —that both Democrats and Republicans can get behind. California has been running an EV station permitting reform experiment for over a decade.

Our 482 cities and 58 counties are responsible for permitting new EV-charging infrastructure. That adds up to 540 potential bottlenecks and a thicket of local rules to navigate. In 2015, the state tried to streamline this permitting process. Under AB 1236, localities must approve an EV-charging-station permit unless there’s substantial evidence of specific and adverse impacts on public health or safety. When many local governments ignored this directive, legislators upped the ante with a “shot clock.” Under AB 970, cities and counties have 20 or 40 days to make a decision, depending on the size of the project. If the timer runs out, the permit is automatically approved.

So how is permitting reform working on the ground? I live in Piedmont, a three-square-mile city with high incomes and green politics. Over a year ago, I blogged about our local Shell gas station’s proposal to re-invent itself as an EV-charging hub. That project has given me a front-row seat to watch EV infrastructure permitting reform in action.

Developers first applied for a permit in 2024. During the long and deliberative process, community members raised concerns about noise, traffic, and crime. When the city of Piedmont finally approved the permit last November, approval was subject to 45 conditions: signage, fencing, security plans, operating-hour limits, staffing, noise-mitigation measures, picnic benches, lighting, landscaping, canopies – the list was long.

In March of this year, the state Attorney General issued a pointed alert to all local governments reminding them of their obligation to streamline EV-charger permitting and remove unreasonable barriers to entry. After that letter was issued, the Shell project withdrew its original permit and re-applied under the streamlined process. Developers could remove requirements that the design review process had imposed —no canopies, no benches, no limits on operating hours. The city, facing a ticking shot clock, had no choice but to issue the permit in a matter of days. The neighbors, as far as I understand, felt blindsided.

I’ve been curious to know whether similar stories have been playing out across California. I went hunting for permit data and found this treasure trove. The team at Shovels has been building an impressive dataset that tracks building permits, contractors, and project attributes. They generously shared their county-level permit data for publicly accessible EV charging projects in California. The graphic below summarizes how permitting waiting times have been falling over time.

The graph clearly shows that permitting times have been decreasing in recent years. If you squint, it looks like wait times started to decrease after the AB970 “shot clock” took effect, and decreased further after the stern reminder from the AG. Correlation need not imply causation, but these data suggest that California permitting reform has helped to grease the wheels of EV infrastructure development in communities across the state. Presumably, with shorter permit turn-arounds comes fewer costly conditions and lower barriers to entry.

Where the permitting reform rubber meets the road

There’s an emerging consensus, thank you Ezra Klein, that progressives have become so good at blocking “bad” development that we’ve completely hamstrung our ability to build good and necessary projects. At a moment when decarbonization headwinds are blowing strong, clearing permitting roadblocks and limiting NIMBY veto power seems particularly urgent.

One lesson I think we are learning in California is that permitting reform isn’t just about rewriting the rules, it’s about making sure people know what the rules are, and that someone’s keeping time (with a stop watch!) to make sure the rules are followed. My hometown anecdote also has me thinking harder about the losing side of this reform experiment because the NIMBY’s in this story are my neighbors. It’s painfully clear that the NIMBY veto has had far too much power and needs to be reined in. That said, if “deemed approved” means “no one asked the neighbors,” things can get messy. Permitting reform is not going to be a one-and-done rule change, it’s an ongoing experiment in balancing community voice with the urgency of building the clean infrastructure we need.",https://energyathaas.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/screenshot-2025-10-26-at-7.42.13-pm.png,N,,2025-10-27 08:58:55.075436

A study last year by project planning software developer Paces that focused on New York and Illinois said prospective acreage and potential renewable project site capacity are in decline. Moreover, developers often face opposition to large projects on optimal land from rural landowners and neighboring communities.

One way to open up greenfield acreage to solar is to demonstrate how well a project can fit with the life and commerce of the region. Last spring, Texas-based Vesper Energy commissioned its 600 MW (AC) Hornet Solar project, the first of a trio of projects that will bring 1 GW of new solar capacity along with 400 MW of storage to the Texas panhandle. In addition to providing renewable energy to the ERCOT grid, the project’s 3,800 acres is also hosting upwards of 2,500 sheep grazing among the rows of tracking PV modules.

Zach Wald, vice president of engineering, procurement and construction at Vesper, told pv magazine USA that the key to success in rural solar development is to meet early and often with the community and stakeholders at all levels.

“Our community affairs team really did a great job of going out, meeting individuals and spending a spending a lot of time explaining what solar looks like,” Wald said. “What’s the process like and what does it mean for them?”

In the case of Hornet Solar, the discussions involved how the project would exist in conjunction with vegetation that was important to pollinators, such as insects, which are a vital part of agriculture. Wald said that concerns about the pollinator mix for a given prospective site and other agrivoltaics issues are not just good for business but are part of the company’s core principles and guidance to be as environmentally responsible as possible.

“A lot of counties require a report on pollinator mixes, but even if they don’t we’re going to do it anyway,” he said. “That’s one of the benefits of solar. While the footprint at Hornet might be 3,800 acres, there is a lot of open space between the panels. Pollinator mixes and grazing sheep, like we have at Hornet, are perfect use cases for the land while you are generating the energy.”

Co-locating sheep with solar is an interesting development. Vesper reports the site also is patrolled by 11 herding dogs monitoring their charges. According to Wald, sheep grazing on large-scale rural solar projects has evolved industry wide over the last five years or so. Such projects don’t have a lot of moving parts (trackers move sedately and don’t startle the animals) and support lot of growing grass.

“We tried out goats, but they didn’t work so well,” Wald said.

Goats are too rambunctious, perhaps, and have a tendency to climb things. You don’t want goats on your solar array.

The project includes more than 1.36 million Boviet bifacial solar modules mounted on Array Technology Duratrack HZ V3 single-axis trackers. Sungrow supplied 195 of its 3600 inverters.

Hornet Solar and its follow-on projects, Hornet Solar II and Nazareth, each planned as 200 MW (AC) arrays with 200 MW of storage (the original Hornet project does not have storage), are located in what is essentially an optimal location.

“That area of West Texas is just great for solar in general,” Wald said. “It has all the characteristics you’re looking for. It’s nice flat land, lots of sunshine and a transmission line running right through there with load available. So, when searching for a perfect solar site, that’s the blend you’re looking for.”

Again, Wald credits early engagement with the landowners and the community with enabling Vesper to lease the land necessary to move such a significant solar project forward. You need to have a lot of conversations and answer a lot of questions, he said. On top of that, a developer needs to be able to move forward on the project quickly once the deal is made so as not to generate any bad blood.

“I’ll just say as a general construction practice, especially in solar, you want the planning to take a long time and you want construction to take a short time, right?” Wald said. “That’s a successful project.”

An agrivoltaics mindset is essential for gaining access to the dwindling number of greenfield potential project sites that are still available. Each region will have different needs and concerns.

The opportunities are out there. Luigi Resta, president and CEO of Utah-based developer rPlus Energies told pv magazine USA that utility-scale solar projects are generally welcomed by landowners and rural communities in his part of the country. The company’s Pleasant Valley Solar projects in Idaho are situated on flat sage brush high-plains desert that doesn’t have much value as agricultural land. The landowners derive more income from leases than they would from farming or ranching.

“Solar is kind of the highest and best use of this rural land,” Resta said.",https://pv-magazine-usa.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/10/Dog-at-Vesper-2-1-1200x835.jpg,N,,2025-10-27 11:21:50.898657

“We’re a team of experienced professionals but we also think fresh about investing and fees,” said Arbor Avenue co-founder Neil Weissman.
Instead of working under contract, Arbor Avenue partners hold equity in &Partners, so they share success, rather than just fee income, with the national firm that stands behind them.
Local advisors help shape the national firm and its strategies.
“Arbor Avenue, with the national power of &Partners are disrupting financial services and investment management, for the better.” The practice is located in Ann Arbor with clients across Southeast Michigan and Northwest Ohio.","While so much in business has changed, one sector stands out as it operates much the same as when stock tickers dominated its offices.

Now, one Southeast Michigan-based independent practice, Arbor Avenue Private Wealth, has set out to lead disruption in personal financial services by doing things differently.

It starts with cutting fees and costs

Arbor Avenue combines big investment firm experience with a nimble, client-centered approach that works to be different in important ways for its clients. It starts with reducing fees and costs that clients may have been paying at other firms for many years but also may not see just by glancing at their statements. “We’re a team of experienced professionals but we also think fresh about investing and fees,” said Arbor Avenue co-founder Neil Weissman. “It was very difficult to find an environment like that, so we joined one to benefit our colleagues and our clients.”

No limits on types of investments

Arbor Avenue does not have limits, as many large firms do, on the types of investments it can offer its clients so they can work to protect and build their families’ financial futures. “We have the freedom to work with our clients in ways that we couldn’t before, including investments in commercial real estate and private equity,” Weissman added. “There’s no reason, now, for our clients to have to find another firm to be able to invest in the ways that they want, with carefully selected leaders in their sectors.”

Multi-generational family business

Another difference is that under its model, Arbor Avenue can work as a multi-generational family business, assuring its clients continuity in the future. “My sons, Mike and Rob, both investment pros in their own right, have joined us as partners,” said Ron Eppler, co-founder. “Erica Fowler, our invaluable director of operations and client service, is also a partner. We’re committed to the long-term future of our team, so our clients don’t have to worry about getting passed from advisor to advisor. Our clients appreciate that in years to come, they’ll be working with someone at Arbor Avenue they know and trust.”

A different kind of national partnership

The practice’s relationship with the fast-growing and pioneering national firm, &Partners, represents another key difference for Arbor Avenue, which was the sixth group in the country to affiliate with the firm that started in 2023. Instead of working under contract, Arbor Avenue partners hold equity in &Partners, so they share success, rather than just fee income, with the national firm that stands behind them. In less than two years, &Partners approached 90 teams nationwide, with more than 300 advisors, and nearly $50 billion in assets under management, providing strength and collaboration that all points toward client success. Local advisors help shape the national firm and its strategies.

“Our promise to clients is that we’ll serve as their Personal CFO,” added Mike Eppler. “We now have the system to do that and act, at all times, in their best interests.”

“We all hear a lot about disruption in business now,” added Rob Eppler. “Arbor Avenue, with the national power of &Partners are disrupting financial services and investment management, for the better.”

The practice is located in Ann Arbor with clients across Southeast Michigan and Northwest Ohio. More information is available at arboravenue.com.",https://s3-rd-prod.crainsdetroit.com/styles/1200x630/s3/eppler-team-jpg.jpg,N,,2025-10-27 17:04:49.248756

“This partnership underscores the University of Michigan’s commitment to global collaboration in addressing the challenges and opportunities presented by the energy transition and the drive for more sustainable development,” said Jonathan Overpeck, Samuel A. Graham Dean of SEAS.
“Partnerships focused on Asia provide the opportunity for growing our research and innovation impact in society not just at home, but across the globe.","The University of Michigan, led by the School for Environment and Sustainability, the William Davidson Institute, and the Asian Development Bank, have signed a memorandum of understanding establishing a partnership to strengthen collaboration on sustainable development initiatives across Asia and the Pacific.

The collaboration aims to connect global knowledge across regions to support the clean energy transition across ADBs developing member countries and builds on shared commitments to inclusive, sustainable growth and country-led development.

Through this initiative, U-M and WDI will work collaboratively with ADB on a wide range of projects across the Asian region, including in clean energy and e-mobility, climate and health, water, food security, and biodiversity.

Experts from U-M and WDI will serve as academic research partners and collaborators to ADB’s teams and their counterparts in the bank’s developing member countries, ranging from government officials to stakeholders across industry and academia. Established in 1966 and based in Manila, ADB today has 69 member countries, 50 of which are from the Asia-Pacific region.

“This collaboration will help us tap into Michigan’s expertise and access global innovation to create more opportunities to advance inclusive and sustainable development in the region,” said Scott Morris, vice president of ADB.

“By joining forces with the University of Michigan and the William Davidson Institute, ADB is reinforcing our commitment to empowering communities with knowledge, skills, and access to solutions that will build resilience, drive economic opportunity, and shape a more prosperous future for Asia and the Pacific.”​

This announcement comes on the heels of Morris’s visit to U-M, where he participated in an event, “Powering Asia’s Future: Climate Innovation and the Energy Transition,” which was a wide-ranging discussion on the energy and climate transition across the continent and what it means for the world. The talk was followed by the panel discussion, “Great Lakes to the Pacific: Energy Transition Insights in Michigan and Asia.” Both events were sponsored by SEAS and WDI. Morris also visited Detroit, where he met with members of the SEAS Detroit Sustainability Clinic, Michigan Center and Newlab Detroit.

The partners will commission actionable research, engage in projects in ADB member countries, facilitate regional roundtable discussions, and host cross-learning activities — both in Asia and the Pacific and in Michigan — allowing for knowledge sharing and collaboration among policymakers and practitioners from ADB member countries and Michigan-based experts and decision-makers.

“This partnership underscores the University of Michigan’s commitment to global collaboration in addressing the challenges and opportunities presented by the energy transition and the drive for more sustainable development,” said Jonathan Overpeck, Samuel A. Graham Dean of SEAS. “By connecting University of Michigan’s leadership in workforce and technology innovation and research with deep regional and local expertise across Asia and the Pacific, we can help advance equitable, resilient development. No one nation or region has all the answers, so the benefits of us learning from and with one another are very exciting.

“Partnerships focused on Asia provide the opportunity for growing our research and innovation impact in society not just at home, but across the globe. The climate crisis is a global problem that requires global solutions.”

SEAS brings the unparalleled strength in the interdisciplinary education, research and innovation that is needed to accelerate the energy transition and create a more resilient and sustainable planet.

Working across campus with WDI and ADB creates opportunities for partnerships between universities and other stakeholders in Asia and the Pacific to support a common goal of developing the leaders of tomorrow in a region that has the largest greenhouse gas emissions and is facing the most devastating impacts of the climate crisis.

The partners will continue to define and implement joint initiatives through mechanisms such as knowledge sharing, convenings, study tours, training programs, student internships, and access to shared publications.

Recognizing the critical link between human capital and sustainable growth, the collaboration will also promote training and entrepreneurship to connect innovators from ADB member countries with Michigan’s research institutions and entrepreneurship ecosystems and open opportunities for Michigan ventures to access Asian markets. WDI will lead efforts to foster cross-regional learning, business opportunities, technical training, and market access.

“This agreement reflects WDI’s deep belief that innovation and thriving ventures are central to building healthier, more sustainable futures,” said Wendy Taylor, president and CEO of WDI. “By working alongside the University of Michigan and the Asian Development Bank, we’re creating pathways for inclusive economic growth that engage communities, strengthen innovation ecosystems, and accelerate progress toward a clean energy future — from Detroit to Manila.”

The partnership also aims to accelerate e-mobility development by working with key stakeholders to support electric vehicle adoption, supply chain innovation, and workforce development, building on work to date. In July, with support from ADB, WDI released the report “Driving a just transition to e-mobility in the Philippines” with research findings based on its collaboration with ADB and the Apl.de.Ap Foundation International.

In addition to extensive market research, WDI’s engagement in the project involved field work in the Philippines and engagement via focus group discussions, interviews and company and university site visits. While the research primarily focuses on the Philippines, the team also examined e-mobility progress in other countries in Southeast Asia, particularly in the policy realm, to contextualize the findings.",,N,,2025-10-27 09:17:59.304076

Tesla is licking its wounds after a weak Q3 earnings print. Revenues grew nearly 12%, reversing two consecutive periods of decline. But the sales rebound looks inflated, with demand pulled forward as customers rushed to capture expiring EV tax credits.

Tesla’s third-quarter revenue hit $28.1 billion, comfortably exceeding the $26.4 billion forecast. Automotive revenue rose 6% to $21.2 billion, from year-ago $20 billion. Profit, however, told a harsher story. Tesla reported adjusted earnings of 50 cents per share, missing the 54-cent estimate. Net income declined 37% to $1.37 billion, or 39 cents per share, compared with $2.17 billion, or 62 cents, a year earlier. The sharp drop in profitability is attributed to a 50% surge in operating expenses, much of it tied to AI and other research and development initiatives.

Regulatory credit revenue fell 44% to $417 million from year-ago $739 million. Regulatory credits are rewards for Tesla for producing electric vehicles (EVs) that have zero emission. Tesla monetizes its regulatory credits by selling to traditional automakers that can’t meet their emission quotas.

The quarter marked the abrupt end of federal tax credits for electric vehicles, which expired at the close of September under a new law signed by President Donald Trump in July. The legislation ended federal tax credits of up to $7,500 for new EVs and $4,000 for used EVs.

The incentives were originally scheduled to last until 2032 under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA). The retroactive elimination prompted a rush of consumer purchases before the deadline and left the market bracing for a slowdown in subsequent quarters. While the immediate effect was a temporary lift in Tesla’s U.S. sales, it was essentially a borrowing of demand from future quarters.

The decision to end the EV credits well before time may have been shaped by the acrimonious relationship between Trump and Tesla chief executive Elon Musk. What was once a brewing bromance devolved into open hostility and public insults, effectively collapsing the rapport in May-June of this year. The ugly spat began with Elon Musk criticizing the Trump administration’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” - a new tax and spending bill proposed by Trump. In characteristic fashion, the president struck back forcefully and Musk’s unfiltered comments seem to have hardened that stance.

Trump has a history of reacting sharply and then reconsidering his position, a pattern that Wall Street has dubbed as the basis of TACO trades, by which investors profit from his policy reversals.

The President even sought to justify Musk’s outburst, acknowledging that Musk was frustrated by the removal of EV subsidies and mandates that could hurt Tesla’s business. Had Musk exercised more restraint, there is a reasonable likelihood that the administration might have delayed or somewhat softened its decision to end EV credits. Instead, Musk’s combative posture appears to have worsened the policy outcome, with consequences extending well beyond Tesla to the broader EV industry.

Elon Musk’s infamous quotes:

June 3, The first cracks in the bromance, when Musk criticized Trump’s Beautiful bill : “I’m sorry, but I just can’t stand it anymore. This massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination. Shame on those who voted for it: you know you did wrong. You know it.” - (Pork is a term in U.S. politics used to describe government spending seen as wasteful or politically motivated — typically funding directed to specific constituencies or local projects to curry favor or votes.)

Accusing Trump of ""ingratitude”: ""Without me, Trump would have lost the election.""

Expanding criticism from Beautiful Bill to Trump’s trading policy: “The Trump tariffs will cause a recession in the second half of this year.”

Making a serious public allegation: “Time to drop the really big bomb: @realDonaldTrump is in the Epstein files. That is the real reason they have not been made public. Have a nice day, DJT!” - This post on X, was later deleted by him. (Epstein was a convicted sex offender, who ran a vast network exploiting underage girls. His high-profile connections in politics, business, and entertainment fueled controversy after his death in jail in 2019.)

Damage control a week later: “I regret some of my posts about President @realDonaldTrump last week. They went too far.” (This was widely perceived as a tactical retreat, after Musk realized his fallout with the president could hurt his business interests.)

Between June 3 and June 5, Tesla stock erased 17% of its value, but began to recover after Musk expressed contrition on June 11.

The episode is a reminder that even a visionary enterprise is not immune to the cost of intemperance. Tesla’s performance is now as much a reflection of Washington’s shifting sentiment as it is of its technological prowess.

The lesson for business leaders is pretty straightforward: watch your mouth if that’s where your money goes.

Nvidia as a Counterexample

Contrast Tesla with Nvidia, another tech giant facing complex political and regulatory landscapes. Jensen Huang’s leadership remains Nvidia’s greatest asset. Under his prowess, Nvidia has navigated the U.S.-China trade tensions, and export restrictions, with pragmatism and restraint.

China has been a key market for Nvidia, representing $17 billion or 13% of Nvidia’s sales for the fiscal year that ended in January. But Nvidia’s market share in the region has weakened from 95% before 2022 to just 50% after U.S. regulators tightened restrictions on selling high-end AI chips to China over national security concerns. Instead of resisting policy constraints, Nvidia adjusted swiftly by introducing the H20, a watered-down version of its H100 GPU designed for U.S. compliance — demonstrating its agility in navigating complex regulations.

When the H20 was also effectively blocked, Huang described the ban as “deeply painful,” and his pragmatic leadership was on display repeatedly: He lobbied effectively to ease U.S. restrictions on H20 chip exports. Huang framed the discussion around America’s AI leadership, patiently persuading the administration that the modified H20 posed no national security risk and cautioning that U.S. dominance in AI could be compromised without a rethink of export rules.

He was quoted saying:

“We ought to go and give American companies the opportunity to compete in China, offset the trade deficit, generate tax income for the American people, build, hire jobs, create more jobs”

“The world is right now hungry, anxious to engage AI. Let us get the American AI out in front of everybody right now.”

“The Chinese market is large. They’ve got a billion users, and so it’s not a market that you could easily decide to walk away from if your ultimate goal is for America to win the AI race.”

“If America, the American tech stack, is 80% of the world, then we are doing a good job winning the AI race. If the United States is 20% of the world, then we’ve lost the AI race.”

Huang walked a fine line between appeasing policymakers and advancing Nvidia’s goal of selling in China. The Trump administration eventually relented after Huang’s disciplined, behind-the-scenes engagement. Nvidia regained limited access to the Chinese market, without theatrical social media outbursts. Huang even agreed to give 15% of H20 sales to the U.S. government without batting an eyelid.

After having crossed the U.S. roadblocks, Huang accepted China’s subsequent rejection of Nvidia’s H20 and RTX Pro 6000D chips with composure. Chinese regulators have reportedly directed companies like Alibaba and ByteDance to cancel orders for Nvidia’s RTX Pro 6000D processors - another tailor-made chip for China. Huang admitted he was “disappointed” with China sidelining its AI chips, but struck a pragmatic tone by saying Washington and Beijing “have larger agendas to work out… we’re supportive of both governments as they sort through these geopolitical policies.”

Instead of dwelling on the setback, Nvidia shifted strategy – assuming a “China zero” baseline in financial guidance and treating any China-related sales as potential upside rather than expectation.

The recent U.S. approval to sell AI chips to the UAE drove Nvidia stock to new highs. Tesla shares are up just 7% year-to-date vs. Nvidia’s nearly 40% rally. Tesla has a market cap of 1.4 Trillion, less than a third of Nvidia’s $4.5 trillion.

The difference is clear: where Musk’s volatility creates a “headline risk” that affects Tesla’s market perception, Huang’s composure builds strategic leverage. The market has clearly shown that leadership today is as much about managing relationships and tone as it is about innovation and execution.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/62fe40baadccff017f1dbcbd/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-10-27 08:58:58.231947

Indeed, while e-bikes are growing in popularity, cities are still set on maintaining infrastructure that supports the use of cars.
Experts believe e-bikes are not only a solution to cutting pollution from travel pollution, but also improving public health among residents.
While both EVs and e-bikes are great options to reduce pollution, EVs still release their own form of pollution, like tires that produce more microplastics.","With e-bike adoption outpacing electric cars in some cities, experts agree that cities must create infrastructure that supports the form of transport, as an even more environmentally friendly travel option than EVs. The transformative solution to traditional vehicles for short-distance travel can further reduce urban congestion, pollution, and public health challenges.

As a bonus, reforming infrastructure to work for e-bikes is cheaper for cities than producing car-reliant infrastructure.

""It really is a public benefit to get people from point A to point B without needing to park or drive a car,"" Kendra Ramsey, the executive director of California's Bicycle Coalition, told Grist.

Cities are responding with e-bike rebate programs designed to make the transition more accessible.

One Canadian initiative helped residents increase their weekly cycling by 25 miles while reducing car use by 11 miles. A report by Alex Bigazzi, a researcher in transportation engineering, found that the program cut travel-related pollution by 17% annually and increased physical activity by 13%. In Denver, an e-bike voucher program has eliminated 170,000 vehicle miles traveled each week.

Yet challenges remain. Infrastructure in many cities is still built for cars, leaving cyclists and e-bike riders exposed to safety risks.

Greg Rybarczyk at the University of Michigan-Flint told Grist that city infrastructures must be refitted for more adoption.

Indeed, while e-bikes are growing in popularity, cities are still set on maintaining infrastructure that supports the use of cars. Detroit is one example of a place where e-bikes are picking up speed, but residents still believe the bike lanes are unsafe and not well-maintained, making it difficult to use the sustainable option for most travel, according to Grist.

Grist reports that cities are now facing a choice. Both rely on uplifting sustainability through e-bikes or EVs. They can either ""invest in relatively cheap improvements to make cycling safer, thus encouraging people to cycle more, or double down on car infrastructure to accommodate EVs, thus encouraging people to drive more and endanger pedestrians and cyclists.""

Experts believe e-bikes are not only a solution to cutting pollution from travel pollution, but also improving public health among residents. While both EVs and e-bikes are great options to reduce pollution, EVs still release their own form of pollution, like tires that produce more microplastics.

""So the cost of cycling infrastructure — even high-quality, protected infrastructure — is really relatively cheap, in terms of providing mobility in cities,"" Bigazzi emphasized.

The Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit (also known as the 25C tax credit) can help offset the expense of updating or upgrading major home systems while also lowering energy consumption.

Understanding the 25C Tax Credit

Homeowners in the United States may be eligible when they install qualifying energy-efficient equipment in their primary residence such as all-climate electric heat pumps, insulation, windows and other improvements. The credit is subject to some limitations; for example, a homeowner can only claim up to $2,000 per year for a heat pump. The installation must be an addition or improvement to an existing home, not a new home, and can be used in combination with other tax credits or incentives such as local, utility and federal incentives and IRA programs.

The current version of this tax credit was implemented Jan. 1, 2023, and expires Dec. 31, 2025. In addition, rising energy costs and potential regulatory changes in 2026, such as updated guidelines on refrigerant, make late 2025 a strategic time to upgrade systems.

Smart Ways to Use the Tax Credit

Generally, energy-saving upgrades are some of the most common home improvement projects because they enhance the home’s overall function while increasing the potential for cost savings on energy bills.

Some qualifying upgrades do double-duty by enhancing the home’s curb appeal while reducing energy requirements. Common examples include windows, skylights and exterior doors.

Insulation and air sealing materials such as caulk and weatherstripping are also common choices, especially in older homes where insulation may be below current standards and settling has created gaps for air leaks.

Another common selection for homeowners looking to take advantage of the 25C tax credit is climate control systems, and an increasing number are turning to all-climate, all-electric heat pumps. One major reason is their high performance when it comes to energy efficiency. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, today’s heat pumps can reduce electricity use for heating by 65% compared to electric resistance heating. In fact, Mitsubishi Electric all-climate, all-electric heat pumps have an efficiency rating at 260-490% compared to traditional systems at or below 100%.

In addition to their proven track record, contrary to a popular misconception that all-climate heat pumps are only for milder regions, the systems can operate quite effectively in both high heat and extreme cold. As a result, they provide homeowners with greater comfort and control of their indoor climate.

Take Steps to Beat the Deadline

If you’re a homeowner planning to make upgrades and claim 25C tax credits, now is the ideal time to get your project underway.

Choose qualifying equipment. While some brands’ complete product lines meet the qualification criteria, others do not. Do your homework to ensure the model you’re installing is eligible for the credit. Your salesperson may be able to provide information, or you can visit the manufacturer website or contact the manufacturer directly for details.

Work with a certified contractor. Many reputable brands, including Mitsubishi Electric, offer a contractor network with highly skilled, knowledgeable and reputable installers.

Save your receipts to file. When you prepare your 2025 tax forms, you’ll need to complete IRS Form 5695. Specifically, you will need to provide the manufacturer’s pin number and other details about your purchase, including proof of purchase.

It’s important to note that EV sales were abnormally high in the summer and into September as consumers rushed to beat the tax credit expiration.

In September, EVs accounted for 12.9% of new-vehicle retail sales, the highest ever, and well above the 8.5% recorded a year earlier, according to a report by J.D. Power released late last week.

But once the tax credits disappeared the freefall began.

“In October, EVs represent just 5.2% of new-vehicle retail sales,” wrote Thomas King, president of the data and analytics division at J.D. Power. “On a volume basis, EVs account for 1.0 million of the 1.2 million-unit decline in the industry sales pace compared with a month ago.”

An analysis of EV sales between October 3--14 by auto sales and research site CarGurus.com concluded “early indicators show an approximately 68% decline in new EV sales compared to the same timeframe in early Sept. To put this in context even further, new EV sales have decreased by almost 43% compared to the same time a year ago.”

While the conventional thinking is EV sales began their nosedive solely because federal tax credits were no longer available, the top analyst at CarGurus says it’s not that clear cut.

“It looks like demand is kind of dropping, but what we don't know right now is how much of that demand is dropping due to the loss of the tax credit, versus did we just see a huge pull- ahead of October sales volumes into July, August, September, and then that's why we're seeing that significant a drop,” said Kevin Roberts, CarGurus director of industry analytics, in an interview.

That significant drop, however, is from months where EV buyers rushed to beat the end of the federal tax credits, creating some tough comparisons.

But not every EV or EV buyer qualified for those tax credits. Indeed, for those buyers who missed the deadline or didn’t qualify there are other deals to be found.

“One of the things I was saying going into it was if you did not actually qualify for that tax credit, you might be better off waiting until October, because you might actually get a better deal, as certain automakers might push better deals out into the marketplace in a post tax credit environment,” noted Roberts

Indeed, Scott Kunes, COO of the Kunes Auto & RV Group, with 31 stores in Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana and Minnesota, notes that General Motors Co, in particular, has come up with a way to offset the loss of the $7,500 federal EV tax credits.

“They stepped up on the residual values, working with GM Financial to kind of make up for that $7,500 tax credit that really we saw the strongest in demand, in lease performance,” said Kunes, in an interview. “Most of the EV vehicles, especially in September, were leased, so they're continuing that. They have a plan going forward as well to hopefully support those up until June of next year, and then even a plan further on from that.”

Indeed, if anything is going to soften the EV sales freefall it’s improving their affordability, asserts Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of industry insights at Cox Automotive.

The average transaction price for a new EV in September was $58,124, representing a $9,070 premium over what’s known as an ICE+ vehicle, or mild hybrid, according to a Cox Automotive report released on October 16, authored by Streaty.

The average listing price for a used EV last month was $34,575, down .3% from August and 6.5% from September, 2024, according to the report. That represented only a $679 premium over used ICE+ vehicles.

“I think that's the biggest challenge. There's not a lot of, not enough, affordable options for consumers,” said Streaty, in an interview. “You look at the most popular cars, you have Rav4 or the Honda CRV and the Camry, actually in September, I think was number three. So it just points out that consumers, if you have a good product at a good price, it'll sell.”

While EV mix of industry is down, discounts on EVs have increased to $13,161, up $2,211 from October 2024 and up $2,047 from September 2025, as manufacturers step in to replace some portion of the expired tax credit, noted Streaty.

Discounts on non-EVs were $2,423 in October, down $282 from a year ago.

As a dealer, Scott Kunes is counting on automakers reassessing their EV product lines by adding more affordable models, such as the upcoming return of the Chevrolet Bolt, noting, “putting more of an emphasis on that and trying to grow EV demand naturally, I think, is key to success here.”

Price isn’t the only reason for eschewing an EV purchase for many consumers. For many, it’s concern over driving range and a basic change in the familiar routine of quick fill-ups at a gas station.

For that reason, sales of hybrids, which offer the combination of fuel economy without having to change old habits, are taking off.

Kunes notes a sharp increase in plug-in hybrids at his group’s dealerships and is excited about the planned introduction of a hybrid version of the Jeep Wagoneer.

It’s a trend Roberts attributes to consumers looking for improved fuel economy, regardless of powertrain, but at an affordable price.

“We're seeing a lot of demand in hybrids in 2024 and in 2025 so I think the narrative that Americans just want gas guzzlers is over,” observed Roberts. “American consumers are totally fine with a fuel-efficient vehicle if the price is right and that's what you've seen with hybrids.”

Kunes is hoping, however, automakers will continue to reassess their EV product lines, producing more affordable vehicles in body styles consumers desire, asserting, “We had to invest quite a bit of money in order to get us ready for this, this EV future. I don't think anybody wants to abandon it completely.”

That’s not about to happen according to Roberts who predicts, “I think there definitely is a market, and I think that market will grow over time, particularly as you get the price points in the right segments, I think you'll see a lot more EV adoption out there.”",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/68fe6e6f5565d9bd5b0457c7/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-10-27 06:58:44.775141

This advanced system transforms how the industry approaches end-of-life battery processing, moving beyond traditional recycling limitations to achieve unprecedented material recovery rates.

Understanding the Revolutionary Approach to Battery Material Recovery

CATL directional recycling technology fundamentally differs from conventional recycling approaches by employing precision-engineered processes that target specific materials within battery structures. Traditional recycling methods often result in material degradation and significant losses during processing, whereas Brunp's Directional Recycling Technology (DRT) maintains material integrity throughout extraction.

The technology centres on three core principles: selective material targeting, minimal thermal degradation, and closed-loop processing integration. Unlike pyrometallurgical approaches that rely on high-temperature smelting, this advanced system preserves the molecular structure of valuable materials, enabling their direct reintegration into new battery production cycles.

Founded in 2005 and acquired by CATL in 2015, Brunp Recycling has evolved from a specialised lithium battery recycler into one of the world's largest battery recycling operations. The company's headquarters in Foshan, Guangdong province, serves as the technological hub for developing and refining these advanced recovery processes.

The Three-Stage DRT Process Breakdown

The CATL directional recycling technology operates through a sophisticated three-stage methodology that maximises material recovery whilst minimising environmental impact. Each stage builds upon the previous one, creating a comprehensive system for battery material extraction and purification.

Stage 1: Intelligent Dismantling Protocols

The initial phase involves automated disassembly systems that carefully separate battery components without damaging recoverable materials. This intelligent dismantling process differs significantly from mechanical shredding methods used in conventional recycling, which can contaminate materials and reduce recovery efficiency.

Stage 2: Hydrometallurgical Processing

Unlike high-temperature pyrometallurgical processes that typically operate between 1,000-1,400°C, hydrometallurgical processing uses chemical leaching at controlled temperatures. This approach enables selective material extraction whilst preserving material quality and achieving higher recovery rates across multiple elements.

Stage 3: Advanced Material Recovery and Refinement

The final stage focuses on purifying extracted materials to battery-grade specifications. This refinement process ensures that recovered materials meet the same quality standards as virgin materials, enabling their direct use in new battery manufacturing without performance compromise.

How Effective Is CATL's Material Recovery Performance?

CATL directional recycling technology demonstrates remarkable efficiency in material recovery, achieving industry-leading extraction rates that surpass conventional recycling methods by significant margins. Brunp Recycling's latest performance data reveals exceptional recovery capabilities across critical battery materials.

Critical Metal Recovery Rates Analysis

The effectiveness of this advanced system becomes evident through its material recovery performance metrics. In 2024, Brunp Recycling processed over 120,000 tonnes of used batteries whilst achieving unprecedented recovery rates across multiple critical materials.

These recovery rates represent substantial improvements over traditional recycling methods. Conventional pyrometallurgical processes typically achieve nickel and cobalt recovery rates around 95%, whilst lithium recovery through traditional methods often remains limited to 25-30% due to material losses in slag formation.

Comparative Analysis Against Global Recycling Standards

CATL directional recycling technology significantly exceeds emerging regulatory requirements for battery material recovery. The European Union's Battery Regulation, adopted in July 2023, mandates recovery rates of 95% for cobalt, copper, and nickel, and 70% for lithium by 2030.

Brunp's achievement of 99.6% recovery rates for nickel, cobalt, and manganese, combined with 96.5% lithium recovery, positions the technology well ahead of these regulatory thresholds. This performance advantage provides CATL with competitive positioning in markets where recycling compliance becomes increasingly stringent.

The cost-effectiveness of this advanced high‑voltage battery recycling emerges from its ability to produce battery-grade materials that compete directly with primary mining extraction costs. Furthermore, the high recovery rates suggest favourable unit economics compared to traditional recycling methods that require additional refining steps.

Brand new Center for American Progress and Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) analysis finds that upward of 107 million electricity customers (65 percent of all U.S. electric utility customers) and more than 46 million natural gas customers (59 percent of all U.S. natural gas utility customers) across 49 states and Washington, D.C., will face increased—or proposals for increased—utility rates by 2027. At least 210 U.S. gas and electric utilities have either already raised rates or proposed higher rates to go into effect within the next two years.* For some residents of Massachusetts, Missouri, Connecticut, New York, and Oklahoma, utility bills could increase by at least $35 per month—in one case, up to $60. Collectively, the in-effect and proposed rate increases would raise customers’ electricity and natural gas bills by $71.2 billion and $18.7 billion, respectively, by 2028.1

FIGURE 1

After closely mirroring inflation from 2013 to 2023, electricity prices have risen at double the rate of inflation over this past year.2 The trend of rapidly increasing electricity prices is a departure from the prior decade: More than 70 percent of states saw electricity prices decline in real terms between 2013 and 2023.3 What has changed? A multipronged storm of high natural gas costs, extreme weather, and increasing demand from artificial intelligence (AI) data centers is colliding with an aging electricity grid and a policy assault on new clean electricity deployment from the Trump administration—driving electricity prices higher.

Instead of addressing rising utility costs, the Trump administration has canceled projects for new energy supply, issued massive new tariffs that worsen supply chain concerns, and increased consumer costs by forcing expensive coal plants to run past their scheduled retirements.4 President Trump’s giveaways for the fossil fuel industry and attack on clean energy, coupled with the effects of rolling back clean energy tax credits via the Big Beautiful Bill, means that American households could spend upward of $430 more per year on their energy bills within the next decade.5 Millions more individuals and families across the country will face even higher utility bills as a direct result of the federal government’s actions over the past few months—actions that are likely to continue in the months to come.

Why energy prices are increasing

Americans are seeing higher energy bills due to a confluence of factors, including investment in outdated infrastructure, higher natural gas prices, and increasing energy demand. Some of the associated costs leading to increasing utility bills are necessary to build a modernized electric grid, while others will continue to inflict more costs on Americans due to natural gas price volatility or unchecked data center growth. Policymakers should prioritize the protection of ratepayers and invest in solutions to lower costs for households and businesses.

Grid resiliency and modernization

The U.S. electric grid is aging, with much of the system built in the 1960s and 1970s, and will not be able to meet expected energy and climate demands without undergoing significant upgrades and expansion.6 For example, transmission lines have a lifespan of 50 to 80 years, and 70 percent of current transmission lines are more than 25 years old.7 Likewise, more than half of distribution transformers in the United States are more than 33 years old, which means they are approaching their end of life.8 The aging domestic grid is vulnerable to risks that threaten energy access and affordability, which leaves Americans susceptible to power outages, increased costs from inefficient transmission and distribution, and cybersecurity risks.9

Climate-driven extreme weather is on the rise and showcases the vulnerability of the aging grid.10 Extreme weather is a leading cause of electric power outages: One study found that more than 70 percent of U.S. counties analyzed from 2018 to 2020 experienced at least eight hours of power outages during severe weather.11 As climate change continues to worsen, it will cost both utilities and consumers billions of dollars, including costs from power outage recovery and building a more resilient grid to avoid power outages.12

The United States must invest in upgrading and modernizing the electric grid. Indeed, modernizing and building a more resilient grid will require parts such as poles, electrical conductors, and finished wires that are made up of steel, aluminum, and copper.13 The Trump administration’s 25 percent to 50 percent tariffs are significantly driving up the costs of these commodities, as about 20 percent of steel, 70 percent of primary aluminum, and 40 percent of refined copper are sourced from other countries.14 In addition, ongoing legal challenges and the risk of new and changing tariffs create uncertainty, making it hard for domestic manufacturers and developers to make sourcing decisions to obtain the materials they need for grid modernization projects.15

All these factors combine to increase the costs for utilities to make necessary upgrades or replacements to the grid. The Trump administration has pursued policies that not only counter climate action but also take away support for grid resilience. The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has terminated more than $7 billion in grants, some specifically for grid deployment and mineral development for domestic manufacturing and energy supply chains.16 At the same time, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to rescind the endangerment finding, the basis for the federal government to regulate greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act; it has cited the DOE’s climate report—which was written by climate skeptics and utilizes cherry-picked data—in support of this rollback.17 The administration’s reversal on climate progress will slow greenhouse gas emission reductions—increasing emissions by an estimated 470 million tons in 2035, which is more than the emissions from every diesel car and truck on U.S. roads today and will likely increase the threat of extreme weather events in an ever-warmer world.18

Higher natural gas prices

Another reason that Americans’ energy bills are going up is the recent increase in U.S. wholesale electricity prices, which have risen by around 40 percent since the beginning of 2025.19 This increase is a direct result of rising natural gas prices. Natural gas generation currently provides about 42 percent of all electricity consumed in the United States—the highest it has ever been—and is often the fuel source setting the price for electricity in the market.20 With so much of the electricity market supplied and set by natural gas, U.S. electricity prices are now highly susceptible to changes in natural gas markets.21 In recent years, the gas market has been highly volatile, with massive swings and price spikes due to global forces, both man made and natural, and geopolitics.22

The jump in natural gas prices was so large that Oklahoma utility customers will now be making monthly payments for the next 25 years to pay off the gas bill from one week in 2021. Oklahoma Corporation Commission, “OCC Reports Finalized Uri Securitization Cost” (2024).

These high, volatile prices ultimately are passed on to electricity consumers. For example, during Winter Storm Uri in 2021, Oklahoma gas prices spiked 400-fold (from $3 to $1,200 per 1,000 cubic feet). The jump in natural gas prices was so large that Oklahoma utility customers will now be making monthly payments for the next 25 years to pay off the gas bill from one week in 2021.23 In 2022, Dominion spent an additional $1 billion on fuel costs due to the spiking of fossil fuel prices in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which paired with other COVID-19 and inflationary forces.24 These excess fuel costs were charged to and recovered from Dominion’s Virginia customers over the next three years to avoid the “rate shock” that would have occurred if Dominion had attempted to recover the costs over a single year, as normally done.25

Although natural gas prices fell and saw less volatility in 2024, gas prices are again on the rise.26 The U.S. Energy Information Administration expects natural gas prices to increase by more than 75 percent in the United States between 2024 and 2026.27 This increase in natural gas prices is largely attributable to rising U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports, which increase demand for U.S. natural gas and link the domestic natural gas market to the global market.28 LNG exports are projected to increase by more than 36 percent from 2024 to 2026, outpacing expected growth in U.S. gas supplies and leading to tightening domestic supplies and higher prices for U.S. consumers.29 The Trump administration has expanded U.S. LNG exports, including approving numerous export projects and brokering a deal with Japan on a joint venture for Alaskan LNG.30

Energy demand increases from data centers and AI

For the first time in a decade, U.S. electricity demand is on the rise,31 and it could grow by 25 percent by 2030, driven by data centers that provide AI, cloud-based, and crypto services.32 Without policy interventions, such as requiring data centers to pay their fair share of the generation and infrastructure costs necessary to connect them to the grid, data centers could potentially increase costs at alarming rates for American households and businesses if utilities do not have proper cost allocation approaches for new and large commercial and industrial customers.33

A new report from the Union of Concerned Scientists found that in 2024 alone, utilities in seven states covered by regional transmission organization PJM passed on more than $4 billion in additional costs to customers due to local transmission upgrades to provide transmission-level service directly to data centers.34 For areas located near large data centers, a Bloomberg News analysis found that each month, electricity costs rose 267 percent above where they were just five years earlier.35 Rising electricity demand, spiking due to data center use, could be responsible for increased electricity rates of 15 percent to up to 40 percent for all U.S. households in the next five years alone.36

Fair solutions that address affordability would require that data center customers, at a minimum, cover the full costs incurred by utilities to provide them with electricity and that guardrails are put in place to ensure those costs are never passed on to other customers, such as small businesses and households that are already facing an affordability crisis. Utilities must ensure that cost distribution of service and contribution of total system costs reflect each different class of customer accordingly and fairly—from residential to large industrial—especially with new and increasing data center demand. Unfortunately, the Trump administration’s “AI Action Plan” that emphasizes deregulation, including guidance to skirt environmental protections to spur the rapid development of data centers, offers inadequate solutions to address affordability and does nothing to address the distribution of costs for households.37 The plan recommends embracing new energy generation such as geothermal and nuclear fission but fails to prioritize renewables, such as wind and solar, that are low cost and quick to deploy compared with conventional generation sources such as fossil fuels.38 Rushing data centers online without cheaper and new generation sources likely will increase consumer prices and risk rolling blackouts.39

The need to modernize the grid, coupled with Trump administration actions and rising natural gas prices, means the surge in energy demand will continue to increase costs for Americans.

Trump administration actions that could increase utility bills for Americans in the next few years

The administration’s actions over the past 10 months, including signing the One Big Beautiful Bill Act into law, have exacerbated rising rates.40 Notably, the administration has consistently blocked and attacked clean energy, particularly on large wind and solar projects,41 that would make utilities less dependent on volatile and costly fossil fuels.42 A Princeton analysis found that the average U.S. household could spend more than $430 more per year on its energy bills within the next decade due to the Trump administration’s attack on clean energy, giveaways for the fossil fuel industry, and elimination of pollution standards.43

In August, the DOE extended an emergency stay-open order to delay the retirement of the J.H. Campbell coal plant in Michigan until mid-November.44 The Campbell coal plant was slated to close in May 2025; continuing to extend retirement is estimated to cost ratepayers nearly $140 million per year.45 The DOE also announced more than $600 million in investment to bail out the coal industry.46 Propping up the coal industry will drive up costs for consumers, as 99 percent of coal plants are more expensive to run compared with replacement by new solar or wind.47 Moreover, some coal-related efforts will not provide any domestic benefits, as the United States is a net exporter of coal, especially to Asia.48 The Big Beautiful Bill’s production tax credit for metallurgical coal, an ingredient in steel and other metals, gives a subsidy to nations that will benefit from producing more steel than the United States does.49

All these actions are increasing electricity costs for American consumers and exacerbating the rising energy affordability crisis that the United States is already facing.50

Conclusion

As millions of Americans face increasing utility bills, the Trump administration continues to prop up the fossil fuel industry while blocking projects and investments that would make it easier for utilities to deploy reliable and affordable energy.

Methodology

The electric and natural gas utilities listed in the tracker, and the associated increases in rates, were identified through online filings by utilities and records of decisions in state public utilities commission (PUC) dockets. The list includes rate increases that went into effect or were proposed to go into effect from January 2025 onward. The list is not comprehensive and will be periodically updated with additional rate increases from across the country in subsequent iterations of this report.

Each state’s PUC has different requirements for reporting data related to rate increases, bill impacts, distributional impacts, and monthly increases. The number of customers—including residential, commercial, and industrial—affected by rate increases, column E, primarily used Energy Information Administration (EIA) and S&P Global data for electricity and natural gas, respectively. Authors used 2024 EIA 861 data, as well as aggregated customer data, from three files: 1) Sales_Ult_Cust_2024: Aggregated total number of customers across customer classes by “Utility Number” and “State” for “Bundled” and “Delivery” service types, and for Parts A, B, C, and D; removed state level “Adjustments”; removed “Ownership” types of “Behind the Meter,” “Community Choice Aggregation,” and “Retail Power Marketer”; 2) Short_Form_2024: Aggregated total number of customers by “Utility Number” and “State”; and 3) Delivery_Companies_2024: Aggregated total number of customers by “Utility Number” and “State.” For S&P data, authors aggregated total customers by “Company Name” and “State.”

EIA and S&P data did not report the number of customers for some utilities, in which case the data were collected directly from utilities’ websites, investor presentations, or press releases. In some instances, rate increases affected only a portion of the customer base in a utility’s service territory and were reported by the utility through press releases or in the docket filings. The authors aggregated the total number of natural gas customers across sectors using EIA data to calculate the percentage of natural gas utility customers affected by the rate increases.

The time periods for revenue increases, column F, were collected using utilities’ press releases, webpages, and docket filings from PUCs. The time periods for increases fell into three categories: 1) increase in annual revenues, in which utilities did not specify a time period for the rate increase and instead requested or were approved to increase their annual revenue requirements until the next time they file and are approved for additional revenues; 2) specific time periods, in which single-year, part-year, and multiyear periods were explicitly mentioned in filing documents, press releases, or utility webpages; or 3) calendar years, such as 2025 or 2026. Some utilities did not specify whether the rate increase was annual or for a specific time period. The authors used the best available information from the utility to assign a time period when relevant.

The effective date and status for rate increases, columns J and K, respectively, were also collected using utility press releases, utility and PUC webpages, and docket filings. In most cases, authors were able to identify a specific date, month, or year from which a rate increase would be effective. In some instances, the request for a rate increase was ongoing and did not specify an effective date, with PUCs often suspending effective dates for 6 to 12 months. The authors made a conservative estimate based on available information, including expected decision dates or expected effective dates, such as “early 2026” or “second half of 2026,” to adopt an effective date.

The total revenue increase in column G was calculated based on revenue increases reported by utility websites or press releases, in news articles that included a direct quote from a utility spokesperson, or from docket filings. The total revenue numbers include additional revenues to be recovered from all customer classes, including residential, commercial, and industrial. Not all utilities reported an increase in revenue as a result of increased utility prices, and not all utilities reported monthly average bill impacts even when there was an increase in revenue and/or rate of return.

Since the time periods for revenue increases were not aligned across utilities, the authors calculated an estimated total additional revenue generated starting in January 2025 through the end of 2028, assuming that rates remained steady after the covered period. This methodology likely results in an underestimate of revenues for the time period because utilities often file for additional rate recovery to begin in the next cycle after the covered period, thus increasing utilities’ revenues beyond what authors estimated. Revenue estimates were calculated using the additional revenues reported by the utilities, the time period for increase (column F), and effective date for increase (column J). The time period for implementation of most revenue increases is before December 31, 2028, and the authors assumed that revenue increases during the effective time period for an increase continued until the end of 2028. Revenue increases prior to 2025 were not included in the totals. In cases where the implementation period stopped before December 31, 2028, revenues were prorated for the remainder of the four-year time period in order to standardize the data. Further, some utilities either requested or collected interim revenues before final approval from PUCs, which were included in the calculation below for the relevant amount of time. Authors assumed the revenue increase was evenly split across all days of the year and calculated prorated revenues using the remaining number of days until December 31, 2028. For example, Ameren Missouri was approved for additional annual revenues of $355 million starting in June 2025. To estimate its total revenue through the end of 2028, the authors assumed an annual increase of $355 million for each year from June 2025 through June 2028 and then calculated partial revenues for the remaining 214 days (four months) in 2028 at the rate of $355 million per year.

The monthly percentage increase (column I) and the dollar amount increase (column H) to the average residential bill were collected through utility webpages, press releases, news articles that included a direct quote from a utility spokesperson, or docket filings. In the case of multiyear increases, when utilities reported multiple increases to residential bills through the time period, the authors reported the total increase in monthly bills, when available. When percentage increases were not reported but the appropriate data were available, authors calculated a percentage increase across the relevant time periods. In instances where utilities had implemented an interim rate increase resulting in an interim increase in monthly bills, authors reported the interim increase and included footnotes with the final expected increase pending PUC approval. In instances where utilities reported multiple values for a monthly and percentage increase, either based on geography or type of customer, the authors reported the lowest reported estimate and included footnotes indicating other relevant increases.

The authors prioritized using primary sources for the revenue increases, monthly increases, time periods, and effective dates. In some instances, these values were not publicly reported by the utility or the PUC so are labeled as “N/A.” The authors note that this does not necessarily mean that there is no associated increase in revenues or customer bills; instead, it represents a lack of public data from the utility or PUC.

To calculate the total number of utilities increasing rates, the authors counted each individual subsidiary that filed for an increase with the respective state regulators as a unique utility. For example, CenterPoint Energy Resources Corp. filed for rate increases in both Minnesota and Texas. However, the company filed the requests doing business as two separate subsidiaries—CenterPoint Energy Minnesota Gas and CenterPoint Energy Entex—and were counted as two unique utilities.",https://www.americanprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/10/GettyImages-2153308785.jpg,N,,2025-10-27 11:22:02.688331

On July 21, 2025, Jones and his maintenance foreman, who was with Jones when the first log was sawn, sawed the last board, bringing to an end an almost 40-year legacy of Mackey’s Ferry Sawmill.","Tucked away in Roper, North Carolina, is Mackey’s Ferry Sawmill, the largest private employer in Washington County, until recently. Wilson Jones, the owner and operator of the sawmill, came to the difficult decision to shut down operations, due to the repercussions of the tariffs implemented by the Trump administration.

Not only did it result in the laying off of all 50 of Jones’ employees, but it also ended an almost 40-year legacy. Wilson Jones and his brother are sixth-generation lumbermen, carrying on the legacy that their great-great-grandfather, William Sawyer Jones, began. He received his first order for sawn lumber on July 26, 1884. He continued to operate the sawmill with his brothers and children over the following decades.

“Our business goes back to 1882,” Jones told the Carolina Journal. “My dad took over our Elizabeth City plant in 1960. In 1986, I was out of college, and my brother was about to graduate from college, and he decided that we would horizontally integrate because we had a mill in Elizabeth City that was cutting primarily yellow pine. There was a big demand at that time for the hardwoods.”

Wilson and his brother Stephen own and operate two small sawmills in North Carolina, which employed 130 individuals in northeast North Carolina. Their operation in Elizabeth City is still in operation. However, Wilson says that due to the tariffs, Mackey’s Ferry Sawmill, the operation in Roper, which employed 50 individuals, was forced to shut down.

In late 1986, Wilson came to Roper with his industry colleagues and bought the entire mill, piece by piece, at auction. By the end of the day, they had a sawmill. A year later, in 1987, the mill was fully operational.

They expanded over time. They rebuilt the old mill once, and then, from 1995 through 2002, they modernized it into the state it’s in today — a very modern hardwood sawmill, according to Jones.

During those years, they also witnessed a significant shift in the industry: Furniture manufacturing moved out of North Carolina and, eventually, out of the United States altogether. Like most hardwood mills, they adapted by exporting products to manufacturing regions in southern China (like Shanghai) and Vietnam.

Wilson told the Carolina Journal that about 80% of their product was exported to Asia.

We’re in this unique situation where we’re getting hit going and coming,” said Jones.

On “Liberation Day,” President Trump announced additional tariffs on Chinese goods starting at about 20%. The tariffs escalated until they reached about 150% on Chinese goods. China retaliated with a 120% tariff on American hardwood products, Jones told Carolina Journal.

At the time, Jones’s company already had about $350,000–$400,000 worth of lumber on ships bound for China. Bringing it back wasn’t an option — freight costs from China were about eight times higher in reverse. Jones tried rerouting through Vietnam. He found buyers, but the problem was that Vietnam typically uses lower-quality wood than the premium-grade lumber shipped to China. Jones had to take price concessions for quality and volume, ultimately facing a 40% loss.

Jones said Liberation Day “liberated” him from his business and personal investments made to it.

“I’m not talking about money, because I can think any independent lumberman would tell you that they are not in this industry to make money. They’re in it because they love it,” said Jones. “It’s taken 38 years of my time, effort, and life inside and outside from me. It’s taken a business that I enjoyed — and I do love the industry — from me.”

Of the 50 employees who worked with Jones at Mackey’s Ferry Sawmill, Jones said that more than 40 of them were there at least 10 years. Jones said that his maintenance foreman, whom he ran the last board through with, was there for the first cutting.

“They’re guys that are cold in the wintertime and sweaty and dusty in the summertime. They worked and worked every day, and they took care of their families, paid their taxes, and did all that stuff.”

Wilson Jones, owner of Mackey’s Ferry Sawmill

When Jones told his employees he had to shut down the mill, he offered them jobs at the Elizabeth City plant. About a dozen of those men are now employed there, but driving 60 miles to work isn’t feasible for many.

“I can’t express to you how good these guys were,” said Jones.

Jones continued, saying, “Supporters of tariffs argue that business owners should absorb the cost of the tariffs without passing it on to consumers by absorbing the cost through price increases or layoffs. They don’t seem to understand that it doesn’t matter whether it’s Mackey’s Ferry Sawmill or Dot’s Button Shop — the point is, we’re in business to make money.”

And Jones said that if the business can’t make money, it can’t absorb costs. If raw material costs suddenly rise, with current expenses up 30%, and revenues are cut by 30–40%, the business simply loses money. Jones said that expecting a business to continue operating under these conditions is just not realistic, whether it’s his sawmill or a giant like Procter & Gamble doesn’t matter.

While many of his customers will likely be able to find alternative US sources, his contact in China, as well as with two of his largest suppliers, said they are having difficulty filling the niche or supply gap that Mackey’s Ferry Sawmill previously covered, since Jones supplied a specific thickness.

The Carolina Journal asked Jones what he would like President Trump to know about how the tariffs have impacted him, his company, and his employees. Jones said that he would ask Trump to come down to his mill and take a real look at the situation.

“I mean, at least when he went out in western North Carolina, it looked like he genuinely cared,” said Jones. “Come down here and look, and don’t just make blanket edicts because that’s the edict of the day.”

Of the final shipments that Jones was preparing to send out, he told the Carolina Journal that, due to the new tariffs on furniture and cabinetry, he now has about 15-20 truckloads that were to be sent to his customers in Asia, which will not be purchased as a result.

Jones emphasized that policy issues, such as tariffs, are nuanced and that there are opposing viewpoints on solutions. But he said addressing problems effectively involves engaging in conversations with individuals who have different perspectives and working together to find solutions.

On July 21, 2025, Jones and his maintenance foreman, who was with Jones when the first log was sawn, sawed the last board, bringing to an end an almost 40-year legacy of Mackey’s Ferry Sawmill.",https://www.carolinajournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_1989-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-27 03:58:48.804086

The New Mexico State chapter of Citizens’ Climate Lobby (CCL) will host a virtual presentation open to the public Nov. 5 featuring author and hunger eradication activist Sam Daley-Harris. According to Sam, “agonizing, protesting, and turning off the news” aren’t our only options for making a difference on the issues we care about. There’s another way—what Daley-Harris calls transformational advocacy, a form of advocacy where you work to change an issue, and you are changed in the process. It’s not the only solution needed, but it is one essential missing piece: citizens awakening to their power.

Here are two examples.

Maxine Thomas said that she had a heart for service but was clueless about advocacy, especially political advocacy. After being trained and meeting with her Indiana members of Congress, Maxine said, “I was euphoric. I was on this high and felt I was part of something revolutionary.

Ellie Sparks said she was experiencing what she called “climate trauma”. She would read Bill McKibben’s book Earth and weep at home and weep at work. After being trained and meeting with 20 Congressional offices over four days, Ellie called the experience “sacred and profound.” From “I was clueless” to “I was euphoric”; from “climate trauma” to “sacred and profound”, that is transformational advocacy.

Stories like this are part of the completely revised and updated edition of Daley-Harris’ book, Reclaiming Our Democracy: Every Citizens’ Guide to Transformational Advocacy (Rivertowns Books 2025, paperback).

Feeling fed up with what’s going on in the world isn’t a flaw—it’s fuel, and Sam Daley-Harris wants to show you how to use it. All members of the public are welcome to join the presentation followed by Q&A on Wednesday, Nov. 5 from 6:30-7:30pm MST (Logon via Zoom, Meeting ID: 343 696 4851, Passcode: 696696).

“Sam was one of the original mentors to Citizens’ Climate Lobby’s founding members,” said Sara Ann Mason, resident of Los Alamos, State Coordinator for Citizens’ Climate Lobby in New Mexico, and a volunteer with the organization since 2021.

“He focused on eradicating hunger, and then by working with other organizations like CCL, he’s shown that his methods are applicable to a wide range of issues. We’re excited to learn from him so we can be most effective with what we care about most: building political will for bipartisan federal action to support the climate and energy infrastructure we need, not just in New Mexico but in the whole country,” Mason said.

In addition to hosting events like these, the New Mexico State chapter of Citizens’ Climate Lobby regularly meets with the offices of Sen. Heinrich, Sen. Lujan, Rep. Stansbury, Rep. Vasquez, and Rep. Leger-Fernandez to urge them to support effective climate and energy policy.

In contrast, electric vehicles (EVs) account for around 75% of demand; battery energy storage systems (BESS) cover 15%, while other uses – such as electric bikes and drones – make up the remainder. This shift has been driven by sustained innovation in battery design, chemistry and manufacturing, alongside economies of scale and improved production efficiency.

The global EV battery market is currently split between lithium iron phosphate (LFP) and lithium nickel cobalt manganese oxide (NMC) chemistries, each accounting for roughly half of total demand. LFP is the fastest-growing segment, already dominating energy storage deployment due to its lower cost and longer cycle life. However, supply chains for both chemistries remain geographically concentrated, raising concerns over the security of supply.

There are opportunities to tackle this concentration and thereby improve supply chain resilience. Innovation is a key one, with research ongoing into established and new technologies. Among technologies that have already been commercialised, improvements continue to bring down costs while boosting performance. At the same time, research into new technologies could reshape battery supply chains and enhance competitiveness over the medium and long term.

For new entrants in any mature technology sector, competing with established producers is very difficult, even with substantial financial backing. Innovation in next-generation battery technologies is sometimes seen as a way for newcomers to leapfrog incumbents. However, relying on potential disruptive breakthroughs is a precarious foundation for business success, and especially for broader industrial strategy. In the absence of an efficient, competitive battery manufacturing ecosystem, even promising advances may struggle to reach commercial scale quickly enough to deliver real benefits.

Several innovative battery approaches currently stand out. Sodium-ion batteries – which are similar to lithium-ion batteries in design, but substitute lithium with the more-abundant sodium – gained significant attention after lithium prices spiked in 2022. Thanks to timely investment and existing technological maturity, sodium-ion batteries have moved quickly towards commercialisation. In China, EVs with sodium-ion batteries entered the market in late 2023 and large stationary sodium-ion storage batteries were connected to the power grid in 2024. However, sodium-ion batteries can only compete with LFP batteries on cost in the context of high lithium prices or significant energy density improvements. In addition, with China projected to hold 95% of global sodium-ion production capacity by 2030, the technology is unlikely to provide a competitive opening for new entrants, although it could offer advantages in terms of technology diversification, especially when lithium prices are high.

Meanwhile, solid-state batteries have attracted attention and investment thanks to their promise of longer driving ranges and enhanced safety, although these have yet to be demonstrated in real-world applications. The term “solid-state batteries” covers a wide range of technologies; the most frequently mentioned advantages come from designs that are currently in the prototype stage.

While solid-state battery cells are already being produced, their integration into EV battery packs remains challenging. Among the most advanced, Chinese firm BYD plans to sell its first EV using all-solid-state batteries from 2027, with mass production following in 2030. Japan’s Toyota and Korea’s Samsung have set similar timelines.

Early costs will be high, reflecting immature manufacturing processes and supply chains, but premium markets – where customers value range and performance – could support early adoption, providing margins for manufacturers to navigate scale-up challenges and work towards lower production costs. Nevertheless, this implies that it will take time for solid-state batteries to make a dent in the mass market for EVs, and they will likely remain limited to premium segments until the first half of the 2030s.

Lithium-sulphur batteries are less mature technologically but are also receiving considerable attention, especially in the United States. Their appeal lies in storing more energy per kilogram, enabling lighter battery designs. However, they also require more space for the same amount of energy compared with today’s battery technologies, which limits their attractiveness for mainstream EV applications. The defence sector may prove an early adopter if production is scaled up at sufficient volumes and technical obstacles, such as safety concerns, can be addressed.

A similar approach – focusing on niche but already sizeable or growing markets – is being pursued by developers of several other innovative battery technologies, such as redox-flow and metal-air batteries, both of which target longer-duration storage.

Innovation takes time, and while researchers continue to develop potentially disruptive battery technologies, existing technologies keep advancing, driven by incremental improvements.

Since global EV sales began to rise exponentially after 2020, lithium-ion batteries have advanced rapidly across all metrics – a trend that has accelerated since 2023. Global prices for lithium-ion batteries fell by about 30% between 2020 and 2024 thanks to economies of scale and innovations in battery cell and pack manufacturing and design. At the same time, battery pack energy density rose by over 50% for NMC batteries and about 65% for LFP batteries, without compromising safety or longevity – on the contrary, safety standards have improved substantially, and EV battery lifetimes are exceeding expectations. Fast-charging capabilities have also surpassed any previous record. In early 2025, BYD and CATL released batteries that enable 400-500 kilometres of additional range to be added in just five minutes – a timeframe comparable to refuelling conventional cars.

For new technologies to gain market share and reshape the battery industry, their viability alone is insufficient; the critical point is industrial scale-up, which ultimately determines the transformation of markets.

Viewed through this lens, established battery technologies retain a clear advantage. Manufacturing capacity for solid-state batteries that is already installed, under construction or has reached a final investment decision represents just 1% of the total battery manufacturing capacity, and 80% of these projects are in China; for sodium-ion batteries, this share is 4% (and this capacity is almost exclusively in China). The remaining 95% of capacity has been planned to produce lithium-ion batteries. While actual market shares may differ due to excess production capacity, the limited manufacturing base – coupled with higher initial costs and lower technological, supply chain and market readiness – is set to constrain the near-term potential of emerging chemistries.

Given this, new technologies are expected to capture a relatively small share of the 2030 market. Even so, a small share of a fast-growing market can still represent a major opportunity, with battery demand projected to expand more than threefold from 2024 to 2030 and fivefold to 2035 based on today’s policy settings.

Still, competition is fierce. China has now become a key engine of battery innovation worldwide. The same incumbents that dominate lithium-ion production are investing heavily in innovation – CATL alone invested over USD 2.5 billion in research and development and employed more than 20 000 researchers in 2024.

Tomorrow’s leaders in next-generation batteries will be those that pair technical breakthroughs with manufacturing efficiency, strong supply chains and a skilled workforce, much as today’s lithium-ion batteries industry has done. Skills, suppliers and operational know-how must transfer smoothly across technologies if innovation is to translate into competitiveness.

Even disruptive energy technologies often require time to gain a foothold in global markets, particularly one as large and fast-growing as the battery sector. While current project pipelines suggest that established lithium-ion technologies will continue to dominate until at least the mid-2030s, emerging technologies developed today may secure critical niches and help position producers for long-term competitiveness. Specialised segments, such as premium applications, can allow producers to build experience, generate profit and eventually move towards the mass adoption of new technologies.

Looking ahead, innovation will remain at the core of the battery industry, underpinning continued improvements in performance and cost, enabling access to new applications and markets, and reinforcing the central role of batteries in energy systems.

The Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit (also known as the 25C tax credit) can help offset the expense of updating or upgrading major home systems while also lowering energy consumption.

Understanding the 25C Tax Credit

Homeowners in the United States may be eligible when they install qualifying energy-efficient equipment in their primary residence such as all-climate electric heat pumps, insulation, windows and other improvements. The credit is subject to some limitations; for example, a homeowner can only claim up to $2,000 per year for a heat pump. The installation must be an addition or improvement to an existing home, not a new home, and can be used in combination with other tax credits or incentives such as local, utility and federal incentives and IRA programs.

The current version of this tax credit was implemented Jan. 1, 2023, and expires Dec. 31, 2025. In addition, rising energy costs and potential regulatory changes in 2026, such as updated guidelines on refrigerant, make late 2025 a strategic time to upgrade systems.

Smart Ways to Use the Tax Credit

Generally, energy-saving upgrades are some of the most common home improvement projects because they enhance the home's overall function while increasing the potential for cost savings on energy bills.

Some qualifying upgrades do double-duty by enhancing the home's curb appeal while reducing energy requirements. Common examples include windows, skylights and exterior doors.

Insulation and air sealing materials such as caulk and weatherstripping are also common choices, especially in older homes where insulation may be below current standards and settling has created gaps for air leaks.

Another common selection for homeowners looking to take advantage of the 25C tax credit is climate control systems, and an increasing number are turning to all-climate, all-electric heat pumps. One major reason is their high performance when it comes to energy efficiency. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, today's heat pumps can reduce electricity use for heating by 65% compared to electric resistance heating. In fact, Mitsubishi Electric all-climate, all-electric heat pumps have an efficiency rating at 260-490% compared to traditional systems at or below 100%.

In addition to their proven track record, contrary to a popular misconception that all-climate heat pumps are only for milder regions, the systems can operate quite effectively in both high heat and extreme cold. As a result, they provide homeowners with greater comfort and control of their indoor climate.

Take Steps to Beat the Deadline

If you're a homeowner planning to make upgrades and claim 25C tax credits, now is the ideal time to get your project underway.

Choose qualifying equipment. While some brands' complete product lines meet the qualification criteria, others do not. Do your homework to ensure the model you're installing is eligible for the credit. Your salesperson may be able to provide information, or you can visit the manufacturer website or contact the manufacturer directly for details.

Work with a certified contractor. Many reputable brands, including Mitsubishi Electric, offer a contractor network with highly skilled, knowledgeable and reputable installers.

Save your receipts to file. When you prepare your 2025 tax forms, you'll need to complete IRS Form 5695. Specifically, you will need to provide the manufacturer's pin number and other details about your purchase, including proof of purchase.

How climate policy rose to the top Until recently, climate protection dominated public discourse, around the world and particularly in Europe.
Thus, climate protection became a business and climate change offered endless opportunities to spend, regulate, and posture, with limited accountability for results.
But the politics of climate change — often marked by apocalyptic rhetoric, moral posturing, and costly symbolism — appears to have peaked.","Australia has long been a proving ground for climate policy. Governments have announced ambitious targets, introduced complex regulatory schemes, and committed substantial subsidies to renewable energy. Outcomes, however, are mixed. Australia remains one of the world’s largest coal exporters. Although coal-fired generation is declining, the pace of the transition to wind, solar, and storage has been slower than anticipated, and the rollout of electricity generation transmission infrastructure is struggling to meet the 2030 target.

Debates intensified with the release of the National Climate Risk Assessment in 2025, presented as a sober appraisal of future risks. However, critics argued that the report relies on implausible scenarios of runaway coal use and global population growth, citing disaster cost projections attributed to climate change, even though an underlying review links rising losses primarily to increased population and property exposure rather than Australian CO₂ emissions. Such framing may generate headlines but risks undermining credibility and the international collaboration that effective climate policy would require.

Climate protection is the textbook case of a global public good: non-rivalry and non-excludability create strong incentives to free ride, leading to suboptimal collective outcomes. Unilateral Australian policies and actions have negligible direct effects on global temperatures; their value rests largely on demonstration, technology development, and diplomatic leverage rather than on measurable climate impacts per se. Countries and individuals who cut emissions bear the costs themselves, while the benefits are distributed worldwide. The incentives for any one country to act independently and substantially are therefore weak. Citizens care less about the global average temperature than about the local consequences — what they experience in their own environment.

Although international agreements could, in theory, solve this dilemma, in practice, they have dismally failed. Many signatory states are authoritarian, uninterested in constitutional principles and in the well-being of their own and other citizens. It was never credible that they would implement costly climate treaties for the sake of humanity’s future. Even more democratic countries retreat when the domestic costs bite, as the United States did when it exited the Paris Agreement under President Trump.

Behavioural and political economy considerations

There is evidence that “peak climate policy” may already have passed in many jurisdictions, and Australia may not be an exception. A behavioural economics and political economy lens helps explain why enthusiasm is cooling after years of moralised rhetoric about existential risk. Governments and voters now confront high fiscal costs, limited near-term climate benefits, and costly economic distortions created by complex policy instruments. As competing priorities — defence, pensions, infrastructure — press on limited budgets, grand narratives are giving way to more modest, pragmatic debate. Two questions follow: how climate policy rose to public prominence, and why doubts are now growing.

How climate policy rose to the top

Until recently, climate protection dominated public discourse, around the world and particularly in Europe. National politicians and representatives of the United Nations warned of an “existential threat” and “the greatest challenge in human history”. Yet, despite all the warnings and massive climate protests, fossil fuel use, global greenhouse gas emissions, and average temperatures continue to rise. By contrast, climate protests have dwindled if not fully disappeared; only media attention to “climate catastrophes” has not yet waned. In the 1990s, it seemed unlikely that climate protection would become a guiding political theme. Reducing CO₂ emissions and other greenhouse gases imposes immediate costs, while the benefits are very distant and uncertain. Politics and society generally prefer the opposite: benefits first, costs later. Despite these obstacles, climate protection became a dominant political cause, influencing elections and mobilising the streets. Modern politics, in combination with behavioural economics, helps explain why: the harder a problem is to solve and the longer it persists, the more it lends itself to being a political and moral topic. Thus, climate protection became a business and climate change offered endless opportunities to spend, regulate, and posture, with limited accountability for results. Six mechanisms were central.

1. Expressive behaviour. Because one nation’s contribution to emissions hardly matters for climate change, the effectiveness of its emissions reduction policies is almost irrelevant. Public discourse thus revolved not around efficiency but around climate change as a moral issue. Governments pledged long-term “net zero” targets decades away, while the true costs would fall on future administrations. Symbolism, not substance, dominated. In Australia, period ratcheting of targets fits this pattern, which is typical for Western democracies. The latest goal — cutting emissions by 62%-70% below 2005 levels by 2035 — may prove overly ambitious. Emissions are currently about 28% below 2005 levels, with only modest progress in recent years (a decline of roughly 1.4% over the past year, and little change relative to three years ago). Unsurprisingly, critical assessments have followed. Hussein Dia, professor of transport technology and sustainability, argues that meeting the national target would require rapid, economy-wide transformation. He emphasises transport — Australia’s third-largest and fastest-growing source of emissions — as pivotal and persistently hard to decarbonise. Australia’s track record on carbon capture remains weak, and shifting heavy road freight to hydrogen appears inefficient relative to battery-electric options given current technologies and energy-efficiency differentials. Even where technologies are viable, the political economy is contested: prospective winners and losers shape the terrain.

2. Beneficiaries in politics. Politicians who championed climate policy early gained moral authority and media dominance. Criticism was often dismissed as immoral or “anti-science”, even though it was clear from the start that climate protection could only work globally, not merely nationally. At the same time, subsidies and levies expanded government revenue and offered room for patronage. Climate protection became a platform for redistribution and client politics.

3. New sources of money. Early climate measures and promises created immediate business opportunities. It is estimated that the electricity sector would require an estimated A$142 billion in capital investment to cover the essential electricity infrastructure by 2050. Subsidies for wind and solar, along with government contracts, fuelled new industries that profited from the money. Other companies thrived on selling “sustainable” products, consulting and certification services. Australia’s multibillion-dollar renewable energy subsidies have produced fortunes for a few, while leaving ordinary households with constantly mounting bills.

4. Bureaucracy loves regulation. Each new climate initiative generated tasks for departments, agencies, and regulators. As mandates and compliance regimes multiplied, Australia’s dual layers of Commonwealth and state authority made duplication and jurisdictional overlap more likely, driving up administrative complexity and costs.

5. Scapegoating. Climate change provided a convenient excuse for national policy failures. In developing nations, poverty could be blamed on global warming rather than corruption or poor governance. In industrialised countries, infrastructure shortcomings and poor preparation for natural disasters were often justified as consequences of a changing climate. Following floods or bushfires, leaders often face pressure to “do something,” a classic action bias in behavioural economics, and the attribution question — “was this climate change?” — can crowd out harder discussions about planning, land use and hazard management. In Australia, national leaders also faced backlash during the 2019 bushfire crisis for declining to engage substantively with climate questions. Globally, climate change can function as an easy scapegoat precisely because the systemic challenges in planning, land use and risk management are less visible, harder to narrate and slower to fix.

6. Passing on costs. Climate-related regulations introduced over time raised costs for companies, but because their competitors nationally and in several Western countries faced the same or similar regulations, those costs were passed on to consumers. In some cases, firms even profited. Europe’s emissions trading system, with free allocations of permits, allowed certain industries to earn windfalls. In Australia, the Safeguard Mechanism (from 2016) and renewable obligations can produce analogous dynamics, where consumers shoulder the costs and industries find ways to profit.

The turn: Why climate policy is losing steam

Now, however, the underlying economic logic is reasserting itself: genuine climate protection to reduce global warming would require effective global cooperation. But, this global cooperation has failed to materialise in practice, even though many climate treaties have been signed and numerous climate conferences have been held. After years of political grandstanding, ambitious policy targets, and vast amounts of subsidies, the climate issue is now losing its appeal. Six developments explain why “peak climate policy” has likely already passed.

1. The return to cost-benefit realism. More than 30 years after the Kyoto Protocol, the politically set climate targets are drawing nearer, and the costs of compliance are rising rapidly. Moralising slogans are giving way to more sober cost-benefit analysis. Many citizens are noticing how inefficient and expensive past strategies have been and how little they have contributed to slowing climate change.

2. Competition from other pressing issues. As the climate discourse loses its “monopoly” in public discourse, other priorities take centre stage: aging populations, pension security, and defence spending in an unstable geopolitical world. The fact is: A dollar cannot be spent twice. In Australia, billions for renewable subsidies will compete with other funding, such as defence, in a shifting Indo-Pacific security environment. The war in Ukraine has quickly shifted political and public opinion to the view that defence is, in the short run, a larger priority than climate change. Worldwide, the climate-adaptation and mitigation policies have substantially dropped since 2023.

3. Everything is relative. Climate damages can look frightening in absolute terms. But relative to growing economic output, they are relatively modest. Sound economic policy that generates decent growth rates has the potential to offset much of the negative impact of climate change. Recent cross-country evidence (147 countries over more than two decades) published in Humanities and Social Sciences Communications (Nature portfolio) reports an environmental-Kuznets-type pattern: as incomes rise, environmental pressures tend to intensify initially and then diminish. This does not trivialise severe local impacts or distributional inequities; it underscores that growth, technological progress and strong institutions expand adaptive capacity, even as targeted support is needed for the most exposed communities.

4. A change of perspective. Knowledge about climate change and climate science has advanced. People recognise that the 1.5°C “target” of the Paris Agreement is unrealistic; in fact, it has always been unrealistic from a socio-economic perspective. Similarly, the reference point against which global warming is measured, namely pre-industrial temperatures, is more symbolic than practical. They also understand that today’s especially rich societies have far greater capacity to cope with change than in 1850.

5. Adaptation instead of prevention. Since large-scale global emissions cuts remain unlikely in the near future, adaptation is moving to the forefront of the debate. Unlike distant promises of prevention, adaptation delivers immediate, tangible benefits. Investments in infrastructure, cooling technologies, water management, and urban design are visible, practical, and often cost-effective. In Australia, measures such as risk-appropriate zoning, fuel management, and improved land use likely deliver greater near-term payoff than symbolic targets. Likewise, air conditioning — long treated as almost taboo in parts of Europe, such as Germany — is increasingly recognised as a straightforward way to reduce heat stress. Americans, of course, have understood this for decades.

6. Climate technologies. New approaches, such as carbon removal or geo-engineering (e.g., rock weathering), are drawing growing attention. Their complexity brings “known unknowns,” such as potential effects on the global water cycle and other Earth-system feedbacks, but support for model-based research and robust governance frameworks is increasing, and complex-systems modelling will improve over time. Politically, the prospect of technological breakthroughs can be attractive because it signals progress without immediate economy-wide sacrifices, which in turn can dampen appetite for conventional mitigation focused on emissions cuts. or Australia, with strong research capacity, these technologies may represent an opportunity — provided they are pursued with rigorous evaluation, transparent risk management and international coordination.

Toward rational policy

Thus, global climate protection, until recently cast as humanity’s defining task, is increasingly giving way to approaches that are more realistic, tangible, and enforceable. The key question is whether a better economic design is available.

The answer is yes: through efficient cost transparency. Every country could adopt a universal CO₂ price. Such a mechanism would create the right incentives for producers and consumers without relying on subsidies, mandates, or complex regulations. The revenues should be fully returned to citizens — for example, via tax reductions on labour or consumption. This approach would be more efficient and more socially acceptable. The burden of a universal carbon price would be far lower than today’s labyrinth of subsidies and levies. Internationally, a simple and universal mechanism offers the best chance for effective cooperation.

Yet a CO₂ price that displaces subsidies and regulations deprives politicians, bureaucrats, and favoured industries of their privileges. The welfare-enhancing path remains blocked — not by economic logic, but by political incentives.

A mature approach

Climate change is real. But the politics of climate change — often marked by apocalyptic rhetoric, moral posturing, and costly symbolism — appears to have peaked. The experiences show both zeal and flaws: contested projections, generous subsidies, and rising household costs. Around the world, voters are beginning to ask harder questions, weighing real trade-offs, and prioritising issues closer to home.

What lies ahead is not the end of climate policy, but its transformation: fewer exaggerations and grand promises, more emphasis on adaptation and proven technologies, and potentially a shift toward economic and behavioural rationality via transparent, economy-wide pricing of emissions. Welcoming this shift is not cynicism; it is policy maturity — the recognition that effective climate action is less about headlines and more about solving problems efficiently, transparently and fairly.",https://www.themandarin.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/10/Murray-Watt-1.jpg?quality=70&w=1024,N,,2025-10-27 01:58:14.977950

,EPA,2025-10-27 04:00:24+00:00,Coastal Review,Opponents urge EPA to uphold objection to Asheboro permit | Coastal Review,Trista Talton,,,,,https://coastalreview.org/2025/10/opponents-urge-epa-to-uphold-objection-to-asheboro-permit/,"“Frankly I’m embarrassed that Asheboro is polluting the drinking water of as many as 900,000 people who live downstream from us,” longtime Asheboro resident Susie Scott said.
“1,4-dioxane is a synthetic, highly mobile compound that resists natural degradation and conventional water treatment.
Once it enters our watershed, it is persistent and travels far downstream, all the way to our drinking water intakes.
Removing 1,4-dioxane from our drinking water requires advanced and very costly treatment technologies.
The EPA may reaffirm its objection to the permit, require that the state modify the permit, or withdraw its objection of the permit.","North Carolinians from cities, towns and communities throughout the Cape Fear River Basin urged the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to uphold its objection to a municipal wastewater treatment plant’s proposed permit that excludes an effluent discharge limit for 1,4-dioxane into their drinking water sources.

One after another, speakers at a public hearing the EPA hosted last Wednesday night asked the agency to force the state to reissue a permit that will limit discharges of the likely human carcinogen into surface waters that flow into tributaries of the Haw and Deep rivers, which converge to form the Cape Fear River.

Residents from Wilmington northwest to Fayetteville, Sanford, Pittsboro, Siler City, and Asheboro joined representatives of environmental organizations and downstream public water utilities at the hearing at Randolph Community College in Asheboro, the very city that fought to get 1,4-dioxane limits removed from its permit.

“Frankly I’m embarrassed that Asheboro is polluting the drinking water of as many as 900,000 people who live downstream from us,” longtime Asheboro resident Susie Scott said. “The solution, to me, seems simple. Our city should hold the companies producing this pollution to account and insist that they clean up their waste before we accept it into our treatment plant. People living downstream from us deserve safe drinking water.”

In August 2023, the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality’s Division of Water Resources issued Asheboro a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System, or NPDES, permit limiting the city water treatment plant’s release of 1,4-dioxane.

The city sued, challenging the state’s power to include a water quality standard for the clear, odorless chemical solvent used in manufacturing processes.

In September 2024, the Chief Administrative Law Judge for North Carolina at the time, Donald van der Vaart, ruled in the city’s favor and revoked permit limits of 1,4-dioxane.

In his ruling, van der Vaart said that DEQ officials did not follow the letter of the law written in state statutes when they calculated discharge limits and established an enforceable water quality standard for 1,4-dixoane. He also noted anticipated high costs associated with monitoring and treatment of the chemical compound.

DEQ’s appeal of that ruling is pending in Wake County Superior Court.

Costs to treat 1,4-dioxane will fall on the backs of downstream water utilities customers if the pollutant is not controlled at the source, Cape Fear Public Utility Authority Executive Director Kenneth Waldroup said.

“The presence of 1,4-dioxane in our source water is just the latest example of how gaps in regulation can lead downstream communities exposed to risk,” he said. “1,4-dioxane is a synthetic, highly mobile compound that resists natural degradation and conventional water treatment. Once it enters our watershed, it is persistent and travels far downstream, all the way to our drinking water intakes. Removing 1,4-dioxane from our drinking water requires advanced and very costly treatment technologies. We’re talking millions of dollars in systems and additional millions in operations costs over a period of time.”

Waldroup said DEQ “took appropriate action” when it included 1,4-dioxane limits in Asheboro’s NPDES permit, but that the state Office of Administrative Hearings “inappropriately and inaccurately invalidated that move.”

“EPA is obligated to assume permitting authority if the state fails to comply with federal permits, and EPA must require the state of North Carolina to address this pollutant and protect 900,000 downstream users,” he said.

Public water utilities, including CFPUA, and businesses downstream of Asheboro’s wastewater treatment plant were notified by DEQ last January that the plant had discharged substantially high concentrations of 1,4-dioxane into Hasketts Creek, which empties into the Deep River.

Misty Manning, Fayetteville Public Works Commission’s chief operations officer for water resources, recalled to EPA officials last week of the Jan. 24 sampling results reported by the state and Asheboro.

“Asheboro’s own sampling result from that day was 3,520 parts per billion. This is more than 10 times higher than EPA’s calculation of what Asheboro’s discharge should be to protect public health at 22 parts per billion. Without enforceable limits, the city of Asheboro’s pretreatment program has yet to be successful in limiting 1,4-dioxane discharges to levels that meet water quality goals for a pollutant with a reasonable potential to cause or contribute to an excursion above state water quality standards,” Manning said.

She was one of several speakers at the hearing to point out that other municipalities in the state have successfully reduced 1,4-dioxane discharges through industrial pretreatment processes without bearing economic hardship.

“And Asheboro has the responsibility to do likewise, using its permitted authority over their local industrial users,” Manning said. “Downstream communities should not bear the financial burden of treating and removing pollutants introduced by unchecked upstream discharges.”

Last June, the Southern Environmental Law Center filed a lawsuit on behalf of Cape Fear River Watch and Haw River Assembly against Asheboro and the city’s industrial customer StarPet Inc., to stop their discharges of 1,4-dioxane into the Cape Fear River basin.

“As part of its antiregulatory fight, Asheboro has raised the absurd argument that it should not be the one that has to pay to control the cancer-causing pollution that it dumps upstream of drinking water supplies,” SELC attorney Hannah Nelson said. “I want to be clear. Asheboro could stop this pollution today by requiring its industries to treat for 1,4-dioxane, but it has chosen not to. In making that choice, Asheboro forces us, the families, the drinking water utilities, the local businesses, the schools, all of those who live downstream of the city, choose us to have to pay for their pollution.”

Stephen Bell, an attorney with Cranfill Sumer law firm’s Wilmington office and outside counsel for Asheboro, said that the city he represents believes steps DEQ took in implementing the August 2023 permit “set dangerous precedent with far-reaching implications.”

“Asheboro is not asking for no water regulation. They’re asking for regulation in accordance with the state law. As it stands today, based upon the court’s ruling, there is no water quality standard for 1,4-dioxane. The courts, our environmental rulemaking agency, they’re currently addressing this issue of limits for 1,4-dioxane and the EPA should respect that state-level process,” he said.

Once everyone at the hearing who signed up to speak addressed EPA officials, a member of the audience asked when the agency expects to make a final determination on the permit. The EPA may reaffirm its objection to the permit, require that the state modify the permit, or withdraw its objection of the permit.

Paul Schwartz, associate regional counsel in the Water Law Office at EPA’s Atlanta region office, said there is no statutory or regulatory timeline in which the agency must decide.

“In terms of specifying a date, certain that it would be done by, I don’t think we can do that,” he said. “And it doesn’t make it any easier that we’re operating during a period of government shutdown. But I think we want to give it immediate attention and focus on it so it doesn’t drag on too long.”

If the EPA decides to reaffirm its objection or require the permit to be modified, DEQ will have 30 days to submit a revised draft permit to the agency. If DEQ does not do that, the EPA will become the permitting authority.

Outcomes of Recent Multilateral Meetings Relevant for the Environment

Last week, multilateralism was revived with key outcomes achieved at various intergovernmental decision-making meetings held in Geneva:

The Extraordinary Session of the World Meteorological Congress was held to accelerate and expand the global Early Warnings for All (EW4All) initiative, along with other urgent strategic priorities that cannot wait until the next regular Congress in 2027. At the session:

WMO Secretary-General Celeste Saulo launched a Call to Action on Accelerating the Implementation of the Early Warnings for All Initiative and a new report Early Warnings for All in Focus: Hazard Monitoring and Forecasting, tracking global progress and gaps in the detection, monitoring, forecasting and warning across the hydrometeorological value chain, including for hazards such as tropical storms, floods, sand and dust storms and extreme heat. → WMO Press Release

WMO, together with the Global Water Partnership (GWP), officially launched the Community of Practice (CoP) on Flood Forecasting , a collaborative space for professionals working on flood forecasting, warning, and early action. It strengthens flood early warning systems and helps deliver timely, actionable information to people at risk. → Join the CoP

WMO adopted the first WMO Youth Action Plan, marking a structured approach to integrating youth perspectives into its work and empowering the next generation of leaders. Immediate priorities include establishing a WMO Youth Network, expanding training opportunities and mentorships, and amplifying youth-led storytelling and communication initiatives.

The World Meteorological Congress endorsed actions to promote Artificial Intelligence for forecasts and warnings. Congress approved a new set of technical regulations concerning early warning services and issued a “call to all stakeholders” to collaborate on the development of AI/machine learning environmental monitoring and prediction technologies, tools and applications.

WMO’s Executive Council, held back-to-back to the Congress, confirmed a total budget of 138.7 million for the biennium 2026/2027 and agreed to the terms of reference and composition of the task force, which will identify proposals for realignment of WMO’s Strategic and Operating Plans during the 2026–2027 biennium.

How microplastic pollution is boosting antimicrobial resistance | GAVI | 17 October 2025

Plastics could play a role in driving the development and transmission of AMR throughout their entire life-cycle, a new report warns. During the extraction of raw materials for the fossil fuel industry – including crude oil, natural gas and coal – biocides are used to prevent bacteria from colonising pipelines and equipment carrying oil or mining fluids. These chemicals may be inadvertently released into the environment, fuelling AMR in spill-affected areas. Exposure of microbes to sub-lethal concentrations of biocides can trigger the emergence of resistance and the sharing of resistance genes within biofilm communities.

The Environmental Protection Agency established comprehensive air quality standards in May 2024, creating stringent requirements for copper smelting operations nationwide. These regulations targeted hazardous emissions that posed significant health risks to surrounding communities, mandating substantial reductions in toxic pollutants including lead, arsenic, mercury, benzene, and dioxins.

Industry analysts projected implementation costs ranging from $200-500 million per facility, depending on existing infrastructure and required technological upgrades. The original framework provided a three-year compliance window, with smelters required to install advanced emission control systems by 2027.

Key Pollutants Targeted by the Original Standards

The 2024 rule addressed five primary hazardous air pollutants with documented links to severe health complications:

• Lead exposure – Associated with neurological damage and developmental delays in children

• Arsenic emissions – Linked to increased cancer risk and cardiovascular disease

• Mercury releases – Causes brain and nervous system damage

• Benzene compounds – Connected to leukemia and blood disorders

• Dioxin contamination – Associated with cancer and reproductive system issues

The regulation represented an update to National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants under Clean Air Act Section 112 authority, specifically targeting the limited domestic copper processing infrastructure.

Implementation Timeline and Compliance Expectations

The original regulatory framework established clear milestones for industry compliance:

2024-2025: Initial assessment and planning phase

2025-2026: Technology procurement and installation preparation

2026-2027: Full system deployment and testing

2027: Complete compliance achievement

Furthermore, specific reduction percentages for each pollutant were established in official EPA documentation from May 2024, providing clear targets for industry compliance.

What Prompted Trump's Executive Reversal Decision?

President Trump announced the Trump copper smelter emissions rule reversal on October 24, 2025, citing national security concerns and industrial competitiveness as primary justifications. The Trump executive order granted a two-year compliance exemption, arguing that stringent environmental standards threatened America's already constrained domestic copper processing capacity.

National Security Implications of Copper Production

The proclamation emphasised copper's designation as a critical material essential for multiple strategic sectors:

• Defence infrastructure and military equipment manufacturing

• Electric vehicle production and battery technology

• Renewable energy systems including solar panels and wind turbines

• Advanced telecommunications networks and data infrastructure

• Grid modernisation for distributed energy resources

According to the White House statement, imposing environmental requirements on such limited domestic industry risked accelerating facility closures, weakening the nation's industrial base, undermining mineral independence, and increasing reliance on foreign-controlled processing capacity.

Economic Justifications for Regulatory Relief

The Trump administration highlighted several economic factors supporting the regulatory exemption:

Limited Domestic Capacity: Only two operational copper smelters remain in the United States, representing the entirety of primary copper processing capability.

Technology Availability Concerns: Required emission control systems were characterised as lacking commercial viability within the original timeline.

Compliance Cost Burden: Implementation expenses could potentially force facility closures, eliminating domestic processing capacity entirely.

Foreign Dependency Risks: Increased reliance on Chinese-controlled processing capacity posed strategic vulnerabilities.

Industrial Base Protection: Preserving critical manufacturing capabilities took precedence over environmental timeline adherence.

Section 232 Investigation Connection

The copper smelter exemption built upon earlier Section 232 trade actions implemented in 2025. Following a national security investigation, the administration imposed Trump tariffs on copper stocks including a 50% tariff on certain imported copper products and mandated increasing percentages of high-quality scrap copper produced domestically be sold within US markets.

These coordinated policies demonstrated a comprehensive approach to reshoring copper processing capacity through both trade measures and regulatory relief. Moreover, the Trump tariffs economic impact extends beyond copper to influence broader industrial strategy.

Which Copper Facilities Are Affected by This Policy Change?

The regulatory exemption directly impacts America's remaining copper smelting infrastructure, representing critical industrial assets for domestic mineral processing.

Freeport-McMoRan's Arizona Operations

Freeport-McMoRan operates the nation's largest copper smelter in Miami, Arizona, processing approximately 400,000 tonnes of copper annually. The Phoenix-based company directly benefits from the two-year compliance exemption, providing operational certainty during regulatory uncertainty.

Company representatives expressed gratitude for the exemption, stating it acknowledges operational realities facing domestic copper smelting and provides needed time to assess and plan for appropriate regulatory reconsideration of the Copper Rule and future implementation.

Rio Tinto's Utah Kennecott Smelter

Rio Tinto's Kennecott operation in Utah processes roughly 300,000 tonnes annually but remains unaffected by the original 2024 regulations due to previous environmental investments. The company invested significantly in emission capture technology, achieving compliance ahead of the original timeline.

Rio Tinto emphasised their long-standing commitment to reducing environmental footprint through innovation and investment, highlighting equipment that captures emissions as the basis for regulatory compliance.

Facility Owner Location Annual Capacity Exemption Status Miami Smelter Freeport-McMoRan Arizona 400,000 tonnes Exempt Kennecott Smelter Rio Tinto Utah 300,000 tonnes Compliant

Combined US Processing Capacity

These two facilities represent approximately 700,000 tonnes of annual domestic copper processing capacity, highlighting the strategic importance of maintaining operational continuity in this limited industrial base.

How Does This Impact America's Copper Supply Chain Security?

The regulatory reversal reflects broader concerns about mineral independence and supply chain resilience, particularly given China's dominance in global copper processing markets and projected demand increases from clean energy transitions.

Global Copper Smelting Landscape

China controls approximately 50% of worldwide copper smelting capacity, creating strategic vulnerabilities for nations dependent on copper imports. The United States processes less than 5% of global copper despite significant domestic mining operations.

The US produces approximately 1.2 million tonnes of copper concentrate annually but can only process 700,000 tonnes domestically, requiring exports to foreign smelters for final processing of roughly 500,000 tonnes or 41% of domestic production.

Strategic Implications for Clean Energy Transition

Copper price insights indicate a 70% increase in demand by 2030 due to electrification trends and renewable energy deployment. This surge reflects multiple technological shifts:

• Electric Vehicle Manufacturing: Each EV requires 180-400 pounds of copper compared to 50 pounds in traditional vehicles

• Renewable Energy Infrastructure: Solar panels, wind turbines, and grid modernisation require substantial copper inputs

• Charging Infrastructure: EV charging networks demand extensive copper wiring and components

• Grid Integration: Distributed energy resources require upgraded transmission and distribution systems

Supply Chain Vulnerability Assessment

The structural deficit in domestic processing capacity creates several strategic risks:

Processing Dependency: 41% of US copper concentrate requires foreign processing

Geographic Concentration: China's 50% market share creates single-point-of-failure risks

Technology Transfer: Foreign processing potentially involves intellectual property exposure

Price Volatility: Limited domestic capacity reduces negotiating leverage in global markets

Security of Supply: Geopolitical tensions could disrupt processing access

What Are the Environmental and Health Consequences?

Environmental advocates express significant concern that the Trump copper smelter emissions rule reversal delays critical public health protections, particularly for communities surrounding copper smelting facilities where residents face continued exposure to hazardous emissions.

Air Quality Impact Assessment

The two-year compliance exemption maintains current emission levels rather than implementing the substantial reductions mandated under the original rule:

• Continued Carcinogenic Emissions: Lead, arsenic, and benzene releases persist at current levels

• Delayed Technology Implementation: Advanced emission control systems remain uninstalled

• Extended Community Exposure: Residential areas near smelters continue experiencing current pollution levels

• Postponed Air Quality Improvements: Regional atmospheric conditions show no immediate improvement

Community Health Considerations

Historical data indicates elevated rates of respiratory illness, cardiovascular disease, and developmental disorders in areas surrounding copper smelters. The exemption extends these exposure patterns for an additional 24 months beyond the original compliance timeline.

Affected Population Areas:

• Miami, Arizona: Communities surrounding the Freeport-McMoRan facility

• Utah Region: Areas near the Rio Tinto Kennecott smelter (though this facility achieved compliance)

Health Impact Valuation

According to Reuters reporting, the exemption period maintains exposure to substances with documented health effects, including neurological damage from lead exposure, cancer risks from arsenic and benzene, and reproductive system impacts from dioxin contamination.

Specific epidemiological studies and health outcome data for these communities require verification through CDC, EPA, or state health department publications to provide accurate baseline health metrics and projected impacts of the compliance delay.

How Do Industry Stakeholders View This Regulatory Change?

The copper industry generally welcomed the exemption while environmental groups criticised the prioritisation of economic concerns over public health protections, creating distinct perspectives on the regulatory balance.

Mining Industry Perspective

Industry representatives argue the original three-year timeline was unrealistic given technological limitations and capital requirements. Key industry positions include:

Technology Feasibility Concerns: Available emission control systems lacked commercial viability within the proposed timeframe.

Capital Investment Constraints: Implementation costs ranging from $200-500 million per facility posed significant financial burdens.

Closure Risk Assessment: Regulatory compliance costs could force facility shutdowns, eliminating domestic processing capacity entirely.

Strategic Security Arguments: Complete reliance on foreign operations would compromise national security interests.

Company-Specific Responses

Freeport-McMoRan thanked the Trump administration, characterising the exemption as acknowledging operational realities facing domestic copper smelting while providing needed time for regulatory reconsideration and future implementation planning.

Rio Tinto emphasised their commitment to reducing environmental footprint through innovation and investment, noting their Utah operation's compliance due to previous emission capture equipment investments.

Environmental Group Response

Environmental organisations contend the reversal undermines EPA authority and delays necessary health protections. Their primary arguments include:

• Regulatory Authority Erosion: Presidential exemptions weaken environmental agency effectiveness

• Public Health Prioritisation: Economic considerations should not supersede community health protections

• Technology Availability: Emission control solutions exist but require regulatory pressure for implementation

• Environmental Justice: Communities near smelters disproportionately bear health risks

What Happens During the Two-Year Exemption Period?

The exemption provides breathing room for industry and regulators to develop feasible compliance pathways while maintaining domestic smelting operations, creating opportunities for technological innovation and regulatory reassessment.

Technology Development Timeline

Expected developments during the 2025-2027 exemption period include:

Q1 2026: Formation of industry-EPA working groups to assess technological feasibility and alternative compliance pathways.

Q2 2026: Comprehensive technology feasibility assessments examining available emission control systems and their commercial viability.

Q3 2026: Implementation of pilot programmes testing emission reduction technologies at operational scales.

Q4 2026: Updated cost-benefit analyses incorporating technological developments and economic impacts.

2027: Proposal of revised regulatory framework balancing environmental protection with industrial competitiveness.

Investment and Innovation Opportunities

The delay period may encourage private sector investment in emission control technologies, potentially creating more cost-effective solutions than those available during original rule development. In addition, copper investment strategies may evolve to account for regulatory changes.

Technology Innovation Areas:

• Advanced filtration systems for particulate matter control

• Chemical scrubbing technologies for gaseous pollutant removal

• Process modification techniques reducing emission generation

• Monitoring and control systems for real-time emission management

• Energy recovery systems offsetting compliance costs

Regulatory Reassessment Process

The exemption period allows comprehensive evaluation of:

Technical Feasibility: Actual availability and performance of emission control technologies

Economic Impact: Precise compliance costs and their effect on facility viability

Alternative Approaches: Graduated compliance timelines or performance-based standards

International Best Practices: Emission control strategies employed by other copper-producing nations

Technology Development: Emerging solutions that may reduce compliance costs or improve effectiveness

What Are the Broader Implications for Mining Regulation?

This regulatory reversal signals a shift toward balancing environmental protection with industrial competitiveness, potentially influencing future mining and processing regulations across critical mineral supply chains.

Precedent for Critical Mineral Industries

The copper smelter exemption establishes a framework for addressing regulatory challenges across critical mineral supply chains, particularly where domestic processing capacity is limited and national security implications exist.

Potential Applications:

• Lithium Processing: Domestic battery-grade lithium production faces similar capacity constraints

• Rare Earth Element Refining: Limited US rare earth processing creates foreign dependency

• Battery Metal Processing: Nickel, cobalt, and manganese processing capacity remains underdeveloped domestically

• Uranium Enrichment: Nuclear fuel processing involves both environmental and security considerations

Future Regulatory Approach

The Trump administration's approach suggests prioritising domestic production capacity preservation while seeking technological solutions that balance environmental and economic objectives.

Key Regulatory Principles:

National Security Integration: Environmental regulations evaluated through security impact assessments.

Industrial Base Protection: Regulatory timelines adjusted to prevent facility closures in critical sectors.

Technology Development Support: Exemption periods used to advance emission control innovation.

Graduated Implementation: Phased compliance timelines based on technological and economic feasibility.

International Competitiveness: Regulatory costs balanced against global market positioning.

Legislative and Regulatory Implications

This precedent may influence Congressional approaches to environmental regulation, particularly regarding critical minerals designated under various strategic initiatives. Future legislation might incorporate explicit national security exemptions or alternative compliance pathways for strategically important industries.

Potential Policy Developments:

• Critical Minerals List Updates: Expanded designation of materials subject to security-based regulatory relief

• Alternative Compliance Mechanisms: Performance-based standards rather than technology-specific requirements

• Technology Development Incentives: Federal support for emission control innovation in strategic sectors

• International Coordination: Cooperative approaches with allies to maintain environmental standards while preserving strategic capabilities

Conclusion: Balancing Security and Environmental Protection

Trump's copper smelter emissions rule reversal reflects complex tradeoffs between immediate environmental benefits and long-term strategic security considerations. The two-year exemption creates opportunity for stakeholders to develop solutions protecting both public health and domestic industrial capacity.

The decision highlights fundamental tensions between environmental protection and national security priorities, particularly in sectors with limited domestic capacity and high strategic importance. The outcome will likely establish precedents for regulating critical mineral industries, balancing environmental standards with competitive positioning in global supply chains.

Key Considerations Moving Forward:

The success of this approach depends on whether the exemption period generates meaningful technological innovations and regulatory solutions. Environmental advocates will monitor health outcomes in affected communities, while industry stakeholders will assess technological feasibility and economic viability of eventual compliance requirements.

The broader implications extend beyond copper processing to encompass America's entire critical minerals strategy, influencing how policymakers balance environmental protection with strategic industrial capacity preservation in an increasingly complex geopolitical environment.

Disclaimer: This analysis reflects policy developments as of October 2025. Future regulatory changes, technological developments, or geopolitical shifts may alter the strategic calculations underlying these decisions. Environmental and health impact assessments should be verified through official EPA, CDC, and state regulatory agency publications.

However, the traditional 9-to-5 work schedule still provides the opportunity to find essential social connections.
While forming personal connections through work helps combat isolation, employees must still maintain and strengthen those connections.
Young adults’ daily experience in the workplace should be seen as an opportunity to establish new social connections.
The 9-to-5 work schedule has long been seen as a producer of boredom, but with the right mindset, living 9-to-5 can be an adventure.","What does it mean to live a normal life? Coming out of college, the traditional goal for many was to get a well-paying job, live in a nice place and socialize with people their age. Due to the current economic struggles and social fragmentation, many in our generation are struggling to achieve this goal, experiencing loneliness and isolation. However, the traditional 9-to-5 work schedule still provides the opportunity to find essential social connections.

It is important to understand the current difficulties that young adults are facing. Chris Beevers, director of the Institute for Mental Health Research, explained the paradoxical dichotomy of modern connection.

“Young adults are more connected to other people via online methods, but at the same time report higher levels of loneliness than ever,” Beever said. “What we’re finding is that for a lot of adolescents, just having a lot of contact with friends online is not sufficient.”

Therefore, a traditional in-person work environment may be more optimal for socialization because working virtually does not provide the same personal experience.

Chemistry freshman Jesse Bridwell expressed his concerns with a fully virtual employment.

“If you’re in your home 24/7, you can box yourself in and get in a little depressive episode,” Bridwell said. “I can’t imagine it’d be too good.”

However, the workplace is not a straightforward solution to loneliness. Although the workplace does undeniably create opportunities for in-person connections, much of that is dependent on the workplace culture.

“If the culture is basically everybody goes off, works in their office, eats lunch by themselves and then they go home at the end of the day, that doesn’t really do a lot for increasing interaction,” Beevers said.

Thus, it takes an active effort to create connections amongst coworkers. Another way to establish personal connections is through shared interests.

“If you have that common interest, it’s almost like an automatic entry into a conversation,” Beevers said.

While forming personal connections through work helps combat isolation, employees must still maintain and strengthen those connections. Beevers’ research found that spontaneity may be the key to fighting off feelings of loneliness.

“We collected Bluetooth signatures, which helped us understand when they were spending time with people versus without people,” Beevers said.

With this data, Beevers’ team determined that performing a variety of activities was beneficial for one’s mental health.

“The people who reported being the least lonely were the ones spending time with the same people, but having some variety in their day-to-day living,” Beevers said.

Therefore, the solution to our current crisis of loneliness requires both routine and spontaneity. Young adults’ daily experience in the workplace should be seen as an opportunity to establish new social connections. However, to strengthen these connections, individuals should embrace novel experiences, taking chances on new activities.

When we talk about Henry Hub, we’re really talking about Sabine Pipe Line (SPL) — a small, 150-mile, 235-MMcf/d interstate system in Southern Louisiana — and the 11 pipelines that connect to it in Vermillion Parish, LA.
These include: Acadian, Columbia Gulf (CGT), Gulf South, Jefferson Island, Natural Gas Pipeline of America (NGPL), Sea Robin, Southern Natural (SONAT), Texas Gas, Transcontinental Gas Pipeline (Transco), Trunkline, and Bridgeline, an intrastate sister pipeline to Sabine.
“Evolution” was written by Sheryl Crow and appears as the first song on side two of her 12th studio album of the same name.
Sheryl Crow is an American singer, songwriter, musician and actress.","Established in the 1980s near the now-defunct Texaco Henry gas processing plant, Henry Hub has been used as the basis for domestic gas deals for decades. Since 1990, it’s also served as the delivery mechanism for the third-largest commodity futures trading instrument in the world — the CME/NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas futures contract (behind only WTI and Brent crude). We delved into the formation, evolution and rationale for the benchmark trading location in our Henry the Hub, I Am I Am blog series, and we highly recommend you revisit those blogs if you want to learn how the hub really works.

When we talk about Henry Hub, we’re really talking about Sabine Pipe Line (SPL) — a small, 150-mile, 235-MMcf/d interstate system in Southern Louisiana — and the 11 pipelines that connect to it in Vermillion Parish, LA. These include: Acadian, Columbia Gulf (CGT), Gulf South, Jefferson Island, Natural Gas Pipeline of America (NGPL), Sea Robin, Southern Natural (SONAT), Texas Gas, Transcontinental Gas Pipeline (Transco), Trunkline, and Bridgeline, an intrastate sister pipeline to Sabine. As shown in Figure 1 below, most of these interconnects are bidirectional, and all but four (Acadian, Bridgeline, Jefferson Island and Sea Robin) are large-diameter, long-haul interstate pipelines. Depending on the combination of receipt and delivery points, these interconnects total as much as 3 Bcf/d of receipt capacity inside the hub and as much as 2.6 Bcf/d of delivery capacity. (For more on pipeline flows, see RBN’s Arrow Model, which breaks Louisiana and Texas into 11 regions and creates predictions for flows based on internal supply-and-demand fundamentals and the available pipeline capacity from one region to another.)

“Evolution” was written by Sheryl Crow and appears as the first song on side two of her 12th studio album of the same name. Released as a single in January 2024, it went to #12 on the Billboard Adult Alternatives chart and #33 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Singles chart. Crow said the song is about “leaving a better world for my children and a healthier planet.” Personnel in the record were: Sheryl Crow (lead, backing vocals), Mike Elizondo (keyboards, bass, drum programming, acoustic guitar), Fred Ettringham (drums, percussion), Rob Moose (viola, violin) and Tom Morello (Digi Tech Whammy WH-1 pedal guitar solo).

The album Evolution was recorded at Phantom Studios and Old Green Barn in Nashville, as well as Multiview Studios in Los Angeles, with Mike Elizondo, Sheryl Crow and John Shanks serving as producers. Released in March 2024, it went to # 42 on the Billboard 200 Albums chart. Four singles were released from the LP.

Sheryl Crow is an American singer, songwriter, musician and actress. When singing in bands on the weekend while teaching school during the week in rural Missouri, Crow met St. Louis musician and record producer Jay Oliver. Oliver used Crow for jingles for McDonald's and Toyota. Crow relocated to Los Angeles, where she did session vocals and hooked up as a backing vocalist on Michael Jackson's Bad World Tour from 1987 to 1989. Her debut album, Tuesday Night Music Club, was released in 1993. She has released 12 studio albums, four live albums, seven compilation albums, two EPs and 56 singles. She has appeared in three motion pictures and 19 television shows. She has won three American Music Awards, two ASCAP Awards, an ACM Award, seven BMI Awards, a Billboard Music Award, a Brit Award, and nine Grammy Awards, and has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. She continues to record and tour, and released her latest single, “The New Normal,” in July.
