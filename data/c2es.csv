“Trump’s effort to manipulate government regulation to harm clean energy just isn’t enough to offset the natural advantages that clean energy has,” Democratic U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse said.
Landrieu, now with Natural Allies for a Clean Energy Future, said promoting or punishing specific energy technologies on ideological grounds is unsustainable.","There were some highs amid a lot of lows in a roller coaster year for clean energy as President Donald Trump worked to boost polluting fuels while blocking wind and solar, according to dozens of energy developers, experts and politicians.

Surveyed by The Associated Press, many described 2025 as turbulent and challenging for clean energy, though there was progress as projects connected to the electric grid. They said clean energy must continue to grow to meet skyrocketing demand for electricity to power data centers and to lower Americans’ utility bills.

Solar builder and operator Jorge Vargas said it has been “a very tough year for clean energy” as Trump often made headlines criticizing renewable energy and Republicans muscled a tax and spending cut bill through Congress in July that dramatically rolled back tax breaks for clean energy.

“There was a cooldown effect this year,” said Vargas, cofounder and CEO of Aspen Power. “Having said that, we are a resilient industry.”

Plug Power president Jose Luis Crespo said the developments — both policy recalibration and technological progress — will shape clean energy’s trajectory for years to come.

Energy policy whiplash in 2025

Much of clean energy’s fate in 2025 was driven by booster Joe Biden’s exit from the White House.

The year began with ample federal subsidies for clean energy technologies, a growing number of U.S.-based companies making parts and materials for projects and a lot of demand from states and corporations, said Tom Harper, partner at global consultant Baringa.

It ends with subsidies stripped back, a weakened supply chain, higher costs from tariffs and some customers questioning their commitment to clean energy, Harper said. He described the year as “paradigm shifting.”

Trump called wind and solar power “the scam of the century” and vowed not to approve new projects. The federal government canceled grants for hundreds of projects.

The Republicans’ tax bill reversed or steeply curtailed clean energy programs established through the Democrats’ flagship climate and health care bill in 2022. Wayne Winegarden, at the Pacific Research Institute think tank, said the time has come for alternative energy to demonstrate viability without subsidies. ( Fossil fuels also receive subsidies.)

Many energy executives said this was the most consequential policy shift. The bill reshaped the economics of clean energy projects, drove a rush to start construction before incentives expire and forced developers to reassess their strategies for acquiring parts and materials, Lennart Hinrichs said. He leads the expansion of TWAICE in the Americas, providing analytics software for battery energy storage systems.

Companies can’t make billion-dollar investments with so much policy uncertainty, said American Clean Power Association CEO Jason Grumet.

Consequently, greenhouse gas emissions will fall at a much lower rate than previously projected in the U.S., said Brian Murray, director of the Nicholas Institute for Energy, Environment and Sustainability at Duke University.

Still, solar and battery storage are booming

Solar and storage accounted for 85% of the new power added to the grid in the first nine months of the Trump administration, according to Wood Mackenzie research.

That’s because the economics remain strong, demand is high and the technologies can be deployed quickly, said Mike Hall, CEO of Anza Renewables.

Solar energy company Sol Systems said it had a record year as it brought its largest utility-scale project online and grew its business. The energy storage systems company CMBlu Energy said storage clearly stands out as a winner this year too, moving from optional to essential.

“Trump’s effort to manipulate government regulation to harm clean energy just isn’t enough to offset the natural advantages that clean energy has,” Democratic U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse said. “The direction is still all good.”

The Solar Energy Industries Association said that no matter the policies in Washington, solar and storage will grow as the backbone of the nation’s energy future.

Nuclear and geothermal had a good year, too

Democrats and Republicans have supported investing to keep nuclear reactors online, restart previously closed reactors and deploy new, advanced reactor designs. Nuclear power is a carbon-free source of electricity, though not typically labeled as green energy like other renewables.

“Who had ‘restart Three Mile Island’ on their 2025 Bingo card?” questioned Baringa partner David Shepheard. The Pennsylvania plant was the site of the nation’s worst commercial nuclear power accident, in 1979. The Energy Department is loaning $1 billion to help finance a restart.

Everyone loves nuclear, said Darrin Kayser, executive vice president at Edelman. It helps that the technology for small, modular reactors is starting to come to fruition, Kayser added.

Benton Arnett, a senior director at the Nuclear Energy Institute, said that as the need for clean, reliable power intensifies, “we will look back on the actions being taken now as laying the foundation.”

The Trump administration also supports geothermal energy, and the tax bill largely preserved geothermal tax credits. The Geothermal Rising association said technologies continue to mature and produce, making 2025 a breakthrough year.

Offshore wind had a terrible year

Momentum for offshore wind in the United States came to a grinding halt just as the industry was starting to gain traction, said Joey Lange, a senior managing director at Trio, a global sustainability and energy advisory company.

The Trump administration stopped construction on major offshore wind farms, revoked wind energy permits and paused permitting, canceled plans to use large areas of federal waters for new offshore wind development and stopped federal funding for offshore wind projects.

That has decimated the projects, developers and tech innovators, and no one in wind is raising or spending capital, said Eric Fischgrund, founder and CEO at FischTank PR. Still, Fischgrund said he remains optimistic because the world is transitioning to cleaner energy.

More clean energy needed in 2026

An energy strategy with a diverse mix of sources is the only way forward as demand grows from data centers and other sources, and as people demand affordable, reliable electricity, said former Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu. Landrieu, now with Natural Allies for a Clean Energy Future, said promoting or punishing specific energy technologies on ideological grounds is unsustainable.

Experts expect solar and battery storage to continue growing in 2026 to add a lot of power to the grid quickly and cheaply. The market will continue to ensure that most new electricity is renewable, said Amanda Levin, policy analysis director at the Natural Resources Defense Council.

Hillary Bright, executive director of Turn Forward, thinks offshore wind will still play an important role too. It is both ready and needed to help address the demand for electricity in the new year, which will become increasingly clear “to all audiences,” she said. Turn Forward advocates for offshore wind.

That skyrocketing demand “is shaking up the political calculus that drove the administration’s early policy decisions around renewables,” she said.

BlueWave CEO Sean Finnerty thinks that states, feeling the pressure to deliver affordable, reliable electricity, will increasingly drive clean energy momentum in 2026 by streamlining permitting and the process of connecting to the grid, and by reducing costs for things like permits and fees.

Ed Gunn, Lunar Energy’s vice president for revenue, said the industry has weathered tough years before.

“The fundamentals are unchanged,” Gunn said, “there is massive value in clean energy.”

The signing of the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” (OBBB Act) by President Donald Trump on 4 July marks a pivotal shift in the United States’ climate and energy trajectory.

The sweeping legislation dismantles much of the clean energy incentives established under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), while expanding support for fossil fuel activities.

The act radically alters tax credit timelines and access, setting off a rush among developers to start construction before new deadlines in 2025 and 2026.

Redwood Materials Inc., a battery recycling venture led by Tesla Inc. co-founder JB Straubel, has begun operations at a $3.5 billion factory in South Carolina that will supply badly needed critical materials.

The company has brought a system online that’s capable of recovering 20,000 metric tons of critical minerals annually, said Straubel. Initially founded to fill a gap in the electric vehicle battery supply chain, Redwood is in the midst of a broader shift in strategy as it navigates an expected slowdown in EV demand.

The pivot also comes at a time when President Donald Trump is pushing to onshore the supply chain for materials essential to US national security.

Taking into account Redwood’s existing recycling plant in Sparks, Nevada, which recovers 60,000 tons of critical minerals annually, the firm says it is now the only major domestic source of cobalt and produces as much nickel and lithium as the largest mines in the US.

The South Carolina facility isn’t operating at full capacity, and the company declined to set a ramp-up timeline. It also declined to provide a breakdown of how much of each mineral it’s recovering at the facility.

Redwood was founded in 2017 to recycle EV batteries and produce materials like cathodes and copper foils for anodes. The company had said in 2022 that it planned to produce enough materials for a million EVs annually by 2025 and 5 million by 2030, and it had agreements with Ford Motor Co., Toyota Motor Corp. and Volvo, among others.

Yet its commercial cathode production facility in Nevada, which was slated to open in 2024 and produce 100 gigawatt-hours of battery components by this year, is still under construction with no announced opening date. While the company had planned to expand copper foil production at both of its facilities, it stopped producing it in Nevada and no longer plans to do so in South Carolina.

The industry has also faced challenges from the Trump administration, which recently canceled hundreds of millions of dollars in grants to other battery recyclers. With the administration’s attacks on EVs further impacting the industry, including winding down federal incentives in September, Redwood has increased its focus on finding other buyers. The bulk of the critical minerals the company produces are going to customers outside the EV sector, Straubel said.

“The nickel and cobalt markets are largely not driven by batteries. They’re not the biggest consumers of those particular elements,” Straubel said.

Nickel is used in stainless steel; specialty alloys, or a custom metal blend for niche applications; and industrial chemicals, while cobalt is also used in a number of high-performance alloys like those found in jet engines. While he declined to name them, Straubel said Redwood sells its critical minerals to about 20 to 30 companies, including large industrial customers using the materials in products and mining companies that process and refine them.

The company has also shifted its focus to serving data centers’ burgeoning power demand, starting a new unit this year called Redwood Energy that turns degraded EV batteries into grid-scale energy storage systems. Retired EV batteries can still work for large-scale energy storage because those systems put less strain on the hardware. In June, it unveiled a modest 63 megawatt-hour system – the equivalent of about 800 EV battery packs – paired with 12 megawatts of solar on its Nevada campus, powering a 2,000 GPU data center.

Redwood raised a $350 million Series E at a valuation of more than $6 billion last month in part to speed up energy storage deployment. That side of the business is “growing faster” and is “a new focus that we didn’t really know we were going to have a few years ago,” Straubel said.

But if an administration is defined by what it does, this White House has been anything but transparent and accessible.

In February, the Trump administration barred AP reporters and photographers from covering White House events for not obeying the president’s executive order renaming the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America. A federal court declared the banishment a violation of the organization’s free speech rights.

In September, the Department of Defense required journalists to sign a document promising not to use any material, classified or unclassified, that was not approved for publication by officials. Those who refused lost physical access to the Pentagon. A lawsuit by The New York Times claims the policy prevents “scrutiny by independent news organizations for the public benefit,” in violation of the 1st Amendment.

In December, the Inspector General for the Pentagon found that by sharing information on an unsecure messaging app about an imminent attack on Houthis in Yemen, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth risked the safety of U.S. forces. Hegseth refused to sit for an interview with Inspector General Steven Stebbins. In a written statement, Hegseth said he had a right to declassify the information but did not indicate that he had done so. A Pentagon official claimed the report constituted “a total exoneration.”

Not coincidentally, President Trump himself has broken with historic norms, by firing 17 inspectors general, leaving 75 percent of presidentially appointed inspector general positions vacant, and blocking funds appropriated by Congress for the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency. The administration, which has been slow to respond to Freedom of Information requests, is apparently about to impose a rule ending long-standing legal protection for whistleblowers employed by the federal government.

Meanwhile, the American Civil Liberties Union sued the Department of Justice to release Office of Legal Counsel documents arguing that airstrikes on alleged drug smugglers are legal. “Prompt disclosure of these records,” the plaintiffs assert, “is critically important to ensuring informed public disclosure about the U.S. military’s unprecedented strikes.”

Legal experts, Republicans and Democrats in Congress, and some U.S. military personnel have expressed concerns that drug trafficking doesn’t meet accepted definitions of threats to national security, armed conflict or foreign terrorism. Smugglers haven’t attacked U.S. citizens, have due process rights, and aren’t subject to a death penalty; the alleged list of targets reportedly includes cartels not heretofore designated as terrorist organizations; and most drugs enter the United States through Mexico. Because the U.S. is not in an armed conflict with drug traffickers, critics believe the strikes constitute “extrajudicial killings” — or, more simply, murder.

Nonetheless, the Pentagon has rebuffed requests from members of Congress to review the OLC opinion. The Constitution, U.S. Army general counsel Charles Young maintains, gives the president discretion over releasing information. Young didn’t explain why Trump didn’t exercise that discretion as part of his commitment to transparency.

Asked whether he supported releasing the unedited video of the second strike on a boat that killed two shipwrecked survivors on Sept. 2, Trump replied, “I don’t know what they have, but whatever they have, we’d certainly release, no problem.” A few days later, he asserted, “I didn’t say that. That is ABC fake news.” He then attacked the “obnoxious” reporter who asked him about it. This week, Secretary Hegseth said he would not publicly release the full video.

We have seen this movie before. As he pleaded for the administration to be “as transparent as possible” on the airstrikes, Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) made the connection explicit: “We’ve got to release the video. Look, we [also] have to get the Epstein files released.”

Asked in June 2024 whether he would declassify the controversial Epstein files if re-elected as president, Trump, who knew that MAGA influencers including Elon Musk, Laura Loomer, Alex Jones and Kash Patel were leading the charge, said “yeah, yeah, I would.” In September, he repeated, “I’d do the Epstein. I’d have no problem with it.”

In February 2025, Attorney General Pam Bondi declared Epstein files were “sitting on my desk right now to review. That’s been a directive by President Trump.” She then released “the first phase” of documents, most of them already in the public domain.

Trump then changed his mind. Bondi said there was “no client list.” Fake news networks, Democrats and “soft and foolish Republicans,” the president claimed, were focusing on “this creep” to undermine his agenda.

The files , he said, “were made up by Comey. They were made up by Obama. They were made up by Biden.” The FBI should investigate other things, like voter fraud, and “not waste Time and Energy on Jeffrey Epstein.” A lot of people “could be mentioned in those files that don’t deserve to be,” Trump said. While insisting, “I don’t care about it, released or not,” he pressured Republicans in the House to refuse to sign or withdraw their names from a discharge petition requiring a vote on a bill compelling the Justice Department to release all the files.

When that effort failed, Trump took credit for telling Republicans to do what they had already decided to do: “Because of this request, the votes were almost unanimous.”

“President Trump has been consistently calling for transparency related to the Epstein files for years,” a White House spokesperson asserted, and calling for “investigations into Epstein’s Democrat friends.”

Once upon a time, Trump appeared to be a born-again proponent of transparency. His lack of faith, however, has been far more frequent, long-lasting and consequential.

“Without additional investments, it becomes very difficult to build the resilient supply chain that is vital for European jobs, European prosperity and European security,” Filosa told the FT.

As Brussels continues to refine its industrial and climate agenda, the warning from one of Europe’s largest automakers points to the stakes.
For companies like Stellantis, the challenge is not only adapting to new technologies, but deciding whether Europe remains a place where long-term automotive investment makes economic and strategic sense.","Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa has issued a blunt warning that the European Union’s latest package of measures for the auto industry could undermine long-term investment in the region, deepening uncertainty for manufacturers already under pressure from weak demand, high costs, and intensifying global competition.

Speaking to the Financial Times in an interview published on Saturday, Filosa said the proposals unveiled by the European Commission earlier this week lack the urgency and coherence needed to revive growth in Europe’s automotive sector, which remains one of the bloc’s most strategically important industries.

“There are none of the urgent measures needed to return the European automotive sector to growth,” Filosa said. “Without growth, it becomes very difficult to think about investing more.”

The Commission’s plan, announced on Tuesday, includes a controversial shift on climate policy by effectively dropping the EU’s planned ban on the sale of new combustion-engine cars from 2035.

The move has exposed deep divisions within the industry and among policymakers. While some automakers and member states argue that easing the rule offers breathing space amid slowing electric vehicle adoption and infrastructure gaps, others fear it dilutes regulatory clarity and weakens Europe’s credibility in the global transition to cleaner transport.

For Stellantis, which operates 14 brands including Peugeot, Fiat, Opel, Citroën, Jeep, and Alfa Romeo, the concern goes beyond the fate of internal combustion engines. Filosa framed the issue as one of strategic certainty and industrial confidence, arguing that frequent policy shifts make it harder for companies to commit capital to European factories, suppliers, and innovation hubs.

He said that without sustained and predictable investment, Europe risks losing its ability to build a resilient automotive supply chain, something he linked directly to employment, competitiveness, and security.

“Without additional investments, it becomes very difficult to build the resilient supply chain that is vital for European jobs, European prosperity and European security,” Filosa told the FT.

In an official statement released after the Commission’s announcement, Stellantis said the proposals failed to tackle several structural challenges facing the sector. The company pointed to the absence of a clear and comprehensive roadmap for light commercial vehicles, a segment that underpins logistics, trades, and small businesses across the continent. It also criticized the lack of flexibility around the EU’s 2030 emissions targets for passenger cars, which it said do not adequately reflect market realities or consumer affordability concerns.

The criticism comes at a delicate moment for Europe’s car industry. Automakers are grappling with slowing vehicle sales, stubbornly high energy and labor costs, and fierce competition from Chinese electric vehicle manufacturers, many of which benefit from lower production costs and strong state backing. At the same time, European manufacturers are being asked to fund multiple transitions at once: electrification, software-driven vehicles, autonomous technologies, and ever-stricter environmental and safety standards.

Industry executives have repeatedly argued that regulation alone cannot drive the transition. They have called for stronger demand-side measures, including purchase incentives, accelerated deployment of charging infrastructure, and policies to lower the cost of energy and raw materials. Without such support, they warn, consumers will delay purchases and manufacturers will struggle to justify large-scale investments.

The contrast with other regions has become increasingly stark. In the United States, the Inflation Reduction Act has unlocked billions of dollars in subsidies and tax credits for electric vehicles, batteries, and clean manufacturing, attracting major investment from global automakers and suppliers. Filosa’s remarks echo a growing concern among European executives that capital could increasingly flow to markets offering clearer incentives and more stable policy frameworks.

While the Commission has argued that its revised approach aims to balance climate goals with industrial competitiveness, Stellantis’ response highlights fears that the package delivers neither decisively. Easing the 2035 combustion-engine deadline may reduce near-term pressure, but Filosa suggested that without a credible growth strategy, it risks prolonging uncertainty rather than resolving it.

Looking Toward a Sustainable Future Radiant Nuclear’s microreactors hold promise for a more sustainable energy future.","Radiant Nuclear, based in El Segundo, California, is making significant strides in the nuclear energy sector with its 1-MW microreactors. The company recently secured $300 million to advance its commercialization efforts and is planning to establish a reactor factory in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, by 2026. This facility aims to produce 50 Kaleidos microreactors annually, with shipments to customers beginning in 2028. With over half a billion dollars in funding, Radiant is positioning itself as a key player in the competitive race to deliver compact nuclear reactors, leveraging advanced technology and strategic partnerships.

Revolutionizing Energy with Microreactors

The Kaleidos microreactor represents a breakthrough in portable nuclear energy technology. Designed to be compact and highly efficient, each reactor is equipped with TRISO fuel—ceramic-coated uranium particles that ensure safety and stability by preventing meltdowns. The use of helium cooling systems further enhances the reactor’s operational safety. This innovative approach allows the reactors to adapt to varying energy demands while maintaining real-time performance monitoring.

These reactors are delivered fully assembled, fueled, and tested, ready to generate power the day after arrival. Capable of producing 1.9 MW of thermal power, they are ideal for industrial heating applications. The ability to daisy chain multiple units creates scalable power solutions for diverse settings, from remote communities to disaster areas. This flexibility makes them a viable alternative to traditional diesel generators.

Strategic Partnerships and Market Expansion

Radiant Nuclear is actively forming strategic partnerships to expand its market presence. The company recently signed an agreement to supply a US military base with a Kaleidos reactor by 2028. Additionally, a deal with Equinix, a major data center operator, will see dozens of reactors deployed to support energy-intensive facilities. These partnerships underscore the potential for microreactors to transform energy supply chains and enhance energy security.

Next year, the Kaleidos will undergo a fueled test using high-assay low-enriched uranium, marking a significant milestone as the first new commercial reactor design to be tested in the US in over five decades. Radiant’s exclusive access to this advanced fuel positions it advantageously in a competitive market. The planned demonstration at Idaho National Laboratory’s DOME research facility will further validate the reactor’s capabilities.

But as temperatures rise, this quintessential winter holiday scene is transforming (in the Northern Hemisphere at least). The snowstorm you were picturing is actually more likely to be a chilly rain in many areas. Cocoa crops around the world are failing, making chocolate drinks and desserts increasingly expensive. Global warming is even coming for Rudolph, recent research shows.

Climate change is threatening Christmas and winter traditions – and in some cases, holiday trends are fueling it.

Christmas Crops

Holiday spirit in December is underpinned by a multitude of global supply chains churning throughout the year. And I'm not just talking about markets that support presents like clothes and electronics; many of the most lucrative Christmas commodities are grown.

Take chocolate: As many as 6 million small-holder farmers in Africa, Asia and Latin America grow and harvest 90 percent of the world's cocoa, which go into all sorts of holiday classics – from yule log cakes to marshmallow-topped cocoa. Cacao, the plant that is processed to make cocoa, thrives in tropical climates with warm temperatures and abundant rainfall. But in 2023 and 2024, the weather was too warm and wet – then too dry – in African countries like Côte d'Ivoire and Ghana for healthy cacao crops. Yields plummeted to record lows.

This extreme weather was caused partially by the El Niño weather pattern. But an analysis by the nonprofit Climate Central found that human-caused climate change added six weeks' worth of days above 89 degrees Fahrenheit in 71 percent of cacao-producing areas across much of West Africa in 2024. The low output led to staggeringly high chocolate prices around the world, surging from about $2,500 to more than $10,000 per metric ton that year.

Though prices have since fallen a bit, scientists at Harvard University say this cocoa volatility likely represents a ""new normal."" Unpredictable weather is affecting other holiday baking necessities like sugarcane and cinnamon crops – both essential for any snickerdoodle fan.

Long-term temperature rise and compounding weather disasters are also hurting the most iconic holiday crop: Christmas trees. As I reported in January, Oregon and North Carolina produce the most Christmas trees in the United States, but warmer winters and longer growing seasons are leading to stunted growth and a surge in pest outbreaks that can decimate supplies.

""When we grow Christmas trees, we typically are taking them out of their natural habitat, particularly with Fraser fir,"" Justin Whitehill, a forestry researcher at North Carolina State University who studies Christmas trees, told me a year ago.

""Taking them out of their sort of natural range, we're already putting a lot of stress on them,"" and climate-fueled warming only adds to that, he added. Whitehill and other scientists – including an entire Christmas tree program at Oregon State University – are experimenting with new breeds or genetic modifications to help make the trees more resistant to pests and heat.

Pro tip: Researchers also told me that once the holiday season is over, you can donate your natural Christmas tree (after you've removed the ornaments and tinsel) to wildlife agencies around the country. They use them to help provide crucial habitats for freshwater fish.

Climate Scrooge

The subjects of some of the most famous Christmas carols are also at risk as global temperatures rise. Reindeer – also known as caribou in North America – face over a 50 percent decline by the end of the century due to climate-fueled habitat loss and overheating, according to a study published in August.

These antlered creatures thrive in Arctic habitats such as tundra and boreal forests, where they help maintain vegetation and plant diversity. Using fossils and ancient DNA, researchers simulated how warming events over the past 21,000 years affected reindeer populations to help predict how they will do in the future under different warming scenarios.

They found that modern-day rates of temperature rise could decimate reindeer populations more than any of those in the past.

""Continued losses will likely further exacerbate climatic warming through release of soil carbon to the atmosphere, which, of course, would further threaten reindeer and caribou, as well as ourselves,"" study co-author Eric Post, a professor at the University of California, Davis, said in a statement. ""For thousands of years, the well-being of our own species has benefited directly from healthy reindeer and caribou populations. Now more than ever, we need to ensure their well-being in turn.""

Meanwhile, Frosty the Snowman and the white Christmas you may be dreaming of are also disappearing amid rapid warming. The chances of having at least one inch of snow on Christmas Day – the metric for what the National Weather Service deems a ""white Christmas"" – are ""gradually decreasing across the Southern United States, and this trend is slowly moving north,"" according to the federal government. It's important to note that snow was never that common on Christmas Day for many states, Time magazine reports.

""People tend to remember that one snowy Christmas, and they forget that it was surrounded by five Christmases that weren't,"" David Robinson, New Jersey's state climatologist and a Rutgers University professor whose research focuses on snow cover, told Time.

But records reveal a clear trend of warming winters overall, with average temperatures rising nearly 4 degrees Fahrenheit in almost 250 U.S. cities since 1970, according to an analysis of federal data by Climate Central. Holiday shopping may be accelerating this trend, with millions of emissions generated each year due to product manufacturing, packaging, shipping and waste.

It doesn't end there: Roughly 15 percent of purchases made during the holiday season are returned. I reported on this ""reverse supply chain"" last year and was shocked to learn how returns' carbon pollution compares to that of the initial deliveries.",https://media.phillyvoice.com/media/images/hot_chocolate_climate.76af3cfb.fill-1200x630-c0.jpg,N,,2025-12-21 09:58:40.285290

LIMÓN INDANZA, Ecuador—Long drifts of mist settle between the mountain peaks in this region, almost indistinguishable from clouds. Underneath, species found only here depend on the intricacies of this high-altitude rainforest, one of the most biodiverse places on the planet.

Like many parts of the Amazon, this fragile and abundant wilderness is imperiled—and not only by the usual dangers of development and climate change. Mounting sovereign debt has become one of the Ecuadorian Amazon’s biggest threats, pushing the government to expand oil and mining to keep public finances afloat.

Ecuador owes $49 billion to foreign creditors and is paying billions more just to service the debt that instead could be spent on urgently needed environmental protections.

But today, an effort is underway that could transform this liability into a tool for conservation. In 2024, through a deal known as a debt-for-nature swap, the Ecuadorian government was able to refinance some of its costliest, privately held debt for pennies on the dollar and replace it with a lower-interest, longer-maturity bond. In return, Ecuador agreed to expand protections across its Amazonian region, which spans about half the country.

Debt swaps—for nature, development projects and more—are not new. Western creditors have been experimenting with versions of them since the 1980s. In recent years, countries such as Seychelles and Barbados have executed deals with private creditors like commercial banks, mobilizing hundreds of millions of dollars for conservation. Now, a small chorus of academics and policy thinkers is looking beyond traditional lenders to one with massive and untapped leverage: China.

Through its $1.3 trillion Belt and Road Initiative, Beijing has become the world’s largest bilateral creditor by financing mines, ports, power plants and infrastructure in countries across the developing world. China’s opaque lending practices make it difficult to know exactly how much these countries owe, but experts say it could exceed hundreds of billions of dollars.

Those massive figures caught the attention of economist and China expert Christoph Nedopil Wang, who was among the first researchers to see an opportunity in them. In 2021, he and his colleagues wrote a paper advancing the idea that China could help countries redirect some of that debt into conservation efforts.

China took notice. The central bank’s Green Finance Committee commissioned Nedopil Wang to do a special study on the topic, as did the United Nations Development Programme. And while Beijing has yet to do a debt-for-nature deal, it’s discussing another form of debt swap with Egypt and other increasingly sophisticated financial transactions to alleviate debt.

Rebecca Ray, an economist at Boston University who is among the pioneering thinkers on China and debt swaps, argues such new approaches are overdue. “One cyclone can wipe out multiple years of export earnings, and that kind of climate shock is making debt crises more common,” she said.

China’s Belt and Road spending spree has unlocked development funding for cash-strapped countries like Ecuador but has also left behind a trail of environmental destruction while contributing to ballooning debt burdens further strained by rising interest rates and the COVID-19 pandemic.

Today, the world’s poorest countries, many of which owe debt to China, spend twice as much servicing debt as they receive in climate funding. Unless debt burdens ease, the financial pressure on those countries could drive them toward greater resource extraction, further imperiling some of the most critical ecosystems on Earth.

Supporters of Chinese participation in debt-for-nature swaps say the model offers a way to relieve some of that burden while redirecting Beijing’s influence toward repairing the landscapes its projects damaged.

Proponents view these deals as win-wins, but some environmental economists and scholars remain deeply skeptical. They note Beijing’s reluctance to write off debt for fear of triggering demands for similar treatment from other borrowers, and say other creditors like multilateral development banks and private debt holders—which, collectively, hold the majority of most developing countries’ external debt—should be first in line to take a loss.

“China feels, from its perspective, ‘Why should we be the ones?’” said Elizabeth Losos, executive in residence at Duke University’s Nicholas Institute for Energy, Environment & Sustainability. “They don’t want to set a precedent.”

The flip side, she noted, is that China is carrying a portfolio of borrowers that aren’t able to pay back their debts on time. Many have been forced to roll over their loans, reducing the debt’s ultimate value. In that context, accepting an immediate payment rather than uncertain payments in the future—while also accruing geopolitical goodwill at a moment when the United States is retreating from climate and environmental cooperation—may be the more strategic choice, Losos said.

For now, China’s willingness to use its financial clout for conservation or other sustainable development goals remains uncertain. Even if Beijing were to embrace debt swaps more broadly, its environmental legacy across many Belt and Road countries raises doubts.

In Ecuador, Chinese firms have dammed rivers, mined mountains and drilled pristine rainforest. That track record makes it hard for many Ecuadorians to imagine China as a sudden champion of global conservation.

Julio Prieto, a Quito-based environmental lawyer, recently sued a Chinese firm over a sprawling waste pit at one of its mines. Along with civil society groups, Prieto has criticized Chinese companies for steamrolling over local objections in communities where it has built major projects. He questions China’s will to establish a complex conservation deal that would respect human rights.

“If the Chinese government and Chinese companies are not willing to be transparent about something as basic as their construction plans,” Prieto said, “I’d be surprised if they were open to taking a fundamentally different approach on debt swaps.”

Leaning In

When Nedopil Wang first contemplated a China-backed debt swap, the reaction from many China watchers at the time was dismissive: “‘OK, you’re crazy. What even is this?’” he recalled them saying.

Beijing’s interest was clearly piqued. The powerful Ministry of Commerce, responsible for overseas development assistance, conducted its own research and Chinese officials began showing up to Nedopil Wang’s presentations. Yet, what the Communist Party’s top leadership ultimately thinks of those ideas remains unknowable.

“It’s a fantastically closed system,” Nedopil Wang said.

But China’s debt-swap discussion with Egypt suggests Beijing is at least interested in testing the idea.

In 2023, the countries opened negotiations to swap some of Cairo’s $8 billion debt to China for interest-free loans financing a broad sweep of projects, including renewable energy and healthcare development. Ray calls this trial run “China’s proof of concept.”

Nedopil Wang explained that Egypt approached China and said, “Here’s an opportunity for you as a creditor to support our development through swaps.” he said the details of the deal are still unclear. “It remains to be seen how it’s going to be applied, but it seems the focus is on interest-free debt,” he added.

Negotiators rarely disclose details of debt swaps in advance because any information surrounding a possible deal could influence financial markets. But policy analysts have identified a slate of countries as strong candidates for Chinese debt restructuring.

Pakistan is a key example. China has become its largest creditor after kicking off a massive project known as the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor. One of the central pillars of the Belt and Road Initiative, it aims to secure road and water routes from western China to the Middle East and has fast-tracked the construction of seven coal-fired power plants, with another planned. Pakistan owes China just under $30 billion—more than any other country.

“Pakistan has such a high debt level where China plays such a big, big role, and there are multiple underperforming assets that make the debt payment sometimes difficult,” Nedopil Wang explained. “There’s also a huge opportunity to do … a debt-for-renewables swap in this case. So I think this is a space to watch.”

The Chinese-backed coal plants there have underperformed because of lower demand from consumers, making it more difficult for Pakistan to repay the debt. Under a debt-for-renewables swap, in theory, Pakistan and China would agree to refinance coal plants with lower interest and retire them earlier than planned with a promise by Pakistan to move toward a greater percentage of renewables to meet demand. That would reduce the risk of default for Chinese creditors, Nedopil Wang said, while accelerating Pakistan’s transition to renewable and cheaper sources of energy.

“You have loans at risk of non-performance, and a bank might want to get rid of them. Rather than having to write those loans down, a bank can get rid of them at 70 percent and thus actually make money,” Nedopil Wang said, noting that, in the case of a swap, the plants would still operate, but for a shorter period of time, providing revenue to pay back the new lower-priced debt.

An official at one of the country’s primary business lobbies recently urged the government to seek debt-for-nature swaps with China as the two countries discuss debt relief. And Aneel Salman, chair of economic security at the Islamabad Policy Research Institute, noted that the country’s new sustainable financing framework explicitly says the government could consider the swaps as part of a blended finance deal. Pakistan’s finance minister has been actively talking about debt-for-nature swaps in public addresses, he added.

“We have shown our eagerness,” Salman said.

Ray also noted that a debt swap could be used to help the flood-prone country adapt to increasingly extreme weather.

A swap in Mongolia, meanwhile, would offer an unique opportunity for reforestation along the Chinese border to mitigate the sandstorms that blow into Beijing, Nedopil Wang said.

If China does pursue these swaps, it would join a growing trend. Countries have struck at least 10 debt-for-nature deals in recent years as climate change-induced extreme weather and the pandemic worsened the debt load in lower-income countries already struggling to pay back loans. In 2024, external debt in lower-income countries hit a record high of $8.9 trillion, while around 88 percent of the world’s most endangered ecosystems lie in debt-distressed nations.

Even the most ardent proponents of swaps don’t see them as a complete fix. They won’t close the world’s $700 billion annual financing shortfall for conserving biodiversity, nor the roughly $4 trillion gap for achieving the U.N.’s sustainable development goals, including greater access to clean energy and less poverty. But advocates argue they can meaningfully chip away at these problems by converting financial distress into public benefits.

The model could be particularly promising in parts of Africa, where Chinese companies have spent the past two decades mining the minerals that power the global renewable-energy transition, said Jean-Marc Malambwe Kilolo, an economist with the U.N. Economic Commission for Africa who has advised governments on debt-swap proposals.

Many African countries want to move beyond extraction and into higher-value refining and manufacturing for technologies like electric vehicles, he said. Well-designed debt-for-development swaps could support that shift while also benefiting local communities.

With roughly 43 percent of Africans lacking access to electricity, many households rely on firewood and charcoal for cooking and heat. “People need to be incentivized not to cut trees—to preserve and conserve green spaces,” Malambwe Kilolo said. “If there is no economic benefit, then what’s the point of doing conservation?”

In Ecuador, the same needs—and incentives—could translate to conservation.

“Our Currency Is Our Biodiversity”

On a bright November afternoon, perched above the narrow streets of Cuenca, former Ecuadorian environment and foreign affairs minister Gustavo Manrique Miranda cradles a glass of red wine and lays out the philosophy that shaped his time in office.

“I really believe that we are as rich as any country in the world, but our currency is our biodiversity,” he said. “The challenge is how to create value from biodiversity while keeping it alive.”

For Manrique Miranda, debt-for-nature swaps became a way to do just that. During his tenure from 2021 to 2023 under President Guillermo Lasso, he helped engineer Ecuador’s first modern swap: reducing $1.63 billion in debt held by Credit Suisse (now UBS) to $656 million, while establishing a large marine reserve near the Galápagos Islands and a $323 million conservation fund to protect it. He then set in motion the discussions that would evolve into Ecuador’s ambitious Amazon debt swap, known as the Amazonian Biocorridor Fund.

As Manrique Miranda was negotiating those deals with bondholders, nonprofits and other Ecuadorian ministries, President Lasso was making his own appeal abroad—flying to Beijing to plead for relief from Chinese banks. Years of heavy borrowing under his predecessor, much of it backed by Ecuadorian oil, had left the country locked into continued extraction and owing more than $5 billion to China.

Lasso returned claiming a modest victory: China agreed to push back repayment deadlines and trim interest rates. Such incremental renegotiations have become a hallmark of how Beijing manages its sweeping amount of distressed debtors, reflecting the Communist Party’s generally inward-facing priorities and commercial-driven approach to lending.

Those working to bring China around to debt swaps say the appeal for creditors is twofold: They can move troubled debt off their balance sheets while securing some ready cash now. Institutions like the Inter-American Development Bank and the U.S. International Development Finance Corp. have played a pivotal role by providing political-risk insurance and other credit enhancements that de-risk the transactions—making the deals financially viable in the first place.

For nation-state creditors, the benefits extend beyond balance sheets. The swaps provide a reputational boost that can translate into political leverage down the road, all while broadcasting the creditor government’s environmental bona fides on the world stage.

Back in Cuenca, an Andean gateway to the Amazon, Manrique Miranda said that even if Beijing won’t step in as a creditor, he believes it could contribute in ways similar to the United States’ support for the Galápagos and Amazon Biocorridor deals—providing critically important political-risk insurance.

Manrique Miranda has ideas in mind, pointing to an unprotected marine zone north of the Galápagos, mangrove forests along the mainland coast and gold reserves that could remain unmined if a future deal made conservation the better option.

“China,” he said, “could be a player.”

Others who share Manrique Miranda’s cautious optimism see another factor at work: Chinese President Xi Jinping has spent recent years casting his country as a global champion of biodiversity and the architect of a new “ecological civilization.”

An Ecological Contradiction

At a global biodiversity summit hosted by China in 2021, Xi appeared on a massive video screen to unveil a bold new idea: a world where humans and nature coexist in harmony. He invoked images of panda sanctuaries and sprawling national parks where elephants and tigers roam, framing conservation as both noble and achievable.

That vision is not just rhetoric. Under Xi’s rule, the concept of an “ecological civilization” has been written into China’s constitution alongside provisions cementing his own indefinite rule. On the international stage, Xi presents himself as an environmental visionary, repeating one of his favorite slogans: “Green mountains are gold and silver mountains”—in other words, protecting nature pays.

For many outside China—especially in the United States, where conservative lawmakers invoke China as a foil to justify America’s own pollution-heavy industries—the country still conjures images of smog-choked skylines and blackened rivers. But that picture is increasingly outdated.

After decades of severe industrial pollution, Beijing has imposed some of the world’s strictest environmental regulations. It has outspent every other nation on renewable energy, built a vast corpus of environmental scientists and created national parks and protected areas on a scale larger than Yosemite and Yellowstone combined.

Over the past 40 years, China has become one of the most re-forested parts of Earth after Chinese officials ordered the planting of millions of trees to combat flooding, deforestation and the encroachment of the Gobi Desert in the northern part of the country. This effort, known as the “Great Green Wall,” has made China one of the world’s leading technical experts in “greening” land that’s been degraded or overused.

But China’s environmental turnaround within its borders has led to a growing ecological footprint abroad as the country shifts its extraction to forests, mountains and seascapes in Belt and Road Initiative partner countries.

To longtime China scholar, Judith Shapiro, this transformation is both impressive and troubling.

“There’s been real progress—air quality has improved, pollution enforcement is far stronger, and ecological restoration is happening at a scale few other countries could pull off,” she said.

“But the approach is extremely technocratic and top-down. It doesn’t involve public participation, community oversight or grassroots decision-making,” she added.

That’s a consequence, Shapiro said, of the ruling Communist Party’s authoritarian governance and control over its citizens, which has only intensified under Xi.

The human cost has been stark. One of the clearest examples is China’s “Ecological Conservation Redlines,” a sweeping system that designates large swaths of land for protection and restricts industrial and residential use. While the policy has helped revive degraded ecosystems, it has also displaced millions from rural areas into cities, creating a new class of urban poor.

“It’s a form of quiet dispossession,” said Jesse Rodenbiker, who has conducted extensive field research in rural China. “People wake up one day and find they can no longer farm the land they’ve lived on for generations.”

Despite the social costs, the Communist Party hails ecological redlining as a triumph, an efficient way to conserve land by urbanizing rural populations and giving some people residency status. The model echoes the United States’ early conservation history, when Native Americans were forcibly removed to create national parks such as Yosemite. That “fortress conservation” philosophy was later exported overseas with more devastating human-rights consequences.

As the global conservation community increasingly reckons with these legacies, Beijing is positioning elements of its model as an export. Through the Kunming Biodiversity Fund announced at the 2021 summit, China has pledged more than $230 million to help developing countries meet their biodiversity goals. Coupled with a rapidly expanding web of technical exchanges, training programs and environmental assistance, China has cultivated what scholars describe as “green soft power”—a strategy that bolsters its influence in the Global South.

“China,” Rodenbiker said, “is offering resources others aren’t.”

A Black Box

On a sun-streaked cafe patio in Quito, Prieto leaned forward in a plastic chair, the environmental lawyer’s energy unflagging after a long day of meetings. Nearby, the capital’s late-afternoon traffic snaked around colonial edifices and plazas, fusing the tang of exhaust fumes with roasting coffee beans in the high Andean air.

Prieto was eager to talk. He has spent years grappling with the consequences of extractive foreign investment in Ecuador, projects promising beneficial development but leaving rivers slick with oil, forests razed and Indigenous communities displaced. His work has included a landmark case against Chevron, whose predecessor Texaco dumped millions of gallons of toxic waste into the Amazon.

“I understand well how Western companies operate,” Prieto said, referring to the mechanisms he’s used to try to hold those firms accountable. “China, though, is a black box for us.”

Today, Prieto is president of the Quito-based Center for Economic and Social Rights (CDES), a nonprofit critical of Ecuador’s debt swaps, alleging they lacked transparency and public participation. In 2024, Prieto and CDES won concessions from the Inter-American Development Bank, a guarantor of the Galápagos transaction, to improve public access to information about the deal’s conservation fund.

Prieto has broader concerns about the deals: “They don’t help sustainability or protect nature effectively,” he said, noting that their complexity and drawn-out structure tend to generate substantial income to lawyers and administrators. He also takes issue with how communities are treated.

“In the Galápagos and now in the Amazon, Indigenous communities are often sidelined,” he added. “Only a small, select group is consulted.”

More than a million Indigenous people call Ecuador home. Many live in the Amazon and do not identify with the umbrella organizations typically brought to the negotiating table. That mismatch has long dogged both extractive and conservation efforts in Ecuador, resulting in processes that often overlook the diverse realities and consent of the communities involved.

Prieto said the lack of transparency surrounding environmental decisions in Ecuador is troubling, noting that the state-owned Chinese mining company he is currently suing has refused to release its waste pit construction plans. It cited a confidentiality clause it negotiated with the Ecuadorian government. Earlier this year another Chinese mining firm’s waste pit collapsed in Zambia, causing catastrophic destruction. Advocates there have also struggled to obtain that company’s planning documents.

Prieto worries that the details of any potential debt-for-nature deal could be similarly obscured.

According to Prieto and news reports, communities near the Amazonian mine have faced displacement, environmental contamination and other abuses, including violence against Indigenous women. “Communities feel they have no recourse,” Prieto said.

Many of those communities, academics and advocates also have ethical objections to debt-for-nature deals, which they argue has led to the “financialization of conservation”—treating nature as an asset to be priced rather than as a living system with inherent value. (Ecuador’s constitution is the only one in the world to recognize that nature, like humans, has rights to exist).

Even as China considers debt swaps for renewables or development—investments that can offer Beijing a clear financial return—tying debt relief to conservation could be a nonstarter, said Junjie Zhang, an environmental economist with Duke Kunshan University. China’s priority, he said, has always been development, not aid.

Most Chinese officials, he added, believe struggling countries must first “make a living” before tackling anything else. Debt swaps for conservation strike them as risky, even counterproductive.

“If you swap debt for nature, what about in the future? Can the country generate enough revenue? Then you again ask for money,” Zhang said.

And China, with its fiercely competitive economic culture and domestic sensitivity to giving money away, is wary of assuming the role of global green financier.

“China doesn’t want to be a leader,” he said. “A leader needs to pay.”

Yunnan Chen, a research fellow with the London-based overseas development think tank ODI Global (formerly Overseas Development Institute), pointed out that China went into debt when it pursued its own industrialization.

“It doesn’t necessarily see debt as inherently a bad thing. It sees it as a necessary phase that developing countries have to go through to make the right kinds of productive investments in order to then generate growth. And that is also why I think it’s resistant to giving that kind of concession or debt relief.”

When China extends debt relief—zero-interest loans or loan write-offs—it’s subsidized by the country’s foreign aid budget. “It’s a tiny, tiny proportion of the portfolio and it’s usually only the ones that are at the end of their maturity,” Chen said. “And it’s kind of a tick-the-box exercise for the news headline.”

Kevin Koenig, who has tracked China’s footprint in Ecuador for more than a decade, is blunt about the prospect of Beijing stepping into the conservation arena.

“I don’t want to call it greenwashing,” he said. “But if there were a real interest in biodiversity protection or debt cancellation, you’d do that differently, not: ‘We’re going to continue extraction, and on the side we’ll do a debt-for-nature deal’ very far away from the places their investment projects are destroying.”

Koenig sees the same contradictory elements in Ecuador’s existing debt-for-nature deals. They may channel money into protected areas, he said, but they don’t touch the forces driving deforestation and emissions in the first place. Even as the government celebrates the Amazonian Biocorridor debt-swap, it has continued to expand mining and approve new oil production blocks across the Amazon.

“These swaps won’t solve the fossil fuel or climate problem,” Koenig said. “They might save certain areas on paper, but they’re full of contradictions—countries promising a transition while doubling down on extraction.”

An Open Door

Since Ecuador pioneered one of the earliest debt-for-nature swaps in the late 1980s, the model for the deals has changed dramatically. After a period in which wealthy countries forgave portions of developing nations’ debt, the swaps have shifted into far more intricate, privately financed transactions. Today’s versions are vastly larger, often restructuring hundreds of millions or even more than a billion dollars in sovereign debt, and requiring layers of legal, financial and political coordination.

Ecuador’s Amazon swap, backed by The Nature Conservancy and public financial institutions, cut Ecuador’s debt obligation to some private bondholders from $1.53 billion to $730 million, while directing part of each payment into a conservation fund expected to raise $460 million over 17 years. The proceeds will go to Indigenous communities and conservation projects.

Speaking from a glassy high-rise in downtown Quito, Galo Medina, The Nature Conservancy’s Ecuador director, recalled just how arduous it was to pull off the deal. Initiated in 2022, the transaction outlasted two presidents and five environment ministers. Beyond the financial restructuring, the government codified new conservation commitments into law and, with The Nature Conservancy and other partners, established an independent trust fund to manage the money.

Medina insisted the trust fund is legally bound to fulfill conservation requirements set by the Ecuadorian government—not creditors who participated in the transaction or any other party. The fund also has to comply with Ecuadorian law, including the requirement that local communities are consulted about activities that could impact them.

The trust fund, he explained, is overseen by an independent board, including a representative from an Amazonian Indigenous organization. Once the fund is fully operational, he expects it to distribute roughly $17 million annually for conservation. The first call for proposals is expected toward the end of January.

“The main aspect that we’re looking for is the involvement and direct participation of local and Indigenous communities in the Amazon,” Medina said.

But he also acknowledged the tension at the heart of the effort—that the region the fund aims to protect is also where the government is expanding oil production and mining. His colleague, financial specialist Mónica Chávez, underscored the broader context: Developing countries would like to invest more heavily in conservation and climate commitments even as they face severe fiscal constraints.

“Then comes something like this, a debt-for-nature swap, and offers the chance for our country to send money for conservation that would be impossible in other circumstances,” she said. “This is an opportunity for Ecuador.”

As for whether Ecuador might one day participate in a swap with China, Chávez chose her words carefully.

“If it was an open door,” she said, “maybe we’d explore that.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2241478719-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-12-21 05:58:00.222164

Those are the individuals that you know should never have been pushed out of their out of their homes, some of these terrible stories that we would hear because they couldn't afford the taxes because they went up too high,"" Pol said.

Pol also speaking on the impact of the loss of funding for public safety, such as police officers and firefighters, with Michigan City saying it will not negotiate with the departments until the impact of the bill is known.

""The idea that we put our communities in such a strain that they, you know, they are looking at their budgets going we can't meet the needs of these, these agencies. It's, it's exactly what we want. And you know, the last thing we want to see is either a cut of services or that our firefighters or police officers and EMTs aren't being paid, but they should be,"" Pol said.

Outside of Senate Enrolled Act One, the impact of data centers in the state was a major topic of discussion, with the community feeling like they have a lack of answers.

""They're going to be their permanent neighbors, and they don't know what the effects of those are. They don't know how much their utility bills are going to go up. They don't, you know, some people have environmental concerns, health concerns, things that probably the data centers could do a very, a lot better of a job explaining,"" Pol said.",https://wsbt.com/resources/media2/16x9/1920/1320/center/90/434998db-bfe7-407b-9e15-a9d21bb79392-MichiganCitySE1townhallAB.0019_frame_0.jpeg,N,,2025-12-21 03:57:44.982349

Is Plug Power a buy?

Plug Power is taking steps through Project Quantum Leap to enhance its business efficiency and improve its bottom line. The company aims to strengthen its balance sheet and reduce costs this year. Management is hopeful of ending the year with a breakeven gross margin and expects to achieve positive earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) by the second half of next year.

Management says the quality of project engagements is much higher than previously seen and that projects have a much higher probability of reaching a final investment decision compared to a few years ago, when fewer project opportunities advanced.

That said, Plug Power has its work cut out for it. Through the third quarter, the company still has a net loss of $789 million on $485 million in revenue. Investors should monitor Plug's initiatives going forward to see whether cost-cutting and a narrower focus on growth improve profitability. Until then, I believe investors are best advised to avoid the stock.

The progress was welcomed because far too often and for far too long Illinois state and city leaders have abused businesses to bail themselves out of fiscal mismanagement and spending increases. We’ll take the wins, but let’s keep going in the New Year.

The health of business is key to Illinois’ economic well-being, and our key sector also is our most vulnerable to politicians: small businesses. Nearly 99% of net new jobs created in Illinois since the pandemic came from businesses with fewer than 20 employees, amounting to about 172,000 jobs since 2020.

These businesses also are delivering faster wage growth. Since 2020, wages at businesses with fewer than 50 employees grew more than 30%, outpacing both mid-sized firms and large corporations.

For policymakers the lesson is clear: When businesses succeed, Illinois’ economy succeeds. The continued vitality of these employers means more jobs, better wages and abundant opportunity across the state — particularly in Cook County, where small firms have been the only net job creators since the pandemic.

Here’s what Illinois got right regarding business in 2025.

Rejecting tax hikes

One of the most immediate wins came from Chicago and other cities missing the Oct. 1 deadline to reinstate a local grocery tax. As a result, Chicagoans will avoid paying the tax through at least the first half of 2026, saving families an estimated $40 million over six months. Other large cities also will let grocery taxes end Dec. 31, including Springfield.

Illinoisans, as well as grocery stores, neighborhood markets and restaurants, have been struggling with inflation and rising food costs. Removing this tax alleviates some of the burden on residents and the local businesses that depend on steady foot traffic to operate.

Next, leaders rejected a first-in-the-world tax on unrealized capital gains and a statewide delivery tax that would’ve charged a flat fee on every purchase to fill a Chicago-area public transportation deficit. These would have been disastrous for Illinois residents and businesses.

Unfortunately, lawmakers did pass an increase to the Cook County and collar counties’ sales taxes. They decided most of the Regional Transportation Authority budget gap will be filled by shifting already-collected revenue from the transportation fund rather than from additional, new tax hikes.

Last, most Chicago aldermen have adopted a more business-friendly mindset during Chicago’s budget battle, with a large contingency rejecting Mayor Brandon Johnson’s plan to reinstate a “head tax” on employers. These aldermen cited the tax’s anti-growth, anti-business effects as reasons to find alternative plans that don’t punish the city's largest job suppliers.

Easing government regulations

Illinois progressed when state lawmakers ended a 40-year ban on building large-scale nuclear energy facilities. Lifting the nuclear moratorium should strengthen Illinois’ energy reliability, lower long-term costs and position the state to compete for advanced manufacturing, data centers and artificial intelligence investments. The moratorium reversal sent the message that Illinois is open to innovation, private capital and long-term economic growth.

Tech companies already have signaled strong interest in Illinois’ nuclear capacity, with firms such as Meta, Google and Microsoft pursuing long-term nuclear energy contracts. Meta’s deal supporting the Clinton Clean Energy Center preserved more than 1,100 high-paying jobs while replacing taxpayer subsidies with private investment — a model that benefits workers, businesses and taxpayers alike.

Chicago city leaders also embraced modern attitudes toward work by eliminating college degree requirements for most city jobs. By shifting toward skills-based hiring, the city opened the door to a broader workforce, which should reduce hiring bottlenecks and create new pathways to stable employment.

Illinois still faces serious fiscal challenges, but this year proved progress is possible when lawmakers work to eliminate barriers for businesses that will strengthen the economy.

The path forward is clear: continue prioritizing economic competitiveness and policies that let businesses grow. When Illinois chooses reforms that respect job creators and taxpayers, everyone benefits — and these bright spots show better choices are within reach.

Rowan County is one of 60 counties DEQ is adding to the program on Dec. 15, for a total of 98 counties. The final two counties will be added in January.

“The cost of living is too high across the board, so it’s particularly exciting to see Energy Saver NC’s initiative expand statewide,” said Governor Josh Stein in a press release. “This program will help more North Carolina families make ends meet and keep their energy costs affordable. I am pleased that Energy Saver NC is making homes healthier and more efficient and supporting local jobs across North Carolina.”

DEQ Secretary Reid Wilson added, “Energy Saver NC will help Rowan Co. families who need it most save money on utility bills, make their homes healthier and more comfortable, reduce pollution emissions, and improve our air quality. This vital program will improve North Carolinians’ lives on a daily basis, from efficient new electric appliances to installation of new heating and cooling systems.”

The program was launched in January 2025 with $208 million from the U.S. Department of Energy.

How it works

Energy Saver NC includes two pathways designed to help families make their homes more energy-efficient and drive down their utility bills:

Homeowners Managing Efficiency Savings (HOMES) — Offers eligible households up to $16,000 for home efficiency upgrades, such as air sealing or energy-efficient HVAC units.

Home Electrification and Appliance Rebates (HEAR) — Provides up to $14,000 for high-efficiency electrical appliances such as heat pump water heaters and electric stoves.

Why it matters

By helping eligible families improve their homes with energy-efficient upgrades, the program:

Reduces monthly power bills.

Makes homes resilient and improves home comfort and safety, especially during extreme weather.

Strengthens the reliability of NC’s power grid by reducing energy demand and strain on the grid.

Supports local jobs that keep investing in the community.

Launched to meet growing energy demands and rising costs, Energy Saver NC directly supports North Carolina’s focus on ensuring that energy supplies are affordable, reliable and clean.

Who is eligible?

Rebates are based on household income and projected energy savings. Rebates include:

Full rebates — Up to 100 percent of project costs covered by the rebate up to a certain amount. Available for single-family homeowners earning less than 80 percent of their Area Median Income (AMI) as determined by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development.

Partial rebates — Up to 50 percent of project costs covered by the rebate up to a certain amount. Available for moderate-income homeowners earning between 80 percent and 150 percent of the AMI.

The rebate amount is paid to the contractor after the project is complete. Residents are only responsible for any remaining costs after rebate amounts are applied.

For example, a four-person household in Rowan County earning up to $70,150 may qualify for a full rebate. Both single-family homeowners and renters, with landlord approval, are eligible to apply.

Once income eligibility is confirmed, households applying for the HOMES program will receive a free home energy assessment. During the visit, a certified assessor will evaluate a home’s energy use and recommends improvements that will save families the most money.

All upgrades must be completed by an Energy Saver NC-approved contractor. Contractors are registered, licensed professionals specially trained in energy-efficiency installations. These partnerships not only ensure quality work but also create new business opportunities, local jobs, and economic growth within Rowan County.

After reviewing contractor quotes, households approve the projects and pricing with the rebate applied. Once the Energy Saver NC program team gives final approval, contractors complete the work, helping families start saving on their energy bills right away.",https://www.salisburypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/07/Salisbury-Post.png,N,,2025-12-21 07:58:42.559453

By Eric Starkman

My cousin Rob makes for a compelling case study as to why China has eaten Detroit’s lunch on electric vehicles — and who is ultimately responsible for the decline of America’s once globally respected automotive industry.

At the urging of a friend, Cousin Rob test-drove a Tesla Model Y in 2020 and bought one on the spot. Cousin Rob loves technology. He’s an early adopter who gravitates toward products he considers genuinely cutting edge. He put the Model Y squarely in that category.

A few years later, Rob upgraded to a Model S, and he couldn’t be happier. He regularly raves about Tesla’s software updates, incremental improvements, and services that legacy automakers still don’t seem to grasp, much less deliver. These are features the auto media either underplays, ignores, or, more alarmingly, seems not to understand at all.

What’s notable is that Cousin Rob didn’t suddenly declare himself an environmentalist or buy a Tesla to save the planet. He bought it because he viewed the car as technologically superior to internal combustion vehicles and among the safest on the road. His decision was based on technology, not politics.

That distinction matters.

Cardinal Rule

GM and Ford violated a cardinal rule that major U.S. corporations long understood: never get in bed with politicians or allow your products to become political statements. Joe Biden chose to make electric vehicles a political issue, repeatedly warning that climate change had reached “code red” and that the nation and the world were in peril. His administration never treated EVs as a consumer option, but as a mandate Americans were expected to accept without question.

GM’s Mary Barra and Ford’s Jim Farley eagerly climbed aboard that train. Both CEOs positioned themselves as leaders of environmentally virtuous companies, even as GM and Ford continued generating nearly all their profits from gas-powered trucks and SUVs. Barra went so far as to proclaim that GM would be selling more EVs than Tesla by 2025 and that by 2035 the company would manufacture only electric vehicles. There was no visible market research to justify such declarations.

What followed was a familiar pattern. GM and Ford expected U.S. taxpayers to subsidize their transitions while increasingly moving engineering and manufacturing operations offshore. Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act showered EVs with incentives, many of which applied to vehicles most Americans could not afford, including models assembled in Mexico.

The federal and state governments also subsidized the construction and retooling of EV plants, while GM and Ford also counted on Washington to build a national charging infrastructure to support their products. When that failed to materialize, GM and Ford piggybacked on Tesla’s proprietary charging network, seemingly untroubled that their customers were now relying on a competitor to support their EVs.

Massive Marketing Budget Cut

Normally, when companies introduce genuinely new technologies, they increase marketing spending to explain and promote them. Yet in 2022, despite committing GM to a radical break from a century of internal combustion engineering, Barra cut the company’s marketing budget by $1 billion.

Norm de Greve, whom Barra recruited from CVS to serve as GM’s chief marketing officer, later told The Drum that he learned about the cut a week before joining the company while listening to an investor call. That suggests either that de Greve failed to confirm Barra’s commitment to marketing before accepting the job or that Barra pulled the rug out from under him after the fact.

Either way, de Greve’s October interview with The Drum is revealing. He speaks at length about GM rediscovering the “soul” of its brand and touts the company’s proprietary AI platform, Metropolis, which he credits with helping increase market share. Notably absent from the discussion is any meaningful reference to EV adoption, despite electric vehicles supposedly representing GM’s future.

For all of GM’s ballyhooed proprietary AI, it apparently lacked the intelligence to warn management that the company’s EV strategy was failing and headed for a $1.6 billion write-down — the same year Barra vowed she would be selling more Teslas than Elon Musk.

Musk’s Squandered Marketing Advantages

Musk, for his part, squandered advantages that could have buried GM and Ford and positioned their gas-engine fleets as the automotive equivalent of dial-up internet access. He is a brilliant technologist, but he does not value marketing and never properly branded Tesla as a cutting-edge Silicon Valley pioneer and distinguishing it from GM and Ford, whose profits are overwhelmingly driven by century old technology.

Steve Jobs understood the value of marketing. In 2009, when apps were still in their infancy and most Americans were unfamiliar with their capabilities, Apple ran compelling commercials explaining what apps did and how they could be downloaded to the iPhone, which had been introduced only two years earlier. Apps would have caught on eventually, but Apple’s 2008 App Store launch gave the company a decisive competitive edge.

Not only was Musk remiss in failing to brand Tesla as a pioneering technology company, he also tarnished the company’s brand by promoting his conservative politics and getting into bed with Donald Trump, alienating much of his core customer base.

Even today, Tesla does a poor job marketing its superior technological capabilities.

Thanksgiving Night Rescue

On Thanksgiving night, Cousin Rob was driving on a highway through the San Gabriel Valley, about 22 miles east of downtown Los Angeles, when he incurred a flat tire. Fortunately, just weeks earlier he had signed up for Tesla’s $25-per-month wheel and tire protection service, which covers tire replacement at no additional cost.

Despite it being a holiday weekend, Rob used his Tesla app to contact the company, and within 20 minutes a flatbed arrived to take him and his vehicle to the nearest Tesla service center. At approximately 9 a.m. the following morning, he received a notification that his tire had been replaced, and the car was ready for pickup.

In another example of Tesla’s more advanced technological capabilities, GM has confirmed plans to introduce iPhone digital key functionality using Apple Wallet, notably without offering a timeline. Cousin Rob has been using his iPhone as his Tesla key since he bought his first Tesla nearly six years ago. Tesla also mastered Apple watch connectivity months before GM, which stumbled on the integration.

That GM is now using Apple Wallet for key access is yet another example of how far one of America’s premier marketing companies has fallen. GM has made the unpopular decision to drop Apple CarPlay from its vehicles, yet it actively promotes Apple Wallet and has announced plans to add Apple Music to its in-car infotainment system. GM cannot seem to decide whether it wants its vehicles to support Apple products or not.

China’s EV Superiority

The contrast becomes even clearer when looking at China. What most Americans do not appreciate is why and how China achieved its EV superiority.

In the 1990s, China’s government concluded that it could never develop domestic brands capable of competing head-to-head with Volkswagen, BMW, or even General Motors, all of which had established strong market positions inside the country.

Beijing identified an opening where incumbents were vulnerable: electric vehicles. This strategy had little to do with climate change. China continues to expand coal-fired power generation to support its grid.

Instead, EVs were viewed as a way to leapfrog legacy automakers technologically and assert global industrial dominance. The government focused on execution, scale, and technical competence, drawing on experienced automotive leadership to drive its EV ambitions.

By contrast, decades later, after China had already established a commanding position in EVs, the U.S. approach framed electric vehicles primarily as a political and regulatory project rather than a consumer technology opportunity. The emphasis shifted toward symbolism and mandates, not product superiority or market appeal.

A Country of Cousin Robs

Chinese consumers are a massive collection of Cousin Robs and embraced EVs not because of climate messaging but because the vehicles were positioned as rolling technology platforms and tech-luxury lifestyle statements — aspirational, software-driven, and status-enhancing.

In China today, Tesla is no longer the uncontested leader in EV innovation. Domestic competitors have closed the gap and, in some cases, surpassed Tesla by treating electric vehicles as consumer technology products.

The U.S. media delights in pointing out that China currently has a glut of EVs, the result of its government spawning too many upstarts, which Barra herself says now number more than 100 competitors. That’s true. But China plays a long game, unlike Barra, who manages GM to meet the quarterly demands of Wall Street.

The undeniable truth is that the Biden administration chose to bet America’s EV future on GM and Ford, and Barra and Farley have unequivocally demonstrated they were not up to the challenge.

The Wisdom of Wall Street?

Still, both executives have their diehard defenders, particularly Barra, whose loyalists argue she is doing an outstanding job, pointing to GM’s fourth-quarter rally and a stock price trading near its 52-week high.

What those defenders rarely mention is what fueled that rally. Barra reassured Wall Street that GM was once again focused on selling high-margin gas-powered trucks and SUVs, while continuing to describe EVs as the company’s “North Star.”

“We believe Barra & Co. are prepared for all options on the table as it balances its ICE and EV strategies,” Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives wrote in a research note.

This is the same Ives who more than four years ago declared that “the vertical integration capabilities of GM and conversion of its massive customer base to electric vehicles over the coming years represents a transformational opportunity” and issued a “buy” rating on GM’s stock that still trades below his projected target from four years ago.

For those who regard a company’s stock price as investor wisdom one can take to the bank, it is worth recalling that GM’s shares traded between roughly $30 and $40 in mid-2007, remained in the mid-20s through much of 2008, and a year later the company was bankrupt.

Investors did not anticipate that collapse until it was unavoidable, after GM had already depleted cash through buybacks and financial engineering — many of the same tools that have helped propel GM’s stock to its current level.",https://d2nyfqh3g1stw3.cloudfront.net/photos/featured_farley_and_barra_55685.jpg,N,,2025-12-20 23:58:24.697637

John Block and New Mexico GOP Chair Amy Barela—the landscape tells a different story from their rhetoric when it comes to renewable energy. Massive solar arrays like the 120 MW Buena Vista Energy Center and community projects like Pluma Solar Alamogordo and Carrizozo Solar stand as testaments to market-driven progress, generating hundreds of construction jobs, ongoing maintenance roles, and millions in local revenue for roads, schools, and services.

Tesla’s new Supercharger which just opened at Lowe’s Signature Market in Alamogordo further weaves EV infrastructure into the fabric, supporting skilled tech work for hardware, software upgrades, and upkeep—jobs that draw on high-demand skills in a county hungry for economic opportunities.

This quiet revolution unfolds amid political resistance: Otero County, with its vast sunny deserts and state trust lands, has become a hub for solar development despite its conservative leanings. Key projects include:

• Buena Vista Energy Center (also called Buena Vista Solar): The largest solar facility in New Mexico, located near Chaparral. Developed by NextEra Energy Resources and operational since 2023, it generates 120 MW of solar power plus 50 MW battery storage—enough to power ~60,000 homes. It spans ~2,700 acres, created ~150 construction jobs, and provides ~$12 million in tax revenue over 30 years for local roads, schools, and services. Operated under a long-term agreement with El Paso Electric, it doubles the utility’s solar capacity.

• Pluma Solar Alamogordo: A 5 MW community solar project on state lands, approved in 2025. It powers 1,250–1,500 homes and generates at least $2 million for Eastern New Mexico University. Located near Holloman Air Force Base, it exemplifies affordable clean energy access for locals unable to install rooftop solar.

• Carrizozo Solar Project: A 3 MW community-scale array owned by Otero County Electric Cooperative (OCEC). It delivers power at under 4.5 cents/kWh—one of the lowest U.S. rates for distributed solar—and saves members ~$250,000 annually in energy costs.

• Alamogordo Substation Solar Garden: A smaller 76 kW project by OCEC, operational since 2014, using micro-inverters for efficient renewable generation.

• Alamogordo Solar and Storage Project (125 MW solar + 50 MW storage): Acquired by Greenvolt Power in 2023 from Solariant Capital, expected to produce 300+ GWh annually and power ~20,000 homes.

These projects highlight Otero County’s role in New Mexico’s renewable boom, driven by state land auctions and private investment.

Tesla’s Role and the Alamogordo Supercharger

Tesla owns and operates its Supercharger network, including the Alamogordo station at Lowe’s Signature Market (675 E 10th St). Opened this week. This station features multiple stalls for fast charging—up to 250 kW—ideal for travelers along US-54/US-70 near White Sands National Park and Holloman AFB. Tesla partners with hosts like Lowe’s for site access, attracting EV drivers and boosting local foot traffic during the 30 minute charge to the Alamogordo MainStreet New York Avenue District and to downtown businesses.

Maintenance involves skilled Tesla technicians for hardware, software updates, and upgrades, creating jobs in Otero county with limited high-tech opportunities.

No other Tesla owned and managed Superchargers exist in Otero County; the network focuses on major routes, with nearby ones in Las Cruces and planned expansions like Roswell. Alamogordo led Roswell in this implementation.

Deeper Dive into Hypocrisy of Block and Barela

State Rep. John Block (R-District 51, Alamogordo) has called renewables “enviro-Marxist,” criticized the 2019 Energy Transition Act for harming fossil fuels, and introduced failed House Bill 45 in 2025 to impose a 3.75% excise tax on renewable production—potentially stifling growth. He advocates expanding oil, gas, and coal for jobs and revenue.

Amy Barela, Otero County Commissioner and NM GOP Chair (elected 2024), echoes this by prioritizing oil/gas to lower costs and strengthen the economy, opposing policies that shift from fossils.

Yet in their backyard, renewables flourish: Buena Vista alone created 150 construction jobs and millions in revenue, while community projects like Pluma and Carrizozo deliver affordable power and savings. The Tesla Supercharger enables EV adoption, aligning with clean energy trends. Critics call this hypocrisy—leaders decry renewables while local developments bring economic benefits, jobs, and infrastructure to a red county. Supporters argue it’s pragmatic: fossils remain key, but renewables add diversification without replacement.

Tying It All Together

In the heart of deep-red Otero County—home to Rep. John Block and GOP Chair Amy Barela—the landscape tells a different story from their rhetoric. Massive solar arrays like Buena Vista and community projects like Pluma and Carrizozo stand as testaments to market-driven progress, generating hundreds of construction jobs, ongoing maintenance roles, and millions in local revenue. Tesla’s Supercharger at Lowe’s further weaves EV infrastructure into the fabric, supporting skilled tech work and drawing travelers to Alamogordo.

This quiet revolution unfolds amid political resistance: Block’s failed tax proposals like most of his failures, and Barela’s fossil fuel focus contrast sharply with the tangible gains—higher wages from renewables, energy savings for residents, and economic boosts in a county that needs them.

What is revealed is a core irony: even in conservative strongholds with resistance by out of touch politicians like John Block, who has never worked a day in building a sustainable business model nor ever created a job, clean energy thrives! What business interests, in spite of out of touch politicians, is proving, is that renewable energy is not an ideological foe but a practical ally for jobs, resilience, and community strength.

As New Mexico pushes toward renewables, Otero County’s on-the-ground reality, driven by business interests versus political rhetoric—solar panels gleaming under the desert sun, EVs charging in parking lots near Alamogordo MainStreet —may ultimately bridge divides, showing that embracing solar and EV infrastructure strengthens communities for the long haul.

This legislative effort, supported by TIPRO, will streamline federal permitting processes under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969.

The following statement can be attributed to Ed Longanecker, President of TIPRO:

“On behalf of our nearly 3,000 members, TIPRO applauds the passage of H.R. 4776 in the U.S. House of Representatives. Comprehensive permitting reform is a strategic imperative for our country and industry. Without it, America’s energy sector, particularly oil and natural gas, cannot operate at the pace or scale needed to meet domestic needs, support allies abroad, or ensure long-term affordability for consumers. For too long, federal infrastructure approvals have languished in bureaucratic limbo, with critical energy projects delayed by years due to duplicative reviews, inconsistent agency coordination, and open-ended legal challenges.

Permitting paralysis has real-world consequences. American families feel it at the gas pump. Manufacturers see it in elevated energy costs. And communities waiting for the economic benefits of infrastructure development, including jobs, tax revenue, and improved local services, watch opportunity pass them by. In addition, the coming AI revolution, with the need to power massive data centers across the country, will drive further demand for American natural gas. When domestic production is throttled, imports from less regulated producers fill the gap, increasing global emissions and undermining U.S. environmental standards.

For the oil and natural gas industry, comprehensive permitting reform is mission critical. It unlocks investment, accelerates innovation, strengthens national security, and ensures that the United States remains a reliable energy partner to the world. At a time when energy reliability and affordability are top concerns for working Americans, we strongly encourage expedited consideration in the U.S. Senate to help reshape the federal permitting process for energy infrastructure.”

The SPEED Act: Reforming Federal Permitting to Accelerate Economic Development

The Standardizing Permitting and Expediting Economic Development (SPEED) Act, formally designated as H.R. 4776, represents a bipartisan legislative effort to streamline federal permitting processes under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969. Introduced on July 25, 2025, by Rep. Bruce Westerman (R-AR), the chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee, and cosponsored by Rep. Jared Golden (D-ME), the bill aims to reduce bureaucratic delays that have long hindered infrastructure, energy, and economic projects across the United States. By addressing inefficiencies in environmental reviews, the SPEED Act seeks to foster economic growth, enhance energy security, and support critical developments such as transmission lines, data centers, and manufacturing operations, while maintaining core environmental safeguards.

Key Provisions of the SPEED Act

The SPEED Act modifies NEPA to expedite approvals without eliminating environmental oversight. Notable provisions include:

Standardizing Review Processes: The bill redefines “major federal actions” to exclude designations based solely on federal funding and exempts actions already reviewed under equivalent federal, state, or tribal environmental laws.

Setting Deadlines: It imposes strict timelines for environmental assessments and impact statements, typically limiting reviews to one to two years, to prevent indefinite delays.

Limiting Judicial Review: Lawsuits challenging NEPA compliance must be filed within 150 days of final agency action, and courts are directed to remand cases for correction rather than halting projects entirely. This provision also restricts standing to parties who submitted comments during the public review process, curbing frivolous or politically motivated litigation.

Enhancing Agency Coordination: The legislation requires better interagency collaboration and focuses reviews on “proximate” effects directly caused by the project, excluding speculative or unrelated impacts.

These reforms are designed to balance environmental protection with economic imperatives, particularly in sectors like mining, energy production, and AI infrastructure, where permitting delays have historically increased costs and deterred investment. Supporters argue that the bill will unlock domestic resources, reduce reliance on foreign supply chains, and create jobs.

The SPEED Act is particularly vital for the oil and natural gas industry, where protracted NEPA permitting processes have significantly impeded exploration, infrastructure development, and overall energy security. Over the past five decades, NEPA has evolved into a complex framework burdened by court rulings, executive directives, and agency interpretations, resulting in unpredictable delays that deter investment, stifle innovation, and increase project costs. For oil and gas exploration, these delays have stalled federal leasing and project approvals, limiting access to domestic resources and exacerbating reliance on foreign imports, which undermines national energy independence.

In terms of infrastructure, the bill addresses barriers to constructing essential facilities such as pipelines, liquefied natural gas (LNG) export terminals, and drilling operations. Permitting bottlenecks have historically prevented timely market access for crude oil and natural gas, leading to higher flaring rates and inefficient resource utilization. By imposing reasonable timelines, reducing frivolous litigation, and streamlining interagency reviews, the SPEED Act enables faster development of these projects, ensuring they are delivered on budget and supporting more efficient production methods. This is crucial for meeting growing domestic and global energy demands, particularly amid rising needs from sectors like artificial intelligence and manufacturing.

On energy security, the legislation promotes the expansion of reliable, affordable American energy supplies, generating jobs and tax revenues while potentially reducing global emissions by displacing higher-emission foreign alternatives. Overall, by cutting red tape while preserving environmental protections, the SPEED Act positions the oil and natural gas sector to contribute more effectively to national security, economic growth, and a stable energy grid.

Senate action in 2025 remains uncertain and unlikely, however reform could gain traction in 2026 as part of larger legislative packages, such as energy security or infrastructure bills, amid partisan debates on environmental policy. Advocates are pushing for Senate consideration, emphasizing the bill’s role in national security and economic competitiveness. If enacted, the SPEED Act could significantly reshape federal permitting, potentially accelerating projects critical to AI development and domestic manufacturing in the coming years.

There’s a word for this kind of reactionary response: greenlash, a social and political backlash against efforts to rein in emissions.

That opposition was mainly driven by specific economic burdens—Germany’s plan to switch to energy-efficient heat pumps caused an uproar as homeowners worried about the costs, for example.

A. Causes

A central impetus behind the recent EPA rollbacks was an administrative shift towards market-oriented regulations. In January 2025, President Trump signed an Executive Order titled “Unleashing American Energy,” aiming to promote energy production, primarily fossil fuels. The administration particularly emphasized efforts to “reduce trillions in regulatory cost,” (EPA.gov 2025) portraying environmental regulations as hidden taxes on families and businesses.

Two months later, the EPA announced “plans to roll back 31 key environmental rules on everything from clean air to clean water and climate change,” including a reconsideration of the 2009 Endangerment Finding, a scientific and legal basis for regulating greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act.

Another specific focus was fuel economy standards. The Trump administration sought to revise the Obama-era regulations under the SAFE Vehicles Rule. Consistent with the rationale of the Executive Order, Trump contended that stricter fuel efficiency standards raised vehicle prices and limited consumer choice.

Industry stakeholders and federal oversight were two important factors in these decisions. Groups representing fossil fuel, automotive, and heavy industry sectors claimed that environmental regulations increased compliance costs and harmed their competitiveness. Furthermore, the administration diminished the EPA’s enforcement capabilities through budget cuts and staff reductions, reflecting a broader intention to reduce the agency’s role in industry oversight.

B. Current Stances

Public and political responses to these regulatory rollbacks are mixed. Opponents, notably public health groups and environmental organizations, assert that weakening environmental regulations could result in increased health risks and a dramatic increase in air quality, emissions, and pollution, which is especially critical to communities already facing climate-related challenges.

Supporters counter that these changes lessen unnecessary regulatory burdens, reduce energy and manufacturing costs, and enhance U.S. competitiveness. The rollback of certain monitoring requirements for oil and gas producers was presented as a means to lower costs for small operators, and the revision of power plant rules was characterized as a way to balance environmental protection with economic flexibility. Many also argue that deregulation can foster innovation by giving industries more freedom to explore new technologies without strict compliance constraints.

These contrasting perspectives reflect a broader divide in US environmental policy between prioritizing public health and industry demands.

C. Relevance

The consequences of weakening environmental regulations during the Trump administration are directly linked to real-world climate disasters, such as the Southern California wildfires in January 2025. Scientists contend that the hot, dry, and windy conditions that fueled those fires were made approximately 35% more likely due to human-induced climate change (Yale Climate Connections 2025). Policies that reduce emissions standards or resists greenhouse gas regulations could increase the frequency or severity of these devastating climate disasters.

At the international level, the stakes are even higher. At the recent COP 30 meeting hosted in November, governments engaged in important policy discussions on climate change agreements and limits on fossil fuel use. The Trump administration’s absence in this conference has been criticized as an undermining of U.S. leadership at a time when global cooperation is essential to transition away from fossil fuels.

II. Impact on Communities

A. Stakeholders

A wide range of stakeholders are involved in these EPA changes. The EPA itself is a stakeholder, with internal divisions arising regarding the direction of the agency. In July 2025, the EPA put 139 employees on leave for signing a “declaration of dissent” voicing concerns over changes in the EPA’s research and development priorities and the termination of environmental justice initiatives that benefitted vulnerable communities (Cunningham, 2025).

Oil and gas companies are another prominent stakeholder. In March 2025, EPA announced plans to reconsider wastewater regulations for oil and gas industries to “unleash American energy” (US EPA, 2025a). Supporters argue that these changes reduce regulatory burdens and stimulate industries, while critics contend they debilitate accountability for environmentally harmful practices.

Vulnerable communities will also experience significant negative impact from these policies. For instance, the EPA’s plans to “terminat[e] Biden’s Environmental Justice and DEI arms of the agency (EJ/DEI)” will harm communities already experiencing the effects of climate change and environmental issues disproportionately (US EPA, 2025a; US EPA, 2025b).

Environmental organizations such as the NRDC and Center for Biodiversity are also crucial stakeholders attempting to mitigate the environment impact of these changes. The 2009 Endangerment Finding, which revealed that climate change was a risk to human welfare and health, is set to be reconsidered by the EPA (US EPA, 2025a). This carries the risk of undoing environmental organizations’ attempts to alleviate the effects of climate change and educate the public on the issue.

Finally, the general public is critically affected by these decisions. The EPA currently maintains that “it will be more affordable [for Americans] to purchase a car, heat homes, and operate a business… to bring manufacturing into local communities while individuals widely benefit from the tangible economic impacts” (US EPA, 2025a). Whether these economic benefits will outweigh environmental and public health costs remains contested.

B. Youth Impact

Young people in the United States are particularly affected by these regulatory changes as they will see their long-term consequences of environmental change and pollution. In fact, a 2016 report by the Center for Effective Government found that “nearly one in 10 children in the country attends one of the 12,000 schools located within 1 mile of a chemical facility” (Jones, 2025). Furthermore, as children are particularly more vulnerable to pollutants, concerns for youth health are also prevalent (Jones, 2025). In responses to these risks, advocacy groups and policymakers may increasingly pursue regulatory policies and attempts to further research and public outreach about environmental pollution and climate change.

III. Policy Problem

Current efforts and policy changes under the Trump Administration include key environment targets such as clean energy, water protection, and clean air.

A. Clean Energy

In June 2019, the EPA issued the final Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) rule replacing the Obama administration’s Clean Power Plan (CPP). Its main purpose was to regulate carbon dioxide emissions from power plants by establishing emission guidelines for individual states. Instead of encouraging a broader nationwide reduction of carbon dioxide emissions, the ACE focuses on emission reductions and efficiency improvements for individual power plants. Major regulations on reducing emissions are limited to reducing emissions from major power plants rather than encouraging an industry-wide transition to natural gas or renewable energy.

Therefore, although the Clean Energy Act reduces the emissions of major power plants, it is expected to increase the number of operating coal plants and amount of coal-fire electricity generation. It is estimated that by 2030, there will be an increase in the number of operating coal plants, with 28% of model plants showing higher CO2 emissions. In general, enforcements and regulations of the Clean Energy Act were less strict than the Clean Power Plan of the previous administration.

B. Water Protection

In 2020, the Trump administration rewrote the Water of the United States (WOTUS) to the Navigable Waters Protection Rule (NWPR) under the Clean Water Act. This new regulation significantly narrowed the scope of water bodies protected by federal law. The final revised definition of the Water of the United States was published on January 2023 and took effect the following March. The new revised act continues the protection of major water bodies, such as oceans, navigable waters, lakes used in commerce and many upstream waters. However, it removes and limits protection for other smaller and more isolated water bodies, neglecting the protection of all water bodies. Examples of excluded water bodies include ephemeral streams from rainfall, ditches, lakes and ponds that did not drain into regulated waters, and wetlands that did not touch regulated waters. This massively reduces the overall scope of the Clean Water Act. There have also been failed attempts to weaken PM2.5 standards from 12 to 9 along with attempts to dismiss the Particulate Matter Review Panel, a group of scientists specializing in researching PM2.5 health effects.

C. Clean Air

In January 2025, California withdrew requests for Clean Air Act waivers from the EPA that were needed to support vehicle emissions regulations. In 2019, the Trump administration revoked California’s waiver for greenhouse gas emissions, acting as a hindrance to California’s goal to transition to zero-emission vehicles.

IV. Policy Options

A. Restore BIPOC Inclusion in Environmental Law and Decision-Making

During the Trump administration, the EPA significantly weakened its commitment to environmental justice, removing references to equity, reducing community consultation, and disbanding advisory bodies that included BIPOC voices. These actions left marginalized communities even more vulnerable to pollution and environmental harm.

To directly address this damage, Congress should pass legislation mandating that all EPA rulemakings undergo a Racial and Environmental Equity Impact Review, with measurable criteria for assessing disproportionate harm. The EPA must also re-establish and expand its National Environmental Justice Advisory Council (NEJAC), ensuring that it includes BIPOC legal and scientific professionals from frontline communities. In addition, a new Environmental Justice Civil Legal Fund should be created to ensure that communities of colour can access legal representation during disputes over permitting, contamination, or infrastructure siting. These measures will ensure that those most affected by pollution are not excluded from shaping the laws intended to protect them.

B. Rebuild Community Environmental Education and Organizing Capacity

Under the Trump administration, federal funding for environmental education, particularly in underserved communities, was sharply reduced, and support for science-based public engagement was deprioritized. This created a knowledge gap and limited the ability of affected residents to identify hazards or respond effectively.

To rebuild public capacity, the EPA should partner with the Department of Education to launch a Community Environmental Education Initiative, directing funds toward schools and nonprofits in areas previously underserved by federal support. These programs must include education on environmental health risks, regulatory rights, and organizing strategies. Furthermore, the federal government should incentivize public colleges to develop Environmental Justice Certificate Programs for local organizers and high school graduates from impacted areas. Investing in BIPOC-led educational programming, especially around pollution tracking, legal action, and data collection, will empower communities to hold agencies and polluters accountable when regulatory systems fail.

C. Reintroduce Federal Monitoring and Accountability Mechanisms

One of the most damaging changes under the Trump administration was the suppression of scientific data, the rollback of emissions standards, and the loosening of regulatory enforcement for polluting industries. The EPA weakened protections under the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act, removed climate change references from official documents, and allowed more discretion for state-level leniency, despite rising environmental health disparities.

To reverse these effects, the EPA must reinstate the Clean Power Plan (CPP) or introduce a stronger federal emissions framework that sets mandatory state-by-state targets, prioritizes renewables, and limits reliance on natural gas as a “bridge fuel.” In addition, Congress must require the EPA to publish annual equity audits, detailing how each regulation has impacted air, water, and public health in BIPOC communities. A centralized Public Environmental Risk Portal should also be developed, making real-time pollution data, enforcement actions, and permit approvals transparent and accessible to the public.

Crucially, new legislation must include anti-backsliding provisions, which prevent future administrations from rolling back protections without rigorous scientific review and Congressional oversight. Regulatory enforcement should be tied to federal funding eligibility; agencies and contractors that fail environmental justice compliance checks should be denied grants or licenses.

Here comes Santa Claus

wearing his bulletproof vest.

He’s bringing lots of toys

and bags of fun,

but all they want

are more ammo and lots of guns.

Nine teens are shot

after the lighting of the annual Christmas tree.

As Governor Pritzker defiantly declares:

“We don’t need the National Guard here,”

violent criminals are getting away.

What a way to spend the holidays,

when bullets are flying your way.

So let’s hope here in Philly

we can show “The Brotherly Love” way,

to spend a safe and joyous Christmas Day.

Support Red Cross

When disaster strikes, it often happens in the middle of the night, catching families off guard and leaving them with nothing but uncertainty. In those moments, Red Cross volunteers – neighbors from our own community – are there to provide comfort, emergency lodging and recovery support. Thanks to donations of money and time, this kind of care happens every eight minutes across the U.S., most often after a home fire. And during the holidays, home fire responses spike nearly 20% nationwide due to seasonal risks. In Southeastern Pennsylvania alone, our volunteers have provided emergency assistance to more than 170 people after nearly 50 home fires – just since Thanksgiving. We’ll be there for them – because of our generous donors and volunteers who help in so many ways. But our mission goes beyond disaster relief; we help patients in need of lifesaving blood, teach critical skills like first aid and CPR and support veterans and military families navigating unique challenges. This holiday season, please consider donating at redcross.org. Your gift ensures that when the unexpected happens, families have the support and care they need – because no one should face a disaster alone.

Approve clean-energy projects

Pennsylvania families will see higher electricity bills this winter, with PECO customers facing a 6% increase. One major reason for these rising costs isn’t something most of us ever hear about: PJM, the group that runs our power grid. PJM is responsible for approving new energy projects across our region. Yet nearly all of the renewable projects proposed in recent years are stuck waiting in their “queue.” These renewable energy projects would supply enough electricity to power 60 million homes in the region. Instead of advancing these cost-saving solar, wind and storage projects, PJM has slowed approvals to a crawl, keeping us reliant on expensive, polluting fossil fuels. Pennsylvania is currently 49th in the nation when it comes to renewable energy growth. We need that to change. If PJM allowed the clean-energy projects already proposed to connect to the grid, we could lower utility bills, reduce harmful emissions and make Pennsylvania a leader in affordable, homegrown renewable power. PJM should clear its backlog and bring these overdue clean-energy projects online. Pennsylvania families deserve an energy system that keeps the lights on without polluting our air, driving up costs or locking us into outdated methods.

School district is the problem

The city has passed so many bills to help tenants and screw the landlords, I’m surprised there are any rentals on the market. It’s amazing how the powers-to-be deem this because the city has so many low-income residents. Maybe the city officials are looking at the situation a— backwards. They should start with the city’s beloved school system that is under-educating and producing low-income renters. This is the source of problem. When your education system has a graduation rate of about 68% and the present 4th-graders are way below the national averages in math and reading, of course you’re going to have low-income residents. The problem isn’t high rents and fees, it’s the city officials allowing the school district to graduate low-income residents. Solve the education problem and you will solve the low-income problem. Stop putting a Band-Aid on it.

Affordability is an interesting word, because it is so subjective.

What makes one thing affordable and something else unaffordable?

A new car becomes affordable when your car does not pass inspection (a thing of the past in New Hampshire in a month or two), but the same car would be unaffordable if your car is running well and not rusted from all salt dumped on New Hampshire roads.

That guitar you always dreamed about owning becomes affordable when your guitar’s neck is warped and the estimate for the neck reset will cost you almost as much as the new guitar.

But there are other things that are more objective such as the price of gas, which you can do little about except shop around for the cheapest price as long as you don’t have to travel too far.

The price of eggs or milk or meat or fish or other essential foods also are more objective when it comes to affordability.

Cell phones are a necessity today, but do you need a new one every year or two years because you are obsessed with the latest devices with all the new bells and whistles.

New cell phones are not “affordable” for most people if you have to pay for them up front, but the carriers have deals and monthly plans to pay them off over time.

Another necessity is electricity. Most people do not have the luxury of generating their own electricity or being off the grid, and have to pay what utilities charge with the blessing of state regulators and they don’t offer installment plans unless you are really poor.

And state regulators in New Hampshire gave the state’s largest electric utility Eversource a gift this year by replacing traditional rate making with automatic rate increases projected to reflect inflationary increases.

Such decisions by the Public Utilities Commission should be a reminder why New Hampshire has some of the highest rates for electricity in the country. New England in general has high electric rates, but New Hampshire’s are the highest.

A look at the daily price board at the regional system operator’s — Independent System Operator(ISO) New England — website and you will see New Hampshire usually has the highest daily spot market price in New England.

New Hampshire has long generated more electricity than it needs due to several large providers like Seabrook Station, the state’s only nuclear power plant, and Merrimack Station, New England’s last coal burning generating plant that is about to shut down. The last few years the plant has only run sporadically as it removed from the base suppliers and has “peaker status,” which means it is only used when the electric load is at its highest.

New Hampshire also has several natural-gas-fired plants, one sort of oil-fired plant and several wood burners as well as some hydro generating facilities along the state’s major rivers.

Outside of Seabrook’s power, fossil fuels are producing the bulk of the power the state produces.

Massachusetts is about to begin receiving 1,200 megawatts of Hydro Quebec power which was first going to traverse New Hampshire from the Canadian border to Deerfield for the Northern Pass transmission project, until regulators killed it.

So instead the Hydro Quebec power is coming through Maine to hook into the New England grid so Massachusetts can receive the benefit of cheaper, cleaner power it has sought for a decade or more.

Massachusetts and other New England states have sought to broaden the sources of their electricity to include renewable energy derived from wind, water and the sun, while New Hampshire has lagged far behind.

New Hampshire energy policy has longed clung to the belief that fossil fuel generated electricity is cheaper than that produced by renewable and alternative sources, but the equation is changing with solar power becoming competitive as is large wind generated power like those proposed offshore while the large hydro projects like those in Canada produce electricity cheaper than fossil fuels, whose costs are volatile on the world market.

Earlier this year, New Hampshire passed a new state energy policy following in the footsteps of the sitting president who unilaterally cancelled several offshore wind projects ready to go, including one off the New England coast.

In the 2025 session lawmakers approved House Bill 682, which sponsors said would focus the state’s energy needs on market driven, affordable and efficient sources, i.e. fossil fuel generation.

The bill also removed the Office of Wind Energy from the Department of Energy, repealed the offshore wind industry workforce training center committee and the offshore and port development commission, and moved the grid modernization advisory council and the hydrogen advisory council to the office of energy innovation.

The changes are designed to align with President Trump’s executive order to eliminate offshore wind and turbine development, according to bill supporters.

Opponents called the state’s new energy plan backward looking and said it would lock the state out of any wind power development in the Gulf of Maine.

New Hampshire lawmakers have also been slow to embrace net metering in any large scale way, which allows people with solar panels to sell the excess energy created to the public utility.

The bill that passed was model legislation developed by the American Legislative Exchange Council, a group established in 1973 by a number of conservative organizations and major companies associated with the fossil fuel, pharmaceutical, tobacco, insurance, chemical, alcohol and various other groups with a far-right libertarian agenda.

A fair number of Republican legislators in New Hampshire are members and often attend the group’s national convention and this summer a photo was sent around showing about 20 to 25 GOP House and Senate members there.

The conventions are free to the lawmakers who have their expenses paid while lobbyists and industry experts “teach” them how to craft bills that become model legislation that often shows up before the New Hampshire legislature on any number of issues from transgender medicine to voting rights.

But a fair number of the Republicans on the House Science, Technology and Energy Committee were pictured at the convention including chair Michael Vose, R-Epping.

The organization has long been linked to the Koch Foundation as one of its founders came from the Heritage Foundation which has been supported by the Kochs and ALEC is on the board of Project 2025 overseen by the Heritage Foundation.

The Koch brothers first made their fortune by under-representing the amount of oil they pumped from reservations owed by indigenous people as the film Killer of the Flower Moon portrayed.

A number of GOP lawmakers in New Hampshire also belong to the Young Americans for Liberty offshoot for state lawmakers that host similar “seminars” to influence lawmakers in various ways and likewise provides free trips to these events.

American for Prosperity, a Koch affiliated group, dumped about $1 million in each of the last three general elections into New Hampshire House and Senate races, very successfully.

That has been a very good investment for the fossil fuel industry, but maybe not so good for those who have to pay the high price of electricity in New Hampshire because it is so dependent on fossil fuel to generate it.

How far down does this influence reach?

A bill coming before the House in the first week of the 2026 session, House Bill 610, would limit the purview of the state’s Consumer Advocate for Residential Customers, “to focus exclusively on assuring that residential utility customers receive safe and reliable service at the lowest possible cost while maximizing customer freedom and autonomy.”

The original bill would have eliminated the position, but this one prevents the consumer advocate from advocating for renewable energy projects or energy efficiency programs that also might save residential and all customers a little money because in the New Hampshire legislature oil money speaks louder than the voices of ratepayers.

These tenders are part of the FerX Transitional framework, a mechanism approved by the Italian Ministry of Environment and Energy Security (MASE) to support the development and construction of new renewable energy generation capacity.

The awarded projects originate from the LIMES portfolio, acquired by the Group in February 2025, and further strengthen ContourGlobal’s development pipeline in Italy.

FerX and NZIA tenders

Under the tenders awarded by the Italian Energy Services Operator (GSE), ContourGlobal secured 69MWdc under the support schemes, in addition to developing projects with a total installed capacity of approximately 80MWdc. The additional capacity will operate on a merchant basis, outside the tender framework.

The project awarded under the FerX tender involves the construction of a 37MWdc solar PV plant in the province of Trapani, Sicily. Construction is expected to begin next year, with commercial operation planned for 2027.

In addition, ContourGlobal secured two projects under the NZIA (Net Zero Industry Act) procedure, for a combined capacity of 43MWdc, both located in the province of Ragusa, Sicily, with operation also expected in 2027.

The NZIA tender implements the European Net-Zero Industry Act to promote the deployment of renewable plants that use non-Chinese components, a strategic priority for the EU to try and strengthen their industrial resilience and develop an autonomous renewable supply chain.

The projects submitted by ContourGlobal under this scheme therefore aims to use European-origin components, including photovoltaic modules and inverters, contributing to the growth of manufacturing both at regional and national level.

Both the FerX and NZIA tenders are based on the awarding of 20-year Contracts for Difference (CfDs), a mechanism that aims to provide long-term revenue stability by guaranteeing a reference price and reducing exposure to market volatility. The framework facilitates access to financing and accelerates project delivery, while also generating direct benefits for end users: the electricity produced is sold at more stable prices.

Commenting in a release was Antonio Cammisecra, President and CEO of ContourGlobal: “Participation in the NZIA and FerX tenders represents a strategic milestone for ContourGlobal at a global level.

“These competitive mechanisms allow us to accelerate the deployment of new renewable capacity in key markets, and Italy plays a central role in this strategy.”

ContourGlobal in Italy

With the awards, says ContourGlobal, Italy’s strategic role for the Group’s industrial plan is consolidated.

Additionally, it reinforces ContourGlobal’s development vision, based on next-generation solar PV, battery energy storage systems (BESS), and revamping and repowering initiatives — key pillars of the company’s Italian strategy.

Said Cammisecra: “We aim to double our presence in the country by 2027 as part of our broader European growth ambitions, and these results confirm the strength of our commitment and our development, engineering, procurement and very shortly construction capabilities.”

Regarding their projects and presence in the country, ContourGlobal cites a structured development pathway combining revamping and repowering initiatives launched in 2024, together with the new capacity secured through recent tenders.

This combined has led the UK-based company to be on track to double its solar PV capacity in Italy by 2027. The company currently operates 71 plants across 14 regions and had an installed capacity of 95MWdc at the start of the programme, which is expected to reach 190MWdc by 2027.

The first phase of revamping and repowering covered approximately half of ContourGlobal’s Italian solar fleet, involving 35 plants for a total of 42MWdc. Once the second phase of repowering activities is completed, expected to increase the performance of the Italian portfolio by more than 33%, ContourGlobal’s installed capacity in Italy is projected to reach approximately 113MWdc by mid-2026.","https://enlit.stream.prepr.io/2lyo6nnka9ex/w_1600,h_900,c_center/pv-contourglobal.jpg",N,,2025-12-21 04:58:21.837090

Understanding Building Integrated Photovoltaics (BIPV)

Building Integrated Photovoltaics (BIPV) refers to solar photovoltaic systems that are directly incorporated into the building envelope, including roofs, façades, walls, windows, and skylights. Unlike conventional solar panels mounted on rooftops, BIPV replaces traditional building materials while simultaneously generating electricity.

This dual functionality offers multiple benefits: on-site renewable energy generation, reduced reliance on external power sources, improved energy efficiency, and enhanced architectural aesthetics. BIPV systems are particularly attractive in urban environments and modern construction projects where visual appeal and sustainability are equally important.

Market Dynamics Driving Growth

The rising demand for modern and sustainable architecture is a key driver of the UK building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) market. Architects and developers increasingly favor solutions that seamlessly blend renewable energy technologies into building designs without compromising aesthetics. BIPV enables clean energy generation while preserving or even enhancing the visual identity of residential and commercial structures.

Supportive government policies are also strengthening market growth. In December 2024, the UK government introduced a revised National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) aimed at streamlining planning processes and encouraging sustainable development. The updated framework simplifies approvals for new housing and infrastructure projects, indirectly supporting the integration of renewable technologies such as BIPV into construction plans.

In the residential sector, BIPV systems such as solar roof tiles and shingles are gaining popularity. These systems closely resemble conventional roofing materials, allowing homeowners to maintain architectural consistency while benefiting from renewable electricity generation. Similarly, BIPV façades and solar windows are increasingly adopted in both new buildings and renovation projects.

Cost Challenges Limiting Market Adoption

Despite its strong growth potential, the UK building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) market faces challenges related to high initial investment costs. BIPV systems remain significantly more expensive than traditional construction materials and standard rooftop solar installations.

In Europe, including the UK, BIPV system costs typically range between €200/m² and €625/m², depending on design complexity and material selection. Photovoltaic modules alone account for 43% to 77% of total system costs, while balance-of-system components such as inverters, wiring, and energy storage contribute an additional 10% to 16%. Soft costs, including system design, permitting, construction, and inspections, further increase upfront expenditure.

Customized architectural designs can push prices even higher, creating a financial barrier for developers and homeowners. Although BIPV systems offer long-term energy savings and environmental benefits, the high initial capital requirement continues to restrain wider adoption across the UK construction sector.

Market Segmentation Overview

The UK building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) market is segmented by technology, application, and end-use.

By technology, the market is categorized into crystalline silicon, thin film, and others. While crystalline silicon held the largest market share in 2024, the thin film segment is expected to grow at the fastest CAGR of 15.5% during the forecast period. Thin film BIPV systems are gaining traction due to their lightweight nature, flexibility, and ability to blend seamlessly with modern building designs. These characteristics make them ideal for façades, skylights, and curtain walls.

Based on application, the market is divided into roofs, walls, glass, façades, and others. The roofs segment is anticipated to grow at the fastest CAGR of 15.7%, driven by the large surface area available for solar integration and the practicality of replacing conventional roofing materials with energy-generating alternatives. Roof-integrated BIPV systems provide weather protection while producing electricity, making them highly attractive for residential and commercial buildings.

By end-use, the market is segmented into residential, commercial, and industrial sectors. The residential segment is projected to grow at a CAGR of 15.6%, supported by increasing homeowner interest in energy-efficient housing and government-backed retrofit programs. Initiatives such as the UK Green Homes Grant and local authority energy-efficiency schemes are encouraging the adoption of renewable technologies, including BIPV, particularly in urban residential developments where roof space is limited.

Competitive Landscape

The UK building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) market is moderately competitive, with key players focusing on innovation, customization, and partnerships with architects and construction firms. Major companies operating in the market include AGC Glass Europe, BIPVco Limited, Spirit Energy, Hanergy Thin Film Power Group Europe, Ertex Solar, Onyx Solar, Viridian Solar Ltd, Polysolar, ROMAG, and Solex Energy Ltd.

These companies are investing in advanced materials, design flexibility, and improved system efficiency to strengthen their market position and address cost-related challenges.

Future Outlook

The UK building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) market is expected to witness sustained growth over the next decade, driven by rising demand for sustainable construction, supportive planning policies, and advancements in solar technologies. As material costs decline and awareness of long-term benefits increases, BIPV is likely to become a standard feature in modern UK buildings.

With its ability to combine renewable energy generation with architectural design, BIPV represents a critical solution for achieving the UK's carbon reduction and energy efficiency targets.

An eastern North Carolina Baptist church, the Head Start program and a community college are among the entities with involuntary closures of CDL training programs in North Carolina, research from TCS shows. Of the 3,015 training providers for commercial driver’s licenses removed from the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration Training Provider Registry, 61 in North Carolina were involuntary and 17 voluntary.

Another 86 were among the nationwide 4,554 put on notice for potential noncompliance, TCS research shows. The U.S. Department of Transportation on Dec. 1 said providers receiving a notice of proposed removal have 30 days to respond and provide evidence in order to avoid removal.

The auditing process has been ongoing throughout the second term of Republican President Donald Trump. Increased scrutiny of CDL licensure programs happened after triple-fatal crashes 66 days apart involving 18-wheelers in Florida and California.

For Congress, safety is paramount in the discussion. Collateral damage, however, includes American truckers losing jobs and experiencing wage reductions from less expensive labor invading their home soil.

“If you come legally, or you have a visa, or you’re coming from one state to another, you can get a nondomiciled CDL,” Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a network interview earlier this month. “These are the licenses that these foreigners are using. But to tighten up the rules means we’re going to have more safety on American roads.

“There were 200,000 nondomiciled CDLs issued to foreigners. We think 194,000 of them were issued illegally and would not comply with our new rule.”

The bills from Harrigan and Rouzer, respectively, are the SAFE Drivers Act (House Resolution 5800), and the Non-Domiciled CDL Integrity Act (HR5688). The SAFE Drivers Act includes the acronym for Standardized Assessment for Fluency in English for Drivers Act.

Of his bill, Harrigan says, “It creates one clear national requirement so every driver meets the same baseline, and every family can trust the standards that are supposed to protect them.”

Speaking of his proposal, Rouzer said, “This legislation ensures only individuals with lawful immigration status and a legitimate reason to operate commercial vehicles in the U.S. are entrusted with CDLs. We’re closing dangerous loopholes and restoring accountability. We must never, under any circumstance, jeopardize public safety by allowing those here illegally to get behind the wheel of a big rig.”",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/thecentersquare.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/3/11/3115697a-7608-4b25-ae85-15807b9809a2/68daace871326.image.jpg,N,,2025-12-21 00:58:20.805358

The funding, delivered through the Massachusetts Clean Energy Center’s (MassCEC) Grants for Enhancing Grid Resilience and Reliability Program, will modernize local electricity infrastructure and support clean energy adoption. This initiative was developed in partnership with the state’s Department of Energy Resources (DOER) and is designed to better protect residents from the impacts of extreme weather.

By upgrading critical systems, these projects will help lower long-term energy costs for residents and businesses, create jobs, and reduce the frequency and duration of outages. This funding initiative is bolstered by federal resources under Section 40101(d) of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, illustrating Massachusetts’ commitment to establishing a cleaner, more reliable, and affordable energy future.

The initiative aims to ensure that every Massachusetts resident can benefit from this modernized grid. As the state increasingly electrifies buildings, transportation, and industries, the grid faces new challenges.

Secretary of Energy and Environmental Affairs Rebecca Tepper emphasized the importance of this funding, stating, “These projects will ensure that families can keep the lights and heat on during storms, give businesses the security to grow, and make sure our transition to clean energy is built on a foundation of reliability.”

The following projects were awarded funding through the Grants for Enhancing Grid Resilience Reliability Program:

Wakefield Municipal Gas and Light Department – $2,867,044

University of Massachusetts Amherst – $1,665,000

Marblehead Municipal Light Department – $1,328,253

Vought said the center was undergoing a ""comprehensive review"" and that any ""vital activities such as weather research will be moved to another entity or location.""
This isn't the first time the Trump administration has found itself at odds with the science community.
""Having less accurate forecasts and being more in the dark about what is coming puts lives and property at risk,"" he says.","The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development cannot impose dramatically different conditions for homelessness programs for now, according to an oral ruling Friday by U.S. District Judge Mary McElroy in Rhode Island.

McElroy granted a preliminary injunction to a group of states, cities and nonprofits who said a last minute overhaul of how to spend $4 billion on homelessness programs was unlawful. She also agreed with their argument that it likely would push many people back onto the streets in the middle of winter, causing irreparable harm.

""Continuity of housing and stability for vulnerable populations is clearly in the public interest,"" said McElroy, ordering HUD to maintain its previous funding formula.

The National Alliance to End Homelessness, one of the plaintiffs, said in a statement the order ""means that more than 170,000 people – families, seniors, veterans, and people with disabilities — have respite from the government's assault.""

HUD has sought to dramatically slash funding for permanent housing and encourage more transitional housing that mandates work and treatment for addiction or mental illness. The overhaul — announced last month — also would allow the agency to deny money to local groups that don't comply with the Trump administration's agenda on things like DEI, the restriction of transgender rights and immigration enforcement.

""HUD will continue working to provide homelessness assistance funding to grantees nationwide,"" said HUD spokeswoman Kasey Lovett in a statement to NPR. ""The Department remains committed to program reforms intended to assist our nation's most vulnerable citizens and will continue to do so in accordance with the law.""

'Chaos seems to be the point'

McElroy expressed frustration with a series of HUD actions in recent weeks. Just hours before a Dec. 8 hearing, the agency withdrew its new funding notice, saying it would make changes to address critics' concerns. But on Friday, HUD's attorney said the new version would not be ready until the end of the day.

""The timing seems to be strategic,"" McElroy said, asserting there was no reason the document could not have been ready before the hearing. ""The constant churn and chaos seems to be the point.""

In defending the agency, attorney John Bailey said HUD was simply trying to change its policies to reflect President Donald Trump's executive orders, which he called ""legal directives."" The judge interjected repeatedly to explain that he was conflating things, noting Congress — not the president — makes laws.

'It's kind of shocking'

HUD's changes were announced in November with little notice and only weeks before local homeless service providers must apply for new funding.

""Our agencies are just scrambling right now to try to respond,"" said Pam Johnson with Minnesota Community Action Partnership, whose members provide housing and other services for homeless people. ""It also just reverses 40 years of bipartisan work on proven solutions to homelessness. So it's really, it's kind of shocking.""

For decades, U.S. policy favored permanent housing with optional treatment for addiction or mental illness Years of research has found the strategy is effective at keeping people off the streets.

But many conservatives argue it's failed to stop record rates of homelessness.

""What is the root cause of homelessness? Mental illness, drug addiction, drug abuse,"" HUD Secretary Scottt Turner said recently on Fox Business Network. ""During the Biden administration, it was just warehousing. It was a homeless industrial complex.""

Turner and others who support the changes say the goal is to push people towards self-sufficiency.

But local advocates say mental health and substance abuse are not the main factors driving homelessness.

""It's poverty. Poverty, low income and significant lack of affordable housing,"" says Julie Embree, who heads the Toledo Lucas County Homelessness Board in Ohio.

Many in permanent housing have disabilities that make it hard to work full time, she said. Embree agrees with Trump administration goals like efficiency and saving money, but says pushing people back into homelessness, where they're more likely to land in jail, the courts or a hospital, is not cost-effective.

""One emergency room visit is just as expensive as a month of sustaining this [permanent housing] program,"" she said.

In Los Angeles, Stephanie Klasky-Gamer with LA Family Housing said there is a need for more transitional housing, but not at the expense of long-term housing. And the idea that programs could simply switch from one to the other is not only unrealistic, it's illegal.

""You cannot take a building that has a 75-year deed restriction and just — ding! — call it interim housing,"" she said.

Those challenging HUD say providers who own such properties – or states who've invested millions of dollars in permanent housing projects — face ""significant financial jeopardy"" if their funding is not renewed.

In addition to the legal challenges, members of Congress from both parties have questioned HUD's sudden shift on homelessness. Advocates have lobbied lawmakers to step in and, at the least, push for more time to prepare for such a massive overhaul.

President Donald Trump said the administration has reached agreements with nine more drugmakers to bring their U.S. drug prices more in line with what other wealthy countries pay.

Fourteen companies in total have now reached what the administration calls most-favored-nation pricing deals. The companies that took part in Friday's announcement were: Amgen, Boehringer Ingelheim, Bristol Myers Squibb, Genentech, Gilead Sciences, GSK, Merck, Novartis and Sanofi.

They agreed to charge the U.S. government no more for new drugs than the prices paid by other well-off countries. The agreements will allow state Medicaid programs to access lower prices from the nine companies. In a statement, the White House said the change will result ""in billions of dollars in savings.""

The drugmakers also agreed to invest at least $150 billion in manufacturing operations in the U.S. The president is seeking to increase domestic production of pharmaceuticals.

In addition, the companies agreed to make some of their most popular drugs available at lower prices to consumers who pay out of pocket through a government website called TrumpRx.com. The TrumpRx website is expected to launch in early 2026, and would take consumers to pharmaceutical companies' direct-to-consumer websites to fulfill orders.

For example, Merck will reduce the price of Januvia, a medication for Type 2 diabetes, from $330 to $100 for patients purchasing directly through TrumpRx, the White House said. Amgen will reduce the price of Repatha, a cholesterol-lowering drug, from $573 to $239 when purchased through TrumpRx.

In exchange for these concessions, the companies will be exempt from possible administration tariffs for three years.

The extent of savings for consumers under the agreements is unclear. Medicaid and its beneficiaries already pay some of the lowest prices for drugs. And people with health insurance could spend less on copays for their medicines than paying cash for them through the drugmakers.

Separately, Trump said during the press event that he would like to get health insurers to lower their prices, too.

""I'm going to call a meeting of the insurance companies,"" he said. ""I'm going to see if they [will] get their price down, to put it very bluntly.""

America's new top health diplomat is Bethany Kozma.

The job she took on this week — leading the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Global Affairs — does not have a high profile. And Kozma herself is not a familiar name in the world of public health.

But it is a position with power — and Kozma has a record of public statements and activism on health issues, equating abortion with ""murder"" and campaigning against gender-affirming care.

The office sometimes is referred to as the ""diplomatic voice"" of HHS. As director, Kozma will have considerable influence over how the U.S. shapes health policy in other countries in the wake of the Trump administration's foreign aid cuts and withdrawal from the World Health Organization.

Kozma declined to be interviewed for this story. She doesn't appear to have a background in global health based on publicly available information online. The HHS website offers few details about her professional profile. In response to questions about her qualifications and vision for the role, HHS responded with this statement.

""The Office of Global Affairs (OGA) advances the Trump administration's agenda and priorities by bringing common sense, transparency and gold-standard science to global partners. Under Secretary Kennedy's leadership, OGA is committed to strengthening the United States' position as the global gold-standard for public health and ensuring Americans are protected at home and abroad.""

Who is Bethany Kozma?

Kozma began her career in public service during the George W. Bush administration, working at the White House Homeland Security Council. During the Obama years, she re-entered public life as an activist.

In a 2016 commentary for The Daily Signal, a conservative news website founded by the Heritage Foundation, she argued against the Obama administration's guidance that public schools should allow children to use the bathroom that comports with their identity.

""This radical agenda of subjective 'gender fluidity' and unrestricted shower and bathroom access actually endangers all,"" she stated, noting that ""predators"" could abuse the policy.

In 2017, she joined the Trump administration as senior adviser for Gender Equality and Women's Empowerment in the United States Agency for International Development, eventually being promoted to deputy chief of staff. In videos obtained and released by ProPublica, Kozma recalls calling the U.S. a ""pro-life"" country in a closed-door U.N. meeting about women's rights in 2018, when access to abortion still was protected nationally by Roe v. Wade.

In August 2020, Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., and four other Democratic senators issued a letter labeling Kozma and several other political appointees at USAID as ""prejudiced"" and called for them to be removed from their posts. Kozma has ""spoken extensively and derisively of trans people and trans issues,"" the senators wrote.

During the Biden administration, she also was involved in Project 2025, the Heritage Foundation's ""blueprint"" for a new Republican administration. She played a prominent role in Project 2025 training videos, obtained and published by ProPublica.

In one nearly 50-minute training video focused on left-wing language, she called for a Republican administration to ""eradicate 'climate change' references from absolutely everywhere,"" and said that concerns over climate change are efforts at ""population control."" She also called gender-affirming care ""absolutely infuriating"" and said ""the idea that gender is fluid is evil."" Overall, she argued that changing language around these policies should be a priority for political appointees.

Kozma joined the second Trump administration as a chief adviser at the HHS Office of Global Affairs. In September, she spoke at a U.N. event commemorating the 30th anniversary of the declaration that denying women's rights is a human rights violation.

""While many may celebrate so-called successes gained for women over the last 30 years, one must ask what defines true success for women?"" she began, adding that ""biological reality is rooted in scientific truth and is confirmed by the universal truths that we are endowed by our creator who made us 'male and female.'""

Those views can be divisive but have garnered some support for Kozma's promotion.

""Bethany is an excellent pick for global affairs at HHS,"" says Roger Servino, vice president of domestic policy at The Heritage Foundation. ""She was an early champion of protecting children from gender ideology back when the medical establishment was able to silence voices of reason and dissent and she is perfectly placed to help push back on global health bodies trying to impose left wing pseudoscience on the American people and the world.""

What will her goals be at the Office of Global Affairs?

Kozma is taking over as director of the HHS Office of Global Affairs at a time of drastic change for global health.

In previous administrations, a main focus of the office was dealing with the World Health Organization. Typically, the director, who usually has a background in public health, is involved in negotiations on sharing data for pathogen surveillance or developing vaccine policy, for example.

After President Trump withdrew the U.S. from WHO, the administration has started a new strategy: striking deals with individual countries to give health aid in exchange for their meeting certain policy prescriptions. Kozma has been involved in some of those negotiations, but the details aren't quite finalized.

Some reproductive rights advocates believe Kozma will use her new position to insert anti-abortion and anti-LGBTQ policies into these agreements.

""[Kozma] is vehemently anti-trans, anti-LGBTQI+, anti-abortion,"" says Keifer Buckingham, managing director at the Council on Global Equality, a coalition of advocacy organizations that focuses on LGBTQ issues. ""For those of us who want to ensure that the provision of U.S. foreign assistance and health doesn't discriminate against people based on who they are, [Kozma's appointment] raises a lot of red flags.""

One particular worry is about the Helms Amendment, a U.S. policy that prohibits foreign aid being used to fund abortion services.

""There's been speculation that there's an intention by the U.S. government to expand the Helms Amendment beyond abortion to include LGBTQ's as well,"" says Musoba Kitui, director of Ipas Africa Alliance, a non-profit that works to provide access to abortion and contraception. He's concerned that health groups that serve those populations could lose funding. That speculation is backed up by reporting from The Daily Signal that the administration is planning to prohibit U.S. aid funding for ""gender ideology and diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.""

Given LGBTQ people are often at higher risk for diseases like HIV, such policies could make these communities even more vulnerable, says Kitui.

""We could see more marginalization, inequality, spikes of infection,"" he says. While many African governments signing these deals understand those dynamics, Kitui says they may still agree to more restrictive conditions as aid cuts have ""starved health systems to a point of desperation.""

The White House plans to break up a key weather and climate research center in Colorado, a move experts say could jeopardize the accuracy of forecasting and prediction systems.

It's the latest climate-related move by President Donald Trump, who has called climate change a hoax, cut funding for climate research and removed climate and weather scientists from their posts across the federal government. During his first term, Trump famously contradicted the nation's weather forecasting service by redrawing Hurricane Dorian's path on a map with a Sharpie.

White House Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought, in a post Tuesday on X, announced the plan to dismantle the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) in Boulder, calling it ""one of the largest sources of climate alarmism in the country."" NCAR was founded more than six decades ago to provide universities with expertise and resources for collaborative research on global weather, water and climate challenges.

Vought said the center was undergoing a ""comprehensive review"" and that any ""vital activities such as weather research will be moved to another entity or location.""

Antonio Busalacchi, who heads the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research, a nonprofit consortium of 129 U.S. universities that oversees the Boulder facility, told NPR he received no prior notice before the announcement and believes the decision ""is entirely political.""

NCAR's job is to study both climate and weather, and Busalacchi says the two cannot be understood separately.

""Our job is to state what the science is, and it's for others to interpret what the significance of that science is,"" he says. ""We're very careful not to cross over that line to advocacy or policy prescription.""

Plan faces a political backlash

Vought's announcement drew an immediate response from Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, a Democrat, who said in a statement that if the White House goes ahead with the plan, ""public safety is at risk and science is being attacked.""

Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., and Rep. Joe Neguse, a Democrat whose district includes Boulder, have suggested that the proposed NCAR closure amounts to political brinkmanship by the White House in response to Colorado's refusal to release Tina Peters. Peters, a former Mesa County clerk, is serving a nine-year prison sentence for illegally accessing voting machines after the 2020 election. A Republican, Peters was recently pardoned by Trump, a largely symbolic action since she has neither been charged nor convicted in federal court.

""The judgement is that this is very much about Tina Peters,"" Bennet told local media in Colorado. ""And that the president attempted to get his way through intimidation and he hasn't gotten his way and he is trying to punish Colorado as a result.""

In a joint statement, Bennett, Neguse and U.S. Sen. John Hickenlooper called the administration's plan ""deeply dangerous and blatantly retaliatory.""

NPR reached out to Vought's Office of Management and Budget but received no response. The White House press office did not answer specific questions, including one asking if ""breaking up"" NCAR meant it would be closed. But in a statement, the White House said, ""NCAR's activities veer far from strong or useful science,"" adding that the center was being dismantled ""to eliminate Green New Scam research activities.""

American Meteorological Society President David Stensrud says he has used NCAR weather models throughout his career.

""I think the work that I and others have done have led to the improvements that we see [in] … weather predictions,"" he says. ""Losing that [will cause] a great deal of hurt in terms of our ability to continue to improve forecasts and the future.""

The 'beating heart' of climate and weather science

Among NCAR's many contributions, in the 1960s, it developed dropsondes — tube-shaped instruments released from aircraft, including hurricane hunters, to measure temperature, pressure, humidity and wind. In the 1980s, the center helped develop and refine technology to monitor wind shear at airports.

Busalacchi says these efforts have contributed to decades without passenger plane crashes caused by wind shear or downbursts.

""We've had zero loss of life from these weather events that can be directly attributed to our research. And that's what we're talking about losing"" if NCAR shuts down, he says.

NCAR, which employs about 830 people, is also known for developing and maintaining tools such as the Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF), which is used around the world to predict everything from thunderstorms to large-scale systems, including hurricanes and frontal systems. NCAR's Community Earth Systems Model (CESM) is also widely used by scientists, including Jason Furtado, an associate professor of meteorology at the University of Oklahoma.

Furtado says he and his colleagues have used the model to run experiments ""to look for where in the atmosphere and ocean we get long-range signals for extreme cold air outbreaks"" such as the February 2021 event that hit the midsection of the country, resulting in sub-zero temperatures for days and the total breakdown of the electrical grid in central Texas. ""We've used [CESM] and come up with some really important research,"" Furtado says.

He calls NCAR ""a world-envied research center for atmospheric science"" and ""a beating heart for the atmospheric science community."" He says his research and that of many other scientists would simply not be possible without the Boulder center. ""In some way every atmospheric scientist has a connection to NCAR, whether they've directly been to the building or they have not,"" he says.

Ken Davis, a professor of atmospheric and climate science at Penn State, did research at NCAR from the time he was a graduate student until after his postdoc. He says NCAR plays a critical role in providing its members with cutting-edge computing resources, observational resources and scientific expertise ""which no university can provide on its own.""

""If any investigator anywhere in the country wants to request a research aircraft … NCAR will take a look at that proposal and say, 'Yeah, we can do that,' "" Davis says. ""As a university investigator, I can show up with an instrumented C-130 [aircraft] to do a whole bunch of airborne research, which would be totally impossible without this facility to support the community.""

This isn't the first time the Trump administration has found itself at odds with the science community. In April, the administration dismissed scientists working on the country's flagship climate report and then removed the report from a government website.

In 2019, Trump landed himself in a scandal known as ""Sharpiegate,"" in which he contradicted official National Weather Service forecasts for Hurricane Dorian by insisting the storm directly threatened Alabama. He later displayed an Oval Office map showing an altered storm path that appeared to have been drawn with a black marker. Earlier this year, the Senate approved the nomination of Neil Jacobs, a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) official cited for misconduct related to the episode, to lead the agency.

In its 2026 budget plan, the White House has also proposed cutting NOAA's budget by about 27% and eliminating NOAA's Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research, the agency's core climate and weather research branch. The administration also has rolled back National Science Foundation funding for climate science.

Ultimately, closing NCAR wouldn't have an immediate impact on weather forecasting, Furtado says. Instead, he says, it would slowly erode the scientific community's ability to make further progress on understanding weather and climate.

""We can either accept the facts and work on ways to mitigate and adapt, or ignore the data and not be ready for the changing world we have,"" Furtado says.

The episode, which released on Monday, caught fire on social media after Talarico delivered a pointed reframing of conservative rhetoric about welfare spending. In a sharp challenge to long-standing political talking points about “welfare queens”—a term traditionally used to disparage low-income individuals receiving government benefits—Talarico flipped the script, arguing that the nation’s actual dependency on public resources flows upward, not downward.

“The biggest welfare queens in this country are the giant corporations that don’t pay a penny in federal taxes,” he said. He also extended his critique to include wealthy executives, adding “the biggest welfare queens are the CEOs who get a tax deduction for flying on a private jet.”

Corporate tax avoidance as hidden welfare

Talarico’s argument strikes at a real issue: Some of America’s largest corporations have legally structured their tax arrangements to minimize or eliminate federal income tax liability. This practice has drawn scrutiny from policymakers across the political spectrum and sparked ongoing debates about tax code reform. ​ So, rather than accepting that welfare is primarily a lower-income issue, he argues the problem is systemic and benefits the wealthy.

Talarico said his background as a middle school language arts teacher at Rhodes Middle School in San Antonio informed many of his policy positions.

“I was a public school teacher, so I saw how when kids showed up hungry, they couldn’t learn,” he told local ABC affiliate KSAT in October. “Even my brightest students, even my hardest working students couldn’t succeed. Couldn’t pull themselves up by their bootstraps when they didn’t have boots.” ​

To illustrate the point, he invoked a metaphor about teaching someone to fish: “If you’re gonna take your friend out on a boat for the day to teach him how to fish, you wanna make sure he had breakfast that morning. You wanna make sure he’s not sick, because that allows him to learn how to fish again,” he said. ​

A platform around corporate accountability

Since his election to the Texas House in 2018 at age 28, Talarico has positioned himself as a champion of legislation targeting corporate and pharmaceutical industry practices. He was instrumental in passing legislation capping insulin copays at $25 per month in Texas and enabling the importation of lower-cost medications from Canada.

His Senate campaign messaging appears to hinge on this core idea: that fairness and personal responsibility should apply equally to billionaires and working people.

“We don’t want dependency. We want to reward hard work. And I think that should apply to those billionaires, not just working people,” he said during the recent taping.

Notably, the company reported solid prospects from data centers, which drive higher energy demand. FCEL says its sales and marketing focus is centered around data center operations and engaging with data center operators and infrastructure finance providers to make it clear that FuelCell is equipped to power their energy-intensive applications.

As AI demand accelerates, the company expects to increase production, creating a clear path to profitability. Believing that once it reaches an annualized production rate of 100 megawatts, it will translate into positive adjusted EBITDA.

About FuelCell Stock

Danbury, Connecticut-based FuelCell is a leader in developing stationary fuel cell platforms for sustainable, efficient power production. The company designs, manufactures, installs, operates, and services megawatt-scale systems powered by molten carbonate technology, generating ultra-clean electricity with minimal emissions.

These versatile platforms enable carbon capture and sequestration, hydrogen and water production, plus long-duration energy storage solutions customized for utilities, industries, and municipalities. Founded in 1969, FuelCell Energy advances reliable fuel cell innovations to support global clean energy needs and environmental goals. The company has a market capitalization of $269.34 million.

The stock has been volatile on Wall Street amid broader market volatility. Adding to the pressure is the new tax legislation, also called the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA). The new tax regime significantly curbs the clean hydrogen production credit under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), requiring facilities to begin construction by January 1, 2028, to remain eligible.

Over the past 52 weeks, FuelCell’s stock has dropped by 10.6%. However, over the past six months, it has gained 37.17%. The stock had reached a 52-week high of $13.98 in January, but is down 40% from that level. It reached a 52-week low of $3.58 in May and is up 133% from that level.

FuelCell’s stock is trading at a lower valuation than its peers. Its price-to-sales ratio of 1.36x is lower than the industry average of 1.81x.

FuelCell’s Q4 Results Were Better Than Expected

On Dec. 18, FuelCell reported its fourth-quarter and fiscal year 2025 (the period that ended on Oct. 31). The company’s quarterly revenue increased 12% year-over-year (YOY) to $55.02 million, which is higher than the $43.96 million that Wall Street analysts had expected.

The top line growth was driven by product revenue increasing 18% from the prior year’s period to $30.03 million. This was based on the company recording $30 million in revenue from its extended service contract with Gyeonggi Green Energy Co., Ltd. (GGE), covering the supply and activation of 10 fuel cell units for GGE’s 58.8 MW power facility in Hwaseong-si, South Korea.

FuelCell reported that it has streamlined its product lineup, increased efficiency, and incorporated absorption chilling to manage thermal loads, which is essential for high-compute environments.​ The company has also become seemingly more cost-efficient, as its bottom line losses are declining.

Its adjusted EBITDA loss was $17.68 million, down by 30% YOY. FuelCell’s adjusted net loss per share for Q4 was $0.83, down 55% from the prior-year period’s per-share loss of $1.85, and lower than the $1.03 per-share loss that Street analysts had expected.

The company announced that it took “proactive measures” to strengthen its balance sheet and bolster its liquidity. As of Oct. 31, FuelCell had $278.10 million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents. It also had a total backlog of $1.19 billion, $30.41 million higher than it was a year ago.

What Do Analysts Think About FuelCell Stock?

Wall Street analysts have a mixed view about FuelCell Energy’s bottom-line trajectory. For the current fiscal year (fiscal 2026), analysts expect the company’s loss per share to reduce by 29.3% YOY to $3.12, followed by losses deepening by 42.6% to $4.45 per share in the following fiscal year.

After the Q4 earnings report, Street analysts have not noticeably changed their stance on FuelCell’s stock. Experts at Canaccord Genuity recently reiterated their “Hold” rating and $12 price target. Despite acknowledging FuelCell's upside potential, Canaccord Genuity analysts noted that the company must demonstrate that its data center initiatives will deliver “tangible outcomes.”

Meanwhile, TD Cowen analysts reaffirmed their “Hold” rating but raised the price target from $7 to $9. This indicates that while sentiment remains tepid, it may be improving in the near future.

Wall Street analysts are taking a cautious stance on FuelCell’s stock now, with a consensus “Hold” rating overall. Of the nine analysts rating the stock, one analyst gave a “Strong Buy” rating, while six analysts are playing it safe with a “Hold” rating, and two analysts gave a “Strong Sell” rating. The consensus price target of $7.84 represents an 6% downside from current levels. However, the Street-high Canaccord Genuity-given price target of $12 indicates a 43.9% upside from current levels.

Key Takeaways

Data center demand is expected to keep FuelCell’s operations robustly buoyed. However, the company continues to report losses and needs to scale its operations to achieve profitability. Therefore, it might be wise to observe the stock for now.",,N,,2025-12-20 21:58:57.618529

Telematics use data gathered from sensors embedded in a vehicle to monitor its operations. When collected and interpreted correctly, that data can be used to improve fleet safety, boost operational efficiency, and enable predictive maintenance that reduces (if not eliminates) unexpected downtime. Those are real benefits, with some analysts showing up to 30% savings in repair costs even before you factor in the fuel savings from EVs that, according to MAN CEO Alexander Vlaskamp, will cover the added cost of a BEV in less than three years.

As you can imagine, that’s a big business – and the global market for vehicle telematic platforms is projected to reach an impressive $127 billion in the next decade, and the rush is on to get OEMs like Ford (through Ford Pro) and Volvo (who has a deal with Geotab) to integrate digital solutions into their vehicles.

We originally covered these topics back in February, ahead of the ACT Expo. You can read that original article, below, and let us know what you think of the OEMs’ telematics’

Advertisement - scroll for more content

Last month, Geotab signed a deal with Volvo Group to integrate the manufacturer’s vehicle data API into Geotab’s telematics platform. It’s the latest in a recent onslaught of such deals between telematics providers and OEMs that begs the question: what’s in it for the OEMs?

Almost all modern cars and trucks are “connected” in some way. Ford, for example, began fitting the FordPass Connect modem on all its vehicles in the 2020 model year, and the vehicle (and driver) data gathered powers the Ford Pro fleet management platform and enables offerings like the company’s E-Switch Assist, which enables Ford fleet managers to identify which of its ICE-powered F-150 and Transit assets are ready to make the switch to EV.

“Smart tools informed by data like E-Switch Assist are opening up many new conversations with our commercial customers large and small about EV readiness; we’re already using E-Switch Assist regularly in consultations to help organizations determine if electric trucks and vans are right for them,” says Nate McDonald, EV strategy and cross vehicle brand manager at Ford Pro. “The importance of these tools and technologies goes beyond selling a customer a new vehicle—it changes mindsets about whether electric vehicles will work for their business while potentially saving them time and money.”

So, it makes sense for manufacturers to build that connectivity into their vehicles and makes even more sense to use that data connection to populate a fleet management dashboard that makes it painless for fleet managers to monitor their assets within a trusted ecosystem. Think Android vs. iPhone, and the pain that would go into switching from one to the other after a decade or so of constant interaction – because that’s how the OEMs are looking at it.

Why, then, would an OEM open up that data stream to a third party like Geotab?

The answer, presumably, is that that data sharing is a two-way street: the manufacturer’s are opening up their APIs to Geotab, and Geotab is sharing at least some of the data from other manufacturers with their industry partners.

And Geotab has a lot of partners:

In 2019, Geotab began working with Ford to integrate Ford’s telematics data into its fleet management platform

In 2020, Geotab began integrating with GM and its OnStar telematics in North American markets

In 2022, Geotab began partnering with Stellantis’ Free2move car sharing brand, providing full telematics integration into the MyGeotab platform in North America

In April of 2024, Geotab partnered with Mobilisights to integrate data from Stellantis’ European brands, including Opel, Fiat, Alfa Romeo, Citroën, and Peugeot

In September of 2024, Geotab announced a new partnership with VW Group Info Services aimed at improving the company’s data integration across its brands

A deal with Rivian, VW’s partner in a $5 billion joint software venture, followed soon after

All of those players are convinced that the data coming from their vehicles can produce enough value to seriously impact fleet ROI.

Fleet managers seem convinced, too. In a recent McKinsey survey, nearly 57% of EV buyers said they were willing to switch brands in order to get better connectivity features. And, if you’ve ever worked in “a Ford shop” or “a Chevy shop” you already know what a huge that deal that number might be to an OEM.

McKinsey connectivity survey

In that point of view, working with a trusted, universal platform like Geotab who doesn’t have a dog in the vehicle sales fight makes sense. If the Ford Transit the fleet buyer is looking at plays well with their fleet auditing software and systems and the Nissan NV doesn’t – well, it doesn’t really matter if Nissan’s fleetail guy is giving you a better deal at that point. It’s just too painful to operate a second dashboard for one subset of assets.

The man-hours saved with a universal and brand agnostic fleet management platform may not be the easiest to trace all the way to the bottom line, but they’re there.

Additionally, the Geotab dashboard can be configured to collect and even analyze data that’s specifically relevant to EVs. Information like charging history, and regenerative braking efficiency, and overall battery health – data that, over thousands of vehicles, can give fleet managers real insight into how long the new electric vehicles they’re considering will last compared to the gas and diesel vehicles they have experience with.

Geotab research shows that EV batteries could last 20 years or more if they degrade at an average rate of 1.8% per year, as we have observed.

According to our data, the simple answer is that the vast majority of batteries will outlast the usable life of the vehicle and will never need to be replaced. If an average EV battery degrades at 1.8% per year, it will still have over 80% state of health after 12 years, generally beyond the usual life of a fleet vehicle.

GEOTAB

Telematics integrations can also help optimize a fleet’s charging schedules, both by scheduling EV charging for lower priced, off-peak hours and by identifying the most dependable high-speed charging stations along regular routes to minimize down time for both vehicles and drivers.

Finally, these data-driven platforms can provide fleet managers tools for tracking and reporting things like carbon emissions and overall energy consumption, which can streamline ESG reporting processes and make it easier for the worker bees to get regulators, administrators, and managers the sort of charts, tables, and graphs they love.

Something like that, anyway.

The White House has supported the general effort in Congress to streamline the federal permitting process, which frequently adds years to the time it takes to build projects. But Trump has dismissed the issue of affordability as a “hoax” — despite polls showing the issue is a top concern of voters — and the White House’s engagement with Congress on the legislation has been mostly limited to providing technical advice.

Proponents view boosting the production and delivery of all sources of domestic energy as necessary for tackling the affordability crisis. Data released Thursday showed consumers’ power prices have climbed by 7.4 percent over the previous 12 months, while their natural gas costs are up 6.9 percent — both well above overall inflation.

Room for any legislative compromise is narrow, however. One reason is that House conservatives oppose including language that would protect renewable energy, while Democrats fear that Trump wouldn’t abide by any congressional limits on his power to block solar and wind projects.

Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), a close Trump ally, said the president should embrace a potential compromise that relaxes environmental statutes but allows renewable energy projects that are under development to complete their permitting.

“If we do something big and bipartisan, it is pretty easy to argue that it is going to be good for affordability,” Cramer told POLITICO. “There’s room for everybody to brag about it if we do it successfully. And if we don’t, it gets blamed on us. But it would require leadership from the administration. We can’t do it without them.”

Green power supporters, meanwhile, would have to accept the reality that a permitting overhaul means faster approval for oil and gas.

“The path to permitting has always required bipartisanship, and this was always going to be about the adults in the room,” said Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii). “People need to let go of the idea that this bill is going to be an opportunity to either vanquish clean energy, or vanquish fossil energy.”

That task got even harder after House GOP leaders made concessions to appease foes of offshore wind before passing their permitting bill, known as the SPEED Act.

“Everybody says permitting reform has to happen, and it should be technology neutral,” said Rep. Andrew Garbarino (R-N.Y.). “And if it’s something that 300 members out of 435 want something done, it shouldn’t be up to four or five to derail that.”

To get the votes of hardliners in their party, GOP leaders weakened a part of the bill that was intended to curb the power of presidents to revoke permits. The change would allow the Trump administration to continue to try to block previously approved offshore wind projects. That move prompted one clean energy industry group to yank its support for the bill — and irked Democrats who said Congress should be clearing away red tape for all kinds of energy.

“It’s unfortunate the far right feels that they want to get everything,” said Sen. John Hickenlooper (D-Colo.). “They don’t want to compromise. Then you get nothing.”

But Natural Resources Chair Bruce Westerman (R-Ark.), the architect of the bill, argued that the measure’s bipartisan support — 11 Democrats voted for it — created momentum for the Senate to act.

“We got the best vote we could get passed out of the House,” Westerman said Thursday. “We said our goal was to have a bipartisan permitting bill in the Senate before the end of the year and we did it. We’ve sent them a really good piece of legislation.”

Energy Secretary Chris Wright told POLITICO this week that he has been in conversations with lawmakers and personally supports the SPEED Act, and that the Trump administration “wants to get bipartisan permitting reform done.”

He said finding a compromise on limiting executive branch interference in the permitting process would require a “balance.”

Passage of the SPEED Act was the centerpiece of a legislative package pushed by House Republicans, which included several of their long-held priorities they contend are needed to expand U.S. energy output. That bill would limit the scope of permitting reviews and sharply restrict legal challenges under the National Environmental Policy Act, a bedrock environmental protection law that Republicans and some Democrats believe has been misused by environmental groups and state governments to block projects.

Now, Democrats and some moderate House Republicans who were unhappy with the late concessions to the hardliners said they hope the Senate will negotiate a more bipartisan product that strengthens protections for clean energy.

“I certainly am going to be a strong advocate with the Senate that any final product that gets back here for us to vote on would be inclusive,” said Rep. Adam Gray (D-Calif.), who voted for the SPEED Act despite concerns that the last-minute changes were “counterproductive.”

“We need to build if we’re going to address our problems, both from an affordability perspective as well as a reliability perspective,” Gray added. “We’ve got to build out clean energy. We’ve got to also leverage our traditional oil and gas.”

If the Senate works out a compromise, it would fall to House Speaker Mike Johnson to steer the bill past the hardliners’ opposition.

Some Democrats were not optimistic.

“Serious permitting reform cannot happen on their [GOP] watch,” said Rep. Jared Huffman (D-Calif.). “It has to happen under Democratic leadership. The Freedom Caucus and the oil and gas folks are just never going to let a true bipartisan solution move. Mike Johnson won’t allow it.”

Even as top Republican leaders have remained mum, GOP lawmakers are well aware of what the issue could mean for them in next year’s elections.

“This is the single biggest thing for affordability,” said Sen. John Curtis (R-Utah). “If you get energy prices down, it’s a big deal.”

The urgency has only grown since several previous failed efforts to relax cumbersome federal permitting rules. That’s raised concerns among industry groups and their members about a supply crunch caused in part by rising power demand from the AI boom.

Among the groups calling for Congress to act to update permitting laws are the American Petroleum Institute, Clean Energy Buyers Association, National Association of Manufacturers and the Data Center Coalition.

“I don’t think I’ve seen the support for permitting reform come from so many different angles,” said Senate Environment and Public Works Chair Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), a key negotiator. “You just can’t build fast enough. It’s hitting every aspect. It’s just a much larger support group.”

The permitting debate is also complicated by the fact that many projects must go through a thicket of state and local approvals, on top of the federal ones. Projects of all types are increasingly facing public opposition from landowners.

GOP policy proposals have tended to focus on easing the requirements of environmental laws while Democrats have focused their effort on smoothing approvals for interstate power lines that could send clean energy long distances. Meanwhile, the hardening partisanship of Trump’s second term has made it harder to meet in the middle.

“It’s no secret that there’s not necessarily a ton of trust between Democrats in Congress and the administration,” said Rep. Josh Harder (D-Calif.), who co-chairs the new bipartisan Build America Caucus.

Much of the distrust has centered on Trump’s assault on renewable energy projects, including the administration’s efforts to revoke already-issued permits and stall once-routine approvals.

Democrats say Trump’s blocking of solar and wind projects — the fastest-growing sources on the electricity grid — risks putting more pressure on power prices, and they are seeking to impose restrictions on presidential meddling in the permitting process in any deal with Republicans.

“Democrats would be insane to offer up a bill to President Trump without the clean energy guardrails that we’ve been trying to put in,” Huffman said. “You’re simply giving them more authority and tools to kill off clean energy in its current form.”

Republican hardliners are adamant, though, the Congress must not hamper Trump’s authority to block renewables, particularly offshore wind. They want to speed up the federal permitting process only for fossil fuels.

“The president is probably the only person alive who hates these wind turbines more than I do,” said Republican Rep. Jeff Van Drew, whose home state of New Jersey has been a focus for offshore wind farms. He added, “We don’t have to have wind turbines in order to get the permitting [reform] for oil and gas.”

Permitting proponents like Westerman and Capito have proposed a neutral approach that would hasten approvals for all energy sources, regardless of the type of technology.

That message is also meant to appeal to Democrats who are increasingly embracing an “all of the above” approach instead of only embracing climate-friendly sources, in order to capitalize on Trump’s anti-renewables bias.

“In order for permitting reform to happen, it has to be a bipartisan ‘all of the above’ approach,” said Rep. Seth Magaziner (D-R.I.). “We need to put making life more affordable for Americans ahead of politics, and that’s going to require a culture change on both sides of the aisle.”

Even as the House GOP passed the SPEED Act, more challenges await when the issue moves to the Senate in the new year.

That effort would require at least seven Democratic votes — along with universal Republican support.

Along with changes to the NEPA process, including by limiting legal challenges against projects, a broader deal between the Senate and House would also probably modify the Clean Water Act to smooth oil and gas pipeline project approvals — a key Republican demand that Democrats have resisted in the past. And it would have to include measures to facilitate the development of interstate transmission lines needed to help bring clean energy onto the nation’s power grid — a top priority of Democrats that House Republicans have bristled at.

“It’s going to be hard,” Capito said. “So it won’t be as big [of a deal] as we would want, but I still think we’ll get there.”",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F1c%2F52%2Fc08273be4a1590330dcf1d377582%2Freferendum-public-utility-91823.jpg,N,,2025-12-20 16:59:36.031774

95% for sulfur dioxide (SO2).

74% for carbon monoxide (CO).

71% for nitrogen oxides (NOx).

48% for fine particles (PM2.5).

67% for volatile organic compounds (VOCs).

The state said the measured concentrations of those pollutants have been below every federal health-based standard for more than a decade, with average concentrations of SO2 95% below the federal standard and nitrogen dioxide 89% below the standard. According to data from the state, CO, NOx and VOC emissions have declined by 81%, 72% and 85%, respectively, from 1990 through 2022, from those on-road sources of air pollution.

The state added it expects to see futher reductions from the transportation sector in the coming years due to increasing adoption of electric vehicles.

NCDEQ in their report state that cars, trucks and other vehicles on North Carolina roads emit far less pollution than older vehicles, which they said is attributed to improved engine and fuel standards and more advanced emissions controls.

More of the state’s power now comes from clean sources such as solar, wind and nuclear energy, and NCDEQ said the state’s transition away from coal for power generation has been a major driver of these changes.

Two analyses of national energy data found that electricity price hikes are expected pretty much across the board.

MoneyGeek, which used data from the National Energy Assistance Directors Association for its report, found homes that rely on electric heating can expect to pay 10% more this winter, on average.

Another analysis by This Old House (using U.S. Energy Information Administration data) drilled into the price hikes by state. The report estimated the biggest electricity bill increases this winter will be in:

Maryland ($38 increase)

West Virginia ($38 increase)

Alabama ($35 increase)

Virginia ($34 increase)

Connecticut ($33 increase)

Delaware ($32 increase)

Tennessee ($32 increase)

Hawaii ($30 increase)

Kentucky ($30 increase)

South Carolina ($30 increase)

When it comes to natural gas-heated homes, there’s some better news. Roughly half of homes that rely on it for a heat source shouldn’t see a major change this winter, as the price of natural gas is pretty flat year-over-year, according to This Old House.

One region, however, is an exception. Homes in the Midwest that rely on natural gas for heat could see bills creep up by about $3 to $8 per month, MoneyGeek predicts.

The states expected to see those smaller increases in natural gas heating bills are: Missouri, Michigan, Minnesota, Illinois, Ohio, Kansas, Indiana, Wisconsin, Nebraska, North Dakota, Iowa and South Dakota. Every other state is projected to see natural gas heating costs stay flat or even decrease, according to This Old House.

That doesn’t mean bills will be cheap – just marginally cheaper. States in the Northeast face the highest bills overall thanks to their cold weather and older homes that cost more to heat. Homes in Massachusetts and Connecticut have heating costs that top $1,000 over the winter, on average, estimates This Old House. Rhode Island, Alaska and New York aren’t far behind.

It took almost all year, but last month Gov. Josh Shapiro and the General Assembly finally agreed on a state budget. After 135 days of deadlock, it’s understandable that the predominant response to the deal and consequent resumption of funding critical government services has been one of relief. It’s to be expected that leaders are anxious to put the ordeal behind them. But as 2025 comes to a close, it is indisputable that Pennsylvania needs to both confront serious climate issues and reckon with the scale of the challenges we face with respect to energy affordability and reliability.

We at the Pennsylvania Environmental Council (PEC) supported Pennsylvania’s entry into the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) program because we believed that it would help to lessen some of the Commonwealth’s energy challenges. These challenges include new, power-hungry data centers and a backlog of new electric generating projects waiting to connect to the regional grid, which remain primary drivers of rising electric bills. We face long-term fuel and operational costs, and foreign markets holding our exports to increasingly higher standards of sustainability. RGGI could have been a powerful tool to provide the means to help meet these challenges, and others we’ve only barely begun to consider. It also could have helped with the worsening funding crisis for public transit systems statewide, another priority left unaddressed in budget negotiations.

Failing to meet looming energy challenges puts Pennsylvania at risk of continually rising electricity costs and loss of jobs and economic opportunities to other states — particularly those tied to emerging technologies. As only one example, PJM’s own market monitor has indicated that existing ratepayers have already paid $16.6 billion in increased electricity prices for the 2026-27 capacity auction due to existing and forecast data center demand alone.

So, what now?

Realistically, the benefits of RGGI’s cap-and-invest structure won’t be realized with any one policy. But multiple legislative and regulatory proposals are on the table in Harrisburg that can help move the needle on energy affordability, reliability, and availability. It’s more important than ever that these measures advance with due urgency.

At the top of the list is PRESS, a long-overdue expansion of Pennsylvania’s antiquated Alternative Energy Portfolio Standards, which PEC has advocated for nearly two decades. PRESS will further diversify the mix of energy sources our power generation system relies on while also reducing carbon pollution. Other elements of the Governor’s Lightning package, including updating our state’s energy efficiency program, securing community energy, and improving the siting process for new generation build, are also essential. Add to this two good ideas that passed key House committee votes last month: one helping clear a path for deployment of next-generation nuclear power, and another providing tax credits to help manufacturers save money and cut emissions through energy-efficiency upgrades. Other proposals hold promise for creating storage capacity, modernizing transmission systems, exploring new energy technologies like advanced geothermal, and building the state’s energy workforce.

All of these goals are within reach in 2026. But given rising demands, costs, and emissions inherent in how we currently operate, business as usual won’t meet Pennsylvania’s energy challenges and maintain our place as an innovative energy powerhouse. Government must lead by providing the right policies and incentives to ensure that Pennsylvania thrives. A sound energy policy can check all of the boxes. Let’s build the technologies of the future here, get more electrons on the grid, reduce emissions, grow our workforce, and put investment into making our systems and products better. 2026 must be the year we do what it takes to secure a prosperous clean energy future.

Deployment of additional infrastructure builds on more conventional actions such as a site-opening push, proactive service visits, and attendants at some of our busiest sites, the company explains.",https://evchargingstations.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/20251220-G8mRc8fWcAEQdv4-1024x559.jpg,N,,2025-12-20 14:58:57.912423

Fewer inspections, weaker enforcement and less oversight: Deep cuts to state budgets and at the Environmental Protection Agency are preventing regulators from fully protecting the public from pollution, according to a report released today by the Environmental Integrity Project.

The financial crisis at these agencies is occurring amid the expansion of the fossil fuel, plastics and petrochemical industries, said EIP Executive Director Jen Duggan.

When states have fewer resources, Duggan said, “those protections, those rights that every American has under our environmental laws, are not being realized.”

President Trump’s budget proposal would decimate 2026 spending at the EPA by 55 percent, or $4.2 billion, according to the report. House Republicans are recommending cutting it by a quarter, while the Senate Appropriations Committee voted for a reduction of just 5 percent.

If enacted, these reductions would exacerbate the EPA’s financial plight. Over the last 15 years, the agency’s budget has been slashed by 40 percent, Duggan said, and its workforce by 18 percent. Since Trump began his second term, more than 3,000 EPA workers have retired or have been terminated as part of the administration’s gutting of the agency.

The upshot of these cuts is that states have to pick up the slack, which is central to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin’s vision for the agency. In March, on the day he announced “the biggest deregulatory action in history,” Zeldin said he intended to “give power back to the states.”

However, the Trump administration has proposed eliminating most EPA grants to the states, undercutting their agencies’ ability to wield that power.

Texas lawmakers have cut by a third the budget for the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality over the last decade, accounting for inflation, the EIP report says. The agency has also struggled to retain employees; 30 percent of its workforce has less than two years of experience, and half have less than five years.

Kathryn Guerra worked for nearly four years at the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, where she helped small businesses and local governments comply with regulations. Most recently, Guerra worked in the EPA Region 6 office overseeing environmental justice efforts, which the Trump administration eliminated this year.

She’s now the TCEQ campaign director for Public Citizen, a nonprofit advocacy group.

The funding cuts to TCEQ described in the report “render the agency largely ineffective,” Guerra said, “and cuts to the EPA will worsen that ineffectiveness.”

According to TCEQ’s biennial report to the Texas legislature, it takes an average of 351 days to process one enforcement case. The agency’s most recent enforcement report shows a backlog of 1,400 enforcement cases, Guerra said.

“Ultimately it means communities don’t get relief from the environmental harms those polluters are causing,” she said.

States with the deepest budget cuts to environmental agencies from 2010–2024, according to the report, are:

Mississippi—71 percent

South Dakota—61 percent

Alabama—49 percent

Texas—33 percent

Montana—32 percent

North Carolina is among the states whose budgets have contracted in the past 15 years. While the EIP report said the state Department of Environmental Quality’s budget had declined 32 percent from 2010-2014, an agency restructuring in 2015 makes quantifying the depth of the reductions difficult.

“These cuts have real impacts on the people of our state,” said Drew Ball, director of Southeast Campaigns for the Natural Resources Defense Council, on a press call about the report.

Ball also serves as a Buncombe County Commissioner in an area wrecked by Hurricane Helene in 2024.

“When a family in eastern North Carolina notices their tap water turning cloudy after a heavy rain, there are fewer staff who can investigate,” he went on. “There are fewer inspectors available to respond when hurricanes send flood waters through low lying areas, mixing industrial pollution, animal waste and storm water, the staff responsible for tracking and responding to those threats are being asked to do far more with far less.”

During the 2008 recession, North Carolina lawmakers cut DEQ’s budget, part of a statewide belt-tightening. However, the Republican-led legislature has not fully restored those reductions in more economically robust times and during an era of increased population growth.

From 2020 to 2024, census data show the state’s population has grown by more than 5 percent. But over the same period, when accounting for inflation, DEQ’s budget decreased.

In 2019, the DEQ budget was $97.4 million, according to state documents, equivalent to $123.7 million today.

The 2023 DEQ budget totalled $108.7 million, or $115.8 million in today’s money. That’s a 6 percent decrease compared with four years earlier.

Some of the agency’s functions rely on permitting fees. In at least one instance, a healthier environment has resulted in unexpected financial consequences. As state and federal regulations have made the air cleaner, Title V facilities, the largest air pollution sources, have decreased their emissions, according to a 2023 DEQ report to the legislature.

This has translated to a drop in “billable tons”—54 percent over a decade—that generate a portion of the agency’s revenue. Yet the state’s 300 Title V facilities still must be inspected and their permits renewed, even as the number of staff has decreased by 19 percent.

In 2024, the legislature increased the permit fee to help close the gap.

North Carolina had the largest staffing cuts at environmental agencies from 2010 to 2024, according to the report, though the same caveat related to the 2015 restructuring applies.

States with the next largest staffing cuts, 2010-2024, are:

Connecticut—26 percent

Arizona—25 percent

Louisiana—24 percent

Missouri and Kansas—20 percent

Adding to the budgetary crisis, it’s also been difficult for North Carolina DEQ to retain or hire employees. At its peak three years ago, the agency had vacancy rates that exceeded 20 percent. DEQ officials said at the time that agency wages, whose boundaries are set by the legislature, can’t compete with the private sector.

“Many families today live with waste in roadside ditches, wells that are too contaminated to drink from and constant fear about what the next storm will carry into their yards,” Ball said. “Yet the very agency responsible for protecting these families is facing a growing burden, with shrinking staff, shrinking budgets and shrinking political support, and now the federal government is proposing the deepest cuts to EPA in 40 years. That’s a recipe for disaster in states like ours.”",https://cdn.prod.dailykos.com/images/1442150/story_image/AP25140723348491.jpg?1749501039,N,,2025-12-20 15:59:18.412771

To offset those concerns, the company pledged to shield existing customers from the cost of the expansion but only through 2031.
“Large load” customers, such as data centers, will pay for the expansion through the rates they are charged, the company said, but there remains a risk that the data centers do not come.
So Georgia Power addressed that by signing a “stipulated agreement” to allocate costs based on the current revenue forecasts that assume the demand will be there.
“If you proceed,” she said, “you will absolutely not be decent to the tens of thousands of Georgia Power customers on fixed or low incomes.”","ATLANTA — State regulators granted Georgia Power the authority for an historic expansion of its capacity to generate electricity in a unanimous vote Friday.

The decision by the five elected members of the Public Service Commission, all Republicans, allows the privately-owned monopoly to build five gas-powered plants and supporting infrastructure while contracting for additional power from other suppliers.

Critics said the expansion, equivalent to five times the power output of the Hoover Dam, could cost up to $60 billion, saddling generations of Georgians with the bill.

The company asked for and got permission to add nearly 10 gigawatts of generating capacity, close to a 50% increase in its capacity. It said its forecasts showed voracious future demand from tech companies that will be building server warehouses to power the internet and artificial intelligence.

In a statement after the vote, Kim Greene, chairman, president, and CEO of Georgia Power, called the demand “projected unprecedented growth,” noting that the company had filed customer contracts with the commission this year for three gigawatts in new demand.

Critics contended that the forecast revenue, based on “trade secret” information that the public cannot see, was overly optimistic. If the demand does not materialize, they said, Georgia Power’s other customers would be left with the bill for the construction of that unneeded capacity.

To offset those concerns, the company pledged to shield existing customers from the cost of the expansion but only through 2031. Thereafter, the agreement allows for amendments to hit the brakes if demand does not materialize.

“Large load” customers, such as data centers, will pay for the expansion through the rates they are charged, the company said, but there remains a risk that the data centers do not come.

So Georgia Power addressed that by signing a “stipulated agreement” to allocate costs based on the current revenue forecasts that assume the demand will be there.

This “downward pressure” on rates will equal $8.50 a month for the typical residential customer, the company said.

Lawyers for opponents, including environmental organizations and renewable energy advocates, said there were undisclosed assumptions in Georgia Power’s calculations that they contended could create a countervailing “upward pressure” on residential bills.

They wanted the company to enter its calculations into the public record, so the commission could more easily hold it to account for its pledge in the future.

Lawyers for the Southern Environmental Law Center filed motions calling for the disclosure and for a 30-day delay on the vote.

“The point of this motion is not about whether it’s a good deal or a bad deal,” said Jennifer Whitfield, one of the lawyers. “It’s about … Georgia Power showing its work for the conclusions that are in the agreement so that we can enforce that agreement down the road.”

Her colleague, Bob Sherrier, added later: “We have a problem with the stipulation putting a number on the downward pressure but not a number on the upward pressure.”

Jason Shaw, chairman of the commission, denied the request, saying his agency already had all the necessary information from Georgia Power.

Then the commissioners voted for the expansion, with audience members shouting “shame,” “disgusting” and “sell out!”

Before the vote, members of the public got time to speak.

Some extolled the benefits of reliable power, saying big companies will not bring jobs to Georgia if the state cannot stay ahead of demand.

“It’s about being proactive rather than reacting too late,” said Susanne Reynolds, director of the Development Authority of Early County in southwest Georgia.

But most were furious about the expansion because of the potential cost for customers and the impact on the environment of burning more fossil fuel.

They also were unhappy with the timing of the vote, less than two weeks before January.

That is when two new commissioners, both Democrats, will take over the seats of the two Republicans they beat decisively in an election last month

Julie Jabaley said she would work hard to unseat the remaining three Republicans.

She was among the protesters escorted out of a similar hearing last week after they were told they had violated the commission’s rules on “decorum,” a word that Jabaley mocked.

“If you vote on this proposal today as is, you demonstrate an utter lack of respect for thousands of petitioners who have tried to decorously convince you that there’s a better way to fulfill your mission that consumers receive safe and reasonably priced services,” she said.

Jabaley said she wanted “clean, smart energy for the future” and was concerned about the cost of the expansion.

“If you proceed,” she said, “you will absolutely not be decent to the tens of thousands of Georgia Power customers on fixed or low incomes.”","https://www.augustachronicle.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/10/02/NAUG/86481029007-naug-data-center-opposition-0930202502-kg.JPG?crop=2787,1568,x0,y0&width=2787&height=1568&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-20 19:58:59.919346

The Standardising Permitting and Expediting Economic Development (SPEED) Act, formally designated as H.R.
The renewable energy sector's support for permitting reform reflects practical recognition that environmental review streamlining benefits all energy infrastructure development, regardless of technology type.
Energy sector companies should begin preparing for potential SPEED Act implementation while maintaining flexibility regarding timeline and scope uncertainties.
The SPEED Act passage in the House represents just the beginning of what could be a transformative period for American energy infrastructure development.","American energy infrastructure sits at a critical juncture where decades of regulatory complexity collide with unprecedented demand for domestic resource development. The intersection of environmental oversight, economic necessity, and national security considerations has created a permitting landscape that industry leaders characterise as fundamentally broken. Against this backdrop, federal lawmakers are attempting to recalibrate the balance between environmental protection and energy project development through comprehensive legislative reform targeting the foundational frameworks that govern major infrastructure decisions.

The current regulatory environment reflects layers of environmental review processes that evolved over more than five decades, creating what many stakeholders view as duplicative and time-intensive approval mechanisms. These systems, originally designed to ensure thorough environmental consideration, now face scrutiny for their role in delaying critical energy projects across multiple sectors. Furthermore, the growing consensus among diverse industry coalitions suggests that modernising these frameworks has become essential for maintaining America's competitive position in global energy markets while addressing domestic supply challenges.

Understanding Federal Permitting Reform: Why the SPEED Act Matters

What Is the SPEED Act and Its Core Objectives?

The Standardising Permitting and Expediting Economic Development (SPEED) Act, formally designated as H.R. 4776, represents a comprehensive legislative effort to restructure federal environmental review processes. According to Congress.gov's official bill summary, the legislation limits the scope of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) and modifies the environmental review of major federal actions under NEPA to generally limit the number of federal actions that trigger NEPA review and to expedite the review process.

The bill emerged through bipartisan collaboration between Representative Bruce Westerman (R-Arkansas), who serves as House Natural Resources Committee Chairman, and Representative Jared Golden (D-Maine). This cross-party sponsorship reflects the legislation's attempt to address concerns that transcend traditional political boundaries, particularly in regions where energy infrastructure development directly impacts local economies.

Core provisions of the SPEED Act focus on modernising NEPA review processes through several key mechanisms:

Reducing duplicative environmental assessments across federal agencies

Establishing more definitive timelines for project review completion

Limiting litigation opportunities that extend project approval cycles

Streamlining coordination between federal and state regulatory authorities

The American Petroleum Institute's President and CEO Mike Sommers characterised the legislation as a critical step toward modernising a federal permitting system, emphasising that by modernising NEPA and reducing duplicative reviews and litigation, this bill restores certainty and helps unlock the infrastructure needed to deliver affordable, reliable energy and meet growing demand.

How Does Current Federal Permitting Create Infrastructure Bottlenecks?

The existing federal permitting framework creates substantial operational challenges across multiple energy sectors through prolonged review cycles and regulatory uncertainty. For instance, industry representatives consistently identify these delays as primary obstacles to meeting domestic energy demand and maintaining competitive positioning in international markets, often requiring detailed mining permitting insights to navigate complex approval processes.

Current System Limitations:

Multi-agency coordination complexity requiring separate approvals from numerous federal departments

Overlapping review requirements between federal, state, and local jurisdictions

Extended litigation periods following initial approvals

Uncertain timeline expectations preventing effective project planning and capital allocation

Texas Independent Producers and Royalty Owners Association President Ed Longanecker emphasised that comprehensive permitting reform represents a strategic imperative for the country and industry. Without such reform, America's energy sector, particularly oil and natural gas, cannot operate at the pace or scale needed to meet domestic needs, support allies abroad, or ensure long-term affordability for consumers.

Independent Petroleum Association of America President and CEO Edith Naegele characterised the SPEED Act as a much-needed answer to years of independent oil and natural gas producers' concerns regarding energy infrastructure permitting. This perspective reflects widespread industry frustration with existing approval processes that many stakeholders view as outdated relative to current technological capabilities and economic realities.

National Ocean Industries Association President Erik Milito highlighted that permitting certainty remains essential to keeping investment, jobs, and energy production in the United States. He emphasised that a durable, effective permitting framework provides the foundation for the nation's economic strength, global competitiveness, and energy dominance.

The cumulative impact of these delays extends beyond individual project timelines to affect broader strategic planning across energy sectors. Companies must account for regulatory uncertainty in their capital deployment decisions, often leading to delayed investments or project relocations to jurisdictions with more predictable approval processes.

Legislative Journey and Political Dynamics

What Were the Voting Patterns in the House?

The SPEED Act passage in the House occurred on December 19, 2025, with a final vote tally of 221-196, demonstrating notable bipartisan support despite overall partisan divisions on environmental policy. The voting breakdown reveals interesting cross-party dynamics that suggest regional and economic factors influenced individual representatives' decisions beyond traditional party-line considerations.

Voting Breakdown Count Republicans in favour 210 Republicans against 1 Democrats in favour 11 Democrats against 195 Total Passage Margin 25 votes

The 11 Democratic supporters represent a significant bipartisan element in legislation that primarily aligns with Republican energy policy priorities. These crossover votes likely reflect constituents' economic interests in districts where energy infrastructure development provides substantial employment and tax revenue benefits.

The single Republican opposition vote suggests near-unanimous party support for permitting reform, indicating strong consensus within Republican caucus leadership regarding the legislation's strategic importance. This level of party unity often facilitates more effective advocacy during Senate consideration and potential conference committee negotiations.

Why Did This Bill Achieve Bipartisan Support Despite Political Divisions?

Several factors contributed to the SPEED Act's ability to attract Democratic support in a politically polarised environment. Regional economic considerations, national security implications, and practical infrastructure needs appear to have influenced representatives from districts with significant energy sector employment.

Key Factors Enabling Bipartisan Support:

Regional economic dependencies on energy infrastructure projects

National security framing emphasising domestic energy production capacity

Renewable energy sector benefits from streamlined permitting processes

Pragmatic recognition of infrastructure development necessities

American Exploration & Production Council CEO Anne Bradbury characterised the vote as a turning point to fix America's broken permitting system and lower energy costs for every American. She specifically credited Chairman Bruce Westerman and Representative Jared Golden's SPEED Act as a bipartisan breakthrough to responsibly streamline environmental reviews and end permitting lawfare that stifles all forms of energy development and drives up costs for American families.

Energy Workforce and Technology Council President Tim Tarpley reframed the discussion beyond economic considerations, stating that passing permitting reform represents not just an economic need, but a critical national security issue. This security-focused messaging likely resonated with representatives concerned about domestic energy independence and supply chain resilience, particularly given the strategic importance of critical minerals and energy security considerations.

The inclusion of renewable energy advocacy through organisations like Turn Forward, which focuses on American offshore wind power development, helped broaden the coalition supporting permitting reform. Hillary Bright, Turn Forward's Executive Director, emphasised that permitting delays remain one of the greatest obstacles to advancing U.S. energy projects essential to meeting unprecedented demand on the nation's electrical grid.

Representative Golden's participation as co-sponsor reflects Maine's interests in offshore wind development, where federal permitting delays significantly impact project timelines and economic benefits to coastal communities. This demonstrates how specific regional energy opportunities can create bipartisan incentives for regulatory reform.

Industry Impact Analysis Across Energy Sectors

How Will Oil and Gas Operations Benefit from NEPA Reforms?

Oil and gas sector stakeholders anticipate significant operational improvements from SPEED Act implementation, particularly regarding infrastructure development timelines and regulatory certainty. The current permitting environment creates substantial planning challenges for companies seeking to develop pipeline networks, processing facilities, and upstream production capacity.

Anticipated Oil and Gas Benefits:

Pipeline development acceleration through reduced inter-agency coordination delays

Drilling permit processing improvements enabling more responsive resource development

Infrastructure expansion opportunities in key production basins

Reduced regulatory compliance costs through streamlined approval processes

The American Petroleum Institute's support for the legislation reflects industry-wide recognition that current permitting processes significantly impact project economics and development timelines. By modernising NEPA and reducing duplicative reviews and litigation, the reforms could unlock infrastructure needed to deliver affordable, reliable energy and meet growing demand.

Texas Independent Producers and Royalty Owners Association's endorsement emphasises the strategic importance of permitting reform for maintaining America's energy sector competitiveness. The association represents nearly 3,000 members whose operations depend on efficient regulatory processes for project development and expansion activities.

Independent petroleum producers, represented by IPAA, face particular challenges from extended permitting processes due to their typically smaller operational scale and limited resources for navigating complex regulatory requirements. Streamlined approvals could enable these companies to respond more effectively to market opportunities and contribute to domestic production capacity.

What Does This Mean for Renewable Energy Development?

Renewable energy sectors stand to benefit substantially from SPEED Act provisions, despite some environmental groups' opposition to the legislation. The current federal permitting framework creates similar delays for renewable projects as for traditional energy infrastructure, often extending development timelines by multiple years.

Renewable Energy Sector Benefits:

Offshore wind project timeline acceleration through streamlined federal approvals

Solar and onshore wind permitting efficiency improvements

Grid interconnection approval acceleration enabling faster project completion

Transmission line development facilitation supporting renewable energy integration

Turn Forward's advocacy for the SPEED Act demonstrates renewable energy sector recognition that permitting delays represent fundamental obstacles to meeting America's growing electrical grid demands. Offshore wind projects, which require extensive federal coordination due to their location in federal waters, could experience particularly significant timeline improvements.

Hillary Bright emphasised that America faces skyrocketing energy demand and that offshore wind projects offer a proven way to provide utility-scale power to densely populated areas where resource diversity helps avoid grid disruptions and rising utility costs. The organisation advocates for bringing more viable, scalable American energy sources online through regulatory efficiency.

The renewable energy sector's support for permitting reform reflects practical recognition that environmental review streamlining benefits all energy infrastructure development, regardless of technology type. Solar, wind, and transmission projects currently face many of the same regulatory bottlenecks as traditional energy infrastructure.

How Could Mining and Critical Minerals Extraction Change?

Critical minerals extraction represents another sector where SPEED Act implementation could significantly impact domestic supply chain security and economic competitiveness. Current federal permitting processes for mining operations often extend development timelines well beyond those seen in other major mining jurisdictions globally.

Potential Mining Sector Impacts:

Domestic rare earth element project acceleration supporting technology supply chains

Lithium extraction permitting improvements enabling battery material production

Copper and base metals development streamlining supporting infrastructure construction

Strategic mineral security enhancement through domestic production capacity

The United States currently depends heavily on foreign sources for many critical minerals essential to renewable energy technologies, electric vehicles, and defence applications. Consequently, streamlined permitting processes could enable domestic projects to compete more effectively with international suppliers operating under different regulatory frameworks.

Mining projects typically require extensive environmental review due to their potential impacts on local ecosystems and water resources. However, SPEED Act provisions could reduce approval timelines while maintaining essential environmental safeguards through more efficient review processes, as demonstrated by evolving trends in the mining industry evolution.

Economic and Investment Implications

What Are the Projected Economic Benefits of Faster Permitting?

Economic analysis of permitting reform suggests substantial potential benefits across multiple sectors, though precise quantification depends on implementation details and industry response patterns. Accelerated project approval timelines could unlock significant capital investment that currently remains delayed due to regulatory uncertainty.

Projected Economic Impact Areas:

Job creation acceleration across energy infrastructure sectors

Infrastructure investment mobilisation through reduced regulatory risk

Regional economic development enhancement in energy-producing areas

Consumer energy cost reduction through increased domestic supply

The cumulative impact of faster permitting extends beyond individual projects to affect broader economic development patterns. Regions with significant energy resources could experience accelerated economic growth through more rapid project development and associated employment creation.

Investment capital currently held back due to permitting uncertainty represents a substantial potential economic catalyst. Private sector companies often delay major capital commitments until regulatory approval certainty increases, meaning permitting reform could trigger significant near-term investment deployment.

Regional Economic Multiplier Effects:

Direct employment in energy infrastructure construction and operation

Indirect economic benefits through local supplier networks and service providers

Induced economic activity from increased worker income and spending

Tax revenue enhancement for local and state governments

How Might This Affect Energy Infrastructure Investment Flows?

Investment patterns across energy infrastructure sectors could shift significantly following SPEED Act implementation, with potentially substantial implications for capital allocation and project development priorities. Reduced regulatory timelines and increased approval certainty typically encourage higher levels of private sector investment.

Investment Flow Considerations:

Private capital deployment acceleration in previously delayed projects

Public-private partnership opportunities expansion in transmission and renewable sectors

Foreign direct investment enhancement through improved regulatory predictability

Risk profile improvements attracting institutional investor participation

Energy infrastructure projects require substantial upfront capital investments with long-term payback periods, making regulatory uncertainty particularly challenging for project economics. In addition, streamlined permitting processes could improve project risk profiles sufficiently to attract additional institutional investment from pension funds, insurance companies, and other large-scale capital sources.

The transmission sector represents a particularly significant opportunity for investment acceleration, as grid modernisation and expansion require extensive federal coordination but offer substantial economic returns through improved system efficiency and renewable energy integration capabilities. Savvy investors recognise that comprehensive investment strategy insights are crucial when evaluating these emerging opportunities.

Senate Prospects and Implementation Challenges

What Are the Realistic Chances of Senate Passage?

The SPEED Act faces a more complex political environment in the Senate, where energy policy legislation typically requires broader bipartisan support for successful passage. Current Senate composition and historical voting patterns on energy infrastructure issues suggest the bill's prospects depend heavily on amendments and modifications during committee consideration.

Senate Consideration Factors:

Committee assignment and markup scheduling priorities

Key senator positioning on energy permitting reform

Amendment potential addressing environmental concerns

Timeline coordination with other legislative priorities

National Ocean Industries Association President Erik Milito emphasised that as the Senate takes up this legislation, Congress must work collaboratively to deliver the strongest possible permitting reform that provides real certainty, avoids unintended consequences, and supports investment across the full spectrum of America's energy economy.

The Senate's deliberative process typically involves more extensive stakeholder consultation and amendment consideration than House procedures. This could result in modifications addressing environmental groups' concerns while maintaining the legislation's core permitting reform objectives.

What Implementation Challenges Could Emerge?

Successful SPEED Act implementation would require substantial coordination across multiple federal agencies and adaptation of existing regulatory frameworks. The complexity of current environmental review processes suggests implementation challenges could emerge in several areas.

Potential Implementation Obstacles:

Federal agency resource allocation requirements for expedited reviews

State-federal coordination mechanisms development

Legal challenge management from opposition groups

Environmental compliance framework maintenance under accelerated timelines

Federal agencies currently managing NEPA reviews would need additional resources and modified procedures to implement accelerated approval processes while maintaining environmental protection standards. This could require significant training, system development, and organisational restructuring.

Interagency coordination represents another substantial implementation challenge, as many energy projects require approvals from multiple federal departments with different priorities and procedures. Streamlining these processes while maintaining appropriate oversight could prove technically and administratively complex.

Environmental and Community Considerations

How Do Environmental Groups View These Changes?

Environmental organisations have raised substantial concerns about SPEED Act provisions, arguing that accelerated permitting processes could compromise environmental protection and community consultation processes. Opposition groups worry that streamlined reviews might overlook important ecological and social impacts.

The Sierra Club, described as the most enduring and influential grassroots environmental organisation in the United States, has criticised the SPEED Act and coordinated opposition through a letter sent by more than 150 environmental and community groups to Congress opposing the legislation.

Environmental Group Concerns:

Environmental review thoroughness reduction under accelerated timelines

Community consultation process limitations

Cumulative impact assessment potential oversight

Long-term environmental monitoring framework adequacy

Opposition groups argue that current NEPA requirements serve essential functions in identifying and mitigating potential environmental impacts that might otherwise be overlooked in rapid development processes. They contend that thorough environmental review ultimately saves costs and prevents problems rather than creating unnecessary delays.

What Safeguards Remain Under the Reformed Framework?

Despite environmental groups' concerns, SPEED Act provisions maintain important environmental protection requirements while streamlining review processes. The legislation aims to improve efficiency rather than eliminate environmental consideration entirely.

Maintained Environmental Protections:

Environmental assessment requirements preservation with modified timelines

Scientific review standards continuation under expedited processes

Public participation opportunities maintenance in streamlined formats

Monitoring and compliance enforcement mechanisms retention

The challenge lies in balancing environmental protection thoroughness with development timeline efficiency. Successful implementation would require maintaining rigorous environmental standards while eliminating duplicative or unnecessarily prolonged review processes.

Strategic Scenarios for Energy Market Evolution

Scenario 1: Rapid Implementation and Industry Response

Under this scenario, SPEED Act implementation proceeds smoothly with minimal legal challenges, enabling rapid acceleration of energy infrastructure development across multiple sectors. Industry response could trigger significant near-term investment and project development activity.

Rapid Implementation Outcomes:

Project pipeline acceleration across oil, gas, and renewable sectors

Market competition intensification through increased development capacity

Regional energy hub emergence in areas with favourable resource and regulatory combinations

Supply chain localisation opportunities through domestic project expansion

This scenario could result in substantial economic benefits through job creation, increased energy production capacity, and enhanced supply chain resilience. However, it might also strain regulatory agency resources and create implementation challenges requiring careful management.

Scenario 2: Legal Challenges and Delayed Implementation

Alternative scenario development involves extensive legal challenges from environmental groups and other stakeholders, creating implementation delays and regulatory uncertainty that limit near-term benefits while prolonging current permitting challenges.

Delayed Implementation Impacts:

Court battle timeline extension affecting industry planning

Investment uncertainty continuation during legal proceedings

Alternative state-level approaches development by individual states

International competitiveness implications from continued delays

Extended legal challenges could undermine the legislation's intended benefits while creating additional uncertainty for industry planning and investment decisions. This scenario might prompt some companies to pursue alternative development strategies or consider international opportunities.

Scenario 3: Modified Senate Version and Compromise Framework

A middle-ground scenario involves Senate modifications addressing environmental concerns while maintaining core permitting reform objectives. This compromise approach might achieve broader bipartisan support while balancing development and environmental priorities.

Compromise Framework Elements:

Environmental safeguard enhancements addressing opposition concerns

Implementation timeline adjustments allowing gradual system adaptation

Stakeholder consultation expansion improving community engagement

Monitoring requirement strengthening ensuring environmental compliance

This scenario could provide the most durable long-term solution by building broader stakeholder consensus while achieving meaningful permitting improvements. However, compromise provisions might reduce some of the legislation's intended efficiency benefits.

Long-term Strategic Implications

How Could This Reshape America's Energy Landscape by 2030?

SPEED Act implementation could fundamentally alter America's energy development trajectory over the next decade, potentially accelerating domestic production capacity across multiple sectors while enhancing supply chain resilience and international competitiveness.

2030 Energy Landscape Projections:

Domestic energy production capacity substantial expansion across sectors

Energy independence enhancement through reduced import dependencies

Global energy market positioning strengthening through competitive advantages

Technology deployment acceleration enabling innovation and efficiency improvements

The cumulative impact of accelerated permitting could position the United States as a more dominant global energy supplier while reducing consumer costs through increased domestic production capacity. This transformation could affect international trade balances and geopolitical relationships significantly.

What Are the Broader Economic Competitiveness Considerations?

Beyond immediate energy sector impacts, SPEED Act implementation could enhance broader American economic competitiveness through reduced energy costs, improved supply chain reliability, and strengthened manufacturing capacity dependent on affordable energy inputs.

Competitiveness Enhancement Areas:

Manufacturing sector revival through competitive energy costs

Critical supply chain reshoring enabling domestic production capacity

Innovation ecosystem development supporting advanced energy technologies

International trade balance improvements through energy exports

Manufacturing industries that depend heavily on energy inputs could benefit substantially from increased domestic energy production and associated cost reductions. This could encourage reshoring of manufacturing operations previously relocated to countries with lower energy costs.

Key Takeaways and Next Steps

What Should Stakeholders Monitor in 2025?

The SPEED Act's journey through the Senate represents a critical phase requiring stakeholder attention to committee assignments, amendment proposals, and broader legislative scheduling priorities. Multiple factors will influence the bill's ultimate prospects and final form, particularly in light of potential developments from an executive order on mining permits that could complement these legislative efforts.

Critical Monitoring Priorities:

Senate committee scheduling and markup timeline development

Industry coalition building efforts supporting passage

Environmental group legal strategy development for potential challenges

State government positioning regarding federal permitting reforms

Hillary Bright emphasised that the Senate now has a critical opportunity to advance permitting reform and deliver the certainty needed to unlock investment and accelerate large-scale energy development. This perspective reflects widespread industry recognition that Senate action represents the legislation's most significant remaining hurdle.

How Can Businesses Prepare for Potential Changes?

Energy sector companies should begin preparing for potential SPEED Act implementation while maintaining flexibility regarding timeline and scope uncertainties. Strategic preparation could enable more effective response to regulatory changes when they occur.

Business Preparation Strategies:

Project pipeline optimisation for potential acceleration opportunities

Regulatory compliance framework updates anticipating new requirements

Stakeholder engagement plan modifications addressing streamlined processes

Investment timing considerations based on implementation scenarios

Companies with projects currently in permitting processes should evaluate potential benefits from SPEED Act provisions while maintaining compliance with existing requirements. This dual-track approach could position organisations to capitalise on regulatory improvements without compromising current approval progress.

The American energy infrastructure landscape stands at a potential turning point where decades of regulatory complexity may give way to more streamlined development processes. Success in navigating this transition will require careful attention to legislative developments, strategic preparation for multiple scenarios, and continued engagement with evolving regulatory frameworks. The ultimate impact will depend on implementation effectiveness, stakeholder adaptation, and the broader economic and political environment surrounding energy policy development. The SPEED Act passage in the House represents just the beginning of what could be a transformative period for American energy infrastructure development.

Miller,,,,,https://moparinsiders.com/ford-follows-rams-lead-pulls-the-plug-on-the-all-electric-lightning/,"Ford has effectively killed the all-electric F-150 Lightning as we know it and is pivoting to an extended-range electric vehicle (EREV) strategy for its next-generation electric pickup.

Instead of doubling down on a pure EV, Ford is rethinking its entire strategy.
Ford estimates the upcoming Lightning EREV will deliver more than 700 miles of total driving range.
Ford hasn’t released detailed specs yet for its Lightning EREV, nor has it confirmed a launch date.","For the better part of the last decade, Detroit has pushed hard toward fully electric pickup trucks. Some of that momentum is now slowing, and the market is speaking loudly. Earlier this year, Ram made headlines by backing away from a pure battery-electric Ram 1500 REV and instead putting its full weight behind the extended-range electric Ramcharger. At the time, critics questioned the move.

Now, those critics are getting their answer—straight from Dearborn.

Ford has effectively killed the all-electric F-150 Lightning as we know it and is pivoting to an extended-range electric vehicle (EREV) strategy for its next-generation electric pickup. In other words, Ford is following the same path Ram already chose.

The writing has been on the wall for a while. Sales of large, fully electric trucks have not met early expectations, especially when real-world towing, cold weather, and long-distance use come into play. Ford has already stopped producing the current F-150 Lightning, repurposing the Rouge Electric Vehicle Center to build gas-powered F-Series trucks. What was once described as a temporary shift is now permanent.

Instead of doubling down on a pure EV, Ford is rethinking its entire strategy.

The next-generation F-150 Lightning will no longer be a battery-only truck. When it returns, it will be built on an EREV architecture—an electric drivetrain backed by a gasoline engine that works strictly as a generator. The wheels are still driven by electric motors, but the onboard engine eliminates the biggest complaint EV truck owners have voiced: range anxiety.

Ford estimates the upcoming Lightning EREV will deliver more than 700 miles of total driving range. That figure alone explains why the company is willing to absorb a massive financial hit—roughly $19.5 billion—after already launching and developing the Lightning EV program.

This is where Ram’s earlier decision starts to look less controversial and more forward-thinking.

Stellantis initially planned to offer two electric Ram 1500 models: a full battery-electric REV and the extended-range Ramcharger. As the EV truck market softened, Ram delayed and eventually canceled the pure EV, choosing to focus exclusively on the EREV solution. That decision now appears aligned with where customer demand is actually headed.

Ford CEO Jim Farley summed up the reasoning bluntly, saying, “Rather than spend billions more on these large EVs that we had planned that have no path to profitability, we’re going to pour our investments into higher margin areas — more American-built trucks, more American-built vans, hybrids across our lineup, and even affordable EVs built in Kentucky. And we’re going to go into the energy storage business in the Midwest, make our country stronger,” Farley said to Fox News.

That statement signals a broader industry shift. It’s no longer EV-at-any-cost. It’s about building trucks that people can afford, use, and rely on—especially in America’s heartland, where towing, hauling, and long distances are part of everyday life.

Volkswagen’s Scout brand has also announced plans for extended-range electric trucks and SUVs, further reinforcing that EREV technology is becoming the new bridge between internal combustion and full electrification.

Meanwhile, Ram is preparing to bring its EREV truck to market first. The 2026 Ram 1500 REV—formerly known as the Ramcharger—is engineered to calm range anxiety without sacrificing performance. It pairs a liquid-cooled 92 kWh battery with a 3.6-liter Pentastar V6 that functions solely as a generator. Total system output checks in at 647 horsepower and 610 lb.-ft. of torque, good for a 0–60 mph run in about 4.5 seconds.

Ram is targeting up to 690 miles of total range, along with a towing capacity of up to 14,000 lbs and a payload rating of 2,625 lbs. It also supports bi-directional charging, allowing owners to power homes, job sites, or equipment directly from the truck.

Ford hasn’t released detailed specs yet for its Lightning EREV, nor has it confirmed a launch date. What it has confirmed is direction—and that direction mirrors Ram’s playbook almost step for step.

The pure electric half-ton pickup may not be dead forever, but for now, the market has spoken. Extended-range electric trucks are emerging as the most practical solution for American truck buyers. Ram got there first. Ford just admitted it was right.",https://moparinsiders.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/F-150-Lightning_Platinum_on-road_03-scaled.jpeg,N,,2025-12-20 13:59:06.665666

In Mexico, experts believe the country’s battery storage capacity could expand significantly in the coming years.

Enrique Garduño, the CEO of the energy equipment company Skysense, said that Mexico will likely experience “the storage boom in 2027, 2028, and 2029,” driven by regulatory updates, rapid renewable energy growth, and the maturation of storage technologies. Skysense currently runs almost 200 MWh of storage capacity and expects to roll out an additional 300 MWh by 2026. Garduño explained that “It’s a very open government that is genuinely listening to the private sector.” In addition, “We are buying, installing and selling storage systems at less than half the price of three or four years ago.”

Skysense has partnered with China’s BYD Energy Storage to expand its capacity, and BYD’s “MC Cube-T BESS” platform will power the technology. The firm’s North America Vice President of Sales, Oscar Su, stated, “Expanding into a high-potential region such as Latin America is a key step for us… We bring nearly 30 years of battery R&D and the world’s largest power battery production capacity.”

Meanwhile, there are high hopes for India’s battery storage sector, but more needs to be done to attract investment. The South Asian country has seen record-low bids to develop its battery storage systems, with a lack of economic viability as well as safety risks potentially deterring investors. India is aiming to double its renewable energy capacity to 500 GW by 2030, but without a rapid growth in its battery storage capacity, it will be unable to provide a reliable power supply without continuing to rely heavily on fossil fuels.

There has been a battery storage boom in certain parts of the world, as governments and energy companies invest in expanding capacity to support a green transition. However, some parts of the world are lagging, which could cause the shift away from fossil fuels to renewable alternatives to be slower than anticipated unless greater investment is made in the sector.

“That includes closing older, less-efficient power plants and building new renewable energy facilities and clean, efficient natural gas plants.
Some states, such as Minnesota, have adopted laws prohibiting the costs of stranded assets from data centers being passed onto ratepayers.
The bill attracted some Democratic cosponsors, but was opposed by the Wisconsin Utilities Association and did not get a hearing.","By some measures, the Pleasant Prairie Power Plant, once regarded locally as an “iconic industrial landmark,” had a good run.

Opened in 1980 near Lake Michigan in Kenosha County, it became Wisconsin’s largest generating plant, burning enough Wyoming coal, some 13,000 tons a day, to provide electricity for up to 1 million homes.

But over time, the plant became too expensive to operate. The owner, We Energies, shut it down after 38 years, in 2018.

We Energies customers, however, are still on the hook.

A portion of their monthly bills will continue to pay for Pleasant Prairie until 2039 — 21 years after the plant stopped producing electricity.

In fact, residential and business utility customers throughout Wisconsin owe nearly $1 billion on “stranded assets” — power plants like Pleasant Prairie that have been or will soon be shut down, a Wisconsin Watch investigation found.

That total will likely grow over the next five years with additional coal plants scheduled to cease operations.

Customers must pay not only for the debt taken on to build and upgrade the plants themselves, but also an essentially guaranteed rate of return for their utility company owners, long after the plants stop generating revenue themselves.

“We really have a hard time with utilities profiting off of dead power plants for decades,” said Todd Stuart, executive director of the Wisconsin Industrial Energy Group.

The $1 billion tab looms as Wisconsin utility companies aim to generate unprecedented amounts of electricity for at least seven major high-tech data centers that are proposed, approved or under construction. By one estimate, just two of the data centers, which are being built to support the growth of artificial intelligence, would use more electricity than all Wisconsin homes combined.

All of which raises an important question in Wisconsin, where electricity rates have exceeded the Midwest average for 20 years.

What happens to residents and other ratepayers if AI and data centers don’t pan out as planned, creating a new generation of stranded assets?

How much do Wisconsin ratepayers owe on stranded assets?

Of the five major investor-owned utilities operating in Wisconsin, two — We Energies and Wisconsin Public Service Corp. — have stranded assets on the books. Both companies are subsidiaries of Milwaukee-based WEC Energy Group.

As of December 2024, when the company released its most recent annual report, We Energies estimated a remaining value of more than $700 million across three power plants with recently retired units: Pleasant Prairie, Oak Creek and Presque Isle, a plant on Michigan’s Upper Peninsula.

Wisconsin Public Service Corp.’s December 2024 report listed roughly $30 million in remaining value on recently retired units at two power plants.

In total, utilities owned by WEC Energy Group will likely have over $1 billion in recently retired assets by the end of 2026.

The company also noted a remaining value of just under $250 million for its share of units at Columbia Generating Station slated to retire in 2029, alongside a remaining value of roughly $650 million for units at Oak Creek scheduled to retire next year.

Its customers will pay off that total, plus a rate of return, for years to come.

The company estimates that closing the Pleasant Prairie plant alone saved $2.5 billion, largely by avoiding future operating and maintenance costs and additional capital investments.

Both Wisconsin Power and Light and Madison Gas and Electric also own portions of the Columbia Energy Center, and Wisconsin Power and Light also operates a unit at the Edgewater Generating Station scheduled for retirement before the end of the decade. Neither company provided estimates of the values of those facilities at time of retirement. Andrew Stoddard, a spokesman for Alliant Energy, Wisconsin Power and Light’s parent company, argued against treating plants scheduled for retirement with value on the books as future stranded assets.

How stranded assets occurred: overcommitting to coal

In 1907, Wisconsin became one of the first states to regulate public utilities. The idea was that having competing companies installing separate gas or electric lines was inefficient, but giving companies regional monopolies would require regulation.

Utility companies get permission to build or expand power plants and to raise rates from the three-member state Public Service Commission. The commissioners, appointed by the governor, are charged with protecting ratepayers as well as utility company investors.

Stranded assets have occurred across the nation, partly because of the cost of complying with pollution control regulations. But another factor is that, while other utilities around the country moved to alternative sources of energy, Wisconsin utilities and, in turn, the PSC overbet on how long coal-fired plants would operate efficiently:

In the years before We Energies pulled the plug on Pleasant Prairie, the plant had mostly gone dark in spring and fall. Not only had coal become more expensive than natural gas and renewables, but energy consumption stayed flat. By 2016, two years before Pleasant Prairie’s closure, natural gas eclipsed coal for electricity generation nationally.

In 2011, We Energies invested nearly $1 billion into its coal-fired Oak Creek plant south of Milwaukee to keep it running for 30 more years. The plant, which began operating in 1965 and later became one of the largest in the country, is now scheduled to completely retire in 2026 — with $650 million on the books still owed. That will cost individual ratepayers nearly $30 per year for the next 17 years, according to RMI, a think tank specializing in clean energy policy. The majority of the debt tied to those units stems from “environmental controls we were required to install to meet federal and state rules,” WEC Energy Group spokesperson Brendan Conway said.

In 2013, to settle pollution violations, Alliant Energy announced an investment of more than $800 million in the Columbia Energy Center plant in Portage, north of Madison. But by 2021, Alliant announced plans to begin closing the plant, though now it is expected to operate until at least 2029.

Various factors encourage construction and upgrades of power plants.

Building a plant can create upwards of 1,000 construction jobs, popular with politicians. Moreover, the Public Service Commission, being a quasi-judicial body, is governed by precedent. For example, if the PSC determined it was prudent to allow construction of a utility plant, that finding would argue in favor of approving a later expansion of that plant.

The PSC allowed utility companies “to overbuild the system,” said Tom Content, executive director of the Wisconsin Citizens Utility Board, a nonprofit advocate for utility customers. “I think the mistake was that we allowed so much investment, and continuing to double down on coal when it was becoming less economic.”

Utilities “profit off of everything they build or acquire,” Stuart said, “and so there is a strong motivation to put steel in the ground and perhaps to even overbuild.”

Conway, the WEC Energy Group spokesperson, argued that the utilities’ plans to retire plants amount to a net positive for customers.

“We began our power generation reshaping plan about a decade ago,” he wrote in an email. “That includes closing older, less-efficient power plants and building new renewable energy facilities and clean, efficient natural gas plants. This plan reduces emissions and is expected to provide customers significant savings — hundreds of millions of dollars — over the life of the plan.”

Guaranteed profits add to ratepayer burden

The built-in profits that utility companies enjoy, typically 9.8%, add to the stranded assets tab.

When the Public Service Commission approves construction of a new power plant, it allows the utility company to levy electricity rates high enough to recover its investment plus the specified rate of return — even after a plant becomes a stranded asset.

“We give them this license to have a monopoly, but the challenge is there’s no incentive for them to do the least-cost option,” Content said. “So, in terms of building new plants, there’s an incentive to build more … and there’s incentive to build too much.”

When the Pleasant Prairie plant was shut down in 2018, the PSC ruled that ratepayers would continue to pay We Energies to cover the cost of the plant itself, plus the nearly 10% profit. The plant’s remaining value, initially pegged at nearly $1 billion, remained at roughly $500 million as of December 2024.

Eliminating profits on closed plants would save ratepayers $300 million on debt payments due to be made into the early 2040s, according to Content’s group.

New ‘stranded assets’ threat: data centers

As artificial intelligence pervades society, it’s hard to fathom how much more electricity will have to be generated to power all of the data centers under construction or being proposed in Wisconsin.

We Energies alone wants to add enough energy to power more than 2 million homes. That effort is largely to serve one Microsoft data center under construction in Mount Pleasant, between Milwaukee and Racine, and a data center approved north of Milwaukee in Port Washington to serve OpenAI and Oracle AI programs. Microsoft calls the Mount Pleasant facility “the world’s most powerful data center.”

Data centers are also proposed for Beaver Dam, Dane County, Janesville, Kenosha and Menomonie.

The energy demand raises the risk of more stranded assets, should the data centers turn out to be a bubble rather than boom.

“The great fear is, you build all these power plants and transmission lines and then one of these data centers only is there for a couple years, or isn’t as big as promised, and then everybody’s left holding the bag,” Stuart said.

In an October Marquette Law School poll, 55% of those surveyed said the costs of data centers outweigh the benefits. Environmental groups have called for a pause on all data center approvals. Democratic and Republican leaders are calling for data centers to pay their own way and not rely on utility ratepayers or taxpayers to pay for their electricity needs.

Opposition in one community led nearly 10,000 people to become members of the Stop the Menomonie Data Center group on Facebook. In Janesville, voters are trying to require referendums for data centers. In Port Washington, opposition to the data center there led to three arrests during a city council meeting.

Utilities are scheduled in early 2026 to request permission from the Public Service Commission to build new power plants or expand existing plants to accommodate data centers.

Some states, such as Minnesota, have adopted laws prohibiting the costs of stranded assets from data centers being passed onto ratepayers.

Wisconsin has no such laws.

Shifting cost burden to utility companies

Currently, ratepayers are on the hook for paying off the full debt of stranded assets — unless a financial tool called securitization reduces the burden on ratepayers.

Securitization is similar to refinancing a mortgage. With the state’s permission, utilities can convert a stranded asset — which isn’t typically a tradeable financial product — into a specialized bond.

Utility customers must still pay back the bond. But the interest rate on the bond is lower than the utility’s standard profit margin, meaning customers save money.

A 2024 National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners report noted that utilities’ shareholders may prefer a “status quo” scenario in which customers pay stranded asset debts and the standard rate of return. Persuading utilities to agree to securitization can require incentives from regulators or lawmakers, the report added.

In some states, utilities can securitize the remaining value of an entire power plant. Michigan utility Consumers Energy, for instance, securitized two coal generating units retired in 2023, saving its customers more than $120 million.

In Wisconsin, however, utilities can securitize only the cost of pollution control equipment on power plants — added to older coal plants during the Obama administration, when utilities opted to retrofit existing plants rather than switching to new power sources.

In 2023, two Republican state senators, Robert Cowles of Green Bay and Duey Stroebel of Saukville, introduced legislation to allow the Public Service Commission to order securitization and allow securitization to be used to refinance all debt on stranded assets. The bill attracted some Democratic cosponsors, but was opposed by the Wisconsin Utilities Association and did not get a hearing.

Democratic Gov. Tony Evers proposed additional securitization in his 2025-27 budget, but the Legislature’s Republican-controlled Joint Finance Committee later scrapped the provision.

Even Wisconsin’s narrow approach to securitization is optional, however, and most utilities have chosen not to use it.

We Energies was the first Wisconsin utility to do so, opting in 2020 to securitize the costs of pollution control equipment at the Pleasant Prairie plant. Wisconsin’s Public Service Commission approved the request, saving an estimated $40 million. “We will continue to explore that option in the future,” Conway said.

But the PSC expressed “disappointment” in 2024 when We Energies “was not willing to pursue securitization” to save customers $117.5 million on its soon-to-retire Oak Creek coal plant. The utility noted state law doesn’t require securitization.

Stuart said that if utilities won’t agree to more securitization, they should accept a lower profit rate once an asset becomes stranded.

“It would be nice to ease that burden,” he said. “Just to say, hey, consumers got to suck it up and deal with it, that doesn’t sound right. The issue of stranded assets, like cost overruns, is certainly ripe for investigation.”

Comprehensive planning required elsewhere — but not Wisconsin

Avoiding future stranded assets could require a level of planning impossible under Wisconsin’s current regulatory structure.

When the state’s utilities propose new power plants, PSC rules require the commission to consider each new plant alone, rather than in the context of other proposed new plants and the state’s future energy needs. Operating without what is known as an integrated resource plan, or IRP, opened the PSC to overbuilding and creating more stranded assets. IRPs are touted as an orderly way to plan for future energy needs.

“There’s no real comprehensive look in Wisconsin,” Stuart said. “We’re one of the few regulated states that really doesn’t have a comprehensive plan for our utilities.

”We’ve been doing some of these projects kind of piecemeal, without looking at the bigger picture.”

Structured planning tools like IRPs date back to the 1980s, when concerns about cost overruns, fuel price volatility and overbuilding prompted regulators to step in. Minnesota and Michigan require utilities to file IRPs, as do a majority of states nationwide.

Evers proposed IRPs in his 2025-27 state budget, but Republican lawmakers removed that provision because it was a nonfiscal policy issue.

Northern States Power Company, which operates in Wisconsin and four other Midwestern states, is required by both Michigan and Minnesota to develop IRPs. “Because of these rules, we create a multi-state IRP every few years,” said Chris Ouellette, a spokesperson for Xcel Energy, the utility’s parent company.

Madison Gas and Electric, which only operates in Wisconsin, argued that its current planning process is superior to the IRP requirements in neighboring states. “A formal IRP mandate would add process without improving outcomes,” spokesperson Steve Schultz said. “Wisconsin’s current framework allows us to move quickly, maintain industry-leading reliability and protect customer costs during a period of rapid change.”

How to influence decisions relating to stranded assets

The devil will be in the details on whether the Public Service Commission adopts strong policies to prevent the expected wave of new power plant capacity from becoming stranded assets, consumer advocates say.

The current members, all appointed by Evers, are: chairperson Summer Strand, Kristy Nieto and Marcus Hawkins.

The public can comment on pending cases before the PSC via its website, by mail or at a public hearing. The commission posts notices of its public hearings, which can be streamed via YouTube.

Among the upcoming hearings on requests by utilities to generate more electricity for data centers:

Feb. 12: We Energies’ request to service data centers in Mount Pleasant and Port Washington. We Energies says the fees it proposes, known as tariffs, will prevent costs from being shifted from the data centers to other customers. The “party” hearing is not for public comment, but for interaction between PSC staff and parties in the case, such as We Energies and public interest groups.

Feb. 26: Another party hearing for a case in which Alliant Energy also said its proposed tariffs won’t benefit the data center in Beaver Dam at the expense of other customers.

To keep abreast of case developments, the PSC offers email notifications for document filings and meetings of the commission.

The PSC would not provide an official to be interviewed for this article. It issued a statement noting that utilities can opt to do securitization to ease the financial burden on ratepayers, adding:

“Beyond that, the commission has a limited set of tools provided under state law to protect customers from costs that arise from early power plant retirements. It would be up to the state Legislature to make changes to state law that would provide the commission with additional tools.”

On Nov. 6, state Sen. Jodi Habush Sinykin, D-Whitefish Bay, and Rep. Angela Stroud, D-Ashland, announced wide-ranging data center legislation. One provision of their proposal aims to ensure that data centers don’t push electricity costs onto other ratepayers.

The project will help family farmers increase their incomes, strengthen their resilience to climate shocks, and access better infrastructure and rural services.

The operation includes US$50 million in financing from the World Bank, within a total project envelope of US$67.13 million when counterpart funding and beneficiary contributions are added. By boosting productivity, value addition, and market access for family farmers, the project is expected to support more and better jobs in rural areas, both on-farm and in associated activities such as processing, logistics, services, and rural infrastructure works.

“Once again, in partnership with the World Bank, our administration celebrates an important achievement for Paraíba’s family farmers with the approval of the second phase of the Sustainable Rural Development Program,” said João Azevêdo, Governor of Paraíba. “This new phase will expand access to water, reduce agroclimatic vulnerability, and strengthen market access, generating jobs and income while improving living conditions in rural communities. We are confident that this initiative will continue transforming lives and ensuring that families can remain and thrive in the countryside.”

“This project will help Paraíba’s family farmers access markets, adapt to a changing climate, and seize new economic opportunities in rural areas,” stated Cécile Fruman, World Bank Country Director for Brazil. “By investing in climate-smart production, rural connectivity, and stronger farmer organizations, the operation will support job creation, raise incomes, and improve living conditions for some of the state’s most vulnerable communities.”

The Project Development Objective is to improve market access and enhance the climate resilience of selected family farmer beneficiaries in Paraíba. The project forms Phase 4 of the World Bank’s Transforming Brazil’s Agrifood System Multiphase Programmatic Approach (MPA) and is fully aligned with Paraíba’s 2024-2027 Multi-Year Plan and the state’s strategies for sustainable rural development, water security, and climate resilience.

Key Areas of Support

The project will operate through four mutually reinforcing components:

Strengthening Sustainable Production for Family Farmers

This component will finance climate-smart investments for family farmers and their organizations, including improved production systems, water management, renewable energy (such as solar and biodigesters), digital connectivity, and environmental recovery. By supporting productive alliances, processing facilities, storage, and access to markets, it will help farmers increase the value of their products and generate jobs along rural value chains.

Improving Rural Accessibility and Reducing Climate Vulnerability

Targeted investments in rural access, such as small road improvements and water crossings, will help connect isolated communities to markets, schools, health services, and job opportunities year-round. These works will be prioritized in areas most exposed to floods and erosion, helping to protect livelihoods and reduce climate-related disruptions to economic activity.

Technical Assistance and Capacity Building for Beneficiaries

The project will provide technical assistance, training, and exchange visits to help family farmers adopt climate-resilient technologies, improve business management, and strengthen producer organizations. Special emphasis will be placed on women, youth, Indigenous Peoples, and Quilombola communities, helping them access markets, finance, and better employment and leadership opportunities in rural organizations.

Project Management, Monitoring and Evaluation, and Institutional Strengthening

Support to the Project Management Unit and partner institutions will ensure effective implementation, monitoring of results, and learning. The project will also strengthen state and local capacities for rural development, environmental management, and inclusive stakeholder engagement.

The project will be implemented by Projeto Cooperar, an autonomous entity linked to the State Secretariat for Family Farming and the Development of the Semi-Arid Region (SEAFDS), in close coordination with sectoral agencies. Over its six-year implementation period, the operation is expected to benefit family farmers and rural communities across most of Paraíba’s municipalities, with a strong focus on poor and extremely poor households, women-headed families, youth, and Traditional Peoples and Communities.

By combining climate-smart agriculture, improved rural connectivity, and stronger institutions, the Paraíba Sustainable Rural Development Project – Phase II will help unlock rural economic potential, support job creation, and build resilience in one of Brazil’s most climate-vulnerable regions.

The world has been consumed by the need to decarbonize the energy industry, as it produces the vast majority of emissions that have devastated the environment. Germany has announced that the Boldecker Land wind repowering project is moving ahead following Enova Value being selected to lead the project. The repowering of the project will add approximately 68 MW to the national grid.

The revival of the Boldevker Wind Farm is well and truly underway

Germany has selected Enova to repower the Boldecker Wind farm with 68 MW of new wind turbines. The project will rely on the astonishing wind turbine manufacturing expertise of the Nordex Group, which has become the cornerstone of the international wind power market. The plan is to replace the ten Vestas V80 machines with ten of Nordex’s state-of-the-art N163 turbines across the municipalities of Barwedel and Jembke in the Gifhorn district of Lower Saxony.

Once the repowering project is complete, the Boldecker Wind Farm will generate enough electricity to power up to 43,000 German households. Enova acquired the rights to develop the site when it purchased the existing site from a private equity fund in 2024, and has been working alongside developer Altus to repower the site with the efficient Nordex wind turbines.

Construction on the Boldecker site is set to kick off in Q2 of 2026, with a full-scale commissioning targeted for 2027. Notably, the project was granted approval under Germany’s Federal Immission Control Act only nine months after the plans were submitted, exemplifying Germany’s efficiency when it comes to approving relevant renewable energy projects.

“(This milestone reflects) excellent cooperation – especially with our partner Altus, with whom we started repowering planning immediately after purchasing the wind farm, and the municipalities.” – Fabian Tews, lead project management at Enova

Enova is building its repowering portfolio in Germany through several other projects

Enova was selected to repower the Boldecker site, no doubt due to the success of the nearby 15.3MW Jembke wind farm. The project was recently connected to the national grid and provides the basis for more repowering projects in Germany for Enova. The company has also been selected to repower the Neuferchau wind farm in Saxony-Anhalt.

The site located in Altmarkkreis Salzwedel will see the existing eight NEG Micon 1000 machines, which were installed over 20 years ago in 2001, being replaced by five Vestas V172 turbines. The new turbines will increase electricity generation significantly, producing approximately five times more power than the current fleet of turbines.

Germany’s proclivity for the wind power sector has become evident in recent years

Germany has become the go-to destination for the wind energy market as the nation boasts one of the largest wind power portfolios anywhere in the world. The 21 MW Heinsberg-Boverath wind project in North Rhine–Westphalia has been advancing thanks to the new onshore turbines that the site will feature once completed. The embrace of the renewable energy sector is seen as a byproduct of the need to decarbonize the international energy market over the coming years.

The future of Germany’s energy market will be powered by wind energy

Enova has become a major player in the German energy market and boasts an impressive wind energy portfolio equating to 900MW of wind capacity, and it is not done yet. The firm plans to invest a further two billion euros in wind energy projects over the next two years. Astonishing advancements in wind power technology have shaken up the market, and the expectations are that Germany, along with several other European nations, will continue to foster a welcoming environment for the international energy companies with wind energy plans.",https://energiesmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/78.jpg,N,,2025-12-20 17:58:51.735447

U.S. Rep. John B. Larson, D-1, a House Social Security Subcommittee ranking member, said he and Tax Subcommittee Ranking Member Mike Thompson, Calif.-4, and Ways and Means Committee Ranking Member Richard E. Neal, MA-1, introduced the American Affordability Act of 2025.

Larson said the measure includes the Neighborhood Homes Investment Act and Revitalizing Downtowns and Main Streets Act, as the goal is to “expand affordable housing options,” and his Hydrogen Production and Investment Tax Credit Act “to spur the development of clean energy.”

“Americans across the country are getting squeezed by high costs everywhere they look, from energy bills to health care premiums, groceries, and rent,” said Larson, in a statement. “Trump’s cost-raising tariffs, cancellation of clean energy projects, and devastating health care cuts have only made it more difficult for families to make ends meet. While President Trump calls affordability a ‘hoax’ and pushes tax breaks for his billionaire friends, my Democratic colleagues and I are coming together with a real plan that takes on this cost-of-living crisis and cuts taxes for working families, not the wealthy.”

A message seeking comment was sent to the White House.

Larson is facing a primary as other Democrats seek the congressional seat he holds.

CT plans to spend millions from emergency fund. Why some of it might bring a fight.

Thompson said he see that families “are doing everything right” and are “still falling behind as costs keep rising.“

“The American Affordability Act is about real relief for families: affordable housing, lower energy bills, more affordable childcare and healthcare, and bigger paychecks,” Thompson said. “This bill delivers targeted tax relief and smart investments that help families make ends meet and restores the promise that hard work should be enough to get ahead in our country.”

Neal said, President Trump “projects and dismisses affordability fears as a ‘hoax,’” but “Democrats have been and always will be at the front of the fight to lower costs for everyday workers and families.

“Tax Ranking Member Mike Thompson knows that whether it’s tackling the housing crisis, making childcare more affordable, or lowering health and energy costs, we have so much work to do to ease the minds of the American people and foster opportunity. The American Affordability Act is a blueprint for the next step in our fight for what we are united to deliver: lower costs and easier, better lives,” Neal said.

The American Affordability Act seeks, per the lawmakers, to:

Expand Access to Affordable Housing: “Creates the first-ever monthly Renter Tax Credit for individuals and families paying more than 30% of their income on rent and creates a First-Time Homebuyer Tax Credit to help low- and middle-income earners; creates a new tax credit to bridge the gap between the cost of building or repairing a home and the home’s value once it is built, powering the development of 500,000 affordable, single-family homes over the next ten years

Incentivizes the conversion of vacant office spaces and other commercial properties into new housing, reserving at least 20% of new units for low-income residents.”

CT kicks in $6 million to clean up ex-UConn campus for massive redevelopment

Also, it aims to increase “the homeowner capital gains tax exemption to encourage more home sales and reduce the cost to buy a home, doubling the threshold to $500,000 for single filers and $1 million for joint filers.”

Lower Energy Costs: “Creates a new 30% tax credit for long-range electric transmission to lower the cost of grid modernization projects, taking steps to prevent mass power outages and lower ratepayer bills; restores tax credits for homeowners to install home energy efficiency upgrades, solar panels, geothermal, and other cost-reducing power sources; spurs the development of American-made clean energy by providing a tax credit to companies that reduce carbon emissions by producing “green” and “blue” hydrogen and fuel cells, [and] authorizes tax credits to purchase new and used electric vehicles and electric bikes.”

Worried about health insurance costs? There may be cheaper options — but with trade-offs

Stop Healthcare Price Hikes: “Permanently extends expiring Affordable Care Act tax credits, protecting 112,000 Connecticut residents from sky-high premium hikes; prevents insurance providers from dropping vaccine coverage due to [new] restrictions, including coverage for MMR, COVID-19 and Hepatitis B shots.”

Cuts Taxes for Families and Workers: “Restores the expanded Child Tax Credit for working parents, providing monthly payments of $300 for each child over the age of six and $360 for each child under the age of six; extends the Earned Income Tax Credit for adults without children and expands eligibility to cover working young adults; permanently extends tax cuts for tipped workers, and expands “no tax on tips” to include automatic gratuities; and expands the $250 teacher expense tax deduction to include early childhood educators.

CT families file discrimination complaints against hospitals over halt to trans care

Make Childcare More Affordable: “Increases the maximum dependent care Flexible Spending Account (FSA) contribution from $7,500 to $10,000, automatically adjusting the contribution limit for inflation; creates a new $5,000 refundable tax credit to cover startup costs needed to open family childcare centers; makes the adoption tax credit fully refundable, opening the door for more low-income families to pursue adoption; and creates a new tax credit to support working family caregivers.”

New student loan rule could dissuade people from advanced nursing degrees

Battery storage ensures that grids powered by less reliable energy sources, such as wind and solar power, can continue to deliver a stable supply of clean energy through the day and night.

The battery storage boom of recent years has been driven largely by the falling costs of lithium-ion batteries, which have made it possible for utilities worldwide to invest in more batteries. The cost of batteries has fallen by around 90 percent in the last 15 years, as commercial production has expanded. China is currently the world’s biggest battery producer, but several other regions are developing their manufacturing capacity, such as Europe, India, and the United States.

Energy storage additions worldwide are expected to break another record this year, driven by China and the U.S. Global annual energy storage deployment (excluding pumped hydropower plants) is expected to reach 92 GW in 2025, which is 23 percent higher than in 2024. China will contribute more than 50 percent of this capacity increase, while the U.S. will account for around 14 percent. The U.S. contribution of energy storage is impressive, given the difficult year faced by the wind and solar energy industries under the Trump administration. BloombergNEF expects cumulative energy storage capacity in 2035 to reach 2 terawatts, at eight times higher than the level in 2025.

In the United States, battery expansion has been met with mixed success. It is still difficult to convince utilities in certain areas of the country to invest in battery storage. Meanwhile, policymakers are often lukewarm about the technology due to safety concerns. Some local governments have even banned big batteries over safety fears. For example, compared to the speed of renewable energy expansion, the pace at which batteries are being rolled out in the Southeast remains slow.

However, in California, which previously asked residents to reduce their power usage during times of peak demand, battery storage capacity has risen by roughly 30 times since 2018, contributing to greater grid stability. California, Texas, and Arizona alone account for around 80 percent of all U.S. battery storage capacity. Now, across the U.S., storage capacity outnumbers gas power in the queues for future grid additions by a factor of 6.5, according to data compiled by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.

Several U.S. energy companies that have invested in battery power have been developing their capacity for several years, betting on the future demand in various regions. The storage developer Eolian “began developing projects around major metro areas in the western U.S. starting in 2016 and putting the queue positions in that then became operational in 2025,” the firm’s CEO, Aaron Zubaty, said. This includes the 200-MW coastal battery site at a substation in Portland, Oregon. Moves like this have helped the United States to achieve its 35 GW of battery storage by 2025 goal, despite widespread scepticism.

In addition to the United States, battery storage capacity is expanding in various other markets, as governments better understand the benefits of boosting renewable energy reliability. In Mexico, experts believe the country’s battery storage capacity could expand significantly in the coming years.

Enrique Garduño, the CEO of the energy equipment company Skysense, said that Mexico will likely experience “the storage boom in 2027, 2028, and 2029,” driven by regulatory updates, rapid renewable energy growth, and the maturation of storage technologies. Skysense currently runs almost 200 MWh of storage capacity and expects to roll out an additional 300 MWh by 2026. Garduño explained that “It’s a very open government that is genuinely listening to the private sector.” In addition, “We are buying, installing and selling storage systems at less than half the price of three or four years ago.”

Skysense has partnered with China’s BYD Energy Storage to expand its capacity, and BYD’s “MC Cube-T BESS” platform will power the technology. The firm’s North America Vice President of Sales, Oscar Su, stated, “Expanding into a high-potential region such as Latin America is a key step for us… We bring nearly 30 years of battery R&D and the world’s largest power battery production capacity.”

Meanwhile, there are high hopes for India’s battery storage sector, but more needs to be done to attract investment. The South Asian country has seen record-low bids to develop its battery storage systems, with a lack of economic viability as well as safety risks potentially deterring investors. India is aiming to double its renewable energy capacity to 500 GW by 2030, but without a rapid growth in its battery storage capacity, it will be unable to provide a reliable power supply without continuing to rely heavily on fossil fuels.

There has been a battery storage boom in certain parts of the world, as governments and energy companies invest in expanding capacity to support a green transition. However, some parts of the world are lagging, which could cause the shift away from fossil fuels to renewable alternatives to be slower than anticipated unless greater investment is made in the sector.

For a movement so often framed by loss—and confronting a particularly difficult moment—conservation is relearning how to talk about itself. This shift may signal something deeper than messaging: a recalibration of what persuades people to care, to fund, and to act, especially as the world edges toward 2030 amid ecological strain, political volatility, and thinning public trust.

A few months ago, I put out an invitation to the conservation sector: share how you are navigating this moment, which many have described as a period of crisis. That invitation resurfaced recently when Crystal DiMiceli referenced it during a fireside chat with me at the Emerging Wildlife Conservation Leaders’ 20th anniversary event in Washington, D.C.

DiMiceli asked what lessons are emerging so far. One of the most consistent responses has centered on communication: “Less crisis, more agency.”

Not because the crisis has abated, but because alarm on its own no longer mobilizes as reliably as it once did. If anything, it exhausts. Years of grim headlines have revealed an uncomfortable truth: when people are offered only catastrophe, many disengage. They stop reading, stop caring, and, in some cases, stop believing that anything meaningful can still be done.

What seems to be gaining ground instead is a focus on success—often partial, sometimes fragile, but demonstrable. Not triumphalism, but optimism grounded in evidence. Conservation framed as something people actively do, rather than something that merely happens to nature.

This reframing has another effect: it broadens the constituency. When conservation is presented solely as the protection of pristine places or distant species, it can feel remote, even exclusionary. When it is tied to livelihoods, rights, health, and local resilience, it becomes more immediate and more widely owned.

What makes conservation efforts take root and scale

That shift necessarily includes Indigenous peoples and local communities, long treated by mainstream conservation as stakeholders and only belatedly recognized as rights-holders and decision-makers. Initiatives that scale tend to share a simple, if demanding, feature: genuine local leadership. Not consultation after the fact, but ownership from the outset. Programs designed externally may pilot well for a time; they are far less likely to be sustained long-term or adapted elsewhere. Those rooted in place often spread precisely because they are not generic.

Scale, in this sense, is not synonymous with size. It more often emerges from accumulation: many small successes building momentum over time. The idea sounds modest, but it reflects how change actually spreads. Adaptation depends less on grand design than on transparency, data, narrative clarity, and continuous learning. Successful initiatives can point to visible benefits—for example, more fish on the reef, steadier incomes, or safer water—and explain how those outcomes were achieved. They show their work: documenting evidence, acknowledging failures, and describing what was adjusted along the way. That openness builds credibility locally and makes the work easier for outsiders, including funders, partners, and peers, to understand and adapt.

The importance of diversified funding has surfaced repeatedly as well. Conservation efforts tethered to a single donor, funding stream, or specific political moment tend to be brittle. Initiatives supported by a mix of philanthropy, public finance, community enterprise, and earned income are more likely to absorb shocks. In an increasingly volatile funding environment, that diversity functions less as a luxury than as a necessary form of resilience.

The next five years will test whether the sector can meaningfully internalize these lessons. Integrating people and nature is no longer rhetorical garnish; it increasingly shapes whether conservation efforts are perceived as legitimate or extractive. Rebuilding trust through transparency may, in some contexts, matter as much as the number of hectares protected. Narratives are beginning to shift toward agency, though doing so responsibly requires resisting the temptation to overstate what is possible. Technology, deployed with care, can help by lowering monitoring costs, improving access to data, and linking local efforts to wider audiences. Rights and environmental justice will shape outcomes whether or not they are acknowledged. Treating them as secondary concerns is not a neutral stance; it carries consequences that are often both predictable and expensive.

When human well-being and conservation align

One model that illustrates how these threads can come together is Health in Harmony’s “health for forests” approach in Borneo. Rather than asking communities to stop logging because forests matter globally—an argument common in external conservation narratives and one that can feel abstract—the organization begins with a more proximate question: What do you need? Frequently, the answer is access to affordable, reliable health care.

Health in Harmony responds by providing tiered health services, sometimes at no cost, in indirect exchange for verifiable conservation actions such as monitoring forest boundaries or restoring degraded land. The exchange sets clear expectations, but the deeper dynamic is relational rather than transactional. By working from community-identified needs, this approach clarifies how human well-being and forest health reinforce one another. Conservation actions that benefit the forest also support the social and economic stability that communities prioritize. That alignment—rather than the exchange mechanism alone—is what makes the model durable, especially as the sector works toward a target to conserve and restore 30 percent of the planet by 2030.

What journalism reveals about agency and accountability

In this context, the parallels with journalism are hard to miss. Journalism’s core role remains remarkably consistent: to check abuses of power, inform the public, and expand what people consider possible. The conditions under which that work is carried out, however, have grown more demanding. Disinformation spreads faster than corrections. Resources are shrinking across much of the media landscape. Civic space is narrowing in many of the places where environmental stakes are highest.

Still, journalism remains a public good that underpins nearly every other intervention, in conservation and beyond. Without credible information, policies misfire, markets distort, and communities are sidelined. Accountability begins with facts that can be trusted. So, often, does hope.

At Mongabay, our response has been to move closer to the ground: establishing autonomous regional bureaus, expanding multilingual reporting, and deepening partnerships with local journalists. We have tried to pair investigative reporting with solutions coverage, on the premise that exposing wrongdoing matters but so does documenting what works. Not as advocacy, and certainly not as cheerleading, but as evidence. Tracking how information is used—who it reaches, how it circulates, and what it influences—adds another layer of accountability.

This thinking sits behind a phrase that can sound suspect until unpacked: optimism is a strategy. It is not blind positivity. It is deliberate: a form of realism that recognizes despair as paralyzing and treats hope, when grounded in evidence, as a catalyst for action. Hope untethered from facts quickly curdles. But when anchored in proof, it sustains effort. Jane Goodall long articulated this idea, often describing her role as that of a messenger of hope.

There is no shortage of examples. Mountain gorillas have recovered against the odds. Species like the black-footed ferret, kākāpō, and saiga antelope have returned where sustained conservation effort has been possible. Entire island ecosystems have rebounded following the removal of invasive species. Forest loss has slowed in places once written off entirely. These stories are not just inspiring; they are instructional. They offer concrete lessons about what made recovery possible and how similar conditions might be adapted elsewhere.

Telling these stories has become a more intentional part of journalism’s contribution. I was told more than once that Mongabay was among the most depressing sites on the internet, chronicling species loss, forest destruction, and the rising toll of environmental defenders killed for their work. The description stung because it was not entirely wrong. We made a conscious decision to expand our solutions reporting—not to dilute the gravity of the crisis, but to pair it with verified accounts of progress. Not ignoring what is broken, but insisting on documenting what is being repaired and how.

That effort has taken shape through series on Indigenous-led conservation, conservation technology, agroecology and regenerative landscapes, and women at the forefront of community conservation, among others.

This evolution has coincided with another trend: news avoidance. Research from the Reuters Institute suggests that about 40 percent of people actively tune out the news. The reasons vary, but two categories of reporting consistently retain their attention: solutions-focused stories and positive news. That finding loops back to the same insight emerging in conservation conversations: agency matters, even for reader engagement.

Narrative, in the end, is not incidental. Facts alone rarely move people. Stories do. The challenge is to tell stories that are honest about the scale of the crisis while remaining faithful to evidence about what works. If people conclude that nothing can be done, they will not try. If they see that effort yields results, even incremental ones, they are more likely to stay or become engaged. Optimism, in that sense, is an antidote to paralysis.

What sustains my optimism

What sustains my own optimism? Mostly evidence. People doing extraordinary things with modest resources. Recovery demonstrated rather than promised. And a level of awareness we simply didn’t have a decade ago. Thanks to satellite monitoring, bioacoustic sensors, community-generated data, and tools that turn raw information into something visible and undeniable, we can now see environmental change in near real time. Ignorance is no longer a plausible excuse—not because people should have known better, but because the world is now measured and monitored in ways that make the trends unmistakable and clarify what actually works. We can see, for example, where territorial rights reduce deforestation, how local stewardship improves biodiversity, and why Indigenous- and community-led governance is essential for durable outcomes. This transparency is widening the constituency for conservation. As governments, businesses, and new sectors gain clearer insight into how ecosystems function—and how their own well-being depends on them—the case for protecting nature grows stronger. This shift is visible in policies linking ecosystems to human health, the surge of interest in nature-based solutions, and the expansion of forest protection beyond NGOs and forestry agencies into finance, agriculture, consumer-goods companies, and more. And then there is time spent in nature itself, a reminder of both what is at stake and what still endures.

That understanding, and the optimism it makes possible, is also why I have been writing more tributes to those we have lost: people who quietly carried conservation forward, often without recognition or institutional backing. Their passing is a loss, but the purpose of remembering them is not elegy alone. It is to show what one person can do and to leave readers not only saddened, but asking a simple, generative question: what might I carry forward?

Hope, grounded in evidence, is not a mood. It is a method. In conservation, as elsewhere, it is increasingly clear that lasting change depends on it.

Instead, the most prominent American voice in Belém was that of the California governor, Gavin Newsom.

During the five days he spent in Brazil, Newsom described Donald Trump as an “invasive species” and condemned his rollback of policies aimed at reducing emissions and expanding renewable energy. Newsom, long considered a presidential hopeful, argued that, as the US retreated, California would step up in its place as a “stable, reliable” climate leader and partner.

Among the talking points he used to demonstrate California’s leadership was its progress on renewable energy – and the battery capacity needed to store that power.

“We’re running the fourth-largest economy in the world [on] 67%, two thirds, clean energy on nine out of 10 days in 2025,” Newsom said. “Outside of China, there’s only one other jurisdiction in the world – California – that has as much battery storage implemented.”

The Golden state has transformed how it powers its main electrical grid in recent years, setting ambitious targets to create an emission-free grid by 2045 and investing heavily in solar, wind and battery storage. And as the federal government abandons climate initiatives, California seems poised to take on an increasingly important global role.

The state appears to have much to celebrate. Since 2019, the state has added 30,800 megawatts of clean energy and battery storage. And while natural gas still remains the top energy source in the state, that’s on the decline: California saw its largest-ever year-to-year drop in natural gas production this year.

Meanwhile, solar and batteries, which allow energy to be stored for later use, providing an alternative to gas, are stepping up to replace it, said Mark Jacobson, a Stanford professor and renewable energy expert: “This is a remarkable shift.”

‘A leader in the clean-energy space’

When touting his achievements as governor, Newsom has frequently pointed to California’s grid. State lawmakers in 2018 passed a bill requiring California to generate 60% of its electricity from renewable and zero-carbon sources by 2030 and 100% by 2045.

So far, California appears to be on track, Jacobson said. Clean energy accounted for 67% of retail electricity sales in 2023, according to the most recently available data. For the first time, clean energy – which the state recognizes renewables such as as solar, wind, small hydro, geothermal, and biomass, as well as large hydroelectric and nuclear – provided 100% of power to the state’s main grid almost every day for at least some of the day in 2025.

Renewables are booming worldwide and are expected to grow more quickly than any major energy source over the next 10 years with more projects in the next five years than in the last 40, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).

California is no exception and is in the midst of what the state’s energy commission (CEC) has described as the “biggest transformation of its power grid in a century”. The state is seeing new solar and battery storage projects in “record numbers” and is expected to soon completely eliminate coal from its power supply, according to the CEC.

Key to this growth has been the expansion of battery storage, a crucial tool to retain the energy produced from renewable sources. In 2019, California had 771 megawatts – by October of this year, it had almost 17,000. The state has 2.5 times more battery storage available than it did in 2022.

The batteries have helped the state avoid rolling blackouts and allowed the California Independent System Operator (Caiso), the non-profit that manages the flow of electricity on the state’s main grid, to store solar energy when there is an excess during the day.

“Then we can use that stored energy and release it in the evening hours when the sun is going down,” said Mark Rothleder, Caiso’s senior vice-president and chief operating officer. “Having a mix of resources that are capable of producing when needed is an important addition as we try to make this transition to renewable resources.”

But, he said, solar and wind are intermittent sources, meaning they can only be generated when there is sun or wind and the state’s main grid continues to rely on gas resources that can be utilized as needed.

Natural gas was the single largest resource for electricity production in 2024, but natural gas generation fell by 8% that year, in part because of the growing role of solar and wind power and enhanced battery storage, according to the CEC.

Nuclear power too plays a role – in 2024, it accounted for nearly 10% of the state’s total electricity generation – although not without controversy. California has been a center of anti-nuclear activism for decades, but supporters argue it could be a crucial tool to provide reliable power as the state transitions from fossil fuels.

While natural gas may be on the decline, it’s far from obsolete – and is relied on as a critical backup during times of peak energy usage. California has nearly 200 natural gas plants that provide roughly a third of the state’s electricity generation, said Julia Dowell, a senior campaign organizer with the Sierra Club.

“California is seen as a leader in the clean-energy space,” Dowell said. “But we’re really struggling to figure out how we meet demand in those evening hours when we’re seeing the most electricity demand, and that’s historically when we’ve relied on gas plants.”

A 2025 report from Regenerate California, which Dowell helped author, found that batteries are a less expensive and more reliable alternative to gas plants, and reduce toxic air pollution.

“They can directly compete with gas plants, and they can provide even more benefits because of their ability to ramp up so quickly,” said Heena Singh, with the California Environmental Justice Alliance and a report author. “That’s something that is important in California, where we have all these heatwaves and natural disasters.”

Fending off the Trump administration

California has long been a frequent target of Trump’s White House – and strife has only intensified during his second term.

With Trump back in power, the federal government has been focused on expanding fossil fuels and putting a damper on seemingly any effort to reduce emissions. The White House has proposed offshore lease sales along California’s coast. The president blocked California’s first-in-the-nation rule banning the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2030, and his EPA terminated a $7bn program to bring solar energy to low-income communities.

The administration cancelled $679m in funding for offshore wind developments across the US – California was expected to see about $427m for a project to build the first offshore wind terminal on the west coast. Months earlier, California and nearly 20 other states successfully sued after the federal government moved to pause offshore wind development.

More lawsuits are expected. The state attorney general’s office has established an office dedicated to pushing back against the president’s agenda.

Republicans and the Trump administration have also sought to blame the transition to renewable energy for high utility bills – California has some of the most expensive in the nation. But experts attribute those costs to power companies passing the costs of wildfires to customers.

Despite these pressures, California’s energy transition is well under way – and unlikely to reverse course.

“You’re going to see California fiercely litigating every single effort of the federal government to undo the fight against climate change and the fight against clean energy,” said Noah Perch-Ahern, an environmental attorney. “I think that’s going to continue for years.”

Meanwhile, advocates and experts hope to see California continue to expand clean energy with more rooftop solar projects that can reduce demand on the grid, and ultimately phase out gas plants.

“We’re just really hoping that people start to recognize that we don’t need these gas plants,” said Maia Leroy, an author of the Regenerate report, adding that there are significant costs to keeping them running even when the state isn’t using them for power. “It’s time to shut them down. It’s an expensive insurance policy.”

She’s hopeful California will continue to move ahead despite the federal obstacles.

“We made it through the first Trump administration. California survived, and we never once went back on any of our clean-energy goals. And so I don’t foresee that being an issue again this term,” she said.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a52e0ac7a3e03ca88697f8b319f8afbb6758a41c/0_0_3326_2662/master/3326.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c173087b932f3d6945853459afbe6063",N,,2025-12-20 10:59:23.995073

There are 27,000 known brownfields, or sites contaminated with pollutants, dotting Michigan. Many of them are locations where factories once stood.

About half are what the state calls “orphan sites,” meaning there’s no responsible party that owns the land and would otherwise have to clean up the pollutants, said Phil Roos, the director of the Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy.

“Sometimes people don’t even want to touch it if they don’t know the nature of the contamination or can’t address it,” Roos said.

That’s why the state is funding restoration projects, offering developers grants of up to $2 million, he said.

The grants cover assessing what the contaminants are, the best ways of removing them and often helping with the first stage of clean up, Roos said.

“Because we have a lot of these sites around the state, we need to de-risk it by providing some funding that will allow whoever’s developing the site to raise capital to do the development, knowing that it’s safe and they don’t have to address those issues any further,” he said.

The grants stem from the state budget for RenewMI which allocates $77 million. RenewMI is the department’s environmental remediation program.

When brownfields are cleaned up, they can be revitalized and turned into new housing developments, parks, commercial establishments or new industrialization.

The Lugnuts Stadium in Lansing, home to a minor league professional baseball team, is on a former brownfield, Roos said.

Since 2019, the state has been funding brownfield cleanup. The department has done 474 redevelopment projects in 50 communities, leading to $184 million in incentives and creating over 20,000 jobs, he said.

Those projects included the Grayling Northern Market and the Grayling Sawmill in 2018. The Grayling Northern Market used to be a planing mill and lumber yard, while the sawmill was a hotel, saloon and stores.

There have been four brownfield clean-up projects since 2020 in Traverse City. The most recent project in 2025 is Grandview Vision.

The site used to be an ice cream factory, and an antique store is on the property next door, according to Environment, Great Lakes and Energy’s website.

Cadillac has also seen four brownfield projects, including one in 2025 to clean up a former dry cleaners, grocery store and retail buildings.

In the past year, there has been an influx of housing developments built on cleaned-up brownfields. Roos said Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has made those projects a priority because of the state’s housing shortage.

“We can, in many cases, make it so there’s no threat to public safety and turn them into beautiful places to live,” he said.

However, not every brownfield site is equal, said Mike Witkowski, the director of environmental and regulatory policy at the Michigan Manufacturers Association.

Some “legacy sites” like abandoned gas stations and factories have contaminated an area to the point where the amount of money needed to clean it for residential development is unrealistic, he said.

There are different standards that dictate what brownfield sites can be used for while helping to prevent human exposure to harmful chemical pollutants, he said.

Those especially contaminated sites can still be cleaned up to meet standards for things like new industrial development.

“If you can come through and say, ‘All right, let’s turn this into a parking lot or another industrial setting and keep it at those standards’ – that’s really not only the best way to handle those contaminants, but it’s also the most economically sound for the state and private investment,” Witkowski said.

He said the number of existing brownfields makes it impossible for the state to clean all of them, meaning private developers cleaning up sites is all the more important.

“One of the best things we can do is have a robust and really well-functioning brownfield redevelopment program that allows these new private investment dollars to come in and say, ‘Hey, we want to build here on this site and not only are we going to provide jobs, but we’re also going to help clean up the the contaminants there and make this space usable property again,’” Witkowski said.

The Michigan Manufacturing Association opposes a bill currently in the Michigan Senate that would add additional clean-up standards, and extend liability for developers, saying it would likely discourage private investment into brownfields, he said.

“It really complicates it in a problematic way, which we feel is going to lead to less cleanups and less investment in our industrial sites and really more expansion into green space developments where there’s never been a development or any industry before,” Witkowski said.

He said the current brownfield program as it stands has been sufficiently vetted by the state and environmental engineers. It’s helped the economy grow across the state and has been successfully cleaning up contaminated sites.

“To try and bring that in a little bit or make change is going to hurt the trajectory of our environmental cleanups and economic growth,” Witkowski said.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7b3499a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/611x321+14+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F73%2F86%2F1c7acc524413a55593fb648f78ec%2Fdetroitriverwalk.jpg,N,,2025-12-20 12:58:58.171226

He talks to George Morahan about the evolution of DockChain and how the company plans to expand to meet demand across the world

Four years ago, Hugh Sheehy and his business partner John Goodbody were approached by University College Dublin (UCD) about developing DockChain, a technology patented by the university that can extend a single electric vehicle charger to multiple cars at low cost.

The technology was invented at UCD by Professor Robert Shorten and his team, who subsequently moved to Imperial College London where Shorten heads the Dyson School of Design Engineering.

At the time, Sheehy and Goodbody were working on another EV business for the British market. But they felt there was greater global potential in commercialising DockChain and co-founded Go Eve to deliver on the technology’s promise.

“It’s not often you get a chance to do something that’s potentially good for the planet and where you can make a little bit of money at the same time,” Sheehy says of his initial thoughts on DockChain, adding that he saw a “big opportunity” in the idea.

DockChain was conceived for home usage to allow people to extend their slower alternating current (AC) chargers, but Sheehy and Goodbody turned their focus to ‘behind-the-fence’ fleet operators, workplaces and local authorities — organisations with a greater need for multiple EV chargers.

The pair first had to confirm if the intellectual property covered faster, more powerful direct current (DC) chargers and if the idea worked as well with DC charging.

“If those two things were true, that was where we felt the market was for the next several years,” Sheehy says over a KitKat at the NovaUCD café.

After establishing Go Eve, Sheehy and Goodbody canvassed the industry to test interest in the idea and tried to build a viable product that could be built at a reasonable cost.

They built the first “crude” prototype with a grant from the UK’s Department for Transport. The software it used was similarly homemade.

Sheehy was assisted by Ammar Malik and Pietro Ferraro, who are now part of Go Eve’s engineering team.

The company raised £3.5 million stg in 2023, which they used to expand their software and hardware teams, buy components and build new versions of the product, pay legal and business costs and attend trade shows around the world to drum up interest.

Go Eve now has a core staff of 10 and around 14-16 full-time equivalents.

In August, DockChain received UL 2202 certification, the North American standard for safety and performance.

It is now in use at “a handful of locations” in the US and EMEA, including SAP’s Citywest offices and the Detroit headquarters of Stellantis, the parent group of Chrysler, Citroën and Opel among other car brands.

The business model is relatively simple — selling DockChain hardware and monthly software subscriptions — but how does the technology work? Well, it uses ‘daisy chain’ architecture to connect charging outlets, or “docks” as Sheehy calls them, at multiple parking spots with a single third-party EV charger.

DockChain uses an open-source charge management system from SAP known as an open charge point protocol (OCPP) to manage all the docks, recognise when cars are connected and authorise the charger to turn on and off.

Go Eve’s cloud software sits over the top, managing the OCPP, handling sequencing and other functionality.

In theory, DockChain can be integrated with any EV charger. Go Eve has agreed deals with several makers including Taiwan’s Zerova, although the firm is in the process of completing compatibility testing with other major manufacturers.

Two cars can charge simultaneously. At the SAP site in Citywest, the DockChain has 10 ten parking spaces — five on the left of the central charging terminal and five on the right.

Employees will arrive at the office, park their cars and plug them into DockChain.

The charger might be in use when they pull up, but their car will charge when it reaches the front of the queue and they’ll get a message on their phone when it’s done.

“Typically you’ll have a car charging, a space empty, a car charged, a car queued, another car queued and the system will just rattle through and charge them all in sequence,” Sheehy says.

In terms of output, a 150kw EV charger will by default share power equally between the two vehicles being charged. But there are variables such as battery size and space capacity that affect the current received by each vehicle.

Recalling the reactions of people in the EV charging industry when he showed the performance numbers for the DockChain at SAP, Sheehy says “they look at us a little bit like ‘that’s not possible.

You can’t charge that many cars with that power. You’d have to have military organisation to make that work.’”

Kilkenny native Sheehy is described on the Go Eve website as “a former oilman who saw the light”. Indeed, after training as a mechanical engineer, he worked as a developmental engineer at Shell for nearly a decade.

Daniel Plainview he is not though. Sheehy quit the industry in the late 1990s and completed an MBA at the prestigious INSEAD business school in France, later moving to Barcelona to work as a consultant.

Sheehy and his young family would settle in Dublin when he joined Google during the global financial crisis.

He went on to hold senior leadership positions with BNP Paribas, ESB and Morgan McKinley prior to starting Go Eve.

He’s not cagey by any means, and he’ll talk about DockChain at length. But when asked about the company’s projections for the coming years, Sheehy elides numbers, chiefly because he thinks his confidence in the product is off-putting.

With that said, Sheehy expects DockChain to become “omnipresent” in the US over the next five to seven years as the country reaches its EV tipping point.

“All startups do this, so it can sound a bit [crazy], but it’s the hockey-stick effect. As we get a couple of marquee customers, the pull from the other side will come,” he predicts.

“At the moment, people have it in their heads that there’s two ways of charging fleets, AC or DC and that’s it… but as we get some marquee customers, that’s going to change to AC, DC and DockChain as well. We will see a big ramp up.”

Having achieved the UL certification, Go Eve is now raising $3.5m to develop its commercial and marketing capabilities and add staff in sales and engineering.

The business is intentionally structured in such a way that it does not require much capital to fill larger orders — manufacturing has been outsourced to third parties in Hertfordshire and Michigan, while installation is handled by local partners.

If an organisation wanted to install DockChain at 1,000 locations over the next 18 months, Sheehy says Go Eve could raise additional capital to expand production, and he anticipates many such orders soon.

He recently spoke to a potential customer in the US who was thinking about installing DockChain at 30 sites in one state as a first step.

Another prospective client apologised to him for having only 480 car dealerships.

“Are there 480 dealerships in Ireland?” Sheehy wondered.",https://businessplus.ie/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/go-eve-LI.jpg,N,,2025-12-20 14:58:53.693768

The Sessions The three sessions followed a similar format, although, as detailed below, the session held in North Dakota differed somewhat.
Other than the opening remarks provided by the Agencies, the purpose of the sessions was for the Agencies to receive verbal comments on the Proposed Rule.
The North Dakota session was organized and presented differently from the others.
Responding to these regional conditions is one of the many issues that are worth tracking as the Proposed Rule goes through the regulatory process.","As part of their proposed rule (Proposed Rule) to revise the regulatory definition of “waters of the United States” (WOTUS), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) (collectively, Agencies) hosted three public comment sessions in which they received verbal comments from those in attendance. Two of the sessions were held in person with virtual attendance options – Bismarck, North Dakota on December 12, 2025, and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on December 15 – while the third session, on December 16, was fully virtual. EPA’s website contains additional details on the sessions, including draft agendas that list individuals who pre-registered to speak.

Background

As Nossaman previously detailed here, the Agencies are seeking to revise the definition of WOTUS and, thereby, what features would or would not be regulated under the Clean Water Act (CWA). Because of the significant regulatory burden associated with being subject to CWA jurisdiction and permitting, the definition of WOTUS has been frequently litigated. The U.S. Supreme Court has weighed in on four separate occasions, and the Agencies have revised the definition four times in roughly a decade.

The Proposed Rule generally focuses on limiting federal jurisdiction through narrowing what qualifies as a WOTUS. More information on the rulemaking can be found here.

The Sessions

The three sessions followed a similar format, although, as detailed below, the session held in North Dakota differed somewhat. Representatives from the Agencies opened each session by explaining the need for the Proposed Rule. The Agencies stated there were three objectives served by the Proposed Rule: fully implementing the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in Sackett v. Environmental Protection Agency, 598 U.S. 651 (2023); cutting red tape to reduce costs; and protecting water quality by striking the right balance between state and federal authority. They also highlighted that they were seeking clarity, certainty and durability while requesting information on regional differences and tools to implement any final rule.

Each session lasted between 3 and 3.5 hours. Other than the opening remarks provided by the Agencies, the purpose of the sessions was for the Agencies to receive verbal comments on the Proposed Rule. As a result, the Agencies did not answer any questions from those in attendance. The sessions were recorded for internal use, although the Agencies plan to post transcripts to their respective websites.

The North Dakota session was organized and presented differently from the others. The first half of this session (i.e., pre-break) was hosted by U.S. Senator Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) rather than by the Agencies. Senator Cramer, Senator John Hoeven (R-N.D.) and North Dakota Governor Kelly Armstrong all voiced support for the Proposed Rule and opposition to the existing framework. The commenters during this part of the session included local government officials and business leaders, all of whom voiced their support for the Proposed Rule. It was also unique because no list of commenters was provided. The second half of this session set the stage for the following sessions, as it was led by the Agencies, included a list of pre-registered speakers (both online and in-person) that was provided to the observers and provided an opportunity for other commenters after that.

The Pittsburgh session included the least participation of the three. Like the North Dakota session, it included a mix of online and in-person commenters, providing mixed views on the proposed rule.

The fully remote session was the most well attended, again providing mixed views on the proposed rule.

The Comments

Across the three sessions, there were roughly 75-100 commenters. The comments were split nearly 50-50, with a slight edge over all of the sessions in commenters opposed to the Proposed Rule. However, the North Dakota and Pittsburgh sessions included more supportive comments whereas the remote-only session included more opposition comments. Many commenters requested the comment deadline be extended given the importance of the rule and the various holidays that fall within the comment period.

The following list summarizes the most common points made by commenters and is not intended to be exhaustive:

Comments in support

Common sense rule that can be instituted without the need for experts or lawyers and reduces uncertainty

Consistent with Sackett and other WOTUS precedent

Cuts red tape and lowers costs

Returns jurisdiction back to states, tribes and landowners, all of whom know their land better than bureaucrats

This rule is durable and should stop the back-and-forth of the past decade over WOTUS

Supporters often advocated for a strengthening of the Proposed Rule, listing the need for more clarity on significant terms such as continuous surface connection, relatively permanent and wet season. They also advocated for more clarity/a strengthening of essentially every exception that is listed, with ditches receiving the most attention. Supporters also advocated for tools and other guidance to assist with implementation.

Comments in opposition

Ignores the science on these issues, in particular the impact of wetlands, ditches and other now-excluded areas that impact traditional navigable waters

Features like intermittent streams and ephemeral streams have a substantial impact on navigable waters

Shifts costs away from those responsible onto the public

Especially the case with the loss of protection for wetlands, which provide flood control and other services that protect citizens

Contrary to the intent of the Clean Water Act, which has overwhelming support in public polling

Polls show that people want more protection, not less

Bad for public health

Does not protect tribal rights

A giveaway to polluters/developers/is political in nature

Next Steps

Written comments can be submitted until January 5, 2026, on www.regulations.gov; commenters must mention Docket ID EPA-HQ-OW-2025-0322.

Given the number of commenters on both sides of the Proposed Rule requesting changes to it, it seems likely that the final rule could differ in some meaningful ways from the proposal. One area that the Agencies discussed was ensuring that the Proposed Rule properly reflected local conditions; they expressed a desire to ensure that the definitions and guidelines in the rule were clear enough to easily implement while also being crafted in a way to take into account regional differences in watershed conditions. For example, the commenters from North Dakota were supportive of the fact that prairie potholes did not qualify as WOTUS (although some wanted that more explicitly stated in any final rule) while one from Alaska discussed that this rule did not align with physical watershed conditions in Alaska. Responding to these regional conditions is one of the many issues that are worth tracking as the Proposed Rule goes through the regulatory process.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15042_2153.jpg,N,,2025-12-20 15:59:08.483660

From a rich history and culture, to magnificent art, exquisite food, and wine; all are iconic designs screaming “la dolce vita!” Now we have more reason to love Italy, as an Italian company has introduced colored solar panels into our existence, with colors including red, green, and even orange. One cannot help but be overjoyed over the fact that aesthetic appeal is being integrated into renewable technologies, and now, it’s coming to America!

Integrating aesthetic appeal into renewable technologies

In our modern world, traditional solar panels have slowly but surely become the norm in renewable energy production. However, that does not mean that everyone has become quite accustomed to them, particularly how they look. For most, the traditional solar panel is a headache, because:

They ruin scenic views (visual pollution)

They require too much land

They cannot be installed on all building types

They do not look visually pleasing on most buildings

Fortunately, the world is filled with several innovative minds who come up with pioneering solutions. An Italian company designed high-performance photovoltaic panels, which were initially available in all-black and could be easily installed on exposed roofs and even building facades. Now, the company has taken its popular designs one step further by introducing colored solar panels, integrating aesthetic appeal into renewable technologies.

Colored solar panels are arriving in America

This Italian company is none other than FuturaSun, located in the heart of Veneto. FuturaSun revolutionised the photovoltaic industry with its building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV), and what’s more, these revolutionary designs are arriving in America. According to a Solar Business Hub report, FuturaSun already has an annual production capacity of 1 GW through its plants in Taizhou/China.

With so many architects, designers, and engineers shifting their focus to more aesthetically pleasing designs, the colored solar panels are bound to add to America’s innovative renewable energy technologies. The company decided to release colored SILK® Pro panels, which are derived from monocrystalline half-cut multi-busbar cell technology.

A selection of colors to choose from

According to the company’s website, there is a selection of solar panel colors to choose from in addition to the all-black, which include:

SILK® Nova Silver

SILK® Nova Green Duetto

SILK® Pro Orange

SILK® Nova Orange

SILK® Nova Orange Duetto

SILK® Nova Red

To broaden customers’ design choices, they can now also choose the color of the solar panel’s frame, which is available in black, aluminium, or any other color on request. The silver panel’s modules range between 280 Wp and 295 Wp. The orange modules range between 240 Wp and 255 Wp, and the red modules range between 230 Wp and 245 Wp.

Additional benefits of the colored solar panels

Consists of two independent sections to increase power consumption in partial shading

Produces high output even in high temperatures

Well-suited for traditional buildings

Useful for renovations on roofs with tiles and/or brick tiles

Can be used to flank historic architecture and modern architecture

Can be installed on pitched roofs

Can be installed on facades

Enhances design options

15-year product warranty

25-year performance warranty

American homeowners and businessowners thus have something extremely exciting to look forward to, as FuturaSun’s color and pro lines are arriving in the country. Please note that the price of these panels is highly variable and will depend on the project’s location, system components, project size, and the local panel distributor. You can get a more accurate price by contacting a local distributor, which can be found on FuturaSun’s website. As buildings become unique, colorful power-producing machines, it seems people can also become power generators with clothing cut from solar cloth.

Porsche AG unveiled an electric version of its popular Cayenne sport utility vehicle, one of the models developed under an ambitious EV push that the luxury-car maker has since scrapped.

With a starting price of €105,200 ($121,760), the Cayenne Electric will be able to charge wirelessly and provide almost 400 miles of range, beating the longest-range Tesla Model Y offered in Europe.

The car’s debut in November came at an awkward time for Porsche. The German manufacturer is pivoting back to combustion-engine and hybrid models following weak demand for luxury EVs including its Taycan. Porsche reported its first quarterly loss as a listed company last month, and has cut its guidance four times this year in a slump that’s also weighed on parent Volkswagen AG. The poor performance saw the stock drop out of Germany’s benchmark DAX index.

As part of its EV pullback, Porsche shelved a new electric SUV range positioned above the Cayenne and delayed other battery-powered models. The automaker, which has also been hit by weak sales in China and US tariffs, has overhauled its top management and is trying to push through more cost cuts.

Porsche expects an improvement from 2026, when former McLaren Automotive Ltd. boss Michael Leiters takes over from Oliver Blume as chief executive officer. His knack for hybrids may help the company as it retools its portfolio.

In the meantime, Porsche is looking to the new Cayenne to bolster EV sales. Introduced more than two decades ago, the combustion-engine model has consistently ranked among Porsche’s top-selling vehicles and helped the company expand from a sports-car brand into a broader luxury nameplate.

Its new electric sibling is decked out with in-car gadgets including a head-up display and a voice assistant powered by artificial intelligence. It’s the first Porsche that can charge its battery by parking over an inductive floor plate.

A pricier Turbo version, starting at €165,500, delivers the equivalent of up to 1,156 horsepower and can reach 100 kilometers per hour in 2.5 seconds. That’s on a par with Ferrari NV’s Elettrica electric supercar and makes it the most powerful production Porsche ever, the company said.

With 40 stalls and a mixture of 150-kW and 400-kW chargers, it’s one of the largest stations in Illinois. There are CCS1 and NACS connectors available for maximum compatibility.

Additionally, the hub includes a covered canopy and free Wi-Fi. The site benefits from the adjacent BP-branded gas station, which has a convenience store, coffee shop, and restaurants nearby.

For BP Pulse, providing EV charging at major airports like ORD is a strategy. The network has already deployed EV charging hubs at the Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), near San Francisco International Airport (SFO), near Boston Logan Airport (BOS), near Houston’s Hobby Airport, and Fort Lauderdale (FLL) International Airport. Sites like these are dual-purpose — for ride-hail drivers and local EV drivers.

Sujay Sharma, CEO of bp pulse Americas, said:

“Opening our sixth major airport hub is a significant milestone in our commitment to expanding our EV charging network across the United States. By strategically placing our hubs in high-demand locations like airports, we’re making it easier for drivers to access the fast and reliable charging they need. Locating this hub next to a bp retail site also means EV drivers can benefit from the convenient amenities already offered to customers today.”

Large EV charging hubs are expensive to install. BP Pulse’s latest charging hub at Chicago’s ORD was funded partially through a $500,000 rebate from ComEd (through its Make Ready Rebate program) and partially through a $320,000 grant from the Illinois EPA’s Driving a Cleaner Illinois Program (one of over 300 EV charging projects, with total funding of $50 million).

According to the Alternative Fuels Data Center (AFDC), the BP Pulse network has approximately 70 locations and more than 500 DC fast-charging stalls.

The network’s map shows that the charging sites are located in major metropolitan areas rather than along highways. We assume BP Pulse considers these locations to be the most beneficial / profitable.

But before we get to that, what does the new edition of Greenhouse Gas Emissions Index look like?
Isn’t climate pollution a racial justice issue since communities of color and marginalized groups disproportionately feel the effects of corporate pollution?
Indeed, isn’t it most likely to expect an increase in corporate greenhouse gas pollution in the years ahead?
So we might see efforts to curtail greenhouse gas emissions even in the face of the current administration’s hostility to greenhouse gas regulation.","Since 2010, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has required large industrial facilities to report their greenhouse gas emissions. The data, which the EPA’s Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program has been collecting since 2011, is essential in efforts to reduce emissions and provides vital information to the public about climate pollution from the largest U.S. polluters. However, the Trump EPA has proposed to put an end to greenhouse gas reporting by major polluters. This move is consistent with the Trump administration’s intent to make climate denial an official U.S. policy and restricts the public from the right to know. Subsequently, it will deprive communities from having access to a critical tool for holding pollutants accountable.

Researchers at the Political Economy Research Institute (PERI) at the University of Massachusetts Amherst have been using EPA data for many years now to rank the top U.S. polluters and disseminate vital information to the public. They publish their findings annually and have just released the 2025 edition of Greenhouse Gas Emissions Index. In the interview that follows, Michael Ash, professor of economics and public policy and co-director of PERI’s Corporate Toxics Information Project, shares the latest data on the top U.S. climate pollutants and discusses the consequences of the potential end of EPA’s Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program in the fight against climate change and climate justice.

C.J. Polychroniou: For many years now, the Political Economy Research Institute (PERI) at the University of Massachusetts Amherst has been providing a valuable service to public interest in general and to activists in particular by collecting and releasing information and analysis on corporate pollution and greenhouse gas emissions through its Corporate Toxics Information Project. Last month, the 2025 edition of Greenhouse Gas Emissions Index was published, using the latest data available from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program. The index takes on new significance since the EPA has announced plans to end the program, which amounts to an erosion of the people’s right to know. But before we get to that, what does the new edition of Greenhouse Gas Emissions Index look like? Which corporations are the top climate polluters in the country, and have there been any significant changes in total emissions and rankings from last year?

Michael Ash: The top of the list remains similar; the biggest point emitters of greenhouse gases are the electrical power companies that burn fossil fuels to generate electricity. Topping the list are Vistra Energy, Southern Company, and Duke Energy. Their combined 235 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent emissions made up just under 4 percent of all U.S. contributions to climate change that year (including all sources, such as automobiles, airplanes, and home heating, not just industrial emitters). Again, the top of the list are the fossil electricity generators. Next come the major oil refiners and petrochemical processors, such as Exxon Mobil (at the number 7 spot); and that is only accounting for the direct releases from their facilities, not the releases from the fuels that they bring into the economy. (For that, see our companion list of Toxic 100 Suppliers.)

This list has been stable for some years; a company may move up or down by a position or two based on acquisitions or sales of facilities, but the list is entirely recognizable from year to year.

In which states do companies emit the most heat-trapping gas that feeds climate change, and which corporations have the highest share of residents of color living close to their polluting facilities?

We have prepared state-specific lists of greenhouse gas releasers. We stay at the company level, because the company is the crucial decision-making unit, but in each state, we rank companies based on the facilities they own in the state. The big petro states, Texas and Louisiana, top the list, by quite a lot. Fossil electricity generation is widespread; so almost everywhere has a share. A petroleum-processing industry can make individual states stand out. For example California is near the top of the state list (at number 7) because of large refineries; the top five greenhouse-gas-releasing facilities in the state are refineries owned by Marathon Petroleum, Chevron, Valero, and PBF energy, even though the electricity sector as a whole is responsible for more greenhouse gas releases in California.

We think that the state listings are particularly important in this era of diminished local news capacity. This is the type of inquiry that local news sources might pursue in the public interest.

In addition to the absolute impact rankings, we also take a look at the share of people of color living near companies’ pollution-emitting facilities. At first glance, it might seem odd to look at local populations when greenhouse gas emissions are a global problem, but almost all the greenhouse gas emissions we examine are from combustion and, hence, coupled with the release of local pollutants. These local pollutants that come with the greenhouse gases are called co-pollutants, including sulfur oxides, nitrous oxides, and particular matter, as well as a host of toxics. In addition to the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, some companies among the Top 100 Greenhouse emitters that have a particularly high share of people of color (people categorized as “minorities” in this study) living near their facilities are the chemical company LyondellBasell (72 on the overall greenhouse emissions list, with people of color composing more than 75 percent of the population within 10 miles of their plants) and BP (50 overall, with people of color composing more than 75 percent of the population near their facilities). Marathon Petroleum (14 overall) and Valero Energy (19 overall) are other high emitters with people of color composing more than 70 percent of the population near their facilities. Forty-one of the companies on the top 100 list have their emissions near populations that are more than 50 percent people of color. The country as a whole is around 40 percent people of color; 63 of the top 100 companies exceed that share in their impact.

These local co-pollutants add to the case for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. For those who harbor the view that greenhouse gas emissions are a problem for the future — a shortsighted view in my opinion, but people face a variety of constraints — the health benefits of reducing co-pollutants are local and immediate. We’d see fewer hospitalizations for asthma, less COPD [chronic obstructive pulmonary disease], fewer cases of cancer when we stop burning fossil fuels near vulnerable populations. I’m not necessarily a fan of placing dollar values on human life and health, but by reasonable estimates, the health benefits of the co-pollutant reduction alone are as big as the climate benefits. There’s a potential very large improvement in the quality of the air that we all breathe, with special benefit for the vulnerable, such as children, older people, and communities that are heavily exposed to the burden of cumulative pollution.

Isn’t climate pollution a racial justice issue since communities of color and marginalized groups disproportionately feel the effects of corporate pollution?

Climate pollution is a justice issue for a host of reasons, including the disproportionate impact of the local co-pollutants on marginalized groups, but also because climate vulnerability, for example, to extreme weather events, is higher among marginalized groups.

The Trump administration has canceled billions of dollars in clean energy projects nationwide, seeks to revive the coal industry, and contends that the EPA has no legal authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. Under these new government approaches to pollution and climate change, what incentives would U.S. corporations have to reduce greenhouse gas emissions? Indeed, isn’t it most likely to expect an increase in corporate greenhouse gas pollution in the years ahead?

The actual and pending regulatory changes at EPA are deeply troubling.

One sign of hope is that some states have enacted and many are considering state-level Climate Superfund Bills. These bills would hold corporations responsible for climate change accountable for costs of adaptation, remediation, and disaster recovery. The bills are modeled on the Superfund legislation (Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980) that sought both to recover damages and to finance cleanup from the effects of corporate toxic dumping. New York and Vermont have passed bills, of varying stringency, and legislation has also been introduced in Oregon, California, Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New Jersey, Maryland, Illinois, Virginia, and Tennessee. There is plenty of corporate pushback against these Climate Superfund bills, and we should expect to see contentious fights in the coming years. But the main point is that these laws — and the potential for a federal law if there are changes in the control of the federal government — provide significant incentives for corporations to consider future liability in making decisions about greenhouse gas emissions. So we might see efforts to curtail greenhouse gas emissions even in the face of the current administration’s hostility to greenhouse gas regulation.

Ending the EPA’s Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program, which has been tracking the climate emissions of major polluters for the last 15 years, constitutes an unmistakable attack on the right-to-know movement. However, do you think that the Trump administration’s intent to stop collecting greenhouse gas data from thousands of facilities across the United States will have an impact on environmental activism? And what effect in particular would the killing of Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program have on PERI’s efforts to continue to provide the public with valuable information and analysis on U.S. corporate pollution?

As you indicated, the EPA is in the process of eliminating the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program, the regulatory program that makes these crucial right-to-know data available to the public. This fall EPA carried out a “Reconsideration” of the program which would outright eliminate most of the reporting requirements and suspend the remainder until 2034.

We are still assessing the future of the Greenhouse 100 without the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program. The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program was extraordinarily valuable because it was mandatory and uniform – it provided a clear look at greenhouse gas pollution from U.S.-based facilities, and it was hard to cherry pick or to greenwash. The problems don’t go away when the reporting goes away, of course, and I expect that environmental activism will continue. It will simply continue with less information, and this important tool won’t be available to the full set of stakeholders, including socially responsible investors, environmental and community activists, state and local regulators, and even companies themselves as they seek to improve their operations and benchmark against comparison companies. It’s a right-to-know disaster and it means that all of us will be operating in the dark.",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2150288315-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-12-20 09:58:47.113887

Mandates, surcharges, restrictions and regulatory decisions enshrined into law are the reason why energy prices in New York are less affordable than elsewhere. These high energy prices make it harder to live and work in New York.

New York utilities are forced, by law, to charge you with a “delivery fee” which is actually a subsidy for renewable energy companies; the money is collected through your energy bill and passed along to renewable energy companies to artificially lower the cost of producing renewable energy sources, like wind and solar. Not only does that jack up the price you pay but, it also wrecks havoc on the energy market.

As a result of renewable energy subsidies, paid by you, the customer, New York’s nuclear energy producers have become more unprofitable. Since it is too expensive for nuclear energy companies to operate in New York State, the state subsidizes nuclear energy profits. Guess who pays for that? You do.

Moreover, New York has made it harder for energy companies to source affordable power from within the state. We sit on some of the most reliable natural gas reserves in the country, yet Albany Democrats have blocked pipelines, prohibited new development, and forced utilities to import natural gas from Pennsylvania, Ohio and even Canada. Every mile of transportation adds cost. Those costs are passed directly to you.

It gets worse. New York mandates are requiring homes, businesses, and vehicles to become all-electric based upon arbitrary dates and for a purely ideological purpose. Even the delay of those mandates (whether from the governor’s arbitrary benevolence or from a legal challenge) causes unnecessary anxiety and increased costs. Who bears the cost to switch a house, vehicle, or business to all-electric? You.

Additionally, Albany Democrats never accounted for the cost to implement those mandates or the infrastructure needed to supply a statewide massive increase in electricity. We know that peak load times will cause issues with our grid. To meet those peak loads, utilities will need to build new transmission lines, new substations, new storage facilities and new backup capacity, very little of which has been funded by Albany. Is it any surprise that utility companies are asking for rate increases to pass these costs onto you, the consumer?

According to the state Comptroller’s July 2024 audit, New York hasn’t even calculated the full cost of this transition. The audit states plainly that the state has no viable funding plan, no accurate cost estimates and no backup strategy for implementing technology, like long-duration storage, that doesn’t exist yet at scale. Yet, Albany Democrats continue to stand by their deadlines, mandates, and penalties as though these realities don’t matter creating an unaffordable energy crisis in New York.

The government should not be making it harder on its own citizens. New Yorkers deserve honest, transparent, and affordable energy choices. We can and need to fix it. We should focus on removing or reducing the state-mandated surcharges and hidden fees that quietly inflate every electric bill. You deserve to know exactly which portion of your bill goes to state mandated subsidies. We should eliminate unfunded electrification mandates that pressure homeowners, small businesses and local governments to replace heating systems, vehicles and appliances. Rather, we should permit consumer choice.

We must restore access to New York’s own abundant energy resources, like natural gas, and support the responsible permitting of local energy development, expand nuclear generation and strengthen cogeneration, as the reliable backbones of grid stability.

We should subject New York energy, including renewable energy sources, to the free market. Market competition will fuel a better, safer, and lower priced product. My goal is straightforward: an energy policy grounded in engineering and common sense, that strengthens the grid, meets the energy needs of all New Yorkers, and which lowers your energy bills.

The Marcellus Shale boom propelled Pennsylvania into one of the nation’s largest producers of natural gas — second only to Texas.
Due to their decreased in-state generation, RGGI states have relied on electricity-exporting states to make up the difference.
The cap-and-trade program hampers affordable energy generation, jeopardizes grid reliability, and stalls out economic competition.
Considering the energy needed to power the massive data-processing infrastructure that AI demands, unleashing Pennsylvania energy from the restraints of heavy-handed policies makes the most financial sense.","As states grapple with rising electricity prices, lawmakers struggle to strike a balance between affordable energy and responsible environmental stewardship.

Achieving both may seem impossible, but Pennsylvania proves otherwise. Over the last decade, the Keystone State has aptly demonstrated that states do not need to sacrifice energy development in favor of heavy-handed Green New Deal-style restrictions.

Pennsylvania lawmakers arrived at this conclusion on the heels of a four-month budget impasse. The monthslong stalemate ended when Gov. Josh Shapiro and the General Assembly agreed to a significant compromise: The Keystone State would formally resign from the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI).

RGGI, commonly referred to as “Reggie,” is a multistate cap-and-trade program. Under RGGI, states cap a specific amount of carbon emissions and then auction off emissions allowances to energy producers.

Pennsylvania has had a long and complicated history with RGGI.

In 2019, Gov. Tom Wolf unilaterally entered Pennsylvania without a legislative mandate. However, since only the Pennsylvania General Assembly has the legal authority to tax, the Commonwealth Court ruled that the carbon tax was unconstitutional. Shapiro, despite stating his “real concerns” about RGGI on the campaign trail, sued to stay in the compact. However, thanks to Pennsylvania Republicans who fought tooth and nail during budget negotiations to codify a RGGI exit, that appeal won’t see its day in court.

Like most “green” energy proposals, RGGI would have come with significant costs. One economic model estimated that RGGI would increase Pennsylvanians’ electric bills by 30 percent. Indeed, this model is somewhat dated: RGGI allowances have increased since its publication, so the actual cost is likely higher.

RGGI has already wreaked havoc outside of Pennsylvania. One estimate suggests that RGGI would add more than $1.8 billion in annual costs to the 13 states (including Pennsylvania) and the District of Columbia that comprise the regional grid managed by PJM Interconnection.

Considering these costs, Pennsylvania, which generates nearly one-fifth of PJM’s net electricity and leads the nation in electricity exports, couldn’t afford to compromise its robust energy sector.

The Keystone State serves as a great case study against RGGI. In 2025, Pennsylvania’s Independent Fiscal Office (IFO)–an independent nonpartisan agency that analyzes statewide policies–revealed that, between 2019 and 2024, carbon emissions in Pennsylvania decreased by 9 percent while the commonwealth’s electricity generation increased by 5 percent.

Yes, you read that right: Pennsylvania increased production and decreased emissions–all without RGGI.

How did the commonwealth pull this off? Two words: natural gas.

The Marcellus Shale boom propelled Pennsylvania into one of the nation’s largest producers of natural gas — second only to Texas. Since natural gas burns cleaner than coal, Pennsylvania’s emissions dropped precipitously.

Pennsylvania isn’t alone. Natural gas has been a leading national driver in emissions reductions. Between 2005 and 2019, the United States removed about 819 million metric tons of carbon dioxide. Of that total, the U.S. Energy Information Administration attributes nearly two-thirds of the reduction to natural gas.

Meanwhile, RGGI states come nowhere close to matching Pennsylvania’s numbers. RGGI states have not so much cut emissions as they have exported them. A 2018 Congressional Research Service report found that electricity generation in non-RGGI states increased by 8 percent during the first years of RGGI auctions.

Due to their decreased in-state generation, RGGI states have relied on electricity-exporting states to make up the difference. A Cato Institute study found that, between 2007 and 2015, RGGI states doubled their electricity imports.

RGGI was, at best, a solution in search of a problem. The cap-and-trade program hampers affordable energy generation, jeopardizes grid reliability, and stalls out economic competition.

Meanwhile, Pennsylvania’s exit from RGGI couldn’t have come at a better time. With abundant and affordable energy readily available, the Keystone State is well-positioned for next-generation technology and industry–namely, artificial intelligence (AI).

Considering the energy needed to power the massive data-processing infrastructure that AI demands, unleashing Pennsylvania energy from the restraints of heavy-handed policies makes the most financial sense. By choosing to focus on market-driven energy solutions rather than cap-and-trade schemes, Pennsylvania has maintained its competitive edge in hosting these future industries and leading the nation in energy innovation.

Pennsylvania offers a clear roadmap. Exiting RGGI will prove to be a smart stride forward into an energy-abundant, innovation-driven future. Pennsylvania has demonstrated that states can have it all: They can lower emissions, increase electricity generation, export power, and build cutting-edge industries–all at once. Most importantly, they don’t need a top-heavy regulatory environment to do so.

States on the fence about their RGGI membership–Virginia in particular–should follow Pennsylvania’s lead.

Wes Moore on Tuesday announced an executive order directing state agencies to identify ways to reduce rising electricity costs, as residents across the state face sharply higher utility bills.

Moore said electricity rates in Maryland have increased by 44 percent since 2020, with some households seeing their bills double between the winter of 2024 and the winter of 2025. The administration attributes the increases to several factors, including growing demand on the energy grid from data centers, aging transmission infrastructure, and the retirement of power plants.

The order, titled ""Building an Affordable and Reliable Energy Future,"" is not a law but a directive outlining priorities for Moore’s administration. It calls on state agencies to accelerate the development of new power generation and strengthen the state’s electric grid.

Among its key provisions, the order seeks to streamline the siting and construction of power plants by identifying locations where facilities can be built more quickly and by offering incentive packages to developers. It also encourages the use of state-owned land and rights-of-way for new battery storage facilities and high-capacity transmission lines, addressing what officials describe as outdated power lines across Maryland.

In addition, the executive order asks the Maryland Public Service Commission to review the billing practices of utilities, including Pepco, as part of a broader look at consumer costs.

Moore emphasized that the order is a starting point rather than an immediate fix.

“These important actions don’t guarantee lower bills next month,” Moore said. “We need our private-sector partners — many of whom are multi-state and multinational conglomerates — to feel the same urgency that we feel.”

Republican leaders criticized the governor’s approach. House Minority Leader Jason Buckel blamed long-standing Democratic energy policies for Maryland’s dependence on imported electricity.

“The radical energy policies pushed by the Democratic supermajority over the last two decades have driven energy producers out of our state,” Buckel said in a statement. “Until we address the issues at the heart of the problem, Marylanders will continue to see their electric bills soar.”

The executive order comes ahead of the upcoming General Assembly session in Annapolis, which begins in a few weeks. Lawmakers from both parties have said affordability will be a top priority, and it remains to be seen how the governor’s plan will factor into legislative debates.",https://media.wusa9.com/assets/WUSA/images/c8c55488-c7f7-423b-9999-ab5dfc8d5af6/20251219T223436/c8c55488-c7f7-423b-9999-ab5dfc8d5af6_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-12-20 17:59:01.813703

Countries with ample fossil fuels like Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Norway, and Qatar will become richer and more influential.
In this still fossil-fuel dominated world, Canada will have great cards to play and now may even be willing to play them.
In an ideal world, energy growth would be a common agenda in North America, faced with challenges from Russia, the Middle East and China.
Asia is a boom market for fossil fuels, and Canada could enrich itself hugely through this trade.","Sometimes policy change is necessitated by reality. The welcome new entente cordiale between Ottawa and Alberta, fast tracking new energy developments, marks a pleasant example.

This is all the more remarkable since Prime Minister Mark Carney, was once a leading voice against fossil fuels; as head of the Bank of England, he led the charge for banks to bankroll the much-ballyhooed transition to renewables. Yet a decade later, he appears to have shifted from a “net-zero” crusader to seeking to become “an energy superpower.”

What changed? This corresponds to the global weakening of climate hysteria. As Matt Ridley noted recently in the Spectator, extreme claims of an imminent collapse of humanity, so promoted by the likes of Greta Thunberg and groups like Extinction Rebellion, have lost their credibility on everything from sea-level rise to imminent mass starvation. To be sure, some media — like the New York Times or John Stewart’s “The Daily Show” — are still predicting massive dislocation in the near future, with Manhattan poised to be soon engulfed by rising waters. But this seems little more than an anti-Trump laugh line.

Nothing better illustrates the climatistas’ decline than the largely ignored COP 30 climate conference in Brazil, which attracted few world leaders. The rejection comes from a growing realization that solar and wind cannot power growing economies, something now widely accepted outside academia, mainstream media, and the NGO complex. As Axios recently reported, Democratic congresspeople have all but abandoned talk about “the Green New Deal,” even amidst their never-ending denunciations of all things Trump.

The shift gained more credibility when the magazine Nature recently retracted a 2024 study predicting economic collapse due to climate change. Reality has started to bite, even in my home state of California, a bastion of climate hysteria. Governor Gavin Newsom, an avid supporter of net zero, earlier this year basically fell on his knees before Big Oil in April, when two companies announced they were shutting their Californian oil refineries as a result of oppressive green regulations. He also kept the state’s last nuclear plant going.

As they shy away from climate catastrophism, resurgent progressives in the U.S. focus rightly on issues like cost of living, medical care, and jobs. They realize very few working class voters — now up for grabs in the next election — actually prioritize climate policy; in a recent Monmouth poll, just one percent of working-class (non-college) voters identify climate change as the biggest concern facing their families. Recent U.S. polling reveals that belief in predominately manmade climate change is now at 45 per cent, according to Pew, and enthusiasm for spending money on climate initiatives has plummeted.

Perhaps even more surprising, politicians in deep-green Europe are beginning to recognize that green obsessions undermine their own industries. Net-zero policies, notes a recent OECD study, have doubled the rate of job losses in high-carbon jobs, which traditionally paid higher salaries to mostly male, non-college educated workers than the retail, tourism and other low-end service jobs that replaced them. Virtually all the places with the highest energy costs are those with the strictest renewable policies — Germany, California, and the U.K. Overall, British, Italian and Germany industrial users pay roughly twice more for electricity than the U.S. or Canada.

So, here’s the reality: oil and gas remain the dominant source of energy, with even coal, a dirtier fuel than natural gas, making a comeback. Despite billions spent by governments — taxpayers — to subsidize renewables, global hydrocarbon use, notes energy expert Robert Bryce, is not only thirty times larger than wind and solar combined, but is also growing faster. In the last decade, the world added 9,000 terawatt-hours per year of energy consumption from wind and solar but 13,000 from fossil fuels.

Adding to the power grid is increasingly important with the rise of artificial intelligence. This appears to be leading to greater fondness among oligarchs and investors faced with a desperate need for reliable, affordable energy, which solar and wind are not. Now, some embrace nuclear power, long verboten among the green activists they so generously funded.

This shift away from tough climate policies will shape global politics for the next decade or more. Countries with ample fossil fuels like Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Norway, and Qatar will become richer and more influential. Other, more troubled oil producers, like Russia, Iran and Venezuela are able to survive, in the face of awful governance, only because they still have their share of “black gold.” The developing world, notably Africa and India, will either develop their own resources, or import huge quantities.

In this still fossil-fuel dominated world, Canada will have great cards to play and now may even be willing to play them. These are also Canada’s biggest exports; it is the world’s fourth largest crude exporter. Like the United States, the world’s leading energy producer, Canada’s influence will be tied to its natural resources.

Canada’s embrace of energy production also constitutes a way to work against fossil-fuel-funded malefactors like Iran, Qatar, Venezuela, and Russia. It is also a way to counter China, which emits more GHGs responsible for more than 30 per cent of global carbon emissions as of 2024, twice the American share.

China, which lacks huge oil or gas resources, has seized on Western climate policies as a way to penetrate markets for solar panels and electric vehicles. This leads to praise from some greens, but the Middle Kingdom is not exactly abandoning fossil fuels; indeed, its EV and panel industries rest on power generated by its over 3,000 coal-power plants, which accounted for 64.4 per cent of global emissions in 2023.

In an ideal world, energy growth would be a common agenda in North America, faced with challenges from Russia, the Middle East and China. But Donald Trump’s misplaced idea of national interest makes such cooperation difficult for now. So, Canada will need to find other markets for crude and other commodities, precisely what proposed West Coast LNG and pipelines would address. Asia is a boom market for fossil fuels, and Canada could enrich itself hugely through this trade.

This is the moment for Canada to assert its economic power and tell us Yankees that you can play the “great game” of power politics, too. Carney’s shift also provides an opportunity — after a decade of disappointment — to get the country back on track and reassert itself as one of the world’s great liberal democracies.

The utility has justified that scale by pointing to forecasts of booming electricity demand due to new data-center construction.
In recent weeks, however, even Georgia Power has reduced its data-center demand projections.
Georgia Power can expect to profit handsomely from the commission’s decision.
To avoid passing extra costs onto consumers, Georgia Power would need gigawatts’ worth of data centers to be built and to continue buying electricity for decades.","The Georgia Public Service Commission on Friday approved a controversial plan that will allow the state’s biggest utility to commence one of the largest new fossil-fuel buildouts in the country — a move that critics fear will raise utility bills for most Georgia residents over the coming years.

The last-minute settlement was approved unanimously by the five commissioners, all Republicans. The vote came just weeks before two of those commissioners are set to be replaced by Democrats who won upset victories in the November election by running on the issue of energy affordability.

Back in November, staff at the PSC recommended that the commission allow Georgia Power to build only about one-third of the nearly 10 gigawatts of new gas-fired power plants and batteries the utility had requested. Friday’s decision instead gives it the go-ahead to move forward on building the full total.

The utility has justified that scale by pointing to forecasts of booming electricity demand due to new data-center construction. In recent weeks, however, even Georgia Power has reduced its data-center demand projections. And across the state and the country, concerns are rising that the boom in artificial intelligence that is driving data-center investments may be a bubble about to burst.

That’s why PSC staff deemed the utility’s full buildout plan too risky — and why energy experts and consumer and environmental advocates oppose it. Should Georgia Power build all of that infrastructure while data-center demand fails to materialize, its customers would be forced to pay higher bills for the unnecessary power plants.

“It is a massive financial gamble,” said Jennifer Whitfield, a senior attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center, one of several groups protesting Georgia Power’s gas-heavy buildout plan. ​“The bottom line is that we don’t need this much energy based on the data that’s been provided.”

The PSC staff expect the plan to raise average household utility bills by about $20 per month, or possibly more if gas prices rise or data-center demand fails to show up, according to testimony from November. Those costs would be layered on top of six rate hikes since late 2022 that have already increased average residential bills by $43 per month, and which helped propel the two incoming Democratic commissioners to victory in November.

Georgia Power can expect to profit handsomely from the commission’s decision. The utility revealed in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing last week that the plan would allow it to invest $16.3 billion in ​“company-owned projects” — capital investments on which the utility earns a guaranteed rate of return.

To avoid passing extra costs onto consumers, Georgia Power would need gigawatts’ worth of data centers to be built and to continue buying electricity for decades.

Right now, it’s highly uncertain whether those data centers will ever show up.

“[O]nly a fraction of the requested capacity is backed by data center customers that have signed contracts for electric service, and even less have signed contracts covered by the protections contemplated in the Commission’s new rules and regulations,” the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy and Sierra Club wrote in a briefing filed with the commission. ​“With no data center customer committed to pay for most of the capacity Georgia Power is requesting for the entirety of the assets’ lifetimes, ratepayers will inevitably be on the hook.”

PSC staff in November testified that only about 3.1 gigawatts of Georgia Power’s buildout should be approved right away, based on the number of data centers that have executed contracts with the utility. It also proposed allowing about 4.3 gigawatts more on condition that additional data centers sign definitive contracts by March 2026.

Indeed, PSC staff’s forecasts of demand growth between now and 2031 were far lower than Georgia Power’s: about 6 gigawatts less under a ​“lower large-load materialization assumption,” and about 4 gigawatts less under a ​“greater large-load materialization case.”

Utilities and regulators across the country are struggling to manage similar mismatches between the unprecedented boom in proposed data centers and the increasing uncertainty that those plans will come to fruition.

When the new Democratic commissioners take office next month, it’s unclear whether they’ll be able to adjust the plan or rein in costs.

Foes of the plan are pressing commissioners to use their authority to force Georgia Power to update its load-growth forecasts and report on changing costs for the power plants it plans to build, and to retract approval for spending plans that may no longer be justified by growing demand.

But Whitfield noted that Friday’s vote by the commission authorizes Georgia Power to begin charging customers for the expenses it incurs to build and procure the resources approved by the plan.

“If in the future the commission were to modify its certification order — which it could — Georgia Power would still be able to recover any costs it incurred up to that point,” she said.

It’s also unclear whether the settlement agreement will force Georgia Power to follow through on its public pledges to limit the impact of its data center–driven investments on everyday customers, Whitfield said. Her group filed a motion earlier this week asking the commission to order Georgia Power to provide more information about its plan to use revenue from data centers and other large customers to put ​“downward pressure” on rates for typical residential customers.

“There are so many loopholes in the financial assurances that staff tried to achieve when it entered into this stipulation,” she said. ​“The end result is nearly meaningless for a typical Georgia Power customer … The reality is, we just don’t have any reassurance that all of us aren’t going to be on the financial hook for it.”",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/GettyImages-976036186-c.jpeg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=c5c64e5f78783c1834605b553b906ef8,N,,2025-12-20 17:58:56.399364

The merger between Trump Media & Technology and TAE Technologies could lead to one of the world’s first publicly traded fusion energy companies, the two companies said Thursday.

What is TAE Technologies?

TAE Technologies is a private company based in Foothill Ranch, Calif. It has been raising funds for commercial-scale nuclear fusion, a method of energy production that supporters say could revolutionize access to electricity. Founded in 1998, the company has built and operated five fusion reactors and raised more than $1.3 billion.

Fusion uses the same process that powers the sun to produce potentially limitless energy. Experts say it hasn’t been achieved on a large scale because the process is volatile and expensive. TAE is trying to develop the technology needed to reduce the size, cost and complexity of fusion reactors.

“Our talented team, through its commitment and dedication to science, is poised to solve the immense global challenge of energy scarcity,” TAE Chief Executive Michl Binderbauer said in a statement. “Recent breakthroughs have prepared us to... commercialize our fusion technology.”

What is the political history of Truth Social?

Truth Social was launched in 2022 as Trump created an alternative to mainstream social media, which was increasingly restricting and blocking his posts and profiles, as well as those of his allies and supporters. It began trading on the Nasdaq stock exchange through a 2024 merger with a special purpose acquisition company.

While most social media platforms have lifted restrictions on Trump’s posts, he still primarily posts on his own platform.

Though Trump and companies he is associated with control more than a 40% stake in the company, much of his investment is managed by others to avoid a conflict of interest during his term as president. Some analysts suggest his indirect association with a new company in a highly regulated industry could also lead to issues.

TAE will need significant investment and regulation to advance, which makes Trump’s ties a major conflict, Richard Painter, a former White House ethics lawyer in the George W. Bush administration, told the Associated Press.

“He’s jumping into this industry just like he jumped into cryptocurrency a couple of years ago,” Painter said. “Just as the United States government is gonna get all involved in it. And it’s so obvious that there’s a huge conflict of interest.”

Trump Media shares, which had fallen more than 80% from their 2024 peak, have skyrocketed around 50% since the deal was announced.

The company now has a market value of more than $4.5 billion.

Why are the companies merging?

The parent company of Trump’s social media site, Truth Social, Trump Media & Technology, previously had little to do with energy production. The company agreed to merge with Alphabet-backed TAE Technologies, with the aim of paving the way for easier access to abundant electricity.

The merger aims to help both companies diversify and raise more money.

It is an attempt to combine Trump Media’s “significant access to capital” with TAE’s “leading fusion technology,” the companies said in a release.

They plan to begin construction in 2026 on the first-ever utility-scale fusion power plant.

“Fusion power plants are expected to provide economic, abundant and dependable electricity that would help America win the AI revolution,” the release said.

The boom in popularity of AI chatbots such as ChatGPT has created a seemingly insatiable new demand for power.

The Georgia Institute of Technology says modern AI data centers use as much electricity as a small city. As AI models grow, they demand even more power.

What are the terms of the deal?

The all-stock transaction announced this week values each share of TAE Technologies at $53.89, although it is a private company. Trump Media has agreed to provide $200 million in cash to TAE upon closing, expected in mid-2026.

When the merger is complete, TAE and Trump Media shareholders will each own about 50% of the combined company.

Trump Media will be the holding company for TAE, TAE Power Solutions and TAE Life Sciences.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/27aeaad/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2647x1390+0+188/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fa9%2Fc4%2F2690a5634eec7e5a995ae7436c74%2F613604351fc4446a917d947a470e6517,N,,2025-12-20 09:57:50.193112

The amendment does not apply to onshore wind or solar energy projects, but the bill also did not explicitly address new administration rules that complicate their federal approvals.
Other key provisions include narrowing the scope of what is considered a “major federal action” for triggering NEPA, and establishing a 150-day limit for NEPA claims and challenges.

“It can be a bit arduous … so something like the SPEED Act could help expedite the process.” Eleven Democrats voted for the bill in the House, including chief cosponsor, Rep. Golden.","The U.S. House of Representatives ended its legislative session for 2025 by passing a permitting reform bill aimed to shorten timelines for major federal infrastructure projects and reduce delays caused by what bill sponsors describe as “frivolous” litigation. After passing the House, the bill was referred to the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, which is expected to take up the measure in 2026.

While the bill, known as the SPEED Act (Standardizing Permitting and Expediting Economic Development Act), has some measure of bipartisan support, it passed the House Dec. 18 by a divided 221-196 vote, with several Democrats objecting to a late-stage amendment that bars it from being applied for offshore wind energy projects, which could face Trump administration delay or cancellation.

The amendment does not apply to onshore wind or solar energy projects, but the bill also did not explicitly address new administration rules that complicate their federal approvals.

The original legislation, introduced by House Natural Resources Committee Chair Bruce Westerman (R-Ark.) and Jared Golden (D-Maine), would have limited the executive branch’s ability to reverse earlier decisions to advance projects following reviews under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). Other key provisions include narrowing the scope of what is considered a “major federal action” for triggering NEPA, and establishing a 150-day limit for NEPA claims and challenges.

Environmental advocates were sharply critical of the legislation even while acknowledging that there is room to streamline project reviews. Matthew Davis, former federal environmental scientist and League of Conservation Voters vice president of federal policy, said in a statement that “the extreme amendments to the SPEED Act fueled by misinformation that explicitly attack clean energy reveal the bill for what it always has been: a fossil fuel giveaway that cuts out community input and puts our health and safety at risk.” He added, “Congress should be focused on real solutions to skyrocketing energy prices starting with stopping Trump’s effort to ban clean energy and speeding up the approval of grid improvements and clean energy projects that are cheap and quick to deploy.”

Natural Resources Defense Council President and CEO Manish Bapna said in a statement that although there could be a “conversation to be had” about reforming the review process, the SPEED Act should be a “non-starter” in the Senate.

Construction Industry Support

Construction industry groups generally support the legislation. Associated Builders and Contractors’ vice president of government affairs Kristen Swearingen said the SPEED Act would “provide project sponsors and contractors with greater certainty to plan, invest and deliver even the most complex construction projects—certainty that is essential to meeting the nation’s infrastructure needs.”

Sean O’Neill, senior vice president of government affairs for the American Cement Association (formerly known as the Portland Cement Association), told ENR that the bill would expedite construction of necessary energy, transportation, flood control and other kind of essential infrastructure projects.

He noted that in the cement manufacturing sector, cement is not only a vital material for construction projects, but that also, many cement suppliers are considering reducing carbon emissions at their manufacturing facilities by adding carbon capture and sequestration technologies. Those upgrades can themselves trigger NEPA reviews, he said. “It can be a bit arduous … so something like the SPEED Act could help expedite the process.”

Eleven Democrats voted for the bill in the House, including chief cosponsor, Rep. Golden. “Being a good steward of our environment doesn’t mean we must tolerate a years long permitting process that is onerous, overly complex and ripe for litigation abuses,"" he said after the passage. ""We need robust power production that does not discriminate between energy sources. These investments will create jobs, support our economy, keep prices down and help us maintain energy independence.”

Trump loyalists Andy Harris (R-Md.), Chris Smith (R-N.J.) and Jeff Van Drew (R-N.J.), who proposed the amendment, said a legislative fix was essential to allow the administration to continue to be able to cancel offshore wind projects, particularly in Maryland and New York, where many efforts are under development but face hostile opposition from the administration. Many actions to cancel or hamper offshore wind projects have also been met with state lawsuits or renegotiations to allow them to proceed.",https://www.enr.com/ext/resources/2025/12/19/Westerman-at-hearing_Web.png?height=635&t=1766176712&width=1200,N,,2025-12-20 14:58:44.311835

This plan means more money stays in your pocket while we power Georgia’s future,” said Georgia Power’s chief Kim Greene.
“Today, commissioners chose to put this $60 billion risk on the backs of everyday Georgians, not Georgia Power.
“We’re being asked to risk our health and wellbeing so Georgia Power shareholders can get richer.
Without seeing the calculations, she said the public is forced to accept Georgia Power’s promises on faith.","Georgia regulators unanimously approved a massive expansion of the state’s power grid Friday, approving Georgia Power’s request for nearly 10,000 megawatts of new energy capacity despite concerns over transparency and the potential financial risk to ratepayers.

The vote by the Public Service Commission greenlights a plan that relies heavily on new fossil fuel infrastructure, with five new natural gas plants to meet surging demand from the growth of data centers. While supporters argued that the expansion is needed to keep growing the state’s economy, the hearing was dominated by debate over whether the utility has provided enough evidence that an agreement between commission staff and Georgia Power allows at least $8.50 per month in “downward pressure” on residential rates.

Following the vote, Georgia Power celebrated the decision, saying that the new revenue from large customers will directly benefit families.

“We know every dollar counts. This plan means more money stays in your pocket while we power Georgia’s future,” said Georgia Power’s chief Kim Greene. “Unlike any other market in the country, we’re doing things differently here in Georgia to capture and serve this projected unprecedented growth. Large energy users are paying more so families and small businesses can pay less, and that’s a great result for Georgians.”

Commission Chair Jason Shaw said after the hearing that the commission did its “duty” to ensure companies coming to Georgia have power.

“Our job is to deal with growth,” he said.

But opponents of the power expansion criticized commissioners for potentially failing to protect residential customers from the cost of building massive power infrastructure largely to power data centers, which includes the addition of five new methane gas-burning units at plants Bowen, McIntosh and Wansley. Critics have argued that there is no guarantee the forecasted demand will come to fruition.

“Today, commissioners chose to put this $60 billion risk on the backs of everyday Georgians, not Georgia Power. They had the chance to meaningfully protect existing customers, and they did not,” said Bob Sherrier, a staff attorney for the Southern Environmental Law Center, in a statement.

Critics also questioned the morality of the decision in light of the utility’s financial performance. Southern Company, Georgia Power’s parent company, reported earning $1.7 billion between July and September of this year, an increase from the same period last year.

“We’re being asked to risk our health and wellbeing so Georgia Power shareholders can get richer. It’s immoral and unjust,” said Codi Norred, executive director of Georgia Interfaith Power and Light.

Abe Scarr, energy and utilities program director for Georgia PIRG, which is a public interest research group, said that if the projected demand from data centers fails to materialize or cover costs, ratepayers will face long-term consequences.

“If the demand doesn’t show up, if data centers fail to cover their costs, and when gas prices spike again, Georgia Power customers will be left holding the bag for decades to come,” Scarr said.

Environmental advocacy organizations filed a motion Wednesday aimed at delaying the decision until Georgia Power provided the data behind its projections, specifically the math supporting a promise that the new industrial usage would help lower residential rates.

“This motion right now is not about whether their math is right or wrong. It’s about showing their work,” said Jennifer Whitfield, an attorney with SELC, to the commission. Without seeing the calculations, she said the public is forced to accept Georgia Power’s promises on faith.

The motion to delay was ultimately denied Friday. Brandon Marzo, representing Georgia Power, dismissed the interveners’ concerns, telling the commissioners that Whitfield was “confused by the facts” and that the necessary information was already available in the record.

Marzo framed the massive capacity request as an urgent response to economic expansion.

“The state is growing, commissioners,” Marzo said. “The load is coming.”

He insisted that the influx of large industrial customers would benefit residential ratepayers by spreading costs over a larger base. He said that Georgia Power’s projected $8.50 monthly savings for the average customer.

Commission staff came to an agreement with Georgia Power but warned that the years 2029 through 2031 would be critical for monitoring progress to ensure that Georgia Power’s promised $8.50 “downward pressure” pledge would materialize.

“It will be the responsibility of this commission to observe, to engage and if needed to act,” said commission attorney Chris Collado.

Environmental and consumer advocacy groups remained skeptical. Sherrier reminded the commission of past promises that ultimately fell short, saying that similar promises were made that the costs of the Plant Vogtle nuclear expansion would not be passed down to ratepayers. He advocated for the staff’s original recommendation of “conditional certification,” which would have approved resources only after contracts with new customers were signed.

“If they’re wrong and the load doesn’t commit, conditional certification ensures that we don’t have to pay for those resources. We don’t have to pay this round,” Sherrier said.

Curt Thompson of the Sierra Club echoed these concerns, saying that “no amount of alleged downward pressure on rates can ensure that the customer bills won’t go up.”",https://georgiarecorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DSC06778-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2025-12-20 11:59:48.748118

Capitol News Illinois is a nonprofit, nonpartisan news service that distributes state government coverage to hundreds of news outlets statewide.","CHICAGO — The Illinois Commerce Commission approved lower than requested rate increases for the state’s major electric utilities in separate decisions Thursday after they spent beyond their 2024 budgets.

Under the state’s Public Utilities Act, the utility companies are allowed to petition the ICC to recover capital expenses incurred above their projected budgets. The ICC ruled that the full amounts requested — $268.5 million for ComEd and $59.6 million for Ameren Illinois — were not proven by the utilities to be “reasonable and prudent.”

The ICC shaved off $25.4 million from ComEd’s request and $11.2 million from Ameren’s.

That means typical residential customers of ComEd in northern Illinois and Chicago can expect to see their monthly electric bills increase by an average of $3.10 per month, according to a company spokesperson. That is slightly less than the $3.41 increase customers would have seen if the ICC had approved ComEd’s full request.

Ameren’s request was expected to increase rates by $0.39 per month for typical residential customers in central and southern Illinois, if approved in full. With the reduced amount approved, the company expects current electric delivery rates to remain relatively unchanged.

In both cases, the new rates will go into effect in January. Precise impacts on customer bills will depend on service class and energy usage levels.

Accountability

ICC Chairman Doug Scott said in a statement that the decision was intended to hold the utilities accountable for their performance.

“The ICC’s decision today reiterates that unsupported departures from Ameren’s approved grid plan are inconsistent with the goals of the grid planning process, and it is the utility’s responsibility to prove that any adjustments made are reasonable and prudent for maintaining our power system,” Scott said. He released a parallel statement regarding ComEd.

Under Illinois’ Clean Energy Jobs Act, passed in 2021, the ICC has the power to reject utility rate hikes that they deem cost inefficient. Before the passage of the CEJA, rates were set by a formula — a system that critics said lacked adequate consumer protections.

ComEd disagreed that the disallowed costs were unreasonable and imprudent, saying in a statement that the costs were used for necessary system improvements and maintenance.

But Sarah Moskowitz, executive director of the Citizens Utility Board praised the ICC for “weeding out wasteful and inappropriate spending.”

CUB pointed to recent rate hikes granted to both companies and argued that utilities should be disallowed from filing reconciliation requests altogether.

“We will always challenge wasteful spending by the utilities,” Moskowitz wrote in a statement earlier this month. “And, while consumer protections have improved, we support ending this reconciliation benefit for utilities. If Ameren blows through its budget in a given year, customers shouldn’t have to pay the excess.”

The commission approved revised grid plans with rate increases for both companies last year. The ICC granted rate increases of $606 million for ComEd and $308.6 million for Ameren, both to be spread through 2027.

For ComEd, the ICC declined to approve recovery of overrun costs related to ComEd’s “mismanaged” customer care and billing rollout last year, finding the costs to be “imprudently incurred.”

Moskowitz agreed that ComEd customers shouldn’t have to pay for the utility’s “incompetence.”

The commission also refused to make ratepayers cover $10.7 million to reimburse Ameren shareholders for contributions to the company’s employee retirement benefit fund.

CUB said Ameren could not prove its shareholders made those contributions. The ICC, which had found the proposal “inconsistent with Commission practice and law” at least three times prior, said in its ruling that it found no reason to come to a different conclusion this time around.

As part of the decision, both utilities will also be required to submit affordability data and cost benefit analyses of related grid plan projects in future reconciliation requests. That rule is intended to help the ICC and other stakeholders analyze the companies’ performance in meeting its goals.

Zambito, Chris McKenna",,,,,https://www.poughkeepsiejournal.com/story/news/2025/12/19/climate-groups-condemn-hochul-pausing-law-requiring-all-electric-buildings/87840056007/,"Through a spokesman, Hochul said the decision on the all-electric buildings law was meant to ensure it survives legal challenges.
“Governor Hochul remains resolved to providing more affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy for New Yorkers.""
“So I need all the champions of this (climate) law,” Hochul said.
The downstate electric grid is now nearly totally reliant on natural gas since the shutdown of the Indian Point nuclear power plant in 2021.
But we’ll see.” Thomas C. Zambito covers energy, transportation and economic growth for the USA TODAY Network’s New York State team.","In mid-November, the Hochul Administration agreed to pause a law that threatens to cut into fossil fuel industry profits by requiring new buildings seven stories or lower to have electric heat and appliances.

The law backed by Gov. Kathy Hochul in 2023 represented a victory for the state’s clean energy advocates, one that would reduce planet-warming carbon emissions in buildings — a leading source of greenhouse gases — keeping them from fouling the air for decades to come.

State Republicans waged a relentless campaign to undermine the idea, casting it as another costly, green energy mandate designed to separate New Yorkers from their gas stoves and furnaces.

So the administration’s November pivot — delaying the law’s January start while a legal challenge from the natural gas industry plays out — was viewed as a betrayal by some of Hochul’s fellow Democrats.

It was the word they repeated over and over during a conference call the day after the announcement. Brooklyn Assemblymember Marcela Mitaynes said the governor’s “two-steps-forward, one-step back” approach to climate initiatives wasn’t working. Hochul needed to go on the offensive against a president who entered the White House declaring it was time to “Drill Baby Drill,” others declared.

“Now is the time to stand up and fight for what we know is right, for what science tells us is right,” Assemblywoman Dana Levenberg, a Hudson Valley Democrat said.

“It just doesn’t make sense,” she added. “The all-electric buildings law is forward-looking legislation that makes environmental and economic sense particularly when you consider the higher cost of natural gas delivery versus electricity.”

Hochul’s decision to delay the law’s implementation has turned up the volume on criticism from climate advocates on the left who are questioning the governor’s commitment to the cause and threatening payback if things don’t start to go their way.

Climate advocates condemn the pause as a setback

Days before news of the all-electric buildings pivot broke, Food and Water Action, the political arm of the influential environmental watchdog, announced it was endorsing Lt. Gov. Antonio Delgado in his long shot bid to unseat Hochul in June’s Democratic primary, saying he was “willing to stand up to corporate polluters.”

The endorsement came after the Hochul Administration approved a controversial gas pipeline in New York Harbor favored by the Trump Administration.

“It’s very obvious that the kind of play nice, insider politics has gotten the climate movement nothing with this governor,” said Alex Beauchamp, the northeast region director of Food and Water Watch. “It doesn’t mean it can always get you nothing, but it certainly has with her. We’ve seen what happens when you sort of trust that they’ll do the right thing. That is not going to work. She is going to have to feel unrelenting pressure. And that’s what we’re trying to do over the next few months.”

The group has a history of making things uncomfortable for governors.

In its campaign to get Gov. Andrew Cuomo to ban hydraulic fracking more than a decade ago, Food and Water Watch had supporters pepper his office with phone calls in what became known as “Call Cuomo Mondays.” The governor agreed to the ban in December 2014, after a strong showing in the Democratic primary by anti-fracking candidate and Fordham Law professor Zephyr Teachout.

Through a spokesman, Hochul said the decision on the all-electric buildings law was meant to ensure it survives legal challenges.

""The Governor remains committed to the all-electric-buildings law and believes this action will help the State defend it, as well as reduce regulatory uncertainty for developers during this period of litigation,” spokesman Ken Lovett said. “Governor Hochul remains resolved to providing more affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy for New Yorkers.""

And the governor, in an interview with the USA TODAY Network in June, said she remains committed to the goals laid out in the Climate Law and Community Protection Act of 2018, which include adding renewables like solar and wind power to the grid and reducing carbon emissions.

But, she noted, surging gas prices, inflation, supply chain disruptions and a Trump Administration hostile to climate initiatives means the state could be facing headwinds over the next four years.

“So I need all the champions of this (climate) law,” Hochul said. “They need to understand that my heart and my vision is to take us to that place to protect our environment and our climate for the future, but I also can’t turn my back on what we need to do now.”

Climate challenges piling up

Hochul frequently invokes affordability to defend decisions unwelcomed by climate advocates. She delayed the start of congestion pricing, a plan to reduce the number of cars entering New York City at 60th Street and below, until the toll was reduced to $9.

It’s a stance that resonates at a time when more than 1 million state ratepayers are behind at least two months on gas and electric bills that are coming in two and three times larger than they’ve been in prior years. Grassroots movements in Rochester and the Hudson Valley are calling for the elimination of privately-run utilities.

But green energy advocates say now’s not the time to shy away from the challenges but to build on the progress already made. They say the transition to a greener economy will make the state less dependent on natural gas solutions and bring prices down. “We need to see a shift in direction from the governor in this coming year,” said Liz Moran, Earthjustice’s New York Policy Advocate.

In the meantime, the obstacles standing in the way of that transition continue to pile up.

The downstate electric grid is now nearly totally reliant on natural gas since the shutdown of the Indian Point nuclear power plant in 2021. A sluggish buildout of renewable energy upstate has the state rethinking climate goals of 70% reliance on renewable sources of power — wind, solar and hydro — by 2030. A state energy plan delivered this week says natural gas and nuclear power will need to stick around for at least the next 15 years to help the state achieve its energy needs.

And the New York Power Authority this month scaled back its outlook for adding more renewables to its portfolio, citing reductions in federal tax credits that have hurt developers.

What ending the 100‑foot gas rule could save ratepayers

The governor’s next test comes this week when she faces a Dec. 19 deadline to sign or veto a bill passed by the state Legislature this year repealing the so-called 100-foot rule. The rule requires utilities to provide gas service to customers who ask for it with the tab picked up by all ratepayers.

Advocate groups peg the annual cost to ratepayers at nearly $600 million.

“This is an outdated mandate that every New Yorker sees on their utility bills that requires them to pay for the expansion of gas pipeline and it comes at a heavy cost,” Moran said.

Republicans aren't buying it

Republicans who’ve been railing against the all-electric bill were not about to heap praise on the governor for delaying what they’ve termed the “gas stove ban.” They viewed her move as a short-term maneuver to deflect conflict over the measure until after the November 2026 election.

“This is a cynical political 'pause' so she can screw New Yorkers with higher prices after the election,” said Rep. Elise Stefanik, a Republican who’s running for governor. “New York needs a full repeal and only a full repeal of the gas stove ban. Not this desperate pause to try to resuscitate her abysmal polling numbers.”

The idea is fairly unpopular with New Yorkers. In a Siena College poll taken in February 2023 when lawmakers were weighing the proposal, some 39% of surveyed voters supported the idea, while 53% opposed it.

The move was welcomed by upstate business leaders.

And in October, several upstate Democrats asked Hochul to hold off on enforcing the law. “A pause is not a rejection of decarbonization goals,” Assemblyman William Conrad, who represents a district in Western New York, wrote. “It is a prudent measure to ensure we do not jeopardize system reliability, impose runaway costs, or force unintended consequences on citizens and businesses.”

Beauchamp believes a backslide on the all-electric law could resonate not only with green energy supporters but voters watching to see if Hochul will stand up to President Trump.

And he said it may not be too late for her to reconsider. He recalls how Cuomo pivoted and embraced a ban on fracking, a process that unleashes natural gas from shale formations using a mix of chemicals water and sand.

“I don’t think Gov. Hochul’s views are all that concrete,” Beauchamp said. “Certainly, on climate issues we’ve kind of seen her waffle both directions. When she feels enough pressure, when she gets that this is a problem for her, she’s certainly been willing to change in the past. So you’d rather have someone who’s with you all the time but I do think that if we have a big enough showing perhaps we can win her back. But we’ll see.”

If the bill stalls, Murphy’s 2035 target would remain in place only as an executive order—something a future governor could water down or revoke.","In the final weeks of Gov. Phil Murphy’s tenure, New Jersey climate advocates are trying to do something governors rarely manage on their way out the door: bind their successors to an ambitious climate promise.

A sweeping measure, known as the New Jersey Clean Energy Act of 2024, would write into law Murphy’s goal of running the state on 100 percent clean electricity by 2035, a target he first set by executive order in 2023.

If it passes before the lame-duck session ends in January, the bill would outlast Murphy and would land on the desk of Governor-elect Mikie Sherrill, who campaigned on lowering utility bills but has not said whether she backs locking the 2035 deadline into statute.

“This is a priority piece of legislation … to codify Governor Murphy’s Executive Order 315, which is the 100 percent clean electricity by 2035 into law,” said Ed Potosnak, executive director of the New Jersey League of Conservation Voters, an environmental advocacy group. “So that the next governor … and beyond, are required to move the state in that direction.”

The bill would strengthen a clean-electricity standard, requiring all power sold in New Jersey to come from clean sources by 2035. This largely mirrors Murphy’s Executive Order 315 and the state’s newly updated Energy Master Plan. It then directs the Board of Public Utilities to create a new market for “clean electricity certificates,” giving utilities and large buyers a tradable way to prove their supply meets the standard.

Starting in 2030, at least half of the renewable energy certificates used for compliance would have to come from projects inside New Jersey, steering more investment and jobs in-state instead of paying for credits from out-of-state wind and solar.

At the same time, the bill tightens New Jersey’s existing renewable standard, which is a separate rule that governs how much electricity must come from specific renewable sources like solar, wind and small hydropower.

While the broader clean-electricity goal would require a carbon-free grid by 2035, the renewable standard would keep ramping up beyond that: Utilities would have to raise the share of their retail sales coming from so-called Class I renewables, such as solar and wind, to 100 percent by 2045, up from a current requirement of 50 percent by 2030.

There is also a nod to political reality. For the small number of fossil-fuel peaker plants that fire up only on days of high demand, the bill gives an extra decade, until 2045, to fully transition to clean power.

New Jersey’s grid is still dominated by fossil fuels and nuclear power. In 2023, natural gas provided about 49 percent of the state’s electricity, while nuclear plants supplied 42 percent. Solar, wind and other renewables made up only a small share of the mix. Together, gas and nuclear have accounted for more than 90 percent of the state’s generation every year since 2011.

Defining Clean Energy

What makes the measure stand out nationally is not just the date, but the way it defines “clean.”

“It would specifically call out co-pollutants as not allowable … anywhere along the supply chain of energy production,” Potosnak said, noting that, if the bill is passed, New Jersey would have among the strictest definitions of clean energy in the United States.

In practice, it would mean that New Jersey’s long-controversial trash incinerators, currently counted as Class II renewables—with trash incineration producing soot and steam to create electricity—could no longer be used to meet the 100 percent clean-energy mandate.

Assemblywoman Verlina Reynolds-Jackson, a Democrat from Trenton and a co-sponsor of the bill, said the definition is especially important for neighborhoods that already host multiple polluting facilities.

“In the city of Trenton … there is a community that has [a] trash incinerator already there,” she recalled, describing how residents pushed back when companies proposed adding still more industrial infrastructure.

The 2018 Clean Energy Act already required utilities to get half their power from Class I renewables by 2030. The new bill would tighten that trajectory, one that counts nuclear and certain zero-carbon resources toward the 2035 goal but forces the remaining fossil-fuel “residual” to shrink steadily.

Climate and health experts say that shift is urgent in a dense state with some of the worst air quality in the country.

Brian Lestini, a physician and public-health advocate with Clinicians for Climate Action, noted that New Jersey’s average temperatures are rising faster than much of the country, compounding risks from extreme heat and air pollution in urban areas with less tree cover.

“Clean renewable energy like solar and wind, they’re the fastest, the cheapest, and also by far the healthiest to build,” Lestini said, arguing that high bills today reflect a lack, not a surplus, of clean energy.

New Energy Plan, New Headwinds

The lame-duck debate comes as Murphy belatedly released the 2024 Energy Master Plan, the state’s long-term roadmap for meeting his clean-energy goals.

The plan assumes New Jersey can still reach 100 percent clean electricity for its average daily load by 2035, even after the collapse of two massive offshore wind projects, Ocean Wind 1 and 2, that were once central to the state’s strategy. Those projects were canceled in late 2023 amid supply-chain delays and rising interest rates; Ørsted, their Danish developer, later agreed to pay New Jersey $125 million to settle related claims.

Instead, the blueprint leans heavily on solar and battery storage, much of it built on already paved land such as warehouses, parking lots and highway medians.

All of that is unfolding against a turbulent national backdrop. President Donald Trump has effectively frozen approvals for major wind and solar projects on federal lands, while openly attacking offshore wind and praising states that scale it back. State officials and advocates warn that federal hostility creates urgency for New Jersey to do what it can on its own.

The state is also grappling with surging electricity demand from new data centers across the PJM regional grid that serves New Jersey and a dozen other states.

“Most people don’t understand what a data center looks like. They don’t know about what a power grid is,” Reynolds-Jackson said. “But they do know that their utility bills are going up … It may be the difference between putting food on the table or buying medicine.”

In Reynolds-Jackson’s view, the surest way to hold down costs and protect communities from pollution is simple: build more clean energy, and don’t stop.

Can Sherrill Make It Work?

If the Legislature sends the bill to the governor’s desk before Jan. 19, Murphy can still sign it. After that, implementing it would fall largely to Sherrill, who has promised to declare a state of emergency on utility rates in her first year in office.

During the campaign, Sherrill ran on an “all-of-the-above” approach to energy that emphasized affordability and grid reliability but stopped short of endorsing Murphy’s 2035 clean-electricity target.

Advocates say that is not unusual.

“Typically … governors don’t weigh in on legislation. They let the legislative branch do their thing until it gets pretty far along,” Potosnak said.

State Sen. Andrew Zwicker, a Democrat and one of Trenton’s leading clean-energy voices who sponsored the 2035 goal bill, said the biggest challenge for the bill now was timing.

“There is very little time left to reach the floor before the end of the lame-duck session,” Zwicker said. “If it doesn’t make it, it gets reintroduced. We’d push again with the Sherrill administration.”

Potosnak is more determined. The lame duck session, he said, is “a time when really good things can happen quickly,” and he believes voters just gave lawmakers a mandate to act.

“This election has shown that voters want affordable energy and clean energy is the cheapest,” he said, referring to Sherrill’s victory.

If the bill stalls, Murphy’s 2035 target would remain in place only as an executive order—something a future governor could water down or revoke.

“The more important thing than the accountability part towards the government is the signaling to investors,” Mr. Potosnak said. Without clear law, he warned, “they get cold feet and they just stay out … They want predictability. They want reliability.”

Lestini, the physician, comes back to the human bottom line.

“There is a false narrative … that’s basically blaming what we’re seeing in terms of rates on renewable energy,” he said. In reality, he added, the lack of clean supply has left families choosing between “paying their energy bill or buying medications,” a choice he believes no one should have to make.",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2244083081.jpg,N,,2025-12-20 09:57:59.418107

That delivery includes nuclear energy, joining coal and natural gas as cornerstones of the nation’s future energy mix.
“This is about meeting real energy demand with real projects,” Governor Gordon said.
As a part of this legislation, the legislature specifically defined large projects as “any qualifying energy project for which the state's participation is at least fifty million dollars ($50,000,000.00)”.
Governor Gordon also thanked the Wyoming Legislature for granting the authority to deploy Large Project Energy Matching Funds and Energy Matching Funds (EMF) for recognizing the importance of strategic investment.","Cheyenne, Wyo. - Governor Mark Gordon (R-WY) and the Wyoming Energy Authority (WEA) announced today the award of $100 million in Large Project Energy Matching Funds (LPEMF) to BWXT, supporting an energy project that advances Wyoming’s economy and uranium industry and President Trump’s agenda to strengthen American energy independence by increasing the growing demand for advanced nuclear fuel.

This investment aligns with President Trump’s energy dominance strategy, which recognizes that America’s economic strength, national security, and technological leadership depend on the delivery of reliable, affordable, and dispatchable energy. That delivery includes nuclear energy, joining coal and natural gas as cornerstones of the nation’s future energy mix.

“This is about meeting real energy demand with real projects,” Governor Gordon said. “Energy Matching Funds are not about government picking winners; they are about responding to market signals and investing where private capital, innovation, and demand are already moving.”

During a recent tour of Idaho National Laboratory, U.S. Energy Secretary Wright described the BWXT project as an example of a “nuclear renaissance,” saying “You know, we're at the early age of a nuclear renaissance where we’re talking about all these reactors being built. They're going to run on fuel. Wyoming's been a tremendous energy state, across the spectrum. I would add nuclear fuel to that if I was Wyoming. And I love the great town of Gillette.""

This renaissance is seen in growing public and private-sector investments, improving advanced reactor technology, and rising demand for uranium. Senator John Barrasso’s “Prohibiting Uranium Imports Act of 2024” banned the import of Russian fuel and highlighted Wyoming's dominance in uranium deposits as the state is projected to hold 54% of the market share. The net impact of this uranium production to the Wyoming economy is projected to be approximately $63M in annual GSP.

This project builds on that anticipated production by adding fuel fabrication to Wyoming’s front end fuel cycle supply chain. When completed, this project will bring with it over 200 direct jobs when it reaches full operation with an estimated annual payroll of over $20 million.

In addition, economic modeling shows an additional 194 indirect and induced jobs with new payrolls exceeding $20 million annually. Property taxes on the facilities will also be paid annually and on average over the first ten years of operation, the facility is expected to contribute approximately $100 million in Gross State Product annually.

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) license required for this facility is a 40 year license. The NRC also grants extensions of these licenses with several facilities now having operated for nearly 70 years. We anticipate this facility to be a multi-decadal facility.

“Today is a powerful day for Gillette and for the future of Wyoming,” Gillette Mayor Shay Lundvall said. “Governor Gordon’s decision to award BWXT significant matching funds is a clear vote of confidence in our people, our community, and our role in America’s energy and technology future. Gillette has always powered this nation, and now we are expanding that legacy. I want to thank Governor Gordon for his vision and leadership, and BWXT for believing in Gillette. This partnership represents momentum, opportunity, and pride and it reinforces that the best days for Gillette and Wyoming are still ahead.”

“This investment by the state of Wyoming supports BWXT’s goal to commercialize TRISO fuel for advanced nuclear reactors,” said Joe Miller, BWXT president of Government Operations. “We want to thank Governor Gordon, Rob Creager and the Wyoming Energy Authority and the people of Campbell County and Gillette who have been so supportive of this project, including the county commissioners and Mayor Lundvall. Together we can help build a stronger future for Wyoming and America.”

Governor Gordon’s decision to invest in BWXT helps advance that national momentum and national security as this facility, when completed, will be the first nuclear fuel fabrication site built in the US in decades and will reduce America’s reliance on foreign fuel.

“A TRISO fuel fabrication plant in Gillette strengthens Wyoming's role in national energy security, supports a reliable and secure fuel supply for advanced reactors, and keeps the United States at the forefront of nuclear innovation. Over the last decades, foreign countries have been controlling the front end of the nuclear fuel cycle, and this project supports President Trump and Secretary Wright’s goals for American energy independence and dominance,” says Rob Creager, Executive Director of the Wyoming Energy Authority. “BWXT choosing Wyoming means new jobs, new investment in the state, and a chance for our workforce to help continue to lead the country in reliable baseload energy.”

The funds being used in this project were appropriated by the Wyoming legislature specifically for large energy projects in 2024. As a part of this legislation, the legislature specifically defined large projects as “any qualifying energy project for which the state's participation is at least fifty million dollars ($50,000,000.00)”. The legislation also requires a minimum, 1:1 match for any project. This proposed project is expected to go above and beyond that requirement with BWXT potentially investing more than $400 million for a fully operational and scaled facility.

Wyoming is uniquely positioned to lead this next chapter. Uranium was recently designated as a critical mineral by the United States Geological Survey and is a priority mineral for the state, alongside coal, trona, and bentonite. Wyoming has mined uranium since the 1950s and is home to the country’s largest known reserves, and today’s renewed interest in nuclear energy is creating a value-added supply chain rooted right here at home. Five of the nation’s top uranium-producing mines are located within a 70-mile radius of Gillette, making northeast Wyoming a powerhouse for advanced energy development.

Under President Trump and Governor Gordon’s leadership, Wyoming will continue to embrace and expand this emerging energy ecosystem.

Governor Gordon also thanked the Wyoming Legislature for granting the authority to deploy Large Project Energy Matching Funds and Energy Matching Funds (EMF) for recognizing the importance of strategic investment. Gillette and the Wyoming energy industry are also set to benefit under the EMF. Recently, the Governor approved the use of EMF to assist Basin Electric conduct a front end engineering design study to build a second coal fired unit at the Dry Fork Power Plant.

This forward looking program has kept Wyoming at the forefront and competitive with states like Texas, Tennessee, and many others that are vying for this investment in their states. “A former Legislature made a smart, forward-looking, say-yes-to-Wyoming decision,” Gordon said. “States across the country are competing for these projects every day. Wyoming is in that competition, and it’s one we intend to win.”",https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/wyomingnewsnow.tv/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/b/38/b3866490-87fe-4793-a864-d1942db122ce/6945c7f8e6168.preview.png?crop=376%2C376%2C74%2C0&resize=200%2C200&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-12-20 12:00:03.222189

“If this plan goes through as proposed, it will devastate hundreds of family farms and wipe out more than a century of agricultural tradition in Potter Valley,” said Secretary Rollins. “Water is the lifeblood of farming. Without it, crops fail, businesses close, and rural communities crumble. For generations, farmers here have put this water to good, productive use. But under California’s radical leadership, the needs of hardworking families are being ignored while the needs of fish are treated as more important. That’s simply wrong. This plan would put countless USDA investments at risk and leave families even more vulnerable to drought and wildfire. This is why I’m intervening in the FERC proceedings and urging them to reject the pending application.”

Secretary Rollins also filed comments urging the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to reject Pacific Gas and Electric’s (PG&E) current application to surrender its FERC license for Potter Valley Project Hydroelectric Project. Secretary Rollins’ comments urge FERC to reject PG&E’s application unless significant deficiencies are addressed.

Background:

The Department has serious concerns with Pacific Gas and Electric’s (PG&E) current application to surrender its FERC license for Potter Valley Project Hydroelectric Project because of the profoundly negative and irreversible impact on local farmers, ranchers, agricultural producers, communities, and USDA equities. USDA maintains a large number of programs across different mission areas that will be negatively impacted; namely, the National Forest System (NFS), the Risk Management Agency, the Farm Service Agency (FSA), Rural Development, and the Natural Resources and Conservation Service (NRCS).

For perspective, according to the last census of agriculture the counties of Lake, Mendocino, Sonoma, Humboldt, and Marin have a combined total of over $1.4 billion in sales of agricultural products. That's well over $4.2 billion in extra economic activity due to agriculture if you assume a standard multiplier of $3 to $1 which is standard in the nearby Central Valley.

Recently the Secretary received a letter (PDF, 1.9 MB) from over 920 residents with grave concerns about the proposed surrender and decommissioning plan for the Potter Valley Hydroelectric Project.

The Secretary also penned an op-ed, highlighting concerns.

Solar For All first started in 2022 under the Biden administration, funded by the Inflation Reduction Act: new environmental laws that would help fight against climate change. In August of 2024, Solar For All had provided monetary grants for 60 recipients including 49 states, six tribes, and the U.S. territories.

The program also helps to cut the costs of the electricity bill, up to 20 percent for over 900,000 homes.

“I think cost is a big factor into why we can or cannot be environmentally friendly. Sometimes you don’t have a choice,” said Amisha Shankar ’26.

Programs like Solar For All are also seen as a good way to remind people to be more aware of their ecological footprint, and to be more environmentally friendly.

“Solar panels are very expensive, and so by having these free forms of energy people are more willing to use it,” added Shankar.

Many in the United States have been affected by the cancellation of the program, such as the southern states. In Texas, Harris County was granted $249 million to help distribute solar and battery power to in-need neighborhoods. This grant provided workforce training for low-income workers and minorities.

The move to cut the program by the EPA was ultimately made by the Trump Administration, as they decided to cut back on federal support for solar and wind energy.

“If we cut programs like this, we’re going to use energy in ways that we’ve always had, which is not sustainable,” said Environmental Science teacher Michael O’Brien.

As renewable energy becomes more common, decisions like these may make it harder for people in the United States to become more eco-friendly, and would ultimately contribute to global warming and climate change as a whole.",https://rcrusadernews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_0392-e1765946707499.jpeg,N,,2025-12-20 05:59:03.979808

Wrapping Up The 1,700 job cuts at GM’s Fairfax Assembly are a stark reminder that the EV revolution is not a guaranteed, smooth transition.","The road to an all-electric future was never going to be a straight line, but recent bumps have felt more like tank traps for legacy automakers. The latest shockwave comes from General Motors, with reports confirming plans to cut approximately 1,700 jobs at its Fairfax Assembly plant in Kansas. This move, tied directly to adjusting production schedules for the Chevrolet Bolt EV and other models, is a stark illustration of the friction between aggressive EV ambitions and the cold reality of current market demand.

While the human cost to the workforce is the most immediate and painful aspect of this news, the strategic implications ripple far beyond Kansas City. This isn't just a local retooling hiccup; it's a significant indicator of a broader industry recalibration that is forcing Detroit's giants to tap the brakes on their electric dreams.

The Fairfax Shakeup: Why is This Happening Now?

On the surface, the job cuts at Fairfax are a mechanistic result of product lifecycles. The plant is ceasing production of the current Chevrolet Bolt EV and EUV, which have been modest successes but are built on older battery architecture. GM is also winding down production of the gasoline-powered Cadillac XT4 at the facility. The primary goal is to retool the plant for the next-generation Bolt, which will be built on GM’s advanced Ultium platform, and to prepare for future Cadillac models.

However, the depth of the cuts—affecting roughly two-thirds of the plant's workforce, according to reports from sources like Automotive News—signals more than just a routine model changeover. It reflects a necessary, albeit painful, pause. The gap between the end of the current Bolt and the start of the next-gen EV is a chasm GM must bridge. Furthermore, softer-than-anticipated demand for existing models has likely exacerbated the need for such drastic staffing adjustments during the transition period.

The Long View: A Strategic Retreat or a Necessary Pivot?

For GM, this move represents a critical pivot from an ""all-in at all costs"" mentality to a more pragmatic, profitability-focused approach. CEO Mary Barra has made it clear that while the destination remains an all-electric future, the path to get there must be economically viable.

Long term, this is likely a smart, if painful, play. By biting the bullet now to retool for the Ultium-based Bolt, GM is investing in a future where it can produce profitable, affordable EVs at scale. The current Bolt was a great proof of concept, but it was never going to be the high-margin, mass-market vehicle GM needs to sustain its business. The Fairfax transition is the physical manifestation of GM's strategy to move from EV novelty to EV profitability. However, it also carries a significant risk: GM is effectively leaving the affordable EV segment vacant until the new Bolt arrives, a gap competitors will be eager to exploit.

The Detroit Narrative: GM Isn’t Alone in Tapping the Brakes

It is crucial to view GM’s actions within the broader context of the American automotive industry. GM is not an outlier; it is part of a clear trend. Its cross-town rival, Ford, has made similar strategic adjustments in recent months.

Facing slower-than-expected adoption rates, Ford has cut production shifts for the F-150 Lightning, its flagship electric truck. Furthermore, Ford has delayed some of its massive battery plant investments and has openly stated it will lean more heavily into hybrid vehicles as a ""bridge"" technology for consumers not yet ready to go fully electric.

Both GM and Ford are responding to the same market signals: high interest rates, charging infrastructure anxiety, and vehicle prices remain significant barriers to mass EV adoption. The initial wave of early adopters has bought their EVs; the next phase of converting the mainstream buyer is proving far more difficult and slower than Detroit’s optimistic projections suggested.

The Global Stage: What This Means for US EV Competitiveness

The optics of GM’s retreat, however temporary, are challenging on the global stage. As US legacy automakers tap the brakes, international competitors are accelerating.

Tesla, despite its own recent stock market fluctuations and price cuts, continues to dominate the US EV market and is aggressively expanding its global footprint with its new plant in Mexico. More menacingly, Chinese automakers like BYD are growing at an astonishing pace, producing high-quality, affordable EVs at a scale that Detroit is currently struggling to match.

The Fairfax situation highlights a critical vulnerability for GM and the US auto industry: the difficulty of transitioning century-old manufacturing behemoths versus the agility of newer, EV-first companies. While GM recalibrates its factories and supply chains, it risks losing valuable market momentum and mindshare. The longer it takes for GM to get its affordable Ultium-based vehicles on the road, the wider the door opens for Tesla to consolidate its lead and for Chinese manufacturers to potentially gain a foothold in North America.

Wrapping Up

The 1,700 job cuts at GM’s Fairfax Assembly are a stark reminder that the EV revolution is not a guaranteed, smooth transition. It is a complex, capital-intensive industrial pivot fraught with market uncertainties. For GM, this is a painful but likely necessary step to align its production reality with current demand while preparing for a more profitable electric future. But in the hyper-competitive global EV landscape, time is a luxury Detroit does not have. The success of this strategic pause depends entirely on how quickly and effectively GM can complete the Fairfax retooling and deliver the next-generation Bolt to a market hungry for affordable electric options.",https://www.torquenews.com/profiles/torquenews/themes/tn/favicon.gif,N,,2025-12-20 11:59:58.831228

The Christmas season is upon us, a time of year when many of us reflect on the year that is drawing to a close and on the good times, the sad times, and the challenges ahead. It’s also a time of year when we count our blessings and express gratitude for any good things that have come our way.

While some may realize it more than others, all Americans should be grateful for one thing most of us tend to take for granted – light that appears in the rooms of our homes at the flick of a switch, heat that emanates through our floorboard vents or radiators by merely increasing the number on a dial or a digital pad, cars, SUVs and trucks that start with the turn of a key or the push of a button.

All these modern conveniences are made possible for even low-income Americans thanks to energy that is affordable and widely accessible.

In this increasingly diverse and often divided society in which we live, all Americans are united by access to low-cost, effective energy. We have been blessed for so long by affordable energy that we are sometimes in danger of taking it for granted.

But without the change in presidential administrations that happened last January – and with it the blessings of lowered inflation, a return to free-market principles and, especially, regulatory rollbacks (more on that shortly) – Americans could have been facing a much bleaker winter this Christmas season.

Under the Biden administration, inflation averaged nearly 5%, “hitting 9.1% during the worst inflation crisis in decades,” the White House recently pointed out. In the new Trump administration, inflation has dropped to an average of 2.7%, and “Americans have seen the first overall price decline since 2020.”

Even more impressively, the skyrocketing gas prices experienced under the Biden regime have thankfully been dramatically reversed. Americans “now see the lowest average gas price in more than four years and are on track to spend the lowest amount of their disposable income on gas in the last two decades.”

While energy costs remain relatively low compared to other rising costs, the Trump administration is working to tame electricity prices which began climbing in 2022 under the Biden administration.

One analysis showed that “from March 2022 to June 2025, average monthly energy bills rose from $196 to $265 – a 35 percent jump, or nearly three times overall inflation during that period.” Trump’s reversal of Biden subsidies and incentives that artificially propped up “alternatives” like wind and solar will begin to reap dividends in the coming months and years. The new administration’s fast-track permitting process for new exploration will supercharge our most abundant and reliable legacy resources, driving energy costs down.

But while politicians and pundits seem focused on “prices” as a measure of “affordability,” the long list of regulatory rollbacks in which the Trump administration has engaged will be the real catalyst leading to a more affordable life in the U.S.

Trump’s deregulatory efforts “are saving Americans a collective $180 billion — or $2,100 per family of four,” the White House notes. “For example, President Trump halted burdensome Biden-era efficiency standards that jacked up the price of everyday appliances.”

Earlier this month, in an announcement that did not get the attention it deserved, President Trump unveiled relaxed fuel economy standards “for the more than 15 million new cars and trucks sold in the country every year,” as the Detroit News reported.

“The plan, if finalized, would slash fuel economy requirements through the 2031 model year, to about a fleetwide average for light-duty vehicles of roughly 34.5 miles per gallon, down from roughly 50 miles per gallon under the current rules,” the story noted.

Administration officials rightfully said that “the new standards would increase consumers’ access to a wider range of affordable gas-powered vehicles and help hold down new car prices.”

“Today’s a victory of common sense and affordability,” said Jim Farley, CEO of Ford Motor Company, who joined Trump at that Oval Office announcement. It was great news for everyone who loves their dependable gas-powered cars, SUVs and trucks.

It’s impossible to overstate the scope of the catastrophe that has been averted by dismantling the disastrous energy policies of the previous administration. If the Biden-era subsidies, mandates and penalties had continued, Americans would likely be facing a much bleaker holiday season, not to mention the cold-weather months that follow for much of the country.

The gift of energy policies that promote affordability, accessibility and commonsense emission standards should be high on the wish list of every American family.

While this Christmas may be too soon upon us to expect delivery of such a present, passage of the Affordable, Reliable, Clean Energy Security act (ARC-ES) introduced in October by Rep. Troy Balderson (R-OH) would make the perfect gift from Congress and President Trump to all 340 million Americans in conjunction with America’s 250th birthday on July 4, 2026.

ARC-ES would codify low-cost, accessible energy into law, protecting energy security from the radical political whims of future far-left administrations. In this season of hope, wishing for such a gift in the next six months should not require a Christmas miracle – merely the will of our elected representatives in Washington to do the right thing.

“May your days be merry and bright,” Bing Crosby sings in “White Christmas” – merry because of the holiday, bright thanks to low-cost energy that is there when we need it. Merry Christmas and Happy New Year.",https://assets.realclear.com/images/70/705159_6_.jpeg,N,,2025-12-20 10:59:39.409944

Reporting Texas

With America facing mounting pressure to reduce its dependence on foreign rare earth minerals, Texas and the University of Texas are seeking a role in rebuilding a domestic supply chain.

The University of Texas at Austin has held two educational forums in the past five months, seeking a role in driving innovation and dialogue around critical mineral development.

“The central question is, how can we stimulate our own supply of these critical minerals?” JR DeShazo, dean of the LBJ School of Public Affairs, said at one of the forums.

Participants in the events said efforts to build American capacity are vital; the United States currently relies on foreign stockpiles for 12 of the 15 critical rare earth minerals required for technologies such as electric vehicle batteries and smartphones. While trade agreements exist with these countries, the U.S. does not want to depend on them.

The first event was hosted by the Jackson School of Geosciences over Aug. 13–15, followed by another on Nov. 17 at the LBJ School of Public Affairs. Both explored policy, research and technological developments at the forefront of the U.S. critical mineral race and came on the heels of research by UT science teams into developing more environmentally friendly methods of extracting rare earth minerals.

“A few years ago the critical minerals vulnerability of the U.S. was a theoretical exercise; we have seen how this is no longer a theoretical exercise,” said Jose Fernandez, who served as undersecretary of state during the Biden administration.

China poses a significant hurdle in America’s efforts to escape mineral dependence. Despite political and ideological differences — not to mention an ongoing trade war — the U.S. is still dependent on China for many essential rare earth minerals. Experts say that trade agreements and tariff pressure on other nations are unreliable long-term solutions and that the U.S. must develop its own methods for extracting critical rare earth minerals.

China has worked to become resource independent over the past decade. But its example has also become a cautionary tale..

“A reason why the People’s Republic of China has succeeded in rare earth mining and minerals is because they devastated the countryside. There has been an environmental cost,” Fernandez said

“Whether it is dredge mining, deep-sea mining or space mining, we have to do things responsibly,” said Tem Tumurbat, co-founder and managing partner of Nomadic Venture Partners .

The demand for critical minerals in the U.S. is skyrocketing. This demand is fueled by nationwide infrastructure expansions, green energy transitions and national security concerns. A huge demand is also coming from data centers.

The United States does have plenty of treasures underground and until the 1990s the U.S. was the world’s leading producer of rare earth minerals. Since that time, America has cut back on mining and processing.

Only 10 percent of the nation’s rare earth mineral and element supply now comes from domestic extraction, while roughly 78 percent of the supply comes from China. The U.S. has only four operational aluminum smelting plants, two copper refineries and only one aluminum refinery. Most minerals extracted domestically are still shipped overseas for processing before returning to the U.S. supply chain.

Rare earth minerals such as yttrium, samarium and neodymium are essential for the nation’s defense system including the F-35 fighter jets thermal barrier coatings, radar systems, visual displays and turbine blades. These are among the rare earth minerals that China has previously restricted exportation of, along with gallium, which the U.S. depends on China for nearly its entire supply.

Societal and environmental challenges pose significant hurdles to critical mineral mining, experts say.

“No one wants a copper mine in their neighborhood,” said Douglas Wicks, a program director at the Advanced Research Projects Agency–Energy.

But those minerals are increasingly important, he added.

“Minerals will be a driver for the green transition that is focused on reducing fossil fuels,” Wicks said.

Finding practical solutions amid growing industrial needs is becoming especially urgent in the Lone Star State. UT-Austin’s focus on the topic of rare earth minerals comes at a crucial time for the state, which has emerged as a hub for large-scale semiconductor and chip manufacturing by companies like Samsung, Texas Instruments, Infineon, GlobalWafers, NXP, X-FAB and Applied Materials.

Texas is home to 411 data centers, the second most nationwide, and a new $40 billion investment from Google will fund the construction of three more.

Semiconductor and chip manufacturing rely on such critical minerals as gallium and germanium. Both have seen exportation restrictions from China in past years. By 2030, the projected U.S. AI data center mineral demand is estimated to be 450,000 tons of copper, 175,000 tons of aluminum, 12,500 tons of nickel, 10,000 tons of graphite and 65 tons of gallium.

“The United States cannot actually succeed in the age of AI as a force to be reckoned with without having access to critical ingredients and imports that power our batteries, our devices, EVs, advanced defense equipment and chips,” said Dilawar Syed, an economic policy adviser and associate professor at the LBJ School.

The UT conferences have also focused on the promise of drawing resources from mineral waste. “We need recycling of critical minerals,” Fernandez said.

Currently, in the United States, it takes on average 15–30 years to open a new mining operation, from the idea and location to the start of the extraction.

“In the U.S. to meet demand, we would have to open at least 300 new mines in the next few years,” Tumurbat said.

By contrast, Tumurbat said, the time it takes to obtain permits to begin extracting the waste can be a span of months to a year. But many companies today have mountains of waste sitting on their balance sheets and want to offload them..

“There are billions of tons of material that have been mined historically that have incredible amounts of value, and we just need to develop technology to be able to process them,” Tumurbat said.

The two UT events also looked at a second approach to obtaining critical minerals: deep sea mining.

“It feels like we are at the beginning of a gold rush,” said Anna Scott, the CEO of Mithril Minerals, a Texas-based deep sea mining company “I have always wondered what a gold rush felt like, and I think I know now,” she said.

Deep sea mining involves sending mineral-extracting rovers to the bottom of the seafloor and siphoning up rocks that contain rare earth minerals.

These rocks have generated excitement, because research suggests there is a bountiful supply sitting at the bottom of the ocean. While there are many rare earth minerals the U.S. is in need of obtaining within these rocks, there are serious ecological concerns with getting them out of the sea.

These rocks can contain both light earth elements and heavy rare earth elements such as cerium, yttrium, europium and cobalt, and Scott said they are accessible.

“With any mining and mineral play there are, of course, consequences to this. One of the big consequences is, of course, the ecological consequences,” .

While companies such as Scott’s are trying to come up with ways of extracting these minerals that cause less harm, the unknowns are still troubling, Fernandez said.

“To be honest, no one really knows what the environmental damage will be,” he said.

On April 24, President Donald Trump signed the executive order titled Unleashing America’s Offshore Critical Minerals and Resources. The order aims to accelerate permits given to domestic companies to begin exploration and collection of deep sea minerals.

The order cites “unprecedented economic and national security challenges in securing reliable supplies of critical minerals independent of foreign adversary control.”

A team of researchers from UT is working to address the environmental impact of mineral extraction. The group includes experts from the departments of civil, architectural and environmental engineering; chemical engineering; and chemistry. They have created a mineral extraction method some experts are calling a breakthrough, compared with current industry methods.

Today, rare earth minerals are often extracted through a process called “solvent extraction,”which separates elements from complex ores using chemical solvents. The specific elements desired for extraction will be drawn into a liquid solution. While effective, this process causes substantial chemical and energy waste, as well as pollution.

In contrast, UT researchers’ new separation process involves the use of artificially designed membrane channels that are created to specifically extract certain rare earth ions. These artificial membrane channels replicate how cells naturally move ions therefore allowing only certain minerals to pass through. This mineral extraction technique produces far less waste than current methods, and if successfully applied to commercial use could help lead to a more dependable domestic supply of rare earth minerals. It has yet to be shown whether the transition from laboratory to large-scale business use will be practical or economically feasible, however.

While the experts at the UT events said efforts to secure minerals needed for the nation’s future are a step in the right direction, far more work both at the higher education, state, private sector and federal level is required.

“This is not a problem that will be solved overnight,” Fernandez said.",https://www.reportingtexas.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Main-Photo-with-Caption-Completed.png,N,,2025-12-20 12:00:10.356474

Already, they’ve managed to block or stall tens of billions of dollars’ worth of potential investment in proposed data centers.
“We expect that opposition is going to keep growing,” says Miquel Vila, an analyst at the research firm Data Center Watch who’s been tracking campaigns against data centers across the US since 2023.
Virginia, Maryland, and Minnesota, meanwhile, have introduced legislation attempting to rein in tax incentives for data centers or energy costs for other consumers, the Data Center Watch report says.
They argue that there aren’t enough policies in place to prevent data centers from burdening nearby communities with higher bills and more pollution.","If there’s one thing Republicans and Democrats came together on in 2025 — at least at the local level — it was to stop big, energy-hungry data center projects.

For communities sick of rising electricity bills and pollution from power plants, data centers have become an obvious target. Fights against new data centers surged this year as grassroots groups, voters, and local lawmakers demanded more accountability from developers. Already, they’ve managed to block or stall tens of billions of dollars’ worth of potential investment in proposed data centers. And they’re not letting up.

“We expect that opposition is going to keep growing,” says Miquel Vila, an analyst at the research firm Data Center Watch who’s been tracking campaigns against data centers across the US since 2023.

“We expect that opposition is going to keep growing.”

The group’s latest report found that developers either canceled or delayed 20 projects after facing pushback from locals, representing $98 billion in proposed investments in the second quarter of this year. In fact, from late March through June, $24.2 billion in projects were blocked and $73.7 billion delayed. That’s an increase compared to 16 blocked or postponed projects from 2023 through the first quarter of this year, the group notes.

The number of proposed data center projects has grown, which is a big reason why opposition is also picking up steam. Inventory in the four biggest data center markets in North America — Northern Virginia, Chicago, Atlanta, and Phoenix — grew by 43 percent year-over-year in the first quarter of this year, according to commercial real estate company CBRE. But plans for massive new facilities have also sparked battles across the nation.

Data centers eat up a lot of electricity, particularly for more powerful chips used for new AI models. Power demand for data centers is expected to grow by 22 percent by the end of the year compared to last year. A high-density rack of servers in an AI data center might use as much as 80 to 100 homes’ worth of power, or upward of 100 kilowatts, according to Dan Thompson, a principal research analyst at S&P Global. AI also requires a lot of water to keep servers cool and generate electricity and could use as much annually as the indoor needs of 18.5 million US households by 2028 by one estimate.

Google dropped its plans for a new data center in Franklin Township, Indiana, in September after residents raised concerns about how much water and electricity the new data center would use. The Indianapolis City-County Council was reportedly expected to deny the project’s rezoning application. That victory for residents in Indiana isn’t captured in the Data Center Watch report, which is only updated with information through June.

Other data center projects that are moving forward or already operating still face resistance. Elon Musk’s xAI, for example, faces a potential lawsuit from the NAACP and Southern Environmental Law Center over pollution from its data center in Memphis. Peak nitrogen dioxide concentration levels have jumped by 79 percent in the area surrounding the data center since it started operating in 2024, according to research from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville requested by Time magazine.

xAI, which is building a second, larger data center in Memphis, didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment from The Verge, but says “We’re moving toward a future where we will harness our cluster’s full power to solve intractable problems,” on its website.

“No community should be forced to sacrifice clean air, clean water, or safe homes so that corporations and billionaires can build energy-hungry facilities,” the NAACP said in guiding principles that it shared with The Verge in September for other grassroots groups working to hold data center developers accountable for their impact on nearby neighborhoods.

Meta is facing a backlash against its largest data center yet planned for Richland Parish, Louisiana. Local utility Entergy broke ground this month on two of three gas plants it’s building to meet that facility’s electricity demands, expected to reach triple the amount of power New Orleans uses in a year. “Entergy LA customers are now set to subsidize Meta’s data center costs,” the Union of Concerned Scientists says in a November blog post, including an estimated $3.2 billion for the three gas-fired plants and a new $550 million transmission line. Entergy, on the other hand, contends that “Meta’s electric payments to Entergy will lower what customers pay for resilience upgrades by approximately 10%,” according to communications manager Brandon Scardigli.

“Our agreement with Entergy was structured to ensure that other customers are not paying for our data center energy use,” Meta spokesperson Ashley Settle says in an email to The Verge. Settle adds that Meta is contributing $15 million to Entergy’s ratepayer support program and more than $200 million for local infrastructure improvements.

“Now, we have a bogey man.”

Rising electricity costs became a flashpoint during November elections in the US this year, helping to propel two Democrats to the governor’s offices in New Jersey and Virginia. New Jersey residents have faced one of the steepest rises in power prices of any state in the nation, while Virginia is home to “data center alley,” through which 70 percent of internet traffic passes.

“Now, we have a bogey man — data centers who are these large energy users who are coming in, and in many states, getting sweetheart deals on wholesale electricity prices, when regular consumers don’t have that type of sway,” Tony Reames, a professor of environmental justice at the University of Michigan and former Department of Energy official under President Biden, said to The Verge after the election.

States, both red and blue, are starting to set some limits on those sweetheart deals. After South Dakota lawmakers rejected a bill that would have offered developers sales tax refunds, Applied Digital paused plans for a $16 billion AI campus in the state. Virginia, Maryland, and Minnesota, meanwhile, have introduced legislation attempting to rein in tax incentives for data centers or energy costs for other consumers, the Data Center Watch report says.

Nationally, more than 230 health and environmental groups have called for a moratorium on data center construction. The organizations, led by the nonprofit Food & Water Watch, sent a letter to Congress with their demands in December. They argue that there aren’t enough policies in place to prevent data centers from burdening nearby communities with higher bills and more pollution. President Donald Trump released an “AI Action Plan” in July that aims to speed data center development in part by rolling back environmental regulations.

With midterm elections next year, we’re likely to see more data center fights playing into local politics, Vila expects. “It’s going to be very interesting to track how this opposition impacts the regulatory framework,” he says.",https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/258090_EOY_2025_CVirginia_DATA_CENTER.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C10.732984293194%2C100%2C78.534031413613&w=1200,N,,2025-12-20 05:59:16.701054

It says it needs 10,000 megawatts of new capacity — enough to power 4 million Georgia homes — with 80% of that flowing to data centers.
“It means that maybe they’re not going up as fast.” Existing customers would pay for part of the construction program that doesn't serve data centers.","ATLANTA (AP) — Georgia's only private electric utility plans to increase power capacity by 50% after state regulators on Friday agreed 5-0 that the plan is needed to meet projected demand from data centers.

It would be one of the biggest build-outs in the U.S. to meet the insatiable electricity demand from developers of artificial intelligence. The construction cost would be $16.3 billion, but staff members say customers will pay $50 billion to $60 billion over coming decades, including interest costs and guaranteed profit for the monopoly utility.

Georgia Power Co. and the Public Service Commission pledge large users will more than pay for their costs, and that spreading fixed costs over more customers, could help significantly cut residents' power bills beginning in 2029.

“Large energy users are paying more so families and small businesses can pay less, and that’s a great result for Georgians,” Georgia Power CEO Kim Greene said in a statement after the vote.

But opponents say the five elected Republicans on the commission are greenlighting a risky bet by the utility to chase data center customers with existing ratepayers left holding the bag if demand doesn't materialize.

“The need for 10,000 megawatts of new capacity resources on the system in the next six years isn’t here,"" said Bob Sherrier, a lawyer representing some opponents. “It just isn't, and it may never be.”

The approval came less than two months after voters rebuked GOP leadership, ousting two incumbent Republicans on the commission in favor of Democrats by overwhelming margins. Those two Democrats won in campaigns that centered on six Georgia Power rate increases commissioners have allowed in recent years, even though the company agreed to a three-year rate freeze in July.

Peter Hubbard and Alicia Johnson — the Democrats who will take office Jan. 1 — opposed Friday's vote. But current commissioners refused to delay.

Electric bills have emerged as a potent political issue in Georgia and nationwide, with grassroots opposition to data centers partly based on fears that other customers will subsidize power demands of technology behemoths.

Georgia Power is the largest unit of Atlanta-based Southern Co. It says it needs 10,000 megawatts of new capacity — enough to power 4 million Georgia homes — with 80% of that flowing to data centers. The company has 2.7 million customers today, including homes, businesses and industries.

Whether the company’s projections of a huge increase in demand will pan out has been the central argument. Georgia Power and commission staff agreed Dec. 9 to allow the company to build or acquire all the desired capacity, despite staff earlier saying the company's forecast included too much speculative construction.

In return, the company agreed that after the current rate freeze ends in 2028, it would use revenue from new customers to place “downward pressure” on rates through 2031. That would amount to at least $8.50 a month, or $102 a year, for a typical residential customer. That customer currently pays more than $175 a month, including taxes.

""So we’re taking advantage of the upsides from this additional revenue, but allow it to shift the downside and the risk over to the company. And I’m real proud of that,"" Commission Chairman Jason Shaw said after the vote.

But “downward pressure” doesn't guarantee a rate decrease.

""It doesn’t mean your bills are going down,"" said Liz Coyle, executive director of consumer group Georgia Watch. “It means that maybe they’re not going up as fast.”

Existing customers would pay for part of the construction program that doesn't serve data centers. More importantly, opponents fear Georgia Power's pledge of rate relief can't be enforced, or won't hold up over the 40-plus years needed to pay off new natural-gas fired power plants.

In a Monday news conference, Hubbard likened it to a mortgage “to build a massive addition to your home for a new roommate, big tech.”

""If in 10 years, the AI bubble bursts or the data centers move to a cheaper state, then the roommate moves out, but the mortgage doesn’t go away,” he said.

Staff members say the commission must watch demand closely and that if data centers don't use as much power as projected, Georgia Power must drop agreements to purchase wholesale power, close its least efficient generating plants and seek additional customers.

Many opponents oppose any new generation fueled by natural gas, warning carbon emissions will worsen climate change. Some opponents were escorted out of the commission meeting by police after they began chanting “Nay! Nay! Nay! The people say nay!”

“Increased natural gas output for the sake of these silicon billionaire kings seems like a lose-lose,"" opponent Zak Norton told commissioners Friday.

Rodriguez, Kyle Bradley, James Goodwin, Federico Holm, Liam LaMountain, Sarah Kadous, The Regulatory Review",,,,,https://www.theregreview.org/2025/12/20/seminar-predicting-turbidity-protecting-tap-water/,"Scholars analyze how the use of machine learning could reshape EPA drinking water standards.

New York City operates the largest unfiltered surface water supply in the United States, serving 10 million people under an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Filtration Avoidance Determination (FAD). The determination is a regulatory waiver that allows the city to avoid constructing a filtration plant—saving billions in infrastructure costs—provided it maintains stringent watershed protection standards and demonstrates continuous compliance with federal drinking water regulations.

Recent advances in machine learning (ML) may transform how water utilities meet these compliance obligations. Researchers have demonstrated that ML models can forecast tributary turbidity contributions with actionable accuracy, potentially enabling proactive watershed management rather than reactive responses to water quality events. This capability raises fundamental regulatory questions: Should the EPA incorporate predictive ML models into FAD compliance frameworks? What validation standards would apply? And how might algorithmic source attribution shift evidentiary burdens in enforcement proceedings?

The stakes are significant. Portland lost its FAD after detecting naturally occurring pathogens, forcing the city to pursue costly filtration infrastructure. New York City Council oversight hearings in October 2024 emphasized the critical need for New York City Department of Environmental Protection research investment to maintain the city’s FAD status. Meanwhile, the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo eliminated Chevron deference, raising questions about judicial review of agency technical determinations—including those involving machine learning models.

The regulatory landscape is also evolving rapidly. OMB issued the first government-wide AI policy in March 2024 requiring minimum practices for safety-impacting AI by December 2024. And in January 2024, researchers published a machine learning model that can predict whether the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers—the federal agency responsible for issuing permits for activities affecting navigable waters—would classify a particular water body as falling under federal jurisdiction. The researchers’ model demonstrates that machine learning can predict Clean Water Act (CWA) jurisdictional determinations—a precedent for integrating ML into water regulation more broadly.

These developments also carry environmental justice implications. Heavily monitored watersheds, such as the Upper Esopus, benefit from extensive sensor networks and research investment, while under-resourced communities lack comparable infrastructure for predicting and preventing water quality threats.

In this week’s Saturday Seminar, scholars examine the regulatory challenges and opportunities posed by integrating machine learning into drinking water regulation.

In an article published in the JAWRA Journal of the American Water Resources Association, John T. Kemper of the University of Vermont and colleagues demonstrate that machine learning models can forecast turbidity in NYC’s drinking water watershed with actionable accuracy. Kemper and his coauthors combine high-frequency sensor data with U.S. National Water Model output to predict tributary turbidity contributions, enabling water managers to anticipate rather than react to water quality events. They find that their models can provide useful 24-hour forecasts, suggesting ML-based monitoring could enhance real-time watershed management and potentially transform how utilities demonstrate FAD compliance.

In a study published in Science, Simon Greenhill of the University of California, Berkeley, and colleagues introduce a machine learning model that predicts Clean Water Act jurisdictional determinations with high accuracy. The Greenhill team trains their model on more than 150,000 historical Army Corps of Engineers decisions to classify whether particular waters fall under federal protection. They argue that WOTUS-ML demonstrates the viability of using machine learning to support regulatory implementation in water law contexts. The Greenhill team estimates that under different regulatory interpretations, between one-fourth and two-thirds of U.S. wetlands and streams fall under CWA protection, providing a framework that could serve as precedent for integrating ML into other areas of environmental regulation.

In an article in the Administrative Law Review, Cary Coglianese of The University of Pennsylvania Carey Law School, and Daniel E. Walters of Texas A&M Law, examine the implications of Loper Bright for administrative governance. Coglianese and Walters argue that the elimination of Chevron deference creates significant uncertainty for agency technical determinations, including those that may involve machine learning models. They suggest that the decision might best be considered “something of a Rorschach test inside a crystal ball,” where different observers may see different implications. Coglianese and Walters contend that courts reviewing ML-based regulatory decisions will need new frameworks for evaluating agency expertise and interpretive authority, with particular implications for science-intensive determinations such as those underlying EPA drinking water standards.

In an article in the Minnesota Law Review, Joshua D. Blank of UC Irvine School of Law, and Leigh Osofsky of UNC School of Law, examine federal agencies’ use of automated tools to communicate legal guidance to the public. Blank and Osofsky argue that although chatbots, virtual assistants, and AI systems offer administrative efficiency, they may mislead the public about how law applies to their circumstances. Based on an Administrative Conference of the United States-commissioned study, Blank and Osofsky propose policy recommendations emphasizing transparency, appropriate reliance, and equity. They contend that these considerations are directly relevant to how EPA might deploy ML-based compliance tools while maintaining public trust in drinking water regulation.

In an article in Competition Policy International: TechReg Chronicle, Cary Coglianese of The University of Pennsylvania Law School addresses the challenges of regulating machine learning systems that serve diverse applications across contexts. Coglianese argues that ML’s heterogeneity—the fact that the same underlying techniques may produce vastly different tools with different risk profiles—complicates traditional regulatory approaches that assume more uniform technologies. He contends that regulators must develop flexible frameworks capable of addressing context-specific concerns rather than applying one-size-fits-all rules. Coglianese suggests that agencies like EPA should build capacity in data sciences, deploy management-based regulatory strategies, and remain vigilant when considering how to validate ML models for varied environmental applications such as watershed monitoring.

In an article in Science of the Total Environment, Seigi Karasaki and Rachel Morello-Frosch of the UC Berkeley School of Public Health, and Duncan Callaway of the UC Berkeley Energy and Resources Group, examine how machine learning modeling decisions for drinking water quality prediction can produce differential outcomes across demographic groups. The Karasaki team proposes practices for reducing algorithmic bias in water quality applications. They find that model design choices—including which variables to include and how to weight training data—can affect which communities receive accurate predictions. The Karasaki team suggests that modeling choice transparency and bias-vetting practices may be important when applying machine learning to questions of environmental science and justice.

Thank you. Yes, this is my hometown, and I want to give a warm welcome on a cold day to our friends from Ontario who aren't bothered by cold weather, fortunately. And so, I'm delighted to be able to showcase this extraordinary venue — which we'll talk about momentarily — but for Premier Ford to come here, I'm very grateful that you and your team have made the journey here to do something that I think is landmark. It's extraordinary and very exciting as someone who's from this community and knows that we're going to find a way to continue to work together in partnership the way we always have and always will do.

I want to acknowledge Nicolle Butcher, the President and CEO of Ontario Power Generation. Thank you for lending your expertise to the cause. Minister Lecce, the Legislative Assembly from Ontario. Justin Driscoll, our CEO and President of New York Power Authority. Justin and John Koelmel, the Chairman of the New York Power Authority. All my partners in government. I see our incoming mayor is here, I think. Anybody else? And Crystal here? Crystal Peoples-Stokes — Sean Ryan and Crystal Peoples-Stokes, our many Assemblymembers and elected officials who have joined us here today.

It is great to be here to discuss our energy future, and it's especially fitting. We're here at the Buffalo AKG Museum of Art. And why I wanted to come here? Of any place in the state I could do this is what I'm reminded of — not this building, but the building that you'll see — the older looking building is from the 1901 era. And it was built in order to help showcase the fact that Buffalo was basically the epicenter of everything at the time when it came to power, because we were the first city in the world to be electrified. And so, we had electric lights. People were fascinated by this. What do you mean electric lights? How can that be? And people came from all over to see this in the entire exhibition.

So it was certainly a high point, but a reminder that we can continue energy innovation and how to do power innovation as we venture into this next century. Buffalo is known as the City of Light. And actually I'll say the museum was built for the exhibition, it wasn't done in time. So it missed the opening, but we still celebrate it associated with that as well. But this new building is a reminder of the future and a reminder that traditions matter. And there's been a long standing, proud tradition of cooperation between New York and Ontario. This has always been — this is our neighbor.

[...]

Yeah. We've done so much together, and I'll just digress and say I'm a boater on Lake Erie. It's one of the most beautiful places in the world, and we stop at many of the ports in Colborne, Canada, Ontario, and just feel that warm embrace of a shared bond that our region brings to all of us. It's not just sports — go Blue Jays next time. You did very well this year, but also, I know you're rooting for the Buffalo Bills, and you come to hockey games and the baseball games in the summertime as well. But also our cultures, our tourism. You find me in my old life many times up at Niagara-on-the-Lake or strolling around both sides of the falls.

And so it is just — it's a world class region, and we need to continue working together to promote these incredible assets, but also the strength of our friendship and relationship, which is enduring. And I'm also reminded, we just came off of the bicentennial, the celebration of the Erie Canal — something that was an extraordinary feat of engineering and its time, but also it opened up Canada to New York City. And that connection also was one of the catalysts for explosive growth opening in the Midwest Canadian cities, ultimately the St. Lawrence Seaway that came through. So we've always been connected through waterways and energy sources as well.

And our economies are intertwined. The trade, despite some setbacks — won't go into too much detail there, but we want to make sure that our trade relationship remains trustworthy. It's a beneficial relationship, we understand that. And I'll acknowledge that there've been some terrible policies that have come out of Washington coincidentally just in the one year, and they've been hard to accept as someone who doesn't understand why there's a hostility toward Canada overall. But certainly it shakes us to our core as well as people who value our friends in Ontario and Quebec, particularly as they border our great state.

So I don't want those policies to jeopardize the goodwill, the friendship. And we just want to make sure that we continue doing things that show that collaboration. And as these threats out of Washington come, we're going to stand firm and let people know who our friends are who we also care about very deeply. So our partnership between New York and Ontario is rock solid, and as long as I'm Governor, it's going to stay that way.

And so we sat down together. It's about relationships. Premier Ford and I sat down together. It was a meeting of Northeast governors and the Canadian premiers that all bordered this region. We got together in Boston to talk about the threats out of Washington, how destabilizing that is for trade and our relationships overall, but how we can individually step up and ignore that process — those threats, that hostility — and show we truly are friends. And so we talked about economic opportunities. We also had a great conversation about power, and the Premier spoke with great pride about what is occurring in the Darlington area. We are focusing on small modular reactors, and I was very impressed, and so I wanted to learn more.

And I was intrigued with your forward thinking approach to delivering clean energy for the next generation. And so we focused on how we can stay true to our environmental commitments, which I truly believe in, but also our commitment to rate payers to keep utility costs affordable — which is not just a buzzword, it is the reality. We, as leaders, have to focus on reliability, sustainability and affordability all at the same time. So we found a way together, and that is through nuclear energy. And Ontario is already home to — is it 17 of 18 nuclear plants operating in Canada? So, ahead of your time. And Ontario Power Generation is leading the way in deploying North America's first small modular reactors, which I've been very intrigued with — very intrigued with. And the Darlington project, which you'll talk about, is going to be generating 1.2 gigawatts of power. And our conversation also led me to the understanding that OPG is collaborating with the Tennessee Valley Authority as well.

When you said that, I said, “Wait a minute? Why are you cooperating with them? I'm right here.” So that was another thought — that light bulb that went off in my head. Like, why aren't we also taking advantage of your forward-thinking approach when it comes to power?

So today — to cement these conversations just from a few months ago to add some substance to them — OPG signed a memorandum of understanding with NYPA to work together to share information on the best ways to bring advanced nuclear power to the State of New York. And they'll use their expertise, and knowhow and be a great resource in our next chapter in our nuclear story. And the timing is perfect because last summer I charged NYPA — our Executive Director, and our Chairman and others — to find a way to bring advanced nuclear power to Upstate New York. And this will be the first plant in New York State in over a generation.

And I wanted to do this because it's about reliability, affordability, but it's also about the thousands of jobs that are created in the process. And I was excited about that prospect as well. And one gigawatt of nuclear power can power roughly one million homes without adding any carbon to the atmosphere. That's really significant. And it's around the clock. It's every day of the year. It's completely insulated from the threats of rising oil and gas prices.

I believe it can power the industries of tomorrow as we're leaning into, especially here in Upstate New York, Micron — $100 billion investment to make semiconductor chips. The largest private sector investment in American history is going on just down the road in Syracuse. Right up the road in Buffalo, the University of Buffalo, we have $500 million being invested in Empire AI — artificial intelligence for public good. So we need the power source. We want to do all this. Our ambitions are broad, they're exciting, but if we don't power it, it doesn't work. And that's the challenge that we've embraced and we're moving with great speed.

I'm very impatient and I want this to happen. I know there's traditionally been hurdles. Our state has right now three nuclear plants operating. They're all up on Lake Ontario. And one is actually the oldest operating nuclear facility in the United States — going strong and safe since 1969. But it's time for us to bring new nuclear technology into the 21st century. I've spoken, actually, to President Trump about this in the White House and talked about the fact that people aren't embracing nuclear because there's a perception it is a long, arduous process, even a decade to get approvals. And we gleaned that over seven of the 10 years it takes to get nuclear approvals are at the federal level. So he has agreed to find ways to approach that with more urgency.

We are working closely with the federal administration in this particular area, and I want to make sure that everyone knows that we'll bring down the barriers and the costs. That's important. But also, this is not your grandmother's and your grandfather's nuclear. This is advanced. This is state of the art. This is safe. This is safe. And it has automatic safety systems, enhanced containment and rigorous, very rigorous, environmental safeguards.

So since the last six months when I directed NYPA to build a gigawatt of new nuclear capacity, we've moved aggressively to realize that vision. The deadline for request for information passed just last week, and I'm happy to announce that there are 23 developers who've expressed an interest in developing nuclear projects with NYPA. That's extraordinary. That's beyond what I could have imagined. That's a new era for nuclear power in the State of New York. And eight communities have expressed interest in hosting a plant, Also a very positive development. So what we want to do is make sure we also have the workforce to be able to do all this exciting work. And I've announced $40 million over the next four years in new funding for NYPA to launch a specialized nuclear workforce training program with our unions and our universities. So that's how we'll meet the demand by focusing now on the training required so we have the workforce in place.

And we've made some strategic hires at NYPA. Christopher Hanson, the former Chair of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission was hired as a senior consultant to help us navigate that federal licensing. And I'm sorry I took Todd Josifovski, hired as our Senior Vice President of Nuclear Development, formerly the Project Director at Darlington — which you're already underway, so we need some help. Okay? You're good with that?

So he'll make sure that — just as is happening at Darlington, which he’ll talk about, is that the constructional process, very quickly. So the first phase that is being licensed this year will be on track and operational. Our goal is to be within five years, not 10, but five years.

And so, we've been excited about this and bringing a closer relationship. And in a couple minutes, Premier Ford and I will sign a Declaration of Intent to reaffirm and strengthen our historic bonds. We'll show the world that we have no tolerance for policies that are intended to drive us apart. We look forward to working together through this particular opportunity and many, many more as we focus on the sharing of opportunities, and resources, and intellect and expertise that'll help bolster both of our economies, and keep us strong and to keep the lights on.",https://www.governor.ny.gov/sites/default/files/styles/cover_image_660x400_/public/2025-12/nuclearenergyhero2.jpg?h=489870a4&itok=XT17D1TD,N,,2025-12-20 06:57:24.638357

Eleven Democrats joined 210 Republicans to support the bill, introduced by Arkansas Republican Bruce Westerman, while one GOP moderate voted against it. Westerman said after the act passed that it would reduce unnecessary permitting delays and make it easier for local governments to complete “economy-stimulating” projects.

“You may not realize it but permitting touches all aspects of life, from the ability to complete roadways and bridges that can prevent traffic jams all the way to the ability to lower the cost of your monthly electricity bill,” the congressman said in a statement.

“This isn’t just legislation for large, federal industries, it’s a bill for you and every other taxpaying Arkansan.”

Some Democrats who voted against the act include party leadership and members of the progressive caucus. The bill favors the Trump administration’s energy agenda, according to the caucus, which opposes fossil fuel industries.

“Environmental protection groups warn that this is a dangerous attempt to gut NEPA, the nation’s bedrock environmental law, turning it into a toothless procedural formality,” the group said in a statement. “The effect of this bill will be to prioritize oil and gas, and SPEED Act does nothing to advance permitting reforms for clean energy that progressives have long championed.”

House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, contrastingly described the bill as part of a “pro-growth” agenda. He said the permitting process has “driven up” costs and blocked critical energy and infrastructure projects for far too long.

“The National Environmental Policy Act has been stretched far beyond its original intent, and we are taking away its ability to be weaponized or misused for activist-driven litigation and partisan agendas,” Johnson explained. “House Republicans continue to pass commonsense legislation that codifies President Trump’s executive orders and advances a pro-growth agenda to lower energy costs, strengthen national security, unleash American energy production, and get American workers and industry building again.”

Meg O’Neill | Photographer: Nicky Loh/Bloomberg

The surprise exit of Woodside Energy Group Ltd. Chief Executive Officer Meg O’Neill leaves her successor with a dilemma: should the Australian company continue down the path she set of promoting massive liquefied natural gas projects when forecasts point to a glut and lower prices?

O’Neill had been a forceful advocate for two major projects: Browse — a long-delayed plan to tap vast offshore reserves in Western Australia — and an expansion of the company’s export terminal in Louisiana, which is still under construction. Her stance reflected a company forecast for a 50% jump in global LNG demand over the next decade — one of the most bullish in the industry.

But with O’Neill now set to helm oil major BP Plc in April, Woodside’s incoming CEO will need to decide whether to stay the course as a record wave of global LNG supply is poised to flood the market and drag down prices for the remainder of the decade. Coupled with a surplus of oil, Woodside will face growing questions from investors about why it is doubling down on fossil-fuel expansion at a time when supply is abundant.

“The board and the new CEO can now rethink the value destructive Browse project, which is more expensive than 70% of competing potential new gas supplies around the world, as well as the expansion of Louisiana LNG,” the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility, or ACCR, said in a statement on Thursday.

Source: BloombergNEF Global LNG Market Outlook 2030, July 14, 2025

At the core of the debate is the future role of natural gas. O’Neill and other industry leaders argue that gas will help coal-dependent nations transition to a cleaner-burning fossil fuel while providing reliable backup for intermittent renewable power.

However, that outlook isn’t guaranteed. Volatile LNG prices have pushed some emerging nations to rethink their reliance on imports — Pakistan, for instance, is stepping back from LNG as households and businesses turn rapidly to solar. Others, including India and China, are leaning on cheaper coal to bolster energy security and keep costs down.

Global LNG supply is set to jump by more than 50% by 2030 from 2024, far more than demand growth in recent years, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analysts including Daan Struyven said in a note on Thursday. “LNG prices will likely have to decline significantly as this oversupply builds to incentivize additional demand,” they said.

That creates some uncertainty over Woodside’s long-term strategy, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. “O’Neill’s successor might rewrite Woodside’s gas playbook — a probability that could weigh on sentiment until the future path is clear,” analyst Anthony Chen said in a note.

Still, O’Neill has said that she looks at making decisions that will pan out over decades, and won’t get derailed by short-term market trends. According to a note from Bernstein, she has taken a disciplined approach relative to peers, exiting several green-hydrogen and renewables projects based on weakened demand, and refocused efforts on LNG.

That approach has helped Woodside become a larger player in the global gas market. She has cleared a path for North West Shelf — a sprawling LNG export plant that earlier this year was granted clearance to continue operating until 2070. And she oversaw the approval of the Scarborough offshore field, which is expected begin shipments during the second half of next year.

One of O’Neill’s last acts was restructuring the company’s LNG trading desk, including hiring a new head from Equinor ASA, to better withstand lower prices and market the wave of new supply, according to people with knowledge of the matter.

Several contenders for the top job have already been mooted in industry circles. Woodside Chief Operating Officer Daniel Kalms and Chief Commercial Officer Mark Abbotsford are among potential picks, according to two people with knowledge of the company’s deliberations. The senior vice president for M&A, Dan Hamilton, could also be in the running, said another industry source who has worked closely with the company.

For now, Australian Chief Operating Officer Liz Westcott is running Woodside as interim CEO. The company is looking at internal and external candidates and plans to announce a permanent appointment in the first quarter, it said on Thursday.

The new chief will be tasked with lining line up another equity partner for Woodside’s $17.5 billion Louisiana LNG project and keep the company’s foray into Mexico on track as the Trion development moves toward producing oil later this decade.

On top of that, they will have to face increasingly vocal opposition from climate campaigners and the company’s own shareholders. At a meeting in May, protesters repeatedly interrupted O’Neill’s opening address by blowing on whistles, while a year earlier Woodside investors rejected the company’s climate strategy in a non-binding vote.

“Woodside has been persistently unresponsive to shareholder concerns,” the ACCR said. “Investors will be hoping that O’Neill’s departure is a circuit breaker on Woodside’s habit of pursuing high-capex, marginal fossil fuel projects, and is an opportunity to instead start focusing on better capital returns.”

Data centers are hubs for information technology equipment including servers, storage systems, networking equipment and other hardware for storing and distributing data. These facilities act as the infrastructure for web-based services and are used in developing artificial intelligence.

However, these facilities demand large amounts of energy to operate and large amounts of water to cool the machinery inside, with environmental and consumer advocacy watchdogs warning these facilities can herald skyrocketing energy rates while harming drinking water access in nearby communities.

In response, state Sens. Rosemary Bayer (D-West Bloomfield), Sue Shink (D-Northfield Township) and Erika Geiss (D-Taylor) have introduced three bills to begin regulating the influx of data center facilities aiming to set up shop in Michigan.

Bayer’s Senate Bill 761 would bar entities withdrawing above an average of 2,000,000 gallons of water per day for consumptive use – where the water is lost and is not returned to the system – from obtaining a water withdrawal permit.

Shink’s Senate Bill 762 would create transparency standards on how much water and energy these facilities use, by requiring the Michigan Public Service Commission to publish annual reports regarding the total energy expenditures and water usage of data centers.

Geiss’s Senate Bill 763 would bar water utilities from passing off the infrastructure costs to accommodate a data center onto residential customers.

“We have seen hyperscale data center projects proposed in Saline, Battle Creek, Mason, and many other places throughout Michigan,” Bayer said in a statement.

Environmental advocates earlier this month alleged that developer Acoma, LLC’s plans, if approved, would allow Project Jupiter to emit as many greenhouse gases annually as New Mexico’s two largest cities combined. The November applications called for the construction of two natural gas generating stations to power the data center project and approximated they would generate about as much electricity as the entire PNM system.

Developers estimated the two gas plants would together put nearly 500 tons per year of nitrogen oxides, an important ingredient in contributing to ozone, in the air. One of the generating stations — referred to as a “microgrid,” which describes developments that generate their own electricity without drawing from a larger power company’s grid — was listed at 249.97 tons per year and the other at 248.9. Developers sought an individual permit for the microgrids, even though they will support the same development.

Critics said the developers behind Project Jupiter appeared to be evading state regulations, which classify projects with at least 250 tons per year of nitrogen oxides as “major sources” of hazardous air pollutants and subject them to arduous monitoring.

A development “that is 1.1 tons away from the 250” threshold is “not practically enforceable,” NMED officials on Wednesday wrote to Project Jupiter’s developers of one of the proposed microgrids. Air in the surrounding area will also be impacted by the nearby microgrid that is planned to produce essentially the same amount of nitrogen oxides, they wrote.

Maslyn Locke, a New Mexico Environmental Law Center senior attorney who is representing nearby residents in a lawsuit against the Doña Ana County Board of Commissioners, said she was encouraged by the NMED decision.

“This reminder that the rules still apply is a good thing,” Locke said. “Of course, it’s not going to stop everything. It’s just giving us a little more time to wrap our heads around it.”

This week, Locke’s organization sent NMED a list of demands, including that the department widely distribute materials related to the project in both English and Spanish.

Did you know the child tax credit increased? Let’s break down how recent tax law impacted this valuable tax credit.

The Child Tax Credit is a federal income tax credit available to certain families with children. Under the One Big Beautiful Bill, also known as the Working Families Tax Cut, some of the amounts and qualification rules have changed.

Starting with your 2025 tax return, the maximum credit increases from $2,000 to $2,200 for each qualifying child. And from 2026 forward, that amount will be adjusted annually for inflation, helping the credit keep up with the cost of living.Now, what about qualifications?

Before these changes, there were seven rules that determined whether a child was eligible. Now, there are eight. To qualify, a child generally must meet the following requirements.

One: The child must have been 16 or younger at the end of the tax year.

Two: The child must be your child, stepchild, adopted child, foster child, or a sibling.

Three: The child must be claimed as a dependent on your tax return.

Four: The child must not have provided more than half of their own support during the tax year.

Five: The child must have lived with you for more than half of the tax year.

Six: If the child is married and files a joint return, they only qualify if that joint return is filed solely to claim a refund of withheld income tax or estimated tax payments.

Seven: The child must be a U.S. citizen, U.S. national, or a U.S. resident alien.

And eight: The child and at least one person claiming the credit are now required to have work-eligible Social Security numbers.

So, what’s staying the same?

The Child Tax Credit remains partially refundable. The refundable portion, called the Additional Child Tax Credit, can be worth up to $1,700 per qualifying child for 2025.

Depending on your situation, that part can increase your refund, while the nonrefundable portion can at best reduce your tax bill to $0.

Income limits have also stayed the same. You can claim the full credit if your income is $200,000 or less for single filers, or $400,000 or less if married filing jointly. Once your income goes above those amounts, the credit gradually decreases by $50 for every $1,000 of income above the limit.

Recent tax law changes bring several new tax laws for 2025 and beyond. Understanding how they affect you doesn’t have to be stressful. Filers could see up to $1,000 refund increase or lower balance due, based on recent tax law changes.

The bill would change the National Environmental Policy Act, a 1969 law requiring federal environmental impact studies, to make the approval process for government projects easier.

Eleven Democrats joined 210 Republicans to support the bill, introduced by Arkansas Republican Bruce Westerman, while one GOP moderate voted against it. Westerman said after the act passed that it would reduce unnecessary permitting delays and make it easier for local governments to complete “economy-stimulating” projects.

“You may not realize it but permitting touches all aspects of life, from the ability to complete roadways and bridges that can prevent traffic jams all the way to the ability to lower the cost of your monthly electricity bill,” the congressman said in a statement.

“This isn’t just legislation for large, federal industries, it’s a bill for you and every other taxpaying Arkansan.”

Some Democrats who voted against the act include party leadership and members of the progressive caucus. The bill favors the Trump administration’s energy agenda, according to the caucus, which opposes fossil fuel industries.

“Environmental protection groups warn that this is a dangerous attempt to gut NEPA, the nation’s bedrock environmental law, turning it into a toothless procedural formality,” the group said in a statement. “The effect of this bill will be to prioritize oil and gas, and SPEED Act does nothing to advance permitting reforms for clean energy that progressives have long championed.”

House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, contrastingly described the bill as part of a “pro-growth” agenda. He said the permitting process has “driven up” costs and blocked critical energy and infrastructure projects for far too long.

“The National Environmental Policy Act has been stretched far beyond its original intent, and we are taking away its ability to be weaponized or misused for activist-driven litigation and partisan agendas,” Johnson explained. “House Republicans continue to pass commonsense legislation that codifies President Trump’s executive orders and advances a pro-growth agenda to lower energy costs, strengthen national security, unleash American energy production, and get American workers and industry building again.”

The Trump administration has prioritized fossil fuel energy sources over renewable ones, and Democrats have expressed concern about the environmental impacts of its approach.",https://wlos.com/resources/media2/16x9/4000/1320/0x104/90/d6cff8f7-1bc3-481d-97ad-c2d7a90c458d-GettyImages22425071171.jpg,N,,2025-12-20 03:57:51.974354

ESS News spoke with leaders from around the energy storage industry to learn more about what they expect for the year ahead.
“The combined impact of collapsing revenues and soaring costs has made battery storage economics unworkable for many developers.
In Texas, the country’s largest battery storage market, revenues crashed in 2024 and 2025.
“It’s people, not just technologies, that have actively reshaped the energy storage industry this year.","2025 was a tumultuous year for the energy storage industry, and it left market forces tugging the industry in different directions. AI and data center-driven energy demand is skyrocketing while electricity prices are hitting highs; battery costs are shifting unevenly, project economics are under strain and a suite of policies set to come into effect in the New Year will cause even more shake-up.

ESS News spoke with leaders from around the energy storage industry to learn more about what they expect for the year ahead.

Rising electricity prices will push storage further into the spotlight as a cost and reliability solution.

“Everything is getting more expensive for families (groceries, household goods, gas) but electricity doesn’t have to be. We’re entering what I see as a twin crisis: the need for a more reliable electricity supply and relief for ratepayers facing rising costs. In 2026, the real test for the energy industry will be whether we can move fast enough to tackle both. Speed to market will be the single biggest driver of energy deployment next year, and energy storage can scale fast and cost effectively.” – Arvin Ganesan, CEO, Fourth Power

Battery prices will continue falling, even as tariffs and policy uncertainty reshape deployment timelines.

“I see battery prices continuing to drop at the start of the year with more energy being stored in smaller containers. While the tariffs are delaying some new projects, existing wind, solar, and grid shortages will need significant quantities of batteries, so no energy is wasted, and customers can still buy low-cost electricity at off hours…[and], President Trump will be forced to allow renewable energy projects to start again as a way to help the sagging economy to get moving before the elections under the pressure from big business for low-cost electricity.” – Steve Feinberg, President, Bluewater Battery Logistics

“The biggest unknown for next year remains how we’ll keep pace with surging electricity demand…Renewables and storage will continue to do the bulk of the heavy lifting. Solar, wind, and batteries are the fastest, cheapest, most scalable way to add firm power. Anyone who thinks otherwise is clinging to an outdated narrative.” – Peter Davidson, CEO and co-founder, Aligned Climate Capital

Storage economics will look better on paper than in practice.

“The combined impact of collapsing revenues and soaring costs has made battery storage economics unworkable for many developers. In Texas, the country’s largest battery storage market, revenues crashed in 2024 and 2025. In California, net annual revenues per kW of battery capacity decreased from $103/kW in 2022 to $78/kW in 2023 and just $53/kW in 2024 due to lower peak hour prices. On top of that, the cost and complexity of building battery storage is rising.” – Michael Thomas, CEO, Cleanview

It’s anyone’s guess whether 2026 will bring widespread cancellations or a late-year surge in battery demand.

“Project cancellations will be a thing of the past. Late in the year, we will see a huge demand for batteries with longer lead times.” – Steve Feinberg, President, Bluewater Battery Logistics

“I think we’re likely to see a lot of battery storage projects canceled in 2026. Projects that penciled at $192/kW in revenue with $100/kWh battery costs in 2023 now face $55/kW in revenue with $130/kWh costs—a fundamental shift that has forced developers to cancel 79 GW of planned capacity nationwide in 2025 [according to Cleanview’s data].” – Michael Thomas, CEO, Cleanview

Workforce constraints may be the limiting factor for storage deployment.

“It’s people, not just technologies, that have actively reshaped the energy storage industry this year. The heart of this shift is human. Communities demand safer options, utilities seek partners they can trust and teams across the country are working together to solve problems. Innovation is a people-first race to deliver storage that makes energy solutions more resilient for everyone. Looking ahead to 2026, the future of advanced battery energy storage will be defined by teams who lead with partnership, purpose and passion.” – Julie Royes, Vice President of Corporate Affairs, CMBlu Energy, Inc.

“As we look ahead to 2026, we will begin to see supply chain and workforce challenges easing for sectors tied to electrification or distribution level but continue to see long lead times for power transformers. The global shortage of skilled labor, especially in high-voltage, high-power transformers, is slowing production and driving up costs across the grid supply chain. We’re hearing from major manufacturers that the best training programs for this work are overseas, which creates real logistical and timeline hurdles for U.S. facilities.” – Charles Murray, CEO and Co-Founder, Switched Source

As the storage market fragments by use case, application-specific storage strategies will gain momentum.

“2026 won’t be the year EVs, grid storage, and data centers converge into a single battery roadmap, but instead, it will be the year each of those markets becomes large enough to justify its own optimized battery designs. What looks like convergence today is really just parallel scale. Automakers, utilities and data centers all care about cost, safety, and reliability, but each weighs those factors differently. Shared platforms will only win where cost reduction clearly outweighs performance tradeoffs. Outside of that, we’ll actually see more application-specific battery designs, not fewer.” – Joe Adiletta, CEO, Volexion

“[California’s] Assembly Bill (AB) 2514 proves early that purpose-driven storage procurement is both possible and effective, and the energy storage industry continues to build on that foundation with broader technology diversity and stronger bankability requirements.” – Giovanni Damato, President, CMBlu Energy, Inc.

Corporate buyers will cautiously diversify storage portfolios beyond lithium-ion.

“Currently, most corporate storage portfolios favor batteries due to their rapid deployment and established supply chains…however, market signals and investment trends indicate that diversification is gradually taking shape. Some sophisticated industrial users are piloting alternative technologies, but widespread portfolio diversity is unlikely to materialize until the 2030s, when these alternatives prove their economic viability at scale. In 2026, batteries are expected to remain the dominant technology in corporate portfolios, with gradual diversification as pilot projects expand, innovation accelerates and new business models emerge.

In the interim, hybrid solutions that combine batteries with other storage types may become more attractive for industries seeking both short-term flexibility and longer-term capacity.” – Matt Kennedy, Global Head of Client Transformation, IDA Ireland

Utilities and grid operators will push for innovation.

“I’d expect to see data centers and electrification drive many innovative strategies from big-name utilities. Looking across the major utilities, we’re seeing some of these strategies emerge. Some have a heavy emphasis on energy storage and utility-owned generation, while others emphasize capital-light measures leveraging more advanced controls and grid-enhancing technologies to make better use of the infrastructure that’s in place. Both have pros and cons and will take years to prove out. Still, it is good to see utility CEOs rising to the occasion with new ideas and cohesive strategies, even if they vary greatly based on regional challenges and regulatory structures.” – Charles Murray, CEO and Co-Founder, Switched Source",https://www.ess-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/US.jpg,N,,2025-12-20 09:58:10.848239

Last year, the co-owners withdrew their air permit from the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources for the 625 MW fossil gas project.
“We are glad Minnesota Power has withdrawn from NTEC,” said Evan Mulholland, Healthy Communities Program Director at MCEA.
“NTEC would be bad for the climate, too expensive, harmful to public health, and it was proposed in the wrong location.
MCEA encourages Dairyland Power Cooperative and Basin Electric Power Cooperative to abandon their plans to build and operate NTEC.” ###","SUPERIOR, Wis. — Today, in a Minnesota Public Utilities Commission filing by Minnesota Power, the company announced that it will withdraw from the proposed Nemadji Trail Energy Center (NTEC) gas plant project, which it had been developing with Dairyland Power Cooperative (based in Wisconsin) and Basin Electric Power Cooperative (based in North Dakota). Minnesota Power had been a 50% owner and planned to build and operate the plant.

Last year, the co-owners withdrew their air permit from the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources for the 625 MW fossil gas project. The withdrawal happened after the City of Superior voted to deny local zoning permits necessary for the project to move forward. Local residents, Dairyland and Minnesota Power customers, Fond du Lac and Red Cliff Tribes, and environmental groups, including Sierra Club, Minnesota Center for Environmental Advocacy (MCEA), Healthy Climate Wisconsin, and Clean Wisconsin, have been calling for a full project cancellation for years.

“This is the right step forward to protect air quality in Superior and the surrounding communities. NTEC was outdated almost as soon as it was proposed, and years of delays have underscored what a poor idea this is. There’s no need for another new dirty, expensive gas plant in Wisconsin. All eyes are on Dairyland to cancel plans for NTEC once and for all as we transition to clean energy,” said Elizabeth Ward, Sierra Club Wisconsin Chapter Director.

“We are glad Minnesota Power has withdrawn from NTEC,” said Evan Mulholland, Healthy Communities Program Director at MCEA. “NTEC would be bad for the climate, too expensive, harmful to public health, and it was proposed in the wrong location. MCEA encourages Dairyland Power Cooperative and Basin Electric Power Cooperative to abandon their plans to build and operate NTEC.”

As previously discussed in Brass Tax, proposed regulations for Section 4501 issued in 2024 intentionally omitted exceptions for several types of transactions that many commentators believed should not be subject to the excise tax.
The final regulations omit the rule altogether.
The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter.
Specialist advice should be sought about your specific circumstances.","On the day before Thanksgiving, the Treasury and IRS issued final regulations for the Section 4501 excise tax on stock repurchases. Enacted as part of the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022, Section 4501 imposes a 1% excise tax on repurchases of stock by public U.S. companies, as well as purchases of the stock of foreign publicly traded corporations by their U.S. affiliates.

As previously discussed in Brass Tax, proposed regulations for Section 4501 issued in 2024 intentionally omitted exceptions for several types of transactions that many commentators believed should not be subject to the excise tax. In the final regulations, the Treasury and IRS have backtracked on those omissions, and have included a number of exceptions for transactions that are in form redemptions of stock (or so treated for federal income tax purposes), but are generally not seen as the sort of repurchases that Congress intended the excise tax to target, including:

repurchases of ""plain vanilla"" or ""debt-like"" preferred stock

payment of consideration funded by the target corporation in take-private transactions (which is generally treated as a redemption for U.S. federal income tax purposes)

redemptions of additional forms of ""tier 1 capital,"" such as that issued by cooperative banks and agricultural credit associations

acquisitions and cancellations of stock in certain liquidations and acquisitive reorganizations

exchanges of stock in single-party reorganizations (that is, recapitalizations that qualify as ""E"" reorganizations and changes in identity, form or place of organization that qualify as ""F"" reorganizations)

certain repurchases by investment companies that do not qualify as RICs for federal income tax purposes (repurchases by companies that qualify as RICs or REITs were already exempt)

In addition, the final regulations do not include the controversial ""funding rule"" that appeared in prior IRS guidance, under which a foreign corporation's repurchase of its own stock would have been subject to the excise tax to the extent the repurchase was funded by a U.S. affiliate. The funding rule contained in the 2024 proposed regulations, under which repurchases funded by a U.S. affiliate would have been taxable only if done ""with a principal purpose of avoiding"" the excise tax, already represented a retreat from an earlier, more mechanical version in Notice 2023-2. That more limited funding rule nevertheless attracted significant criticism, including that compliance with the rule would be administratively burdensome and its ""principal purpose"" test could be vague and indeterminate in many cases. The final regulations omit the rule altogether.

Mercedes-Benz and Jeep Lead PHEV Market Amid Declining Interest in Pure Electric Cars

As reported by Autoblog, Saturday, December 20, the deepest slump was felt by the electric vehicle (EV) sector, which has been hailed as the future. Sales of EVs in the fourth quarter are projected to fall sharply by 37 percent compared to last year, with the market share shrinking to only 5.7 percent. This decline is very contrasting when compared to the third quarter, where consumers flocked to buy EVs in pursuit of tax credits of up to US $7,500 before the program ended in September.

The electric vehicle market is expected to plummet by 37 percent: Tesla still holds the reins as the EV market leader with a 46 percent share, followed by Chevrolet and Ford. However, Tesla's electrification is not immune from the economic storm; Elon Musk's manufacturer is expected to experience a sales decline of up to 29.8 percent in this closing quarter. On the other hand, ""bridge"" technology such as hybrid and plug-in hybrid (PHEV) cars continue to show their fangs, with Mercedes-Benz leading the PHEV segment as consumers begin to switch to options that are considered more realistic.

The harsh reality also hit middle-class and working-class communities who are increasingly squeezed by the high cost of vehicle ownership. In addition to the continued soaring new unit prices with an average transaction reaching nearly 50,000 US dollars, insurance costs, spare parts, and maintenance also rose significantly beyond the consumer price index. This condition forces the segment of cheap cars or compact cars to lose their place in the market, making the industry now only rely on premium class consumers who still have purchasing power.

The outlook for 2026 is still difficult to find optimism as Cox Auto predicts sales will fall back to 15.8 million units. Even though sales volumes have shrunk, major automotive manufacturers are predicted to still reap high profits. Their strategy has now shifted pragmatically: selling fewer vehicles but at a much higher price, making new car ownership a luxury that only a few high-end people can enjoy.",https://imgsrv2.voi.id/F5ULD3pDiZlE76ceQymN4EZF5au0EZwPBjnQN04-iwo/rs:fill/w:800/h:450/g:sm/wm:1:nowe:0:0:1/bG9jYWw6Ly8vcHVibGlzaGVycy81NDUwNjQvMjAyNTEyMTkxNzQ2LW1haW4uY3JvcHBlZF8xNzY2MTQxMTkyLmpwZw.jpg,N,,2025-12-20 10:59:15.575311

LITTLE ROCK, Ark., Dec. 19, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Entergy Arkansas yesterday announced Next Generation Arkansas, the company's comprehensive plan to provide electricity that does more for Arkansas by strengthening reliability, expanding energy supply, driving economic growth and keeping power affordable for all customers. The company, and its more than 2,800 employees, are focusing the plan and their efforts in the coming years on helping keep the state and its customers out in front of the emerging electric future developing in the U.S. and globally.

""Next Generation Arkansas is about preparing our state for what's ahead. By strengthening the grid, adding new generation and modernizing how we deliver power, we're making the system more reliable and more affordable while also building a system that enables unprecedented growth over the long term,"" said Laura Landreaux, Entergy Arkansas president and CEO. ""These investments help prevent outages, support new jobs and ensure that Arkansas families and businesses continue to benefit from low, predictable electricity costs as our state grows.""

Next Generation Arkansas is a multi-faceted plan that includes input from state and local leaders and Entergy Arkansas customers across the state to ensure transparency, accountability and open dialogue about affordability and how to best meet their needs. The plan represents the company's response to several power-related issues facing the state:

Recent state growth requiring more power to serve customers;

More extreme weather in recent years affecting customer reliability;

Increasing state competitiveness for job-creating projects; and

Cost pressures requiring new approaches to keep rates low for customers.

To meet this demand, Next Generation Arkansas has been built around four core priorities, detailed below.

1. Better power for Arkansas: Fewer outages, faster repairs

Entergy Arkansas is launching one of the most ambitious reliability improvement plans in recent history designed to make the power grid stronger and more reliable with an initial goal to reduce power outages by at least 30% over the coming years.

In addition to increasing vegetation investments that will keep power lines clear, the company is performing reliability improvement projects across the state and deploying new, advanced technology tools that will help spot problems faster, prevent challenges and improve power quality for decades to come.

The economic growth the company is helping enable is adding new large customers to the grid that helps offset the costs of these improvements for existing customers.

2. More power for Arkansas: Power when and where needed to meet soaring demand

Arkansas was recently ranked the fastest-growing state economy in America for two quarters in a row, the No. 1 state for inbound movers, and the state with the lowest cost of living. Arkansas is already expected to see more than a 35% increase in power needs in the next five years, and with projections showing that figure could more than double, Entergy Arkansas is acting now to build the next generation of power sources to support the state's growth and serve its customers while keeping rates affordable.

To do this, Entergy Arkansas plans to invest in approximately 2,600 MW of new, more fuel-efficient generation resources and repower approximately 1,600 MW of existing generation in the next five years pending approval from the Arkansas Public Service Commission, including:

Investing in new, modern natural gas plants to increase fuel efficiency by up to 40%, which lowers fuel charges on customer bills:

450 MW at the new Ironwood Power Station natural gas plant in Hot Spring County (2028).

750 MW at the new Jefferson Power Station natural gas plant in Jefferson County (2029).

600 MW of solar + 350 MW of battery storage at the Arkansas Cypress facility in Jefferson County (2028), which will provide clean, renewable power that lowers fuel charges on customer bills.

Retrofitting coal-fired generators to burn natural gas and extend their lives.

Investing in upgrades at existing natural gas facilities to increase output more than 150 MW.

Renewing the license to generate 1,800 MW of clean, reliable 24/7 energy produced by the Arkansas Nuclear One power plant and investing in new, more efficient plant equipment that increases the output of the facility.

These investments will ensure Arkansas has a balanced, more cost-efficient, ""all-of-the-above"" energy mix needed to support homes, businesses and new industries.

3. Job power for Arkansas: Helping the state recruit more and better jobs

Arkansas offers a strong pro-business environment, and over the past five years, Entergy Arkansas has partnered with state and community leaders to drive the creation of more than 7,500 jobs and over $13 billion in capital investments. As electricity becomes a key factor in securing new business, the state must continue delivering the power infrastructure and site development needed to compete. When structured strategically, these private investments not only generate tax revenue and quality jobs, but also provide broader benefits for Arkansans, including bill savings and a more reliable grid. The company plans to do this by:

Using the blueprint created by the Generating Arkansas Jobs Act of 2025 to work at the speed needed to compete nationally for once-in-a-generation tech and industrial projects.

Bolstering local job impact – Arkansas building Arkansas – by using local contractors and companies around the state whenever possible, reinvesting growth back into our communities through new jobs, state and local tax revenue, and indirect economic impact.

Creating economic impact while implementing the plan – for example, the development of the Ironwood, Jefferson Power Station and Arkansas Cypress power plants would create approximately 1,860 direct jobs as well as significantly more indirect jobs during construction, provide 46 permanent jobs during operation, and that will generate more than $105 million in new local and state tax revenue by 2030.

""We want to commend state leaders for passing the Generating Jobs Act of 2025, which is a landmark legislation and shows what's possible when Arkansas sets a bold vision for its future, and the Arkansas Public Service Commission for approving the new associated rider,"" Landreaux said. ""Because of the state's leadership, Arkansas has the tools to compete for once-in-a-generation opportunities. We are committed to delivering a power system that attracts new jobs, strengthens communities, and keeps our state moving forward for the next generation of Arkansans.""

4. Affordable power for Arkansas: Keeping rates low and predictable

Entergy Arkansas's rates remain 22% below the national average, and the company plans to continue finding ways to reduce costs, increase efficiency, and offer innovative bill solutions to keep power affordable for all customers, even as the company invests in the state's growth including:

Leveraging new policies to help build the power system Arkansas needs while keeping rate stable and predictable.

Using new technologies to help manage the grid and prevent outages at less cost to customers.

Providing customers with ways to lower their bills with new rate structures and by helping them access resources like free home energy checkups, free and discounted energy-saving products, and rebates on energy-efficient equipment purchases.

Continuing to recruit new large industrial customers to help spread the cost of maintaining and upgrading the power grid across a larger customer base and reduce the burden on residents and small businesses.

Working with new large customer partners to scale and accelerate energy affordability initiatives and encourage others to provide community support, as Google has with its $25 million Energy Impact Fund.

All of these efforts will be managed with transparency for customers and with direct oversight from the Arkansas Public Service Commission, Landreaux said.

""Our 2,800 Entergy employees in Arkansas and I understand that this is some of the most important work of our careers, and we feel it personally because we're Arkansans too,"" Landreaux said. ""We're proud to help deliver better power, more jobs and a brighter future for our fellow Arkansans.""

Despite the challenges, 2025 reinforced why independent environmental journalism matters. We produced groundbreaking work on data centers before it was mainstream. We held polluters accountable when enforcement wavered. We documented infrastructure failures and community resilience. We created tools — data dashboards, practical guides, and civic action toolboxes — that became essential resources for residents and advocates.

As we close out this challenging year, here’s how Planet Detroit held the line for Michigan’s environment and communities through the four pillars of our reporting: accountability, service, solutions, and community voices.

Here’s a rundown of the stories we reported on this year.

ACCOUNTABILITY: Exposing threats and holding power accountable

Data centers invade the state

We published this comprehensive look at small-town backlash against data center sprawl in September, ahead of the curve as other outlets scrambled to catch up months later. The story captured rural communities speaking out against Big Tech’s energy-hungry infrastructure. The David-versus-Goliath battles in Washtenaw County foreshadowed a statewide pattern.

Our June piece on Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s appointment to the Michigan Public Service Commission warned readers about utility influence on the commission. This concern materialized in December as the MPSC considered fast-tracking DTE’s Saline data center.

Then, this fall, as the data center phenomenon grew, we created a comprehensive guide to data centers in Michigan explaining what they are, how they impact communities, and how residents can engage in the approval process. We also produced a guide to the Michigan Public Service Commission, the state agency that regulates utilities and approves major energy projects, so residents understand how to participate in hearings and make their voices heard.

See all of our data center coverage.

Water infrastructure continues failing Detroit

When a major water main break flooded homes in Southwest Detroit in February, we documented the immediate crisis. But we didn’t stop there.

Our follow-up investigation revealed how climate change is compounding Detroit’s water infrastructure problems. “Weather whiplash” events cause pipes to undergo “thermal shock,” making them brittle and prone to catastrophic failure. The 1930s-era water main that burst, combined with increasingly volatile temperatures, creates a perfect storm for more frequent breaks.

This exemplifies our approach: breaking news coverage that captures immediate human impact, followed by investigative reporting that explains systemic forces at play.

Wyandotte’s water crisis: An investigation

Our deep dive into Wyandotte’s drinking water started with a single state report and evolved into months of accountability journalism that revealed immediate health risks and a decade-long deception.

In May, we reported state regulators found “significant deficiencies” in Wyandotte’s water system. The report revealed something else: Wyandotte had stopped fluoridating its drinking water — yet the city’s website still claimed it was doing so.

Our June reporting found that Wyandotte had quietly discontinued fluoridation in 2015 without alerting residents beyond its annual mandated water quality report, and only removed the misleading claim after our story. The city promised a fluoride plan by October, a full decade later.

We covered packed hearings where residents, dentists, and health experts urged officials to restore fluoridation. But when the vote came in October, commissioners voted 2-2, failing to restore it. “I have my reasons why; I don’t need to make a comment,” one commissioner told us.

This investigation exemplifies sustained accountability journalism: document-based reporting that exposes government failures, persistent follow-up through multiple hearings, and giving voice to residents who deserve transparency.

Holding polluters accountable: 3 fights for environmental justice

EES Coke: Our reporting from an EPA pollution trial — picked up by the Associated Press — tracked this Southwest Detroit polluter through courts and regulatory processes. When the EPA offered pollution exemptions and EES Coke applied, we were the only local newsroom reporting on what it means for residents breathing that air.

Aevitas: After a decade of odor complaints, a June fire finally sparked city action. We documented how the blaze, which took seven hours to control and injured a firefighter, revealed the facility’s impacts on Jefferson Chalmers and Marina District residents. Our analysis showed area odor complaints dropped 90% after Aevitas shut down. City Council passed an enforcement resolution, and a state regulator declared the facility’s air permit “obsolete.”

US Ecology: Our December reporting may mark a significant shift in how hazardous waste facilities are regulated in Detroit. The Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy ultimately renewed the facility’s permit despite years of community concerns, but added additional oversight aimed at odor control. We’re watching to see if this represents a real turning point in the state’s approach to industrial permitting.

Together, these stories demonstrate our relentless attention to industrial pollution. This sustained coverage holds polluters, regulators, and local officials accountable.

SERVICE: Making civic action easy

We believe journalism shouldn’t just inform people about problems. It should make civic action easy. That’s why we pair accountability reporting with practical tools, guides, and explainers that help residents take the next step. Whether you’re checking if your home has a lead pipe, understanding your energy bill, or learning how to file a complaint about air quality, we’re building the civic infrastructure Detroit and Michigan need.

Civic action boxes: From story to action

Every major accountability story includes a civic action box — a simple tool that answers “What can I do about this?” Whether it’s checking if your home has lead pipes, filing an air quality complaint, understanding your energy bill, or connecting with a community health worker, these boxes eliminate the friction between learning about a problem and taking concrete steps to address it. We don’t just want you informed: we want you equipped.

Data dashboards: Transparency you can use

Government agencies collect vast amounts of environmental and public health data, but accessing it often requires navigating clunky databases, filing public records requests, or decoding technical jargon. Planet Detroit does that work so you don’t have to. Our dashboards translate complex datasets into tools you can actually use to track progress, compare communities, and hold decision-makers accountable.

Michigan Lead Service Line Tracker – See which Michigan water systems have lead pipes and track replacement progress in your community. Built in partnership with Safe Water Engineering, this tool makes it easy to check if your home may have lead pipes and monitor local progress toward removal.

Michigan Air Permit Violations 2018-2024 – Track which facilities are violating their air pollution permits. This dashboard makes enforcement data accessible so communities can hold polluters and regulators accountable.

Guides and explainers paired with accountability stories

Every major investigation came with tools to help readers respond:

Data centers → Community guide to data centers and MPSC explainer

Water infrastructure failures → Lead pipe replacement checker

Air quality crises → Air quality guide and complaint filing instructions

Medical transport crisis → Resources for accessing health care

Community health → How to connect with local support

Electronics recycling → Where and how to properly dispose

Browse all service journalism

These aren’t add-ons to our reporting—they’re core to our mission. Information without action is just noise. We believe residents deserve both the truth about what’s happening and the tools to do something about it.

SOLUTIONS: Community-driven responses to challenges

We don’t just report problems, we spotlight the people and organizations building solutions. In 2025, our solutions journalism showed how communities are responding to environmental and health challenges with innovation, collaboration, and determination.

From food security to healthcare to habitat restoration

When federal SNAP delays left thousands of Michiganders hungry, we identified grassroots Detroit organizations that stepped up. It’s an example of how service journalism and community voices converge to reveal both problems and solutions.

Health care innovation came from unexpected sources. A volunteer-run clinic expanded its services to fill gaps in Detroit’s medical safety net. “It’s just a beautiful thing,” one provider told us.

Environmental restoration efforts took root along the Detroit River, where a local nonprofit began restoring wetland habitat on islands, actively reversing decades of degradation rather than simply documenting decline.

COMMUNITY VOICES: Residents telling their own stories

In 2025, our Neighborhood Reporting Lab continued to build on our belief that the best environmental journalism centers on the voices of people living closest to the issues. We trained Detroit residents to report on the health, climate, and community issues they see in their own neighborhoods, producing more than 30 stories that revealed the texture of environmental life in Detroit that no outsider could capture.

Community residents emerged as powerful storytellers, uplifting example after example of local leadership. Loretta Powell grows vegetables and neighbors together on Detroit’s east side, while Danny Dolley leads watershed restoration efforts in Chandler Park. Jason Ford’s work at Detroit People’s Food Co-op embodies his philosophy: “We gotta build the systems.” Erik Shelley’s journey in the fight for social justice shows him to be “someone you want on your side.”

Urban agriculture stories revealed the practical challenges and creative solutions. One Detroit farmer tackles water access to ensure “the plants will be watered fully and consistently.” Brittney Rooney grows food on Beaverland Farms and in the Brightmoor community. Dazmonique Carr works to improve Detroit’s food access, one produce box at a time.

Innovation took surprising forms. One Detroit woman turned a birthday tradition into a global upcycling movement — The Chip Bag Project even won a state grant. Detroit’s ReVamp clothing swaps make the world more sustainable, one party at a time. Detroit’s Architectural Salvage Warehouse proves that upcycled gems are everywhere.

Culture and sustainability intersect in unexpected places. Dominick Lemonious reimagines the art gallery at Detroit’s “Black Store.” Chi Fan Le brings authentic Chinese cuisine to Detroit’s pop-up scene. Sustain-A-City showed how Detroit reimagines sustainability through art.

Health and wellness stories captured movement and connection. We Walk Detroit builds health and community step by step in city parks — “therapeutic,” participants say. Black students sail the Detroit River with Harry Jones — “water is in my DNA,” he says. Socially Chrissy, Detroit’s bold biking mom, proves no car means no problem.

The Chandler Park Fieldhouse opened as an east side hub for health, hope, and community. Meanwhile, Detroiters described the citywide struggle with truck traffic: “Our streets are sinking.”

These stories don’t just inform, they honor the lived expertise of Detroit residents, celebrate community-led solutions, and build connections between neighbors working on similar challenges. The Neighborhood Reporting Lab proves that environmental journalism is most powerful when communities tell their own stories.
