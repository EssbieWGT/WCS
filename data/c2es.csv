The EPA found the permit failed to assure adequate monitoring of particulate matter air pollution, failed to establish enforceable pollution limits, failed to ensure adequate monitoring of emission control systems, and failed to ensure the Hermosa mine complied with federal air quality regulations.
The Arizona Department of Environmental Quality was ordered to revise the permit to comply with the Clean Air Act.
Despite widespread opposition, the state approved the Hermosa mine’s air pollution permit last August.

The EPA’s May 30 ruling found the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality failed to comply with the Clean Air Act when approving a permit for the multinational mining company, South32, to build and operate the Hermosa heavy metals mine. The order issued on May 30 follows a legal petition filed by the Center for Biological Diversity, Patagonia Area Resource Alliance, and other groups.

“The Arizona Department of Environmental Quality threw clean air and a healthy environment under the bus when approving the Hermosa mine’s air pollution permit,” said Jeremy Nichols, a senior advocate at the Center. “Thankfully the Clean Air Act is still working and holding the mining industry accountable for protecting air quality and communities.”

The Hermosa mine threatens to release hundreds of tons of toxic air pollution every year, putting clean air, biodiversity and the health of nearby communities at risk.

The EPA found the permit failed to assure adequate monitoring of particulate matter air pollution, failed to establish enforceable pollution limits, failed to ensure adequate monitoring of emission control systems, and failed to ensure the Hermosa mine complied with federal air quality regulations.

The Arizona Department of Environmental Quality was ordered to revise the permit to comply with the Clean Air Act.

“It’s outrageous the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality’s permit did not rise to the stated mission of the agency, which is to protect and enhance public health and the environment in Arizona,” said Carolyn Shafer with the Patagonia Area Resource Alliance. “This permit should never have been issued in the first place. The EPA’s ruling confirms how misguided the Hermosa mine is.”

The mine would be dug into the Patagonia Mountains, a biodiversity hotspot and a drinking water source for Santa Cruz County. It would be located only five miles from the town of Patagonia, a community sustained by local businesses and ecotourism.

Despite widespread opposition, the state approved the Hermosa mine’s air pollution permit last August.

In a petition filed in September, a coalition of health and environmental groups requested that the EPA object to the air pollution permit for the Hermosa mine.

The Arizona Department of Environmental Quality now has 90 days to fix the permit, or the EPA will be required to take it over and potentially deny it.",https://www.biologicaldiversity.org/news/press_releases/images/center-frog-logo-300.jpg,N,,2025-06-02 13:15:47.400725

The legislation aims to make permanent the expiring tax provisions of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act while rolling back key elements of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), with clean energy tax credits taking a bigger hit than many had anticipated. Despite early signs of potential bipartisan concern — most notably a letter from 21 House Republicans expressing reservations about undermining energy incentives — support for clean energy did not materialize when it counted. The House action comes amid a flurry of activity across the executive branch, with President Trump issuing a series of executive orders to bolster the US nuclear sector and federal agency leaders laying out plans to reshape energy and environmental programs. As the bill moves to the Senate, where internal GOP divisions are already surfacing, it’s unclear whether the more aggressive provisions will stick if the Senate opts for a more moderate path, leaving the broader Republican energy and budget agenda facing a critical political test.

Reconciliation Package Passes Through the House

On May 22, the House narrowly passed its reconciliation bill in a 215-214 vote, with one member abstaining. The legislation seeks to make permanent the lower tax rates established by the Republicans’ 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which are set to expire at the end of this year. What advanced was an amended package consolidating 11 separate bills previously approved by their respective committees. Notably, the measure includes significant revisions to tax provisions tied to the Inflation Reduction Act.

Clean Electricity ITC and PTC: For those wishing to utilize the clean electricity production tax credit (45Y) and investment tax credit (48E), projects must begin construction within 60 days of the legislation’s enactment. Additionally, to maintain eligibility to receive the tax credits, the projects must be operational by December 31, 2028. This is an accelerated timeline from the one originally proposed by the House Ways and Means Committee version of the bill, which had set a 2031 deadline. Projects failing to meet these requirements would no longer be eligible for the credits.

Foreign Entities of Concern (FEOC) Restrictions are now applied to these credits. After enactment of the legislation, the credit user cannot be a specified foreign entity. One year after enactment, facilities that begin construction cannot receive material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity. Two years after enactment, the credit user cannot be a foreign-influenced entity or make an applicable payment to a prohibited foreign entity.

Immediate Elimination of these credits for solar or wind residential or rural leases.

Nuclear Carveout: Eligible advanced nuclear facilities and expanded nuclear facilities are exempted from the 60-day beginning-of-construction requirements and instead must only comply with the placed-in-service deadline on December 31, 2028.

Nuclear Power Production Credit: For 45U, the credit expires at the end of 2031.

Advanced Manufacturing Tax Credit: For 45X, production occurring after 2031 will now no longer qualify — one year earlier than current law. In addition, under the legislation, wind-energy components cease to be eligible after 2027 — five years earlier than the IRA intended.

Clean Fuel Production Credit: For 45Z, the credit’s life is extended from 2028 to 2031. Under the legislation, feedstock must be sourced exclusively from the United States, Canada, or Mexico. Credits are denied if the producer becomes a prohibited foreign entity or foreign-influenced entity.

Carbon Sequestrating Credit: For 45Q, the credit is maintained as originally written in the IRA, remaining until 2032.

Clean Hydrogen Production Tax Credit: 45V is eliminated for new projects beginning after December 31, 2025.

Electric Vehicles Credits: The Clean Vehicle Credit (30D), Used Clean Vehicle Credit (25E), Alternative Fuel Vehicle Refueling Property Credit (30C), and Qualified Commercial Clean Vehicle Credit (45W) are all eliminated for new projects beginning after December 31, 2025.

Energy Efficiency Credits: The Energy Efficient Home Improvement Tax Credit (25C), Residential Clean Energy Property Credit (25D), and Energy Efficient New Homes Tax Credit for Home Builders (45L) are all eliminated for new projects beginning after December 31, 2025.

For all the credits listed above — except the Clean Electricity ITC and PTC, which have their own, more-stringent requirements — the following FOEC restrictions now apply: After enactment, the credit user cannot be a specified foreign entity. Two years after enactment, the credit user also cannot be a foreign-influenced entity — defined by if, during the taxable year, a specified foreign entity has the authority to appoint a board member, executive officer, or similar individual; if a single specified foreign entity owns at least 10% of the entity; if multiple specified foreign entities collectively own 25% or more of the entity; or if they together hold 25% or more of its debt. Furthermore, an entity will also be considered foreign-influenced if, during the prior taxable year, it knowingly, or should have known it, made payments — such as dividends, interest, compensation for services, rents, royalties, guarantees, or other fixed and periodic payments — either amounting to 10% or more of such payments to a single specified foreign entity or 25% or more in total to multiple specified foreign entities.

Beyond tax measures, the bill claws back unobligated IRA funds from both the Department of Energy (DOE) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Specifically, the bill eliminates unused IRA credit subsidy funding, which is a key source of funding for the Loan Programs Office (LPO). While the bill preserves existing loan authority, the rescission of the credit subsidy could have significant implications for the LPO’s ability to administer its programs. It also removes a previously included — and controversial — provision that would have allowed the sale of small public land tracts in Utah and Nevada for development.

The legislation now heads to the Senate, where significant changes are expected. Republican leaders aim to pass the bill before the July 4 recess, though procedural and political hurdles could delay action beyond the mid-August deadline, which is tied to the recent $4 trillion increase in the federal debt ceiling.

With a 53-47 majority, Senate Republicans need at least 51 votes to pass the measure. However, several GOP senators have already expressed concerns. Senators Thom Tillis (R-NC), Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), John Curtis (R-Utah), and Jerry Moran (R-Kan.) have criticized the House bill’s rollback of IRA tax credits as too aggressive. Others, including Senators Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Susan Collins (R-Maine), oppose the bill’s proposed Medicaid cuts and have publicly stated they have “Medicaid red lines” they won’t cross. On the opposite end, Senators Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), Rick Scott (R-Fla.), Mike Lee (R-Utah), and Rand Paul (R-Ky.) argue the bill doesn’t go far enough in addressing deficit reduction, signaling that Senate Republicans must navigate divisions from both moderates and fiscal hardliners.

Trump’s Executive Orders on Nuclear

On May 23, President Trump announced four Executive Orders (EOs) aimed at boosting the nuclear industry:

“Deploying Advanced Nuclear Reactor Technologies for National Security” mandates the acceleration of development and use of advanced nuclear technologies by the federal government, including establishing a program for the use of nuclear energy at military installations and directing the DOE to designate sites for deploying these reactors.

“Reforming Nuclear Reactor Testing at the Department of Energy” mandates the DOE to expedite the testing and deployment of advanced reactors through streamlined processes at National Laboratories and a new pilot program outside of them, with a focus on reaching operational status for qualified test reactors and at least three pilot program reactors within specific deadlines. Furthermore, the order requires the DOE to reform its environmental review procedures under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) to remove barriers to reactor development.

“Reinvigorating the Nuclear Industrial Base” emphasizes the critical need to address challenges like foreign dominance in nuclear reactor designs and a reliance on external sources for nuclear fuel. The order directs the Secretary of Energy to use the authority provided by the Defense Production Act (DPA) to seek voluntary agreements with domestic nuclear energy companies. These agreements are intended to facilitate cooperative procurement of LEU and HALEU and allow consultation to enhance spent nuclear fuel management (including recycling and reprocessing), ensure the availability of the nuclear fuel supply chain capacity, and expand the nuclear energy workforce.

“Ordering the Reform of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission” directs the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to reorganize to “promote the expeditious processing of license applications and the adoption of innovative technology.” A dedicated team of at least 20 officials will be created to draft new regulations.

Not all of this will ultimately prove realistic. For instance, the Trump administration called for 20 new Section 123 Agreements for Peaceful Nuclear Cooperation by 2028 when only 25 have been signed since 1954. The administration also set a goal of 10 new large reactors with complete designs under construction by 2030, when only two have been done in the last 40 years. Still these four EOs clearly shine a light on the administration’s goals for nuclear and the potential for revitalizing this industry.

Agency Updates

Trump’s recent executive actions align with statements made by Secretary of Energy Chris Wright during a DOE budget oversight hearing. Wright emphasized his strong support for using the DOE’s Loan Programs Office to accelerate the deployment of nuclear energy projects. He also highlighted his top priorities, which include advancing US artificial intelligence capabilities, supporting the emerging geothermal industry, and streamlining the approval process for oil, gas, and coal projects. However, on May 15, the DOE announced that it would be reviewing 179 individual awards totaling over $15 billion, starting with those at the LPO, an initiative that may run counter to Secretary Wright’s comments about using the LPO for nuclear.

During budget oversight hearings before both the House and Senate, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin faced sharp questioning from lawmakers. Following President Trump’s “skinny budget request,” Zeldin announced plans to eliminate the EPA’s Office of Atmospheric Protection — which oversees the Energy Star program — as well as the Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards. In their place, the agency will establish two new offices within the Office of Air and Radiation: the Office of Clean Air Programs and the Office of State Air Partnerships. When pressed about the future of Energy Star, Zeldin stated he is in discussions with several private entities to take over the program, arguing that since it is not mandated by Congress, the EPA has the authority to transfer its management. However, the privatization of the Energy Star program would still likely require congressional authorization.

Meanwhile, the confirmation process for key positions across federal agencies continues to progress. In May, several appointments were finalized.

At the DOE, the following were advanced out of the Senate committees: Jonathan Brightbill to be General Counsel, Tina Pierce to be Chief Financial Officer, Wells Griffith to be Undersecretary, Brandon Williams to be Undersecretary for Nuclear Security / Administrator for Nuclear Security, Dario Gil to be Undersecretary for Science, Kyle Haustveit to be Assistant Secretary for Fossil Energy and Carbon Management, Ted Garrish to be Assistant Secretary for Nuclear Energy, Tristan Abbey to be Administrator of the US Energy Information Administration, Matthew Napoli to be Deputy Administrator for Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation, Scott Pappano to be Principal Deputy Administrator of the National Nuclear Security Administration, Conner Prochaska to be Director of the Advanced Research Projects Agency – Energy, and Catherine Jereza to be Assistant Secretary of Electricity. Timothy Walsh has been nominated for Assistant Secretary of Environmental Management and Audrey Robertson has been nominated for Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy.

At the EPA, Jeffrey Hall was nominated to be Assistant Administrator for Enforcement and Compliance Assurance, and John Busterud to be Assistant Administrator, Office of Solid Waste.

For Interior, nominations for Ned Mamula to be Director, US Geological Survey, Brian Nesvik to be Director, US Fish and Wildlife Service, Andrea Travnicek to be Assistant Secretary for Water and Science, Leslie Beyer to be Assistant Secretary for Land and Minerals Management, and William L.

The Eddystone Generating Station, located just south of Philadelphia on the Delaware River, is owned and operated by Constellation Energy.
The site’s original coal-fired supercritical units, Units 1 and 2, were retired in 2011 and 2012.
Third Major Federal Intervention The Eddystone order marks the Trump administration’s third major federal intervention in U.S. power markets.
This emergency order helps keep money in consumers’ pockets while keeping their homes and businesses fully powered.","The Department of Energy (DOE) has issued its third Section 202(c) emergency order in the past two weeks, this time to bolster reliability in PJM Interconnection by compelling Constellation Energy to keep Units 3 and 4 of its dual-fuel Eddystone Generating Station in Pennsylvania open beyond their scheduled retirement date of May 31, 2025.

The May 30-issued directive, another rare and significant federal intervention, aims to address acute resource adequacy concerns within PJM’s territory, which spans 13 states and the District of Columbia.

The DOE’s order states that PJM shall, in coordination with Constellation Energy, run specified units at the Eddystone Generating Station when PJM deems necessary, past their planned retirement date of May 31, 2025. While it expires on Aug. 28, 2025, the order essentially declares that “emergency exists in portions of the electricity grid” operated by PJM “due to a shortage of facilities for the generation of electric energy, resource adequacy concerns, and other causes, and that issuance of this Order will meet the emergency and serve the public interest.”

PJM Supportive of the Directive

In a statement sent to POWER on May 31, PJM expressed support for the directive, calling it “a prudent, term-limited step that will retain the covered generators for a 90-day period.” Over the past two years, “PJM has repeatedly documented and voiced its concerns over the growing risk of a supply and demand imbalance driven by the confluence of generator retirements and demand growth,” the grid operator said. The order will allow DOE, Constellation Energy, and PJM “to undertake further analysis regarding the longer-term need and viability of these generators,” it said.

The Eddystone Generating Station, located just south of Philadelphia on the Delaware River, is owned and operated by Constellation Energy. The facility’s six units have a combined nameplate capacity of 820 MW. Units 3 and 4—commissioned in the late 1960s and early 1970s—are each 380 MW subcritical steam turbine units that can operate on natural gas or oil, but the plant also includes four smaller oil-fired peaking units (Units 10, 20, 30, and 40) totaling 60 MW. The site’s original coal-fired supercritical units, Units 1 and 2, were retired in 2011 and 2012. Historically, Units 3 and 4 have provided valuable flexibility to PJM during periods of fuel price volatility or supply constraints.

Constellation formally moved to retire Eddystone Units 3 and 4 with a deactivation notice to PJM in December 2023, citing economic pressures and its broader shift toward a cleaner generating portfolio. In a February 2024 letter, PJM noted it did not identify reliability violations from the proposed retirement, and it granted Constellation the green light to push forward with its announced May 2025 retirement.

However, in December 2024, PJM proposed changes to its tariff under a new Reliability Resource Initiative (RRI), citing near-term resource adequacy concerns. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) approved the revisions in February 2025, acknowledging “the possibility of a resource adequacy shortfall driven by significant load growth, premature retirements, and delayed new entry.”

PJM has in recent months repeatedly flagged that it is facing an urgent supply-demand dilemma compounded by surging power demand from electrification, data centers, and onshoring manufacturing. In January, the grid operator acknowledged a capacity shortage could affect its system as early as the 2026/2027 delivery year. As POWER has reported, the PJM expects its summer peak to climb about 70,000 MW to 220,000 MW over the next 15 years, while winter peaks are estimated at 210,000 MW by 2039. PJM, however, is also bracing for 40 GW of retirements by 2030, 60% of which is coal and 40% natural gas-fired.

The DOE’s order compels PJM and Constellation to take “all measures necessary” to ensure that the Eddystone units “are available to operate. Until August, “PJM is directed to take every step to employ economic dispatch of the units to minimize cost to ratepayers,” it states. “Constellation Energy is directed to comply with all orders from PJM related to the availability and dispatch of the Eddystone Units.”

Both entities will need to file any necessary tariff revisions or waivers at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to recover costs associated with the emergency operation, as allowed under federal law.

The order, notably, restricts operation to “the times and within the parameters determined by PJM for reliability purposes,” and mandates that all operations comply with environmental requirements “to the maximum extent feasible while operating consistent with the emergency conditions.” It also requires PJM to provide daily notifications regarding the units operation and compliance, and it will require PJM to submit, by June 15, a detailed report on steps taken to ensure operational availability and minimize environmental impact.

Third Major Federal Intervention

The Eddystone order marks the Trump administration’s third major federal intervention in U.S. power markets. On May 16, the DOE issued two emergency orders to the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA) following a full island-wide blackout and warnings that the grid could face up to 135 days of forced load shedding this summer. The orders required PREPA to dispatch more than 30 fossil-fueled generation units—including some mothballed assets—and accelerate vegetation management along key transmission corridors. The DOE found that “any major generation unit anywhere on the island would result in significant numbers of Puerto Ricans losing access to power,” and mandated 90-day emergency measures to stabilize the grid.

A week later, on May 23, the DOE ordered the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) and Consumers Energy to keep the 1,560-MW J.H. Campbell coal plant in Michigan available for operation through the summer, overriding a planned May 31 closure. That order cited the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC)’s 2025 Summer Reliability Assessment, which warned of “elevated risk of operating reserve shortfalls” in the Midwest, owing to the retirement of thermal generation and reduced solar output. The Campbell order, like Eddystone, required economic dispatch, daily reporting, and compliance with environmental laws to the maximum extent practicable.

The measures reflect an aggressive posture by the DOE, which says it is acting in accordance with President Trump’s January 2025 declaration of a national energy emergency. Most recent 202(c) emergency orders have responded to active grid emergencies like hurricanes or extreme weather and focused on short-term generation dispatch actions.

“Maintaining access to affordable, reliable, and secure power is always our top priority, particularly during the summer months when electricity demand reaches its peak,” said U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright on Friday. “Americans should never be left wondering whether they will be able to turn on their lights or air conditioning. This emergency order helps keep money in consumers’ pockets while keeping their homes and businesses fully powered. Energy shortfalls or unnecessary price increases are not options in this Administration.”

However, critics—including environmental groups and some consumer advocates—argue that the order amounts to a bailout for uneconomic, aging fossil-fueled plants.

“Trump’s last minute emergency order—issued literally on the last day these power plants were set to operate—causes significant, expensive complications,” said Tyson Slocum, director of Public Citizen’s Energy Program. “Old units like Eddystone require both minor and major maintenance—maintenance that was deferred because of its planned retirement on May 31. Extending the life of the unit will force ratepayers to shell out money to cover expensive maintenance and overpay for expensive power that will result in American households paying even higher electricity bills, as Trump’s emergency order requires consumers to pay 100% of all costs to get the plant up and running, including a guaranteed profit for Constellation.”",https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/eddystone-2-constellation.jpeg,N,,2025-06-02 13:15:24.507396

When directed at radioactive waste inside a nuclear reactor, these neutrons multiply and can transform radioactive waste into less harmful materials.","Two projects led by researchers at the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) Argonne National Laboratory have been awarded just over $10 million from the DOE’s Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E). The funding is part of the Nuclear Energy Waste Transmutation Optimized Now (NEWTON) program, which aims to make the conversion of U.S. commercial used nuclear fuel (UNF) economically viable within 30 years.

Transmutation technologies can significantly reduce the mass, volume, activity and lifespan of UNF by converting long-living hazardous isotopes into materials that decay more quickly. This reduces the duration needed for long-term storage and improves overall economy and safety of operations.

“We are incredibly proud of this planned transformational work in nuclear waste transmutation, which has earned well-deserved recognition and support from the DOE’s NEWTON program,” said Temitope Taiwo, director of Nuclear Science and Engineering at Argonne. ​“The innovative approach positions Argonne at the forefront of sustainable nuclear technology solutions.”

“I am very excited to receive funding from the NEWTON program to advance this brand-new technology. This method uses physics-based separation instead of conventional chemical separations, making it a separation technology that is more secure.” — Taek K. Kim, Argonne senior nuclear engineer

The first Argonne project was awarded $7 million and is led by Taek K. Kim, a senior nuclear engineer and manager of Nuclear Systems Analysis. The project, titled ​“Liquid Lead Suspended Fuel Subcritical Fission Blanket for Nuclear Waste Transmutation,” focuses on a new type of transmutation process. It also uses innovative separation methods — centrifugal force — to remove the waste by-products from the process. Fission is the process of splitting an atomic nucleus into two or more smaller nuclei, releasing a large amount of energy.

The project aims to transmute the entire U.S. stockpile of minor actinides within 30 years, reducing the nuclear fuel mass by 28 times, which is roughly equivalent to shrinking a large swimming pool filled with used fuel down to the size of a small hot tub. It will also decrease radiotoxicity management time 333-fold.

“I am very excited to receive funding from the NEWTON program to advance this brand-new technology,” said Kim. ​“This method uses physics-based separation instead of conventional chemical separations such as PUREX, making it a separation technology that is more secure and more difficult to use for nefarious purposes.”

The proposed transmutation system uses a proton accelerator to start fission in a liquid lead setup containing tiny minor actinide particles — the heavy, radioactive elements near the bottom of the periodic table. As the minor actinide particles fission, the two new smaller nuclei are ejected from the particle and can be separated from the actinide particles by centrifugal methods in a recycling system.

More technical details about the project are available on the ARPA-E website.

Argonne’s second NEWTON award-winning project is in partnership with DOE’s Fermilab National Accelerator Laboratory. Michael Kelly, an accelerator physicist in Argonne’s Physical Science and Engineering directorate, leads the project, ​“Nb3Sn Proton Driver Linac for Accelerator Driven Systems.” The project is focused on developing advanced superconducting cavities used in particle accelerators.

Particle accelerators could play a significant role in the management of the 90,000 metric tons of UNF at U.S. nuclear plants. Made from materials that conduct electricity without resistance when cooled to very low temperatures, superconducting cavities are specialized components stacked together in particle accelerators to efficiently propel charged particles, like protons, to high speeds.

An accelerated proton beam can generate an intense flux of neutrons, uncharged subatomic particles that are useful for probing materials at the atomic scale. When directed at radioactive waste inside a nuclear reactor, these neutrons multiply and can transform radioactive waste into less harmful materials. The team is developing advanced superconducting cavities using a thin film of niobium-tin (Nb3Sn) to reduce the size and cost of accelerators while improving their reliability and efficiency.

Between both projects, Argonne scientists are working on the most critical pieces of making transmutation a reality: the accelerator and proton beam, as well as the target and reactor.",https://www.anl.gov/sites/www/files/2025-05/34258D_0570_NTNS_Controlled%20Centrifugal%20Contactor%20Technology_WEB_16x9.jpg,N,,2025-06-02 13:15:31.618490

Most of these projects focus on carbon capture and decarbonization. The DOE said this decision followed a review. It found weak execution plans, unclear goals, and limited national security or economic benefits.

Secretary David Wright confirmed this news by saying,

“While the previous administration failed to conduct a thorough financial review before signing away billions of taxpayer dollars, the Trump administration is doing our due diligence to ensure we are utilizing taxpayer dollars to strengthen our national security, bolster affordable, reliable energy sources and advance projects that generate the highest possible return on investment. Today, we are acting in the best interest of the American people by cancelling these 24 awards.”

Why DOE Scrapped Billions in Projects Signed Before Inauguration?

The press release notes that 16 of these projects—nearly 70%—were approved between Election Day and January 20. Most focused on carbon capture and decarbonization technologies.

Wright said the prior administration rushed these deals without proper financial vetting. In contrast, the current DOE leadership conducted a detailed review to ensure public funds are used wisely.

He pressed on the fact that,

“These decisions protect national security, ensure energy reliability, and prioritize high-return investments.”

Earlier this month, DOE issued a memorandum titled “Ensuring Responsibility for Financial Assistance,” outlining strict review standards. The canceled projects failed to meet key criteria—economic value, energy security, and national interest—leading to their termination under this revised oversight policy.

Heavy Industry and CCS Take the Hardest Hit

The cancellations mainly impact big carbon capture projects in cement and industry. A media report highlighted the major losses industries suffered due to the canceled projects.

Heidelberg Materials: $500 million canceled

National Cement Co. of California: $500 million canceled

Brimstone Energy: $189 million canceled

Sublime Systems: $87 million canceled

Calpine’s Baytown project: $270 million canceled

ExxonMobil’s Texas hydrogen shift plan: $332 million canceled

Wyoming carbon capture pilot: $49 million canceled

Many companies expressed disappointment and confusion. Brimstone Energy believes its project was misunderstood, despite its alignment with U.S. critical mineral goals. ExxonMobil declined to comment, while Heidelberg is considering an appeal.

These projects aimed to cut industrial CO₂ emissions and aid low-income, high-pollution communities. Losing them means emission-heavy sectors lose vital tools for transition, especially since some processes, like cement production, can’t easily switch to renewables.

Market Reaction: A Blow to Investor Confidence

The cancellation signals that U.S. federal support for carbon capture may not be guaranteed anymore. This worries clean tech investors and developers who rely on long-term government backing for costly, high-risk projects.

Now, companies might turn to:

Private equity

Green bonds

International funding partnerships

Academic collaborations

However, these options often lack the scale and speed of federal aid. Industry leaders fear this move could slow U.S. innovation, especially as Europe and Asia ramp up funding for decarbonization technologies.

Jessie Stolark from the Carbon Capture Coalition expressed disappointment over this decision. She said,

“Today, the cancellation of 24 DOE-funded projects, many of them carbon capture related, is a major step backward in the nationwide deployment of carbon management technologies. It is hugely disappointing to see these projects canceled – projects that had already progressed through a rigorous, months-long review process by technical experts at DOE.”

“Further development and deployment of carbon management technologies is crucial to meeting America’s growing demand for affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy. To be clear, ensuring projects funded by the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act move forward toward commercialization are necessary to demonstrate the technology across fossil fuel power generation and key industrial sectors, including natural gas-fired power generation, cement, and basic chemicals.”

Climate Goals at Risk Without CCS Support

The DOE’s reversal may hinder U.S. climate goals. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is vital for decarbonizing cement, steel, and fossil fuel power plants. Without these technologies, emissions from these industries may continue unchecked.

Moreover, many canceled projects were in areas heavily affected by pollution. Their loss means those communities may face ongoing poor air quality and health risks.

Environmental advocates argue that the DOE’s cost-saving approach could lead to larger climate costs later. Reducing carbon capture efforts now could impede the U.S. from meeting its emissions targets under global agreements.

Fuelling the resistance, Congresswoman Marcy Kaptur said,

“The abrupt termination of $3.7 Billion in clean energy investment is shortsighted and malicious. This decision will raise energy costs for American families and undermine our nation’s competitive edge. In Northwest Ohio, it endangers jobs, and undermines manufacturing in our critical glass industry, while empowering China and our global competitors. Nationwide, DOE is not only raising the cost of energy in Red Districts and Blue Districts — we’re ceding ground to global competitors racing ahead in innovation and energy efficiency.”

“This decision undercuts American innovation, discourages private-sector investment, and harms workers like the ones I represent who are counting on these projects for jobs and economic revitalization. The American people deserve leadership that meets the moment — not one that backs away from the challenge of a clean, affordable energy future. If the Trump Administration was looking to give Communist China everything they wanted, they are well on their way.”

What’s Next: A Policy Reset for Clean Energy Funding

Moving forward, the DOE is likely to set higher standards for federal clean energy grants. Projects will need to show strong environmental potential along with:

Economic viability

Realistic timelines

National security value

Clean energy still has bipartisan support across many U.S. regions. Yet, the path to funding may now involve stricter standards and accountability.

This gap could attract more private and foreign investment. However, scaling solutions without federal support will be tough. The big question is: Can the U.S. remain a global leader in climate tech while limiting funding for transformative projects?",https://carboncredits.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/flux_DOE-Cancels-3.7B-Clean-Energy-Grants-Due-to-Viability-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-06-02 13:15:35.760228

But that undermines one of TVA’s main arguments for building new gas plants in the first place: its self-determined deadline for coal retirement.
“The imperative of 2027 closure of the [Kingston coal plant] is not adequately disclosed.
That coal plant is the largest in the fleet, providing a capacity of roughly 2.4 GW.
TVA plans to add a nearly 1.5-GW gas plant on site and a 0.9-GW gas plant in Cheatham County, about 20 miles from Nashville.","The Tennessee Valley Authority is considering extending the life of its coal plants.

Or, at least, that is what the utility is saying publicly.

“TVA is very concerned about how they are being viewed by the Trump administration,” said Stephen Smith, director of the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy.

TVA currently operates four coal plants: Kingston, near Knoxville, Cumberland, near Clarksville, Gallatin, about 30 miles from Nashville, and Shawnee, in Paducah, Kentucky.

In 2021, TVA announced a plan to retire all coal plants by 2035. Two of the coal plants, at Kingston and Cumberland, are scheduled to close completely by 2027 and 2028, respectively, and be replaced with equivalent gas generation.

“Substantial performance and cost risk is carried by operating a coal fleet reaching the end of its useful life,” TVA wrote at the time. “Unplanned outage rate, a component of availability, is the primary driver of challenges.” Many Tennesseans experienced this firsthand during Winter Storm Elliott two years ago, when TVA issued rolling blackouts after coal and gas plants failed.

But earlier this month, TVA changed its tune, shortly after President Donald Trump signed executive orders aimed at reviving the coal industry and granted TVA exemptions to Biden-era coal pollution regulations.

“We’re evaluating our coal units’ lifespans,” TVA’s new CEO Don Moul said during a recent board meeting. “We continue to depend on them to help power this region.”

Moul declined an interview request from WPLN News about the possible extensions. Wade White, a member of the TVA Board, the utility’s main regulator, also declined an interview with WPLN News at a meeting in early May.

TVA undermines one of its key arguments for new fossil fuel generation

TVA may find it difficult to extend use of the Kingston or Cumberland coal plants, because the utility would have to get permission to emit two kinds of dangerous fossil fuel pollution simultaneously, as new gas plants at those sites come online. All four of the utility’s coal plants rank among the top five climate polluters in Tennessee and Kentucky — with Cumberland consistently ranking as the top emitter. Air pollution from these plants is also linked to hundreds of premature deaths each year.

Or TVA could burn coal longer if any gas plant construction gets behind schedule. But that undermines one of TVA’s main arguments for building new gas plants in the first place: its self-determined deadline for coal retirement.

When proposing a 1.5-gigawatt gas plant for Kingston, for example, TVA suggested that the gas plant was the only option for generation because of how quickly it needed to shut down the coal plant — an argument scrutinized by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency last year.

“TVA dismisses the lower costs, lower financial risks, and far superior environmental performance of [the solar option] by arguing that solar cells could not be installed by 2027,” EPA wrote in a letter to the utility. “The imperative of 2027 closure of the [Kingston coal plant] is not adequately disclosed. If closure by 2027 is an imperative, then TVA created an alternative that is technically infeasible and therefore not a viable alternative.”

More: In Tennessee, who uses the most fracked gas? | WPLN News

TVA’s own transmission queue challenges this idea. As of January 2025, the utility had about 8.6 GW worth of solar and battery projects, with requested dates of June 2025 or later, waiting to be developed and added to the grid. That is more power than TVA’s entire gas buildout this decade.

Last year, TVA said it takes an average of “5.4 years” for a solar project to come online, but experts say TVA could speed up the rate at which it’s bringing solar projects online.

“If TVA had the proper ambition and motivation, they could be building out solar and storage to scale,” Smith said. “They choose not to, and they choose then to mislead the public that it’s not possible.”

TVA made a similar argument for the Cumberland site a few years ago. That coal plant is the largest in the fleet, providing a capacity of roughly 2.4 GW. TVA plans to add a nearly 1.5-GW gas plant on site and a 0.9-GW gas plant in Cheatham County, about 20 miles from Nashville.

TVA stressed the need to have replacement generation by 2026 to replace the first of the coal plant’s two units.

“If the first Cumberland unit must stay in operation beyond 2026, significant investment would be required to maintain safe and reliable operations and comply with environmental regulations,” TVA wrote in an environmental review. “Operation beyond 2026 would also inject operational risk back into the TVA system due to the deteriorating condition of the coal units.”

So, why would TVA now say it is considering keeping its coal plants running longer?

The U.S. ‘national energy emergency’

President Donald Trump declared a “national energy emergency” on his first day in office.

This was not an effort to mitigate the climate crisis. The Trump administration purged those words from government websites, and reduced or cut scientific reports, data tools like the “billion-dollar disasters” database, and scientists from the federal workforce.

The Senate will also soon consider the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” which would repeal tax credits for clean energy development in the nation’s first big climate law — which has a special provision for the Tennessee Valley Authority — and incentives for consumer purchases on items like electric vehicles and solar water heaters. The new bill threatens the national trend: Solar, wind and batteries were forecasted to make up 93% of new electric generation this year. (However, that isn’t the Tennessee trend.)

Trump instead wants to boost fossil fuel production. Many of his executive orders aim to expedite oil and gas projects and reduce regulations on pollution.

For context, the U.S. became the world’s largest producer of gas in 2011, surpassing Russia, and the largest producer of oil in 2018, surpassing Saudi Arabia. The nation reached record fossil fuel production under Biden. Some scientists and environmentalists say the U.S. is now, under Trump, a “petrostate.”

Trump also wants to salvage the declining coal industry, which may partially explain TVA’s willingness to open the conversation on extensions.

“Much of this is a political discussion that TVA is having publicly to send a signal to the Trump administration that they’re responding to some of Trump’s desires,” Smith, the director, said.

Coal use has been waning for over a decade, largely due to cheaper options like gas and renewables. Nearly all coal plants in the U.S. are more expensive to run than the cost of building renewable replacements, according to a 2023 study by Energy Innovation, without factoring in tax credits or environmental regulations.

More coal was retired during Trump’s first administration than during the Biden presidency or Obama’s second term.

Although coal remains the dirtiest fuel for energy, Smith said, Trump has created a pathway for delays.

“We’re seeing lots of things starting to slip in the wrong direction,” Smith said. “The environment doesn’t care about politics. The physics are going to happen, and that’s what we’re most worried about.”",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/44d54f9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1024x538+0+115/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F90%2F9e%2F76c757874eab8585152c283ed1df%2Fcumberland-tva-1024x768.jpg,N,,2025-06-02 13:16:13.997522

The policy brief highlighting these technologies can be found here.

The United States has emerged as the global standard for the private fusion energy sector, with multiple fusion developers building toward deployment in the early-to-mid 2030s. The Trump administration has recognized the importance of sources of nuclear energy to ensure “America leads both in energy production and environmental innovation.” However, the House recently passed legislation that would be detrimental to the future of U.S. leadership in fusion energy and stifle American innovation.

Despite these setbacks, there are still opportunities for the administration and Congress to maintain – and even further – the United States’ position as a leader in fusion energy. To do so, it will require federal policy action across the value chain, including the preservation and enhancement of technology neutral tax credits, closing science and technology gaps required for commercial fusion energy deployment, and the continuation of essential public-private partnership programs. Investing in fusion energy now is key to unlocking its huge energy potential and maintaining U.S. fusion energy leadership. Failing to do so will allow global competitors to seize the opportunity to dominate the future of energy.

Fusion energy can bolster American innovation and support U.S. leadership.

Fusion, the power of the stars, is the process by which lighter atomic nuclei, such as hydrogen, merge to form a heavier nucleus, releasing energy. Commercial deployment of fusion energy could secure permanent U.S. energy independence, stabilize low-carbon grids with firm, clean power, promote energy addition to support growing power needs, and drive economic growth.

Today, the U.S. private fusion energy industry counts 25 verified companies which have secured over $6 billion in private funding, most of which aim to put fusion energy watts on the grid in the 2030s. Today, multiple U.S. fusion companies are preparing concrete plans to do so.

Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS) is partnering with the utility Dominion Energy to build its ARC plant, which will be sited in Chesterfield County, Virginia, with plans for grid connection in the early 2030s.

Helion Energy is conducting a feasibility study at Chelan County Public Utility District in Malaga, Washington, to build a 50 MW power plant near Rock Island Dam, which would fulfil a Power Purchase Agreement the company has with Microsoft.

Type One Energy has entered a Cooperative Agreement with the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) to jointly develop plans for Infinity Two, a 350 MWe stellarator fusion power plant targeted for the mid-2030s.

The success of these projects is essential to securing U.S. fusion energy leadership. Sustained federal support and policy certainty are necessary to ensure they reach commercial deployment.

Commercializing fusion energy will take federal support to close the science and technology gaps, including funding for demonstration projects and federal tax credits.

Congress must preserve, amend, and expand clean energy tax credits. The 48E investment tax credit and 45Y production tax credit are central to the business cases of fusion energy companies. These provisions help overcome the “missing middle” investment gap common to breakthrough innovation sectors like fusion, in which pilot plants can be overly costly for early-stage investors, but overly risky for traditional project finance. The tax equity relief these credits provide plays an essential role in bridging this gap to allow fusion energy companies to reach commercial viability. Furthermore, the transferability provision of these tax credits enables pre-revenue fusion energy startups to also benefit from these credits.

However, the version of the 2025 reconciliation bill which recently passed the House would eliminate 48E and 45Y for all projects except those for which construction begins within 60 days of the enactment of the proposed legislation, and for such projects to be placed into service (i.e., reaching the grid) by the end of 2028. In practice, this makes all fusion energy projects ineligible for this credit, pulling the rug out from under the fusion energy companies driving U.S. leadership in the sector.

Preserving the existing 48E and 45Y phaseout schedule, and ideally extending these tax credits through 2040, would give U.S. fusion energy companies the runway to fulfill their potential to secure U.S. energy independence, enable energy addition to meet growing power needs, stabilize future grids, and drive economic growth. Furthermore, amending the advanced manufacturing production credit (45X) to include key components of fusion systems would encourage the growth of a world-leading fusion energy supply chain in the United States, creating manufacturing jobs and driving economic growth.

Federal investment should be focused on closing the science and technology gaps to speed up commercialization, like increasing support for experimental facilities and sustaining funding for existing ones. By directing public sector resources toward closing science and technology gaps required across concepts, industry-wide commercialization challenges can be addressed without the government “picking winners.” This requires coordination between the public and private sector. The Fusion Industry Association’s one-time appropriations request includes $4.3 billion to support the construction of necessary test beds to close these gaps, and to expand public-private partnerships aimed at addressing the key science and technology challenges facing fusion commercialization. This would help direct public sector resources towards commercially relevant R&D.

Congress should increase resources for the Milestone-Based Fusion Development Program (MBFDP) to match the scale required for demonstration and pilot plants. Fusion energy companies face a chicken-or-the-egg challenge: even with a strong concept, prototype development can stall due to a lack of funding, with many investors requiring proof-of-concept before committing large blocks of capital, but proving a concept requires significant funding upfront. By providing milestone-based support and crowding in private investment, the MBFDP helps private companies secure the resources necessary to build their demonstration and subsequently pilot plants. The Fusion Industry Association’s one-time appropriations request to allot $4.95 billion over the next ten years to support MBFDP would provide necessary scale to support American private fusion companies compete against state-sponsored global competitors in putting fusion energy watts on the grid.",https://cdn.catf.us/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/06115415/data-abstract-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-06-02 12:29:53.070563

*** Hunton’s Nuclear and Agency Finance Teams Hunton has extensive experience in the development and financing of nuclear power plants in the US and across the globe and is advising clients on market-leading SMR and Advanced Reactor nuclear projects.","The four (4) nuclear energy Executive Orders issued on Friday, May 23, 2025 (Nuclear EOs), set out a 25-year whole-of-government plan for further development and successful deployment of US nuclear technology—both domestically and internationally, and addressing the full scope of the nuclear industry (licensing, fuel life cycle, reactor technology, supply chain, workforce, spent fuel and waste disposal, financing and international agreements)—ultimately culminating in 400 GW of US nuclear energy capacity by 2050.

The volume of required actions illustrates the Trump Administration’s drive to launch a US nuclear renaissance. Within the first 90 days, the Nuclear EOs address establishing domestic fuel supply, regulatory overhauls, fast-tracking reactor deployments utilizing Department of Defense (DOD) and Department of Energy (DOE) jurisdiction, authorizing financial support via US Export-Import Bank (US Ex-Im), agency finance institutions and multilateral banks, and employing diplomatic tools to promote the US nuclear industry. This article highlights key required activities on a year-by-year basis, along with supporting activities to be undertaken in parallel, followed by a comprehensive timeline of all activities and achievements required by the Nuclear EOs.

Required Activities for 2025

The Nuclear EOs mandate the following key activities and achievements for the remainder of 2025:

designating one or more sites owned or controlled by DOE in the United States for deployment of advanced nuclear reactor technology;

utilizing the Defense Production Act and developing a plan to accelerate the development of low enriched uranium (LEU) and high assay low enriched uranium (HALEU) capabilities and to address management of spent fuel;

reforming DOE’s National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) compliance regime, including determining DOE functions that should not be subject to NEPA;

expediting intergovernmental agreements on nuclear energy and the fuel supply chain with potential export countries;

promoting adherence to the Convention on Supplemental Compensation for Nuclear Damage (CSC);

directing all executive departments and agencies that provide educational grants to prioritize investment in nuclear engineering and other nuclear energy-related careers; and

leveraging agency finance capabilities toward providing financing for deployment of American nuclear technology.

Required Activities for 2026

creating a comprehensive report relating to safe management of spent fuel, including storage, transport, recycling and reprocessing capabilities, and permanent storage;

wholesale review and revision by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) of its regulations and guidance, and issuance of final rules in respect of the same, including a maximum 18-month final decision deadline for applications to construct and operate new reactors and a maximum 12-month final decision deadline for applications to extend operating licenses for existing reactors; and

submitting recommendations for legislative proposals and regulatory actions regarding placement of advanced nuclear reactors on military installations.

Required Activities from 2027 through 2050

The Nuclear EOs mandate the following key activities and achievements within the years 2027 through 2050:

November 2027: Beginning operation of an advanced nuclear reactor at a DOE-owned or controlled site for the purpose of powering AI infrastructure, other critical or national security needs or on-site infrastructure;

September 2028: Beginning operation of a nuclear reactor at a domestic military base or installation;

January 2029: Completing negotiations of at least 20 new 123 Agreements;

within calendar year 2030: Facilitating 5 GW of uprates to existing reactors and commencement of construction of at least 10 new, large reactors with complete designs;

May 2035: Completing re-negotiation of all 123 Agreements originally set to expire by May 2035; and

within calendar year 2050: Achieving 400 GW of US nuclear energy capacity in operation.

Additional Parallel Activities

In addition to the activities noted above, the Nuclear EOs also require other substantive activities to be undertaken by the NRC, DOE, DOD and Department of State (DOS) on an ongoing basis. We have included another chart below, following the detailed, comprehensive timeline, that lists these parallel activities. These activities range from right-sizing headcounts to continuing regulatory overhauls (particularly within the NRC, as well as environmental regulatory regimes), developing a HALEU fuel bank, expediting decisions on technology transfer export authorization requests, prioritizing issuance of security clearances and supporting diplomatic efforts via 123 Agreements.

Conclusion

The scope and volume of required activities and multi-agency effort under these Nuclear EOs underscore the priority the administration is placing on the accelerated development and deployment of US nuclear technology. As mentioned, we have set out below a comprehensive timeline and list of all activities required by the Nuclear EOs, on a year-by-year and agency-by-agency basis. Hunton plans to issue a series of articles providing more in-depth review and discussion of impacts to the US nuclear industry. We will also continue to monitor any further nuclear energy-related Executive Orders and impacts from pending and newly passed legislation, including impacts to currently available tax credits for the nuclear industry under proposed amendments to the Inflation Reduction Act.

Gas-fired power plants are the most common fast-response option of choice today, increasingly allied to lithium-ion batteries to manage short-duration balancing challenges.
On an international stage, the first mover on this opportunity today is the UK company Highview Power.
“Though smaller than what will follow, this one is very important because it is our first full-scale commercial plant,” says Highview Power CEO Richard Butler.","The UK’s policy frameworks have helped to unlock an opportunity in cryogenic gas that will lead to the gradual phase-out of gas-fired power plants in the UK in the decades ahead – and other countries could follow suit.

This is the headline message from Richard Butland CEO of green-energy innovator Highview Power, in a recent interview with gasworld.

“Policy is critical,” said Butland. “The right [policy] frameworks unlock everything as [they] give us access to the cheapest capital on the best terms [by] providing certainty [to projects].”

Butland also made the follow-up point that providing certainty is not the same as providing a subsidy.

“There have been some research and development grants we have secured down the years, but we don’t expect government handouts. These are 50-year investments we are making – and the right policy framework means we can secure capital at 6%, say, rather than 12% or more. That is critical.”

Highview’s business model is to fund and own the assets it builds, in the knowledge that the power its technology supplies has long-term payment guarantees that attach which make the whole opportunity stack up financially. This is what the UK’s policy set-up has delivered, enabling Highview to move ahead with confidence.

The background to Highview Power’sinvestment

As the energy transition builds, and renewable energy grows in the mix, the question of how to store electricity most effectively for grid flexibility has been climbing the agenda.

Gas-fired power plants are the most common fast-response option of choice today, increasingly allied to lithium-ion batteries to manage short-duration balancing challenges.

But it is well understood that another piece in the puzzle is needed in the form of low-carbon long-duration energy storage. This means large stores of low- or zero-carbon energy that can be accessed and used from four to up to 20 hours at a time, and sometimes even longer.

One of the leading moves in this space is a cryogenic technology that delivers precisely such long-duration storage – the use of liquid air to deliver stored energy.

On an international stage, the first mover on this opportunity today is the UK company Highview Power. And more than a decade on from proving its technology with a small-scale pilot project near London, a first commercial-scale plant is now taking shape, to be followed by four much larger plants by 2030, with two to be built in Scotland and two in England.

Each of the four larger planned UK facilities is a 2.5GWh plant and due to come onstream by 2030, but before that Highview will deliver a smaller project at Carrington near Manchester, in north-west England.

“Though smaller than what will follow, this one is very important because it is our first full-scale commercial plant,” says Highview Power CEO Richard Butler.

The plant encompasses compression, liquefaction, and storage of air, ready for regasification and being put through a steam turbine to make electricity.

The Carrington plant should be ready to switch on in the first quarter of 2026 and will serve as an important test-case for Highview.","https://www.gasworld.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=900,fit=contain,quality=75,metadata=none,format=auto,gravity=auto/https://www.gasworld.com/wp-content/files/2025/05/Richard-Butland-CEO.jpg",N,,2025-06-02 12:30:00.957214

However, in that timespan, a lot has changed in the automotive industry, as EV adoption has slowed greatly compared to its earlier, rapid pace, prompting many companies – including Ford – to scale back their planned investments in that particular area, as well as plans to expand EV lineups in many ways. Regardless, it sees as if Ford’s EV team isn’t going anywhere.

“And so that strategy all remains the same. We’re going to stay in EVs. We’re going to continue to invest in our advanced electrical development team out in California,” Ford Vice Chair John Lawler stated at the 2025 AllianceBernstein Strategic Decisions Conference. “There’s a lot of benefits that are coming from that. That’s not changing, but we’ve adjusted, based on the customer feedback we had being in the marketplace early, to what types of vehicles are actually going to resonate with customers and how do we make them more affordable so that we can attract a larger cohort of customers because large vehicles are not the right form factor for EVs.”

Indeed, Ford has pivoted away from focusing on developing larger, more expensive EVs in favor of smaller, more affordable ones, and that’s precisely what its skunkworks team has been tasked with creating for years now. Ford CEO Jim Farley recently revealed that this new, future platform is officially called CE1 Skunk Works, which is the first time we’ve heard that piece of information.

Ford has been in the midst of developing platforms for future EVs for some time now, but last month, we learned that the company’s low-cost EVs will have their own unique setup – officially known as CE1. Ford’s skunkworks EV team is using a streamlined process to develop that particular platform, which is set to underpin a handful of future models, potentially starting with a mid-size pickup. Those models will be a bit more simplistic in nature, with Farley recently confirming that they won’t be sold with things like Level 3 autonomous driving technology, however.

Additionally, the weight of the future of zero-emission vehicles and clean air requirements will fall on states and OEMs.
“California profoundly disagrees with today’s unconstitutional, illegal and foolish vote attempting to undermine critical clean air protections,” she wrote.
Turning the clock back on both cleaner combustion engine requirements and zero-emission technology is an attack on clean air.” Meanwhile, states that voted to adopt CARB’s regulations are postponing enforcement.
The organization added that it would erase much of the $400 billion in investment and savings that clean energy tax credits have generated thus far.","The approval of Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolutions that overturn U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s waivers of key California Air Resources Board (CARB) regulations, aimed at enforcing stricter emissions and goals for selling zero-emission vehicles, have states and truck manufacturers rethinking their strategies.

The CRA upends plans to implement Advanced Clean Trucks (ACT), which would require manufacturers to sell an increasing percentage of zero-emission chassis, including those for school buses by 2035. The CRA also targets Advanced Clean Cars II that would require all passenger car, truck and SUV sales be zero-emission in 2035 and the Omnibus Heavy-Duty Low NOx regulations for off-road emissions.

While the waivers were not been signed by President Donald Trump at this writing, California is at least one state preparing to take legal action if and when signed. Additionally, the weight of the future of zero-emission vehicles and clean air requirements will fall on states and OEMs. Many OEMs are taking a wait and see approach.

“Today’s votes in the Senate fly in the face of nearly 50 years of precedent. For decades, California and other states have had the authority to adopt vehicle emissions standards that exceed those at the federal level, and for good reason,” said Dan Lashof, senior fellow at World Resources Institute (WRI), when the CRA passed the Senate May 22. “These standards are vital in protecting people from the vehicle pollution which causes asthma attacks and other serious health problems.”

CARB Chair Liane Randolph released a statement disapproving of the CRA waivers, noting that it is a “short-sighted political move” and a strike against the long-term goal of zero-emission vehicles.

“California profoundly disagrees with today’s unconstitutional, illegal and foolish vote attempting to undermine critical clean air protections,” she wrote. “It’s an assault on states’ rights the federal administration claims to support that puts national air quality standards out of reach and will have devastating effects for the 150 million Americans who breathe unhealthy air every day. These actions are contrary to the text of the Congressional Review Act, as recognized by the nonpartisan U.S. Government Accountability Office and the Senate Parliamentarian. California will pursue every available remedy to challenge these actions and defend our right to protect the public from dangerous air pollution. Turning the clock back on both cleaner combustion engine requirements and zero-emission technology is an attack on clean air.”

Meanwhile, states that voted to adopt CARB’s regulations are postponing enforcement. Four of the 10 states that follow CARB (Maryland, Massachusetts, Oregon and Vermont) have pushed back their ACT compliance timelines by a year or more.

While not a CARB-specific state, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection announced earlier this month it is extending its suspension of enforcement of its own Pennsylvania Heavy-Duty Diesel Emissions Control Program until Jan. 2, 2028.

This includes school buses and the ACT rule. Gerry Wosewick, executive director of the Pennsylvania School Bus Association, said the government agency has been working hard with partner organizations to roll back this requirement.

“This has been a legislative priority for us for quite a few years now and we have been advocating for it pretty heavily during that time,” Wosewick said. “It was actually a part of [the PSBS] legislative committee’s [strategy] plan. Since this is a regulatory issue, we have had several pieces of legislation that have been entered over multiple sessions in an effort to best address this change. Despite our lobbying efforts, we have been unsuccessful in getting any legislation through.”

With the Pennsylvania School Boards Association, MTA and others, Wosewick said there was enough pressure to address the regulation, which was key to getting it delayed.

“I oftentimes refer to it as the death by a thousand paper cuts in Pennsylvania,” he added. “While our contractors are phenomenal and find new and innovative ways to continue operations, it’s the constant small regulatory and statutory changes that keep making it more difficult to operate in the industry.”

Instead, he commented the industry should be able to work collaboratively to focus on timely emissions rollouts, as opposed to being forced to respond to regulatory drives.

Back at the federal level, the budget reconciliation bill passed by the House of Representatives May 22 is a comprehensive piece of legislation proposing significant changes, including scaling back the tax credits for clean energy included in the Inflation Reduction Act.

WRI noted that if the cuts in the current iteration of the bill are passed, “average Americans will see severe consequences: Businesses will face more red tape and uncertainty; it will be more difficult and costly to meet growing electricity demand; consumers will see skyrocketing electricity prices; workers will lose jobs; and local governments will encounter barriers to implementing programs that benefit their communities and save money,” it said in a statement.

The organization added that it would erase much of the $400 billion in investment and savings that clean energy tax credits have generated thus far.

“The proposed sudden elimination of the credits, which support low and no emission vehicle technologies, including the Qualified Commercial Clean Vehicle Credit (45W) and the Alternative Fuel Vehicle Refueling Property Credit (30C), will not only hinder the transition to cleaner vehicles and healthier communities but will pose immediate logistical and financial challenges to school districts, municipalities and others who have already made plans and budget decisions predicated on being able to access these credits,” WRI said. “Moreover, eliminating these credits means we are limiting consumer choice and ceding competitiveness in this growing market to China.”",https://stnonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/22-stnexpo-ridedrive.jpg,N,,2025-06-02 12:30:50.153844

In determining that PJM faces an emergency, DOE also cited a PJM report from February 2023 indicating the grid operator faced tightening supply-demand conditions this decade.
PJM approved Constellation’s request to shutter its Eddystone units 3 and 4 in February 2024, saying retiring the units didn’t pose reliability risks.
“Trump’s last minute emergency order — issued literally on the last day these power plants were set to operate — causes significant, expensive complications,” Slocum said.
Besides issuing additional emergency orders, DOE can extend previously issued orders under FPA section 202, ClearView Energy Partners said in a client note on May 30.","Dive Brief:

Declaring an emergency in parts of the PJM Interconnection’s footprint, the U.S. Department of Energy on Friday ordered Constellation Energy and PJM to continue operating 760 MW of oil- and gas-fired peaking capacity in Pennsylvania that Constellation had planned to deactivate the next day.

The emergency order directs Constellation to keep operating two units at its Eddystone power plant near Philadelphia until Aug. 28. The order can be extended.

PJM supports DOE’s order. “The department’s order is a prudent, term-limited step that will retain the covered generators for a 90-day period,” the grid operator said Saturday. “This will allow DOE, Constellation Energy and PJM to undertake further analysis regarding the longer-term need and viability of these generators.”

Dive Insight:

The Federal Power Act’s section 202(c) gives the DOE secretary the authority to temporarily order power plants to operate during wars and emergencies. It has been used 17 times since August 2020, according to DOE.

DOE partly based its order on a May 9 report from PJM that said the grid operator had enough power supplies for this summer under normal conditions, but that under extreme conditions featuring record-setting demand it could have to call on demand response resources to avoid power outages.

In determining that PJM faces an emergency, DOE also cited a PJM report from February 2023 indicating the grid operator faced tightening supply-demand conditions this decade. In addition, PJM in December asked FERC to approve a fast-track interconnection process for some planned power supplies to address potential reliability concerns, DOE said. FERC approved the plan in February.

“The potential shortage of electric energy, shortage of facilities for the generation of electric energy, and other causes in the region support the need for the Eddystone Units to contribute to system reliability,” DOE said.

DOE issued a similar emergency order on May 23 to keep a 1,560-MW, coal-fired power plant owned by Consumers Energy in Michigan running for nearly three months beyond its planned retirement date.

Constellation is taking immediate steps to continue to operate Eddystone units 3 and 4 through the summer, according to Paul Adams, a spokesman for the Baltimore-based independent power producer.

“Eddystone Units 3 and 4 remain in ‘Ready’ status and we are working quickly to retain necessary staff and perform necessary maintenance to allow for safe and reliable operations this summer and beyond,” Adams said Monday in an email.

Like in other regions, power plant owners in PJM must get permission from the grid operator to retire a generating unit. PJM studies whether a power plant shutdown will hurt grid reliability. PJM approved Constellation’s request to shutter its Eddystone units 3 and 4 in February 2024, saying retiring the units didn’t pose reliability risks. The units were installed between 1967 and 1970, according to Constellation.

PJM on Friday gave Buchanan Generation permission to deactivate on July 1 two gas-fired generating units in Virginia totaling 80 MW.

PJM operates the grid and wholesale power markets in 13 Mid-Atlantic and Midwest states and in the District of Columbia.

Depending on how long DOE ultimately orders the Eddystone power plant to keep running, the department’s order could affect Constellation’s plan to buy Calpine in a $16.4 billion deal. As part of its proposal pending at FERC, Constellation said it would sell four power plants totaling 3,546 MW in PJM’s eastern region, where Eddystone is located. The sale aims to allay concerns that a combined Constellation and Calpine could exert market power in eastern PJM.

Ratepayers will be required to pay for the costs of continuing to run the Eddystone units, including enough money to ensure Constellation earns a profit to maintain and run the units, Tyson Slocum, director of Public Citizen’s Energy Program, said in a press release.

“Trump’s last minute emergency order — issued literally on the last day these power plants were set to operate — causes significant, expensive complications,” Slocum said. “Old units like Eddystone require both minor and major maintenance — maintenance that was deferred because of its planned retirement on May 31.”

DOE’s “move to keep these zombie plants online will have significant public health impacts and increase electricity costs for people in Michigan and Pennsylvania,” Kit Kennedy, power sector managing director at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said Saturday.

Besides issuing additional emergency orders, DOE can extend previously issued orders under FPA section 202, ClearView Energy Partners said in a client note on May 30. “Weather predictions lie outside our remit, but we would suggest that a long, hot summer could set the stage for an extension,” the research firm said about the Consumers Energy order.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/qzgXMv1J3VMrM8hc0NRGP3uEIbTMr5RaEZOYFtpLgTE/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9QSk1fQ29udHJvbF9Sb29tXzEuSlBH.webp,N,,2025-06-02 12:30:04.446619

Any new infrastructure project or new policy change — even New York City’s congestion charge — requires some form of NEPA study.","A new chapter opened for one of the country’s most important environmental laws this week.

On Thursday, the Supreme Court transformed the National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA, an environmental permitting law that affects virtually every decision that the federal government makes. The quasi-unanimous ruling limits the law’s scope and cuts off future avenues for challenging energy and infrastructure projects under the law.

It could reshape the scale of legal challenges that projects could face in the future, giving the Trump administration — and any successive administration — greater leeway to approve energy projects.

Under NEPA, federal agencies must study the environmental impacts of their decisions before they make them. The strictest studies can run into the hundreds of pages, and they can take years to complete.

But in what was essentially an 8-0 decision, the Court ruled that federal agencies almost never need to analyze the second-order environmental effects of their decisions. In other words, an agency need only study the environmental impact of a project itself — be it a pipeline, a solar farm, or, in the case at issue, a railroad — and not its metaphorically downstream consequences. That remains the case even if a given project might indirectly make it much easier to do something with a big environmental footprint, such as drilling for oil or natural gas.

That is the clearest effect of the ruling. But Justice Brett Kavanaugh, writing for the court’s conservative majority, went much further than that summary alone suggests. In a broad and forceful ruling, he told lower courts that they should stop nitpicking the environmental studies that federal agencies must publish under NEPA to justify their own decision-making. Courts should, instead, defer to federal agencies as much as is reasonable when reviewing a NEPA study. “The goal of the law,” he writes, “is to inform agency decision-making, not to paralyze it.” (Justice Neil Gorsuch recused himself from the case because of his connection to an oil magnate who could have benefited from the ruling.)

That suggests a significant change is coming to how the court system interprets NEPA, a law that is little known to the general public but that plays a defining role in how federal agencies make decisions or approve infrastructure projects. NEPA creates a procedural requirement that federal agencies study the environmental impact of any “major decision,” but that category is so broad that it affects virtually everything the federal government does — spend money, write a new regulation, or approve a new project on federal land. The law and the yearslong lawsuits that it spawns have been blamed for delays in building solar farms and transmission lines, but also oil refineries and gas pipelines.

Kavanaugh’s ruling is “pretty striking for just how strident it is, and how assertively it tries to shut the door on further NEPA litigation,” Nicholas Bagley, a University of Michigan law professor who studies the permitting system, told me. Kavanaugh’s message to lower courts is, in essence, “We keep telling you to knock it off. You keep not listening. So knock it the fuck off,” Bagley said.

At the very least, the ruling suggests that a new phase in the effort to reform the country’s permitting laws has arrived. Now that movement has, in essence, been blessed by the Supreme Court.

The case in question — Seven County Infrastructure Coalition v. Eagle County, Colorado — concerns an 88-mile railroad proposed to connect the Uinta Basin in eastern Utah to the national freight rail network. In 2021, the Surface Transportation Board, a federal agency that regulates railroads, approved the project after completing a roughly 3,600-page study of the railroad’s potential environmental impact.

Almost immediately, environmental groups argued that the board’s study did not go far enough. The ground beneath the Uinta Basin is rich in a waxy and particularly carbon-intensive crude oil; right now, very little of that oil is extracted because the only way to get it out is by truck, along windy mountain roads. The railroad, if built, would allow for much larger volumes of crude to be transported out of the basin and sent to Gulf Coast refineries. Building the railroad, in other words, would indirectly increase local oil extraction, and thereby raise global greenhouse gas emissions.

The board argued that its NEPA study did not need to consider these downstream effects because the board itself does not regulate oil extraction — that is, it regulates the building of railroads, not what gets moved on them.

The eight justices agreed that the board was right: It didn’t have to consider the effects of second-order oil drilling when it approved the railroad. (The railroad remains on hold for other reasons, Sambhav Sankar, a senior vice president at Earthjustice, told me.) But by going further in his ruling, Kavanaugh entered into a running debate about the role of NEPA and other permitting laws in the American economy.

NEPA was never meant to play the commanding role that it does today, Kavanaugh writes. When it was first signed into law in 1970, NEPA was meant to act as a “purely procedural” check on federal decision-making. Agencies were supposed to conduct environmental studies, make their decisions, then move on. But in a famous 1971 ruling concerning a proposed nuclear power plant in Maryland, Judge Skelly Wright of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals transformed the law. He found that agencies had to carry out NEPA’s procedural requirements “to the fullest extent possible,” and crucially that courts could reject agencies’ analysis for lack of completeness.

Over the years, as hundreds of cases following Wright’s have added up, NEPA has turned into a “fearsome project killer,” Bagley said. Agencies spend decades of person-power and hundreds of thousands of dollars to prepare fastidious environmental reviews of their decisions. Any new infrastructure project or new policy change — even New York City’s congestion charge — requires some form of NEPA study.

Many conservatives have long opposed the modern NEPA process. But in recent years, some liberals have joined them, arguing that the law primarily slows down clean energy infrastructure and encourages NIMBYism. In practice, they say, NEPA acts as more of hindrance to the clean economy than the old fossil fuel economy: Because of a 2005 law, most oil and gas drilling has been exempt from the NEPA process, while wind farms, solar plants, and other forms of zero-carbon energy infrastructure still have to face it. Environmental groups rebut that the law is a useful tool to slow down fossil fuel pipelines, which do not generally get a NEPA exemption.

Data supports the idea that NEPA holds back clean energy projects, but that is partly because it holds back so many kinds of projects. The R Street Institute, a center-right think tank, has found that 42% of projects stalled by NEPA involved green infrastructure or conservation. Another analysis from the Center for Growth and Opportunity at Utah State University found that it takes more than two years on average for federal agencies to complete environmental reviews of solar and wind projects. Reviews for new hydroelectric or nuclear power plants take even longer.

Kavanaugh, in essence, rejects all of this. NEPA was never supposed to block or hinder large-scale energy or infrastructure projects, he writes; it was meant to “inform agency decision-making, not to paralyze it.”

“A 1970 legislative acorn has grown over the years into a judicial oak that has hindered infrastructure development ‘under the guise’ of just a little more process,” he says. When federal agencies write environmental studies under NEPA, courts should broadly defer to the decisions that they make. And even if an agency gets something wrong in its study or omits something important, that does not mean the entire study — and the decision that it justifies — should be thrown out. (There’s some irony to Kavanaugh’s call for deference to agencies here, given that the Supreme Court rejected the idea that agency regulations deserve deference last year.)

“What’s notable for me is that they didn’t just rule on the case,” Sankar, the Earthjustice lawyer told me. (Earthjustice participated in the case.) “They decided to take a broad swipe at NEPA itself, really unnecessarily.”

Alexander Mechanick, a senior policy analyst at the Niskanen Center and former White House regulatory lawyer, agreed with Sankar about the scope of the ruling. The court’s decision “does communicate over and over again, with a heavy hand, a real desire to get lower courts out of the business of fly specking the environmental impact assessments,” he told me.

It’s this forthrightness that seems to announce a new era of NEPA jurisprudence — one where the courts will accept a level of environmental review that they may have once rejected. In a way, Kavanaugh’s ruling is a fitting sequel to Wright’s 1971 decision in that both set the tone and capture the overarching environmental concerns of their respective eras, Bagley said.

Half a century ago, Judge Wright wanted to make sure that the American public could slow the wave of infrastructure that threatened to overwhelm the country’s landscape. NEPA represented “the commitment of the government to control, at long last, the destructive engine of material ‘progress,’” he wrote, asserting that judges must make sure the law’s goals are not “lost or misdirected in the vast hallways of the federal bureaucracy.”

Now, Kavanaugh seems to fear that progress itself has been held up. He writes that the modern NEPA process, with its cycles of “speculation and consultation and estimation and litigation,” has slowed down infrastructure projects and driven up their cost. He can sound more like an op-ed writer than a legal scholar as he lays out the law’s consequences in the ruling:

Fewer projects make it to the finish line. Indeed, fewer projects make it to the starting line. Those that survive often end up costing much more than is anticipated or necessary, both for the agency preparing the EIS and for the builder of the project. And that in turn means fewer and more expensive railroads, airports, wind turbines, transmission lines, dams, housing developments, highways, bridges, subways, stadiums, arenas, data centers, and the like. And that also means fewer jobs, as new projects become difficult to finance and build in a timely fashion.

In this declaration, Kavanaugh seems to put himself on the side of a growing and tenuously bipartisan movement to reform NEPA. A 2023 debt ceiling bill, signed by President Biden, included modest reforms to the NEPA process, imposing page limits and deadlines on the strictest forms of environmental studies. A more sweeping bipartisan effort to change the law failed last year. Now, House Republicans are taking their own crack at revising NEPA, creating an optional and more expensive permitting “fast track” for developers in the reconciliation bill.

Sankar, whose organization has championed NEPA, argues that the ruling’s practical upshot will be to allow the Trump administration greater leeway to build fossil fuel infrastructure. Kavanaugh’s ruling exhibits “a shocking disregard for the realpolitik of what's going on with this administration in particular,” he said.

“As we’ve been saying all along, NEPA gets demonized as the problem,” Sankar said. With the law’s role reduced, “I think people will see that there are a lot of other things that are the problem here, and taking federal agency expertise out of the equation is not going to hurry things up.” He added that state and local governments often rely on federal NEPA reports for their own analyses, and now those reviews may be less trustworthy.

Bagley, who has generally supported permitting reform efforts, agreed that NEPA is just one of several laws holding back clean energy projects nationwide. But it is an important one, he said, and reducing its scope will likely allow more projects to happen. He added that by changing it, advocates will learn of additional bottlenecks that are holding back construction — including laws that nobody has noticed yet because they were previously less important than NEPA. Advocates can also now focus their attention on state and local barriers to building.

“If you want to look at the permitting burdens across the United States, probably 80% to 90% of them are state and local. This [ruling] isn’t going to inaugurate a new era of American dynamism,” Bagley said. “It’s a small step in the right direction.”",https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MDM0MTQ4Mi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTgxMDIwOTM1MX0.W-MFFQTZQg680fQGjR2Oa_XkUCA_-hIIBlZ19SpAdyg/image.jpg?width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C100%2C0%2C100,N,,2025-06-02 12:30:07.600891

""Socially just and climate-friendly electric mobility is feasible. Politicians must finally help to make small, climate-friendly cars in particular more affordable,” the NGOs said.

The report compiled by think tank Green Budget Germany (FÖS) says that the government should finance price reductions for electric cars, as well as low-income leasing options, by increasing levies on combustion engine cars and reforming company car taxation.

The ramp-up of electromobility is key for finally reducing emissions in the transport sector, which have been flatlining for decades in Germany. A successful shift to electric mobility will also be crucial to secure the long-term survival of the country’s automotive industry. The new government plans to promote electric vehicles with new purchase incentives, but has yet to provide a detailed proposal. The choice for the new transport minister, Patrick Schnieder from the conservative Christian Democrat Union (CDU), suggests that profound policy shifts in the sector are unlikely.

Germany was aiming to have 15 million electric cars on the road by 2030, but sales collapsed after the previous government axed a popular subsidy programme after Germany's 2023 debt brake ruling, putting this target increasingly out of reach. Following a 27 percent-reduction in sales of new battery electric cars (BEV) in Germany in 2024, a total of 1.65 million BEVs were registered at the start of this year.

Policies that make combustion engine cars more expensive are particularly effective for climate protection, says the report, which was commissioned by environmental NGOS Friends of the Earth Germany (BUND) and NABU, umbrella group Climate-Alliance Germany, the country’s largest social welfare organisation Caritas, as well as the ACE Auto Club Europa.

The report urges the government to not repeat the previous support policy consisting of across-the-board purchase subsidies, given that circumstances have changed since then. “In the mid and high price categories, electric cars are already often cheaper than comparable combustion models,” the report states, adding that support for those models would therefore be a waste of money because people would buy them regardless of subsidies. Instead, purchase support should be focused on smaller cars and low-income households.

The NGOs called for a registration tax which would make small and efficient electric cars cheaper, while buyers of particularly climate-damaging luxury cars would have to pay up to 17,500 euros extra. They also favoured a social leasing model that would result in monthly payments of 70 and 150 euros, depending on the car model.",https://www.cleanenergywire.org/sites/all/themes/cleanenergywire/logo_og.png,N,,2025-06-02 12:29:30.829830

They have stood for nearly 5000 years enduring extreme weather conditions such as drought, rainfall, and high temperatures. The magic behind the pyramid’s longevity comes from its triangular shape that evenly distributes the weight and impact of these external forces, preventing erosion and deformation.

However, if one side wall were to break, the two remaining sides would lose their stability and the structure would quickly collapse. Just as any other pyramid structure, its strength comes from its sides that provide the internal stability. In the same way, we as humans have needs for our own well-being.

On the base of Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs lies a person’s first and most essential physiological needs: breathing, food, water, shelter, clothing, sleep. With these being the bedrock of survival, they are directly connected to the global food, water, and energy systems. Food, water, and energy are all intertwined, and one cannot be sustained without the other. Take, for example, how water provides the hydration and food we need to survive and energy powers the infrastructure and processes that bring us clean water and produce food. If any one of these aspects is missing, it affects the others and undermines our basic needs.

The food-water-energy nexus forms the foundation of human existence, much like the sides of a pyramid that depend on each other for structural integrity. When we have a stable flow of food, water, and energy, we can thrive, allowing us to move upwards through the hierarchy of needs, toward the higher levels of safety, love, esteem, and ultimately self-actualization. However, if one of these more base needs is compromised, it creates instability, preventing us from meeting the higher needs in Maslow’s pyramid.

Food Holds Everything Together

While the majority of the Earth’s surface is covered by water, less than 1% of that water is fresh and salt free. To make this water drinkable, it must go to a water treatment plant that utilizes energy-intensive processes like filtration, disinfection, and distribution.

On the flip side, water is used during every phase of energy production from extracting resources to cooling power plants. These systems are directly connected: Energy is required to produce water and water is used to produce energy.

Within the lakes of New Jersey lies the largest floating photovoltaic plant that mutually benefits both water and energy systems. This system places rows of solar panels directly on the surface of the Canoe Brook Reservoir which powers the nearby Canoe Brook Water Treatment Plant. Rather than outsourcing its energy needs to solar panels on land, this technology provides clean energy while reducing water evaporation, protecting water resources, and minimizing land use. Alongside that, the natural cooling effect of water prevents the solar panels from overheating and increases electricity gains up to 22%.

These technologies are a great start for conservation, but it does not protect the needs of food. Given that the agriculture sector consumes about 70% of global freshwater, much of their needs are met with naturally occurring reservoirs and aquifers. The floating photovoltaic plant doesn’t allow sufficient solar radiation to reach the microbial aquatic community which changes its natural water levels. This can have negative effects for downstream ecosystems of agricultural land that depend on these waters, and essentially harming food production in the long term. And without food, there’s no reason to preserve water and energy resources.

Without Water, the Pyramid Cannot Stand

As the human population continues to grow by the millions each year, feeding everyone nutritious meals is one of the most pressing issues of our time. When the price of energy increases, the price of fertilizers, electricity for machinery, and processing all go up too. As a result food availability and accessibility will be more restricted.

The Safi Region of Morocco has a solution that resists using fossil fuel for energy generation by integrating wind energy, with a wind-hydrogen conversion system, to enhance their agriculture production. Specifically, these wind turbines ensure reliable energy supply by utilizing the hydrogen power to store its energy for greenhouse operations like irrigation, heating, and cooling. This has led to substantial reductions in carbon emissions as a result, allowing this model to be adopted in other arid and semi-arid regions.

Although this system has been able to support food production through clean energy, it has had a direct impact on the environment. Due to the fact that hydrogen energy undergoes a process called electrolysis where water is split into hydrogen and oxygen elements using electricity, large amounts of water is used. This has increased water stress in the region and has left aquifers dry. The region’s lack of policies and regulation in protecting water usage has worsened this issue and deteriorated its water quality, directly impacting the health of its people and the environment. While food and energy can mutually benefit each other, it cannot be sustained without proper water planning as all resources depend on water availability.

While energy is conserved and dependable for food production, the maintenance of these energy sources have increased water stress in the region and have left aquifers dry. Without the proper method of water preservation and regulation, there are again losses in agriculture. Not to mention, the deteriorating water quality can have direct health impacts on people and the environment.

What Happens When Energy is Lost?

More often than not, water and food insecurity occur simultaneously. Water scarcity limits agricultural productivity whereas food scarcity can exacerbate clean water accessibility. Especially since producing and transporting food requires significant water resources, communities are only left with contaminated water sources for everyday use. This directly and indirectly impacts malnutrition of children and adults, further emphasizing the consequences of these systems being independent of each other.

But there are solutions. Here’s how— in Bangladesh farmers take existing fish ponds and plant their rice paddy fields within them. Typically, paddy is grown in flooded fields but due to the groundwater shortages in the country, many farms have dried up. This approach allows rice yields to increase by 8 to 15% with the nutrient cycling and pest control handled by the fish.

Despite such innovative methods, Bangladesh still faces extensive drought periods every year. When ponds and aquifers are dried out for irrigation, farmers must utilize electric pumps to draw water from deeper in the ground. These pumps are overworked during the heat and operating at a much higher rate, consuming more energy than usual. This goes to show that without using effective energy management strategies, climate change will drain energy resources faster.

The Triangular Nexus: Where Food, Water, and Energy Converge for Global Sustainability

Attempting to achieve food, water, and energy security independently is like trying to balance the three corners of a pyramid—it simply cannot be done without endangering the availability of the other resource. In our growing world, there is only a limited amount of these natural resources before we risk completely exploiting the Earth.

Understanding how these systems are tightly interwoven within the triangle of food, water, and energy allows for the development of better technologies, practices, and policies that address these systems together.

Utilizing the nexus, Sundrop Farms in Port Augusta, Australia which grows tomatoes, harnesses solar energy to power a desalination plant that provides clean water for their greenhouse. Despite Australia being prone to extreme climate, making agriculture difficult, they are able to produce 15% of the country’s tomatoes! They are fresh-water self-sufficient by converting seawater from nearby gulf which means they do not use locally contaminated groundwater. Their solar farm not only produces enough electricity to power their desalination plant but also utilizes any excess energy for heat and storage facilities as well.

Ensuring that food, water, and energy has a circular flow, these kinds of holistic systems efficiently utilize and optimize our finite resources. By being local and self-sufficient, they are also able to adapt to fit their own climate change challenges. With this adoption of the ‘Nexus Approach’ we can foster true sustainability and transcend our hierarchy of needs because our basic needs have been met: Food which nourishes us. Water that sustains us. And power — clean, renewable power — that is the invisible force that keeps everything powered up and working.

To initiate the Food-Water-Energy Nexus in your area, changes need to happen within our government. Instead of treating food, water, and energy as separate sections, they must be integrated and seen as interconnected components of a single system.

Multilateral development banks (MDBs) are in a position to enable this expansion of energy in their mission to help developing economies achieve economic growth and energy access, but the banks are hindering the use of nuclear power. Meanwhile, Russia and China, both nuclear technology export leaders, are filling the gap and gaining geopolitical influence. Other countries, such as France and the Republic of Korea, have state-owned nuclear enterprises, but they are market competitors and not geopolitical adversaries. As developing nations seek nuclear power to meet rising energy needs, MDBs must revise their outdated and politicized views of the technology—or risk ceding political capital to autocratic actors.

STAY CONNECTED

An essential tool in the development toolkit

Developing countries’ energy demand is rising, requiring more firm power generation. Nuclear energy offers a reliable baseload critical for economies industrializing with energy-intensive sectors such as manufacturing and data centers. A 900-MW nuclear reactor can produce—with a much smaller footprint—the same power as 8.5 million solar panels or 800 wind turbines. And, unlike hydropower and geothermal energy, nuclear power is much less geographically constrained, enabling it to be sited in many locations.

Major economies are exporting their nuclear aversion

Currently, most MDBs do not fund nuclear energy projects. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) refuses to finance nuclear energy projects due to issues such as waste management and high investment costs. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) prioritizes its energy strategy for “scaling up renewables,” supporting nuclear projects solely in areas of safety like decommissioning, with no involvement in construction. EBRD states it is neither in favor of or opposed to nuclear energy; it is simply operating within the mandate determined by its shareholders. The World Bank—the largest and arguably most influential MDB—cites a lack of expertise as its reason for not funding nuclear energy projects, although it frequently relies on external contractors for expertise in other sectors.

However, the World Bank’s president, Ajay Banga, recently signaled a potential shift by pushing the board to reconsider its stance on funding nuclear energy projects. In reality, the World Bank’s voting structure, which allocates voting power according to how much funding a country provides, grants its biggest funders with veto power. Germany serves as a key example: it shut down its nuclear reactors and opposed the inclusion of nuclear power in the European Union’s green investment taxonomy. The World Bank is held hostage by this tunnel vision, which supports only renewable projects, even though these technologies alone cannot meet the growing energy demands of developing nations.

MDBs’ refusal to fund nuclear power projects exacerbates the geopolitical divide between developing economies and the developed nations. This results in missed opportunities to expand energy access in poorer nations based on the prejudices of wealthier nations.

Lenders of last resort

MDBs’ current failure to finance nuclear projects cedes opportunities to other lenders. Western banks, including Goldman Sachs and Barclays, recently announced their support for nuclear energy, but this long-term commitment is questionable given private lenders’ risk-averse nature. Prolonged construction timelines and high capital costs for nuclear energy projects in countries like the United States may eventually deter commercial banks from maintaining their support for the technology.

Russia and China could fill the gap if the West leaves nuclear financing to others. Russia leads global nuclear power plant construction, accounting for about 60 percent of reactor exports, with ongoing projects in nations like Turkey, Bangladesh, and Egypt. Similarly, China is rapidly building out its domestic nuclear capacity—targeting over 100 new reactors by 2035—and leveraging the technology as a geopolitical tool under its Belt and Road Initiative, establishing projects in nations such as Pakistan and Argentina.

The MDBs’ absence in nuclear financing starkly contrasts with the generous loans offered by Russia and China. By leveraging state funding, Russia offers highly attractive terms, covering up to 85 percent of total project costs, as seen in Egypt’s loan, with lower interest rates and longer repayment periods than those required by the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) for its members—an organization that does not include Russia or China. Russia is also expanding its equity stakes in international nuclear projects, such as Turkey’s Akkuyu nuclear power plant, where it holds a majority stake, fostering closer geopolitical ties and exerting influence over critical energy infrastructure.

Similarly, China extends significant financial support, covering 85 percent of construction costs for Pakistan’s Chasma 5 reactor along with a $100 million discount on the total project cost. China has also offered to cover 85 percent of costs in loans for Argentina’s Atucha III reactor.

By refusing to finance nuclear projects, MDBs force developing nations to rely on Russian and Chinese nuclear exports. Both nations’ dominance in nuclear energy exports risks creating significant geopolitical imbalances, expanding their grip on critical energy sources while weakening Western influence over international energy security. The MDBs must rectify this problem to ensure a more geopolitically diverse financing model for nuclear power construction and operation in developing nations.

Breaking the logjam

MDBs must consider structural changes to bypass the veto power of its major players and begin funding nuclear energy projects. One option is to create a consortium of pro-nuclear states within the MDBs. These nations could create a separate fund for nuclear energy financing, independent of contributions from anti-nuclear nations. This would not be a complete fix—the bank’s broader policy against nuclear finance would remain unaffected—but it’s a crucial step in the right direction.

Outside of direct financial support, development banks do have other options. They can establish pathways for technical assistance for nuclear projects, similar to the Energy for Growth Hub’s nuclear trust fund proposal for the World Bank. This can include enlisting expert contractors as advisors to governments building nuclear power plants and fostering open dialogues on nuclear energy. By taking these steps, development banks can empower developing nations to harness nuclear power and create a more equitable energy future.

Don’t hand adversaries a nuclear victory

The increasing dominance of Moscow and Beijing in global nuclear energy finance risks reshaping future energy affairs. It is time for MDBs to acknowledge nuclear energy as an essential tool to expand energy access. The World Bank and other multilateral organizations must reform their antiquated policies to support nuclear energy deployment and allow developing countries to more readily achieve economic growth. If they don’t, autocratic regimes willing to weaponize their energy dominance will eagerly fill the void.

Included in the survey are companies that are incorporated in the U.S., operate in the U.S., and file financial statements with a government agency. This includes private companies and cooperatives that file a 10-K or a comparable financial statement with a government agency, and mutual insurance companies that file with state regulators. It also includes companies that file with a government agency but are owned by private companies, domestic or foreign, that do not file such financial statements. Excluded are private companies not filing with a government agency; companies incorporated outside the U.S.; and U.S. companies consolidated by other companies, domestic or foreign, that file with a government agency. Also excluded are companies that failed to report full financial statements for at least three-quarters of the current fiscal year. Percent change calculations for revenue, net income, and earnings per share are based on data as originally reported. They are not restated for mergers, acquisitions, or accounting changes. The only changes to the prior years’ data are for significant restatement owing to reporting errors that require a company to file an amended 10-K.

Revenues are as reported, including revenues from discontinued operations when published. If a spin-off is on the list, it has not been included in discontinued operations. Revenues for commercial banks includes interest and noninterest revenues. Revenues for insurance companies include premium and annuity income, investment income, and capital gains or losses, but exclude deposits. Revenue figures for all companies include consolidated subsidiaries and exclude excise taxes. Data shown are for the fiscal year ended on or before Jan. 31, 2025. Unless otherwise noted, all figures are for the year ended Dec. 31, 2024.

Profits are shown after taxes, extraordinary credits or charges, cumulative effects of accounting changes, and noncontrolling interests (including subsidiary preferred dividends), but before preferred dividends of the company. Figures in parentheses indicate a loss. Profit declines of more than 100% reflect swings from 2023 profits to 2024 losses. Profits for real estate investment trusts, partnerships, and cooperatives are reported but are not comparable with those of the other companies on the list because they are not taxed on a comparable basis. Profits for mutual insurance companies are based on statutory accounting.

Assets are the company’s year-end total. Total stockholders’ equity is the sum of all capital stock, paid-in capital, and retained earnings at the company’s year-end. Excluded is equity attributable to noncontrolling interests. Also excluded is redeemable preferred stock whose redemption is either mandatory or outside the company’s control. Dividends paid on such stock have been subtracted from the profit figures used in calculating return on equity.

The figure shown is a fiscal year-end number as published by the company in its annual report. Where the breakdown between full- and part-time employees is supplied, a part-time employee is counted as one-half of a full-time employee.

The figure shown for each company is the diluted earnings-per-share figure that appears on the income statement. Per-share earnings are adjusted for stock splits and stock dividends. Though earnings-per-share numbers are not marked by footnotes, if a company’s profits are footnoted it can be assumed that earnings per share is affected as well. The five-year and 10-year earnings-growth rates are the annual rates, compounded.

Total return to investors includes both price appreciation and dividend yield to an investor in the company’s stock.

Returns are adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, recapitalizations, and corporate reorganizations as they occurred; however, no effort has been made to reflect the cost of brokerage commissions or of taxes. Total-return percentages shown are the returns received by the hypothetical investor described above. The five-year and 10-year returns are the annual rates, compounded.

No attempt has been made to calculate median figures in the tables for groups of fewer than four companies. The medians for profit changes from 2023 to 2024 do not include companies that lost money in 2023 or lost money in both 2023 and 2024, because no meaningful percentage changes can be calculated in such cases.

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission has approved NuScale Power’s design for a 462-MW small modular reactor power plant, the U.S. nuclear regulator said on Thursday.

NRC completed its technical review of NuScale’s US460 in less than two years, ahead of schedule and under budget, it said. The US460 is based on NuScale’s 12-module, 600-MW US600 design, which NRC approved in 2020 after more than three and a half years of review.

The newly-approved design’s larger modules will help NuScale power plants more effectively serve hyperscale data center customers, CEO John Hopkins told investors in November. Data centers represent a key segment for the company as it looks to lock down its first U.S. customer this year.

Dive Insight:

The NRC approval came earlier than expected, according to estimated completion timelines provided by NRC and reiterated by Hopkins on several recent investor calls. NuScale had anticipated a final decision by July, Hopkins said on May 12.

The approval could be crucial as NuScale moves through “advanced commercial dialogue with major technology and industrial companies, utilities and national and local governments,” Hopkins said in March.

“Once we get finalization” for the 77-MWe design, “we’re off to the races,” Hopkins said.

NuScale has not announced a binding customer deal. But in its first-quarter investor presentation, the company said it expected a “firm customer order” by the end of this year.

NuScale manufacturing partner Doosan has 12 modules in production now at its South Korea foundry and could deliver up to 20 per year in the near term, Hopkins said on May 12. Its first power plant could be operational by the end of 2030 if it gets a finalized deal soon, he added.

For now, NuScale is acting as the nuclear technology subcontractor to Fluor Corp. on a 462-MW power plant project in Romania that could reach a final investment decision early next year.

Though it has decreased its stake over time and has said it will continue to do so, Fluor remains a major shareholder in NuScale.

NuScale previously had an agreement with Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems for a 462-MW commercial power plant at Idaho National Laboratory. Known as the Carbon Free Power Project, that plant — like the design NRC approved on Thursday — would have used six 77-MW modules. But it was canceled in November 2023 as NuScale’s target power price rose toward $90/MWh and interest from UAMPS members failed to materialize.

Thursday’s approval means the US460 meets “applicable agency safety requirements” and can be referenced in future reactor construction permit, operating license or combined license applications, NRC said.

But before building and operating a US460 plant, NuScale, its development partner ENTRA1 Energy or another entity would still have to apply for one or more of those permits or licenses. That process can take 30 months or longer at present, NRC says.

Still, NRC’s approval positions its technology as “the most near-term American SMR power solution,” NuScale said on Thursday. In addition to being the only SMR with NRC design approval, NuScale’s SMR technology is one of the few that runs on conventional low-enriched uranium rather than more scarce high-assay, low-enriched uranium.

The approval boosts NuScale amid broader momentum for U.S. advanced nuclear companies. On May 23, the Trump administration issued four executive orders to expand reactor deployments, ease regulation and shore up domestic fuel and equipment supply chains.

One order would require NRC to review new reactor applications within 18 months, significantly shorter than current timelines. Another would expand the roles of the departments of Energy and Defense in reactor licensing and deployment, potentially creating new pathways for design approvals and expedited siting of power plants on federal land.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/07QS1EBWzyfECYCerAfh9BmyXdHQoJDgjieQzzgGzoA/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS8xNjAycHgtVS5TLl9OdWNsZWFyX1JlZ3VsYXRvcnlfQ29tbWlzc2lvbi5qcGc=.webp,N,,2025-06-02 12:30:18.613658

The Shade Map, now available through American Forests’ Tree Equity Score platform, shows where shade exists — and where it doesn’t — in 101 of the largest urbanized areas in the country, covering more than 360 cities and towns. It visualizes how shade from trees and buildings changes throughout the day, providing decision-makers with data to guide local heat resilience efforts.

“Most cities aren’t armed with the data they need to know if there is shade where communities need it most,” said V. Kelly Turner, associate director of the UCLA Luskin Center for Innovation. “That’s where the Shade Map comes in. Never before has it been this easy for communities in the U.S. to know how much shade they have, where it is and whether the source is buildings or vegetation.”

The map reveals widespread “shade deserts” — areas lacking adequate shade infrastructure — throughout virtually all major urban regions in the U.S. With extreme heat contributing to an estimated 12,000 premature deaths each year, the new resource responds to an urgent public health need. It also shows that, at noon, trees provide 25 times more shade than buildings, making them a particularly powerful solution.

UCLA Luskin Center for Innovation

By showing shade at noon, 3 p.m. and 6 p.m. — including parcel-level data in select cities — the Shade Map allows civic leaders to identify where investments in natural and engineered shade are most needed.

The researchers explored the role of shade in heat equity planning in three immersive stories as examples of how the tool can be useful:

In Austin, parents can explore shade coverage on routes to schools and the disparity in shade coverage across the city.

In Detroit, transit and city planners, as well as transit riders, can explore shade conditions at and near bus stops, where coverage is critical for protecting the 85,000 people who rely on public transit daily.

In Phoenix, where dangerous heat is a daily reality, city planners and residents can use shade data to guide improvements in public parks, building on the city’s Shade Phoenix Plan.

So we are still not talking about lone owner-operators being out on the road in long-distance electric trucks for days or weeks on end.","Volvo Trucks reveals FH Aero Electric long-distance electric semi, offering a range of 372 miles.

The truck features 780 kWh worth of batteries and was engineered with MCS (megawatt charging system) in mind, which will eventually permit recharging in under an hour.

Heavy-duty electric truck offerings still face the reality of single-day trips between warehouses with their own charging infrastructure at each end, as truck charging plazas remain largely on the drawing board.

Commercial buyers now have some choices from multiple manufacturers when it comes to heavy-duty electric trucks—choices that didn't exist at all five years ago.

In a short span of time, truck makers ranging from Scania to Volvo to Daimler have introduced two- and three-axle tractors and flatbed options, allowing fleets that feature trucks that perform repeatable, daily routes to go electric.

But truck makers have more than just regional models in mind.

The latest electric semi from Volvo Trucks is aimed at long-distance routes, able to cover 600 kilometers or 372 miles between charging sessions. This would permit the truck to make the trip from Albany, NY, to Washington DC without recharging with a few miles to spare, at least on paper.

And serious distances like these require serious batteries.

The newly revealed 6x2 Volvo FH Aero Electric features 780 kWh worth of battery packs, eight in total, which coupled with a compact driveline technology dubbed e-axle maximizes the battery space on board.

And truck makers including Volvo are getting ready for a future MCS (Megawatt Charging System) that will permit the truck's batteries to complete the 20-80% session in just 40 minutes.

""Now, transport companies can operate really long distances with electric trucks without having to compromise on productivity. The superfast charging and high payload capacity make this a very competitive solution,"" said Roger Alm, President of Volvo Trucks.

Volvo Trucks’ long-distance semi seeks to give fleets a zero-emissions option as MCS tech gets ready for a wider debut, but the reality of investment in private charging infrastructure remains.

One crucial element here is the availability of MCS itself, with just a handful of stations in Europe at the moment, all of them still quite experimental even if nominally online. So a landscape where MCS stations dot European or American highways is still some time away, as are any charging stations that are designed to cater to 18-wheelers. At the moment there aren't many of those, either.

But Volvo Trucks isn't the only manufacturer racing ahead of where charging infrastructure actually is at the moment.

In 2023 Mercedes-Benz introduced its own long-distance electric semi dubbed eActros 600, with 600 kWh worth of battery capacity on board and a range of up to 310 miles.

Volvo's 372-mile truck eclipses that number, but the real-world impact of this EV range progress is perhaps secondary to other considerations currently holding back EV semi truck adoption among fleets.

But some progress is finally being made for truck charging outside of seaports.

Earlier this year Amazon ordered over 200 of the eActros trucks from Mercedes-Benz for its European operations, set to rely largely on behind-the-fence charging infrastructure at its own hubs.

In fact, it is Amazon's operations that will represent one of the largest-scale tests of long-distance electric trucks in the real world, with the sizable fleet being the largest orders for EV trucks of its kind.

Amazon is in a special if not unique position, able to operate electric semis between warehouses with their own charging infrastructure, and that's quite different from a lone driver being out on the road for several days.

In effect, it's largely the big logistics and retail companies that would even have the necessary geographic footprint to make these electric routes possible on paper, with companies like DHL in Europe being another example.

One other element that often goes unmentioned in these scenarios are repeatable routes that are easy to predict and schedule. So we are still not talking about lone owner-operators being out on the road in long-distance electric trucks for days or weeks on end.

This effectively places these semis back in the category of doing daily runs between warehouses without overnighting at trucking plazas, even if their ranges are double those of trucks meant for regional beverage delivery and other repeat routes.

But some progress is finally being made for truck charging outside of seaports. Charging corridors are finally starting to see real construction efforts in a handful of locations in Europe and North America, after years on the drawing board, with freight operators planning for an EV truck landscape that might still take a decade or more to become readily noticeable by commuters.

For now, the few long-distance electric trucks are bound to rely on their own charging infrastructure for the foreseeable future, until truck charging plazas with MCS or simply lower and less pricey charging rates become more commonplace.

Given how long it took for passenger EVs to make coast-to-coast trips in the US that weren't complete nail-biters on each leg, reaching a utopia where MCS stations permit the same for trucks could take a while.","https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/volvo-2-683da6034dbad.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.753xh;0,0.0416xh&resize=1200:*",N,,2025-06-02 12:29:18.165683

The San Diego Foundation says it has asked the EPA for more information about reimbursement for remaining expenses but has yet to hear back.
It’s common for federal grants to operate on a reimbursement basis, says Hampton Dohrman, who runs a nonprofit management and consulting firm in San Diego.
But without the expected federal funding, nonprofits may not have the financial reserves to weather these types of situations for the long term.
More than half of the San Diego County nonprofits reviewed in a report from the San Diego Regional Policy & Innovation Center had operational surpluses in 2023 — with their federal grant funding.","It came as no surprise to the team at Casa Familiar when the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency told the organization early last month that its $12.7 million federal grant was being terminated.

Casa Familiar had planned to use the money from the Community Change Grants program to improve San Ysidro’s air quality through a low-cost, zero-emissions mobility project to bring electric transportation to the community.

But the EPA had already terminated the nonprofit’s Environmental Justice Community Problem Solving grant for $500,000, awarded last year. So after months of uncertainty fueled by the Trump administration’s sweeping cuts across the federal government, the nonprofit was expecting the other shoe to drop.

And it was already feeling the financial strain. Casa Familiar had spent about half of its $500,000 grant and had budgeted to spend the remaining half this year.

The EPA grants function as reimbursements to backfill recipients’ spending: Groups must first have money to spend and then file for reimbursement with the agency.

“We were already doing the activities,” including hiring staff and distributing almost 200 air purifiers to people in the community, said Lisa Cuestas, Casa Familiar’s executive director. “That’s going to show up as a loss on our budget for this fiscal year.”

Without federal dollars coming in, Casa Familiar and other San Diego nonprofits are reevaluating their overall budgets in order to keep operating day to day. Their previously federally-funded projects are now stalled — but in addition, many groups have also been forced to cut staff, pay and services.

“We are pivoting and doing what we need to do so that our work can continue,” said Franco Garcia, the executive director of the Environmental Health Coalition, which — with its partner, the San Diego Foundation — had a $20 million EPA grant terminated.

The EPA announced in late April that it was canceling nearly 800 environmental justice grants, including those awarded under the Inflation Reduction Act’s Community Change Grants program. The legality of the terminations is still being challenged, since the funding was approved by Congress under the 2022 law.

Nearly $216 million in Community Change grants were allocated to California, and nationwide the program provided nearly $1.6 billion for environmental and climate justice projects in disadvantaged communities.

As with several departments across the federal government, the EPA has been reviewing its grant programs to ensure they “align with administration priorities,” according to an EPA spokesperson.

“Maybe the Biden-Harris Administration shouldn’t have forced their radical agenda of wasteful DEI programs and ‘environmental justice’ preferencing on the EPA’s core mission of protecting human health and the environment,” the spokesperson said in an email.

The Trump administration has moved to terminate grants from other agencies as well, including the National Endowment for the Arts, Institute of Museum and Library Services and the National Institutes of Health.

Many of the moves are being challenged in court, and some grants have been reinstated as a result of federal rulings. But in the meantime, nonprofits are figuring out what comes next.

Federal funding is crucial to the operations of many of San Diego County’s roughly 13,000 nonprofits. In 2023, roughly $940 million in federal money was awarded or contracted to about 3,600 local nonprofits alone, according to a report this month from the San Diego Regional Policy & Innovation Center.

Cuestas says Casa Familiar has had to re-forecast its budget on a near-weekly basis since January to account for the changes at the federal level.

The nonprofit spent about $20,000 of its $12.7 million grant for its zero-emissions mobility project, an amount it was able to get reimbursed despite the uncertainty. And it began hiring staff for the project, which Cuestas says would have brought about 30 new jobs to San Ysidro.

But the organization had expected to pay staff and cover programmatic costs with about $2 million of its federal funding over the next three years, and it had factored the funding into its roughly $9 million annual budget. As a result, the organization has laid off staff, including eight employees hired to work on environmental justice projects.

The Environmental Health Coalition spent about $150,000 to $200,000 on its EPA-funded climate projects, Garcia said, including one to build a linear park at Boston Avenue in Barrio Logan and another to make homes more resilient to climate disasters.

The projects are two of about a dozen that are included in “Rooted in Communidad, Cultivating Equity,” a joint initiative with the San Diego Foundation to fund climate justice efforts in neighborhoods such as Barrio Logan, Shelltown and Mount Hope.

Without funding coming from the federal government, though, the Environmental Health Coalition hasn’t been reimbursed for everything it has spent. The nonprofit has had to lay off, furlough or cut pay for about half of its staff of 15, Garcia said.

The San Diego Foundation says it has asked the EPA for more information about reimbursement for remaining expenses but has yet to hear back. A spokesperson said the foundation couldn’t give details on how much has already been spent on the projects overall as it works to prepare a final accounting of all expenses incurred.

It’s common for federal grants to operate on a reimbursement basis, says Hampton Dohrman, who runs a nonprofit management and consulting firm in San Diego. “It is reasonable for the federal government to have extra scrutiny on dollars,” he said — it can ensure that the programs “hit the boxes that were approved in the grant.”

But such grants can pose challenges for recipients, he adds. Nonprofits can only progress on projects as long as they can pay for them up front.

Federal grants also often come with indirect cost rates, which can be used to pay for administrative and other costs associated with running a program, such as paying the rent or electricity bill.

Those were some of the costs that the Museum of Us was counting on having covered by its federal funding, said James Hadden, the museum’s senior director of development and external communications.

That institution had grants from the National Endowment for the Arts and the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) terminated earlier this year. A federal judge ordered the IMLS funding reinstated — but to the organization it’s still uncertain.

Micah Parzen, the museum’s CEO, told The San Diego Union-Tribune earlier this year that the administration’s IMLS cuts in particular posed a threat to the institution’s work. “Certainly future work on existing projects is in jeopardy, and future projects,” Parzen said at the time.

More recently, museum leaders have identified different budgetary and planning scenarios going forward and remain committed to not laying off any staff, Hadden said.

The museum and other nonprofits awarded federal grants, such as the Anza-Borrego Foundation, either hadn’t yet used them or were able to get reimbursed for payments they had already made.

But without the expected federal funding, nonprofits may not have the financial reserves to weather these types of situations for the long term.

And there are already signs that some local nonprofits’ financial stability has been hit hard in recent years — especially as help from COVID-19 funds has dried up.

During the pandemic, many nonprofits benefited from emergency funding to keep providing services to their communities, which allowed them to build up their reserves, said Tessa Tinkler, the senior director of research and evaluation at University of San Diego’s Nonprofit Institute.

But according to the 2024 State of San Diego Nonprofits, a report published by the institute in January, a quarter of the organizations surveyed had less than three months of cash reserves last year. The overall average dropped from eight months of reserves in 2023 to six months the following year.

And about 40% of nonprofits surveyed used cash reserves to cover operational costs — a figure Tinkler expected to rise this year even before the Trump administration’s cuts.

“It was already going to be a year that we were probably going to see people dipping more and more into their cash reserves,” Tinkler said. “And then this happened.”

Surpluses can help ensure that a nonprofit doesn’t have to dip into its reserves in the first place. But nonprofits’ surpluses are heavily supported by federal funding — no longer so reliable.

More than half of the San Diego County nonprofits reviewed in a report from the San Diego Regional Policy & Innovation Center had operational surpluses in 2023 — with their federal grant funding. Without federal funding, that share dropped to 17%.

To Alan Berube, the report’s researcher, that’s a clear sign federal money is keeping local nonprofits afloat.

“It’s clear that taking those grants away is a huge fiscal blow to their finances,” he said, “and something that they probably can’t weather for very long without significantly cutting services, cutting payroll and maybe ultimately having to close their doors.”",https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/SUT-L-BUENFIN-1115-016.jpg?w=1024&h=679,N,,2025-06-02 12:30:54.180896

VinFast: EVs Help the Planet and the Household Budget Back to video

Article content

Canadian families are having to make tough choices as grocery bills climb by 3.8% year over year1. With 85% now feeling like they’re living paycheque to paycheque2 and 61% reconsidering major life decisions due to rising costs3, every purchase matters more than ever.

Article content

Article content

In this climate, consumers will have to calculate which vehicle makes the most financial sense over time. The answer increasingly points to electric.

Article content

The Numbers Don’t Lie

Article content

Recent research reveals a compelling financial picture for electric vehicles. Clean Energy Canada found that EVs save Canadian drivers roughly $3,000 annually on average. Over ten years, that adds up to about $30,000 in savings4. An electric hatchback or SUV can save $28,500 compared to its gasoline equivalent during the same period.

Article content

An earlier research from Vincentric supports these findings. They analyzed 40 electric vehicles against comparable gas models and came to the conclusion that 95% of EVs cost less to own over five years than their traditional counterparts5. The savings come from lower fuel costs, reduced maintenance needs, and fewer repairs.

Article content

Long seen as an environmentally friendly alternative to gasoline cars, EVs are now emerging as practical financial tools for households watching every dollar. Yes, EVs often cost more upfront, but they can reduce the total cost of ownership, a growing concern for budget-conscious families. Lower fuel costs make a difference when gas prices swing unpredictably, and reduced maintenance helps when unexpected repair bills can derail household budgets.

Article content

This financial logic could be especially appealing to parents. The Spring Financial report found that 70% of parents with kids at home are reconsidering major decisions due to cost pressures6. They’re 40% less likely to afford emergency savings compared to other Canadians.

Article content

For these families, an EV’s lower operating costs might help free up money for other priorities.

Article content

The psychological shift may be underway. Canadians who once bought EVs to feel good about the environment might now be turning to them to make better financial decisions.

Article content

Meeting the Market Where It Is

Article content

Automakers recognize this change. VinFast, the best-selling automaker in Vietnam, for example, has structured its Canadian strategy around what budget-conscious buyers actually want. Their “3 Good” approach focuses on premium cars, affordable prices, and excellent aftersales policies. It’s straightforward messaging for complicated times.

Article content

Currently, VinFast offers one of the longest warranties in the car industry, with their all-wheel-drive mid-sized electric SUV, the VinFast VF 8, covered for ten years or 200,000 kilometers, with unlimited kilometers on the battery under normal usage. This is financial insurance for families who can’t afford unexpected repair bills. The warranty reduces long-term uncertainty, which matters more when household budgets are already stretched thin.

Article content

Article content

The brand’s approach aligns with current Canadian priorities. Affordable pricing addresses upfront cost concerns. Well-equipped vehicles provide value. Strong service commitments reduce ownership risks. These aren’t luxury considerations anymore; they’re necessities for families making careful financial decisions.

Article content

VinFast’s strategy reflects the broader market reality. Canadian buyers want EVs that make financial sense first and environmental sense second. Both matter, but economic pressures have reordered priorities.

Article content

The New Equation

Article content

Today’s car buyers face a different calculation than they did several years ago. Environmental benefits still matter, but financial benefits often determine the final decision. EVs deliver on both, but the economic case has become the compelling argument.

Article content

In this environment, brands should recognize that they’re selling financial security as much as environmental responsibility. They can win over customers by understanding what Canadian families need most right now: vehicles that help their budgets work better, not just make their carbon footprint smaller.

The [environmental] groups may complain bitterly over losing a main source of leverage and fundraising appeals. But let them complain. They do not speak for the trees, much less for the American public.

But there’s a less rosy way to tell the story. The Supreme Court’s paean to agency deference is oddly selective. At the end of the last term, for example, the Court invalidated the Environmental Protection Agency’s effort to adopt a rule that would have prevented upwind states from polluting the air of downwind states. “The EPA’s sin,” as I explained for this magazine at the time, “was failing to adequately respond to a single oblique comment that it received.”

That’s the opposite of deference. It’s intensive, even hyperactive, scrutiny of the EPA’s decision to protect the environment. Instead of deferring to the agency’s lengthy, technical defense of the rule, the Supreme Court flyspecked it—just as the D.C. Circuit flyspecked the agency decision approving the 88-mile railroad in the Uinta Basin. That’s exactly the kind of “overly intrusive (and unpredictable) review” that the Supreme Court criticized the lower courts for.

It sure looks like the conservative majority is adjusting the intensity of judicial scrutiny to suit its policy preferences. When agencies downplay environmental harms, Seven County says they should get a free pass. When agencies move to protect the environment, the courts will tie them into knots.

That’s not the way administrative law is supposed to work. If deference is the touchstone in NEPA cases, it ought to be the touchstone across the board. If the Supreme Court means it when it says that “the political process, and not NEPA, provides the appropriate forum in which to air policy disagreements,” that same line of thinking should extend to other government decisions that aren’t about NEPA.","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1200,h_600,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1ecd1136-5f9e-4113-a170-bdd16f7da70e_638x821.png",N,,2025-06-02 13:16:00.729013

Enbridge spokesperson Juli Kellner said in a statement that the draft review is a significant step in the five-year review of the project.
The tunnel design already reflects that intent, and we will use the USACE’s findings from the (draft environmental review) to further refine the project,” Kellner said.
The Corps found the tunnel project is necessary as demand for oil and petroleum products will remain steady or increase through 2050.
“The draft EIS confirms this project will have only minimal and short-term impacts primarily during construction of the submerged pipeline tunnel,” Manley said.","In April, the Army Corps said it would fast-track review of a federal permit for the project under Trump’s declaration of a national energy emergency. The draft is a step toward issuing a final environmental impact statement, or EIS.

The agency’s final review will inform its decision whether to issue a permit and whether the project complies with federal regulations, including the National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA.

The Corps’ Detroit District Commander Lt. Col. Wallace Bendeff said the agency is committed to following the NEPA process despite the shortened review.

“The Detroit District continues to prepare the Final EIS and comply with all applicable legal and policy requirements, including its federal trust responsibility to Tribal Nations, the National Historic Preservation Act, the Endangered Species Act, and the National Environmental Policy Act,” Bandeff said.

The agency will issue a decision sometime this fall.

Enbridge spokesperson Juli Kellner said in a statement that the draft review is a significant step in the five-year review of the project.

“Our goal is to have the smallest possible environmental footprint. The tunnel design already reflects that intent, and we will use the USACE’s findings from the (draft environmental review) to further refine the project,” Kellner said.

Enbridge has said the project will make a safe pipeline safer. The Corps found the tunnel project is necessary as demand for oil and petroleum products will remain steady or increase through 2050.

The agency examined several main alternatives for the project that include taking no action, building the tunnel as proposed or placing a protective rock cover over the exposed segment of Line 5 on the lake bed. The review also considered options for decommissioning the existing dual pipelines in combination with Enbridge’s proposed tunnel.

Julie Goodwin, an Earthjustice attorney representing the Bay Mills Indian Community, said the Straits of Mackinac represent the center of creation for the tribe.

“It is a rich area with cultural and spiritual and economic importance to the tribe,” Goodwin said. “The Corps is not considering alternatives where no oil would flow through the Straits of Mackinac, and that’s a real problem.”

The public will be able to provide input on the agency’s findings through the end of June. Virtual hearings will be held June 18 and 25.

Environmental groups and Great Lakes tribes have condemned the agency’s move to fast-track review, saying the project poses too great a risk of an oil spill. Anne Woiwode with Michigan’s Sierra Club Chapter said in a statement it is reviewing the agency’s draft, but its position hasn’t changed.

“Line 5 remains an existential threat. Chances of an oil spill in the Great Lakes – our most valuable freshwater resource – skyrockets if this tunnel is built in the Straits. We can’t drink oil. We can’t fish or swim in oil,” Woiwode said.

The draft review said the risk of oil escaping the tunnel is “virtually zero.” The document states about 48 million gallons would need to spill over the span of around 50 hours to fill the tunnel and prompt a release.

David Holtz, who serves on Sierra Club’s board of directors, also raised concerns about the potential for methane to enter the construction area and risk an explosion. Enbridge plans to reduce that risk through ventilation and air monitoring. The Corps found it’s unlikely an explosion would occur during construction.

Scott Manley, executive vice president of government relations with Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce, said in a statement that homeowners and businesses rely on the products that Line 5 carries for heating and fuel.

“The draft EIS confirms this project will have only minimal and short-term impacts primarily during construction of the submerged pipeline tunnel,” Manley said. “Although the pipeline has operated safely in the Mackinac Straits for decades, this important project will ensure that businesses and homeowners will continue to have access to the affordable and reliable energy they need with yet another level of environmental protection.”

Enbridge reached a deal to build the Line 5 tunnel during former Michigan Republican Gov. Rick Snyder’s administration in 2018. A year later, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel sued to shut down Line 5 on behalf of Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer.

A Michigan appeals court upheld a state permit for the tunnel in February after tribes and environmental groups challenged its approval by the Michigan Public Service Commission. Tribes and groups are now asking the Michigan Supreme Court to overturn the permit.

Meanwhile, Enbridge has re-applied for multiple state permits granted for the project that were set to expire in 2026. Tribal and environmental advocates are calling on Gov. Whitmer and the Michigan’s Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy to protect the Great Lakes.

A decision has yet to be issued in Michigan’s case against Enbridge after a Michigan judge heard oral arguments earlier this year. Michigan officials allege a 1953 easement for the pipeline’s operation violated the state’s public trust doctrine and should be revoked.

Attorneys for Enbridge argue the company’s easement is valid.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/businessnorth.com/content/tncms/custom/image/f61cea88-d711-11e4-a797-d31ae85be7a2.jpg?resize=600%2C315,N,,2025-06-02 12:31:13.012291

Up to 24 hydrogen and carbon capture projects had been previously backed by the Department of Energy’s (DOE) Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations (OCED), created under the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to scale up emerging clean energy technologies.

However, the current administration has described the awards as lacking a thorough financial review.

The US Energy Secretary Chris Wright accused the Biden administration of rushing many of the projects through. “[They] failed to conduct a thorough financial review before signing away billions of taxpayer dollars,” he said.

“Today, we are acting in the best interest of the American people by cancelling these 24 awards,” Wright added.

Among the most prominent cuts are $332m for ExxonMobil’s Baytown refinery, $99m for Ørsted’s hydrogen-based clean methanol project near Houston, and $375m for Eastman Chemical’s chemical recycling facility.

In a statement, the DOE said the projects “failed to advance the energy needs of the American people, were not economically viable and would not generate a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars.”

H2 View has contacted ExxonMobil and Ørsted for comment on the proposed funding cancellations.

The Baytown hydrogen complex is set to be the largest clean hydrogen facility in the world, and it’s expected to reach a final investment decision (FID) this year.

While the major funding may now be revoked, Exxon could continue development using private capital or alternative funding.

The initiative has already attracted strong commercial interest. In May, ExxonMobil signed a long-term offtake agreement with Japan’s Marubeni Corporation for the supply of 250,000 tonnes of hydrogen-based ammonia annually, starting in 2029.

Additionally, the company has a preliminary agreement with Trammo to deliver up to 500,000 tonnes of blue ammonia from the Texas facility.

New market intelligence suggests that the recent funding cancellations are part of a broader shift that could significantly weaken North America’s position in the global low-carbon hydrogen market.

The region’s projected share of global low-carbon hydrogen capacity is now expected to fall from 46% to just 28% by 2030.

Analysts attribute the decline to mounting policy headwinds under the Trump administration, including halted federal funding and rising import tariffs, which are seen as curbing the momentum behind green hydrogen development.","https://www.h2-view.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=900,fit=contain,quality=75,metadata=none,format=auto,gravity=auto/https://www.h2-view.com/wp-content/files/shutterstock_131684321-e1743761525567.jpg",N,,2025-06-02 12:29:38.180382

Dr. Hart, a professor of public policy at George Mason University and a noted expert in energy innovation policy, highlight the importance of sustained federal investment in energy R&D.","House Republicans and the Trump administration seem to think that the road to “energy dominance” will be built by paving over the federal government. To that end, the House reconciliation bill and the presidential budget proposal would gut the Department of Energy, finishing a job that DOGE has already begun.

It’s a counterproductive approach that will kill innovations that are vital to the nation’s future. Senate Republicans should inject some common sense into the debate before it goes much further, salvaging DOE functions that both parties agreed not so long ago were essential tools in the federal kit.

The House majority and the administration are focusing energy policy on tax reform and deregulation. There are gains to be made through these approaches. Many energy tax incentives subsidize technologies that don't need them. Many regulations snarl energy projects that pose few risks to society or the environment.

But this strategy will not lead to abundant, affordable, and clean energy. Federal investment in energy research, development, and demonstration must be sustained– in fact expanded – to drive American innovation toward this goal.

Federal research and development (R&D) spending is necessary because – understandably – private companies don’t invest enough in technologies with large social benefits. This market failure strikes the energy industry particularly hard. Energy companies spend much less on R&D than other dynamic sectors. Big Tech and Big Pharma, notably, plow a large chunk of their profits back into research, generating breakthroughs like AI and GLP-1 drugs.

But these companies also recognize that work sponsored by federal agencies like the National Science Foundation (NSF) and National Institutes of Health (NIH) underpin their own investments. Since World War II, Republicans and Democrats have agreed on this logic. Federal R&D investments create foundational knowledge that enables the private sector to identify money-making opportunities, and it trains the next generation of researchers to boot.

DOE’s science and applied energy offices play similar roles. They support academic researchers as well as the national laboratory system, a unique national resource. Labs like Tennessee’s Oak Ridge and New Mexico’s Sandia, originally founded to carry out the Manhattan Project, now collaborate with the private sector to deliver innovations like new designs for nuclear power plants and improved drilling technologies.

The administration's budget for fiscal year 2026 slashes these offices. The Advanced Research Projects Agency for Energy (ARPA-E), for example, which the National Academies found to be highly effective and which has led to the creation of 167 companies and $14.6 billion in private follow-on investment since 2009, would be cut by more than 50%. Even the Offices of Nuclear and Fossil Energy, which support industries that the administration claims to like, face severe cuts.

DOE also funds programs to support technologies making the difficult transition from the lab to the market at commercial scale. These programs are as vital as the agency’s R&D investments. Just as no battle plan survives first contact with the enemy, no technology catches on with a critical mass of customers without plenty of adjustments. Each adjustment creates investment risk. Government support can make those risks acceptable to investors.

Unfortunately, many technologies that could make American energy more abundant, affordable, and sustainable, don’t survive this “valley of death.” For reasons good and bad, the energy industry is too risk-averse to seek out, test, and then adopt innovations. Even high-risk investors tend to shy away from energy startups.

Commercialization of new energy technologies is a genuine market failure. New kinds of power plants, such as those powered by underground heat or nuclear fusion, simply will not appear in the United States without DOE investments in technology demonstration, early adoption, and production scale-up. A bipartisan group of lawmakers responded to this challenge in 2022 by creating a new Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations (OCED) and expanding DOE’s Loan Programs Office (LPO).

The administration and the House Republicans would decimate these offices, following on from DOGE-driven staff cuts to the bone and beyond. The proposed FY26 budget would ratify America's pullback from the cutting edge of energy innovation.

This strategy does have one big winner: China. As in other key economic sectors, Beijing has combined legitimate investment with blatant cheating to establish dominance in critical energy technologies such as solar power and batteries. If the drive to slash DOE succeeds, China's continued expansion in energy will accelerate, rapidly cutting U.S. companies out of global markets.

Let us be clear. Some of what DOE spends money on is wasteful. We should cut programs to prop up industries that are too far gone to reclaim and technologies that have no chance of ever competing without subsidies. LPO should be reformed, to focus more tightly on helping energy companies with important technologies reach scale. OCED could be much better focused on technologies with true commercial potential. Like regulatory and tax reform, budget reform is needed. And if we are going to need fossil fuels for decades to come –and we will–those technologies too need to be explored and improved, as the Trump administration has insisted.

The current approach, though, invokes broad cost-saving justifications without a coherent strategy to advance national energy goals. It will lead to extraordinary losses: of ideas, of talent, of competitiveness, and of global influence, in a world where competitors are poised to exploit America’s retreat.

The future U.S. energy system must indeed be based on a comprehensive, forward looking strategy. But cutting energy R&D means that will not happen.

The Senate is the last line of defense against these losses. It needs to stand fast.

While this repeal would significantly raise energy costs, forcing Americans to pay more every month, another consequence has flown under the radar: If the reconciliation bill becomes law, it will threaten grid reliability and block America’s ability to meet increasing electricity demand.

After House passage, the Senate will take its turn marking up the Reconciliation bill, where Senators will face a grim proposition: Could this bill leave their constituents in the dark?

Utilities meeting rising demand with clean energy – for now

Electricity demand is growing, and future demand projections are skyrocketing. Electricity consumption grew over 3% in the last 12 months, and some estimates suggest demand will grow up to 25% by 2030, adding 120 gigawatts (GW) of peak electricity demand. This new demand is driven by the rapid increase of AI data centers and onshoring of domestic manufacturing – both of which enjoy bipartisan support in Congress and the Trump administration.

The electricity industry is meeting the moment with a surge of investment in new resources. In 2024, the U.S. grid added 51 GW of new resources, 93% of which were solar, wind and energy storage. The market is speaking loud and clear – clean energy is the fastest available resource to build to meet demand.

Most of the project pipeline is renewable energy and energy storage. Utilities that conduct long-term planning are planning to build 97 GW of solar, 36 GW of wind and 49 GW of energy storage through 2030, compared to just 61 GW of gas. The EIA estimates 70% of capacity growth in 2025 and 2026 will be solar, wind, or energy storage. And these resources are 95% of what’s seeking to connect to the grid.

In Texas’s ERCOT competitive electricity market, rapid demand increases are being met with solar and batteries. Peak demand has grown by 11 GW in five years, while ERCOT has met that growing demand with 22 GW of solar, 17 GW of wind, 8 GW of energy storage, and 3 GW of gas generation.

The North American Electricity Reliability Corporation (NERC) credits that new installed clean energy capacity with helping meet ERCOT’s rising summer peak demand, saying “lower risk is attributed to a nearly doubling of battery energy storage capacity.”

Meeting new power demand takes time – repealing tax credits would reset the clock

Utilities and market participants have a plan to meet rising demand from AI and manufacturing, and are investing billions to expand the electricity system. But the House reconciliation bill pulls the rug out from under these projects, many of which have already spent years in planning and development, risking America running out of power.

Even where new projects remain cost competitive, restructuring blown up financing arrangements and sorting through new and complex Treasury regulations will take time, leaving a resource gap the market will not be able to backfill.

Here’s why:

Planning new energy projects takes time. Projects typically need to request the right to connect to the grid an average of five years before they come online. Utilities issue requests for proposals three or four years in advance of when they need the power, resulting in signed contracts that move projects forward in the development process. Capacity markets like PJM procure three years in advance, and even these markets saw prices spike when supply could not meet rising demand forecasts. Utilities and project developers submit purchase orders years in advance for long lead items like large scale transformers.

The actual project construction phase represents the last one-to-two years of a much longer planning and development process, and by the time a project starts construction utilities and project developers have committed significant time and capital into development.

Why a budget reconciliation bill threatens grid reliability

We already know suddenly killing off federal tax credits will raise the cost of wholesale electricity 50% by 2035, but the damage goes far deeper than just cost – it threatens 150 GW of new solar, wind, and energy storage projects planned over the next five years but not yet under construction. That’s new capacity sorely needed to keep the lights on across America.

In many cases, the House reconciliation bill would kill projects that are under development, setting the process of building new resources back by years, and leaving the grid unprepared for growing demand. This means power won’t be available for new manufacturing facilities or AI data centers, forcing strategic industries to look elsewhere to meet their needs.

And worse, terminating projects already under development will leave grids unprepared for extreme weather and other unforeseen events, risking blackouts. NERC highlights growing reliability concerns in multiple grid regions as new resources struggle to keep pace with growing demand.

But NERC also says “resource additions since last summer have helped lower the risk of energy shortfalls in several areas.” Rapidly growing solar and energy storage capacity protect our grid from looming reliability risks, for now.

New gas isn’t the answer

We can’t just pivot to building more gas plants. Manufacturers’ order books are full for the next four-to-five years and plants that are not already in the planning process are unlikely to be built until 2030 or later. Gas plant costs have doubled or more in the last several years with turbines and construction labor in short supply.

Adding insult to injury the U.S. Energy Information Administration warns gas costs could rise 91% by 2026, with proposed expansion in greater liquified natural gas exports creating “additional risk over the forecast period,” further threatening cost concerns.

“We’ve got to be really careful here from an affordability standpoint about the choices we’re making,” said NextEra CEO John Ketchum. “What we don’t want to do is drive ourselves to only one solution – that being a gas-fired solution – that’s now more expensive than it ever has been in history.”

This leaves utilities and grid operators with few options. Unable to meet rising demand, utilities may hold back connecting new manufacturing facilities and AI data centers to the grid. Slowing down new capacity additions could create compounding impacts on already-rising electricity costs. And grids around the country will be underprepared for the next heatwave or cold spike.

Four U.S. Senators already stated changes to existing federal energy tax credits within the reconciliation bill should be made “without undercutting current and future private-sector investments that are vital to domestic manufacturing, energy innovation, and affordability for American families.”

With this much on the line, America’s energy policy shouldn’t put reliability at risk.

But the most impressive clean energy producer in the country isn’t on the coast; it’s in the heart of the Great Plains.

Renewables in the heart of America

South Dakota, better known for cattle ranches, cornfields and the granite faces of Mount Rushmore, is now generating a higher percentage of its electricity from renewable sources than any other state in the nation.

According to Environment America’s 2024 State of Renewables Report, South Dakota generated enough renewable energy to cover 92% of all the electricity sold in the state, with wind power being the main source.

This wasn’t the result of climate change policies or a big city initiative. It happened in a rural state, driven by simple geography and practicality.

South Dakota: A natural fit for clean power

South Dakota’s renewable transformation didn’t happen by accident. It’s rooted in the land itself.

Wind power alone generates more than half of South Dakota’s electricity. The state’s flat terrain, steady winds and open landscapes make it one of the most effective regions in the country for reliable and consistent wind. Wind energy helps South Dakota avoid more than 10 million metric tons of carbon emissions every year, the equivalent of taking 2.2 million cars off the road.

Since 2019, wind generation in South Dakota has more than quadrupled. Today, South Dakota’s 29 wind projects produce enough electricity to power more than 2 million homes, far more than the roughly 360,000 in the state.

Alongside wind, South Dakota relies on hydroelectric power, mainly major dams on the Missouri River, which accounted for 21% of the state’s power in 2023. However, hydropower comes with trade-offs, for instance, after the Missouri was dammed populations of cottonwood trees along the river plummeted, reducing nesting areas for birds and valuable habitat for countless species.

While we generally oppose hydropower, and wish to see a day when rivers like the Missouri can flow freely once again, hydropower still remains an important source of power for many communities. And while it’s not as environmentally safe as wind and solar it’s far from as harmful as pollutive fossil fuels.

Solar is still a small player in South Dakota energy, but it seems to be growing. The state generated just 4 gigawatt hours (GWh) of solar power in 2022, but thanks to improving technology, falling prices and the solar market coming to scale, in 2024, that number had grown nearly 100 fold to 346 GWh. That’s roughly enough energy to power 35,000 average U.S. homes.

South Dakota’s renewable energy success offers a blueprint for other states. By utilizing their own unique geography, climate and open land, other states can also take advantage of their inherent strengths while maintaining a diverse and robust energy grid.

Renewable energy benefits rural communities

For South Dakota and other rural states, renewable energy offers independence and community resilience.

Traditionally, rural communities have had less control over their power than most. Electricity is often generated hundreds of miles away, and prices are dictated by markets or companies far removed from the people actually using the power. With renewable energy, especially wind and solar, that’s beginning to shift.

When a local farmer leases part of their land for a wind turbine, that farm becomes a power producer. When a rural landowner installs solar arrays, the community gains a measure of control over its own energy supply. When we allow battery energy storage to be built near where we live, we can store some of that renewable energy for later. And when energy is harnessed close to where it’s used, less is lost in transmission, and more of the benefits stay local.

That kind of autonomy appeals to landowners. Renewable energy offers communities a way to meet their needs without waiting on outside actors, be it a distant utility or far-away supplier. Renewable energy provides stability during price spikes and control over their own community’s resources.

That stability also creates opportunity. Environment America and the state environmental groups in our network support renewable energy because it’s good for the environment. That’s our mission. In South Dakota, as well as other states, many people have also embraced renewable energy because it supports local economies and jobs.

In South Dakota, clean power generates more than 2,700 jobs, that includes construction crews, electrical workers, engineers, land surveyors, repair people and more. Besides cheaper energy and job opportunity, local economies also benefit from tax credits and new infrastructure, all while building a cleaner, more self-reliant future.

Renewable energy can also help communities remain resilient and functional in times of crisis, and as extreme weather grows more frequent, that kind of dependability is becoming essential. Pair wind and solar with modern battery storage, and rural communities don’t just weather storms, they thrive. Local hospitals, farms and families can stay powered even when the greater regional grid fails, and these batteries continue to get better — holding more power, becoming cheaper to produce and making renewable energy more efficient and rewarding than ever.

Beyond South Dakota: A rural energy revolution

South Dakota might be an impressive standout, but it’s far from the only state that’s getting energy from its abundant renewable resources. The U.S. produced more than three times as much solar, wind and geothermal power in 2024 than in 2015, with growth in every single state.

Across the country, other rural states are emerging as leaders in renewable energy. In 2024:

83% of Iowa’s electricity sales came from renewable sources,

Kansas generated 74%,

New Mexico hit 67%,

Wyoming reached 57%, and

Oklahoma made 54%

While these states differ politically, geographically and culturally, they share a key trait. They’re all making progress when it comes to efficiently harnessing their natural advantages, be it wind, water, sun or land, to build cleaner, healthier and more resilient energy systems.

For many of these states, clean energy isn’t a replacement for traditional industries, it’s an extension of them. The same fields that grow corn or graze cattle can also host wind turbines. The same communities that once sent goods downriver can now operate (ideally small) hydroelectric dams. The same houses, whose roofs once blocked out the beating sun, can now harness it.

Clean energy can also diversify rural economies. Wind and other renewables generate payments for landowners and tax credits for consumers. Rural America — once seen as trailing in technology and infrastructure — is now ahead of the curve when it comes to renewable energy. These states are not just producing power for themselves, but disproving myths and breaking down partisanship.

Rethinking the clean energy map

Nearly 97% of America can be considered rural land, and that land is rapidly shifting towards renewables.

The wind turbines that power South Dakota, the solar arrays that support New Mexico, the the hydropower that fuels Oregon, these aren’t fringe efforts or programs — renewables now produce enough electricity to power nearly 70 million American households. Wind and solar have become central to how many people in America are powering their lives, their homes and their businesses.

This shift matters, because it shows that clean energy is not bound by politics. It can (and should) serve everyone.

If the rest of the country is paying attention, they’ll see that the renewable energy revolution isn’t just possible, it’s already well underway. And while we have to continue fighting for renewables across the nation, it’s inspiring that the very places we once assumed would be the last to change, are the same ones leading the charge.",https://environmentamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/SD-Windmills-Ruthie-Moeckly.jpeg,N,,2025-06-02 12:29:42.920426

Environment Texas and our allies defeated major threats to clean energy and local climate action, while helping pass forward-thinking laws on rooftop solar, conservation, and the right to repair. Still, key challenges remain—from plastic pollution to PFAS “forever chemicals.” Here’s our recap of the major bills impacting the environment in the 89th session of the Texas Legislature. Note, of course, though most of the bills which passed have not yet been reviewed by the Governor, so it’s still possible some could get vetoed.

First, the bad bills that died

The Texas Senate passed a number of bills which could have ground renewable energy development to a halt, including:

SB 388 (King), which would have required that 50% of new generation come from natural gas or else make renewable energy pay steep fees to gas companies

SB 819 (Kolkhorst), which would have adopted a discriminatory and capricious permitting program for wind and solar energy

SB 715 (Sparks), which would have forced wind and solar companies to pay onerous “firming” fees

SB 383 (Middleton), which would have banned offshore wind in state waters from interconnecting with ERCOT

Thankfully, all of these bills ultimately died! One other bill started off bad – HB 3556 (Vasut), which would have allowed the state to veto certain wind energy projects – but was amended to be good policy (requiring closer consultation between wind energy developers and the parks and wildlife department).

There were also a number of attacks on transit and biking, including bills to undermine Austin’s Project Connect (SB 2519, SB 3071 and SB 2238 among others), Dallas Area Rapid Transit (HB 3187) and Harris County investments in bike infrastructure (SB 2722).

Attacks on local efforts to fight climate change (including HB 4313 and HB 4314 by Representative Cecil Bell), to prohibit cities from adopting ordinances to protect ashe juniper trees SB 1927 (Hinojosa, Adam), and to prohibit the insurance department from factoring in climate change SB 495 (Sparks) all also fortunately didn’t make it through.

Good Bills Passed

Energy

SB 1202 (King) would streamline the permitting process for rooftop solar and batteries, making it easier for Texans to install clean backup power. Bills to adopt consumer protection standards for solar customers, increase recycling of wind turbines and solar panels, and to set decommissioning and fire safety standards for battery energy storage systems, all passed.

There was some small progress on energy efficiency by passing SB 783 (Menéndez) – which allows the State Energy Conservation Office to update building energy and water conservation standards – and HB 5323 (King) which establishes a Texas Energy Waste Advisory Committee.

ERCOT will have more power to address the surging demand for electricity from data centers through SB 6 (King), including by allowing them to require data centers to use their own backup power during power grid emergencies.

Right to repair

Texas will become the first red state in America to give people more freedom to fix their own stuff, thanks to HB 2963 (Capriglione). This will be a great help in curbing electronic waste.

Water

The Devil’s River – one of the most pristine rivers in the state – will get new protections thanks to HB 3333 (Morales, Eddie), which prohibits TCEQ from issuing new permits authorizing waste or pollutants to be discharged in the river basin.

Homeowners following local watering restrictions can no longer be fined by HOAS for having brown or discolored lawns thanks to HB 517 (Harris Davila).

Walkable, Transit-friendly Neighborhoods

HB 24 (Orr) removes barriers to a variety of housing types, such as townhomes and accessory dwelling units, which can save water and energy.

Oil and gas

Abandoned oil and gas wells are too often leaking methane and contaminating groundwater. SB 1150 (Middleton) would force oil and gas companies to plug these orphan wells when they’ve been inactive for at least 15 years, while SB 1146 (Birdwell) would speed up well plugging by reducing the potential legal liability for people who own the land on which an orphaned well sits (but who don’t own the well itself).

Clean air

SB 763 (Alvarado) provides for a more regular protectiveness review of the standard permit for concrete batch plants

The Great Outdoors

SB 2232 (Hinojosa, Adam) establishes an Unplug Texas Day encouraging Texans to put down their phones and go outside and enjoy our beautiful parks.

Good Bills that Died

While there was much to celebrate, sadly some good bills ended up dying out.

Wildlife

HB 4028 (Zwiener) and SB 2441(Zaffirini) to get plastics manufacturers to end the dumping and spills of plastic pellets into our waters, and HB 1904 (Canales) to ban mass balloon releases – both major harms to wildlife – failed to make it.

HB 4212 (Curry) which would have established the Texas land, water, and wildlife conservation account to provide a permanent funding source to support conservation projects, passed the House but died in the Senate.

HB 1437 (González, Mary) which would have created a pollinator health task force, and its Senate companion, SB 2850 (Menéndez) each passed its respective chamber, but neither passed both chambers, which frustratingly means it fails to become law. Fortunately, though, the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department has agreed to update its pollinator protection plan, accomplishing a lot of what the bills would have done.

HB 5259 (Flores) to direct TPWD to develop a Wildlife Corridor Action Plan got a committee hearing, but went no further in the process.

Electric vehicles

Policies to add electric vehicle charging stations to state parking garages, HB 2145 (Bhojani), and to promote Vehicle to Grid technology, HB 3511 (Anchía), passed the House but died in the Senate.

Water

Many bills that would have promoted better water conservation standards also did not pass. Policies that would allow counties to adopt tax credits for rainwater harvesting, HB 3637 (Troxclair), and to allow Hays County to adopt water conservation standards for in unincorporated areas, HB 2347 (Zwiener), passed the House but died in the Senate.

PFAS pollution

A number of bills to address toxic PFAS pollution (known as “forever chemicals”) failed to pass, including SB 1898 (Johnson), which would ban the use of firefighting foam containing PFAS chemicals except during emergencies, and several bills to study the problem – HB 1145 (Morales Shaw) and HB 3738 (Shofner).

Don’t mess with Texas

None of the bipartisan bills to reduce litter and waste made it, including SB 728 (Johnson) and HB 2048 (Lujan), which would have created a bottle deposit program, and SB 2689 (Hancock) and HB 4839 (Walle) which would have established a new fund to promote recycling.

Clean air

Clean air was also not prioritized this session as SB 2082 (Miles), which would have prohibited the operation of concrete crushing facilities near hospitals, died.

Bad bills which passed

HB 49 (Darby) would absolve oil and gas companies of liability for contamination resulting from the discharge of treated oil and gas wastewater into waterways

SB 2078 (Kolkhorst) could discourage composting because if a city requires businesses to compost, it can’t send that food waste to another county.

Other bills of note

The budget: Lawmakers approved another $5 billion to the Texas Energy Fund. While most of the money will go to build new gas power plants, $1.8 billion will go to the Texas Backup Power Package Program, which will help install backup power, including solar and storage, at critical infrastructure such as nursing homes and water treatment plants.

Unfortunately, many of our asks of appropriators were denied. A TCEQ program which provides filters to schools which find lead in their drinking water got no funding, which means the program will likely end when federal funding runs out. TPWD had asked for an additional $30 million for the Farm and Ranch Lands Conservation Program, but instead they got the same, wholly insufficient, $2 million they got in the last biennium.",https://environmentamerica.org/texas/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Untitled-design-2025-05-30T171342.945-1024x576.png,N,,2025-06-02 12:30:29.821259

WASHINGTON — The Department of the Interior has proposed rescinding a rule put in place last year that added new restrictions on oil and gas development in the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska. Rescinding the 2024 rule will remove regulations that are inconsistent with the Naval Petroleum Reserves Production Act of 1976, restore the original intent of the Act for the management of the area, and eliminate roadblocks to responsible energy production.

After a thorough legal and policy review, Bureau of Land Management and Department officials concluded that the 2024 Bureau of Land Management rule entitled “Management and Protection of the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska” exceeds the agency’s statutory authority under the Naval Petroleum Reserves Production Act of 1976, conflicts with the Act’s purpose, and imposes unnecessary barriers to responsible energy development in the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska.

The Reserve, encompassing approximately 23 million acres on Alaska’s North Slope, was set aside by Congress for oil and gas exploration and development as a matter of national energy security and policy in reaction to the oil crisis in the 1970’s. The BLM administers the reserve pursuant to the Naval Petroleum Reserves Production Act, which mandates an “expeditious program of competitive leasing” while balancing the protection of surface resources.

“Congress was clear: the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska was set aside to support America’s energy security through responsible development,” said Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum. “The 2024 rule ignored that mandate, prioritizing obstruction over production and undermining our ability to harness domestic resources at a time when American energy independence has never been more critical. We're restoring the balance and putting our energy future back on track.”

The 2024 rule significantly expanded procedural requirements and created a presumption against oil and gas activity in approximately 13 million acres designated as “Special Areas” unless operators could prove minimal or no adverse effects on surface resources. These provisions not only lack a basis in the Naval Petroleum Reserves Production Act but undermine the BLM’s obligation to carry out an effective and timely leasing program.

The proposed rescission is consistent with recent Executive Orders issued by President Trump in January 2025—E.O. 14153 “Unleashing Alaska’s Extraordinary Resource Potential” and E.O. 14156 “Declaring a National Emergency.” These directives emphasize the urgent need to reverse restrictive policies that hinder domestic energy development and economic growth, particularly in Alaska.

Under the proposed rule rescission, the BLM would revert to the regulations that were in place prior to May 7, 2024, which have long guided responsible development in the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska while incorporating protections for wildlife, subsistence and surface values through the Integrated Activity Plan process.

The proposed rule will be published in the Federal Register and open to public comment for 60 days.

MEDINA – A federal grant for $15 million would have helped build the first-of-its-kind industrial decarbonization system at Western New York Energy.

But that project, and 23 other clean energy and manufacturing innovation projects across the country, were cancelled last week by the Trump Administration.

Skyven Technologies was looking to build the industrial decarbonization system at the ethanol plant. The company said the nationally significant project uses electrified high-temperature steam production, calling it a critical need for decarbonizing U.S. manufacturing.

Skyven said its system would have reduced annual operating costs at the ethanol plant, cut carbon local emissions, and served as a replicable model for food, beverage and chemical manufacturers across the country.

“This groundbreaking project is a major step forward in reducing carbon emissions in the industrial space,” Skyven, a Texas-based company, announced in September. “Arcturus will cut 20,000 metric tons of CO2 emissions per year from WNYE’s facility, which is equivalent to removing 4,300 cars from the road annually. And this is just the beginning of what our cutting-edge technology can achieve.”

The project had already attracted major private investment and was expected to drive an additional $150 million to the Medina site, the company said. Skyven in September announced it had been approved for a federal grant for the project.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright on Friday announced that $3.7 billion in project grants were being cancelled by the Department of Energy.

After a thorough and individualized financial review of each award, the DOW found the projects “failed to advance the energy needs of the American people, were not economically viable and would not generate a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars,” according to a press release from the DOE.

The grants were primarily targeted for carbon capture and sequestration, and decarbonization initiatives.

“While the previous administration failed to conduct a thorough financial review before signing away billions of taxpayer dollars, the Trump administration is doing our due diligence to ensure we are utilizing taxpayer dollars to strengthen our national security, bolster affordable, reliable energy sources and advance projects that generate the highest possible return on investment,” Wright said in a statement. “Today, we are acting in the best interest of the American people by cancelling these 24 awards.”",https://orleanshub.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/cropped-Hub-bookmark-icon-32x32.png,N,,2025-06-02 12:29:47.797976

The long-rumored more-affordable new Tesla has been a point of contention inside the company for years, according to countless reports. While Tesla has spent years promising to expand its lineup into more budget-friendly segments, CEO Elon Musk seems to be convinced that the way to go is to dump the steering wheel entirely—the company's future should hinge on autonomous driving and artificial intelligence, not competing with other car companies.

But according to a new report, there is—or at least was—a great deal of confusion within Tesla as to whether this potentially $25,000 electric vehicle is happening or not.

That kicks off today's edition of Critical Materials, our morning roundup of industry and technology news. Also on deck today: the legality of President Donald Trump and Congress's crackdown on EVs comes into question, and BYD is facing blowback over its price cuts. Let's dig in.

30%: War Of Words Over Tesla's Maybe-Cancelled $25,000

Tesla More Affordable Compact EV, Rendered

Everybody wants more affordable EVs. Cross the $25,000 barrier, with or without any tax incentives, and you open up zero-emission transportation to a whole new class of buyers—or really anyone fed up with how expensive new cars have become.

If any automaker could pull that off outside of China or Europe, it's Tesla. And Tesla's investors generally want the company to expand its somewhat stale lineup of cars, even as it makes big promises around AI and robots. In fact, Musk's own ""Master Plan"" from way back in 2006 promised luxury cars first, then low-cost family cars later.

So the automotive world was a bit stunned in April last year when Reuters reported that Musk had cancelled a long-awaited $25,000 EV. Musk responded by doing what he normally does in response to negative press: by saying Reuters is lying. He has since alluded to some new and more affordable models coming soon, but very little evidence of this has arisen.

Today, however, Reuters reports that senior Tesla executives were taken aback when Musk denied the car had been axed—to their knowledge, it was pretty much dead. And if it wasn't, well, other people needed to know about it:

The executives knew that Musk had, in fact, canceled the low-cost vehicle, which many investors called the Model 2, and pivoted Tesla to focus on self-driving robotaxis, the people said. The company had told employees the project was over weeks earlier, Reuters reported, citing three sources and company documents.

Musk’s post was so confusing to some senior managers that they asked him whether he’d changed his mind. Musk rejected their concerns and said the project was still dead, according to the people with knowledge of the matter.

After Musk denied the Reuters report about killing the Model 2, executives questioned Musk about what the company should tell perplexed suppliers and investors, people familiar with the matter said.

That story notes that this concern was not universally shared within the company. Some executives told Reuters that Tesla generally keeps its plans flexible for future products. Others, however, worried that the Securities and Exchange Commission could get involved if Musk ""[misled] investors about a future product line that had been baked into their forecasts for the company.

Regardless, it's now mid-2025, a more affordable Tesla is still MIA, and the going theory is that any models that do arise could be stripped-down versions of the Model Y or Model 3 and not something entirely new. We'll see what happens here, but as Tesla's lineup loses steam, rivals are catching up fast.

60%: How Legal Is Trump's EV Rollback?

Los Angeles Traffic 1950s

Trump's policies around EVs, charging and a zero-emission future represent a 180-degree handbrake turn from those of his predecessor, President Joe Biden. It started with the freezing of federal funding for EV charger networks, and as Trump's Big Beautiful Bill works its way through Congress, it could mean an end to EV tax credits and manufacturing incentives—as well as California losing its ability to set tougher emissions rules that a dozen other states follow too.

But as anyone following the news these past few months will know, many of Trump's orders and proposed policies get challenged in court, to varying degrees of success. Automotive News today speculates on what could happen here:

However, Congress used a contested method, the Congressional Review Act, to revoke the California waivers. That mechanism is meant to disapprove agency rules. For example, in 2017, Congress passed a Congressional Review Act joint resolution to disapprove a rule enacted by the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau that would have limited clauses preventing people from suing their banks.

California officials have said the state plans to sue.

If the use of the Congressional Review Act for this purpose stands, it will open up agency notices, orders, declarations, licensing and statutory interpretations to congressional review.

And as for the charging funding:

In February, the highway administration said it would review the implementation of the program, rescind previous guidance and suspend approvals for states. It said no new funds would be issued, but existing obligations would be reimbursed. As of Feb. 6, the department had obligated about $527 million of the remaining $3.3 billion.

The GAO issued a decision May 22 that said “DOT violated the recording statute” because it “treated signed project agreements as the point of obligation” rather than the time that the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act made appropriations.

The GAO said the department must release funds appropriated by Congress, which has the power of the purse, according to the Constitution. Or, it must “propose funds for rescission or otherwise propose legislation to make changes to the law for consideration by Congress,” the GAO said.

All of this is to say that things could be more up in the air than we realize.

90%: BYD Criticized For Escalating China's EV Price War

As advanced as China's EV sector is, it's got too many brands competing for too few buyers—all of which are embroiled in a brutal price war that's helping sales but is ultimately not great for profits. It also has ramifications for the stability of the entire space.

Bloomberg today reports that BYD, in particular, is getting raked over the coals for its most recent round of price cuts. In fact, the automaker's shares sank 17% amid fears that the government may have to step in:

In a commentary on Sunday, the People’s Daily — the mouthpiece of China’s Communist Party — criticized the “rat-race competition” and warned that price wars can seriously affect supply-chain security. Low-priced and low-quality products would seriously damage the international reputation of “Made-in-China,” it said, without naming any specific companies.

Also over the weekend, China’s automobile industry association warned against “vicious competition” that would hurt profit margins, impair product quality and hinder the healthy development of the industry. The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology agreed with that stance and will step up measures to root out unhealthy competition in in the auto sector and protect market order and consumer rights, media outlet Cailian reported.

BYD was at the fore of the latest round of discounting, slashing prices as much as 34% last last month in a move that was followed by rivals including Zhejiang Leapmotor Technology Co. and Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd. Analysts at Citigroup estimated that after BYD’s discounts, traffic to its dealerships may have surged between 30% to 40% week-on-week.

A price war may juice your sales in the short term, but it can have downstream effects that take years to be seen.

As tariffs create uncertainty in the US power market, development activity is likely to slow down, according to the study, entitled “All aboard the tariff coaster: implications for the US power industry”.
Under the trade tensions scenario, by the end of 2026 the US effective tariff rate settles at 10% with a 34% tariff on China.
In the trade war scenario, the US maintains an aggressive tariff policy and implements reciprocal tariffs that result in an overall effective tariff rate of 30% through 2030.
In 2024, nearly all battery cells used in US utility-scale storage projects came from China.","Recent tariff policies in the United States are set to increase the cost of power generation technologies, with energy storage seeing the biggest hike, according to a report from Wood Mackenzie.

Energy storage would be hit the hardest due to its dependence on Chinese imports and could see cost increases of up to 50%, the report warned.

As tariffs create uncertainty in the US power market, development activity is likely to slow down, according to the study, entitled “All aboard the tariff coaster: implications for the US power industry”.

Vice chairman of power and renewables at Wood Mackenzie Chris Seiple said: “In a business with five-to-10-year planning cycles, not knowing what a project will cost next year or the year after is disruptive and causes massive uncertainty for US power industry participants.

“As a result, we could see potential delays in project development and rising power purchase agreement (PPA) prices. We will definitely see impacts on power sector capital projects. The severity depends on what scenarios play out.”

Wood Mackenzie’s P&R Supply Chain Cost Hub tariff calculator was used to estimate the impact tariffs would have on the cost of power sector capital projects.

Tariff impacts are assessed using various inputs, including project and equipment cost breakdowns, as well as US import data.

The analysis looked at two scenarios – trade tensions and trade war. Under the trade tensions scenario, by the end of 2026 the US effective tariff rate settles at 10% with a 34% tariff on China. In the trade war scenario, the US maintains an aggressive tariff policy and implements reciprocal tariffs that result in an overall effective tariff rate of 30% through 2030.

Based on these scenarios, Wood Mackenzie estimates most types of technologies will experience cost increases of 6% to 11%, with utility-scale storage the exception.

In 2024, nearly all battery cells used in US utility-scale storage projects came from China. With the combination of high tariffs on China and US dependence on imports from China, Wood Mackenzie’s P&R Supply Chain Cost Hub estimates cost increases could be anywhere from 12% to more than 50% for utility-scale storage projects, depending on the tariff scenario.

Seiple added: “While US battery cell manufacturing capacity is expanding, it is not expanding at a pace nearly fast enough to meet even a small fraction of battery projects in the US.

“In 2025 we estimate there is sufficient domestic manufacturing capacity to only meet about 6% of demand and by 2030 domestic manufacturing could potentially meet 40% of demand.”

Another effect of the tariffs will be to significantly increase the cost of the US solar market, according to the report. In Wood Mackenzie’s trade tensions scenario, the cost of a utility-scale solar facility in the US will be 54% more expensive than in Europe and 85% more expensive than a new solar plant built in China.",https://renews.biz/media/27526/iberdrola_gorman-bess.jpg?width=640,N,,2025-06-02 12:30:38.931084

The US needs the EV tax credit to support our battery manufacturing investments To continue creating a resilient and competitive US-based battery and EV industry, we need to support a policy environment of certainty.
The US battery manufacturing industry is in a growth stage and relies on continued strong EV demand.","Recent investments in the US battery and Electric Vehicle (EV) manufacturing industry are key to establishing a robust supply chain and supporting job growth. Billions of dollars of investments have been driven by a powerful combination of (1) forward looking policies like state and federal vehicle standards, (2) incentives designed to kickstart a domestic battery industry, (3) automaker recognition that the future of the auto industry is electric, and (4) consumer demand for EVs.

While the rest of the world continues supporting their zero-emission commitments and races to be part of the EV economy, the Trump Administration and the 119th Congress are dismantling US industry support at nearly every turn.

Two weeks ago, Congress took the unprecedented step of revoking the authority of states to enforce standards accelerating the deployment of cleaner diesel trucks and electric passenger cars and heavy-duty trucks—a right that states have exercised for over 50 years to reduce vehicle pollution. Now, Congress and the Trump administration are attempting to use the Budget Reconciliation Bill to roll back EV manufacturing and consumers incentives, undo federal passenger vehicle fuel economy and emission standards, and add an excessive $250 annual fee on to EVs that is two-to-three times greater the taxes paid by the average gasoline driver.

These actions are not only a major setback to the deployment of EVs in the United States, but a major blow to the country’s nascent EV battery manufacturing supply.

US supply chain investments and job growth

Investment in the US EV supply chain is a smart move for creating jobs, building technology leadership in a growing industry, and lowering costs. You don’t have to look too hard to see that auto executives know EVs are the future. Even in the US, which lags behind other nations in EV adoption, 1 in 10 new vehicle sales are electric.

One critical element to success is building a robust EV supply chain here in the US. There was a flurry of supply chain investments supported by the Biden Administration and the 117th Congress, following the passage of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).

Over the past decade, approximately $198 billion in announced investments have been made in the manufacturing of batteries and electric vehicles (EVs) in the US, with the potential to create around 195,000 new jobs. Over 80% of these investments were announced after the passing of the BIL in 2022, thanks to the grants, tax credits, and subsidized loans. These policies are responsible for spurring the creation of a more reliable battery supply chain right here in the US. Notably, the states with the highest investments include Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Nevada.

Figure and calculations by EDF

Investments are being made throughout the supply chain. If we look at lithium extraction, a mineral in all lithium-ion batteries, we see the US is forecasted to be a top lithium producer in 2030 due to increased mining expansion. The Argonne National Lab found that in 2022, Australia, Chile, and China were top producers, but in 2030, the US, Argentina, and Australia will likely rise to the top. Midstream battery production was a key target of funding by the Biden Administration and the 117th Congress. This involves manufacturing battery inputs, such as cathodes, anodes, separators, electrolytes, and cells. The Argonne National Lab reported that as of 2024, there were announcements for 79 electrode and cell manufacturing facilities and 63 facilities for battery-grade components manufacturing. Lastly, the US is also rapidly expanding the production of EVs and batteries. A 2024 study by EDF found that in 2028, EV manufacturing facilities would be capable of producing 4.7 million new EVs each year, and by 2024, there were announcements that point to the yearly manufacturing capacity of 1,083 gigawatt hours of EV batteries.

The jobs associated with these investments will also stimulate local economies. A recent report by Atlas Public Policy found that as of September 2024, 31% of the jobs announced were in census tracts deemed as Justice40 disadvantaged communities, meaning they experience high environmental and socio-economic burdens. In addition, they found that 12% are in communities that have experienced economic hardships due to the decline in the fossil fuel industry. It was estimated that over 800,000 additional jobs could be created through indirect employment – the result of increased spending in communities.

But the Trump Administration and the 119th Congress are attempting to slash many of these incentives that support this growing manufacturing base, including the New Clean Vehicle tax credit (30D), the Alternative Fuel Vehicle Refueling Property Credit (30C), and the Advanced Manufacturing tax credit (45X).

These policy shifts are pulling the floor out from under the US-based battery and electric vehicle (EV) manufacturing industry, and we are already seeing the . It is clear that the reversal of these policies, tax credits, and grants, will slow the transition to EVs and is already hurting the US manufacturing base. An ICCT study estimates that repealing the IRA tax credits could result in a loss of 130,000 direct and 310,000 indirect US jobs by 2030. Most of these jobs are located in the Midwest and southern states where the manufacturing base is being established.

The net impact on jobs in 2030 if the IRA is repealed. Figure by ICCT.

We can still save the EV tax credit

This big push towards US EV manufacturing competitiveness was backed by strong demand-side policies that are at risk. The New Clean Vehicle tax credit (30D) included in the IRA reduces the cost of EVs up to $7,500, making them more affordable for middle income households. The tax credit is tied to domestic mineral sourcing and battery production restrictions, thereby designed to incentivize automakers to bring manufacturing to the US and diversify material sourcing to countries with trade agreements, sometimes referred to as “friendshoring”. Unfortunately, this tax credit is slated for elimination in the bill passed by the House in May, therefore creating more market uncertainty for the battery and EV industry. The current proposal eliminates it for most EVs in 2026 and the credit would go away completely by 2027. The Used Clean Vehicle tax credit (25E) is eliminated entirely, reducing accessibility for lower income households looking to switch to electric.

In addition, long-term industry-wide vehicle pollution standards play a crucial role, providing automakers with more certainty and direction for their R&D investments and enabling companies to compete on a level playing field. The EPA vehicle standards reduce global warming pollution, soot, and smog forming pollution. They incentivize manufacturers to increase the availability of clean vehicles that meet drivers needs. While this has been proven to be an effective approach to cleaning our air, it is now on the chopping block. As noted earlier, Congress has already moved to block states from implementing standards to bring more electric vehicles to dealers’ lots while the House has included provisions in the budget reconciliation bill to undermine federal fuel economy and emission standards.

These drastic policy changes, along with constantly changing tariff policies, are already hurting battery manufacturing investments. We are seeing stalled U.S. manufacturing investments, which, if they continue, could halt job production, harm our competitiveness in the global market, compromise supply chain security, and slow decarbonization.

However, the House changes are not baked into law—yet. The reconciliation bill is currently being considered in the Senate and several Senators have expressed an interest in tweaking tax provisions in the House bill. Until both chambers approve the same text there’s a chance cooler heads can prevail. President Trump wants the bill on his desk by Independence Day. Will the future of EV manufacturing go out with a bang? Or will drivers maintain freedom to choose the clean vehicle that best fits their needs? Your member of Congress needs to hear from you as soon as possible before these changes are baked in.

The US needs the EV tax credit to support our battery manufacturing investments

To continue creating a resilient and competitive US-based battery and EV industry, we need to support a policy environment of certainty. There have been three steadying strategies to building the US battery economy – invest in US manufacturing, amplify demand signals, and create strong and diversified partnerships with producing countries. The recent rollback of promised government funding and the current threat to the EV tax credits add to the environment of uncertainty that will hurt the US manufacturing base.

There’s no way around it – slashing incentives to build a US EV supply chain is a major blow at a critical moment. The US battery manufacturing industry is in a growth stage and relies on continued strong EV demand. The combination of demand and supply-side policies is the strategy that provides the best chance of successfully creating a resilient and competitive battery supply chain so that the US automotive companies lead in the global car market and American workers can build the cars of the 21st century.",https://blog.ucs.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/vw-plant-chatanooga.jpg,N,,2025-06-02 11:25:37.534567

Rand Paul of Kentucky has already indicated he opposes the bill because it will ""explode the debt.""
Including interest, the House bill would increase the debt by $3.1 trillion, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.
I'm worried that the House bill goes way too far in that regard,"" Hawley said in a CNN interview.
In the Senate, the deduction is not an issue, since none of the blue states have Republican senators.
The House-passed bill includes a $4 trillion debt ceiling hike, while the Senate's budget blueprint contained a $5 trillion increase.","Washington — The Senate this week is taking up the massive budget package containing President Trump's second-term agenda, a measure that squeaked through the House with a one-vote margin, solely with Republican votes. Its path through the Senate seems destined to be similarly narrow, with the package almost certain to be revised, since parts of it are opposed by a handful of GOP senators critical to its passage.

House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, recently ventured to the other side of the U.S. Capitol to remind Republican senators ""that we are one team"" and pleaded with them to keep the bill substantially intact.

""I encouraged them to make as few modifications as possible, remembering that I have a very delicate balance on our very diverse Republican caucus over in the House,"" Johnson said in an interview with ""Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.""

Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, acknowledged that balance, but told reporters ""the Senate will have its imprint"" on the bill. He can afford three ""no"" votes from Republicans if all Democrats vote to block its passage in the Senate, and there are no absences.

GOP Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky has already indicated he opposes the bill because it will ""explode the debt."" Including interest, the House bill would increase the debt by $3.1 trillion, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. Similar to the House, in the Senate, there are Republicans who think there's not enough cost cutting, while others argue some provisions are too draconian.

These are the key sticking points as the legislation moves to the Senate:

Medicaid changes

Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Josh Hawley of Missouri are among the Republicans who have expressed concern about some of the changes to Medicaid, a government program that provides health care to low-income Americans as well as those with disabilities. And the trio of senators supported an amendment to the budget resolution earlier this year that would have removed the language instructing the committee overseeing Medicaid to make $880 billion in cuts. That amendment failed.

The House-passed legislation includes new work requirements that would apply to childless Medicaid recipients without disabilities between the ages of 19 and 64. It also requires states to conduct more frequent eligibility checks on Medicaid recipients to root out waste, fraud and abuse, and it would penalize states that provide state-funded health care to undocumented immigrants. The bill also seeks to lower federal costs by freezing states' provider taxes at current rates and prohibiting them from establishing new provider taxes, among other changes.

While these Senate Republicans have generally been supportive of the work requirements, some have warned that they will not support the bill if it includes any cuts to Medicaid benefits.

In a New York Times opinion piece published earlier this month, Hawley called ""slashing health insurance for the working poor"" both ""morally wrong and politically suicidal.""

A handful of senators have also warned of the impact of freezing provider taxes at current levels, since states use the taxes to help fund their share of Medicaid costs, although Murkowski has expressed support for this. Hawley said he's concerned about the impact on rural hospitals, while also voicing opposition to new copay requirements for beneficiaries.

""I don't like the idea of decreasing funding for rural hospitals. I'm worried that the House bill goes way too far in that regard,"" Hawley said in a CNN interview. ""I also don't like what is basically a hidden tax on working poor people who are trying to get health care. I mean, this whole idea of we're going to charge them now additional copays in order to access healthcare — I have to say, that just sounds like a tax to me.""

Deeper spending cuts

Meanwhile, a number of fiscal hawks have balked at the bill's spending cuts or even threatened to oppose the measure without securing deeper cuts, echoing the frustration expressed on the other side of the Capitol by members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus throughout negotiations on the package.

Sen. Ron Johnson, a Wisconsin Republican, said the package's aim to cut $1.5 trillion ""isn't squat, quite honestly."" And Sen. Rick Scott, a Florida Republican, has also rebuffed the cuts, saying the amount is ""not going to do it.""

""Their bill would not pass in the Senate, and I think there's plenty of us that would vote against it,"" Scott told reporters earlier this month, adding that the upper chamber should go through every line in the budget to find savings.

Sen. Roger Marshall, a Kansas Republican, said ""the job of the Senate is to try to increase the cuts in spending,"" calling the House cuts a ""great start"" while urging the Senate to hit $2 trillion. And Sen. Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican, told the network that he believes ""the Senate is going to cut spending more than the House.""

""We're going to see the Senate be more fiscally conservative,"" Cruz added.

Rolling back IRA clean energy tax credits

The House-passed bill would also roll back some of the clean energy tax credits under the Biden-era climate and health care law, including an earlier phasing out of a tax break for clean energy vehicles. But the provisions could face opposition in the upper chamber.

Last month, Murkowksi, along with GOP Sens. John Curtis of Utah, Jerry Moran of Kansas and Thom Tillis of North Carolina, penned a letter to the Senate majority leader to ""emphasize the importance of maintaining a stable and predictable tax framework to promote domestic energy development.""

""While we support fiscal responsibility and prudent efforts to streamline the tax code, we caution against the full-scale repeal of current credits, which could lead to significant disruptions for the American people and weaken our position as a global energy leader,"" the group wrote.

Tillis told reporters after the House passed the bill that the Senate needs to ""look at the specifics"" of revising the clean energy tax credits, saying ""we've got to make sure the businesses who believe the government was setting this as a priority don't have a lot of stranded costs.""

At the same time, other Senate Republicans, like Johnson, have called for eliminating the clean energy tax credits, setting up a possible clash within the conference.

State and local tax deduction

Among the provisions that spurred extensive debate in the House was one allowing residents to deduct more in state and local taxes on their federal returns, known as SALT. Divisions over an increase to the SALT cap threatened to sink the package in the days leading up to its passage in the lower chamber as a handful of blue-state Republicans fought for a higher cap, ultimately settling for $40,000, an increase from $10,000.

In the Senate, the deduction is not an issue, since none of the blue states have Republican senators. Accordingly, a number of Senate Republicans have indicated that they oppose its inclusion in the bill.

""Eliminate it,"" Johnson, the Wisconsin senator, told reporters of the SALT cap increase.

Republican Sen. Kevin Cramer of North Dakota told The Hill that the cap could potentially be cut in half once the Senate makes its changes.

But the House speaker said he warned senators that changing the provision would not only risk getting it through the lower chamber again, but also the Republican majority.

""In the House, we do have a number of members who are elected in places like New York and California and New Jersey, and they have to provide some relief to their constituents,"" the Louisiana Republican told ""Face the Nation."" ""Those are what we call our majority makers. Those are the people who are elected in the toughest districts and help us have the numbers to keep the majority in the House, and so, this is political reality.""

Debt ceiling

Fiscal hawks are also unhappy with the inclusion of a provision raising the debt ceiling by trillions of dollars. The House-passed bill includes a $4 trillion debt ceiling hike, while the Senate's budget blueprint contained a $5 trillion increase. The debate comes as Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told congressional leaders earlier this month that the federal government could be unable to pay its bills as soon as August if Congress doesn't act.

Paul has been the most vocal in opposing an increase to the debt limit. The Kentucky Republican has said ""there's nothing fiscally conservative about expanding the debt ceiling more than we've ever done it before."" Paul said he could be convinced to support the package if the debt ceiling provision is removed and voted on separately.

Instead, Paul has proposed a short-term increase of $500 billion, raising the debt ceiling for a matter of months, which he said would allow conservatives to verify that spending cuts have actually been implemented before approving a further hike.

""If I vote for the $5 trillion debt, who's left in Washington that cares about the debt?"" Paul said Sunday on ""Face the Nation."" ""The GOP will own the debt once they vote for this.""

Paul's Senate colleague, Johnson, also backs splitting the package into multiple parts, as well as a smaller, short-term extension.

Food stamps

The package also cuts billions in federal dollars from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as SNAP or food stamps. The change will require states to cover a share of the costs to provide benefits that help low-income individuals and families pay for groceries. Currently, the program is fully funded by the federal government, although states take on some of the cost to administer it. Beginning in 2028, states will have to chip in for the program as well.

""That's something that I heard some members voice concern about,"" Sen. John Boozman, an Arkansas Republican, said before Memorial Day. ""So, we'll need to address that.""

Senate Begins Putting Its Stamp on Giant Trump Tax, Debt Limit Bill Back to video

Senate Republicans plan to use a budget gimmick that counts the extension of the individual provisions in the 2017 Trump tax bill as having no cost. That gives them room to make the additional business tax cuts and possibly extend some of the new four-year individual cuts in the House bill like those on tips and overtime.

Among its numerous proposed amendments to U.S. income tax law, the Bill would eliminate, for most future projects, the federal clean electricity production tax credit and clean electricity investment tax credit, which had each previously been expanded under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the ""IRA""). The Bill also imposes broad ""prohibited foreign entities"" restrictions. These restrictions purport to (1) limit parties that can claim tax credits if owned by restricted foreign persons and (2) disqualify projects that receive certain assistance from restricted foreign persons. However, some projects may benefit from the Bill, most notably those intended to qualify for the tax credit for clean transportation fuel production.

This memorandum summarizes certain key provisions of the Bill affecting these tax credits and highlights planning considerations for investors in the affected industries. Based on messaging from senators, including Republican senators, following the passage of the Bill by the House of Representatives, we anticipate the Senate will seek to revise the Bill in ways that will at least partially narrow the scope of the changes contained in the Bill. We also anticipate that the drafting for certain provisions will need to be clarified in future iterations of the Bill, in order to streamline its implementation.

Current Law

Under the IRA, a 10-year production tax credit (""PTC"") is available for certain facilities that generate electricity with zero net greenhouse gas emissions, which can include both wind and solar energy facilities. An investment tax credit (""ITC"") equal to a percentage of a taxpayer's investment in such facilities, as well as in property used for the storage of electricity, hydrogen, or thermal energy (""energy storage technology"" or ""EST""), is also available. Under the IRA, the PTC and the ITC are each subject to a gradual phase-out that would begin for facilities and EST that start construction two calendar years after the year in which annual U.S. greenhouse gas emissions from the production of electricity are 25% or less of their 2022 level (but in no case earlier than 2032).

In addition, in lieu of claiming the PTC or the ITC, the IRA permits certain taxpayers to transfer the credits by selling them to another taxpayer in exchange for a payment in cash or cash equivalents.

Proposed Changes

ACCELERATED SUNSET DATE

Under the Bill, the PTC and the ITC would be eliminated for clean energy generation projects or EST that either (i) begin construction more than 60 days after the date the Bill is enacted into law or (ii) are placed in service after December 31, 2028. An exception would apply for certain nuclear facilities (and certain expansions of existing nuclear facilities, in the case of the PTC) that begin construction no later than December 31, 2028. Thus, clean energy generation facilities or EST would be ""grandfathered"" and remain potentially eligible to qualify for the credits under the current IRA rules (including after enactment of the Bill, but subject to the limitations on transactions with foreign entities summarized below), if they (i) have already begun construction or will begin construction no more than 60 days after the Bill's date of enactment and, in each case, will be placed in service before December 31, 2028 or (ii) have already been placed in service and qualified for a PTC or ITC.

In addition, certain projects that began construction prior to 2025 and which qualify for the previous versions of the PTC or ITC (i.e. under Sections 45 and 48 of the Internal Revenue Code (the ""Code"")), rather than the version of the PTC and ITC introduced by the IRA (i.e. under Sections 45Y and 48E of the Code), would remain eligible for these pre-IRA version of these credits (importantly without the restrictions on transactions with foreign entities imposed by the Bill).

Beginning in 2026, the Bill would eliminate the PTC and ITC for residential solar leases, though this change is expected to practically impact only a small number of states whose laws impede rooftop solar companies from directly entering into power purchase agreements with customers (and where leasing is therefore more prevalent as an alternative). This prohibition would also apply to residential wind leases.

BONUS CREDITS GENERALLY PRESERVED

Any entitlement to bonus credits (or ""adders"") for qualifying projects would be preserved under the Bill, including the ""energy community"" adder and the ""domestic content"" adder. However, the Bill would cut off the ITC low-income community bonus credit program after 2028. Any projects seeking to receive an allocation under this program would need (in addition to being ITC-eligible) to be placed in service no later than December 31, 2028 or four years after the date of the allocation, if later.

TRANSFERABILITY GENERALLY PRESERVED

The ability of taxpayers to sell PTCs and ITCs for clean energy generation or EST projects to other taxpayers would be preserved for both new and existing projects. An earlier draft of the Bill had proposed to eliminate transferability for certain new projects, but this change would have been largely redundant in light of the accelerated sunset date for such credits. Restrictions on transferability could yet be reintroduced when the Senate takes up the Bill.

EXTENSION FOR CLEAN TRANSPORTATION FUELS

The Bill would extend the clean fuel production tax credit under Code Section 45Z (the ""45Z credit"") for sales of sustainable aviation fuels and other clean transportation fuels through 2031. This credit was scheduled to expire in 2027 under the IRA. Further, the criteria for the lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions analysis used to determine eligibility for the 45Z credit appears to be more generous than under the IRA.

However, the Bill would impose new restrictions to qualify for the 45Z credit. Notably, in order to qualify for the credit, the fuel would need to be ""exclusively"" derived from feedstock produced or grown in the United States, Mexico, or Canada. Transferability of the 45Z credit would also be eliminated for credits generated by sales of fuel occurring after 2027.

ELIMINATION OF OTHER CREDITS

Several other credits relating to electric vehicles (""EV"") and their related infrastructure would be eliminated after 2025, including the Code Section 30C credit (for installation of EV charging stations), the Code Section 30D credit (for buyers of new clean vehicles), and the Code Section 45W credit (for buyers of commercial clean vehicles). In the case of the Section 45W credit, an exception would apply for vehicles acquired pursuant to a written contract entered into before May 12, 2025 that are placed in service prior to 2033.

The Bill would also eliminate the production and investment tax credits for hydrogen facilities for projects that begin construction after 2025. The transferability of credits generated by existing hydrogen projects would be preserved.

The Bill would accelerate the phase-out of the Code Section 45X advanced manufacturing production credit from 2033 to 2028 for wind energy components and from 2033 to 2032 for all other eligible components. Transferability of the credit would be eliminated for credits generated by sales of eligible components occurring after 2027.

The Bill would also accelerate the phase-out of the Code Section 45U zero-emission nuclear power production tax credit from 2033 to 2032 while preserving the transferability of the credit.

RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSACTIONS WITH FOREIGN ENTITIES

The Bill would prohibit taxpayers that engage in certain transactions with foreign entities from claiming tax credits. These prohibitions fall into two categories: (1) restrictions related to ownership, funding and services (the ""prohibited foreign entity"" restrictions) and (2) restrictions related to procurement and construction (the ""material assistance"" restrictions). These prohibitions were added to the Bill primarily to address the direct and indirect reliance of the clean energy industry on the Chinese supply chain and some of these prohibitions apply to existing, operating projects in addition to new projects.

If enacted, the prohibited foreign entity restrictions would take effect in two phases, with certain requirements applicable to taxable years beginning after the date of enactment and a second, more stringent, set of requirements taking effect for taxable years beginning more than two years after the date of enactment. These restrictions would apply to all of the tax credits discussed above, with the exception of the EV tax credits and the pre-IRA PTC and ITC credits.

The material assistance restrictions would apply to projects that begin construction after 2025. In contrast to the prohibited foreign entity restrictions, the material assistance restrictions would apply only to the Code Section 45X advanced manufacturing production credit and the post-IRA versions of the PTC and ITC under Code Sections 45Y and 48E.

Observations

IMPLICATIONS FOR EXISTING PROJECTS

Due to the grandfathering provisions contained in the Bill described above, projects that are currently operational or that have begun construction generally would remain eligible for the PTC and the ITC as well as for the credit transferability provisions of the IRA. However, unless a project began construction before 2025 and qualifies for the pre-IRA PTC and ITC (under Code Sections 45 and 48), owners of the project would still be subject to the Bill's new restrictions on transactions with foreign entities and could become ineligible to claim the tax credits or be subject to recapture of ITCs in future taxable years after such restrictions take effect.

IMPLICATIONS FOR NEW PROJECTS

The Bill passed by the House of Representatives reflects a shift in energy policy, as the Bill aggressively moved up the sunset date originally proposed by the Ways & Means Committee for many of the clean energy tax credits. It may be advisable for investors and developers to start planning for how to grandfather projects in development through the start of construction safe harbor, which requires a taxpayer to either (1) begin physical construction on site or (2) incur 5% of expenditures with respect to a project. Projects that do not begin construction by the date that is 60 days after the date of enactment of the Bill would be ineligible for any PTC or ITC.

Historically, whenever the PTC and ITC were scheduled to sunset, eligibility for the credits was based on when a project started construction. The new Bill would make PTC and ITC eligibility dependent, in part, on the timeframe for a project to be ""placed in service."" This would likely generate renewed focus on construction schedules and appropriate risk mitigants by developers, investors, and lenders.

IMPLICATIONS OF FOREIGN TRANSACTION PROHIBITIONS ON EXISTING AND NEW PROJECTS

The Bill's prohibitions on foreign ownership and assistance are complex and drafted broadly such that they could potentially capture inadvertent indirect transactions with certain foreign entities and many of the prohibitions

could apply to existing projects in addition to future projects. U.S. investors and developers are advised to speak to their tax advisors on how these new prohibitions may apply to them.

Utilities are hardening the grid with regionally specific, durable infrastructure.","The U.S. grid is under unprecedented pressure. Along with increasingly severe weather events, skyrocketing demand from data centers and electric vehicles (EVs) reveals a need for significant investment in a system built for the previous era.

That pressure is only mounting. Over the past 10 years alone, the U.S. has seen twice the number of weather-related outages compared to the previous decade. On the other hand, the thirst for energy keeps increasing, with power demand expected to reach a new high of 4,244-billion kWh in 2026.

COMMENTARY

While many utilities are hardening infrastructure by upgrading poles and wires—a necessary step—brute force solutions alone won’t be enough. To truly future-proof the grid, resilience must be rooted in intelligence via systems that anticipate, adapt, and respond dynamically.

Why Grid Hardening Can’t Wait

Over the next five years, electricity consumption will rise dramatically, in tandem with artificial intelligence (AI) usage, and a resulting spike in demand for data centers is a driving force behind this. By 2030, the U.S. is expected to consume more electricity for data processing than for all other energy-intensive manufacturing goods combined, including aluminum, steel, cement, and chemicals.

EVs have earned a reputation as a greener substitute for gas-powered vehicles by helping slash air pollution and carbon emissions. But they also bring a new kind of pressure to the grid. In 2023, EV charging pushed electricity use in the transportation sector to 18.3 TWh—enough to power approximately 1.7 million homes for a year, per the data provided by EIA. And with battery-powered EVs on the rise, that demand is expected to climb to 131 TWh by 2030. This is equivalent to powering more than 12 million average American homes year-round.

On top of the growing demand on an aged system, the increased frequency and intensity of extreme storms, wildfires, winter storms, flooding, and heat waves are now revealing weak areas in the grid. Weather accounted for 80% of all the major U.S. power disruptions between 2000 and 2023. This figure seems extreme at face value, yet it is the unfortunate reality: Most electricity flows through above-ground infrastructure, including utility poles, transformers, and transmission lines. Consequently, they remain vulnerable to high winds, torrential rain, ice storms, lightning, and heat waves. The American power system was not designed to withstand the extremes of modern-day severe weather.

Building Collaboration Into Long-Term Grid Strategy

Much of the grid infrastructure was built with a 50-to-80-year life span. This has meant that reactive hardening has often been the chosen plan of action for many utility companies. However, piecemeal fixes are prone to missing the most vulnerable areas, passing the problem down the line, and resulting in expensive and time-consuming recurring repairs.

One example of cascading grid failure is the 2003 North American Blackout, which left 50 million people without power across eight U.S. states and Ontario, Canada. It started with small transmission line failures and plant closures brought on by poor communication, software glitches, and operator errors. Overloaded lines and system failures set off a quick cascade, halting subways, water systems, hospitals, and communication networks in seconds.

The incident revealed how localized issues, if not managed with a system-wide perspective, can spiral into full-scale grid collapse. However, with a comprehensive, grid-wide hardening strategy, secondary failures are not only predictable but preventable.

True grid resilience requires more than simply upgrading physical assets; it demands a shift in mindset from patchwork maintenance to long-lasting, system-wide planning. Integrating long-term hardening means designing for the future severe weather, not reacting to the last storm. It also means rethinking how utilities plan and implement infrastructure upgrades, starting with breaking down silos across departments.

Engineering teams may know which components are aging or overloaded, but without input from the finance team, the engineering team could propose solutions that are technically sound but economically unsustainable. This could lead to great reliability, but affordability for ratepayers could take a direct hit. Conversely, finance teams may prioritize low-cost fixes that don’t address underlying vulnerabilities, leading to a seemingly affordable rate for ratepayers until the next weather event, and thus could undermine the reliability of the grid. Operations teams, who have boots on the ground, often understand the system’s day-to-day fragility better than anyone, but they are rarely brought into strategic planning early enough to make a difference.

The price of energy emergencies must be considered in the total cost of ownership, which ultimately sits with the customer. The utility must plan and pay upfront for a smart capital investment in a resilient and reliable grid or pay after the disaster. Post-event costs are typically several orders of magnitude higher, and lives are lost in the most unfortunate cases.

When these functions operate in isolation, long-term hardening efforts are fragmented at best and counterproductive for the various stakeholders at worst. In contrast, when departments align around a shared resilience framework and bridge the gap between the field and office teams, utilities can make smarter, more durable investments. A perfect balance would result in smart capital investment that balances reliability, resilience, and affordability.

Hardening with Intelligence

Physical grid infrastructure hardware has come a long way since its predecessors that were designed and implemented in the 1960s and 1970s. Utility companies now have access to AI-era solutions and physical upgrades.

Utilities are hardening the grid with regionally specific, durable infrastructure. Fire-resistant poles made of steel or composites provide more durability than wood during severe heat events, and covered conductors are replacing bare wires in wildfire-prone regions like California to lower ignition hazards. Raised substations, with waterproofed components, are also being built in coastal and flood-prone areas to keep operations running during storm surges.

Although these physical improvements are vital, grid resilience in 2025 must also use smart solutions. AI, predictive analytics, intelligent automation, and real-time monitoring solve the vulnerabilities hardware alone cannot fix—allowing the grid to predict disruptions, react in real time, and quickly recover when failures happen.

AI-driven analytics and phasor measurement units (PMUs) are disrupting how utilities monitor and manage transmission systems. By collecting data on electrical waves, PMUs enable utilities to identify early indicators of equipment stress, voltage fluctuations, or grid instability. AI and machine learning algorithms improve this capacity by analyzing data sets from sensors and smart meters to forecast equipment failures, isolate faults, and maximize dispatch decisions.

When coupled with drones, AI can also be used to strengthen the grid, as this technology combination is ideal for reaching remote or potentially hazardous locations. For instance, Southern California Edison now uses AI-powered drones for image analysis, surveying 50,000 square miles of high-risk territory.

Moreover, smart segmentation and self-healing networks are changing the way utilities find and handle outages. Self-healing networks can find a fault, isolate it, and reroute power—often in a few seconds. This is possible through the combination of automated switching, real-time data monitoring, and grid-edge intelligence, which reduces downtime and stops network-wide outages.

By integrating distributed energy resources (DERs), such as rooftop solar, battery storage, and local generators, these systems can also maintain service to critical facilities and customers even if disconnected from the main grid. For example, DERs can be sent exactly when and where they are needed. When combined with smart meters and grid sensors, DERs allow a utility to keep hospitals, emergency responders, or critical industrial operations online during a significant outage.

The U.S. grid is faced with a plethora of modern-day difficulties—ones it was not built to manage—and physical improvements are only one part of the answer. Combining the strength of physical upgrades with the intelligence of AI helps the grid not only resist the pressures of rising demand and severe weather but also foresee and adapt to these stresses. Smarter, data-driven grids could pave the way for a more resilient, reliable, efficient, and sustainable power system for the American ratepayer.",https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/fig1-power-grid.jpg,N,,2025-06-02 12:30:42.524319

Depending on eligibility, customers can receive US$1,100 per kWh of storage and US$3,100 per kW of solar.

To apply, customers need to verify that they meet the low-income criteria of at or below 80% of the area median income and then contact an SGIP-approved developer.

The SGIP Advanced Payment Program provides customers with 50 percent of the SGIP incentive in advance, allowing them to avoid out-of-pocket costs until the system is installed and the complete SGIP incentive is secured.

When customers reserve funds, they have up to a year to comply with the programme requirements before receiving the incentive.

CPUC says the one-year period gives customers time to enroll in a demand response programme, which will shift their electricity consumption in response to grid demands.

The CPUC’s intent to utilise IRA tax credits to fund the systems comes at an interesting time, given that the US House Ways and Means Committee recently submitted the budget reconciliation bill, which looks to roll back IRA measures majorly.

The bill includes several proposals, such as ending Section 25D residential energy tax credits by the end of this year, cutting the investment tax credit (ITC) for large-scale projects by 2028 at the latest, completely phasing out the Production Tax Credit (PTC) after 2031, and terminating the 45X Advanced Manufacturing and Clean Hydrogen Tax Credits earlier than anticipated.

__

In April, the United Nations University Institute for Environment and Human Security (UNU-EHS) launched the 2025 Interconnected Disaster Risks report, which examines why necessary actions are not taken to address climate change despite decades of warnings by scientists – as well as what is preventing these actions. While previous editions of the report analysed how the disasters are interconnected, and what risk tipping points the world will reach if humanity continues to weaken the systems humans depend on, this year’s edition asked a crucial question: “how do we change course?”

In an exclusive interview with Earth.Org, Irmak Karakislak, senior expert at the UNU-EHS and lead author of the Interconnected Disaster Risks report, explains that the world can build on the change that is already happening.

An Interview With Irmak Karakislak

EO: “If we know what we need to do, then why are we not doing it?” This is a crucial question the report addressed. What are your thoughts on this attitude of humans, especially considering climate change is intensifying?

Karakislak: Most people agree that we should protect our ecosystems, stop pollution, reduce waste, and so many people around the world are trying to make changes for these goals. We recycle, plant trees or support climate-friendly causes — and these efforts matter. However, our report highlights a key challenge: we often stop at surface-level or superficial fixes and fail to confront the deeper systems and mindsets that created the crisis in the first place.

For example, our rivers are polluted with plastic waste, which leads to floods, ecosystem damage and health risks. In response, we often focus on recycling, which helps, but doesn’t solve the root problem of why we have so much plastic waste to begin with. The real issue is the “take-make-waste” model of production and consumption, where we extract resources, use them and then throw them away. The assumption that resources are endless, that newer is always better or that waste is someone else’s problem is causing this issue. Our report shows that we need to go deeper to rethink the very ideas of waste, consumption and value.

EO: Why is it difficult – and appears almost impossible – for humans to really take required steps to stop emissions and halt climate change?

Karakislak: One of the biggest reasons is that we are not tackling the deeper, systemic forces driving the climate crisis. Our societies are built on long-standing assumptions about how the world should work and they often go unquestioned. These include ideas like infinite growth, the separation between humans and nature, or the belief that economic value matters more than our well-being or sustainability. In our report, we introduce the Theory of Deep Change, a framework that helps us to explore these hidden layers – the mindsets, beliefs, and structures shaping our everyday decisions. The good news is that these deeper ideas are not set in stone. They are socially constructed, built over time by people, meaning that they can change.

It seems difficult, but such deeply ingrained beliefs can shift. Think about smoking, for example. It was once considered completely normal behaviour, you could smoke in restaurants, offices, even airplanes. Over time, as we recognized the health risks and began to change public perceptions, laws and norms followed. The same kind of shift is possible in how we relate to the environment and climate. It requires a transformation in how we think, what we value and how we imagine the future. But even when we know what needs to change, actually making those changes can be daunting. This is often referred to as the Delta of Doom – a space where solutions are known, but implementation becomes stalled due to conflicts of interest, fear and systemic resistance. Navigating this space requires strong collective will and governance to overcome the inertia and push through toward meaningful, lasting change.

EO: Are governments and other institutions doing enough to address climate change?

Karakislak: There are many ongoing efforts being made by governments and institutions to address the climate crisis, but the reality is that they are often fragmented, short-term or insufficient in scale. Most of the current solutions stay as superficial fixes that do not challenge the root causes of our problems. What we keep returning to in our work is the need for truly global cooperation, because the problems we face are deeply interconnected, and so are the solutions.

A powerful example of what is possible is the Montreal Protocol, a landmark agreement where countries came together to phase out ozone-depleting substances. It has been highly successful: the ozone layer is expected to fully recover by 2066. This is proof that collective, multilateral action can work. We need more of these ambitious, cooperative efforts to address today’s challenges.

EO: The report outlines five key changes to achieve a desirable future. How can key stakeholders such as the governments and advocacy groups effectively implement these changes?

Karakislak: Our report introduces the idea of deep change, which occurs at two levels called inner and outer levers. Inner levers relate to shifting mindsets, values and assumptions with the aim to redefine what is possible. Outer levers are about structural change like new policies, governance models or investments. These two levers must work together to ensure deep, long-lasting change.

One of the five key changes we explore is the shift from short-term thinking towards long-term thinking, so we can leave a liveable and thriving world for future generations. This begins with an inner shift like caring about the well-being of those who come after us. But it must also be supported by outer lever mechanisms, such as committees for the future. These are often parliamentary or governmental bodies that formally advise on long-term impacts. These committees already exist in countries like Chile, Finland, Wales, the Philippines and even within the European Commission. They are practical ways to integrate future-thinking into decision-making.

EO: Despite decades of warnings from scientists, not much has been done to reverse climate change. How do you think the five key changes outlined in the report will translate into desired results?

Karakislak: While we know so much about the climate crisis and yet still struggle to act decisively is the central question driving our report. Part of what we found is that change is already happening in many places, and these examples can inspire and guide broader transformation. One of the five key changes we outline is about realigning our relationship with nature. When we treat nature as separate from us, as something to control or extract from, we create cascading risks.

But ecosystems can recover when we change our approach and give them the chance. In the US, the Kissimmee River in Florida was once altered for navigation, causing widespread ecological damage. When the river’s natural flow was restored, biodiversity and water quality began to rebound, proving that healing is possible when we work with nature rather than against it.

Another example is from Kamikatsu, Japan, a small town that recycles over 80% of its waste by sorting it into 45 categories. The community took on this ambitious approach entirely by itself and became a global model for zero-waste living along the way. These kinds of community-driven efforts show that, with the right values, tools and support, we can get desired results.

EO: What challenges do you think may arise in the application of the Theory of Deep Change?

Karakislak: Like any framework, the Theory of Deep Change comes with limitations. One of the biggest challenges is that change is highly context-dependent. What sparks transformation in one place might not work well in another. So, applying the theory requires local sensitivity, inclusive dialogue and collaboration among changemakers across regions.

Another challenge is that current systems, as flawed as they are, benefit certain groups. There can be resistance to change, but the cost of not changing is far greater. We are experiencing risks that threaten to trigger cascading disasters, from the climate crisis to food and water insecurity. The deeper shifts we propose in this report are urgently necessary. Change is not without difficulty, but it holds the opportunity to build systems that are fairer, more sustainable and resilient.

EO: What last thoughts would you like to share with our readers?

Karakislak: With so many crises happening at once, it is easy and normal to feel hopeless and overwhelmed at times. But our report offers a different perspective: it shows that change is already happening, and we can build on it. Across the globe, people are rethinking systems, restoring ecosystems and experimenting with bold, new ideas.

The journey towards a better future that we can build together starts with all of us. Even seemingly small actions matter, because collectively, they create a big impact. Readers should feel inspired to see themselves as part of this transformation, to reimagine what is possible and to work towards achieving it.

“The building is meant to be a model of how we can eliminate emissions from operating the building,” Kevin Emerson, director of building efficiency and decarbonization at Utah Clean Energy said on Friday.

A lot of the center’s energy efficiency comes from its insulation, as well, with contractors paying special attention to a correct airtight construction, Emerson said.
“One of the goals that Utah Clean Energy has is to help all the folks involved in construction across the state realize that building zero emissions as a standard practice is possible,” Emerson added.","When they’re out of the office, the Utah Clean Energy staff is often found in energy hearings, discussing policy with Utah leaders and advocating for more sustainable solutions to power the state. At their headquarters, on a small scale, they show how it’s done.

With the Climate Innovation Center, inaugurated in Salt Lake City last summer, the nonprofit not only searched for a facility that reflected its decarbonization efforts, but one that would create “a teaching tool and living laboratory,” inviting Utahns to watch the workings of a real-life, ultra-efficient, zero-emissions building.

After receiving many industry professionals to showcase the two-story building, with its extensive solar panels and a room with a battery to make intermittent energy available day and night, the organization opened its doors for the first time to the public for an open house on Friday.

“The building is meant to be a model of how we can eliminate emissions from operating the building,” Kevin Emerson, director of building efficiency and decarbonization at Utah Clean Energy said on Friday. “So there’s zero emissions that come from running the building. It’s all electric and all solar powered.”

Not only does the center produce enough energy to power its operations and even electric vehicles in its parking lot with about 39 kilowatts of solar capacity, but it has the ability to help utilities optimize their operations with a 90 kilowatt hours capacity battery.

That battery, sitting in a small room alongside a heat pump water heater, is part of Rocky Mountain Power’s Wattsmart batteries program, which pays users to incorporate their energy storage into the utility’s smart power grid.

“We think it’s important for our building to be kind of a flexible, interactive, kind of extension of the grid,” Emerson said. “And because ultimately, we want that to be a standard practice, where batteries are located across the electric grid to incorporate more effectively all the renewable energy that you will keep adding.”

Additionally, there’s no gas combustion in the premises. All water features use conservation systems and even the washer and dryer machine installed in the janitor’s closet uses a heat pump.

Outside, the small garden in the facade is highly drought tolerant, full of native and pollinator-friendly plants, as well.

Buildings play a big role in carbon emissions, Emerson told the group of climate and technology enthusiasts who showed up for the tour. According to the environmental nonprofit Architecture 2030, about 40% of carbon emissions come from built environments, either from its operations, or the pollution brought by construction activity itself, including mining, extraction, transportation and manufacturing materials.

That’s why, Emerson said, during the construction process, the team meticulously chose materials with smaller carbon footprints — from the carpets to the countertops and tiles.

Embarking in this project saved emissions by opting to preserve many of the features of the building that sat in the lot prior to the nonprofit’s arrival — and also, the staff repurposed wood pieces from the organization’s previous headquarters for this building.

A lot of the center’s energy efficiency comes from its insulation, as well, with contractors paying special attention to a correct airtight construction, Emerson said. Another team also supervised the space’s variable refrigerant flow heat pump, essentially a mechanical system that works like a large air conditioning unit that can provide cooling when it’s warm, and work in reverse to extract warmth out of the air, even on cold winter days.

The organization’s next step is to document all of these features by pursuing third-party certifications for the building, including a zero energy validation, focusing on the emissions it is not producing, and a zero carbon one to certify the materials used in retrofitting the space.

All of those lessons learned while designing and executing the building were included into climateinnovationcenter.org, a website, so others can incorporate non-polluting practices in new constructions or renovations.

“One of the goals that Utah Clean Energy has is to help all the folks involved in construction across the state realize that building zero emissions as a standard practice is possible,” Emerson added. “And that’s our vision, is that zero emission buildings become a standard practice here in Utah that supports energy affordability.”

Hopefully, he said, more buildings become a big part of solutions for climate and better air quality days in Utah.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-47642/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/053025_utah-clean-energy_08-1024x6831748866037.jpg?h=199d8c1f&itok=IYH2n_8l,N,,2025-06-02 10:03:29.424335

The Biden years saw the sharpest increase in U.S. investment in clean energy and clean transportation in the country’s history, creating the potential for sizable future progress toward reducing climate-warming emissions and creating tens of thousands of new jobs in the process.

The good news is that 2025’s first quarter saw solid growth in that space, up 6.9% from a year ago to $67.3 billion, according to data compiled by the Rhodium Group and MIT's Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research. The bad news is it’s probably the year’s high-water mark. That’s because the budget bill making its way through Congress, if passed in its current form, eviscerates federal support for renewable energy, electric vehicle tax credits and EV charging infrastructure–and all the jobs they’ve created.

Though the quarterly figure rose year over year, it was down 3.8% from the final quarter of 2024, according to the study’s authors. Still, clean investment activity accounted for just under 5% of overall private investment in structures, equipment, and durable consumer goods in the first quarter. Most of the gains in the quarter came from consumer spending on things like heat pumps and electric cars. In fact, it would have been stronger had it not been for Tesla’s 9% sales drop in the period, even as overall electric vehicles posted an 11% sales gain.

However, there was a notable drop in new investments in utility-scale clean power and industrial decarbonization tech, which fell 7.7% from a year ago. New utility-scale solar and battery power projects remained relatively stable, but new industrial decarbonization projects plunged to $79 million in the quarter from $16 billion a year earlier. Additionally, six clean technology manufacturing projects worth about $7 billion were canceled in the first quarter.

The controversial “One Big Beautiful Bill” passed the House by a single vote. If it’s not significantly revised in the Senate, the outlook for expanding clean energy gets pretty ugly as the year unfolds.

Forbes Sustainability Leaders 2025: Nominations Are Open

Deadline for nominations is 9:00am ET on Friday, June 13, 2025.

The Big Read

Meet The Net Zero Leaders 2025

Achieving net zero, or the reduction or off-setting of greenhouse gasses to as close to zero as possible, by 2050 will cost nearly $300 trillion (about 7.5 percent of global GDP annually, on average), according to research by the consulting firm McKinsey & Co. Not achieving it, though, could cost double that, according to global reinsurance company Swiss Re.

“If we understood that alternative more, the benefits of climate leadership would be more clear, and the markets would be pricing in these risks and these opportunities,” says Vit Henisz, vice dean of the ESG Initiative at The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. Not addressing emissions, Henisz says, would incur costs “bigger than the great financial crisis, bigger than the housing crisis, bigger than the dot-com crisis.”

To identify which companies have performed best in reducing or offsetting their greenhouse gas emissions, Forbes partnered with data providers Sustainalytics and Morningstar to create the third annual Net Zero Leaders list. Roughly 15,000 companies were evaluated for their efforts to achieve their net-zero targets within three ways in which a company can affect greenhouse gasses: emissions within the company’s direct control, such as using energy to manufacture a product (known as Scope 1); emissions from purchased energy (Scope 2); and lastly, supply-chain emissions as well as emissions released from consumer use of the company’s product (Scope 3). Firms are also assessed on how much of the emissions are managed by the company, their organizational preparedness, governance and financial strength to withstand challenges.

At the top of this year’s ranking are three electronic vehicle (EV) companies: Lucid Group at No. 1, followed by Rivian and Tesla. (Lucid and Rivian jumped to the top of the list after not even appearing on it last year.) The reason for EVs’ dominance is strong Scope 3 emissions performance, says Alex Osborne-Saponja, Sustainalytics’ director of ESG methodology and climate solutions. “Essentially, their product use is close to zero, and we only expect that to continue as they invest in the manufacture of electric vehicles.”

Hot Topic

Peter Davidson, CEO of Aligned Climate Capital, on the budget bill’s potential impact on renewable energy

What’s your take on how the clean energy space will fare if the budget bill passes with its current language that eliminates federal incentives for solar power?

This is a big topic of discussion all around. It’s really kind of two, two prongs. I think the first is there’s a full-on hardcore press with the Senate to get them to do something that’s more rational. The good news is Trump has said he wants to sign something by July 4, and the debt ceiling hits in August. So this whole thing is going to be resolved before then. It’s really just kind of madness for the next month or two, and then we should have some form of resolution.

We’ve been talking throughout [the process] with Republicans in the House, and they’ve all said that where it ended up is kind of crazy. But they all voted for it.

I think the conventional wisdom, which I am choosing to agree with, is that the House just punted on the issue. They felt the pressure just to get something out, kick it over to the Senate, and now they know the Senate is going to come back with a bunch of issues

that are different–and more kind of favorable to the IRA. Then the real reconciliation process is going to have to happen. So all that groundwork is what everybody’s doing now.

I’m going to DC to lobby a few senators, bringing some of the portfolio companies we’ve invested in. We’re putting a lot of money into Pennsylvania, so we’re bringing one of our CEOs from the Pennsylvania solar farms we’re developing, hoping to meet Senator McCormick and his staff. We’ve invested in a geothermal company in Texas, XGS, and we’re bringing the CEO of that company. Hopefully, we’re going to meet with one or two of the Republican senators.

That lobbying is going on everywhere. We hope everyone feels we get some positive movement.

The overwhelming amount of IRA spending for factories and everything is going into red districts, so there’s just the basic economic self-interest of Republicans in those districts. … You have to believe people who believe in rational economic policy, trade policy, tax policy, would somehow come out. They’ve been awfully quiet so far. But all the discussions we’ve had, and we’re talking to senior Republicans in leadership, they all get it.

If the bill were to pass in its current form, I think the answer I’d want to give, which is actually what I believe, is it would just slow down what’s happening. It doesn’t get in the way of any trends, because 90% of everything built last year was wind, solar and battery in the United States. Everything that was built globally was wind, solar and battery. … Why solar and wind coupled with batteries? It’s cheaper, it’s cleaner, and it’s faster to deploy. That’s why there’s so much distributed solar going on, which we’re very focused on. That’s not going to change.

Solar is cheaper than gas now on an unsubsidized basis. If all the tax credits are gone, it totally screws up the industry, because you’ve got guys who are developing projects based on a 30% or 40% [Investment Tax Credit]. A lot of those deals would just are no longer financeable because of what people are going to pay for the assets. So a lot of deals will die.

Do startups die if all federal incentives for clean energy go away?

It's certainly not good for anything that's dependent on the incentives to get down the cost curve.

I was at the Department of Energy when we were having to finance, the government was having to give loans, for utility-scale wind and solar projects because they were out of the money. It cost 20 cents to produce it. For the first offshore wind, the offtake agreement was 25 cents a kilowatt hour. It was too expensive to compete in the marketplace, and they were untried technologies, so people had to get comfortable, but it was too expensive.

Wind and solar are now the cheapest, so they're fine. What needs that help are things like nuclear power certainly, and that's kind of under threat too, although they're trying to figure out how to keep some money going for that. But geothermal, hydrogen, nuclear, all those are out of the money and they're the ones that need the tax incentives to get down below the cost curves. So they're the ones that are going to suffer, those technologies.

Carmakers and vehicle parts suppliers have welcomed a congressional move to revoke California’s authority to enforce stricter vehicle emissions standards, marking a major victory for industry groups that have long pushed back against the state’s transition towards electric vehicles.

The Senate’s May 22 vote mirrors efforts by President Donald Trump to undercut progressive states’ regulatory powers, and escalates the ongoing federal state clash over climate policy.

The measure will head to the president’s desk, with a signature expected, given Trump’s past efforts to limit what he views as state over-reach on climate policy — though it is not clear exactly when this will happen.

Although the Joe Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act provided generous consumer tax incentives for EV purchases, the transition has been considerably slower in the US than in Europe and China. Around 1.3mn units were sold in 2024 in the US, giving EVs an 8 per cent market share. In the EU, around 3mn units were sold.

Republican efforts to rescind these credits will raise costs, slow the transition to cleaner transport even further, and keep up to 40mn more petrol-only cars on the road by 2035, say analysts.

Among those facing repeal is California’s Advanced Clean Cars II rule, which mandates that 35 per cent of new car sales in the state be zero-emission or plug-in hybrids starting from 2026, moving to a full statewide ban on the sale of diesel and petrol-only cars by 2035.

Also on the chopping block are state laws requiring manufacturers to boost annual sales of zero-emission trucks and setting tighter emissions limits for new diesel truck models.

The laws are authorised through waivers granted to California under the 1967 Clean Air Act that allow the state to set vehicle emissions standards that go beyond federal requirements due to its chronic struggles with air pollution.

Conservative lawyers and politicians have long criticised the waivers, arguing they restrict consumer choice and act as a de facto nationwide EV mandate. The rule phasing out the sale of new petrol-only cars, which had also been adopted by 11 other states and Washington, DC, has drawn particularly strong opposition.

“This is not just a California problem, it is a nationwide assault on gas-powered cars,” Republican Wyoming Senator John Barrasso said in a statement, warning the ban would affect nearly 40 per cent of the US car market.

The global adoption of EVs is very nearly a question of life or death for the oil industry, and they’re responding accordingly, joining their political allies to launch a full-scale attack on EV manufacturing and consumer choice in the US

Trevor Higgins, Center for American Progress

On the same day as the Senate’s vote, the House of Representatives passed President Trump’s sweeping tax package, which calls for the cancellation of a number of consumer tax credits for zero-emission vehicles — cost-saving measures intended to help middle and low-income households switch to EVs.

The removal of tax credits would prevent roughly one-third of US households from changing to EVs, says research and advocacy organisation the Center for American Progress.

“The global adoption of EVs is very nearly a question of life or death for the oil industry, and they’re responding accordingly, joining their political allies to launch a full-scale attack on EV manufacturing and consumer choice in the US,” CAP vice-president for energy and environment Trevor Higgins tells Sustainable Views.

California governor Gavin Newsom and attorney-general Rob Bonta have pledged to challenge the vote in court, with Newsom describing the move as “illegal” and “unconstitutional”.

But it is unclear whether any legal challenges will succeed, given different interpretations of the Congressional Review Act, the law invoked by senators to roll back the waivers.

Industry backs repeal

Perhaps unsurprisingly, the move has drawn broad support from the car industry, which has generally been slow to begin producing EVs.

“These EV sales mandates were never achievable,” said Alliance for Automotive Innovation chief executive John Bozzella in a statement. “There’s a significant gap between the marketplace and these EV sales requirements.”

Zero-emission vehicles accounted for around 25 per cent of new car sales in California in 2024. Recent data from the California Energy Commission shows the industry’s growth to be stalling, with the state’s EV market share dipping slightly in the first quarter of 2025.

The commission notes this dip was driven by a 21.5 per cent drop in new Tesla registrations, with non-Tesla registrations growing by 14 per cent.

The Speciality Equipment Market Association, a trade group representing the vehicle parts industry, has also praised the Senate vote to repeal California’s waivers, framing it as a necessary check on the state’s influence over national car policy.

“Automakers would either sell fewer cars to meet California’s requirements, or withdraw from the ACC II states — either way consumers lose, and roughly 30 per cent of the automotive after-market industry was marked for death because of a single state’s government action,” says Sema senior vice-president for public and government affairs Karen Bailey-Chapman.

She argues a “technology-neutral government” is necessary to support innovation and ingenuity in the nation’s automotive industry.

“By eliminating mandates, Congress preserved Americans’ rights to vehicle choice and place their faith in the automotive after-market industry’s ability to design, manufacture and bring to market products that help solve the emissions challenge,” says Bailey-Chapman.

Other car trade associations and manufacturers contacted by Sustainable Views declined to comment.

State-level climate action to persist

While the federal rollbacks will undermine regulatory certainty for climate action at the state level, University of California law professor Ann Carlson says: “States have significant powers to regulate emissions that are not subject to federal limitation.”

She highlights policies including California’s cap-and-trade programme and Low Carbon Fuel Standard as key tools for supporting the state’s transition to EVs.

The lack of federal action will further empower states to determine pathways to protect their residents from the impact of not only climate change, but also poor air quality and high transportation fuelling costs that are impacting drivers’ wallets

Kathy Harris, Natural Resources Defense Council

While Trump has expressed interest in targeting these policies too, lawyers say his efforts to undermine state powers is unconstitutional and unlikely to succeed when challenged in court. The constitution dictates that the president’s remit is largely limited to federal law.

Zachary Pilchen, environmental and regulatory attorney at law firm Holland & Knight, adds that rather than halting climate action altogether, Democrat-led states are likely to pivot to less direct strategies for cutting vehicle emissions, such as regulating traffic-generating facilities like warehouses and ports through requirements that avoid the need for Clean Air Act waivers, or expanding state-level incentives for zero-emission vehicles.

Following the Senate vote, the US Climate Alliance, a group of 24 governors committed to climate action, launched its Affordable Clean Cars Coalition — an initiative made up of 11 states that aims to make cleaner vehicles more affordable and accessible across the country.

“The lack of federal action — or in this case, active attacks on climate change policies — will further empower states to determine pathways to protect their residents from the impact of not only climate change, but also poor air quality and high transportation fuelling costs that are impacting drivers’ wallets,” says Kathy Harris, director of clean vehicles at the Natural Resources Defense Council.",https://d2iztrg3kgqpue.cloudfront.net/production/0916890b-0de9-410b-8b3a-28d2208edd66.jpg,N,,2025-06-02 09:09:54.852747

“The building is meant to be a model of how we can eliminate emissions from operating the building,” Kevin Emerson, director of building efficiency and decarbonization at Utah Clean Energy said on Friday.
Buildings play a big role in carbon emissions, Emerson told the group of climate and technology enthusiasts who showed up for the tour.
A lot of the center’s energy efficiency comes from its insulation, as well, with contractors paying special attention to a correct airtight construction, Emerson said.
“One of the goals that Utah Clean Energy has is to help all the folks involved in construction across the state realize that building zero emissions as a standard practice is possible,” Emerson added.","When they’re out of the office, the Utah Clean Energy staff is often found in energy hearings, discussing policy with Utah leaders and advocating for more sustainable solutions to power the state. At their headquarters, on a small scale, they show how it’s done.

With the Climate Innovation Center, inaugurated in Salt Lake City last summer, the nonprofit not only searched for a facility that reflected its decarbonization efforts, but one that would create “a teaching tool and living laboratory,” inviting Utahns to watch the workings of a real-life, ultra-efficient, zero-emissions building.

After receiving many industry professionals to showcase the two-story building, with its extensive solar panels and a room with a battery to make intermittent energy available day and night, the organization opened its doors for the first time to the public for an open house on Friday.

“The building is meant to be a model of how we can eliminate emissions from operating the building,” Kevin Emerson, director of building efficiency and decarbonization at Utah Clean Energy said on Friday. “So there’s zero emissions that come from running the building. It’s all electric and all solar powered.”

Not only does the center produce enough energy to power its operations and even electric vehicles in its parking lot with about 39 kilowatts of solar capacity, but it has the ability to help utilities optimize their operations with a 90 kilowatt hours capacity battery.

That battery, sitting in a small room alongside a heat pump water heater, is part of Rocky Mountain Power’s Wattsmart batteries program, which pays users to incorporate their energy storage into the utility’s smart power grid.

“We think it’s important for our building to be kind of a flexible, interactive, kind of extension of the grid,” Emerson said. “And because ultimately, we want that to be a standard practice, where batteries are located across the electric grid to incorporate more effectively all the renewable energy that you will keep adding.”

Additionally, there’s no gas combustion in the premises. All water features use conservation systems and even the washer and dryer machine installed in the janitor’s closet uses a heat pump.

Outside, the small garden in the facade is highly drought tolerant, full of native and pollinator-friendly plants, as well.

Buildings play a big role in carbon emissions, Emerson told the group of climate and technology enthusiasts who showed up for the tour. According to the environmental nonprofit Architecture 2030, about 40% of carbon emissions come from built environments, either from its operations, or the pollution brought by construction activity itself, including mining, extraction, transportation and manufacturing materials.

That’s why, Emerson said, during the construction process, the team meticulously chose materials with smaller carbon footprints — from the carpets to the countertops and tiles.

Embarking in this project saved emissions by opting to preserve many of the features of the building that sat in the lot prior to the nonprofit’s arrival — and also, the staff repurposed wood pieces from the organization’s previous headquarters for this building.

A lot of the center’s energy efficiency comes from its insulation, as well, with contractors paying special attention to a correct airtight construction, Emerson said. Another team also supervised the space’s variable refrigerant flow heat pump, essentially a mechanical system that works like a large air conditioning unit that can provide cooling when it’s warm, and work in reverse to extract warmth out of the air, even on cold winter days.

The organization’s next step is to document all of these features by pursuing third-party certifications for the building, including a zero energy validation, focusing on the emissions it is not producing, and a zero carbon one to certify the materials used in retrofitting the space.

All of those lessons learned while designing and executing the building were included into climateinnovationcenter.org, a website, so others can incorporate non-polluting practices in new constructions or renovations.

“One of the goals that Utah Clean Energy has is to help all the folks involved in construction across the state realize that building zero emissions as a standard practice is possible,” Emerson added. “And that’s our vision, is that zero emission buildings become a standard practice here in Utah that supports energy affordability.”

Hopefully, he said, more buildings become a big part of solutions for climate and better air quality days in Utah.",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/053025_Utah-Clean-Energy_08-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2025-06-02 09:11:19.015271

Congress was on vacation last week, but both chambers are back by Tuesday, and with their return comes another two weeks of discussion on the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. The House passed the bill before leaving for a Memorial Day recess, and now it’s before the Senate for approval.

I’ve already told you about proposed cuts to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and a raised tax on private colleges and universities.

Sen. Thom Tillis has been open that he does not support portions of the current version. He’s been most vocal about cuts to clean energy tax credits. The current version of the bill deters clean energy producers from working with China, limits and then ends tax credits on wind and solar projects and quickly eliminates tax credits for electric vehicles.

“Sen. Tillis wants to make sure nothing in the bill impedes jobs or growth,” said Daniel Keylin, Tillis’ senior adviser. “It’s not necessarily about keeping those credits, but it’s about providing those businesses with a soft landing.”

Sen. Ted Budd, a Republican from Davie County, hasn’t spoken publicly about the bill, and doesn’t often push back on Republican legislation.

The Hill reported Budd was among senators who met with Senate Majority Leader John Thune and Senate Finance Committee Chairman Mike Crapo about Medicaid cuts and what they would mean for rural communities.

President Trump asked the Senate to get the bill passed as soon as possible.

The Senate wants to finish work on the bill before its Fourth of July recess begins on June 28. That would leave the House an additional 12 days to review any changes the Senate made before lawmakers begin their monthlong annual August recess, which starts July 25.

The budget bill eliminates nearly $1 billion in clean energy and transportation investments approved by Congress in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.
Seventy-four new clean energy and transportation facilities have begun development, and 43 have begun manufacturing American-made products, according to an analysis by Energy Innovation Policy & Technology, a non-partisan energy and climate policy think tank.
“The federal government is trying to make the transition to clean energy harder and slower,” he said.
The budget bill, as written, jeopardizes that work in multiple ways, said Cameron Dales, Peak Energy’s co-founder.","Layoffs could be coming to Namaste Solar, a Colorado-based company that installs solar panels on homes and businesses, if the Republicans’ federal budget bill is made law in its current form.

That’s because the legislation would cut off millions of dollars of funding for clean energy projects, including taxpayer credits for installing solar panels on houses. And that would almost sink Namaste’s business in Denver and Boulder.

“They don’t want any residential solar after December of this year,” Jason Sharpe, Namaste’s chief executive officer, said of the bill, which is supported by President Donald Trump. “Sixty-five percent of the jobs in the solar industry come from the residential market, and so what we’re looking at is the lack of a residential market of any kind, leasing or direct-to-consumer, and that means significant layoffs for our business.”

While the Republican budget bill, which narrowly passed the House of Representatives on May 22, has received much attention for drastic cuts to Medicaid and SNAP benefits that would fund tax breaks, it also rolls back tax credits and low-interest loans for a wide variety of clean energy projects.

The bill’s budget cuts would repeal or quickly phase out whole categories of tax credits and loans for things such as home improvements for consumers, electric vehicles, wind and solar energy production, hydrogen energy, nuclear energy and carbon capture.

Executives who lead Colorado energy companies, both big and small, said eliminating tax credits will decimate the progress made in recent years in the United States as the country seeks as many sources of energy as possible to supply growing demand. It could also lead to higher electricity bills for consumers and eliminate jobs, sending more jobs to China and other Asian markets where production is cheaper and more advanced.

“I don’t look at what we do as green or blue or red,” said Jon Chase, vice president of government relations for Vestas, a company that makes turbines and other parts for windmills in Windsor and Brighton. “An electron doesn’t have a color. We need all of it to meet the demand that we have.”

Environmentalists are also warning that the cuts would be detrimental to Colorado’s goals of eliminating 100% of greenhouse gas emissions in the state by 2050 because it would increase a reliance on fossil fuels to power the grid and fuel all the cars and trucks on the road. They also warn that the cuts would threaten Colorado’s waterways because of the toxic chemicals that are released by burning them.

“It’s leading to dirtier air and dirtier water — things no one voted for,” said Patrick Drupp, the Sierra Club‘s director of climate policy.

The budget bill eliminates nearly $1 billion in clean energy and transportation investments approved by Congress in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.

In the almost three years since the act was passed, 3,800 new jobs have been announced in Colorado, along with nearly $362 million in investments from federal grants and loans. Seventy-four new clean energy and transportation facilities have begun development, and 43 have begun manufacturing American-made products, according to an analysis by Energy Innovation Policy & Technology, a non-partisan energy and climate policy think tank.

Battle brewing over bill

Colorado’s House delegation voted along party lines. Now it goes to the Senate, where the Republican majority leadership hopes to hold a final vote before July 4.

A political battle is expected, and Colorado’s representatives and senators spent the last week meeting with constituents to make their pitch on whether or not it should be approved.

Rep. Gabe Evans, a Republican representing the 8th Congressional District, held a news conference at the state Capitol to praise the bill he voted for, saying it “delivers the resources to protect our country, to protect our border, to get violent criminals out of our community.”

But U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colorado, warned that “the stakes are really, really high for Colorado.”

Bennet met last week with executives from 10 Colorado companies to discuss the budget cuts. The tax credits were “doing the job that they were supposed to do and doing that, I think, very, very well in Colorado. Now we’re at risk of them being basically completely ripped away and dismantled.”

Will Toor, executive director of the Colorado Energy Office, which promotes clean energy programs in the state, said the bill would drive up the cost of electricity in Colorado, force people to pay more for cars and trucks, and reduce the amount of money people can receive through tax credits to improve the energy efficiency of their homes.

Colorado started its path toward reducing greenhouse gas emissions during the first Trump administration, and then the Biden-era plans for boosting alternative energies gave the state more momentum, Toor said. He said the state can still reach its climate goals, but it will have to work harder to do so.

“The federal government is trying to make the transition to clean energy harder and slower,” he said.

Uncertainty cripples planning

Robert Kenney, president of Xcel Energy’s Colorado operations, said the repeal of the Inflation Reduction Act would not stop his company from moving away from coal. But Xcel would be forced to push the expense of moving to renewable sources onto customers as the company tries to keep up with a growing demand for electricity.

“These projects are made, I won’t say made possible, but they’re made more affordable for our customers by virtue of production and investment tax credits,” Kenney said. “And I like to emphasize the fact that what this means is that our customers are able to achieve our collective climate goals at the lowest possible cost, and the loss of production and investment tax credits would increase the cost of these projects for our customers.”

He also said the budget bill is injecting instability and uncertainty into the construction industry, and Xcel plans its major construction projects as far out as 10 years.

“That makes it impossible to be able to plan in any kind of meaningful way,” he said.

Peak Energy, a sodium-ion battery systems manufacturer, runs a research and development center in Broomfield where scientists and engineers are working to develop technology that can be built and used in the United States. The batteries, which are bigger than an SUV, are used to store the electricity generated by solar or wind so that there is a power supply when the sun sets or the wind stills.

The budget bill, as written, jeopardizes that work in multiple ways, said Cameron Dales, Peak Energy’s co-founder.

Twenty years ago, no large-scale batteries were made in the U.S. Now, a handful of companies are building them here, but they are foreign-owned, Dale said.

“Our mission is to be the first American-owned, American-made battery company in the United States,” Dales said. “And the IRA started that process and has been incredibly successful in actually catalyzing investments in those factories.”

Peak Energy is planning to build a $1.5 billion, 1,500-employee factory to build the batteries in the U.S., with four Wall Street investment firms reviewing the proposal even as the budget bill winds its way through Congress, he said. The bill would penalize companies for buying those Chinese-made parts, which would lead them to keep their manufacturing facilities offshore to avoid those extra financial costs.

“I can tell you, if it passes the way it is today, I will cancel the project,” Dales said.

‘Kneecap our progress’

As for Colorado’s plans to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions, the tax bill would “kneecap our progress,” said Katie Belgard, a Conservation Colorado vice president.

All of the renewable energy plans help Colorado reduce the amount of greenhouse gases — carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and other chemicals — that trap heat in the atmosphere. That increased heat raises global temperatures and creates climate change, which leads to more drought, more intense wildfires and extreme weather.

Increasing the supply of renewable energy also helps reduce ozone pollution — a problem that plagues the Front Range during the summer when nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds bake in the sun and create a brown smog.

“It is the most anti-environmental bill we’ve seen in the history of the country,” she said. “This has been a giveaway for polluters and the fossil fuel industry here in Colorado.”",https://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/161184624.jpg?w=1024&h=681,N,,2025-06-02 09:10:07.929283

For example, there was a clean energy performance standard that would have required utilities across the country to get to 80% clean energy by 2030.
And I wish more of those people could get back in the political world.” Climate wasn’t the focus Most messaging about the IRA focused on economic benefits, rather than climate.
The biggest hurdle in marketing something like the IRA or another climate policy isn’t the exact message, Marshall says.","When Dustin Mulvaney teaches a class in environmental law at a California university, he always asks a simple question: Who’s heard of the Inflation Reduction Act? Over the last three years, he says, only around 10 students out of hundreds have raised their hands.

His students aren’t alone. When the IRA passed in 2022, it was the largest climate investment in American history. But while climate nerds may know the law well, most people know little about what it includes. In one survey last year, only 10% of Americans who said climate change was a “very important” issue to them had heard much about what the Biden administration had done to try to tackle it. Another survey found that around a quarter of voters had never heard of the IRA at all.

“I consider myself to be a highly engaged voter,” says Britton Taylor, a brand strategist with more than two decades of experience working with big brands. “I take in tons of political media. And whatever Democrats did to message this or talk about climate, even I didn’t see it. Or if they did do stuff, nothing resonated with me.”

The law’s climate ideas are broadly popular—most people support extended tax credits for electric cars, incentives for American solar panel factories, and a slew of other programs designed to slash U.S. emissions 40% by 2030. Most Americans are also worried about climate change and how it’s affecting their lives, from extreme weather to home insurance rates. But the IRA was a marketing failure. Now it’s on the chopping block, as the Senate considers a bill that would eliminate or phase out almost all of it—despite the fact that it has benefitted red states and districts the most.

The problems started with the name

The bill was originally called “Build Back Better”—not a particularly creative name, since it had been used multiple times in the past after disasters like Hurricane Sandy. But it captured the basic idea: as the country recovered from the pandemic, the right policies could help the economy recover while also cutting pollution and improving workers’ rights.

Then came Joe Manchin, the West Virginia senator whose vote was necessary for the bill to pass. Manchin wanted a name focused on inflation. “The audience we were marketing to was a single man,” says Holly Burke, vice president of communications for the nonprofit Evergreen Action. The bill was renamed the Inflation Reduction Act.

Critics said the name was misleading. Manchin was right that voters cared about inflation, but the bill hadn’t been designed to directly address it. Models from the Congressional Budget Office and Penn Wharton projected that it would have little short-term impact on inflation. And while it would help reduce the price of energy and could help with inflation over time, the name didn’t really reflect what the bill was about.

It also set up the wrong conversation, some critics say. “The Inflation Reduction Act was, as a name, possibly one of the silliest self-owns I can recall,” says Anat Shenker-Osorio, a progressive strategist who does public opinion research and message testing. “It basically forced Democratic politicians to run around for an entire cycle saying ‘inflation, inflation, inflation.’ The point was inflation reduction. But people don’t listen to details, and you’re literally saying the word inflation over and over again, thereby reminding them of their pain point.”

Inflation did decrease, largely driven by other factors like Federal Reserve interest rate hikes, and the easing of pandemic-related supply chain disruption. But people couldn’t see those impacts in their own lives. “Americans struggle with math, and many of them don’t understand inflation to be a rate of change,” says Shenker-Osorio. “So when they’re told inflation is reduced and prices are not reduced, they say, ‘I don’t know what you’re talking about. I go to the grocery store every week. There’s no inflation reduction.’ So, there’s a disconnect.”

Voters tend to trust Republicans more on economic issues, whether or not that’s justified. So Democrats may have been better served by framing the bill around something other than the economy, Shenker-Osorio says.

“If, for illustration, they had named this the ‘God Bless America’ bill or ‘We Love America Act,’ suddenly we’re having a conversation about what does it mean to love America, to do right by America? That allows you to talk about things like ensuring we have clean, renewable energy and that the places you loved to go with your grandparents as a kid will be the places you take your grandkids in the future. What you have to do is figure out, what is my brand advantage? What is the conversation where voters trust me most, regard me most highly?”

It also didn’t help that the acronym “IRA” already had multiple associations, including retirement accounts and the Irish Republican Army. “When the bill first passed, I Googled something about it, and all I got was information about the ‘Troubles’ in Ireland,” says Burke. “I was like, I could have seen that coming.” (And while laws often don’t have catchy names, “IRA” is particularly dull.)

Other laws have been rebranded after passing. The Affordable Care Act, for example, became widely known as Obamacare. (The name was initially used pejoratively, though the Obama administration eventually embraced it.) But no one attempted to find a different way to talk about the IRA.

The complexity didn’t help

The law, at 273 pages long, isn’t easy to concisely describe. There are at least 21 different tax provisions for clean energy alone, for example. It also goes beyond energy and climate to include things like lowering the cost of medicine.

Some of the programs also take time to roll out, making the direct benefits to voters harder to communicate. The tax credits for consumers were also somewhat hard to market—you probably don’t think about getting a discount on an efficient water heater until your current water heater breaks. And if you do eventually buy an appliance and get a tax credit, you might not realize where it came from. It also might not be obvious that a particular factory opened in your town because of the law.

“You have to connect a lot of dots to get from we passed this tax incentive, that had this additional bonus credit that incentivized companies to invest in your community, and create that job,” Burke says. “That’s a lot of leaps to make for an average voter who does not care about tax credits.”

There’s a lesson, she argues, for different policy design. “That’s not to say that we shouldn’t do abstract, wonky policies that make real impacts on people’s lives,” she says. “But if you want to have a politically durable victory, I think making sure that you’re incorporating things that are really understandable to the general public, and there’s a clear line from point A to point B: the government did this thing, and here’s how it supported my community.”

Some programs like this were in the original bill but eliminated, she says. For example, there was a clean energy performance standard that would have required utilities across the country to get to 80% clean energy by 2030. That’s “a more clear cut and intuitive way to understand how the Biden admin was delivering on climate than something with a fuzzier impact like ‘hundreds of billions in investments into clean energy,'” she says. “Both of those policies are good, to be clear, but saying we’re getting our entire grid to 80% clean electricity is a more immediately understandable impact.”

Boring stats don’t sell ideas

The Biden administration and supporters often focused on abstract statistics, like the fact that the IRA could create or support more than a million jobs nationwide. Those types of messages don’t really land. “The more conceptual and distant it is, the worse it does,” says John Marshall, a marketing executive who left the corporate world to launch Potential Energy Coalition, a nonprofit focused on climate. “The more local and human it is, the better it does.”

advertisement

Creativity was also often missing in the messaging, which was typically driven by political consultants rather than creatives. “I thought about this a lot as someone who works in the more traditional advertising and branding world, as opposed to someone who’s anchored in the political space,” says Taylor, the brand strategist. “I feel like Democrats have fallen into a rut in terms of the way that they message . . . Like, ‘we have to explain stuff to people.’ It’s just boring and it does not resonate with people, especially young people.”

Being boring comes at a steep cost, as marketing studies have proven. “When you’re dull, it’s both ineffective and expensive,” Taylor says. “In the political context, being dull is extremely perilous for the Democrats, if you think about what’s at stake in terms of our democracy and our republic. You end up having to spend a lot more in media dollars in order to achieve the same amount of effectiveness than you would have with more compelling campaigns.”

There are exceptions. Potential Energy Coalition, for example, ran an ad for clean school buses that features a grimy bus driver handing out cigarettes to children—not boring. But Taylor argues that the Democratic Party would do better if it worked with a wide swath of experienced marketers.

“There’s been this firewall between the creative community and the political community,” he says. “I really wish that firewall would come down, because I think there’s so many people in the world of advertising that would love to help. Every brief that I get from brands now is, how do you make a dent in culture? Or how do you get talked about? It’s all about generating fame for your brand like press, earned media. That’s what we’re good at, or at least the really talented people in advertising. And I wish more of those people could get back in the political world.”

Climate wasn’t the focus

Most messaging about the IRA focused on economic benefits, rather than climate. The economic benefits are significant, to be clear. The tax credits for consumers, for example, help pay for appliances that can slash energy bills. “I think part of the conversation that we collectively should be having right now is, what are the best ways to reduce energy costs for American families?” says Ari Matusiak, co-founder and CEO of the nonprofit Rewiring America. “An obvious way to do that is by people having more efficient machines in their homes that use less energy and deliver better performance. And that’s exactly what these tax credits are helping to pay for.”

Surveys showed that Americans were worried about daily costs. That’s obviously a very real concern. Still, that doesn’t mean that the dominant messaging should have necessarily been about inflation or the high cost of living, says Shenker-Osorio. “You have to decide what the conversation is going to be about,” she says.

Climate change ranks lower when people are forced to compare it with the economy. Still, Americans do care about climate impacts, and they respond to strong messages about it. “We’ve done hundreds and hundreds of tests on this,” says Marshall from Potential Energy Coalition. “There is a latent, easily [activated] concern in the minds of almost all citizens that something is wrong with the planet and that we should be addressing it. That is a concern that touches people of all political persuasions. And so when you message the fact that we need to stop that from happening, it is very motivating.”

The dire threat to the planet is really the main reason for people to support clean energy. “It’s a pretty major reason—it’s actually bigger than the other things,” Marshall says. “And so we are chickening out of our big ‘why.'”

As Potential Energy Coalition tests different messages, the most effective are about the direct consequences of climate change on people’s lives. “The messaging needs to move from morality to materiality,” he says. “It shouldn’t be something one does because of my particular values. It should be something that one gets behind because it materially affects their lives . . . how it’s affecting your life, your kids, your farm, your insurance costs.” In the group’s testing, the least effective messages were promises of economic benefit.

How much does marketing matter for policy?

Even if most Americans don’t know the details of what’s in the IRA, the incentives have been popular. “We’ve seen massive uptake of the various programs,” says Matusiak. Taxpayers claimed more than $8 billion in credits on their 2023 returns—more than twice what the government had projected. Millions of people have used a tool that Rewiring America created to help households calculate how much they could save through tax credits and rebates. Companies invested hundreds of billions in new factories to make electric cars, solar panels, and other clean energy tech (though billions in planned investments have now been cancelled since Trump changed the direction of federal policy). The majority of the investment in clean manufacturing went to red states, despite the fact that no Republican voted for the legislation.

If the IRA’s initiatives had stayed in place as long as they were intended to—10 years—it wouldn’t matter so much whether most people knew that they existed. If you found out about a tax credit through a contractor, or TurboTax, and didn’t know where it originated, you’d still be able to use it. But if voters still aren’t making the connection between the programs and how they benefit their own lives, they probably won’t feel motivated to advocate for them now that they’re under threat. And name recognition isn’t enough on its own—even Medicare is at risk in the current version of the budget bill. But arguably, better marketing could have helped.

The biggest hurdle in marketing something like the IRA or another climate policy isn’t the exact message, Marshall says. Even though some messages perform better than others, climate messaging in general resonates. But it’s harder to make sure that those messages are actually reaching voters. “The major challenge on climate legislation is a distribution challenge rather than a messaging challenge,” he says. “We don’t have nearly enough spokespeople, we don’t have nearly enough faces of the movement. We need a lot more people talking about it.”

Political will for climate action could easily grow. “We, the citizens, haven’t changed,” he says. “The government changed . . . but the regular people haven’t changed. They’re getting the same limited amount of information. They still care a lot about this issue, and they’re phenomenally moveable on the issue.”","https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024,h_1024/wp-cms-2/2025/05/p-1-91342814-ira-marketing-failure.jpg",N,,2025-06-02 09:10:17.522934

In May, Gov. Stein announced several businesses coming to North Carolina. In Charlotte, it was AVL Manufacturing, promising to build a new production facility resulting in 325 new jobs. In Holly Springs, it was biotechnology company Genentech, announcing plans to build a new manufacturing plant with 420 jobs. In Goldsboro, it was transformer manufacturer Prolec-GE Waukesha, also with a new manufacturing plant, and 330 jobs.

Those are just three of a slew of businesses coming to the state this year. So, it was no surprise that when Stein delivered a speech at the Emerging Issues Forum on energy at N.C. State University this week, the subject went beyond policy to talk about the economy and business.

In his speech at N.C. State on Wednesday, Stein said that while the state has more work ahead to reduce pollution and have a clean tech economy, “in many ways, the market demands that we do.”

“Nearly half of the leading companies in the world have a net zero emissions target. Many of these companies want to call North Carolina home. In fact, many of them already do: Amazon, Google, Meta, Toyota, Honeywell. When these companies decided where to invest, they were looking for a strong workforce, a favorable business environment, an excellent quality of life and places where they could get inexpensive, clean and reliable electricity,” Stein said.

Stein talked about another one of his economic development announcements, held in April in Greenville, when Boviet Solar opened a new solar module factory. “Boviet is a powerful addition to our supply chain that includes a roster of 220 solar companies that are helping to provide more low-carbon energy sources,” Commerce Secretary Lee Lilley said at the time.

“They have already hired 400 employees, nearly, and they’re going to keep hiring. If things progress as they fully expect, when they get to phase two, that number should increase to over 1,000 employees, making them one of the largest private sector employers in the county of Pitt,” Stein said in his energy speech this past week.

“We are a top 10 state in the nation in the number of clean energy jobs, more than 100,000 workers in the clean energy sector. Unfortunately, some in Congress want to slow our growth,” Stein said, referring to the gutting of clean energy tax credits in the huge U.S. House bill passed this month.

Talking to reporters after his speech, Stein said he’s told North Carolinian members of Congress about “the urgency that we keep those tax credits.” “Here’s the thing. Companies make investments based on policy, and there has to be certainty, there has to be settled expectations, or else they do not know how to invest,” he said.

“They were told that these credits existed. Many of them have made major business decisions about investing in North Carolina. We’ve got to preserve those credits so that the companies get the bargain that they struck.”

And speaking of taxes, I asked him about the current tax battle between the House and Senate budget plans, which you can read about in my recent story.

Siemens and Hirano Tecseed, a Japanese machine builder, are collaborating to improve battery manufacturing. The partnership aims to standardize and digitalize battery coating machines to enhance process efficiency, reduce material waste, and support consistent product quality and operator effectiveness.

The battery market is expanding alongside the global move toward sustainable energy, particularly with the rise of electric vehicles and large-scale energy storage. To meet demand, companies like Hirano aim to scale up production and reduce costs while maintaining quality and safety. One key step in battery manufacturing involves coating foil strips with multiple active layers to create electrodes. Defects during this stage can impact battery performance and durability, making careful control of speed and tension during coating essential.

A key component of the collaboration has been the development of a digital twin for battery manufacturing equipment. Using Siemens’ Simcenter software, Hirano successfully simulated and tested a digital twin of its battery coating machine. Drawing on real-time data from a Simatic controller and Sinamics drives, which automate the pilot machine, the simulation provides a highly accurate virtual model for performance testing. By leveraging Simcenter Amesim, a systems simulation software from the Siemens Xcelerator platform, Hirano’s design engineers can virtually assess and optimize the machine’s web handling system for maximum throughput.

In the past, parameters for Hirano’s machines were set based on experience, which could lead to defective products due to incorrect settings. Using Siemens’ comprehensive digital twin technology has enabled Hirano to configure and simulate a machine in a virtual environment before committing to physical production. This allows Hirano to significantly reduce the need for physical prototypes and predict potential product defects. Development engineers can evaluate and optimize machine settings five times faster in the virtual environment compared to physical operation. Additionally, up to 80 percent of the machine simulation and digital twin can be constructed using pre-configured, standard function blocks, resulting in shorter implementation and commissioning times, as well a reduction in development costs.",https://www.engineering.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Siemens-Hirano-Tecseed-partner-to-improve-battery-production.webp,N,,2025-06-02 11:25:49.071103

""This is not a great sign for Tesla,"" Electrek wrote.","When many people think of electric vehicles, they think of Tesla.

However, Tesla's brand image has taken some hits recently as CEO Elon Musk has been active in American and global politics, polarizing consumers, who have more options than ever to choose from on a robust EV market.

According to Yahoo Finance, the first three months of 2025 were Tesla's worst quarter since the second quarter of 2022. With dropping sales, Tesla has worked on incentivizing consumers to buy its cars.

The perks, detailed by Electrek, include discounts for a variety of customers, credit opportunities for Lyft drivers, and subsidized interest rates.

One commenter noted that the company is ""truly pulling all demand levers.""

""I am being contacted by Tesla representatives asking if I would like to come in and take a test drive so it appears Tesla Advisors are being asked/told to reach out to anyone who showed interest in Tesla in the past,"" they added. ""I will say Tesla has improved the quality of the Model 3/Y greatly and the service is very good in my area so it saddens me when I think the CEO has done so much hurt the hard working Tesla employees globally by his actions (with zero accountability).""

This all comes in the wake of Tesla benefiting as the sole exemption from a large automotive tariff, since it is the only automaker at this time that meets the required criteria.

Watch now: How bad is a gas stove for your home's indoor air quality?

Ultimately, EVs (regardless of brand) remain a great choice for someone interested in cutting down on fuel consumption. EVs are great choices for environmental purposes. The cars do not emit any pollutants while running and account for less overall pollution when considering other factors.

While some EV opponents note that mining the materials to create the batteries is bad for the environment, the mining processes are getting more efficient, and battery technology is advancing to last longer. It is also less polluting than harvesting dirty fuels.

There are also financial benefits to driving an EV. For one, you can save a lot of money charging your car compared to filling it with fuel at the pump. According to the Southwest Energy Efficiency Project, this could be around $1,000 per year.

You can further those savings (and slash potential charging pollution) by using solar to power your vehicle, and EnergySage's free tools can help you save up to $10,000 on installation. They allow you to compare quotes from vetted local installers to save the most money possible.

You can also still get tax credits from purchasing an EV through the Inflation Reduction Act. However, the Trump administration is considering eliminating these benefits. If you want to take advantage of the tax breaks, you may have to act soon.

While Tesla's sales are down in the United States, overall EV sales have been increasing. All in all, Electrek suggests the influx of incentives from the automaker has ominous undertones.

Courts should, instead, defer to federal agencies as much as is reasonable when reviewing a NEPA study.
When federal agencies write environmental studies under NEPA, courts should broadly defer to the decisions that they make.
“By comparison, nature based restorations have enormous apertures,” Chi told me.
And then they have to go fix it,” Chi told me.","It could reshape the scale of legal challenges that projects could face in the future, giving the Trump administration — and any successive administration — greater leeway to approve energy projects.

Under NEPA, federal agencies must study the environmental impacts of their decisions before they make them. The strictest studies can run into the hundreds of pages, and they can take years to complete.

But in what was essentially an 8-0 decision, the Court ruled that federal agencies almost never need to analyze the second-order environmental effects of their decisions. In other words, an agency need only study the environmental impact of a project itself — be it a pipeline, a solar farm, or, in the case at issue, a railroad — and not its metaphorically downstream consequences. That remains the case even if a given project might indirectly make it much easier to do something with a big environmental footprint, such as drilling for oil or natural gas.

That is the clearest effect of the ruling. But Justice Brett Kavanaugh, writing for the court’s conservative majority, went much further than that summary alone suggests. In a broad and forceful ruling, he told lower courts that they should stop nitpicking the environmental studies that federal agencies must publish under NEPA to justify their own decision-making. Courts should, instead, defer to federal agencies as much as is reasonable when reviewing a NEPA study. “The goal of the law,” he writes, “is to inform agency decision-making, not to paralyze it.” (Justice Neil Gorsuch recused himself from the case because of his connection to an oil magnate who could have benefited from the ruling.)

That suggests a significant change is coming to how the court system interprets NEPA, a law that is little known to the general public but that plays a defining role in how federal agencies make decisions or approve infrastructure projects. NEPA creates a procedural requirement that federal agencies study the environmental impact of any “major decision,” but that category is so broad that it affects virtually everything the federal government does — spend money, write a new regulation, or approve a new project on federal land. The law and the yearslong lawsuits that it spawns have been blamed for delays in building solar farms and transmission lines, but also oil refineries and gas pipelines.

Kavanaugh’s ruling is “pretty striking for just how strident it is, and how assertively it tries to shut the door on further NEPA litigation,” Nicholas Bagley, a University of Michigan law professor who studies the permitting system, told me. Kavanaugh’s message to lower courts is, in essence, “We keep telling you to knock it off. You keep not listening. So knock it the fuck off,” Bagley said.

At the very least, the ruling suggests that a new phase in the effort to reform the country’s permitting laws has arrived. Now that movement has, in essence, been blessed by the Supreme Court.

The case in question — Seven County Infrastructure Coalition v. Eagle County, Colorado — concerns an 88-mile railroad proposed to connect the Uinta Basin in eastern Utah to the national freight rail network. In 2021, the Surface Transportation Board, a federal agency that regulates railroads, approved the project after completing a roughly 3,600-page study of the railroad’s potential environmental impact.

Almost immediately, environmental groups argued that the board’s study did not go far enough. The ground beneath the Uinta Basin is rich in a waxy and particularly carbon-intensive crude oil; right now, very little of that oil is extracted because the only way to get it out is by truck, along windy mountain roads. The railroad, if built, would allow for much larger volumes of crude to be transported out of the basin and sent to Gulf Coast refineries. Building the railroad, in other words, would indirectly increase local oil extraction, and thereby raise global greenhouse gas emissions.

The board argued that its NEPA study did not need to consider these downstream effects because the board itself does not regulate oil extraction — that is, it regulates the building of railroads, not what gets moved on them.

The eight justices agreed that the board was right: It didn’t have to consider the effects of second-order oil drilling when it approved the railroad. (The railroad remains on hold for other reasons, Sambhav Sankar, a senior vice president at Earthjustice, told me.) But by going further in his ruling, Kavanaugh entered into a running debate about the role of NEPA and other permitting laws in the American economy.

NEPA was never meant to play the commanding role that it does today, Kavanaugh writes. When it was first signed into law in 1970, NEPA was meant to act as a “purely procedural” check on federal decision-making. Agencies were supposed to conduct environmental studies, make their decisions, then move on. But in a famous 1971 ruling concerning a proposed nuclear power plant in Maryland, Judge Skelly Wright of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals transformed the law. He found that agencies had to carry out NEPA’s procedural requirements “to the fullest extent possible,” and crucially that courts could reject agencies’ analysis for lack of completeness.

Over the years, as hundreds of cases following Wright’s have added up, NEPA has turned into a “fearsome project killer,” Bagley said. Agencies spend decades of person-power and hundreds of thousands of dollars to prepare fastidious environmental reviews of their decisions. Any new infrastructure project or new policy change — even New York City’s congestion charge — requires some form of NEPA study.

Many conservatives have long opposed the modern NEPA process. But in recent years, some liberals have joined them, arguing that the law primarily slows down clean energy infrastructure and encourages NIMBYism. In practice, they say, NEPA acts as more of hindrance to the clean economy than the old fossil fuel economy: Because of a 2005 law, most oil and gas drilling has been exempt from the NEPA process, while wind farms, solar plants, and other forms of zero-carbon energy infrastructure still have to face it. Environmental groups rebut that the law is a useful tool to slow down fossil fuel pipelines, which do not generally get a NEPA exemption.

Data supports the idea that NEPA holds back clean energy projects, but that is partly because it holds back so many kinds of projects. The R Street Institute, a center-right think tank, has found that 42% of projects stalled by NEPA involved green infrastructure or conservation. Another analysis from the Center for Growth and Opportunity at Utah State University found that it takes more than two years on average for federal agencies to complete environmental reviews of solar and wind projects. Reviews for new hydroelectric or nuclear power plants take even longer.

Kavanaugh, in essence, rejects all of this. NEPA was never supposed to block or hinder large-scale energy or infrastructure projects, he writes; it was meant to “inform agency decision-making, not to paralyze it.”

“A 1970 legislative acorn has grown over the years into a judicial oak that has hindered infrastructure development ‘under the guise’ of just a little more process,” he says. When federal agencies write environmental studies under NEPA, courts should broadly defer to the decisions that they make. And even if an agency gets something wrong in its study or omits something important, that does not mean the entire study — and the decision that it justifies — should be thrown out. (There’s some irony to Kavanaugh’s call for deference to agencies here, given that the Supreme Court rejected the idea that agency regulations deserve deference last year.)

“What’s notable for me is that they didn’t just rule on the case,” Sankar, the Earthjustice lawyer told me. (Earthjustice participated in the case.) “They decided to take a broad swipe at NEPA itself, really unnecessarily.”

Alexander Mechanick, a senior policy analyst at the Niskanen Center and former White House regulatory lawyer, agreed with Sankar about the scope of the ruling. The court’s decision “does communicate over and over again, with a heavy hand, a real desire to get lower courts out of the business of fly specking the environmental impact assessments,” he told me.

It’s this forthrightness that seems to announce a new era of NEPA jurisprudence — one where the courts will accept a level of environmental review that they may have once rejected. In a way, Kavanaugh’s ruling is a fitting sequel to Wright’s 1971 decision in that both set the tone and capture the overarching environmental concerns of their respective eras, Bagley said.

Half a century ago, Judge Wright wanted to make sure that the American public could slow the wave of infrastructure that threatened to overwhelm the country’s landscape. NEPA represented “the commitment of the government to control, at long last, the destructive engine of material ‘progress,’” he wrote, asserting that judges must make sure the law’s goals are not “lost or misdirected in the vast hallways of the federal bureaucracy.”

Now, Kavanaugh seems to fear that progress itself has been held up. He writes that the modern NEPA process, with its cycles of “speculation and consultation and estimation and litigation,” has slowed down infrastructure projects and driven up their cost. He can sound more like an op-ed writer than a legal scholar as he lays out the law’s consequences in the ruling:

Fewer projects make it to the finish line. Indeed, fewer projects make it to the starting line. Those that survive often end up costing much more than is anticipated or necessary, both for the agency preparing the EIS and for the builder of the project. And that in turn means fewer and more expensive railroads, airports, wind turbines, transmission lines, dams, housing developments, highways, bridges, subways, stadiums, arenas, data centers, and the like. And that also means fewer jobs, as new projects become difficult to finance and build in a timely fashion.

In this declaration, Kavanaugh seems to put himself on the side of a growing and tenuously bipartisan movement to reform NEPA. A 2023 debt ceiling bill, signed by President Biden, included modest reforms to the NEPA process, imposing page limits and deadlines on the strictest forms of environmental studies. A more sweeping bipartisan effort to change the law failed last year. Now, House Republicans are taking their own crack at revising NEPA, creating an optional and more expensive permitting “fast track” for developers in the reconciliation bill.

Sankar, whose organization has championed NEPA, argues that the ruling’s practical upshot will be to allow the Trump administration greater leeway to build fossil fuel infrastructure. Kavanaugh’s ruling exhibits “a shocking disregard for the realpolitik of what's going on with this administration in particular,” he said.

“As we’ve been saying all along, NEPA gets demonized as the problem,” Sankar said. With the law’s role reduced, “I think people will see that there are a lot of other things that are the problem here, and taking federal agency expertise out of the equation is not going to hurry things up.” He added that state and local governments often rely on federal NEPA reports for their own analyses, and now those reviews may be less trustworthy.

Bagley, who has generally supported permitting reform efforts, agreed that NEPA is just one of several laws holding back clean energy projects nationwide. But it is an important one, he said, and reducing its scope will likely allow more projects to happen. He added that by changing it, advocates will learn of additional bottlenecks that are holding back construction — including laws that nobody has noticed yet because they were previously less important than NEPA. Advocates can also now focus their attention on state and local barriers to building.

“If you want to look at the permitting burdens across the United States, probably 80% to 90% of them are state and local. This [ruling] isn’t going to inaugurate a new era of American dynamism,” Bagley said. “It’s a small step in the right direction.”

Most of the cancelled projects were part of the Industrial Demonstration Program, which was created by the Inflation Reduction Act and designed to help commercialize decarbonization solutions that were past the early experimental stage, but were also not quite ready for mass deployment.

Proponents of the program found the DOE’s decision outrageous. “They’re not building an economy — they’re dismantling it and giving away the future of manufacturing,” Evan Gillespie, a partner at the advocacy group Industrious Labs, said in a statement. Canceling these projects is “handing the competitive advantage to Europe, China, Canada, and other nations that are making significant investments in clean manufacturing while leaving the U.S behind,” he added.

The Kraft Heinz Food Company, for example, was supposed to get $172 million to swap out fossil fuel-fired boilers and other heating equipment for electric heat pumps and solar thermal systems at 10 of its factories. “This project seeks to help a major American brand achieve deep decarbonization and serve as an example for other U.S. food and beverage companies to reduce emissions from process heat while reducing energy costs,” the original award from the DOE said. Diageo, the liquor conglomerate, and Kohler, the kitchen and bathroom appliance brand, were also among the awardees.

Cement production is one of the biggest sources of industrial emissions in the world, and also among the most difficult to decarbonize due to an integral chemical reaction that releases carbon into the atmosphere regardless of whether the plant burns fossil fuels. Experts aren’t sure yet what the best solution will be, and the DOE program awarded a variety of projects to test different pathways.

Heidelberg Materials, one of the largest cement companies in the world, was going to get $500 million to demonstrate the first cement plant to capture and sequester its carbon emissions in the U.S. A company called Sublime Systems that’s using an alternative chemistry and electric currents to make cement was supposed to receive $87 million to build its first commercial-scale factory in Holyoke, Massachusetts. Just last week, Sublime signed a deal to supply 623,000 metric tons of zero-carbon cement to Microsoft, in part to support the tech giant’s data center buildout. Another company called Brimstone was awarded $189 million to produce low-carbon cement alongside alumina, the base material used to make aluminum.

“Given our project's strong alignment with President Trump's priority to increase U.S. production of critical minerals, we believe this was a misunderstanding,” a spokesperson for Brimstone told me. “Brimstone's Rock Refinery represents the only economically viable way to produce the critical mineral alumina in the U.S. from U.S.-mined rocks. As the first U.S.-based alumina plant in a generation, our project — which would also make Portland cement — would clear a 'mine-to-metal' path for U.S. aluminum production, fortifying the U.S. critical mineral supply chain and creating thousands of jobs.”

Sublime also shared a statement asserting that its technology would enable the Trump administration’s priorities. “We continue our bipartisan appeal to leaders who recognize that investing in American-invented breakthrough industrial technologies can address multiple policy priorities in tandem to the benefit of Americans from all walks of life,” Sublime said. The company added that it has “prepared for the possibility of this disappointing outcome” and is “evaluating various scenarios that leave our scale-up unimpeded.”

Oil and gas companies were also hit. A $332 million grant to help Exxon switch to low-carbon hydrogen at one of its refineries was canceled, as were $540 million in grants for the energy company Calpine to install carbon capture on its natural gas plants.

“It is hugely disappointing to see these projects canceled — projects that had already progressed through a rigorous, months-long review process by technical experts at DOE,” Jessie Stolark, the executive director of the Carbon Capture Coalition, said in a statement. While Wright said the terminations would generate taxpayer savings, Stolark argued they were depriving Americans of economic benefits. “Every dollar invested by the American taxpayer can lead to up to $4 in economic output through additional supply and material orders, job creation, and broader economic benefits to regional economies,” she wrote, citing a Department of Energy-authored analysis.

None of the awardees responded to my inquiry as to whether they would consider pursuing legal challenges. According to the law under which the program was created, the funding was to be awarded “on a competitive basis,” based on the expected greenhouse gas emission reductions from the project and its potential to provide the greatest benefit to the greatest number of people. Additional criteria in the agency’s application process said it would evaluate projects based on the “degree to which the applicant assesses and demonstrates potential market competitiveness and sustainability for the proposed project, technology, and manufactured product(s) through market analysis and offtake agreements.”

Notably absent from the list of canceled projects is a grant for the steelmaking company Cleveland Cliffs. Earlier this month, I reported that the company was renegotiating its award under the Industrial Demonstration Program. On an earnings call, its CEO said it was abandoning plans to use clean energy and instead looking to use the funds to extend the life of its fossil fuel-fired blast furnace.

If gone unchallenged, the funding is not likely to be re-awarded to other projects. The budget bill that is currently working its way through Congress would rescind any money from the Industrial Demonstrations Program that isn’t under contract.

He’s obviously not the first to realize this. DAC companies and their scientists are well aware of the challenges they face. But investors are generally comfortable taking on risk across a host of different technologies and industries on the premise that at least a few of their portfolio companies will hit it big. As such, a nascent market and challenging physics are not inherent reasons to steer clear. DAC’s potential to secure cash-rich oil and gas industry buyers is pure upside.

Most prominent climate tech venture capital firms — including Lowercarbon Capital, Breakthrough Energy Ventures, Prelude Ventures, and Khosla Ventures — have at least one DAC company in their portfolios. At One Ventures itself has backed everything from producing oxygen on the moon (while also decarbonizing steel) to indoor solar cells and thorium-powered nuclear reactors, a hobbyhorse of techno-optimist nuclear bros and former presidential candidate Andrew Yang. So the fact that Chi won’t touch DAC is no small deal.

His hesitation stems from a matter of scale.To capture that 0.04% of atmospheric carbon, many DAC companies use giant fans to pull in large volumes of air from the atmosphere, which then pass through either a solid filter or a liquid solution that chemically captures the carbon dioxide. Although some companies are pursuing alternate approaches that rely on passive air contact rather than energy-intensive fans, either way, the amount of air that reaches any DAC machine’s so-called “collection aperture” is minuscule “relative to the scale of planet Earth,” Chi told me.

He views this as the core pitfall of the technology. “Half of the [operating expense] of the system is just trying to go after a technical disadvantage that you took on from day one,” Chi said. “By comparison, nature based restorations have enormous apertures,” Chi told me. “Think about the aperture of all the forests on the planet. Think about the aperture of all the soils on the planet, all the wetlands on the planet, the ocean.” His preferred methods of carbon removal are all nature-based. “In addition, their sequestration tends to be photosynthesis-powered, which means we’re not burning natural gas or using grid electricity in order to go make that thing work.”

Nature-based solutions often raise eyebrows in the carbon removal and reduction space, though, bringing to mind highly questionable carbon offsets such as those earned via “avoided deforestation.” The inherent counterfactual — would these trees really have been cut down if we didn’t buy these credits? — is difficult to measure with any certainty, and a 2023 investigation by The Guardian found that the majority of these types of credits are essentially bogus.

This same essential question around measurability plagues everything from afforestation and reforestation to soil carbon sequestration, biochar application, and wetland restoration. It’s extremely difficult to measure how much carbon is stored — and for how long — within complex, open ecosystems. On the other hand, engineered solutions such as direct air capture or bioenergy with carbon capture and storage are simple to quantify and promise permanent storage, making them attractive to large corporate buyers and easy to incentivize via mechanisms such as the federal carbon sequestration tax credit.

When I put all this to Chi, his response was simple. “It’s not an advantage to be able to measure something that can’t solve the problem,” he told me. For a moment, it seemed as if we had hit an intellectual dead end. For now, carbon removals and reductions are mainly driven by the voluntary carbon market, where prices are based on the exact tonnage of carbon removed. Reputable buyers don’t want to be burned again by investing in difficult to quantify offsets, and the current administration certainly doesn’t seem likely to step in with nature-based removal mandates or purchasing commitments anytime soon.

Chi’s answer to this conundrum is “financial enclosure,” essentially a fancy way of saying we need to monetize the value of nature-based systems. In many cases, he admitted, we don’t quite yet know how to do that, at least in a way that benefits the common good. “We figured out how to financially enclose a forest, clear cut it in order to go make board feed and paper and pulp,” he explained. But we don’t know how to financially enclose the benefit of preserving said forest, nor many other ecosystems such as wetlands that serve as highly effective carbon sinks.

At One Ventures has backed companies that work with a variety of buyers — from national governments to mining companies and farmers — that have a financial stake in (or are legally required to care about) ecosystem preservation and restoration. “Sometimes people break nature hard enough that it becomes that obvious. And then they have to go fix it,” Chi told me. “We’re going to invest in the companies that make it possible to go do that at incredibly low cost structures.”

One portfolio company, Dendra Systems, uses robots, drones, and other automated methods to do large scale ecosystem restoration, such as replanting mangroves in parts of the world such as Myanmar and Abu Dhabi where they’ve been cleared for property development or industrial use. The governments of both countries are paying Dendra to do this after realizing that removing mangroves had catastrophic consequences —- destroying subsistence fishing, wrecking erosion breaks — that would cost more to ameliorate than simply replanting the trees.

Then there’s Dalan Animal Health, which is developing vaccines for honeybees as hives become more vulnerable to disease. While not directly focused on carbon removal, the company has successfully “financially enclosed” pollination, as industrial farmers whose crops depend on pollinators will pay for the vaccine. This helps restore healthy ecosystems that can ultimately draw down more carbon. Chi told me that insurance companies have also shown a willingness to pay for nature-based solutions that can help lessen the impact of disasters such as floods or hurricanes.

While the carbon benefits of these companies are simply a bonus, the firm has invested in one pure play removal company, Gigablue. This startup releases engineered particles into the ocean that attract carbon-absorbing phytoplankton. As the particles accumulate more plankton, they sink to the ocean floor, where the carbon is then stored. Using onsite sampling and other advanced techniques, Chi told me that this tech is “very measurable” while also having an “aperture [that] is as wide as the ocean area that we’ve sprinkled things onto.”

Though Chi dislikes the illogical nature of the voluntary carbon market — he would much prefer a “polluter pays” system where money is directed towards nature-based sequestration — he knows that with the markets we have, precise measurability is paramount. So At One Ventures is throwing money at this, too. Portfolio company Chloris Geospatial combines satellite data and machine learning to measure biomass from space and track changes over time, helping legitimize forest-based removals. And Miraterra is focused on novel sensing tech and advanced modeling that allows farmers to calculate the amount of carbon in their soil.

But even if the carbon stored in natural ecosystems never becomes quite as measurable as engineered carbon removals, Chi thinks investors, companies, or governments should still be going all in. “When your volume is so much larger, then you can even throw big error bars around your measurability and still be miles ahead,” he told me.

Many investors say they want it all. You’ll see them funding nature-based and engineered carbon removal companies alike in an effort to take a “portfolio approach” to carbon removal. Chi, unsurprisingly, thinks that’s hogwash. “It’s weasel words to be like, it’s an important part of this portfolio,” he told me. The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change also advocates for a diversified approach, without saying DAC itself is strictly necessary. DAC is “not going to do 1%, and it’s going to be massively more expensive than your other 99%,” Chi said. “At some point you’re going to be like, why is this in the portfolio?”

It’s certainly a more blunt assessment of the industry’s viability (or lack thereof) than I’ve heard any investor hazard before. But there may be more folks starting to come around to Chi’s perspective. With government support for DAC in question and the utility of carbon capture tax credits — which only benefit engineered removals — deeply threatened, venture funding for DAC is down over 60% from this time last year, Bloomberg reported.

Rajesh Swaminathan, a climate tech investor at Khosla Ventures told the publication that while many investors have taken bets on direct air capture, “Now, people are stepping back and saying, ‘Why didn’t I look at the economics there?’” Khosla itself is an investor in the DAC company Spiritus.

So what’s a longterm skeptic like Chi to do in this moment of doubt? As he told me, “I’m just going to keep on giving talks on it, and I know that physics is on my side.”",https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81OTgwNjYwMS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2ODQ3Mjc1Nn0.vfqr1uzX4ulM_uSBkkrgvJsN9jfuRvw0UzE29xz-H-s/image.jpg?width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C100%2C0%2C100,N,,2025-06-02 08:05:47.725378

But, to realize the full potential of a bio-based economy, bioindustrial manufacturing must scale significantly.

As nations double down on bioeconomy investments, a coordinated, international approach will be essential to harnessing biomanufacturing’s potential and ensuring a resilient future.

The industrial application of biotechnology to produce a huge variety of products – ranging from food ingredients to speciality chemicals and advanced biomaterials – could accelerate the transition to a more resource-efficient, resilient global economy. It’s estimated that up to 60% of the physical inputs to the global economy could, in principle, be produced biologically, offering a transformative opportunity to reshape industrial production.

But, to realize the full potential of a bio-based economy, bioindustrial manufacturing must scale significantly. Bioproducts targeting mainstream applications, like fermented ingredients, still face challenges in achieving the unit economics necessary for widespread adoption. To bring down costs and increase output, major investments are needed to improve microbial fermentation processes, develop next-generation bioproduction technologies and build out regional biomanufacturing capacity.

In a world marked by supply chain shocks, trade disputes and global health threats, biomanufacturing is more than an economic opportunity – it’s a strategic imperative.

Governments around the world are increasingly recognizing this imperative. Countries such as the United States, the United Kingdom, China and India are ramping up national bioeconomy strategies that offer targeted support for domestic biomanufacturing. These include investments in R&D infrastructure, bioprocessing facilities, workforce development and regulatory streamlining. Such efforts aim to accelerate commercialization and to ensure that essential bioproducts can be reliably produced at home, buffering economies against international disruptions.

The industries primed for a bioindustrial revolution

1. Food

Traditional agricultural systems are deeply intertwined with global trade, making them vulnerable to both biological threats and geopolitical instability. The recent rapid spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza, which has affected over 169 million poultry worldwide, drove egg prices to record highs and exposed the fragility of supply chains. When coupled with trade disruptions, these effects can magnify into issues of national food security.

Biomanufacturing addresses this risk by enabling the domestic production of key food components like ovalbumin – the main protein in egg whites – using precision fermentation. Engineered microbes generate these proteins in bioreactors, offering a scalable, disease-resilient complement to traditional animal agriculture. This approach strengthens food security and provides a more stable foundation for food systems in the face of future disruptions.

2. Chemicals

Global chemical supply chains are exposed to geopolitical risk, largely due to the concentration of chemical production in a few key regions, including Germany, China and the Middle East. The reliance on cross-border transport to access critical materials heightens the risk of disruption, with the potential to impact entire manufacturing ecosystems. Biomanufacturing provides a compelling bio-solution: engineered microorganisms can be used to produce specialty chemicals at scale. This offers a path to domestic self-sufficiency in chemical manufacturing, reducing dependency on volatile international trade routes.

3. Critical minerals

The demand for lithium, cobalt and rare earth elements is skyrocketing, driven by the clean energy transition and the expansion of electric vehicles, batteries and modern electronics. Yet, extraction and refining of these minerals is concentrated in a handful of countries, often under geopolitical risk. Through biomining – an advanced mineral recovery technique that uses engineered microbes to extract metals from low-grade ores or mining waste – countries can produce these critical minerals more efficiently than traditional methods. By investing in domestic biomining capacity, nations can diversify their mineral sourcing and insulate key industries from external shocks.

In conclusion, biomanufacturing is emerging as a cornerstone of the global economy at a time of increased focus on building more resilient and diversified supply chains. As nations double down on bioeconomy investments, a coordinated, international approach – bolstered by public-private collaboration – will be essential to harnessing biomanufacturing’s full potential and ensuring a resilient future for all.",https://assets.weforum.org/article/image/responsive_large_r9ZvhUEmKFXgOpY2AUrrPG-ZwZ_C4FwiXKQtGbJxZyE.jpg,N,,2025-06-02 08:05:52.834636

Tariffs in Motion

Trump’s trade war is starting to bring to mind the boxing style of Muhammad Ali, who used unconventional stances and swift dodges to make opponents hit nothing but air.

That admittedly imperfect comparison comes up because once again the president has turned a tariff policy into a moving target.

Earlier this year Trump’s tactic was to impose and then pause. Now he has landed a surprise hit on the global steel and aluminum industry, declaring that a 25% tariff is about to go up to 50%. Read More

As for the tariffs Trump levied on China, what had seemed to be a move toward top-level bilateral negotiation may not be going that way just yet.

China is accusing the US of violating their existing trade deal — specifically mentioning AI chip export controls and the revocation of student visas — and says it will defend its interests. Read More

‘Administrative Errors': A federal appeals panel ordered officials not to deport a 31-year-old to El Salvador. Minutes later, it happened anyway, the New York Times reports.

The government had previously given the court what the judges called “express assurance” that it would not schedule a deportation for that migrant until the next day.

Showing the Receipts: ProPublica and the Texas Tribune cast a wide net in search of criminal records of the Venezuelan migrants deported to a maximum-security prison in El Salvador.

Their conclusion: the US government’s own data shows that officials knew that only 32 of the 238 deportees had been convicted of U.S. crimes and that most were nonviolent offenses, such as retail theft or traffic violations.

The response from White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson: “ProPublica should be embarrassed that they are doing the bidding of criminal illegal aliens who are a threat.”

When States Say No Thanks

More power isn’t an enticing prospect for states that don’t see an easy way to take over the care of battlefields, historical parks, and protected areas — a possibility that’s wrapped into the White House’s cost-cutting proposal for the National Park Service.

Of all the federal land managed by the Park Service, 63 have “national park” in their name and roughly 370 are called something else, Bobby Magill reports. To achieve the proposed $900 million cut from park operations, about 350 of those monuments, historic sites, and other protected areas would have to be offloaded, according to the National Parks Conservation Association.

Such moves would raise legal questions as well as the possibility of future generations missing out as states close sites with which they can’t afford to keep up. Read More

Did You Ace the Quiz?

The correct response is Option B – the Byrd Rule, named after its chief backer, the late Sen. Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.), known for his parliamentary procedure expertise. Give yourself a bonus point if you know where to look up the Byrd Rule: Section 313 of the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 (Public Law 93-344.)

When legislation advances under the fast-track reconciliation process, Byrd Rule guardrails require that all provisions change the level of federal spending, revenue, or the debt limit. Anything policy-focused with only incidental budgetary impact can be challenged on the floor. Then the Senate parliamentarian determines whether it’s on-point or extraneous.

Invalid language gets tossed out.

Lillianna Byington reports that even before the House voted, Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) was talking about complying with the Byrd Rule. “There’s a lot of pre-Byrd work that’s been done, but there will still have to be some scrubbing,” he said before the Memorial Day recess.

It’ll take at least a couple weeks to get a reconciliation bill (or bills) ready for the Senate floor. When the legislation comes up, Democrats from Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) on down say they’ll be ready to raise multiple Byrd Rule points of order. When you hear mentions of a Byrd bath, that’s what they’re talking about.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming the energy sector. From detecting faults in infrastructure before they happen, to improving the way power flows across the grid, AI is becoming an essential tool for power utilities transitioning to smarter and more sustainable energy system operations.

Unlocking efficiency gains for power utilities

AI and machine learning can already unlock significant operational benefits for power utilities. For example:

Detecting non-technical losses, such as electricity theft, using anomaly detection models.

Supporting faster connection assessments by analysing connection request patterns and automating some of the assessment processes.

Optimising maintenance schedules based on asset condition and usage, not just calendar dates.

These applications of AI have the potential to save our clients time, reduce costs, and increase reliability across their networks. Ricardo is already supporting organisations, including UK DNOs, to do just this.

AI in action

One of the biggest opportunities lies in how we maintain our energy infrastructure. Extreme weather, particularly heatwaves, can cause a spike in faults across power systems. But what if we could predict where and when those failures are likely to happen?

In a recent project for the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ), Ricardo developed a machine learning model to do just that. By analysing historical fault and weather data, an AI algorithm was trained to spot patterns between temperature spikes and asset failures.

Our approach

We used the National Fault and Interruption Scheme (NaFIRS) dataset, which records faults reported by Distribution Network Operators (DNOs) from 2018 to 2022, alongside historical UK temperature data. We established the relationship between temperature and fault rates using supervised machine learning (specifically, Extreme Gradient Boosting or XGBoost), looking at a range of factors including maximum daily temperature, minimum daily temperature, and daily rainfall.

The results

This resulted in a predictive model that forecasts fault risk during heatwaves with reasonable accuracy – giving network operators valuable time to prepare and respond. This is illustrated in the figure below, showing fault prediction results at low voltage.

Key lessons learned:

We learned important lessons along the way to improve the accuracy and reliability of such predictive models going forward:

The accuracy of the predictive models increases not just with the size of the dataset, but also and more significantly with its locational granularity and precision. Specifically, the closer and the more central the temperature sensor to the fault area, the easier it was to establish a relationship between fault occurrence and ambient temperature. Predictive AI models such as this one would benefit from tapping onto more localised temperature measurements, including at substations, for example.

Although we initially relied on one single dataset (REMIT, i.e. self-reported faults data from generation, transmission and consumption units in the GB wholesale market) we quickly established this was not sufficient. Expanding to more datasets including those privately recorded by distribution network operators was lengthy but instrumental in achieving better performance for the predictive AI model. Collaboration and partnerships between power utilities to pool historical dataset and thereby increase the accuracy of predictive models used by all would undoubtedly bring mutual benefits.

Benefits for power utilities

Overall, such an approach enables smarter maintenance, improves system resilience and ultimately helps to keep the lights on during some of the most challenging conditions caused by climate change.

The future of AI

AI is set to play an even more significant role going forward. Emerging techniques such as deep reinforcement learning, federated learning, and digital twins have significant potential to transform not just the digital tools used by power utilities, but their operating model altogether.

Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is a branch of artificial intelligence where algorithms learn to make decisions by interacting with an environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties, using deep neural networks to handle complex input data. DRL can be applied to optimize real-time grid operations, such as balancing electricity supply and demand or integrating renewable energy sources efficiently.

Federated learning is a machine learning approach that enables model training across multiple decentralised devices or servers while keeping data localised, thus preserving privacy and security. Federated learning could allow power companies to collaboratively develop accurate forecasting models or detect faults using data from multiple locations without sharing sensitive information.

Digital twins are virtual models of physical systems or assets that are continuously updated with real-time data, allowing for simulation, analysis, and optimisation. Digital twins enable utilities to simulate and predict the behaviour of the grid under various conditions including in real-time conditions, test new approaches and technologies including virtual power plants, and proactively address maintenance needs or system failures, thereby improving reliability and resilience.

Why Ricardo?

Our strength lies in combining deep technical expertise with a systems-thinking approach to sustainable energy solutions. We not only understand how AI tools can benefit the power system, but how they can help to solve our clients’ challenges in the wider transition. We bring together specialists in data science, energy systems, digital infrastructure and regulation, and tailor our expertise towards supporting our clients’ goals.

As AI becomes more embedded in the way we manage electricity, Ricardo can support your organisation in building power systems that are smart, resilient and ready to incorporate transformational change.",https://www.ricardo.com/media/c3uhufnm/grid-electricity-power-energy-flow-pylon_2337381931.jpg?width=1200&height=630&v=1dbd3b12bccb630,N,,2025-06-02 08:06:03.589326

That tight timeline could be bad news for lawmakers and lobby groups wanting major changes, including energy companies eager to ease aggressive tax credit rollbacks in the House-passed “Big Beautiful Bill Act.”

Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) proved naysayers wrong when he helped convince the vast majority of his caucus to support the tax cut, energy and border spending megabill, with assistance from President Donald Trump. Now, he wants the Senate to keep changes limited.

“I’ve encouraged them to do as little reworking as possible because we have a very delicate balance that we’ve maintained in the House and the Senate,” Johnson told Fox News. “We both have small majorities.”

But Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) recently said that “the Senate will have its imprint on it,” noting the House needs to get 218 votes while his chamber has to secure 51.

With Republicans coalescing around cutting back climate-related grants and increasing oil and gas drilling, the fate of Inflation Reduction Act tax credits will continue being a point of contention.

A new report spells bad news for renewable energy development. Companies canceled or delayed more than $14 billion in investments since January, jeopardizing thousands of jobs, according to the group E2.

“This so-called ‘big, beautiful bill’ is nothing short of a big, bad blow to America’s clean energy economy and a huge amount [of] jobs across the country,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said at an event in New York last week.

“It’s a job killer, a cost raiser and a giveaway to Big Oil billionaires — all at the expense of workers and American families.”

Schumer on Sunday released a letter to colleagues against what he called the “One Ugly Bill,” touting increased collaboration with House Democrats and plans to challenge provisions before the Senate parliamentarian, who decides what can pass by simple majority under the budget reconciliation process.

The legislation also includes provisions to accelerate National Environmental Policy Act reviews and natural gas project approvals, plus new fees on electric vehicles and hybrids.

Here are six things to watch:

Lobbying will intensify

Some renewable energy lobbyists say they have been saving their firepower for the Senate, where they may get more traction than in the House.

Still, it’s far from certain they will get much more. After all, more then 20 House lawmakers at one point said they wanted to keep at least some IRA credits.

Advocates did get a boost last week when Elon Musk — who just wrapped up his special government assignment — amplified a social media post from Tesla saying, “Abruptly ending the energy tax credits would threaten America’s energy independence and the reliability of our grid.”

It was something of a 180 for the world’s richest man — Tesla’s CEO — who had previously called for ending all federal subsidies. Musk also pointed out that credits benefiting fossil fuels would not be touched.

Abigail Ross Hopper, president of the Solar Energy Industries Association, seized on the newfound advocacy.

“Elon Musk and Tesla hit the nail on the head — the energy tax credits are critical to ensuring the U.S. has the power it needs to lead the world in AI and innovation,” she said in a statement.

“Rolling back credits for residential solar, utility-scale solar, and manufacturing would put our grid’s reliability at risk and dismantle one of the greatest industrial revivals in American history.”

She added, “We hope the Senate is listening.”

In recent weeks, Senate Finance Chair Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) has been meeting with lawmakers to gather input but has not been forthcoming about his plans.

Lobbyists have their eyes on a number of senators, including Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), John Curtis (R-Utah) and Jerry Moran (R-Kan.).

But others, like Cramer, have supported the House energy tax provisions, though he said he would prefer faster terminations of wind and solar incentives, calling them mature sectors.

“I think they did pretty well,” he said.

Will nuclear incentives get more generous?

Nuclear was the biggest energy winner of the House budget reconciliation package, meant to bypass the Senate filibuster, but that doesn’t mean the industry’s boosters are satisfied with the current picture.

Last-minute negotiations produced a generous carve-out for nuclear. Reactors that start construction by 2031 will continue qualifying for production tax credits. In contrast, other low-carbon energy generation like wind and solar would have to be built and plugged into the grid by 2028.

Still, nuclear advocates say the legislation’s allowances likely won’t be enough for next-generation reactors. Those technologies are a long way from becoming economically viable, and almost all of them won’t be constructed until well into the 2030s.

“You may have one or two of the leading projects be able to qualify with the new phase out dates, but in all likelihood, nothing will qualify,” said Alan Ahn, deputy director for nuclear at the center-left think tank Third Way.

Luckily for nuclear, the energy source can lean on powerful friends in the Senate, including Kevin Cramer of North Dakota and Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, chair of the Environment and Public Works Committee.

“They definitely need more time than that,” Cramer told POLITICO about the timeline for nuclear energy tax incentives. “It’s too short for truly new technologies. We’ll have to change that. I don’t think it’s fair to treat an emerging technology the same as a 30-year-old technology.”

The industry is also pushing to preserve funding for the Department of Energy’s Loan Program Office, which is widely seen as the only lending body willing to fund nuclear projects.

The House bill would claw back “the unobligated balance” of IRA funding for the Loans Program Office. But Energy Secretary Chris Wright has urged lawmakers to protect the money.

Michael Flannigan, vice president of government affairs at the Nuclear Energy Institute, said, “Our attention now turns to the Senate where [we] will work to secure the tax credits and protect federal programs like the Department of Energy Loan Programs Office authority necessary to usher in the next generation of nuclear technologies.”

Is 45V done?

Despite the currently bleak picture for renewables like wind and solar, it was actually hydrogen that received the worst deal from House reconciliation legislation.

The bill would completely eliminate a generous hydrogen-specific production credit for any projects that don’t begin construction by the end of the year, a tall task for an industry that is widely seen as still in its infancy.

“It’s gonna be trying to get from 2025 to the full 2031 phase-out date and defend why that was a good thing in the first place,” said Frank Wolak, president of the Fuel Cell and Hydrogen Energy Association. “It’s challenging times, but it’s not game over, and there’s good optimism the Senate will make these changes.”

Capito has been a defender of the hydrogen industry and has specifically advocated for a broadening the hydrogen credit in the past under the Biden administration. Many Republicans have hydrogen projects in their states, including Sens. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana and John Cornyn of Texas.

Still, hydrogen hasn’t received the same level of support from Republicans on energy sources like nuclear. If the Senate doesn’t make any changes to the House hydrogen provision, the nascent industry will be in a tough spot going forward.

“The industry stalls under the current picture, it’s pretty simple,” Wolak said. “The U.S. is going to vacate the playing field and the Chinese and Europeans are going to kind of fill whatever gaps there are in technology.”

Foreign entity rules

Renewable energy lobbyists have for weeks argued the House bill’s changes to supply chain requirements — known as the Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) provisions — are “unworkable.”

Last week, a group of battery and critical minerals advocates said while they supported barring China and other adversaries from gaining access to government incentives, the House-passed mandates are “prohibitive and confusing.”

Observers suspected House Republicans intentionally made the FEOC policies so restrictive to render the climate law credits unusable even faster.

“The Foreign Entities of Concern (FEOC) requirements in the bill are overly restrictive, effectively serving as a repeal,” said a statement from the Battery Materials & Technology Coalition, American Critical Minerals Association and the Battery Advocacy for Technology Transformation group.

“In addition, implementing these requirements at the IRS would be nearly impossible and at the very least require additional agency resources to enforce.”

But rewriting the FEOC provisions would not amount to an easy fix, industry observers noted. And what’s more, manufacturers trying to access a scaled-back 45X manufacturing credit would be hurt by the aggressive phase-downs of other incentives.

“You can make all the manufacturing here in the U.S., but if there’s no market to sell it to, there’s no credit,” said a solar advocate granted anonymity to speak candidly. “You saved 45X in name only.”

Will public land sales reappear?

Public lands sales are out of the budget reconciliation bill — for now. But Republicans in the Senate could still add them back in if there’s political will to do so.

Energy and Natural Resources Chair Mike Lee (R-Utah.) is a longtime fan of land sales. Lee told POLITICO’s E&E News that he thought provisions in the initial House bill were “great.”

Other senators, too, have said land sales were at least being discussed in the upper chamber as an offset for the legislation’s price tag. Even so, the proposition would likely run into the same problems that killed it in the House.

Sen. Steve Daines (R-Mont.) is staunchly opposed to selling off bits and pieces of the federal estate to pay for the megabill. With only a three-vote majority, Senate leadership likely won’t want to inject any additional uncertainty by selling public lands.

Other natural resources provisions are also likely to crop up in the Senate — namely, two Alaska sections that were scrapped from the House bill.

The House cut a provision to speed approval for the Ambler mining access road and language to ramp up drilling in Alaska’s National Petroleum Reserve. Leaders did so as a precaution against running afoul of Senate rules governing the budget reconciliation process.

But House Natural Resources Chair Bruce Westerman (R-Ark.) has been hopeful the measures will reemerge. That’s likely to happen, given that Alaska’s two senators are both proponents of more drilling in NPR-A and the Ambler project.

Will ‘REINS Act’ become law?

Senate hard-liners will also be working to get regulation-slashing provisions back into their version of the megabill.

Early iterations of the House’s reconciliation package would have targeted agencies’ rulemaking powers, giving Congress final approval over any “major rule that increases revenue” and expanding mechanisms for undoing existing rules.

But the deregulatory portion of the megabill, based on the “Regulations from the Executive In Need of Scrutiny (REINS) Act,” was cut just hours before the final House vote.

It was replaced with a blanket $100 million appropriation to the White House’s Office of Management and Budget to “pay expenses associated with improving regulatory processes and analyzing and reviewing rules issued by a covered agency.”

Lee, a fan of the “REINS Act,” said the last-minute change came from concerns about Senate rules surrounding the budget reconciliation process.

The House passed their bill with “placeholder” language, he said, so that Lee could re-insert deregulatory policies with language that will not run afoul of the Senate parliamentarian.

Lee spent the recess week speaking out on social media about his qualms with the megabill, saying it needs to be more forceful on spending cuts and reducing the size of the federal government. He said he is a “no” on the package, as of now.

“It isn’t yet as beautiful as it needs to be, but there’s still time to fix it,” Lee said of the bill during a podcast appearance last week. “The Senate version is going to be more aggressive.”",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/8e/7d/57c7c6e04918849f91e9bb628896/u-s-congress-13093.jpg,N,,2025-06-02 08:06:12.172492

Featured: Agents of Impact Podcast

Navajo Power is building a pipeline of utility-scale solar projects to model a just climate transition (podcast). A 750-megawatt solar project near the Painted Desert on Navajo Nation in Arizona is a model for a just climate transition. The project, led by Indigenous-owned and -led renewable energy Navajo Power, is based near the site of the Navajo Generating Station coal-fired power plant, which for 45 years generated power for Phoenix, Los Angeles and other cities. “The Navajo Nation was the battery for the Southwest,” Navajo Power’s founder and CEO Brett Isaac says on the latest Agents of Impact podcast on ImpactAlpha. The coal-fired plant’s closure in 2019 killed one of the biggest job providers on the Navajo Nation – and opened an opportunity for an economic reset. “Indigenous communities have the resource potential to site projects of the size and scale that we need,” Isaac explains. “There are not a lot of places in the country that can host [developments] like that and also have the auxiliary infrastructure – transmission lines and interconnection points – that would make them feasible.”

Community benefits. Navajo Power set out to leverage Indigenous communities’ abundant land and resources for green growth in the US, while ensuring those communities are finally able to make the call on how those resources are used, who benefits and how. The Painted Desert project is Navajo Power’s starting point for “utilizing the economic opportunities, investment and ownership to address social issues [like] high unemployment and access to infrastructure,” says Isaac (for background, see “Native-led Navajo Power leans into the just transition with community benefits and local jobs”).

Permits and approvals. It’s been a six-year journey to assemble not only the financing, but leases and approvals for the 4,500-acre project and, crucially, community support, including from dozens of grazing permit holders. Navajo Power has five projects in development, totaling more than two gigawatts, with four Tribal nations, representing about $4 billion in investment into those communities. Navajo Power has deployed about $25 million in concessionary debt and project development financing to date; it reached a $4 million first close in its Series A equity financing last December. Says Navajo Power’s COO Michael Cox, “This has never been done before by a private company. We’re carving the path.”

Dealflow: Catalytic Capital

Prime Coalition’s Trellis Climate raises capital for first-of-a-kind projects. Prime Coalition is looking to help meet the financing needs of climate tech startups on the brink of commercialization. Government funding cutbacks and a slowdown in climate tech investment have hampered companies building their first commercial plants, known as first-of-a-kind projects, or FOAKs, that don’t fit the venture capital funding model and are often deemed too risky for commercial infrastructure and debt investors. Trellis Climate, launched last year by the Boston-based nonprofit climate investor Prime Coalition, is stepping in with catalytic capital to help advance promising high-impact technologies. Prime says the impact-first, catalytic capital investment program has raised philanthropic capital from nearly two-dozen private foundations, donor-advised funds, family offices and other donors. Donors have the option to structure their contributions as recoverable grants or program-related investments extending philanthropic dollars by recycling capital when projects generate financial returns.

Made in California. Trellis has inked two deals this year, backing San Francisco-based Nitricity, which is developing a plant-based, climate-smart alternative to expensive and energy-intensive synthetic nitrogen fertilizer; and San Jose-based Tandem PV’s solar panels, which combine conventional silicon solar cells with thin-film perovskite layers for higher efficiency. Trellis backed Tandem’s $50 million Series A equity and debt round to finance a Silicon Valley demonstration plant. Trellis invested in Nitricity’s $10 million project financing round, also backed by Elemental Impact, for its California manufacturing facility that will produce organic nitrogen fertilizer using recycled almond shells and renewable energy.

SAEL Solar raises $132 million for a 300 megawatt solar plant in India. Indian developer of solar and agricultural waste-to-energy projects, SAEL Solar, has raised $132 million in debt from the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, French financial services group Societe Generale and New Development Bank, which serves “BRICS” nations. The funding will finance a 300-megawatt solar power plant in Andhra Pradesh state, which SAEL won with a competitive bid from the Solar Energy Corporation of India. The company secured $1 billion early last year from Norfund, Tata Cleantech, the US Development Finance Corporation and the Asian Development Bank to expand its solar and biomass projects.

Renewable energy uptick. India is building renewable energy generation capacity at a fast clip. It added nearly 30 gigawatts of energy to reach 220 gigawatts for the financial year of 2024 to 2025. Nearly half the growth was driven by solar; wind, bioenergy and small hydropower are picking up. Power generated from SAEL’s new plant will be sold to the solar energy corporation through a 25-year power purchase agreement. SAEL’s parent company SAEL Limited, and five subsidiaries last year raised $305 million from a US dollar-denominated green bond, which was oversubscribed by more than six times.

Signals: Climate Finance

Global Climate Finance Forum seeks to mobilize capital for locally-led solutions in the Global South. Call it the Montego Bay manifesto. In late April, a group of impact investors, policymakers and entrepreneurs gathered in Jamaica to map strategies for channeling private capital from the Global North to climate solutions in the Global South. In their sights: the COP30 global climate talks coming up in November in Belém, Brazil. The role of private capital will be even more urgent this year, with public funding, not to mention political leadership, for climate action in retreat in the US and around the globe. “The regions most vulnerable to climate shocks – yet where targeted investments could generate outsized benefits for communities and ecosystems – continue to be severely under-resourced in their climate efforts,” says Marilyn Waite of the Climate Finance Fund, a philanthropic fund is supported by the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation and hosted by the European Climate Foundation. That’s especially true, she said, for small businesses that operate in capital-scarce environments.

‘MoBay’ to Belém. Waite’s fund underwrote the inaugural Global Climate Finance Forum to workshop strategies for mobilizing private finance for climate-focused small- and mid-sized businesses, or SMEs, and develop an action plan for the COP30 proceedings. The three-day forum generated some three-dozen recommendations and commitments. Among them: tax incentives to encourage institutional and retail investors to invest in Global South-listed equities, bonds, and private funds, and a registry of investable climate-focused small businesses and regional aggregators to facilitate deals. Other ideas included piloting blended finance structures that pair local asset managers with Global North institutional investors, and addressing currency mismatch through fund-level innovations and cross-border learning. The ideas will inform a “Montego Bay Letter” to COP30 organizers that aims to elevate Global South SMEs in the talks.

Global majority. Jamaica was chosen as a location in part for its accessibility. Climate advocates from emerging markets now face even more onerous visa requirements for events in the US and, if they can get in, steep costs (disclosure: Climate Finance Fund picked up the cost of accommodations for attendees). Jamaica is visa-free for nearly 100 countries. “Global conversations should not happen in places the Global Majority cannot access,” says Waite. The 50 or so delegates to the form hailed from 17 countries, including Bangladesh, Brazil, China, India, Nepal and Rwanda, Trinidad, and Tobago. “SMEs are the engine of our economy and their role in climate action is pivotal,” said BRAC Bank’s Tashmeem Muntazir Chowdhury who attended from Bangladesh.

The Republican backed tax-package being considered in Congress includes provisions that would repeal clean energy tax credits that some say have been transformational for a state like Arizona. It's all part of the huge budget bill that looks to advance President Donald Trump's agenda on several issues and includes provisions that would phase out a number of clean energy tax investments passed because of the Biden era Inflation Reduction Act.

Christian Stumpf, director of external affairs of The Nature Conservancy, said billions of dollars and thousands of jobs in Arizona are in jeopardy.

""The IRA has truly been a catalyst for infrastructure investments across Arizona. We've really increased our state's leadership position in the clean energy economy and we are providing good paying jobs that are putting Arizonans to work. We just can't afford to let that go away,"" he explained.

Since the passage of clean energy investments in 2022, companies have announced dozens of clean energy projects and created over 13,000 jobs in rural and urban Arizona communities - many of which are 'red' districts. But some provisions in Trump's ""big, beautiful"" bill have sparked concerns among Republicans who feel the repealing of credits would negatively impact energy production and the economy. If changes are made in the Senate, the legislation will need to be passed by the U.S. House again.

While some Republicans in Congress have questioned the impacts of the IRA and have opposed it because they claim it would raise taxes without helping curb inflation, Stumpf said it has been ""nothing but a success so far,"" and encourages local elected officials to advocate for the clean energy investments that have been made possible.

""We're having really positive conversations on both sides of the aisle and we're hopeful that both sides can come to meaningful compromise. We are trying not to see this through a Republican or Democrat lens,"" he explained. ""We really think that there is a strong case to be made for economic vibrancy and supporting sustainable communities.""

The company has not yet confirmed the plant’s fate, though the likelihood of sustained operation seems slim. PV Tech has contacted Meyer Burger for confirmation of the plant’s future.

Taken together, the two German subsidiaries employ over 600 people: 331 at the Thalheim manufacturing plant and 289 in “mechanical engineering and technology development” in Hohenstein-Ernstthal, in Saxony.

Meyer Burger Switzerland – the company’s headquarters, in the city of Thun, which employs 60 people – and Meyer Burger Americas, which recently laid off all its staff, will apparently continue to exist as companies.

Meyer Burger also said it is requesting an extension of the deadline for its 2024 financial report, which was due on 31st May. It already asked for an extension earlier this year.

What’s left of Meyer Burger?

A slow decline which began last year accelerated into collapse last week. On Thursday, following sustained net losses over the first half of 2024, PV Tech reported that Meyer Burger had laid off employees at its module manufacturing facility in Goodyear, Arizona. The following day, the company confirmed the end of operations at the site and the termination of its US jobs.

With the insolvency of its German subsidiaries, and crucially the Thalheim cell production plant, Meyer Burger has a very small footprint remaining. With no employees at the US business (though it will remain in existence), the company may soon effectively just have its headquarters in Switzerland to its name.

Meyer Burger’s downfall reflects difficult solar manufacturing conditions in both the US and the EU. In recent months, uncertain tariff and trade policies, as well as the possible rollback of Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) incentives by the Trump administration, have made the future of US solar manufacturing uncertain, where until recently it was a favourable investment environment.

However, some see Meyer Burger’s loss as a specifically European problem. Former CEO of the company, Gunter Erfurt, said that the news of German insolvencies left him “shocked, deeply moved and very sad”.

In a post on LinkedIn, Erfurt said: “With great courage, energy and creative drive, a unique team from Saxony and Saxony-Anhalt has set out to rewrite an important European chapter: the reconstruction of its own, resilient solar industry.

“However, this courage and determination was once again countered by political hesitation in Berlin and Brussels. Despite widespread agreement in the solar industry, it has once again not been possible to effectively counter China’s market-distorting efforts for dominance in the solar industry with a clever industrial policy and to support the development of its own strong industry.

“At Meyer Burger, this led to the closure of what was then Europe’s largest solar module production facility – brand new, state-of-the-art, fully automated. All other European competitors also had to give up or take a break.”

The European Commission recently announced additions to its Net Zero Industry Act (NZIA) legislation to support domestic clean energy manufacturing, including solar PV.

Last week, the Commission confirmed that state renewables auctions must include “non-price criteria” for the equipment they procure, with a mandate for 30% of annual auction volumes to be met by “resilient” supply. The head of the European Solar Manufacturing Council (ESMC) called this a “major step forward” towards rebuilding European solar supply.

But the European industry is still floundering, with little meaningful solar manufacturing capacity. Meyer Burger’s cell and, formerly, module facilities in Germany had historically been a leading light of the European PV manufacturing industry; its collapse will be a blow.

It’s probably because federal incentives may be going away soon, and the price of the units is likely heading north.

Despite what the name suggests, heat pumps both cool and heat buildings by exchanging the air within a building with an outside source, such as the air, water, or ground. They have a strong track record of using less electricity than central cooling systems and window air conditioners, and they don’t directly burn fossil fuels like furnaces. Shipments of new heat pumps actually surpassed gas furnaces in 2022 as the leading source of heating and cooling systems. That popularity has been supercharged this year, as building owners are now rushing to install heat pumps out of concerns over the impact of tariffs on prices, as well as fears the federal tax incentives will sunset in the new bill being put forth in Washington, D.C., as WBJ Managing Editor Eric Casey reports in his “Cooler & warmer” story.

The U.S. Senate still has to take up the legislation, and the Senate would be wise to eschew the short-term thinking surrounding Trump’s anti-clean energy wave and consider the long-term impact of scuttling so many initiatives that have helped build this important sector, with the majority of those incentives going to Republican-leaning states. Our country will need to generate enormous amounts of energy over the next couple decades, and supporting clean energy projects is not only good for the economy and job growth, but also our long-term future.

EVs will continue to be costly if battery prices, which are the largest expense of any electric car, continue to rise.
Prices for lithium-ion battery packs fell 20% in 2024, the largest drop since 2017, according to a study from the International Energy Agency (IEA).
Cheaper batteries mean cheaper EVs, and electric cars and trucks remain the main driver of battery demand.
According to the survey, China is also responsible for about half of the worldwide EV battery market, which is made up of LFP batteries.","The good news is that EVs get cheaper when batteries get cheaper. The bad news is that battery prices in China continue to decline more quickly than in the US.

Batteries are at the centre of the battle for a transportation system with zero emissions. EVs will continue to be costly if battery prices, which are the largest expense of any electric car, continue to rise. However, prices will drop if batteries can be produced or obtained locally and at a low cost.

With its Gigafactory in Nevada, Tesla was able to work this out early on. This is also the reason why automakers like Ford, Toyota, and General Motors are planning their own battery facilities, with differing degrees of success thus far.

Prices for lithium-ion battery packs fell 20% in 2024, the largest drop since 2017, according to a study from the International Energy Agency (IEA).

Cheaper batteries mean cheaper EVs, and electric cars and trucks remain the main driver of battery demand.

China’s price advantage is widening over the rest of the world.

However, there is some good news as all automakers, battery suppliers, and energy providers race towards that future: a recent study by the International Energy Agency (IEA) found that global prices for lithium-ion battery packs dropped 20% in 2024. Since 2017, that is the largest single price decrease.

This predicament can be attributed to heightened competition, greater supply, and rising demand. “Lithium prices, in particular, dropped nearly 20% in 2024, reaching similar prices to those at the end of 2015, despite lithium demand in 2024 being about six times bigger than in 2015,” claimed the paper.

Current surpluses are the cause of the cheap prices of essential minerals, which is excellent for EV costs now but may result in underinvestment later.

According to the survey, battery pack prices decreased across all markets. However, China saw the largest declines, which should come as no surprise. In terms of supply chain security and general technological advancement, that nation is far ahead in the battery race.

“China was responsible for 80% of global battery cell production in 2024, while the remainder was produced in the United States, the European Union, Korea and Japan,” according to the research. “The faster pace of battery cost reduction and innovation in China has been enabled by fierce competition that has driven down profit margins for most producers (though not all), at the same time as driving up manufacturing efficiency and yields, as well as access to a large, skilled workforce.”

It’s interesting to note that, although being much smaller than EV batteries, hybrid batteries are more costly, against popular belief. “The price of such components is spread across fewer battery cells, increasing the price per kilowatt-hour,” according to the research. “In 2024, the average price of a 20 kWh PHEV battery pack—roughly the global sales-weighted average for standard plug-in hybrids—was about the same as a 65 kWh BEV battery pack.”

The market is also being significantly impacted by China’s near-total lead in lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries. Long regarded as a less expensive alternative for EVs, LFP batteries’ performance has greatly increased as a result of ongoing development, making them far more appropriate for mass-market automobile use than before.

According to the survey, China is also responsible for about half of the worldwide EV battery market, which is made up of LFP batteries. Because to anti-China tariffs, their use in the US stayed at 10% in 2024, although growing by almost 90% in the EU. Meanwhile, the rest of the world is being mostly dominated by LFP batteries.

“Market penetration of LFP batteries is moving even faster in other markets,” according to the research. In 2024, over 50% of electric vehicle batteries in Southeast Asia, Brazil, and India used LFP. While locally made automobiles, primarily from Tata Motors, are the main driver of LFP uptake in India, imports from China, primarily from BYD, are the main driver in Southeast Asia and Brazil. Meanwhile, Japan and South Korea are also accelerating the development of LFP batteries.

Let’s move on to more good and negative news. The United States is slowly catching up on the first front. “Manufacturing capacity in the United States grew by almost 50%, led by Korean companies attracted by tax credits, which accounted for nearly 70% of the growth in 2024,” according to the research. “This led installed capacity in the United States to surpass that in the European Union, which nonetheless increased by 10% in 2024 despite the Northvolt plant in Sweden being halted following its bankruptcy.”

However, if President Donald Trump’s budget package is approved into law, those tax benefits may soon disappear. Both EV tax subsidies and tax incentives for domestic battery manufacturing are about to be eliminated by the so-called Big, Beautiful Bill. Both are being cut in a current version that was approved by the US House of Representatives and is currently making its way through the Senate.

In the end, the worldwide battery boom is here to stay. However, it is still unclear if America wishes to be included.",https://www.evmechanica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/EV-Battery-Prices-Dropped-20-Over-Last-Year.jpg,N,,2025-06-02 09:10:52.322026

Mumbai: India's green economy is growing rapidly and is expected to reach a value of $1 trillion by 2030, and a staggering $15 trillion by 2070, a new report said on Monday.

With this massive growth, India is also set to create a huge number of green jobs -- around 7.29 million by the financial year 2027-28 and 35 million by the year 2047, according to a NLB Services report.

NLB Services CEO Sachin Alug said: ""In the past 4-5 years, we've seen green jobs evolve from niche roles to mainstream opportunities across renewable energy, EVs, and sustainable infrastructure. What's changed pragmatically is the skillsets.""

""Today's green workforce needs both sustainability know-how and digital fluency, and the increased integration of AI, IoT, blockchain, GIS, and data-driven tools are laying the foundation for progressive, new-age green careers,"" Alug mentioned.

As the green sector expands, industries are not just investing in green technology and renewable energy, but also focusing on building a skilled workforce to meet the rising demand.

This shift is driving companies to change their hiring strategies. Rather than relying only on traditional degrees, employers are now giving more importance to practical green skills and hands-on experience.

Many companies are also working closely with colleges and universities to equip young people with sustainability-related skills, while also investing in inclusive hiring and re-skilling programmes, the report stated.

The new employment outlook is stronger than earlier predictions. In 2024, the green sector was expected to grow at a pace of 15-20 per cent annually in terms of job demand.

However, new estimates show an even faster increase, especially in fields like renewable energy, electric vehicles, green construction, waste management, and sustainable textiles.

Most green jobs are still based in big cities like Mumbai, Bengaluru, and Delhi. But smaller cities such as Jaipur, Indore, Visakhapatnam, Coimbatore, Bhubaneswar, Chandigarh, and Ahmedabad are also becoming key green job hubs.

Tier II and Tier III cities are expected to create 35-40 per cent of the projected 7.29 million jobs by FY28, helped by the growth in sustainable agriculture, logistics, and warehousing, as per the report.

Green job roles are also becoming more diverse. Demand for professionals in areas such as ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) analytics, climate data analysis, and green technology is growing fast, with a projected 20-30 per cent yearly rise.

GRAMERCY — For several months, a River Parishes refinery unlawfully discharged industrial toxic waste containing arsenic, cadmium, chromium and other toxic heavy metals into public areas and waterways, state records show.

The company, Atlantic Alumina, also known as Atalco, has so far racked up 23 violation notices from the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality after inspectors first discovered the pollution in August. It involves a slurry of industrial “red mud” byproduct that has eroded through the giant levees surrounding the facility’s waste containment lakes and spilled onto public property. The toxic sludge has killed vegetation and contaminated the land along its path to a local drainage system that flows to the Blind River Swamp of Lake Maurepas, according to a 606-page LDEQ inspection report finalized in March.

The incident marks the first known case of red mud levee breaches at an American bauxite refinery. When asked for details, LDEQ spokesman Gregory Langley had little information to share about the prolonged discharge other than to say it is currently under investigation with the agency’s enforcement division. The only enforcement action taken as of May 29 is a warning letter LDEQ sent to Atalco.

A review of thousands of pages of state and federal documents and interviews with scientists and area residents indicate that Atalco polluted public land and state waterways with the most toxic non-radioactive elements on the planet and allowed that pollution to continue for months — never notifying the outside community.

Atalco’s refinery occupies roughly 3 square miles of land where St. James and St. John the Baptist parishes meet on the Mississippi River’s east bank. The site specializes in refining bauxite, a rust-colored powder of raw metals and minerals, into aluminum oxide or “alumina” in the form of an ultra-fine white powder. Atalco sells the alumina to metal smelters that need it to make finished aluminum. Opened in 1958 as Kaiser Aluminum, the Gramercy facility is the only remaining bauxite refinery in the United States and therefore the nation’s only domestic source of a critical metal feedstock.

Atalco produced 669,261 metric tons of aluminum oxide last year, state records show. For every ton of aluminum produced from Atalco’s work, bauxite refining generates an estimated 2.5 tons of waste byproduct, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

One of the main problems in refining bauxite is there are not many good options for what to do with all that waste, most of which takes the form of a thick red mud.

The waste comes from a part of the process in which bauxite is heated in a pressurized vessel with sodium hydroxide, a highly caustic chemical. The alumina compounds are then filtered out and separated, while the toxic byproduct is stored in the facility’s six red mud lakes. The lakes are open-air ponds, each roughly 150-200 acres in size surrounded by large earthen levees, some as high as 50 feet, meant to contain the thick liquid waste.

Four of the lakes, including a “surge” or overflow basin, were constructed in the early 1970s without any liners that would help prevent the heavy metals and chemicals from seeping into the soil below.

“It is very dangerous,” said Slawomir Lomnicki, an environmental scientist at LSU. “There can be a lot of toxic metals leaching out of it and getting into the groundwater.”

Groundwater contamination from leaching is a constant risk that exists when Atalco’s systems are operating normally. The public drinking water system in St. James Parish regularly monitors for that kind of contamination, according to Parish President Peter Dufresne. Officials with the St. John Parish water system did not answer multiple phone calls last week.

A greater risk to the community from bauxite refineries in general is the rare case of a levee breach at a red mud lake, which can cause toxic waste to directly contaminate public waters and soils, scientists said.

Until this reporting, the last known breach at a bauxite refinery occurred in Hungary in 2010. The failure of a red mud reservoir sent 35 million cubic feet of waste into nearby villages, killing 10 people and injuring 150 others.

In the wake of that incident, industry officials told the American public that a levee breach at Louisiana’s bauxite refinery would be unlikely because the levees are “periodically checked by state and federal regulators,” according to a news report from that time.

That unlikely event has happened at Atalco. With a caustic level higher than drain cleaner and elevated concentrations of heavy metals, Atalco’s waste slurry eroded through levees in multiple locations at multiple lakes, forming canyons as deep as 10 feet that allowed the toxic waste to escape, records show.

A water sample LDEQ had tested from a public ditch outside the plant detected arsenic at a concentration nearly 1,400% higher than the level considered safe by state groundwater and EPA drinking water limits. The sample also contained cadmium at levels above those same limits.

A soil sample taken from the same ditch contained mercury, beryllium, cadmium and chromium — all at concentrations above the average background levels found in U.S. soils. The cadmium was nearly 400% higher, and the chromium was 900% higher than LDEQ’s standard limits for soil. Chromium is the most toxic non-radioactive element on earth and is about three times more poisonous than arsenic, according to EPA toxicity factors.

Historic water quality data for the Blind River, recorded from 1979-99, show heavy metal concentrations nowhere near those levels.

When the levees broke

“With this kind of facility, the worst major accident that can happen is a breach of the lake [levees],” said Corinne Gibb, a chemist who works with the environmental watchdog Louisiana Bucket Brigade. The group has monitored incidents at the alumina refinery for years.

It is unknown when the mud lake levees first began to erode, but state and federal records show the pollution lasted for months and continued even after Atalco became aware of the problem.

The company has not responded to the Illuminator’s multiple requests for an interview.

Federal inspectors with the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) documented several hazards at Atalco’s levees last summer and voiced concerns about the risks they posed to the workers at the plant.

“There were several mud lakes at the facility that was (sic) not being maintained,” MSHA inspector Brandon Olivier wrote in a citation dated June 25, 2024.

Trees and shrubs obscured sections of the levees, making thorough inspections impossible, Olivier added.

A few weeks later, on Aug. 14, the MSHA issued Atalco another citation after inspectors discovered caustic waste “seeping through various locations on the east and west side of Mud Lake #4” and flowing downhill “into the roadway and ditches.”

LDEQ later noted the Aug. 14 citation was the first formal written notice Atalco received about the levees having a breach with dangerous toxic waste escaping from its facility.

Other dangers present at the Atalco plant had already drawn regulators’ attention at that time.

Just days prior, on Aug. 4, the public was reminded just how dangerous the chemicals at Atalco could be when 45-year-old Curtis Diggs, a contract worker from Waste-Pro USA, fell into a pit of sodium hydroxide at the plant because a grate that covered the pit was missing and the entire floor was flooded with several inches of the caustic cloudy liquid. The chemical, the same that is stored in the red mud lakes, left Diggs with severe burns from which he did not recover, according to LDEQ records. He died in a New Orleans hospital on Sept 2.

MSHA investigated the fatality and learned that Atalco personnel had removed the grate on July 30, 2024, to try to pump out the flooded area and failed to put anything in its place or even a warning marker, creating a dangerous pitfall left open for five days and virtually invisible. MSHA charged Atalco with three regulatory violations and charged Waste-Pro USA with two, faulting both companies for “aggravated conduct” that involved an extraordinary pattern of negligence, though it’s unclear if any fines or penalties have been issued as of May 30, according to federal records.

Atalco uses sodium hydroxide to refine bauxite into alumina. After the refinement process, it stores the used sodium hydroxide in the lakes with the other waste.

Despite the heightened scrutiny from state and federal regulators at the time, by mid-September Atalco still had not repaired the levee breaches to Red Mud Lake 4 that federal inspectors cited the month before. Nor did the company thoroughly inspect its other lakes to look for similar breaches because, as the records indicate, similar breaches were there — if only the company had looked.

On Sept. 17, MSHA inspectors found a breach in the levee around another lake, Red Mud Lake 1 East, with a stream of hazardous waste flowing freely across the roadway.

“The caustic was observed seeping through the side of the levee for approximately 50 yards across the roadway and to the ditch,” the citation states. “The mud lake is access[ed] by the plant operators daily and contractors for service, and this condition exposes them to injuries if there is a dam failure due to the seepage.”

Based on further inspections that same day, MSHA cited Atalco for a third levee break — at Red Mud Lake 2.

On that single day, three of Atalco’s six waste lakes had confirmed breaches with streams of poisonous chemicals flowing freely to areas they weren’t permitted to go, including the Blind River Swamp — a popular recreational fishing spot in the Lake Maurepas backwaters.

LDEQ officials first arrived at the plant Sept. 20 to initiate a routine compliance inspection. Agency records show state officials met with Atalco managers, conducted an interview and toured parts of the facility. However, they were unable to inspect some of the lakes and levees because the plant manager told them the access roads were too wet to travel on.

LDEQ first documented the levee breaches five days later when they were contacted by the federal inspectors, according to state records. Atalco had still not officially notified LDEQ of the levee breaches — something the company should have done immediately upon learning of them in accordance with Atalco’s permit requirements as well as state and federal laws.

Local officials have also been kept in the dark. When asked about the events during an impromptu meeting with a reporter Thursday at the State Capitol, St. James Parish President Peter Dufresne said he was unaware of Atalco’s levee breaks that contaminated neighboring land and drainage with toxic waste. Dufresne declined an interview but asked the Illuminator for copies of LDEQ’s inspection reports.

In October, the records show, state inspectors discovered erosion channels in the levee of a fourth lake, Red Mud Lake 3. They also saw for themselves the levee breaches that federal inspectors documented two months before. The erosion channels were still there, and the caustic waste was still escaping from those lakes.

So much waste had escaped that it also overwhelmed the facility’s secondary containment system, which is a network of interior ditches just outside of the levees used to catch any chemical spills or leaks from the lakes. The backup ditch at one location had overflowed, sending the toxic slurry across the highway just north of the Veterans Memorial Bridge.

Atalco was also, as a matter of protocol, unlawfully using a stormwater ditch as a backup containment ditch. Three company officials, apparently unaware that they weren’t permitted to use the ditch for toxic waste disposal, told LDEQ inspectors that they routinely used it for containment, according to the inspection files.

In other areas, LDEQ inspectors saw that the waste slurry had accumulated to “nearly the height of the levee” in some of the lakes, the agency’s files note. The waste level in the lakes should never be allowed to rise higher than two feet from the top of the levee.

Ultimately, in site visits over the next three months, LDEQ inspectors viewed and documented levee breaches at four of Atalco’s six lakes, prompting the state agency to cite Atalco multiple times for failing to inspect and failing to repair the levees.

Erosion of the levees was a very real possibility that Atalco had long known about. In its 2010 permit renewal applications with the state, the company had addressed the topic at length, promising to prevent erosion by conducting daily inspections of the levees and keeping written logs of those inspections. The state included those as specific ongoing requirements in the final permit issued to Atalco. At that time, the company was in the process of raising its levees from 30 feet to 50 feet high, according to the permit application.

By the time state and federal officials began prodding the company last August, Atalco had not consistently inspected its lakes and levees in over three years and was missing hundreds of daily inspection records from July 30, 2021, to Dec. 18, 2024, according to LDEQ’s summary of violations.

On Oct. 23, state officials noted the company was constructing a new berm to contain the breach at Red Mud Lake 4, which Atalco had known about since at least Aug. 14.

The breach at Red Mud Lake 3 continued until Dec. 4, according to the LDEQ file. On that day, Atalco managers accompanied state inspectors into the field when they noticed multiple streams emerging near an access road and traced it back to “one erosion channel with an estimated depth of at least 10 feet.”

The chemistry of Atalco’s toxic waste

During their site visits in October, the state inspectors took pH readings from various pools of standing waste that had escaped from the lakes

The pH scale ranges from 0 to 14, with water having a neutral pH of around 7. Lower values indicate acidity, while higher values indicate alkalinity. Substances at the extreme ends of the scale in either direction can eat through solid materials such as steel and concrete and are very dangerous to most life forms.

The LDEQ detected high pH at every location, with one puddle logged at a high of 12.49 — the same alkalinity as most caustic drain clog removers and ammonia-based cleaners. The inspectors also photographed dead or dying vegetation, petrochemical sheens, and white and yellow chemical residues in many of the locations where the slurry had traveled.

“Just the pH by itself is concerning … That is very high,” Gibb, the chemist, said. “You would definitely get injuries and skin burns from it. The plants and any fish in the area would die from that. You can’t survive that high of a pH.”

State inspectors had testing done on water and soil samples from off-site locations in the public drainage system and on-site locations near the erosion streams. Simultaneously, Atalco personnel collected their own batch of samples and sent them to a separate lab for independent testing.

LDEQ’s soil samples contained significantly elevated levels of cadmium, chromium and nickel — all toxic carcinogens. Atalco’s samples reaffirmed the LDEQ’s lab results and detected even higher levels at one location. The company’s sample taken from public property outside the facility contained cadmium at roughly 1,000% higher than what the state considers safe for people. Additionally, the levels of chromium and nickel measured 1,700% and 300% above their respective state standards, the lab reports show.

Gibb and Lomnicki, the LSU scientist, said these three heavy metals, along with arsenic, are among the most dangerous non-radioactive substances on the planet. Exposure to excessive levels can cause a range of serious health issues, including cancer and blood poisoning.

Ganga Hettiarachchi, a Kansas State University professor of soil and environmental chemistry, said cadmium could pose the greatest long-term risk because it spreads easily and accumulates in living organisms over time. Enough small doses during a given time period can add up to a fatal dose, she said.

Cadmium is highly toxic to humans in short- and long-term exposure settings. Small concentrations ingested or inhaled can cause gastrointestinal or respiratory illness, while higher concentrations can cause cancer, cell death, neurological damage and organ system failure, according to the National Institutes of Health.

Increasing the risk from cadmium is that it can be easily spread across far distances and transfer from soil into crops, Hettiarachchi said, posing risks to humans and animals if they eat those crops.

“It could easily end up in our food,” she said. “That has been historically the main pathway for cadmium.”

If cadmium gets into surface water or groundwater, it can become an even bigger problem, especially if that water is used for irrigation, she added.

“The area of damage can expand further and further over time,” Hettiarachchi said.

Cadmium was present at elevated levels in two of Atalco’s water samples and four of LDEQ’s. The highest concentration was 400% above the level considered safe in a water sample taken from an erosion channel within the perimeter of the facility. It also had high levels of chromium and lead.

All seven water samples that LDEQ had tested contained elevated levels of arsenic. One of them taken from outside the levee of a red mud lake detected arsenic at a level 9,000% higher than state and federal safe limits, and it contained high levels of cadmium, nickel and thallium. Six out of the seven samples Atalco personnel collected contained arsenic at levels beyond what is considered safe.

LDEQ has yet to address the risks Atalco’s red mud runoff could pose to the community. Langley, the agency’s spokesman, said it has yet to determine what the public impact might be.

“Obviously those are things we don’t want going into state waterways,” Langley said.

Part Two: For some nearby residents, the levee breaches at Atalco are just the latest incident in a familiar pattern. The second story in this series reveals why the incident at Atalco was foreseeable based on the history of the plant and the many accidents and environmental exposures to the nearby communities.

“They’re turning a blind eye to it,” said Gail LeBouef, who’s lived near the plant since 1999.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Atalco-1.jpg,N,,2025-06-02 07:14:50.306713

Now, the incentive programs that attracted Panasonic to Kansas are jeopardized by the Trump administration’s attacks on clean energy, and the De Soto plant may be the last of its kind.

3, with renewable energy producing enough energy in Kansas to meet 74% of the state’s electricity consumption.","The $4 billion Panasonic battery factory in De Soto should have been a first-of-a-kind project for Kansas and the Midwest.

In addition to the estimated 4,000 new jobs coming to town, Panasonic and the state expected another 4,000 jobs to come from suppliers they anticipated would move to Kansas to provide additional goods and materials the plant would need for its operations. And in 2024, there was momentum based on growing demand for electric vehicles and low-cost renewable energy to have this kind of growth replicated in states throughout the Midwest.

Now, the incentive programs that attracted Panasonic to Kansas are jeopardized by the Trump administration’s attacks on clean energy, and the De Soto plant may be the last of its kind. Already, more than $14 billion in new energy projects (and the loss of 10,000 potential new jobs because of it) have been canceled or delayed as spending on new projects is paused.

Attracting what will be the largest battery factory in the world to the heart of the Midwest required big incentives — including more than $800 million from the state and the promise of billions in tax incentives from the federal government. These batteries are intended to support the growing domestic manufacturing of electric vehicles and expansion of low-cost renewables for utilities that are experiencing load growth for the first time in decades as a result of the AI boom.

The incentive programs were crafted to ensure that America could remain competitive in a 21st-century global economy that will increasingly be electrified and powered by clean generation from geothermal, nuclear, solar and wind energy, with batteries as the backup. And importantly, the benefits of these incentives in the form of new manufacturing plants and well-paid manufacturing jobs would be shared across America.

‘Saudi Arabia of wind energy’

The Midwest has been dubbed the Saudi Arabia of wind energy. Five Midwest states rank among the Top 10 nationwide for the percentage of total state electricity consumption that is generated by renewables. Notably, Kansas stands out at No. 3, with renewable energy producing enough energy in Kansas to meet 74% of the state’s electricity consumption. Battery plants to support the consumer demand for electric vehicles are popping up in Ohio and, of course, Kansas — and were meant to be built in more towns like De Soto.

And yet, the renewable energy and electric vehicle industries, driven in large part on two key technologies developed in the United States — photovoltaic cells and lithium-ion batteries — are facing an all-out attack by the Trump administration. These irrational headwinds from the administration and Republican-controlled state legislatures in the Midwest are likely to impede the ability of the region to benefit from the expansion of clean energy manufacturing plants and the data center growth for the artificial intelligence industry, which will locate where there is cheap land and low-cost energy.

My parents grew up in the Midwest. My grandfather was an executive at Kansas City Power & Light Co. (now Evergy) and my father grew up in Flint, Michigan, during the Depression. The opportunity and transformation that new manufacturing like the Panasonic plant represented for the Midwest region gave me hope that the government and industry were finally investing in the hometowns my parents had left behind.

Although I may have values based on my Midwest roots, I was born and raised in the Bay Area and had a front-row seat as the innovation engine that is Silicon Valley created enormous opportunities and wealth for California and the San Francisco area. The expansion of low-cost renewable energy and the manufacturing plants to support that expansion present an opportunity for the Midwest to participate in the next major innovation cycle. In addition, the rich renewable energy resources of the heartland, along with available land, has made the region an epicenter of the data center build-out that will power the AI revolution.

For the United States to compete in a global market for energy supplies, the global transition to electric vehicles and the new world of AI, we need policies that support innovation and where market economics and a level playing field determine the best solutions. Policies that impede the expansion of renewable energy projects and defund research to further drive down the cost of these clean energy resources will not create economic development in the Midwest, and will hinder U.S. competitiveness in the markets that will drive the global economy throughout the 21st century.

Midwesterners should unite in support of the policies that are now under threat. They can build a future of economic abundance and prosperity for the region that our parents and grandparents would be proud of.",https://www.kansascity.com/latest-news/5b5jsj/picture307465371/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/panasonic%20battery%20plant%20de%20soto.JPG,N,,2025-06-02 07:13:24.421073

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency implemented regulations last year requiring water providers to test and treat the “forever chemicals” to almost zero by 2029. But the agency pivoted last month, proposing to rollback certain PFAS restrictions, while extending the compliance deadline to 2031.

Delaware lawmakers say restricting PFAS in drinking water statewide is crucial to ensure that residents’ health is protected. The legislation years in the making passed Delaware’s Senate in May, and awaits a House vote this month.

“This is a serious health issue, so we need to make sure that we’re doing everything we can here in the state of Delaware, regardless of what is done at the federal level,” said state Sen. Darius Brown, the bill’s sponsor.

PFAS, widely used in consumer products such as nonstick cookware and waterproof clothing, as well as in firefighting foam, have been linked to serious health problems, including some cancers, thyroid disease, developmental delays in children and other health conditions.

The health risks associated with PFAS, which can stay in the human bloodstream for years, have sparked numerous lawsuits against chemical manufacturers, such as DuPont and 3M.

Delaware is no stranger to PFAS contamination. Its largest city, Wilmington, is known as the chemical capital of the world and is home to DuPont, which used PFAS chemicals to manufacture its products, such as Teflon. However, PFAS chemicals have been detected across the state, including in the cities of Dover and in Blades, as well as in rivers and streams.

Senate Bill 72, introduced in March, would require Delaware water providers to begin testing for PFAS in January 2026, and reduce PFAS levels in drinking water by 2029. The legislation mirrors the EPA’s regulations adopted last year, restricting two types of PFAS — PFOA and PFOS — to 4 parts per trillion.

The EPA last month pivoted from its Biden-era PFAS regulations, proposing to give water providers another two years to comply. The agency also plans to scrap limits entirely for three other types of PFAS — PFHxS, PFNA and GenX — as well as limitations on a mixture of several types of forever chemicals.

The change comes after water providers sued the EPA last year, arguing that the treatments required to meet the regulations are too costly, and would hit the pockets of ratepayers. While former President Joe Biden set aside billions of dollars to address PFAS, water providers say more resources are needed, and several utilities have sued polluters to help pay for the cost of treatment.

Though PFOA and PFOS are most commonly detected across the U.S., chemicals such as PFHxS are frequently found in communities near airports and military bases, where firefighting foam has been discharged.

Residents who live near the Wilmington Airport in New Castle have exceedingly high levels of PFHxS in their blood from drinking contaminated water, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The contamination is associated with the National Guard’s use of firefighting foam on a base at the airport.

Al Fidance is among the New Castle residents with high PFAS levels in their blood, and said he was concerned about the EPA’s proposal to scrap restrictions on certain chemicals.

“The things that you think are in place to protect you, look like a lot of that’s going away,” he said. “It’s going to be a mess. I don’t like it.”

Clean water advocates say the legislation in Delaware, which would restrict PFHxS, PFNA and GenX to 10 parts per trillion, is critical. The state would use funds from a DuPont settlement to help water providers reduce PFAS over the next decade.

“The higher the amount of concentration of PFAS in people’s blood increases their risk for developing a disease that’s linked to these PFAS,” said Tracy Carluccio, deputy director of the Delaware Riverkeeper Network. “It’s more important than ever if the EPA is weakening and backing out [of regulations], the states step up in order to protect the public health of the residents of the state.”",https://whyy.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/bigstock-Pouring-Drinkable-Water-Into-G-407464253.jpg,N,,2025-06-02 07:14:53.754334

LEXINGTON, Ky. (June 2, 2025) — The demand for accurate chemical monitoring sensors is rising globally, as industries continue to grapple with the legacy of manufacturing waste.

New commercial mobile monitoring platforms can be part of the solution to this rising challenge, provided they meet the same high standards as previous monitoring technology. Industry-academic partnerships are making this possible, advancing state-of-the-art detection science.

Globally, more than 5 billion sites exist that are contaminated with legacy industrial wastes and require remediation before they can be reused and/or redeveloped. Despite recent efforts to change manufacturing practices, the legacy of waste contamination and generation persists.

“Chemical wastes are part of our society,” says Kelly G. Pennell, Ph.D., the Earl Parker Robinson Chair Professor of Environment and Sustainability in the UK Stanley and Karen Pigman College of Engineering.

“The idea of zero-waste is both an aspirational goal and an elusive goal,” said Pennell. “We know that manufacturing ecosystems are being rapidly disrupted. As a result, there will be unintended, unimagined and uneven consequences of industrial waste that impact the health and environment in communities in various geographic locations.”

That’s why Pennell’s team at the University of Kentucky Superfund Research Center, which was funded by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, collaborated with Entanglement Technologies, located in the San Francisco Bay Area, over the past decade to create meaningful solutions to the chemical waste challenge.

A recent study, published in the journal ACS Omega, describes the research team’s quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) framework to advance the technology readiness-level of mobile chemical monitoring instruments as they become commercially available.

UK graduate student Herman Tay led the work, with Pennell and a leading expert from GSI Environmental Inc., to use Entanglement’s AROMA-VOC sensor — a chemical analyzer — as the model for this QA/QC systematic framework.

“We are excited to be part of such an important collaboration that enables mobile monitoring to grow and fill the gap in characterizing the impact of manufacturing waste on local communities,” said Tony Miller, CEO of Entanglement Technologies. “Our AROMA instruments have evolved to meet the rapidly changing needs of industry and communities worldwide.”

The instrument the research team discussed in this recent publication — AROMA-VOC — has transitioned considerably since Pennell first met Miller to collaborate on a 2016 field study of a superfund site in the San Francisco Bay area.

During the 2016 study, Pennell and Miller maintained close interactions with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), community stakeholders and collaborated with environmental consultants from Clearwater Group and chemical analysis experts at Beacon Environmental.

“The field study provided an opportunity for Entanglement to conduct measurements and make discoveries within the context of a regulated hazardous waste site. The field study with Kelly and her students came at a pivotal time for us. We were transitioning AROMA-VOC towards a mobile design and the field study provided an opportunity to learn in real-time about users’ needs, challenges and opportunities,” said Miller.

Now, AROMA-VOC fits neatly and compactly in the back of a vehicle and can be driven to various locations for chemical monitoring.

Entanglement Technologies has experienced tremendous growth, fueled, in part, by strategic partnerships. Its new mobile technology is used by dozens of groups in the United States — including regulatory bodies conducting air quality monitoring such as the EPA, California Air Resources Board, Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, industry monitoring fenceline, indoor air and stack emissions, and other universities like Stanford, Baylor and Colorado State. The use of AROMA has even extended overseas and internationally to Canada, the Netherlands and South Korea.

Since 2021, when Entanglement Technologies developed the most sensitive analyzer to measure the critical air toxic ethylene oxide in the ambient environment, the company has outgrown its manufacturing space and significantly expanded its team and operations.

The partnership between Pennell’s team and Entanglement shows how vitally important research collaboration is to the global economy — enabling sustainable growth and innovation across industry sectors.

The Trump administration has swiftly reversed course, reportedly planning to eliminate any caps on greenhouse gas emissions from coal-fired and natural gas-fired power plants.","A federal award funding a collaboration between Kentucky’s largest utility, the University of Kentucky and other partners to implement a new system capturing greenhouse gas emissions is among two dozen energy-related awards the Trump administration terminated last week.

The $72 million award terminated by the U.S. Department of Energy funded the testing of a carbon capture system on a natural gas-fired turbine operated by electric utility Louisville Gas and Electric and Kentucky Utilities at its Cane Run Generating Station in Jefferson County.

Carbon capture refers to technologies that seek to reduce climate-warming carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels by capturing and storing carbon dioxide before it’s released into the atmosphere. The utility described the project last year as an “important step in assessing the future viability” of carbon capture technology for natural gas-fired power plants. LG&E and KU, which serves more than 1 million customers in the state, would have captured a portion of carbon dioxide emissions to be potentially reused by a nearby manufacturer, according to a press release.

Liz Pratt, a LG&E and KU spokesperson, in a statement said the utility was “disappointed” the award was terminated but remained “focused on driving innovation and important research and development in this space.”

“​​Together with our project partners, we will review our options for advancing this important research project,” Pratt said.

Among the other awards terminated Friday by the DOE included a number of other carbon capture and storage projects and a project by multinational alcoholic beverage company Diageo that sought to add batteries to decarbonize production facilities including in Shelbyville, Kentucky.

U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright in a Friday statement said canceling the approximately $3.7 billion in total awards was “in the best interest” of Americans.

“While the previous administration failed to conduct a thorough financial review before signing away billions of taxpayer dollars, the Trump administration is doing our due diligence to ensure we are utilizing taxpayer dollars to strengthen our national security, bolster affordable, reliable energy sources and advance projects that generate the highest possible return on investment,” Wright said in a statement.

Investment into carbon capture systems played a large role in the energy policy of the former Biden administration, which sought to require utilities with coal-fired power plants operating past 2039 to capture 90% of carbon dioxide emissions from the plants or have those plants retire by 2032. That carbon capture requirement also applied to new natural gas-fired power plants. The Trump administration has swiftly reversed course, reportedly planning to eliminate any caps on greenhouse gas emissions from coal-fired and natural gas-fired power plants.

Supporters of carbon capture technologies generally say it’s necessary in transitioning to clean energy and addressing industries that are hard to decarbonize, while skeptics, including environmentalists, question whether the technologies will allow for the further burning of fossil fuels.

Byron Gary, an attorney with the environmental legal organization Kentucky Resources Council, told the Lantern the award termination fits into the Trump administration’s “broader strategy” of “trying to undermine climate regulation.”

E&E News reported Friday that the Trump administration is expected to argue the U.S. power sector, a major contributor of greenhouse gas emissions, doesn’t contribute “significantly” to climate change.

Gary said while his organization would rather see investment into zero-emission renewable energy paired with utility-scale batteries, the award terminations appear to ensure carbon capture technology isn’t a “viable option” for the future.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_1095-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2025-06-02 10:03:19.405734

The Tennessee Valley Authority is considering extending the life of its coal plants.

Or, at least, that is what the utility is saying publicly.

“TVA is very concerned about how they are being viewed by the Trump administration,” said Stephen Smith, director of the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy.

TVA currently operates four coal plants: Kingston, near Knoxville, Cumberland, near Clarksville, Gallatin, about 30 miles from Nashville, and Shawnee, in Paducah, Kentucky.

In 2021, TVA announced a plan to retire all coal plants by 2035. Two of the coal plants, at Kingston and Cumberland, are scheduled to close completely by 2027 and 2028, respectively, and be replaced with equivalent gas generation.

“Substantial performance and cost risk is carried by operating a coal fleet reaching the end of its useful life,” TVA wrote at the time. “Unplanned outage rate, a component of availability, is the primary driver of challenges.” Many Tennesseans experienced this firsthand during Winter Storm Elliott two years ago, when TVA issued rolling blackouts after coal and gas plants failed.

But earlier this month, TVA changed its tune, shortly after President Donald Trump signed executive orders aimed at reviving the coal industry and granted TVA exemptions to Biden-era coal pollution regulations.

“We’re evaluating our coal units’ lifespans,” TVA’s new CEO Don Moul said during a recent board meeting. “We continue to depend on them to help power this region.”

Moul declined an interview request from WPLN News about the possible extensions. Wade White, a member of the TVA Board, the utility’s main regulator, also declined an interview with WPLN News at a meeting in early May.

TVA undermines one of its key arguments for new fossil fuel generation

TVA may find it difficult to extend use of the Kingston or Cumberland coal plants, because the utility would have to get permission to emit two kinds of dangerous fossil fuel pollution simultaneously, as new gas plants at those sites come online. All four of the utility’s coal plants rank among the top five climate polluters in Tennessee and Kentucky — with Cumberland consistently ranking as the top emitter. Air pollution from these plants is also linked to hundreds of premature deaths each year.

Or TVA could burn coal longer if any gas plant construction gets behind schedule. But that undermines one of TVA’s main arguments for building new gas plants in the first place: its self-determined deadline for coal retirement.

When proposing a 1.5-gigawatt gas plant for Kingston, for example, TVA suggested that the gas plant was the only option for generation because of how quickly it needed to shut down the coal plant — an argument scrutinized by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency last year.

“TVA dismisses the lower costs, lower financial risks, and far superior environmental performance of [the solar option] by arguing that solar cells could not be installed by 2027,” EPA wrote in a letter to the utility. “The imperative of 2027 closure of the [Kingston coal plant] is not adequately disclosed. If closure by 2027 is an imperative, then TVA created an alternative that is technically infeasible and therefore not a viable alternative.”

More: In Tennessee, who uses the most fracked gas? | WPLN News

TVA’s own transmission queue challenges this idea. As of January 2025, the utility had about 8.6 GW worth of solar and battery projects, with requested dates of June 2025 or later, waiting to be developed and added to the grid. That is more power than TVA’s entire gas buildout this decade.

Last year, TVA said it takes an average of “5.4 years” for a solar project to come online, but experts say TVA could speed up the rate at which it’s bringing solar projects online.

“If TVA had the proper ambition and motivation, they could be building out solar and storage to scale,” Smith said. “They choose not to, and they choose then to mislead the public that it’s not possible.”

TVA made a similar argument for the Cumberland site a few years ago. That coal plant is the largest in the fleet, providing a capacity of roughly 2.4 GW. TVA plans to add a nearly 1.5-GW gas plant on site and a 0.9-GW gas plant in Cheatham County, about 20 miles from Nashville.

TVA stressed the need to have replacement generation by 2026 to replace the first of the coal plant’s two units.

“If the first Cumberland unit must stay in operation beyond 2026, significant investment would be required to maintain safe and reliable operations and comply with environmental regulations,” TVA wrote in an environmental review. “Operation beyond 2026 would also inject operational risk back into the TVA system due to the deteriorating condition of the coal units.”

So, why would TVA now say it is considering keeping its coal plants running longer?

The U.S. ‘national energy emergency’

President Donald Trump declared a “national energy emergency” on his first day in office.

This was not an effort to mitigate the climate crisis. The Trump administration purged those words from government websites, and reduced or cut scientific reports, data tools like the “billion-dollar disasters” database, and scientists from the federal workforce.

The Senate will also soon consider the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” which would repeal tax credits for clean energy development in the nation’s first big climate law — which has a special provision for the Tennessee Valley Authority — and incentives for consumer purchases on items like electric vehicles and solar water heaters. The new bill threatens the national trend: Solar, wind and batteries were forecasted to make up 93% of new electric generation this year. (However, that isn’t the Tennessee trend.)

Trump instead wants to boost fossil fuel production. Many of his executive orders aim to expedite oil and gas projects and reduce regulations on pollution.

For context, the U.S. became the world’s largest producer of gas in 2011, surpassing Russia, and the largest producer of oil in 2018, surpassing Saudi Arabia. The nation reached record fossil fuel production under Biden. Some scientists and environmentalists say the U.S. is now, under Trump, a “petrostate.”

Trump also wants to salvage the declining coal industry, which may partially explain TVA’s willingness to open the conversation on extensions.

“Much of this is a political discussion that TVA is having publicly to send a signal to the Trump administration that they’re responding to some of Trump’s desires,” Smith, the director, said.

Coal use has been waning for over a decade, largely due to cheaper options like gas and renewables. Nearly all coal plants in the U.S. are more expensive to run than the cost of building renewable replacements, according to a 2023 study by Energy Innovation, without factoring in tax credits or environmental regulations.

More coal was retired during Trump’s first administration than during the Biden presidency or Obama’s second term.

Although coal remains the dirtiest fuel for energy, Smith said, Trump has created a pathway for delays.

“We’re seeing lots of things starting to slip in the wrong direction,” Smith said. “The environment doesn’t care about politics. The physics are going to happen, and that’s what we’re most worried about.”",https://wpln.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/06/Cumberland-TVA.jpg,N,,2025-06-02 06:02:29.436124

Line 5 Tunnel Project DEIS Opens Public Comment Period Through June 30

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Detroit District, published the long-anticipated Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) for the Line 5 Tunnel Project on May 30, 2025. The document opens a formal 30-day window for public comment that will run through June 30, 2025.

The project, proposed by Enbridge Energy, seeks to build a tunnel beneath the Straits of Mackinac to house a segment of the Line 5 pipeline, which transports crude oil and natural gas liquids through Michigan. The Corps’ DEIS evaluates a range of environmental, cultural, and legal implications associated with the proposal.

The 3.6-mile tunnel would replace the current Line 5 Dual Pipelines, which rest on or are anchored to the lakebed. According to the DEIS, construction activities and the permanent tunnel footprint could result in long-term environmental degradation across up to 38 acres of lakebed, along with measurable impacts on wetlands, air quality, public recreation, and tribal cultural resources.

The full document is available at line5tunneleis.com, and comments can be submitted online, by mail, or during two virtual public hearings scheduled for June 18 and June 25.

Environmental Study Covers Broad Range of Potential Impacts

The DEIS outlines the Corps’ assessment of multiple alternatives to the tunnel, including a No Action option, a rock-and-gravel cover solution for the existing dual pipelines, and several decommissioning scenarios. The Corps analyzed potential effects on water quality, wetlands, endangered species, transportation, air quality, noise, navigation, and tribal treaty rights.

Lt. Col. Wallace Bandeff, Detroit District Commander, emphasized the importance of public input, stating, “Public participation is an important part of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) process to ensure a thorough environmental analysis, and an effective, consistent and well-informed decision.”

The Corps also affirmed its intent to honor federal trust responsibilities to Tribal Nations and comply with laws such as the National Historic Preservation Act, the Endangered Species Act, and NEPA.

Environmental Risks and Mitigation Measures Addressed in Army Corps Report

The DEIS identifies direct and cumulative impacts that vary depending on the selected alternative. Under Enbridge’s Preferred Alternative—building a concrete tunnel under the Straits—the report anticipates:

Long-term loss of forest land for staging areas and equipment

Permanent alteration of underwater geology and aquatic habitat

Noise and light pollution affecting nearby parks like the Headlands International Dark Sky Park and Colonial Michilimackinac

Risk of spills or fluid releases during tunnel boring and horizontal directional drilling operations

While Enbridge asserts that the tunnel design minimizes explosion risks and offers secondary containment, public comments raised concerns about methane pockets, seismic stability, and contamination from construction and maintenance activities.

To address these risks, the Corps outlines a suite of mitigation measures, including monitoring protocols, stormwater management, and post-construction ecological restoration. However, the draft emphasizes that several decommissioning options could lead to greater short-term disturbance depending on whether pipeline segments are removed entirely or left in place after cleaning.

Treaty Rights and Cultural Impact Under Separate Review

In addition to its NEPA obligations, the Corps is evaluating the tunnel’s potential effect on historic properties and treaty rights in consultation with federally recognized tribes. These findings will be included in the final Record of Decision, expected in fall 2025.

The review includes Section 106 compliance for cultural heritage considerations and a treaty rights analysis to determine whether the project would infringe upon rights granted in historical agreements with Indigenous nations.

Federal Permit Decision Hinges on EIS Findings

The Corps is reviewing Enbridge’s permit application under Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 and Section 404 of the Clean Water Act. A final decision on whether to issue a Department of the Army permit will depend on the conclusions drawn in the final EIS and input gathered during the public comment period.

This review process has drawn intense interest across Michigan, where environmental groups, tribes, local governments, and residents have debated the risks and benefits of a tunnel under one of the Great Lakes’ most sensitive areas. Enbridge maintains that the tunnel would reduce the risk of spills and improve pipeline safety. Opponents argue it would prolong Michigan’s dependence on fossil fuels and threaten Lake Michigan’s ecosystem.

According to EPA, methane emissions in the United States decreased by 19% between 1990 and 2022.” Measurements in the field have repeatedly shown that reported methane emissions far understate actual releases.
Elsewhere, the report discusses methane emissions from the gas supply chain, but does not consider methane emissions from coal mines that feed coal-fired power plants.
China, the world’s largest importer of LNG, stopped taking U.S. gas entirely in March in response to U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods.
Symons said the ongoing pipeline buildout could commit the U.S. to significantly larger LNG exports for decades to come.","More than three-quarters of new gas pipeline capacity currently under development in the U.S. would feed additional liquefied natural gas exports rather than supporting domestic energy needs, a new report concludes.

Greenhouse gas emissions tied to that new capacity would be far larger than the current climate pollution from all coal-fired power plants nationwide, according to the report, published Monday by the Center for Energy & Environmental Analysis. CEEA is a recently formed think tank based in Arlington, Virginia, that focuses on energy and environmental policy.

“The money flowing to gas pipeline infrastructure is not slowing and is intended to push US gas production even higher from its current record levels,” Jeremy Symons, president of the CEEA and a former federal climate policy advisor, said in a written statement. “This buildout will extend our dependency on natural gas for decades to come, slowing the transition to cleaner, more affordable alternatives.”

Planned natural gas transmission pipelines would add 99 billion cubic feet per day of additional capacity, a figure just below the total volume of U.S. natural gas production in 2024, according to the report. The 10 largest planned pipelines across the country—and 80 percent of total capacity of active pipeline projects—are intended to export gas overseas as LNG, based on the authors’ assessment of federal data and other public records.

The additional gas shipments would have significant implications for climate change. If all of the pipelines are built and run at full capacity, carbon dioxide emissions from burning this additional gas would be two and half times greater than the CO2 currently released from all U.S. coal-fired power plants, the report found.

This doesn’t include emissions of methane, a climate super pollutant and the primary component of natural gas. Methane emissions occur at every step of the natural gas supply chain—from wellheads and pipelines to LNG vessels and end users—as the gas leaks or is intentionally vented.

Methane emissions from the additional pipelines would pack a climate punch nearly twice that of CO2 emissions from coal-fired power plants over a 20-year period, according to the report.

The amount of gas leaks from the oil and gas sector will likely increase as the Trump administration rolls back the industry’s methane regulations, the report noted.

“We know from hundreds of thousands of aerial and satellite measurements that methane leaks from oil and gas production are far worse than we previously realized, which makes the climate footprint of natural gas as bad as coal in many regions of the country,” said Danny Richter, a senior fellow with CEEA and the report’s lead author. “We had a clear path to clean up the methane problem, including the methane emissions reduction program enacted by Congress in 2022 as well as EPA regulations for the oil and gas industry. But that pathway has been shut down by the current administration.”

A fee on excessive methane emissions from oil and gas producers implemented under the Biden administration was rescinded by the Trump administration on May 12.

“It is clear from the beginning of this ‘report’ that it was created with the outcome already determined and no desire to provide facts,” an EPA spokesperson told Inside Climate News. “U.S. methane emissions have been falling for decades thanks to American innovation, not heavy-handed government regulations, while domestic production of oil and gas has exponentially increased. According to EPA, methane emissions in the United States decreased by 19% between 1990 and 2022.”

Measurements in the field have repeatedly shown that reported methane emissions far understate actual releases.

The American Petroleum Institute, an oil and gas industry group, did not respond to a request for comment.

The report is based on U.S. Department of Energy data on 104 pipeline projects currently under development. It is unclear whether all of the planned pipelines will be built. Fifty-four of the projects, slightly more than half of all pipelines under development, have either not yet been approved or are on hold.

This includes one of the largest proposed pipelines, the $45 billion Alaska Nikiski LNG project. The pipe, which proponents have sought for decades, would transport gas 805 miles from Alaska’s North Slope to an LNG export terminal in southern Alaska. Completing the proposed export terminal, a retrofit of an existing import terminal, is included in the project’s projected cost.

The developer, the Alaska Gasline Development Corp, has applied for permits for the pipeline, many of which were approved during the last Trump administration, but still requires more.

President Donald Trump has directed agencies to speed up permitting and roll back environmental protections. He touted the Alaska Nikiski LNG project in an address to Congress earlier this year as “truly spectacular” and said “the permitting is gotten.”

Arvind Ravikumar, co-director of the Energy Emissions Modeling and Data Lab at the University of Texas at Austin, cautioned that the report included figures for carbon dioxide emissions of gas burned by end users in other countries that import the LNG.

“The way international carbon accounting works in this space is that you count only those emissions that happen within your national border,” Ravikumar said.

However, David Lyon, a senior methane scientist with the Environmental Defense Fund, said including emissions from burning the gas, wherever it occurs, made sense.

“Climate change is global,” Lyon said. “If we are just exporting our emissions to other countries, that’s still going to cause climate change and have impact.”

However, Lyon noted that in some cases, building gas pipelines could actually help reduce emissions. For example, in the Permian basin of West Texas and southeastern New Mexico—the largest oil and gas producing region in the country—gas is often flared, or vented, due to a lack of sufficient pipeline capacity.

In such cases, additional pipelines could help reduce flaring and its associated emissions. But it would be better to avoid drilling new wells in areas that lack sufficient pipeline capacity in the first place, Lyon added.

In comparing greenhouse gas emissions associated with the planned pipelines to those of coal-power plants, the report only compares CO2 emissions between the two fuel sources. Elsewhere, the report discusses methane emissions from the gas supply chain, but does not consider methane emissions from coal mines that feed coal-fired power plants. A recent peer-reviewed study comparing the greenhouse gas emissions of LNG and coal found methane emissions from coal mines were relatively modest compared to coal’s CO2 emissions.

In addition to permitting issues, economic forces could also limit the number of pipeline projects that get built in the coming years, or the extent to which completed pipelines operate at full capacity.

China, the world’s largest importer of LNG, stopped taking U.S. gas entirely in March in response to U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods.

Symons said the ongoing pipeline buildout could commit the U.S. to significantly larger LNG exports for decades to come.

“This locks in more fossil fuel dependency that future presidents won’t be able to make go away,” he said. “Policies like tax incentives come and go, but pipelines are forever.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-1485086044-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-06-02 06:02:32.014979

The bill, passed by House Congressional Republicans May 22, effectively kills several investment and production tax credits in the Inflation Reduction Act, former President Joe Biden’s signature climate law.

According to an analysis of information from various websites, including the Climate Investment Monitor, E2 and Weseley, almost 70 projects in the districts of Republican representatives from Virginia—worth $18.2 billion in investments and creating almost 11,000 jobs—have used those credits. The U.S. Congress Joint Economic Committee found 21,642 jobs in Virginia had been announced as a result of the IRA.

The One Big Beautiful Bill’s provisions would require projects seeking to use the tax credits to be under construction within 60 days of enactment of the legislation, and be producing electricity for the grid by 2028. Nuclear sources would still be given a timeline of needing to start construction by 2031 in order to receive a production tax credit.

It’s not immediately clear how the bill would impact all those projects in Virginia, since some of them are operating and under construction. But Mike Town, executive director of the Virginia League of Conservation Voters, asked rhetorically: “Will this bill, if passed by the Senate and signed into law, absolutely harm clean energy development and manufacturing across the country?”

His answer: “Yes. Unquestionably.”

But all, he believes, is not lost. Virginia has a clean energy policy, known as the Virginia Clean Economy Act, to transition to zero-carbon sources by midcentury, Town said, “and the clean energy industry existed before the IRA, and it will continue to exist afterwards.”

The One Big Beautiful Bill is the product of what Trump promised and Republicans have long lobbied for—repealing the IRA and cutting back other social services. But, noting goals to have affordable electricity for growing domestic needs, several House Republicans, including U.S. Rep. Jen Kiggans, who represents the Norfolk area, signed a March 9 letter supporting the preservation of IRA tax credits. Any modifications, they wrote, “risk sparking an energy crisis in our country, resulting in drastically higher power bills for American families.”

While the IRA spurred development of renewable energy around the country, Kiggans represents Virginia’s coastal area where Dominion Energy is constructing the nation’s largest offshore wind project, called Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, or CVOW. And, the state has spent more than a decade making the region an offshore wind manufacturing hub for the entire East Coast.

LS Greenlink, a Korean company manufacturing subsea cables to connect offshore wind electricity to the grid, is planning on using IRA production tax credits as part of its investment of $680 million in the region, creating jobs and receiving cheers from Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, a conservative Republican.

“It’s not free money, we have to earn it,” managing director Patrick Y. Shim told Inside Climate News during a groundbreaking in April. “It’s one of the reasons why we chose…the location.”

Kiggans still voted for the One Big Beautiful Bill, citing support for Trump’s 2017 tax cuts for the wealthy, but said in a statement she “remains deeply concerned about other shortsighted provisions.”

“We should be strengthening, not undermining, the clean energy tools that support our economy, power our military, and keep costs down for working families,” Kiggans said.

Conversely, several other congressional Republicans, including U.S. Rep Ben Cline from Virginia’s rural Shenandoah Valley, signed a letter seeking full repeal of the IRA tax credits, stating not doing so could “jeopardize” extension of Trump’s tax cuts “as well as the President’s other tax priorities.”

Despite tax credits in the IRA shoring up domestic supply chains, including manufacturing of modules for solar panels, Cline, who voted for the One Big Beautiful Bill, said in a statement that Biden’s law “promotes projects that increase our dependence on foreign supply chains.”

U.S. Rep. Rob Wittman, a Republican representing the Richmond suburbs, the Hampton Roads area and the so-called Northern Neck, pointed to an online statement and said “he continues to advocate for clean energy through his role as vice chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee,” according to a spokesperson (though the statement makes no specific mention of the investment tax credits). He, too, voted for the One Big Beautiful Bill.

Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill is now in the hands of the Republican-controlled Senate, and members of both sides of the aisle have indicated there could be substantial rewrites before going back to the House and then, Trump hopes, back to his desk for signing. In advance of the May 22 House vote, Virginia’s two Democratic Senators, Mark Warner and Tim Kaine, released a statement saying, “We must protect the investments that are creating jobs and lowering costs for Virginians.”

According to a state report released in 2024, Virginia received $36 billion in investment from data centers across 2022 and 2023, $24 billion of which being equipment and software that received sales-tax exemptions. And worldwide, the fossil fuel industry received $7 trillion, or 7.1 percent of GDP in 2022, in subsidies, according to the International Monetary Fund.

Virginia is at the forefront of surging energy demands from the proliferation of data centers. PJM Interconnection, the regional grid serving Virginia, projects summer demand to increase from over 185,000 megawatts across its territory to almost 225,000 megawatts, said Asim Z. Haque Sr., PJM’s senior vice president of governmental and member services, at a recent Virginia Commission on Electric Utility Regulation meeting.

At a time when more electricity generation is needed for the grid, the ones that are “ready to go, the vast majority of those projects are advanced energy. They are solar, they are wind, they are battery storage,” said Harry Godfrey, managing director of Advanced Energy United.

“The answer is unequivocal, if you pull back on these tax policies, it raises costs to consumers,” Godfrey said, referencing a Clean Energy Buyers Association analysis that found removing the tax credits provided under the IRA increases residential electricity costs in Virginia by 5.4 percent. “These are means of helping continueaccelerate the development,” of the clean energy that’s more affordable than fossil fuels, “and lower the costs to consumers.”

Solar and Storage Stalling Out?

Virginia is a net importer of electricity, meaning it relies on other states to generate power and deliver it through transmission lines to meet peak demand at times, which the weekend of June 22 last year reached 21,361 megawatts in Dominion’s service territory.

But given local pushback against solar and storage projects in Virginia, PJM permitting and supply chain issues, the One Big Beautiful Bill’s new timelines are a “big deal,” said Skyler Zunk, co-founder and CEO of Energy Right, a solar advocacy group rooted in conservative principles.

“This essentially would make them all have to go back and refinance completely. That’s essentially pulling the rug out from under very mature projects that have just not started construction,” said Zunk. “This is very important for AI, advanced computing, advanced transportation growth. This bill would be bigger and more beautiful if it truly kept the incentives in place to produce more electrons domestically.”

Zunk pointed to an Energix solar and storage project, and a Dominion Energy solar project, both in Brunswick County, that could generate 200 and 300 megawatts, respectively. The projects had been approved at the local level but still need a state permit, a cultural resource survey and a geotechnical analysis, meaning “it’s going to be probably a year or more before either of those start construction. Those two would be really affected.”

For those who want fossil fuel forms of energy production, natural gas turbines are experiencing years of delay from supply chain issues, energy developers have stated. And, small modular nuclear reactors aren’t likely to come online until the 2030s and may get hurt by the One Big Beautiful Bill wiping out a provision to allow the transferring, or purchasing, of tax credits to investors who want to wipe out their own tax liability, which allows smaller investors to take more risk on emerging technologies, Godfrey said.

The Virginia Clean Economy Act also has targets for Dominion Energy to build out 16,100 megawatts of solar and storage and wind generation technologies. The utility and Appalachian Power Company, which operates under American Electric Power Company and serves rural southwest Virginia, must acquire 100 percent carbon-free generation portfolios by 2050 through a mix of utility and privately-owned resources.

Dominion Energy did not respond to a request for comment, but in a regulatory filing detailed several IRA and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding mechanisms it has applied for while stating, “any incremental credit that the Company receives as a result of the IRA will be passed on to customers through lower project costs.”

Appalachian Power, which is facing rising energy bills and a dwindling customer base, said in a statement, “We are continuing to engage members of the Senate as they consider what has been proposed by the House.”

Offshore Wind on Track?

President Trump has been critical of offshore wind projects, but Virginia has been bullish on the technology since the creation of the Offshore Wind Development Board in 2010.

Gov. Youngkin has touted Dominion’s Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project as “on-time and on-budget,” when it cost $9.8 billion before any recent increases. CEO Bob Blue reiterated in an earnings call earlier this month that project, which would generate about 2.6 gigawatts of electricity, enough to power about 660,000 homes and avoid the emissions equivalent of about a million cars annually, said “let me be clear, CVOW remains one of the most affordable sources of energy for our customers.”

But Blue also shared that Trump’s tariffs, if continued through 2026 when the project is expected to fully come online, would have a “cumulative tariff impact” of “approximately $500 million.”

Following a $900 million increase earlier this year from PJM interconnection costs and actual tariff costs accrued so far and projected through the end of June this year, the project’s cost has risen to $10.8 billion. Because of a settlement agreement between the company and environmental and ratepayer advocates to ensure protections for any shortfalls in electricity production and cost overruns, 50 percent of the cost increase will be borne by ratepayers.

Dominion initially sought in November to recover $11.23 a month from a residential customer using 1,000 kilowatt hours for CVOW costs before customers could begin receiving credits from the project in later years after it comes online. The costs include a 9.35 percent and 9.7 percent profit margins for the last rate period and the current one, respectively. But the PJM and tariff costs increases for the project equate to an additional about $0.48 monthly increase for those residential customers.

“It is worth noting CVOW was not an IRA project; it was in the pipeline well before the IRA was passed. We felt it made economic sense without that,” Bill Murray, Dominion senior vice president of corporate affairs and communications, said during the Virginia commission meeting. The production tax credits, he added, “certainly help mitigate customer costs…but our read of what passed the U.S. House…is that the CVOW project itself would not be affected.”

Manufacturing Halted?

Farther southwest in the deep red districts of Griffith and McGuire, jobs are hard to come by.

The region, largely beholden to coal, has made efforts to use federal government Abandoned Mine Land Economic Revitalization funds, which sought another round of applications in March for $11 million.

But manufacturing jobs are increasing, including Microporous, a battery manufacturer that announced a $1.3 billion investment for a facility in Pittsylvania County, which has benefited from the IRA tax credits.

There’s also Volvo Trucks North America employing 36,000 people at a plant in Dublin, which has benefited from Commercial Clean Vehicle Credits reducing the costs of electric heavy trucks. The two companies did not respond to a request for comment on the One Big Beautiful Bill.

A press secretary for Youngkin, who cheered the Micorporous announcement, declined to address how loss of the credits could impact the company’s operations and instead cheered the work of Trump Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Department of Interior Secretary Doug Burgum for “unleashing safe, secure, and reliable American energy and power,” without mentioning the word clean.

Peter Finocchio,Yougkin’s spokesperson, also touted the Trump administration and Virginia’s efforts on nuclear, including what could be the first nuclear fusion plant in the world and “several active Small Modular Reactor projects in the works.” Called SMR’s for short, small modular reactors can produce 300 megawatts of electricity and are being looked at as a way to provide carbon-free 24/7 baseload power, though critics question if the technology can be affordable.

Godfrey, with Advanced Energy United, wondered what losing the clean energy purchasing credits may do to the Volvo plant’s sales.

“I think it’s really important for policy makers to take into account the impact of pulling back on some of those demand-side drivers in the form of tax credits like for clean commercial vehicles,” said Godfrey. “I don’t know whether folks in the ninth district are driving those vehicles, but I know they’re making them. If we undercut the clean commercial vehicles incentive, does that continue? I don’t know.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/solar-1-1024x576.jpg,N,,2025-06-02 06:02:35.349025

The decision affects 24 projects across sectors like advanced materials, industrial decarbonisation and chemical manufacturing. Recipients range from giants like Exxon Mobil and Kraft Heinz to startups like Skyven, Brimstone and Sublime Systems.

Brimstone Energy, also working on low-carbon cement and alumina production, responded with cautious optimism. The startup emphasised its alignment with national priorities, particularly around boosting domestic critical mineral output.

“Given our project’s strong alignment with President Trump’s priority to increase US production of critical minerals, we believe this was a misunderstanding,” Brimstone spokesperson Liza Darwin stated to TechCrunch.

She added, “As the first US-based alumina plant in a generation, our project, which would also make portland cement, would clear a ‘mine-to-metal’ path for US aluminium production, fortifying the U.S. critical mineral supply chain and creating thousands of jobs.”

Under the Trump administration, Energy Secretary Chris Wrights labelled the move “due diligence.” While specific project cancellations weren’t explained, a May 15 memo hints at expanded audit powers being used to justify the cuts.

With funding pulled, the future of these clean energy initiatives is uncertain, stalling innovation efforts aimed at reducing industrial emissions and modernising US manufacturing.

The sudden announcement has taken several recipients by surprise. Sublime Systems, a startup developing low-carbon cement, voiced its disappointment over the DOE’s decision.

“Sublime was surprised and disappointed to receive the news about the termination of our Industrial Demonstrations Program award, given the clear progress we’ve made in scaling our American-invented technology, partnering with some of the Western World’s largest cement producers, and generating a bankable customer base,” spokesperson Rob Kreis told TechCrunch via email. The company is now assessing its path forward.

“Sen. Tillis wants to make sure nothing in the bill impedes jobs or growth,” said Daniel Keylin, Tillis’ senior adviser. “It’s not necessarily about keeping those credits, but it’s about providing those businesses with a soft landing.”

Sen. Ted Budd, a Republican from Davie County, hasn’t spoken publicly about the bill. He’s a staunch supporter of Trump’s and doesn’t often push back on Republican legislation.

The Hill reported Budd was among senators who met with Senate Majority Leader John Thune and Senate Finance Committee Chairman Mike Crapo about Medicaid cuts and what they would mean for rural communities.

His staff did not return a request for comment Friday afternoon about any concerns Budd might have about the bill.

Trump asked the Senate to get the bill passed as soon as possible.

By unwinding these tax credits in such a ramshackle and disorganized way, Republicans would undermine many of their own goals.
For the first time in decades, American electricity demand is soaring, driven by electric vehicles, data centers and manufacturing.
If the Senate follows the House and cuts off the clean-electricity tax credits, it will hurt these next-generation technologies most.
Senate Republicans understand that energy abundance is the essential input for the economy, national security and America’s well-being.","Every so often, Americans rely on the Senate to save us from the more ill-considered urges of the House of Representatives. That time has come again. House Republicans have sent an abysmal reconciliation bill to the Senate that would wreak particular havoc on the country’s energy policy and undermine America’s industrial strength. But the Senate can fix it.

The bill would gut the clean-energy tax credits established in the Inflation Reduction Act to fund tax cuts that would largely benefit high-earning households. The energy tax credits, which were passed under President Joe Biden in 2022, were meant to increase the country’s electricity supply, reinvigorate its battery and electric vehicle supply chains and cut its carbon pollution. They have helped drive a clean-energy manufacturing boom across the country.

I think Republicans are making a mistake by trying to repeal much of the Inflation Reduction Act, though I understand why they’ve been frustrated with Democrats’ sometimes contradictory energy policy. Too often, state and local progressives have called for climate action, but then fought off, shut down or lamented the energy sources — especially hydroelectricity and nuclear power — that until recently generated the bulk of America’s clean electricity.

But Republicans are now the ones pursuing a nonsensical energy strategy. The Inflation Reduction Act improved on decades of failed policy by going technology-neutral — its tax credits support any new power plant that doesn’t generate greenhouse gas emissions. That means technologies that Republicans like, including nuclear fission, geothermal power and even nuclear fusion, could benefit.

By unwinding these tax credits in such a ramshackle and disorganized way, Republicans would undermine many of their own goals. Senate Republicans can still salvage a sensible energy policy from the House’s mad dash.

First, they should preserve tax credits that support innovation and recognize the fact that the United States is currently seeding the next generation of world-leading energy technologies.

Take the new class of nuclear startups that are finally ready to deploy their first power plants. Or the entrepreneurs who have figured out how to use fracking equipmentto deliver cheap, zero-carbon electricity by drilling new geothermal wells. Fervo Energy, one of these geothermal startups, has shown that its drilling tiunes are falling, suggesting that its technology can rapidly take off in the same way that fracking, solar and batteries have. There’s even been recent encouraging news on the nuclear fusion front.

These and other clean-energy developments are the reason there’s the potential for a boom in U.S. electricity. For the first time in decades, American electricity demand is soaring, driven by electric vehicles, data centers and manufacturing.

Without a burst of new supply on the market, this demand will drive up power prices. Low electricity costs have long been a strength of American economic competitiveness that we are now at risk of losing.

Like with any new technology, these next-generation American nuclear and geothermal power plants will be hard to plan and hard to finance. That’s why the government should give them a leg up — much like it once helped the solar, wind and fracking industries — with tax incentives that support early projects. But the G.O.P. reconciliation bill would will make this impossible.

If the Senate follows the House and cuts off the clean-electricity tax credits, it will hurt these next-generation technologies most. Nuclear and geothermal developers in the first stages of building cannot rush their early projects to completion. Even if the Senate adopts the House’s provision to allow nuclear plants to use the tax credits until 2028, it will still not be enough — the procedural hurdles will prevent banks from financing nuclear plants. The Senate should give nuclear and geothermal developers the same long-term certainty it once extended to solar and wind developers.

Second, Republican senators should pay particular attention to the risk of a coming electricity and energy price shock. Today, natural gas provides about a third of America’s primary energy, and it is the country’s No. 1 source of electricity generation. But the country’s gas supply is about to come under more pressure. From 2024 to 2028, 10 new liquified natural gas terminals are expected to open across North America, which would roughly double the United States’ export capacity of the fuel. This would, in turn, increase demand for domestic natural gas supplies.

It’s possible that energy companies would respond to this higher demand by drilling for more gas. But if natural gas supply doesn’t rise as fast as demand, then U.S. natural gas prices will rise to something closer to their global average. Natural gas is three to five times more expensive in Europe than in the United States, so there’s a real chance that American consumers will get soaked.

A monster price shock could also hurt American manufacturers and hold back the artificial intelligence industry. This scenario would worsen if new renewable-energy or zero-carbon power plants — which had been planned under the assumption the tax credits would stay on the books — get canceled.

Finally, Republican senators should be careful not to pull the rug out from under electric vehicle factories that have set up shop in their states. Over the past few months, Republicans have seemed dead set on ditching any policies that help support demand for E.V.s — whether they do so through subsidies, such as the $7,500 tax credit for personal E.V. buyers, or through regulations such as California’s 2035 E.V. rules. At the same time, they have mostly left the supply-side subsidies for E.V. and battery manufacturing in place, although they have still made them harder to access.

But Princeton University’s energy modeling shows that yanking away these supports would ultimately kill the economic case for the hundreds of new E.V. and battery factories under construction nationwide. That’s because the demand- and supply-side incentives are designed to work together. By killing the personal E.V. tax credit, lawmakers would also kill demand for the creation of a domestic critical mineral supply chain — even though reshoring mineral production is a Trump administration goal.

So far, batteries have been this century’s essential energy technology. They will be core to the most important industries of the future in information technology, transportation and warfare. Just look at how battery-powered drones have transformed the Ukraine war. American policymakers would be foolish to give up on the industry for essentially ideological reasons. There is plenty of room to improve America’s battery policy — we should ensure that next-generation batteries are developed and made here — but simply surrendering current technology is misguided.

President Trump understands the importance of cheap electricity. During his Inaugural Address, he bragged that the United States can flex its manufacturing muscles because energy is so much cheaper here than elsewhere. Now his policies risk making energy much more expensive while surrendering any leadership in energy technology whatsoever. It is time for senators to act responsibly — to set a long-term strategy for the country’s energy future. Senate Republicans understand that energy abundance is the essential input for the economy, national security and America’s well-being. Now they must act — and save us from the idiocy that would otherwise result.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/02/opinion/02meyer/02meyer-facebookJumbo-v5.jpg,N,,2025-06-02 06:03:09.976493

Searching for the word “climate” produces more than 300 research projects that were set to receive more than $230 million.
In April, the university sued the Trump administration over cuts to its research funding and efforts to exert control over its admissions and governance policies.
“We need people from all parts of society who are trained in geoscience and climate science to address all these global challenges that we are facing,” she says.","The Trump administration has terminated National Science Foundation grants for more than 100 research projects related to climate change amid a widening campaign to slash federal funding for scientists and institutions studying the rising risks of a warming world.

The move will cut off what’s likely to amount to tens of millions of dollars for studies that were previously approved and, in most cases, already in the works.

Affected projects include efforts to develop cleaner fuels, measure methane emissions, improve understanding of how heat waves and sea-level rise disproportionately harm marginalized groups, and help communities transition to sustainable energy, according to an MIT Technology Review review of a GrantWatch database—a volunteer-led effort to track federal cuts to research—and a list of terminated grants from the National Science Foundation (NSF) itself.

The NSF is one of the largest sources of US funding for university research, so the cancellations will deliver a big blow to climate science and clean-energy development.

They come on top of the White House’s broader efforts to cut research funding and revenue for universities and significantly raise their taxes. The administration has also strived to slash staff and budgets at federal research agencies, halt efforts to assess the physical and financial risks of climate change, and shut down labs that have monitored and analyzed the levels of greenhouse gases in the air for decades.

“I don’t think it takes a lot of imagination to understand where this is going,” says Daniel Schrag, co-director of the science, technology, and public policy program at Harvard University, which has seen greater funding cuts than any other university amid an escalating legal conflict with the administration. “I believe the Trump administration intends to zero out funding for climate science altogether.”

The NSF says it’s terminating grants that aren’t aligned with the agency’s program goals, “including but not limited to those on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), environmental justice, and misinformation/disinformation.”

Trump administration officials have argued that DEI considerations have contaminated US science, favoring certain groups over others and undermining the public’s trust in researchers.

“Political biases have displaced the vital search for truth,” Michael Kratsios, head of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, said to a group of NSF administrations and others last month, according to reporting in Science.

Science v. politics

But research projects that got caught in the administration’s anti-DEI filter aren’t the only casualties of the cuts. The NSF has also canceled funding for work that has little obvious connections to DEI ambitions, such as research on catalysts.

Many believe the administration’s broader motivation is to undermine the power of the university system and prevent research findings that cut against its politics.

Trump and his officials have repeatedly argued, in public statements and executive orders, that climate fears are overblown and that burdensome environmental regulations have undermined the nation’s energy security and economic growth.

“It certainly seems like a deliberate attempt to undo any science that contradicts the administration,” says Alexa Fredston, an assistant professor of ocean sciences at the University of California, Santa Cruz.

On May 28, a group of states including California, New York, and Illinois sued the NSF, arguing that the cuts illegally violated diversity goals and funding priorities clearly established by Congress, which controls federal spending.

A group of universities also filed a lawsuit against the NSF over its earlier decision to reduce the indirect cost rate for research, which reimburses universities for overhead expenses associated with work carried out on campuses. The plaintiffs included the California Institute of Technology, Carnegie Mellon University, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which has also lost a number of research grants.

(MIT Technology Review is owned by, but editorially independent from, MIT.)

The NSF declined to comment.

‘Theft from the American people’

GrantWatch is an effort among researchers at rOpenSci, Harvard, and other organizations to track terminations of grants issued by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and NSF. It draws on voluntary submissions from scientists involved as well as public government information.

A search of its database for the terms “climate change,” “clean energy,” “climate adaptation,” “environmental justice,” and “climate justice” showed that the NSF has canceled funds for 118 projects, which were supposed to receive more than $100 million in total. Searching for the word “climate” produces more than 300 research projects that were set to receive more than $230 million. (That word often indicates climate-change-related research, but in some abstracts it refers to the cultural climate.)

Some share of those funds has already been issued to research groups. The NSF section of the database doesn’t include that “outlaid” figure, but it’s generally about half the amount of the original grants, according to Noam Ross, a computational researcher and executive director of rOpenSci, a nonprofit initiative that promotes open and reproducible science.

A search for “climate change” among the NIH projects produces another 22 studies that were terminated and were still owed nearly $50 million in grants. Many of those projects explored the mental or physical health effects of climate change and extreme weather events.

The NSF more recently released its own list of terminated projects, which mostly mirrored GrantWatch’s findings and confirms the specific terminations mentioned in this story.

“These grant terminations are theft from the American people,” Ross said in an email response. “By illegally ending this research the Trump administration is wasting taxpayer dollars, gutting US leadership in science, and telling the world that the US government breaks its promises.”

Havard, the country’s oldest university, has been particularly hard hit.

In April, the university sued the Trump administration over cuts to its research funding and efforts to exert control over its admissions and governance policies. The White House, in turn, has moved to eliminate all federal funds for the university, including hundreds of NSF and NIH grants.

Daniel Nocera, a professor at Harvard who has done pioneering work on so-called artificial photosynthesis, a pathway for producing clean fuels from sunlight, said in an email that all of his grants were terminated.

“I have no research funds,” he added.

Another terminated grant involved a collaboration between Harvard and the NSF National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), designed to update the atmospheric chemistry component of the Community Earth System Model, an open-source climate model widely used by scientists around the world.

The research was expected to “contribute to a better understanding of atmospheric chemistry in the climate system and to improve air quality predictions within the context of climate change,” according to the NSF abstract.

“We completed most of the work and were able to bring it to a stopping point,” Daniel Jacob, a professor at Harvard listed as the principal investigator on the project, said in an email. “But it will affect the ability to study chemistry-climate interactions. And it is clearly not right to pull funding from an existing project.”

Plenty of the affected research projects do, in one way or another, grapple with issues of diversity, equity, and inclusion. But that’s because there is ample evidence that disadvantaged communities experience higher rates of illness from energy-sector pollution, will be harder hit by the escalating effects of extreme weather and are underrepresented in scientific fields.

One of the largest terminations cut off about $4 million dollars of remaining funds for the CLIMATE Justice Initiative, a fellowship program at the University of California, Irvine designed to recruit, train and mentor a more diverse array of researchers in Earth sciences.

The NSF decision occurred halfway into the 5-year program, halting funds for a number of fellows who were in the midst of environmental justice research efforts with community partners in Southern California. Kathleen Johnson, a professor at UC Irvine and director of the initiative, says the university is striving to find ways to fund as many participants as possible for the remainder of their fellowships.

“We need people from all parts of society who are trained in geoscience and climate science to address all these global challenges that we are facing,” she says. “The people who will be best positioned to do this work … are the people who understand the community's needs and are able to therefore work to implement equitable solutions.”

“Diverse teams have been shown to do better science,” Johnson adds.

Numerous researchers whose grants were terminated didn’t respond to inquiries from MIT Technology Review or declined to comment, amid growing concerns that the Trump administration will punish scientists or institutions that criticize their policies.

Coming cuts

The termination of existing NSF and NIH grants is just the start of the administration’s plans to cut federal funding for climate and clean-energy research.

The White House’s budget proposal for the coming fiscal year seeks to eliminate tens of billions of dollars in funding across federal agencies, specifically calling out “Green New Scam funds” at the Department of Energy; “low-priority climate monitoring satellites” at NASA; “climate-dominated research, data, and grant programs” at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration; and “climate; clean energy; woke social, behavioral, and economic sciences” at the NSF.

The administration released a more detailed NSF budget proposal on May 30th, which called for a 60% reduction in research spending and nearly zeroed out the clean energy technology program. It also proposed cutting funds by 97% for the US Global Change Research Program, which produces regular assessments of climate risks; 80% for the Ocean Observatories Initiative, a global network of ocean sensors that monitor shifting marine conditions; and 40% for NCAR, the atmospheric research center.

If Congress approves budget reductions anywhere near the levels the administration has put forward, scientists fear, it could eliminate the resources necessary to carry on long-running climate observation of oceans, forests, and the atmosphere.

The administration also reportedly plans to end the leases on dozens of NOAA facilities, including the Global Monitoring Laboratory in Hilo, Hawaii. The lab supports the work of the nearby Mauna Loa Observatory, which has tracked atmospheric carbon dioxide levels for decades.

Even short gaps in these time-series studies, which scientists around the world rely upon, would have an enduring impact on researchers’ ability to analyze and understand weather and climate trends.

“We won’t know where we’re going if we stop measuring what’s happening,” says Jane Long, formerly the associate director of energy and environment at Lawrence Livermore National Lab. “It’s devastating—there’s no two ways around it.”

Stunting science

Growing fears that public research funding will take an even larger hit in the coming fiscal year are forcing scientists to rethink their research plans—or to reconsider whether they want to stay in the field at all, numerous observers said.

“The amount of funding we’re talking about isn’t something a university can fill indefinitely, and it’s not something that private philanthropy can fill for very long,” says Michael Oppenheimer, a professor of geosciences and international affairs at Princeton University. “So what we’re talking about is potentially cataclysmic for climate science.”

“Basically it’s a shit show,” he adds, “and how bad a shit show it is will depend a lot on what happens in the courts and Congress over the next few months.”

One climate scientist, who declined to speak on the record out of concern that the administration might punish his institution, said the declining funding is forcing researchers to shrink their scientific ambitions down to a question of “What can I do with my laptop and existing data sets?”

“If your goal was to make the United States a second-class or third-class country when it comes to science and education, you would be doing exactly what the administration is doing,” the scientist said. “People are pretty depressed, upset, and afraid.”

Given the rising challenges, Harvard’s Schrag fears that the best young climate scientists will decide to shift their careers outside of the US, or move into high tech or other fields where they can make significantly more money.

“We might lose a generation of talent—and that’s not going to get fixed four years from now,” he says. “The irony is that Trump is attacking the institutions and foundation of US science that literally made America great.”","https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/research-cuts.jpg?resize=1200,600",N,,2025-06-02 06:03:50.136964

They can build out charging infrastructure, provide tax incentives and subsidies, and favor electric vehicles in parking and carpool lanes.
Technology will continue to advance, with or without the California mandate, concludes Professor Carlson.","The march toward electric cars in the United States took a U-turn in May when the Senate voted to revoke California’s electric vehicle mandate. And it’s not just about California. The move also applies to nearly a dozen states in step with the Golden State’s zero-emissions requirement, set to start phasing in next year.

President Trump has promised to sign the congressional action into law. And as soon as he does, California says, it will sue.

Regardless of the outcome, the revocation is a significant rebuke to states’ self-determination and, more specifically, any state hoping to push the nation to quickly abandon fossil fuels in favor of electrification for vehicles. The scientific consensus says greenhouse gas emissions must be cut dramatically within the next five years to mitigate the worst effects of climate change.

Why We Wrote This

The drive for electric vehicles, in California and beyond, is challenging carmakers to adapt faster than many deem possible or profitable. The Trump administration is pushing back by testing the limits of state governance.

“It will slow down adoption,” says Stephanie Valdez Streaty, of Cox Automotive Inc., a technology provider to the industry.

Here, the Monitor explains why California plays such an outsize role in auto emissions standards, why this has met strenuous pushback, and where things might go from here.

Why is California so important when it comes to auto emissions?

Because California’s smog is so bad, the federal government has, for more than 50 years, allowed the state to set its own emissions limits, resulting in more efficient vehicles and the nation’s most aggressive push toward electric vehicles. Other smoggy states have followed suit. But each new standard or rule requires approval from the Environmental Protection Agency, which has accepted all of the exceptions. Now Congress is saying “no,” not this time. Not for an EV mandate.

Back in the 1960s and 1970s, Los Angeles’ air was so polluted that some folks wore gas masks. Schools regularly sent kids home because of thick smog. You frequently couldn’t see the iconic Hollywood sign.

Vehicles were the main culprit, as was the area’s geography and climate. LA sits in a basin and gets lots of sunshine. When sunlight mixes with tailpipe emissions, it makes dangerous ozone. Smog in the basin has drastically improved, but as of 2020, more than 150 days exceeded the most recent federal ozone standards. Heavy truck traffic has also contributed to terrible pollution in California’s Central Valley. The EPA is considering fining Southern California for failing to meet federal air quality standards.

California’s influence is also due to its size. As the nation’s most populous state, it has the largest auto market. If California were a country, it would be the world’s fourth-largest economy. So when California sets new emission standards – and other states follow – the auto industry is compelled to adopt them.

As a result, the state has frequently exercised that power, driving changes in the nation’s standards and technology, including the adoption of catalytic converters. “California’s ambitious goals are what pushes the industry,” says Ann Carlson, who teaches law at the University of California, Los Angeles, and who helped write tailpipe emission policies for the Biden administration.

Why are Congress, the president, and the U.S. auto industry all pushing back on EVs?

Many people feel that California’s zero-emissions standard is moving toward an EV switchover too fast, and forcing that change on the nation. Climate change politics, too, play a role.

Beginning next year, the California mandate will call for 35% of the state’s new vehicle sales to be zero-emission or plug-in hybrid. That proportion is scheduled to rise to 100% by 2035. Other state rules that relate to medium- and heavy-duty truck sales and engine standards were also revoked by Congress and await the president’s signature.

“Democrats have this delusional dream of eliminating gas-powered vehicles in America,” Republican Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming said on the Senate floor in May. “They want to force-feed electric vehicles to every man and woman who drives in this country.”

California leads the nation in zero-emission sales and EV infrastructure, with more than 1.25 million electric vehicle registrations and more than 52,000 public charging ports.

But California is behind in meeting its own mandate timetable – so far, EVs are 23% of all sales this year. And the congressional pushback was bipartisan in the House, where 35 Democrats supported the rollback of the mandate, including two from California. The Senate vote fell almost entirely along party lines.

Consumers have concerns about insufficient and unreliable charging stations, battery range and quality, and high prices for EVs. The sense among manufacturers and auto dealers is that “the market isn’t ready for these aggressive goals,” says Ms. Valdez Streaty. Automakers want guidelines for all states, not just some of them, she says.

What’s the outlook for EVs – and California’s role?

First, we’re heading into legal wrangling. Both the Senate parliamentarian and the independent U.S. Government Accountability Office said that the procedure used to block the California waivers was not allowed. That will be one thing California will argue when it sues to keep the mandate.

Republicans are also likely to cut federal infrastructure funds for charging stations and tax credits for purchasing electric vehicles. In April, EV sales took a hit after record sales in the first quarter, according to Cox Automotive. And then there’s the uncertainty around tariffs.

“It’s going to be a bumpy ride this year” for EVs, says Ms. Valdez Streaty, who expects more sales of gas and plug-in hybrids as transitional vehicles. At the same time, new all-electric models are being introduced, and battery range is improving, now averaging around 300 miles per charge.

“Long term, we’re still going to continue towards electrification, but the timeline to get there is going to shift and slow down,” says Ms. Valdez Streaty.

California’s political leaders say revoking the mandate will be expensive. According to the California Air Resources Board, which crafted the mandate, adhering to it would result in 1,287 fewer air-quality-related deaths, 1,110 fewer hospital and emergency visits, and $13 billion in public health benefits. It would also reduce greenhouse gas emissions by nearly 400 million metric tons – the equivalent of 100 coal-fired power plants’ annual output.

The nation, too, will pay a price in global competition, particularly with China, which is on a tear with lower-cost electric vehicles.

“We won’t stand by as Trump Republicans make America smoggy again — undoing work that goes back to the days of Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan — all while ceding our economic future to China,” said California’s Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, in a statement.

It’s possible to see state authority restored, says Professor Carlson at UCLA. But California and other states “still have a lot of their own authority to try to stimulate electric vehicle demand and supply,” she says. They can build out charging infrastructure, provide tax incentives and subsidies, and favor electric vehicles in parking and carpool lanes. And they can work together, as they plan to in the recently announced 11-state Affordable Clean Cars Coalition.

Technology will continue to advance, with or without the California mandate, concludes Professor Carlson. The world, she adds, is moving in that direction.",https://images.csmonitor.com/csm/2025/05/0530%20NCALEV%20charger%20lede.jpg?alias=standard_900x600,N,,2025-06-02 09:11:03.577701

Combining these resources can create a reliable energy supply tailored to the unique demands of data centers.

But, for Ohio’s rural communities, this isn’t just a challenge. It’s also an opportunity.

As data centers pull a massive amount of energy from the grid, Ohio is pioneering an innovative solution: building “microgrids” at data center sites. Microgrids are small, self-sufficient energy systems that can run independently from the main electrical grid. They generate and store energy onsite using sources including natural gas and renewables. This approach prevents data centers from overwhelming the broader grid during periods of high demand, making the whole grid more resilient.

Ohio is uniquely positioned to scale up microgrid technology. Our state sits atop abundant natural gas reserves, including the Utica and Marcellus shale formations, providing a stable, low-cost fuel source. Ohio’s growing renewable energy sector offers further flexibility for powering microgrids in a sustainable way. Combining these resources can create a reliable energy supply tailored to the unique demands of data centers. Developing these microgrids also offers an economic opportunity, including good-paying jobs in construction, engineering, energy management, and data infrastructure.

But there’s another critical — and unexpected — benefit to integrating microgrids with data centers: growing healthy, fresh food year-round.

Data centers produce substantial heat and carbon dioxide — byproducts typically viewed as waste. Yet, these resources can be repurposed effectively through controlled-environment agriculture, turning them into powerful growth accelerators for local crops. The idea is simple: excess heat from data center operations can warm greenhouses, while carbon dioxide emissions can boost plant growth, creating ideal conditions for high-quality produce.

Imagine Ohio-grown strawberries, lettuce, and tomatoes harvested freshly in January and February, when there’s still deep snow on the ground, powered sustainably by waste heat from AI-driven computing facilities. This approach drastically reduces transportation emissions, minimizes food spoilage, and lessens dependence on distant agricultural markets.

As a sixth-generation Ohio farmer who has also spent years in energy and technology, I see exciting synergies emerging in how we grow our food and power our economy. New innovations now allow us to transform what was previously considered waste and pollution into productive resources. For Ohio farmers, creatively utilizing waste isn’t a novel concept. We’ve always turned animal waste into nutrient-rich fertilizer and crop residues into sustainable soil amendments.

Our state needs a plan to proactively seize opportunities with the growth of data infrastructure and AI — including the use of local energy, the maximization of local job creation, and other less obvious prospects like the expansion of year-round produce options. This should be a team effort: local and state governments, business leaders, foundations, the tech sector, farmers, and others all have a role to play.

If we fail to strategically plan the growth of data centers in Ohio, we risk higher energy costs and compromised grid reliability without generating meaningful job creation or community benefits. Likewise, if we fail to invest in local, sustainable, healthy food, we risk worsening a crisis of poor nutrition and chronic disease.

Ohio should show the world how to address both challenges at the same time.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-94/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/gettyimages-982423716-1024x6831748853239.jpg?h=199d8c1f&itok=RE9aFAYD,N,,2025-06-02 10:03:23.163731

Thomasville, Georgia, has a water problem. Its treatment system is far out of date, posing serious health and environmental risks.

“We have wastewater infrastructure that is old,” said Sheryl Sealy, the assistant city manager for this city of 18,881 near the Florida border, about 45 minutes from Tallahassee. “It’s critical that we do the work to replace this.”

But it’s expensive to replace. The system is especially bad in underserved parts of the city, Sealy said.

In September, Thomasville applied to get some help from the federal government, and just under four months later, the city and its partners were awarded a nearly $20 million Community Change grant from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to make the long-overdue wastewater improvements, build a resilience hub and health clinic, and upgrade homes in several historic neighborhoods.

“The grant itself was really a godsend for us,” Sealy said.

In early April, as the EPA canceled grants for similar projects across the country, federal officials assured Thomasville that their funding was on track. Then on May 1, the city received a termination notice.

“We felt, you know, a little taken off guard when the bottom did let out for us,” said Sealy.

Thomasville isn’t alone.

Under the Trump administration, the EPA has canceled or interrupted hundreds of grants aimed at improving health and severe weather preparedness because the agency “determined that the grant applications no longer support administration priorities,” according to an emailed statement to Grist.

The cuts are part of a broader gutting of federal programs aimed at furthering environmental justice, an umbrella term for the effort to help communities that have been hardest hit by pollution and other environmental issues, which often include low-income communities and communities of color.

In Thomasville’s case, the city has a history of heavy industry that has led to poor air quality. Air pollution, health concerns, and high poverty qualified the surrounding county for the Biden administration’s Justice40 initiative, which prioritized funding for disadvantaged communities. Thomasville has some of the highest exposure risks in Georgia to toxic air pollutants that can cause respiratory, reproductive, and developmental health problems, according to the Environmental Defense Fund’s Climate Vulnerability Index. The city’s wastewater woes don’t only mean the potential for sewage backups in homes and spills into local waterways but also the risk of upper respiratory problems, according to Zealan Hoover, a former Biden administration EPA official who is now advising the advocacy groups Environmental Protection Network and Lawyers for Good Government.

“These projects were selected because they have a really clear path to alleviating the health challenges facing this community,” he said.

Critics argue there’s a disconnect between the Trump administration’s attack on the concept of environmental justice and the realities of what the funds are paying for.

“What is it about building a new health clinic and upgrading wastewater infrastructure … that’s inconsistent with administration policy?” Democratic Georgia Senator Jon Ossoff asked EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin at a recent hearing.

Zeldin repeatedly responded by discussing the agency’s review process intended to comply with President Donald Trump’s executive orders, particularly those related to diversity, equity, and inclusion policies, but Ossoff cut him off, pushing for a specific answer about Thomasville’s grant. “Is a new health clinic for Thomasville, Georgia, woke?” he asked.

Thomasville’s Sealy said she understands that the federal government has to make hard funding decisions — that’s true locally too — but losing this grant has left her city in the lurch. In addition to the planned work on the wastewater collection system, the city needs to update its treatment plant to meet EPA standards. That overhaul will likely cost $60 million to $70 million, she said.

“How do you fund that?” Sealy asked. “You can’t fund that on the backs of the people who pay our rates.”

The funding cuts have left cities across Georgia — including Athens, Norcross, and Savannah — as well as nonprofit groups, in a state of uncertainty: some grants terminated, some suspended then reinstated, some still unclear. This puts city officials in an impossible position, unable to wait or to move forward, according to Athens-Clarke County Sustainability Director Mike Wharton.

“Do you commit to new programs? Do you commit to services?” he said. “Here you are sitting in limbo for months.”

Like Thomasville, Athens was also awarded a nearly $20 million Community Change grant. The city was going to use the money for backup generators, solar power, and battery storage at its public safety complex — ensuring 911, police, the jail, a domestic violence shelter, and other services could all operate during a power outage. That grant has been terminated.

The problem, Wharton said, goes beyond that money not coming in; the city had already spent time, resources, and money to get the grant.

“We spent $60,000 in local funding hiring people to write the grants,” he said. “Over a period of 14 months we invested over 700 hours of local personnel time. So we diverted our services to focus on these things.”

These frustrations are playing out for grant recipients throughout the state and country, according to Hoover. He said it’s not just confusing — it’s expensive.

“They are causing project costs to skyrocket because they keep freezing and unfreezing and refreezing projects,” he said. “One of the big drivers of cost overruns in any infrastructure project, public or private, is having to demobilize and remobilize your teams.”

Thomasville and Athens officials both said they’re appealing their grant terminations, which require them to submit a formal letter outlining the reasons for their appeal and requesting the agency reconsider the decision. They’re also reaching out to their elected officials, hoping that pressure from their senators and members of Congress can get them the federal money they were promised.

Other cities and nonprofits, as well as a group of Democratic state attorneys general, have sued, arguing that terminating their grants without following proper procedures is illegal. But that’s a difficult step for many localities to take.

“Suing the federal government to assert your legal rights is very daunting, even if the law is on your side,” Hoover said.",https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/wastewater-2.jpg?quality=75&strip=all,N,,2025-06-02 06:03:55.054504

China produces 90 percent of the world’s nearly 200,000 tons a year of high-performance rare earth magnets.

China refines over 99 percent of the world’s supply of so-called heavy rare earths, which are the least common kinds of rare earths.
Only in recent months has the mine become able to chemically separate the rare earths in more than half its output.","Two decades ago, factories in Indiana that turned rare earth metals into magnets moved production to China — just as demand for the magnets was starting to soar for everything from cars and semiconductors to fighter jets and robots.

The United States is now reckoning with the cost of losing that supply chain. The Chinese government abruptly halted exports of rare earth magnets to any country on April 4 as part of its trade war with the United States.

American officials had expected that China would relax its restrictions on the magnets as part of the trade truce the two countries reached in mid-May. But on Friday, President Trump suggested that China had continued to limit access.

Now, American and European companies are running out of the magnets.

American automakers are the hardest hit, with executives warning that production at factories across the Midwest and South could be cut back in the coming days and weeks. Carmakers need the magnets for the electric motors that run brakes, steering and fuel injectors. The motors in a single luxury car seat, for example, use as many as 12 magnets.

The Chinese government has said little lately about its rare earth export restrictions. Kevin Hassett, the director of the White House National Economic Council, said on ABC’s “This Week” on Sunday that Mr. Trump and China’s leader, Xi Jinping, could speak about trade as soon as this week, though no date had been set.

After China stopped all exports, it said that future shipments would require separate export licenses. China’s Ministry of Commerce has struggled since then to issue licenses. It gave a handful to European companies in mid-April and a few more for American companies last week, but world supplies are dwindling fast.

“There are a few approvals coming through, but they are far from being sufficient to prevent imminent production halts,” said Jens Eskelund, the president of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China. “We are still facing a major disruption of supply chains.”

To make matters worse, some Chinese rare earth magnet makers have stopped producing while waiting for permission to resume exports. The weekslong gap in magnet production is moving through supply chains and may soon reach manufacturers.

“China could bring America’s automotive assembly plants to a standstill,” said Michael Dunne, an automotive consultant specializing in China.

China produces 90 percent of the world’s nearly 200,000 tons a year of high-performance rare earth magnets. Japanese companies produce most of the rest in Japan and Vietnam, mainly for Japanese manufacturers.

The United States produces practically none, although small factories will start full production this year in South Carolina and Texas. A succession of administrations has tried to restart the industry ever since China drew attention to its dominance by imposing a two-month embargo on shipments of rare earths to Japan during a territorial dispute in 2010.

Worldwide sales of mined rare earths total only $5 billion a year. That is minuscule compared with $300 billion industries like copper mining or iron ore mining.

China has a formidable competitive advantage. The state-owned industry has few environmental compliance costs for its mines and an almost unlimited government budget for building huge processing refineries and magnet factories.

Processing rare earths is technically demanding, but China has developed new processes. Rare earth chemistry programs are offered in 39 universities across the country, while the United States has no similar programs.

China refines over 99 percent of the world’s supply of so-called heavy rare earths, which are the least common kinds of rare earths. Heavy rare earths are essential for making magnets that can resist the high temperatures and electrical fields found in cars, semiconductors and many other technologies.

The sole American rare earths mine, located in Mountain Pass, Calif., stopped producing in 1998 after traces of heavy metals and faintly radioactive material leaked from a desert pipeline. Chinese state-controlled companies tried three times without success to buy the defunct mine before it was acquired by American investors in 2008.

A $1 billion Pentagon-backed investment program followed in 2010 to improve environmental compliance and expand the mine and its adjacent refinery. But the costly complex was unable to compete when it briefly reopened in 2014, and closed again the next year.

MP Materials, a Chicago investor group that included a minority partner company partly owned by the Chinese government, bought the mine in 2017. The mine reopened the next year, but shipped its ore to China for the difficult task of separating the various kinds of rare earths.

Only in recent months has the mine become able to chemically separate the rare earths in more than half its output. But this loses money because processing in China is so inexpensive.

MP Materials built the new factory in Texas that will turn separated rare earths into magnets.

A considerable bottleneck lies in transforming separated rare earths into chemically pure metal ingots that can be fed into the furnaces of magnet-making machines. A New England start-up, Phoenix Tailings, is addressing that shortcoming, but its small scale underlines the challenge.

Phoenix Tailings has taken over much of the staff and equipment of Infinium, a start-up that had tried to do the same thing. Infinium ran out of money in 2020, when American policymakers were more focused on the Covid-19 pandemic than rare earths.

With Chinese rare earth minerals hard to get, Phoenix makes the metal from mine tailings: leftover material at mines that has already been processed once to remove another material, like iron.

Phoenix Tailings has four machines each the size of a small cottage at its factory in Burlington, Mass. Each one produces a 6.6-pound ingot every three hours around the clock. The operation’s overall capacity is 40 tons a year, said Nick Myers, Phoenix’s chief executive. He declined to identify the buyer but said it was an automotive company.

Phoenix is installing equipment at a larger site in Exeter, N.H., to produce metal at a rate of 200 tons a year — still tiny compared with Chinese factories that produce more than that in a month.

Thomas Villalón Jr., Phoenix’s chief technical officer, said that ramping up production quickly was important during a trade war: “It’s a race right now.”

The US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022 launched a 10-year clean energy industrial policy, but core elements now face repeal under the “Big, Beautiful Bill.” The House of Representatives approved the bill, and the Senate will vote next.

Unprecedented announcements in US clean energy followed the 2022 law. E2 tracks these announcements in its Clean Economy Works report. Since the IRA was passed, over 390 clean energy projects in 42 states representing over $130 billion in investment and 120,000 jobs have been announced, according to the report.

However, if the Senate passes the budget resolution as-written, core elements of the IRA, including the Investment Tax Credit and Production Tax Credit, will be repealed for projects not placed in service by 2028. This ends critical clean energy industrial policy support about five years ahead of schedule.

This uncertainty, combined with uncertainty surrounding tariff rates and enforcement, has led to a growing number of cancelled projects and factories. E2 said $14 billion in clean energy projects and 10,000 jobs have been cancelled in 2025. About $4.5 billion in cancellations occurred in April alone, said E2.

“Now is not the time to raise taxes on clean energy and compound the business uncertainty that is clearly taking a greater and greater toll on US manufacturing and jobs,” said Michael Timberlake, director of communications at E2.

Most of the canceled investments occurred in Republican districts. Democratic House members unanimously voted against the budget bill, but it was approved by a razor-thin majority due to strong Republican support.

More than $12 billion in investment and 13,000 jobs have been cancelled in Republican voting districts thus far, said E2. Through April, over 61% of all clean energy projects announced – along with 72% of all jobs and 82% of all investments – are in congressional districts represented by Republicans.

“Businesses are now counting on Congress to come to its senses and stop this costly attack on an industry that is essential to meeting America’s growing energy demand and that’s driving unprecedented economic growth in every part of the country,” said Timberlake.

The directive invokes a provision of federal law that is typically reserved for emergencies, including extreme weather events and wartime situations.

Owned and operated by Constellation, the Eddystone generating station began operations in 1960.

With a capacity of 820MW, it is located on the Delaware River in Eddystone, Pennsylvania, south of Philadelphia.

The plant has two remaining units capable of burning either natural gas or oil during times of high power demand.

The latest order comes after a department mandate on 23 May 2025 that the JH Campbell coal-fired power plant in West Olive, Michigan, remain active past its planned shutdown date of 31 May.

The Trump administration states that these actions were prompted by various factors, including an electricity shortage. This decision faced criticism from the chair of the Michigan Public Service Commission, who argued that there was no actual emergency.

Natural Resources Defence Council managing director Kit Kennedy was quoted by the media outlet: “The Department of Energy’s move to keep these zombie plants online will have significant public health impacts and increase electricity costs for people in Michigan and Pennsylvania.

“These dirty and expensive fossil plants were slated to close because they could not compete with cheaper, cleaner alternatives.”

The Energy Department issued a second order following PJM Interconnection’s acceptance of Constellation’s retirement notice for its Eddystone plant following an evaluation of whether the plant’s closure would impact grid reliability. However, in a statement released on 31 May, PJM, which oversees the largest US grid stretching from Washington DC to Illinois, expressed its support for the Energy Department’s order.

On Saturday 31 May, following the order, Constellation announced immediate actions aimed at maintaining operations at last units at its Eddystone power plant throughout the summer months while exploring options for extended functionality until work can be completed at Pennsylvania’s closed Three Mile Island nuclear plant.

In all, North Carolina boasts over 109,000 clean energy jobs, the ninth most in the country, per the national nonprofit E2.
This 10-year runway of economic certainty sparked a wave of clean energy development across the country.
“Removing these credits would pull the rug out from under the auto and aligned battery industries at a critical time, immediately putting North Carolina jobs at risk,” he said.
Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Jerry Moran of Kansas, and John Curtis of Utah — echoes concerns flagged by clean energy advocates and businesses.","Now that the U.S. House of Representatives has passed a measure to kill nearly every federal tax credit there is to support the clean energy transition, gobsmacked advocates and industry leaders in solar, wind, and electric vehicles are looking desperately to the Senate to amend it.

In North Carolina, that means all eyes turn to senior U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis, a second-term Republican up for reelection next year in this steadfast purple state, which is already reaping benefits from the clean energy economy.

“Sen. Tillis is going to be so important, along with other voices,” said Stephen Smith, executive director of the nonprofit Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, ​“because he has indicated that we don’t want to whipsaw 180 degrees back and forth between approaches to energy policy.”

Tillis is among four Senate Republicans who signed an April letter urging a targeted approach to reforming renewable energy tax incentives rather than a wholesale repeal. The four signatories alone could sink the House measure if they joined Senate Democrats in opposing it.

The senator’s stance, the economic benefits of clean energy, and bipartisan support among voters for solar, wind, and efficiency all give advocates in the state some cause for cautious optimism. So does the reality that solar and batteries are the quickest, cheapest way to solidify the nation’s ​“energy dominance,” a frequently stated goal of President Donald Trump.

“We need energy today and tomorrow,” said Chris Carmody, executive director of Carolinas Clean Energy Business Association, a trade group. ​“Not only are renewables and storage the lowest-cost option, they’re also the fastest to build.”

The clean energy economy has an intricate foothold in North Carolina. Largely owing to its acres upon acres of solar fields, the state was home to the fourth most solar capacity in the country last year, supporting over 7,000 jobs, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association. And the region doesn’t just use solar equipment, it also makes it: Vietnamese panel manufacturer Boviet Solar opened its first U.S. plant in Greenville, North Carolina, in April, with plans for expansion next year that would create over 1,300 local jobs.

The Tar Heel State is also a leader in the emerging electric vehicle supply chain, with lithium mines, Toyota’s massive battery plant in Randolph County, and EV factories all in the works. Its robust manufacturing sector already produces a number of renewable energy components. In all, North Carolina boasts over 109,000 clean energy jobs, the ninth most in the country, per the national nonprofit E2.

The federal tax credits that helped spur this economic activity were first enacted decades ago with bipartisan support. Combined with favorable state policies, that means that wind, solar, and battery storage were on the rise during the first Trump administration and before. But the incentives were undoubtedly supercharged by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.

The landmark climate law extended the tax credits for large wind and solar projects and rooftop solar through 2032, then tapered them down over several years. It enacted new and expanded incentives for rooftop solar, EV purchases, and energy-efficiency improvements, set to end around the same time. It also included an advanced manufacturing incentive, designed to spur domestic production of minerals, battery components, and more.

This 10-year runway of economic certainty sparked a wave of clean energy development across the country. After the passage of the climate law in August 2022, E2 says 27 new projects were announced in North Carolina alone, representing an investment of over $21 billion.

House bill takes sledgehammer, not scalpel, to clean energy incentives

Experts say the House Republicans’ budget measure, which cleared the chamber by just one vote, would imperil all of these economic gains. The tax credits that benefit large clean energy projects will last until 2028, but only for those that begin construction within 60 days of the bill’s passage, an impossibility for most.

“Unless your project is shovel-ready and has gotten every permit, there’s no project, in any type of energy, that can go from zero to begin in 60 days,” Carmody said.

The rare developer who can begin construction that quickly faces another seemingly insurmountable hurdle: It must document that no component of its project, no matter how small, is linked to a ​“Foreign Entity of Concern” such as China. That requirement also applies to the advanced energy manufacturing tax credit, rendering that incentive all but useless even though it’s extended beyond 2028.

“It’s never been done before for any industry. It’s incredibly onerous,” said John Szoka, CEO of the Conservative Energy Network. ​“We have a global interconnected economy. We definitely want more manufacturing back in the U.S., and I agree with the president 100% on that. But the way that [provision] is worded, it’s almost impossible to meet.”

The House bill abruptly eliminates at year’s end an array of tax credits for EVs and charging infrastructure. Combined with the poison-pill provision on foreign components in advanced manufacturing, the termination of those incentives could kneecap the state’s burgeoning EV sector.

“The bill passed by the House takes a sledgehammer to North Carolina’s EV industry and undermines efforts to build secure and reliable access to critical minerals,” said Ben Prochazka, the North Carolina-based executive director of the Electrification Coalition, a national nonprofit.

“Removing these credits would pull the rug out from under the auto and aligned battery industries at a critical time, immediately putting North Carolina jobs at risk,” he said.

Individual consumers are dealt perhaps the sharpest blow by the House bill. Like the EV incentives, the credits for rooftop solar, energy-efficiency improvements, and the like would be eliminated at the end of this year. Studies show the resulting spike in demand for gasoline and increased electricity use will raise costs for everyone.

Tillis says budget bill will undergo changes in the Senate

Tillis’ office didn’t respond to a request for comment. But the letter he penned in April — along with Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Jerry Moran of Kansas, and John Curtis of Utah — echoes concerns flagged by clean energy advocates and businesses.

“For energy credits that provide a direct passthrough benefit to ratepayers, repeals would translate into immediate utility bill increases, placing additional strain on hardworking Americans,” the senators warn.

They advocate a ​“balanced” approach to reforming the tax incentives. ​“We caution against the full-scale repeal of current credits, which could lead to significant disruptions for the American people and weaken our position as a global energy leader,” the letter says.

Noting the ​“substantial” investments American companies have already made ​“based on the current energy tax framework,” the senators also write that a complete repeal would inject uncertainty into the market — jeopardizing capital allocation, long-term project planning, and job creation.

After the passage of the House bill just before Memorial Day weekend, Politico reported that Tillis wasn’t backing away from his letter.

“We have a lot of work that we need to do on the timeline and scope of the production and investment tax credits,” the incentives that mostly benefit large wind and solar projects, he told Politico. ​“Undoubtedly, there’s going to be changes.”

Carmody says the comments fit with Tillis’ track record.

“We applaud his position so far and his effort to support a stable and predictable tax system here,” Carmody said. ​“Sen. Tillis is long acquainted with energy business in North Carolina, and he understands the need for certainty for all kinds of industries.”

Polls show Tillis would be on firm political ground if he stood up for the state’s clean energy economy. The most recent survey from Conservatives for Clean Energy shows 72% of all voters in North Carolina, including 55% of Republicans, favor politicians who ​“support policies that encourage renewable options.”

Asked specifically about ​“President Trump’s American energy dominance policy,” only a quarter of the state’s voters, including just under half of Republicans, said they agreed with his plan to ​“expand fossil fuel production while limiting … renewable energy sources like wind and solar.”

The conservative case for extending renewable energy tax incentives is straightforward, said Szoka, who is a former Republican legislator in the North Carolina House of Representatives.

“All forms of energy generation are subsidized in the United States. Every single one — some that have been around longer than newer technologies,” he said, noting that the oil and gas sector has access to tax deductions worth up to 80% of drilling costs.

“I’ve got nothing against the oil and gas industry,” Szoka added. But there’s no reason it should continue to receive tax benefits while those for renewables are so abruptly axed, he said.

Szoka and other conservatives say renewables shouldn’t get incentives indefinitely, and they aren’t committed to the timelines in the Inflation Reduction Act. They also say the fact that the law was passed with only Democratic votes makes it susceptible to attack from the Republican trifecta.

“So, that doesn’t bode well,” Smith said. ​“We are hopeful that Tillis is going to lead and hold his ground firmly.”",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/GettyImages-2213764780.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=77f6c123ce86d6c81a5368fd3c0a35d9,N,,2025-06-02 06:03:26.021356

As the world intensifies its efforts to combat climate change, industries under mounting scrutiny are being challenged to innovate or become obsolete. Cement production, responsible for approximately 8% of global CO₂ emissions, is a prime target for transformation. Now, a pioneering solution from UK-based company RockFuel promises to revolutionise the sector: a Carbon Negative cement process that doesn’t just lower emissions – it reverses them.

With a patented closed-loop manufacturing system that produces ‘carbon neutral CO₂’, RockFuel’s approach offers a scalable, economically viable, and truly climate-positive alternative to conventional cement. This development marks a significant milestone in sustainable construction and positions RockFuel as a key player in the decarbonisation of the global construction materials industry.

Cementing a new future with carbon capture

At the heart of this innovation is RockFuel’s Carbon Neutral Lime Kiln, a high-efficiency system that produces quicklime (CaO) while capturing the CO₂ released during the process. Traditional cement kilns vent this CO₂ directly into the atmosphere. RockFuel’s closed-loop kiln, powered entirely by renewable energy sources – including solar, wind, hydroelectric, or energy recovered from other RockFuel processes – collects over 500 cubic metres of hot CO₂ per cubic metre of limestone rock processed, storing it in a dedicated tank for reuse.

The captured CO₂ is not simply stored or sequestered, it is reintegrated into the production cycle in a novel way, forming the basis of RockFuel’s Carbon Negative cement solution. By closing the loop and incorporating carbon capture at the manufacturing stage, RockFuel offers a blueprint for next-generation industrial processes.

From emission source to carbon sink

In RockFuel’s Carbon Neutral cement process, the cement begins as quicklime (CaO – Calcium Oxide), produced in the company’s kiln from CaCO3, powered by Carbon Neutral energy. It is then blended with clay to create cement, while the captured CO₂ undergoes electrolysis, using excess energy from the system, which contributes towards a carbon-neutral process. This yields solid carbon and carbon-neutral oxygen, both valuable industrial byproducts.

Solid carbon can be used in advanced materials such as carbon fibre and graphene, while oxygen finds applications in steel manufacturing, wastewater treatment, medical technology, and the chemical industry. This multi-output system ensures minimal waste and creates new revenue opportunities, enhancing commercial appeal for investors and manufacturing partners.

Crucially, when RockFuel’s cement is used in construction and the resultant concrete begins to cure, it absorbs additional atmospheric CO₂, turning infrastructure into long-term carbon sinks. This makes the product not just Carbon Neutral, but Carbon Negative across its lifecycle — a critical differentiator in the race toward global decarbonisation in the built environment and infrastructure projects worldwide. While some governments do not generally accept the figures for this natural carbon curing effect, the RockFuel Carbon Negative Cement Process includes a very small fraction of calcium oxide used in ocean projects, where around double the amount of CO₂ is absorbed, which ensures the whole process is Carbon Negative.

Meeting global market demands

The cement industry is forecast to grow from $316.3bn in 2020 to over $463bn by 2026, driven by infrastructure investment, population growth, and urbanisation across all continents. As nations introduce stricter carbon policies, the demand for climate-positive materials is rapidly increasing.

While the Asia-Pacific region continues to dominate production volumes, North America and Europe are leading in regulatory pressure and innovation-driven sustainability strategies. Both public and private sectors, governments, investors, and project developers are searching for materials that offer verifiable carbon reductions without compromising performance, compatibility, or cost-effectiveness. RockFuel’s solution addresses all three.

The chemical properties of the cement remain identical to traditional formulations, meaning it can be used in existing applications, such as poured concrete or precast components, without altering construction methods or regulatory standards. This makes it an ideal drop-in alternative for infrastructure projects, from transport networks to commercial buildings and renewable energy installations, such as the cement foundations for wind turbines and electricity transmission towers.

Verified, patented, and ready for global partnerships

RockFuel’s technology has undergone independent chemical engineering validation and financial modelling, demonstrating both technical feasibility and commercial viability. The company holds multiple international patents, with further applications pending, ensuring that this innovation is protected and ready for global licensing and industrial adoption.

The company is now seeking strategic partnerships with:

Cement, lime, concrete producers, and lime kiln manufacturers looking to decarbonise operations and ensure their long-term viability in a climate-positive world;

Universities and research institutes interested in co-operating on materials science, industrial chemistry, or sustainability innovations, e.g. via Horizon Europe collaboration;

Government agencies focused on green infrastructure, industrial transition, a climate-positive built environment and clean energy policy;

Impact investors and clean-tech funds seeking scalable, commercially sound climate solutions that are profitable and ready for upscaling.

Building toward a truly sustainable planet

The cement industry has long been seen as incompatible with true sustainability goals. RockFuel is overturning that perception. With a technology that turns CO₂ emissions into valuable outputs and cement-based infrastructure into carbon sinks, RockFuel is not just reducing the impact of cement, it is transforming it into one of the most climate-positive building materials available.

This innovation has the potential to reframe how construction contributes to environmental targets, no longer as a reluctant emitter, but as an active agent in atmospheric carbon reduction. It allows built environments to become tools in the fight against climate change, offering governments and industries a real, scalable way to build better and cleaner.

As the world races to decarbonise, RockFuel offers a ready-to-implement ‘Real Zero’ solution for one of the hardest-to-abate sectors. For policymakers, researchers, and industry leaders, it represents a beacon of what’s possible when circular design, energy transition, and practical innovation converge.",https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ROCKFUE1-29632-Profile-ONE-shutterstockElnur_1396873844-1024x576.jpg,N,,2025-06-02 03:02:15.685580

The senators who sponsored and support this proposed legislation that unfairly targets producers of alternative energy should be ashamed, but that’s unlikely.","Disdain for alternative energy sources, especially solar energy, is a widely held mindset among conservative politicians. These politicians offer baseless false narratives about solar and wind power generation that media outlets find difficult to effectively counter.

Alternative energy, particularly renewables such as solar and wind, are increasingly competitive with traditional fossil fuels. This is why conservative politicians relentlessly malign alternative energy.

It should come as no surprise that politicians who vote to maintain the fossil fuel status quo receive significant campaign contributions from fossil fuel industries.

A bill was recently introduced in the PA Senate (Senate Bill 349) that would place decommissioning requirements on solar energy installations. At first glance, this may seem sensible enough, as the panels in large solar systems will eventually–that is, in 25 to 30 years–need to be replaced. However, the emphasis on decommissioning solar projects, which are non-toxic and contribute nothing harmful to the environment, is misplaced when compared with other energy sectors. Consider the extensive negative environmental impacts associated with coal mining, oil production, and natural gas extraction. These same legislators conveniently ignore the short- and long-term impacts of fossil fuel energy, often to the detriment of their own constituents.

Coal strip mining has long had bonding requirements, but the bond amounts have been a fraction of what is needed to reclaim abandoned mines. When coal companies go bankrupt or fail to adequately bond their operations, as they often do, Pennsylvania taxpayers pick up the tab.

Similarly, decommissioned oil and gas wells are expensive to cap or plug, costing tens- to hundreds-of-thousands of dollars per well. Well bonds are only a few thousand dollars, mandated to remain at a low amount by other recent legislative action. Oil and gas operators walk away from these wells, forfeiting the tiny bond amount, and frequently declare bankruptcy.

Pennsylvania has hundreds of thousands of such abandoned wells. Permanently capping or plugging these wells prevents methane gas from leaking into the atmosphere and polluting our air and water. Taxpayers are most often left to cover the costs of capping and plugging.

The senators who sponsored and support this proposed legislation that unfairly targets producers of alternative energy should be ashamed, but that’s unlikely. They know which side their bread is buttered on.

Senate Bill 349 is an onerous, vindictive proposal, and Senators Yaw, Dush, Brooks, Hutchinson, Vogel, and Stefano — whose districts host oil and/or gas wells — should reflect on their obligation to the people of Pennsylvania.

Despite vast renewable energy potential, Pennsylvania currently ranks 49th in the U.S. for renewable energy growth. Our failure to promote alternative energy, combined with the inevitable price increase in natural gas, will cost electric ratepayers billions of dollars in the coming years. Pennsylvania has an immense, largely untapped opportunity when it comes to clean energy. It’s past time our elected representatives stop impeding cheaper and non-polluting energy sources, and begin to represent their constituents and not the fossil fuel industry.

Green campaigners said a condition of any extension should be that Drax published a key report by KPMG into its operations and sourcing.
Ofgem has said KPMG shows Drax has not breached rules on sourcing trees for burning from environmentally sustainable forests.
Drax is expected to receive more than £10bn in renewable energy subsidies between 2012 and 2027, the current regime period, according to the thinktank Ember.
They don’t deserve further public money.” The government plans to halve the subsidies available for biomass power generation under a revised regime from 2027.","The owner of the Drax wood-burning power station should be forced to disclose full details of its tree consumption, campaigners have argued, as MPs review the billions in renewables subsidies the North Yorkshire plant receives.

A delegated legislation committee will decide on Monday whether to pass the government’s plans to extend billpayer-funded subsidies to the country’s biomass power generators, of which Drax is by far the biggest.

Green campaigners said a condition of any extension should be that Drax published a key report by KPMG into its operations and sourcing. Reports by the auditor have been provided to the government and the energy regulator Ofgem but not the public.

Ofgem has said KPMG shows Drax has not breached rules on sourcing trees for burning from environmentally sustainable forests.

However, in separate incidents, Drax had been found to have supplied inaccurate data for subsidies in the past, leading to a £25m fine. Media investigations also found Drax using wood from old-growth forests in the US.

Drax is expected to receive more than £10bn in renewable energy subsidies between 2012 and 2027, the current regime period, according to the thinktank Ember.

Kingsmill Bond, an energy strategist at Ember, said: “Burning trees for electricity is extremely inefficient and expensive, and is not effective at mitigating climate change.

“The collapse in the price of solar, wind and batteries in the last five years means that burning trees for electricity is now an obsolete technology. Before we pour any more subsidy into Drax, MPs need to see the KMPG report on where the wood has been coming from.”

Dale Vince, founder of Ecotricity, a green energy company, said: “If Drax don’t come clean about their operations, how can we trust them? They don’t deserve further public money.”

The government plans to halve the subsidies available for biomass power generation under a revised regime from 2027. MPs on the delegated legislation committee are expected to vote on Monday on the statutory instrument enabling this.

Almuth Ernsting, the co-director of the campaign group Biofuelwatch, said: “If those subsidies are approved, it would result in more carbon emissions, more destructive logging of wildlife-rich forests in the south-eastern US and elsewhere, and more pollution suffered by communities living next to pellet plants in that region – pollution which community activists have denounced as ‘environmental racism’.”

Mark Campanale, the founder of the Carbon Tracker Initiative, added: “At a time when renewables powered by wind, solar with back up batteries are growing exponentially around the world, it seems remarkable that the UK still needs to rely on dirty combustion like Drax to reach its climate targets. Instead of importing and burning wood, with all its associated emissions, the UK should be doubling down on natural sources of energy available to us, wind and solar.”

A spokesperson for Drax said: “In their investigation Ofgem found no evidence that our biomass failed to meet the sustainability criteria of the RO [renewable obligation] scheme, nor that the ROCs [renewable obligation certificates] we received for the renewable power we produced had been provided incorrectly.

“Their new statement on the reports we commissioned from KPMG, as well as the prior comments in a public accounts committee hearing by Ofgem’s director of audit and compliance, confirm that they reviewed these documents as part of their investigation and found no evidence within them that we were in breach of our sustainability obligations and therefore wrong to receive RO funding.”

The spokesperson added: “Drax provides secure renewable power to millions of homes and businesses when they need it, not just when the wind is blowing, or the sun is shining. The science underpinning biomass generation is supported by the world’s leading climate experts, including the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the UK’s Climate Change Committee.”

A spokesperson for the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said: “We are halving the amount of support for Drax, saving money on people’s energy bills and contributing to our energy security. Drax will operate for less of the time under a clean power system and will need to use 100% sustainably sourced biomass, with not a penny of subsidy paid for anything less.”

However, we must remain consistent in implementing this by considering our capabilities, energy availability levels, and economic factors,” Lahadalia said.

The RUPTL aims to support the country’s state-owned electricity company, PLT, in delivering 69.5GW of new energy generation by 2034.

Of the 69.5GW figure, 42.6GW will come from renewables. Specifically, solar PV will make up the bulk of this with 17.1GW targeted, hydropower comes second with 11.7GW, and wind generation comes third with 7.2GW. 5.2GW of geothermal and 0.9GW of bioenergy generation is also targeted as part of the wider figure.

The remaining 69.5GW capacity will be filled by gas and coal plants, totalling 10.3GW and 6.2GW, respectively, and two small modular nuclear reactors, totalling 0.5GW, planned for Sumatra and Kalimantan.

In addition, 10.3GW of energy storage is also targeted to support grid stability.

This means that 76% of the country’s new energy generation capacity will be comprised of renewable energy sources, contributing to an uptake in the overall electricity mix to 35% by 2034. For reference, this currently stands at 12%.

Inclusion of coal and gas-fired plants attracts criticism

The inclusion of coal and gas-fired generation has drawn criticism from the Institute for Essential Services Reform, an Indonesian energy sector think tank.

Indeed, its executive director, Fabby Tumiwa, said the inclusion of 2.8GW of coal-fired power plants that will still be operational after 2030 is inconsistent with the country’s net zero emissions target of achieving this by 2060 or sooner.

Tumiwa added that the 42.6GW figure is lower than the Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP) commitment of 56GW by 2030 and is not in line with the need to limit global temperature increases to 1.5 degrees Celsius according to the Paris Agreement.

“PLN is currently facing difficulties in meeting the availability of gas for its generators. If demand increases two to three times in the future, the threat and risk to meeting PLN’s gas needs will be even greater. In this situation, the development of larger renewable energy is a lower risk option because it not only strengthens the reliability of the energy system, but also contributes to the creation of more affordable energy costs for the community,” Tumiwa said.

‘Massive grid upgrade’ is the backbone of Indonesia’s transition

Alongside the massive uptick in potential renewable energy generation, perhaps one of the most significant announcements made by the government is plans for a “massive grid upgrade” forming the backbone of the country’s energy transition.

Indonesia is one of the largest archipelagos in the world and has roughly 17,508 officially listed islands within the territory of the Republic of Indonesia. This creates geographic complications when trying to develop a nationwide grid infrastructure.

As part of the RUPTL, PLN will develop nearly 48,000km of new transmission lines, larger than the circumference of the Earth (roughly 40,000km), and with 108,000MVA in substation capacity.

This will help Indonesia develop a sufficient grid to connect communities and provide a just transition for its citizens.

Lahadalia emphasised that providing energy access to villages currently cut off from the grid is a priority for the Indonesian government.

“For me, energy is not just about needs, but also a form of equity and justice that we must implement from Aceh to Papua. President Prabowo Subianto’s directive is to immediately install electricity in villages that don’t have it yet. So we will complete this by 2029, and we will do this gradually starting from now,” Lahadalia said.

Via the RUPTL, PT PLN aims to power over 5,700 remote villages and connect nearly 780,000 households via the Village Electricity Program.

Nuki Agya Utama, executive director of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Centre for Energy, explained on LinkedIn that Indonesia’s grid has been “historically segmented by necessity: each main island or region operates its electrical system, isolated by seas” in comparison to the more traditional continental grids in the US, China, and Europe.

As such, Indonesia’s dispersed island structure makes nationwide grids costly and complex. To achieve this, Utama said the country must utilise long-distance inter-island connections via submarine cables, which are resource-intensive and often face environmental and logistical constraints.

Macron in attendance for TotalEnergies, RGE solar-plus-storage deal

Last week, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, was in attendance as TotalEnergies and Indonesia’s Royal Golden Eagle (RGE), via its equally-owned joint venture Singa Renewables, agreed to co-invest in a solar-plus-storage project in Indonesia.

The size of the project has not been disclosed. PV Tech has reached out to TotalEnergies for confirmation of the project size but has not received a response at the time of reporting.

The agreement was signed at the Indonesian Presidential Palace in Jakarta, with Indonesian president Prabowo Subianto and Emmanuel Macron in attendance.

Little has been disclosed about the project as yet, except that it will be constructed in phases and located in the Riau Province of Indonesia, on the central eastern coast of Sumatra.

The companies have also secured a conditional licence from Singapore’s Energy Market Authority (EMA) to import 1GW of the project’s energy to the city-state.

“Our utility-scale project underscores TotalEnergies’ commitment to supporting the region’s energy transition efforts, while ensuring energy security. This project aims to drive the development of regional renewable energy infrastructure and advance the ASEAN Power Grid vision,” said Helle Kristoffersen, president of Asia and member of the executive committee at TotalEnergies.

The two companies also signed a memorandum of understanding with Singapore Energy Interconnections (SGEI) to develop a subsea interconnector between the countries jointly.

Kristoffersen added: “The project will contribute to Singapore’s goal of reaching net zero emissions by 2050, while supporting Riau Province’s economic development in Indonesia.”",https://www.pv-tech.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Image-of-Macron-Indonesia-Image-TotalEnergies.jpg,N,,2025-06-02 03:02:24.927481

Trump's Republican administration is supporting the development of fossil fuels in contrast to his Democratic predecessor Joe Biden, who had massively supported the production of renewable aviation fuels through tax credits.
- 'Entirely achievable' - The air transportation industry has faced growing pressure to deal with its contribution to the climate crisis.
To achieve net-zero emissions, airlines rely on non-fossil sources known as Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).
""This represents only 0.7 percent of total aviation needs,"" IATA Director General Willie Walsh said.","The airline industry's flagship goal of decarbonising by 2050 is now ""in peril"" due to climate-sceptic policies, including those of US President Donald Trump, the leading airline association IATA warned on Sunday.

The emergence of leaders favouring fossil fuels and recent regulatory rollbacks are ""obviously a setback... it does imperil success on the 2050 horizon"", Marie Owens Thomsen, the International Air Transport Association's senior vice president for sustainability, told reporters.

""But I don't think it's going to halt or reverse progress. I think it will just slow progress,"" she said at the IATA annual industry conference in India.

Trump's Republican administration is supporting the development of fossil fuels in contrast to his Democratic predecessor Joe Biden, who had massively supported the production of renewable aviation fuels through tax credits.

UN aviation agency members, from the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), have set the year 2050 as their goal for achieving net-zero carbon emissions for air travel -- an industry often criticised for its outsized role in climate change.

- 'Entirely achievable' -

The air transportation industry has faced growing pressure to deal with its contribution to the climate crisis.

Currently responsible for 2.5 percent to three percent of global CO2 emissions, the sector's switch to renewable fuels is proving difficult, even if the aeronautics industry and energy companies have been seeking progress.

To achieve net-zero emissions, airlines rely on non-fossil sources known as Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

However, SAF biofuels are still three to four times more expensive than petroleum-based jet fuel.

""Another problem, which is related, is the fact that oil is so cheap,"" Owens Thomsen said. ""I think that also diminishes the sense of urgency that people have.""

A barrel of Brent North Sea crude, the international benchmark, stands below $65 as a result of Trump's tariffs, his call to ""drill baby drill"" and especially a decision by OPEC+ to hike crude output quotas.

This represents an immediate boon for airlines, whose fuel costs represent between a quarter and a third of operating expenses.

SAF is seen as a crucial ingredient in hitting emissions targets. The biofuel produces lower carbon emissions than traditional jet fuel and is made from plant and animal materials such as cooking oil and fat.

European Union rules require carriers to include two percent of SAF in their fuel mix starting this year, rising to six percent in 2030 before soaring to 70 percent from 2050.

Owens Thomsen estimated on Sunday that $4.7 trillion in investment is needed to establish SAF sectors capable of meeting the needs of air transport by 2050.

""It is entirely achievable,"" she said, adding that the raw materials and technology already exist and simply need to be developed.

""The money involved is very comparable to the money that was involved in creating the previous new energy markets, notably obviously wind and solar,"" she said.

That money could be found just by stopping subsidies to oil producers, she said.

""The world is subsidising large oil companies to the height of $1 trillion per year,"" she said.

""With that money, if it were redirected in its totality, we could solve our energy transition in less than five years.""

IATA also indicated on Sunday that it expects global SAF production to double this year compared with 2024 to 2.5 billion litres -- slightly down from its previous projections of 2.7 billion litres.

""This represents only 0.7 percent of total aviation needs,"" IATA Director General Willie Walsh said.

This becomes a vicious circle, with less sea ice allowing more solar energy to reach and warm the water, leading to more ice melting.","Oceans have absorbed the vast majority of the warming caused by burning fossil fuels and shielded societies from the full impact of greenhouse gas emissions.

But this crucial ally has developed alarming symptoms of stress -- heatwaves, loss of marine life, rising sea levels, falling oxygen levels and acidification caused by the uptake of excess carbon dioxide.

These effects risk not just the health of the ocean but the entire planet.

- Heating up -

By absorbing more than 90 percent of the excess heat trapped in the atmosphere by greenhouse gases, ""oceans are warming faster and faster"", said Angelique Melet, an oceanographer at the European Mercator Ocean monitor.

The UN's IPCC climate expert panel has said the rate of ocean warming -- and therefore its heat uptake -- has more than doubled since 1993.

Average sea surface temperatures reached new records in 2023 and 2024.

Despite a respite at the start of 2025, temperatures remain at historic highs, according to data from the Europe Union's Copernicus climate monitor.

The Mediterranean has set a new temperature record in each of the past three years and is one of the basins most affected, along with the North Atlantic and Arctic oceans, said Thibault Guinaldo, of France's CEMS research centre.

Marine heatwaves have doubled in frequency, become longer lasting and more intense, and affect a wider area, the IPCC said in its special oceans report.

Warmer seas can make storms more violent, feeding them with heat and evaporated water.

The heating water can also be devastating for species, especially corals and seagrass beds, which are unable to migrate.

For corals, between 70 percent and 90 percent are expected to be lost this century if the world reaches 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) of warming compared to pre-industrial levels.

Scientists expect that threshold -- the more ambitious goal of the Paris climate deal -- to be breached in the early 2030s or even before.

- Relentless rise -

When a liquid or gas warms up, it expands and takes up more space.

In the case of the oceans, this thermal expansion combines with the slow but irreversible melting of the world's ice caps and mountain glaciers to lift the world's seas.

The pace at which global oceans are rising has doubled in three decades and if current trends continue it will double again by 2100 to about one centimetre per year, according to recent research.

Around 230 million people worldwide live less than a metre above sea level, vulnerable to increasing threats from floods and storms.

""Ocean warming, like sea-level rise, has become an inescapable process on the scale of our lives, but also over several centuries,"" said Melet.

""But if we reduce greenhouse gas emissions, we will reduce the rate and magnitude of the damage, and gain time for adaptation"".

- More acidity, less oxygen -

The ocean not only stores heat, it has also taken up 20 to 30 percent of all humans' carbon dioxide emissions since the 1980s, according to the IPCC, causing the waters to become more acidic.

Acidification weakens corals and makes it harder for shellfish and the skeletons of crustaceans and certain plankton to calcify.

""Another key indicator is oxygen concentration, which is obviously important for marine life,"" said Melet.

Oxygen loss is due to a complex set of causes including those linked to warming waters.

- Reduced sea ice -

Combined Arctic and Antarctic sea ice cover -- frozen ocean water that floats on the surface -- plunged to a record low in mid-February, more than a million square miles below the pre-2010 average.

This becomes a vicious circle, with less sea ice allowing more solar energy to reach and warm the water, leading to more ice melting.

This feeds the phenomenon of ""polar amplification"" that makes global warming faster and more intense at the poles, said Guinaldo.

These policy levies mean the UK pays some of the highest energy bills in the world, and are simultaneously disadvantaging British industry and stifling the efforts of households to transition to lower-carbon heating systems, according to industry trade groups.
Stephen Phipson, Make UK’s chief executive, said: “If we do not address the issue of high industrial energy costs in the UK as a priority, we risk the security of our country.

These policy levies mean the UK pays some of the highest energy bills in the world, and are simultaneously disadvantaging British industry and stifling the efforts of households to transition to lower-carbon heating systems, according to industry trade groups.

Make UK has warned that the government’s long-awaited industrial policy is at risk of being derailed by the high energy prices charged to UK manufacturers, which the lobby group states make the sector’s energy bills 46% higher than the global average.

The trade organisation has called on the government to cut industrial energy costs as part of Labour’s long-awaited industrial strategy, which is due later this month, by reforming “the complex and unfair policy levies that make low-carbon energy more expensive than fossil fuels”.

Its plan includes the state underwriting a fixed energy price for manufacturers. Under the scheme, manufacturing firms would receive top-up payments from the government if energy wholesale costs rise beyond the set price – but they would repay the difference to the exchequer if the wholesale price falls below the agreed price.

Stephen Phipson, Make UK’s chief executive, said: “If we do not address the issue of high industrial energy costs in the UK as a priority, we risk the security of our country. We will fail to attract investment in the manufacturing sector and will rapidly enter a phase of renewed de-industrialisation.”

“UK manufacturers have faced energy prices far above those of European competitors for many years, undermining their ability to invest, grow, and compete globally,” Phipson said.

Another trade organisation, Energy UK, blamed the government’s levies, which predominantly fall on electricity bills, for making cleaner alternatives such heat pumps artificially expensive in comparison with gas.

The energy sector trade body, which represents energy suppliers, has proposed “rebalancing” the charges currently levied on electricity bills on to gas bills, saving homes using electric heating £400 a year. State subsidies should then be used to ease the burden on low- and middle- income gas-using households that would face an extra annual cost of £40 under its proposal, it said.

Overall the scheme would make the government’s move from gas heating to electric heating about £40bn cheaper by 2040 compared with a situation in which policy costs are not removed from bills.

A government spokesperson said: “Through our clean power mission, we will get off the rollercoaster of fossil fuel markets – protecting business and household finances with clean, homegrown energy that we control.”

The spokesperson said that it was bringing energy costs for UK industries closer in line with other major economies through its British Industry Supercharger, a government energy cost-cutting programme for firms in sectors such as steel, metals and chemicals, which is expected to save businesses £5bn over the next 10 years.

“We are also looking at a range of options for longer-term energy market reform, including the rebalancing of gas and electricity prices, with the impact on consumers at the heart of our approach,” the spokesperson added.

The comments about the government’s imminent industrial strategy proposals come as British business faces a string of challenges over the coming months.

The business and trade secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, is expected to urge Donald Trump’s administration to cut a deal to reduce taxes on UK steel exports to zero this week, after the US president vowed to double his global steel tariff to 50%.

Elsewhere, private sector companies expect activity to fall in the three months to August to their weakest level for three years, according to the CBI’s latest growth survey.

The grid operator maintains a balance between power demand and supply and a stable electrical system.

The wind and solar output is reduced by price signals or through an order to reduce output. This reduction is generally implemented during periods of congestion when transmission lines lack sufficient capacity to deliver the available energy or during oversupply when generation exceeds demand.

In 2024, CAISO curtailed 3.4 million MWh of utility-scale wind and solar output, a 29% increase from the electricity curtailed in 2023.

CAISO also curtails solar generation to leave room for natural gas generation. A certain amount of natural gas generation must remain online throughout the day to comply with North American Electric Reliability Corporation reliability standards and to have sufficient generation available to ramp up in the evening hours.

In 2024, solar energy accounted for 93% of all energy curtailed by CAISO. The highest amount of solar energy was curtailed during spring, when solar output was relatively high, and electricity demand was low, as moderate spring temperatures reduced the need for space heating or air conditioning.

In 2014, California had a total of 9.7 GW of installed wind and solar photovoltaic capacity. By the end of 2024, this figure had increased to 28.2 GW.

Solar energy supplies almost half of CAISO’s electricity demand between 8 AM and 4 PM. However, demand rises during the later evening hours as people return home from work and switch on appliances such as air conditioners, electric heaters, lights, ovens, computers, and televisions.

This demand is particularly noticeable on hot summer evenings after sunset when solar power is no longer being generated.

Ways of Curtailment

CAISO is trying to reduce curtailments in the following ways:

Trading with neighboring balancing authorities to try to sell excess solar and wind power

Incorporating battery storage into ancillary services, energy, and capacity markets

Including curtailment reduction in transmission planning

Additionally, companies are planning to use excess renewable energy to make hydrogen, some of which will be stored and mixed with natural gas for summer generation at the interstate Intermountain Power Project’s new facility, scheduled to come online in July.

CAISO is also promoting the addition of flexible resources that can quickly respond to sudden changes in demand.

Battery storage may also come online, allowing some renewable energy to be stored and used four to eight hours later in the day. CAISO’s battery capacity was 11.6 GW in 2024, rising 45% from 8.0 GW in 2023.

EIA said it is common for daily electricity generation to outpace consumption during the springtime. Without increased transmission capacity or long-term storage solutions, significant curtailments may still happen during this season.

The U.S. installed a record 50 GW of new solar capacity in 2024, a 21% year-over-year increase, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association’s U.S. Solar Market Insight 2024 Year in Review report.

The manufacturing plant, located in France, will produce these lightweight modules for rooftop installations on roofs with low bearing capacity. The modules are considered ideal for buildings with flat rooftops.

These modules utilize ultra-thin glass measuring 1 mm in thickness.

They can be installed without needing any mounting structures. Heliup’s modules are directly glued to waterproofing membranes using adhesives.

The company’s lightweight module, the Stykon, uses crystalline silicon module cells and is resistant to impact and tearing from natural forces. Heliup claims the module can withstand wind speeds of up to 270 km/h.

The new modules are expected to reduce the weight of rooftop solar systems by 60% compared to conventional systems. Heliup said that the modules weigh roughly 5 kg/m² less than the average module weight of 15 kg/m².

The company claims that the module does not compromise on energy efficiency despite its lighter weight.

The module manufacturing plant received funding of €3.2 million (~$3.61 million) under the Innovation Fund 2024.

Heliup was one of the 18 cleantech projects that signed grant agreements to receive €173 million (~$195.67 million) from the Innovation Fund for their projects. Under the funding program, the Commission can allocate up to €3.4 billion (~$3.84 billion) for these projects.

The Innovation Fund aligns with the EU’s target to produce 40% of its green technology domestically by 2030. In February 2024, the EU reached a provisional agreement on legislation aimed at boosting the bloc’s production of green technologies needed to achieve its goal of cutting carbon emissions by at least 55% by 2030 compared to 1990s levels.

In a recent congressional hearing, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin signaled that the future of Energy Star could soon be in private hands.
“Multiple entities have already reached out to the EPA because they want to take over Energy Star,” he said.
Energy Star also serves as a critical gateway to federal energy efficiency tax incentives.
The private sector is eager to step up, but the question remains: Could the industry rebuild energy benchmarking consensus as quickly as it may lose it?","The Energy Star program has quietly served as the foundation of tracking energy efficiency for over thirty years. Launched as a voluntary initiative to help consumers and businesses identify energy-efficient products, the program has evolved into a widely recognized standard woven deeply into commercial real estate operations, compliance reporting, and investment strategy. The Trump administration has proposed to eliminate Energy Star as part of broader cuts to the Environmental Protection Agency and now the commercial property sector is prepping for what could become a significant operational shake-up.

Created in 1992 under President George H.W. Bush, Energy Star was envisioned as a market-friendly alternative to more rigid environmental regulation. Since then, it has become the central energy benchmark for the residential and commercial property sectors. Its Portfolio Manager tool measures building performance across more than a quarter of all U.S. commercial floor space, with certifications frequently serving as shorthand for ESG reporting, municipal compliance, and capital planning.

The Trump administration’s fiscal year 2026 budget proposes eliminating the EPA’s Atmospheric Protection Program, the umbrella under which Energy Star operates. Officials argue that the program represents unnecessary government intervention and imposes avoidable costs on industry by prioritizing climate goals over economic growth. In a recent congressional hearing, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin signaled that the future of Energy Star could soon be in private hands. “This program is an example of one that can be run outside of the government,” Zeldin told members of the House Energy and Commerce Environment Subcommittee.

Zeldin questioned the consumer savings delivered by the program and suggested it has grown too reliant on public resources. “Multiple entities have already reached out to the EPA because they want to take over Energy Star,” he said. “It’s a program that requires a big staff, a big taxpayer-funded staff, and a whole lot of tax dollars.” The comments mark the strongest indication yet that the EPA under Zeldin is open to offloading one of its most recognizable energy efficiency initiatives.

A high-voltage shock to the system

Energy Star’s elimination would have far-reaching consequences for the commercial real estate industry. In cities such as New York, Boston, and Washington, D.C., local energy disclosure and benchmarking laws are closely linked with Energy Star’s Portfolio Manager.

Many U.S. building performance standards (BPS) and local benchmarking laws, such as New York’s Local Law 97 and Boston’s BERDO 2.0, rely heavily on Portfolio Manager and its 1–100 scores to measure and enforce compliance with energy efficiency mandates. These scores provide a de facto national benchmarking tool for energy use, and in many jurisdictions, they’re central to evaluating compliance and triggering upgrade requirements.

If the Energy Star program were to be disrupted, these local building performance standards could face challenges in terms of compliance, data access, and enforcement, especially in jurisdictions that rely explicitly on Energy Star scores to classify building performance tiers. In many jurisdictions, this could lead to amendments to the regulations to incorporate other benchmarking standards, resulting in further compliance complications.

Energy Star also serves as a critical gateway to federal energy efficiency tax incentives. Certifications issued through the program are directly linked to high-value provisions in the tax code, most notably the Section 45L tax credit for energy-efficient residential construction and the Section 179D deduction for commercial buildings.

Under Section 45L, homebuilders and developers can claim up to $5,000 per dwelling unit for constructing energy-efficient homes that meet specific performance criteria that are benchmarked in part using Energy Star’s standards. Section 179D allows commercial building owners to deduct up to $1.88 per square foot (indexed for inflation) for properties that achieve reductions in energy use. Compliance verification often depends on benchmarking data and documentation generated via Energy Star’s Portfolio Manager.

Any disruption to Energy Star would create uncertainty for property owners relying on these incentives. Without a trusted framework for verifying building performance, owners may face delays in accessing credits or risk being audited over insufficient documentation. This comes at a time when capital for energy retrofits is already constrained, and when energy efficiency has become a linchpin strategy for preserving net operating income, improving ESG metrics, and hedging against future regulatory penalties.

Energy Star’s elimination would likewise disrupt the certification processes for LEED and other green building certifications. For years, Portfolio Manager has served as the backbone of benchmarking for LEED for Existing Buildings, providing a standardized, third-party-verified score that helps buildings demonstrate compliance with minimum energy performance.

LEED isn’t alone. Programs like BREEAM, Fitwel, and the WELL Building Standard also rely on Energy Star to evaluate operational energy use, verify sustainability claims, and award performance points. These systems rely on Energy Star because it provides consistent, transparent metrics across various building types and climates. Without Energy Star, certifying bodies would be forced to revise scoring systems. The result could be a potential loss of credibility in sustainability reporting, particularly at a time when ESG scrutiny and decarbonization mandates are intensifying.

Will the future be fragmented?

Supporters of Energy Star argue that its reliability and accessibility make it irreplaceable. A 2022 EPA report estimated that the program helped avoid $42 billion in energy costs and prevent four billion tons of greenhouse gas emissions. That sentiment is echoed across much of the commercial real estate industry. In April, a coalition of 13 major real estate organizations, including BOMA, NAIOP, and Nareit, sent a letter urging the EPA to preserve the program.

Stephanie Grayson, co-founder and CEO of Cambio, a New York-based provider of real estate operations software, agrees that the impact of losing Energy Star would cause a massive disruption. In response, Cambio quickly launched Cambio Vault in early May, a free benchmarking platform designed to back up data and mirror, as well as modernize, the core functions of Portfolio Manager. The tool offers secure data storage, ESG-aligned emissions tracking, and compliance-ready outputs. It is intended as an emergency backup but also as a potential long-term replacement should Energy Star go dark.

While Cambio Vault checks the technical boxes, the symbolic gap left by losing a federally backed standard may be harder to fill. “No private platform can immediately replicate the decades of trust built by a government program,” Grayson said. “But by offering our solution for free and committing to ongoing data ownership by our users, we believe we can provide the technical replacement while building trust over time.”

The larger concern is fragmentation. A single federal platform has long provided a uniform standard across jurisdictions. Without it, cities and states could adopt conflicting systems, creating a compliance patchwork that’s expensive and difficult to navigate. The fragmentation would lead to duplication of effort, inconsistent data quality, and higher costs for compliance teams.

Grayson said Cambio Vault has already attracted interest from municipalities looking to preserve benchmarking continuity. While she declined to name names, she said many city and state agencies are vigorously evaluating Energy Star backup options. “If federal support for Portfolio Manager were to fade, we absolutely expect local jurisdictions to take action to protect the data infrastructure that underpins their laws,” she said.

Measurabl, one of the most prominent ESG data providers for the real estate industry, is also positioning itself as a successor to Energy Star. The company has sustainability data spanning over 20 billion square feet, more than half of Energy Star’s total coverage. Measurabl already supports over 100,000 buildings with real-time data updates and benchmarking tools. According to CEO Matt Ellis, the company can replicate and improve upon Energy Star’s 1-100 scoring methodology, offering more nuanced, dynamic performance tracking.

Still, Ellis said, “The potential elimination of Energy Star is like a heart attack for the real estate industry in terms of how data works, how regulation works, and how green loans work.” Measurabl is guiding clients through contingency planning, providing step-by-step instructions to export and safeguard Portfolio Manager data.

But while losing Energy Star would be a disruption, Ellis believes this could be an inflection point for benchmarking in real estate, leading to innovations that could surpass the capabilities of Portfolio Manager. “There’s no reason we can’t offer more and more nuanced and real-time benchmarks,” Ellis said. “I think the industry has taken a second look at this and said, huh, maybe we should be doing things differently. Maybe the status quo isn’t in the best interest or service of the industry.”

If Energy Star were eliminated, companies like Cambio or Measurabl would vie to become the private-sector default for energy benchmarking, particularly among institutional real estate portfolios that already use their platforms. With automated data collection, robust ESG analytics, and compliance tracking baked in, these firms are well-positioned to absorb the technical and operational functions that Energy Star currently performs.

Replacing Energy Star entirely is a different matter. What private companies offer in technological sophistication, they lack in public-sector credibility. Ultimately, a post-Energy Star landscape may require a broader coalition of municipalities, certifiers, and ESG platforms to unite and establish a new, standardized energy benchmarking framework. “If the private sector is to take on more responsibility, we need clear standards, open protocols, and a credible certification process to ensure data quality and interoperability,” Cambio’s Grayson said.

She added that it could be similar to financial reporting, where private platforms handle the software, but Generally Accepted Accounting Principles and SEC oversight ensure accountability. “We believe energy data should be treated the same way,” Grayson added.

In the meantime, commercial real estate firms are busy backing up data, reevaluating compliance pathways, and monitoring developments in Washington, D.C. Absent a clear federal standard, the future of building performance tracking would be more competitive but also more complicated. The private sector is eager to step up, but the question remains: Could the industry rebuild energy benchmarking consensus as quickly as it may lose it?",https://propmodo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/energy-efficiency.jpg,N,,2025-06-02 02:06:40.362419

In March, the Trump administration imposed a 10% tariff on imported electricity from Canada — a move that immediately drove up prices and rattled confidence in our energy supply.
New Jersey families deserve a system that works for them, not for entrenched energy interests.","Everyone in New Jersey is feeling the pinch. This summer, electric bills are projected to spike by 20 to 30%. That’s not an abstract statistic — it’s an extra $30 a month for working families already stretched thin. That increase is set to hit monthly utility bills starting in June, but the underlying cause runs deeper, rooted in the decisions of the electrical grid operator for our region, PJM Interconnection, and the federal government.

Let me explain, and provide some solutions.

PJM: The quiet giant behind your electric bill

PJM Interconnection, an organization many New Jerseyans probably have never heard of, manages the electric grid for New Jersey and 12 other states. It’s the largest power grid in North America and is responsible for transmitting electricity, operating a competitive wholesale market and ensuring grid reliability.

Every three years, PJM runs a “capacity auction” — a wonky term for the process that sets the price power generators are paid to keep energy ready for use three years down the line. These decisions determine the utility rates passed on to consumers. In 2023, the amount paid to generators was $28.92 per megawatt-day. Last summer? It skyrocketed to $269.92 — nearly 10 times higher, an outrageous increase. What happened?

PJM claims it’s a simple case of supply and demand — the supply of energy is dwindling, while the demand is surging, which causes prices to increase. But that’s only part of the story. The real issue is that supply has been deliberately obstructed, and demand has been artificially inflated — both by a flawed PJM auction and poor leadership by the Trump administration.

A market rigged against clean energy

PJM claims that higher electricity costs are because of a severe energy supply shortage, but 286 gigawatts, the equivalent of nearly 300 new power plants, are stuck in PJM’s queue for new energy generation. This backlog in required approvals reduces the supply side of the energy equation, resulting in upward pressure on costs. While families are forced to make room in their budgets for rising electricity bills, the energy supply we need to bring costs down is literally sitting there, waiting for PJM to act. Even worse, over 90% of those projects are from clean, renewable energy.

The data shows that clean-energy sources such as solar and wind are over 50% cheaper to run than fossil fuels, but PJM’s bias against clean-energy producers keeps that less expensive power off the table. The result? Ratepayers get stuck footing the bill for older, dirtier, more expensive energy while the cheaper, greener alternatives are left waiting on the sidelines.

Since January, things have only gotten worse.

Trump’s energy sabotage

In President Trump’s first week in office, the administration took steps to halt green energy innovation across the country. That single move killed three major wind projects in New Jersey that would have generated enough energy to power more than 2 million homes. It also dealt a devastating blow to New Jersey’s economy — thousands of potential clean-energy jobs gone.

Then came the tariffs. In March, the Trump administration imposed a 10% tariff on imported electricity from Canada — a move that immediately drove up prices and rattled confidence in our energy supply. While some tariffs were later rolled back amid political pressure, the pattern of sudden imposition, partial repeal, and renewed threats created a cloud of uncertainty over our electricity markets. This instability disrupts long-term infrastructure planning and leaves ratepayers footing the bill.

Blocking clean-energy projects while propping up fossil fuels and imposing tariffs on electricity from our allies (like Canada) is a recipe for instability and higher costs. That’s exactly what we’re experiencing now and that’s what we will continue to experience under this federal administration.

The data center boom

Meanwhile, electricity demand is skyrocketing, driven not just by natural population growth or seasonal usage during an increasingly warmer summer but by a rapid, under-regulated surge in AI-driven data center development across the PJM region. Data centers now consume 5% of New Jersey’s total electricity — a number expected to more than double by 2030. That spike in demand directly contributed to the sky-high auction prices we’re now paying for.

But here’s the problem: PJM is operating without a clear understanding of how much electricity is being consumed by rapidly expanding AI-driven data centers — or where that demand is most concentrated. This lack of transparency distorts demand forecasts, which leads to inflated capacity prices, and leads to overbuilt, overpriced infrastructure. By failing to collect and share accurate data, PJM is planning in the dark — and we are paying a premium for it.

So what do we do?

First, we need to expand existing programs that help families immediately, because no one should have to choose between keeping the lights on and putting food on the table. Right now, only 20% of eligible New Jerseyans are enrolled in the Universal Service Fund (USF), a program administered by the Department of Community Affairs that provides up to $180 per month to low-income ratepayers. We need to make sure all eligible people are aware of the program while we consider ways to expand it — especially at a time when the Trump administration has gutted the federal Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), creating even more uncertainty and depriving families of the energy assistance they need to stay warm in the winter and cool in the summer.

Meanwhile, PJM must act quicker to approve and connect the existing projects in their queue. PJM must review projects faster, adhere to federal guidelines mandating study deadlines of 150 days, and adopt binding deadlines to cut through red tape. If PJM refuses to fix its broken system, New Jersey must be ready to take bold action — even if that means pursuing an exit from the capacity market entirely. We can’t wait any longer.

At the same time, we must work for more timely remedies that hold PJM accountable for the harm already done. That’s why I support New Jersey’s Division of Rate Counsel in calling on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to order a rerun of PJM’s last capacity auction. The results weren’t just outrageous; they were unjust. PJM’s flawed rules allowed market manipulation, excluded low-cost resources and drove up costs unnecessarily. If FERC intervenes, ratepayers could see over $5 billion in savings. New Jersey families deserve a system that works for them, not for entrenched energy interests.

At the same time, we must modernize our grid so the power lines can carry more electricity. That’s why I’m introducing a legislative package focused on Advanced Transmission Technologies (ATT). These technologies can dramatically increase grid capacity, allowing utilities to deliver more electricity to their customers. The greater availability of energy will help hold down consumer costs. The legislative package will also require utilities to evaluate and integrate these tools in their long-term plans, protect vulnerable ratepayers and streamline permitting to make these upgrades faster and more efficient.

Clean energy is not the problem; it is the solution. Solar, battery storage and smart transmission technologies are the fastest path to long-term energy affordability and independence. They reduce emissions, create jobs, lower prices and prepare the grid for the demands of the 21st century.

The system must change. The success of our economy depends on a state-of-the-art energy infrastructure that meets the demands of the future while lowering costs for working families. Clinging to dirty, inefficient fossil fuels simply won’t cut it. Now is the time to pave the way for affordable energy independence, booming economic growth and a full embrace of our state’s clean-energy potential.

We owe it to every New Jersey family to stop playing politics and start making progress.",https://www.njspotlightnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/123/2025/05/Andrew-Zwicker-16X9.jpg,N,,2025-06-02 02:06:12.144815

From 2020 to 2024, the United States began building the outlines of a serious national industrial strategy.
This moment — where implementation-ready projects are being clawed back midstream — raises a broader question: What happens to regional industrial planning when federal alignment disappears?
They are structural setbacks, undermining the very concept of regional economic governance that these programs were designed to support.
That alignment must not unravel because a federal funding stream has been delayed or redirected.","The U.S. Department of Commerce has rescinded $48 million in funding for the Spokane-Coeur d'Alene aerospace tech hub, a regional initiative already months into implementation. Five other regional projects, including a $44 million life sciences initiative in Birmingham, Ala., saw their previously announced awards pulled.

These were not symbolic projects. They were competitively selected, congressionally authorized under the CHIPS and Science Act, and structured to anchor America’s leadership in critical sectors like semiconductors, aerospace, biotechnology and clean energy. Each hub has a regional strategy, a coalition of partners and a plan to leverage public investment into long-term economic transformation. Now they are being told to reapply under a different set of rules, for a smaller pool of funds and with entirely different evaluation criteria.

From 2020 to 2024, the United States began building the outlines of a serious national industrial strategy. The CHIPS and Science Act, the Inflation Reduction Act and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law were not just funding vehicles. They marked a broader shift: a recognition that free markets alone could not deliver resilient supply chains, regional equity or technological leadership in an era of global competition. What emerged was a place-based model grounded in public investment, regional coordination and strategic sector focus.

The Tech Hubs Program, administered by the Economic Development Administration, exemplified that approach. It asked communities and regions not just to apply for funding but to imagine themselves as global innovation centers. The response was overwhelming — and generative. Regions like Spokane and Birmingham assembled coalitions of universities, small businesses, workforce boards, tribal governments and anchor institutions to design 10-year strategies grounded in production, not just research.

The federal pullback raises the stakes for states and regions, which must now decide whether these coalitions will dissolve or evolve into lasting civic infrastructure. This moment — where implementation-ready projects are being clawed back midstream — raises a broader question: What happens to regional industrial planning when federal alignment disappears? The answer will depend on how local and state actors respond, and whether they treat these coalitions as temporary grant-seeking teams or as permanent civic infrastructure.

That momentum is now under threat. What is being framed as a procedural reset is, in fact, a reversal in values and direction. New funding rules explicitly exclude priorities like equity, labor partnerships or climate resilience. The Good Jobs Principles are gone. References to inclusive workforce pipelines have been removed. Even implementation grants already awarded and publicly announced in January are being recompeted without guarantee of reapproval. Birmingham’s biotech hub — built on collaboration among health systems, historically Black colleges and universities, and emerging biomanufacturing firms — has seen its project placed in limbo just as hiring and infrastructure work was ramping up.

These are not minor adjustments. They are structural setbacks, undermining the very concept of regional economic governance that these programs were designed to support.

The pullback comes at a moment of deep uncertainty in global trade. A patchwork of tariffs, retaliatory measures and shifting import restrictions has re-entered the policy landscape, leaving manufacturers, exporters and local planners with few reliable signals. But tariffs alone cannot secure a national industrial base. They must be paired with deliberate investments, workforce strategies and innovation infrastructure. Without that, we do not have industrial policy — we have industrial improvisation.

Which is why this moment demands leadership, and not just from Washington. Local and regional actors must continue the work they have begun. The coalitions formed through tech hubs and other place-based initiatives were never just vehicles for federal dollars. They are governance structures. They have brought together economic development leaders, university research centers, small and medium-sized businesses that support supply chains, and state agencies around shared long-term plans. That alignment must not unravel because a federal funding stream has been delayed or redirected. It must be deepened and expanded.

Regions should continue convening across sectors, sharing playbooks and aligning supply chain strategies. States must step in where needed with bridge financing and policy consistency. And Congress must act to ensure that competitive, awarded funds cannot be unilaterally withdrawn. Guardrails matter. So does institutional trust.

What is at stake is not just a few regional grants. It is the question of whether the United States can build again — intentionally, inclusively and with strategic clarity. The industrial strategy of the past four years gave us a glimpse of what is possible: onshored semiconductor fabs, biomanufacturing capacity in the South, clean-energy clusters in former coal regions. It showed that growth does not have to be coastal, extractive or zero-sum. And it reminded us that planning — real planning — is a form of power.

If we walk away now, we don’t just abandon funding. We abandon the institutional muscle it took to build these coalitions. We send a signal that industrial policy is conditional and that national strategy ends where partisan cycles begin. But if we stay the course — if we protect the vision and continue the work — the results will endure.

In 2019, the project represented Eni’s first venture into the Australian renewable energy market.

Eni further expanded its presence by acquiring the Batchelor and Manton Dam solar PV power plants in late 2019. These plants, which have a generation capacity of 12.5MW and were completed in 2020, were completed in 2020.

Jacana Energy CEO Rod Hayes said the contracts will increase the share of renewables in the energy mix at a larger scale than previously seen in the Territory.

“At Jacana Energy, we’re about leading smart energy solutions for the Territory. New sources of energy, including renewables, must be brought into the mix where it makes sense,” Hayes said.

“We’re focused on lowering the total costs of the energy system. We’re grateful to Plenitude for their patience under challenging circumstances, and we look forward to continuing to work with them in the future.”

Jacana’s move to secure solar PV energy will likely be welcomed by the broader energy industry in the Northern Territory, as the technology is regarded as one of the cheapest forms of energy generation.

It will also be welcome as a positive spin on the renewable energy transition in the Territory following a turbulent start to the year. Indeed, earlier this year, the Northern Territory government confirmed it would be scrapping the region’s 50% renewables by 2030 target, deeming it “reckless”.

However, solar PV will continue to play an integral role in decarbonising the Territory and ensuring low-cost bills for households and businesses.

For instance, the government is supporting the development of the AU$400 million (US$258 million) Darwin Renewable Energy Hub, which would connect directly to the Darwin-Katherine grid.

The hub involves co-locating up to six large-scale solar PV power plants, capable of generating 180-210MW of renewable energy, alongside a BESS on a single site near existing network infrastructure.

Innovators like Savic Motorcycles are showing that electric transport can be thrilling, stylish, and sustainable.","Australia’s clean energy future isn’t just about where our power comes from, but also how we move. Electric mobility, or e-mobility, is powering ahead, offering smarter, cleaner ways to travel that cut emissions, reduce noise, and fit neatly into our modern lifestyles.

From electric cars to e-scooters and e-bikes, e-mobility is no longer just a buzzword, it’s a genuine shift in the way we think about transport. Right at the forefront of this movement is Savic Motorcycles, an Australian company building head-turning electric motorbikes that are as stylish as they are sustainable.

Let’s unpack how e-mobility fits into Australia’s clean energy story, what it means for our environment, health and way of life, and why brands like Savic are worth watching.

What is e-mobility and why does it matter?

E-mobility refers to electric-powered transport – think electric vehicles (EVs), bikes, scooters, buses and even trucks. These alternatives to internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles are powered by electricity stored in rechargeable batteries, rather than petrol or diesel.

What’s driving the e-mobility trend? Several key factors:

Climate action: Transport is Australia’s third-largest source of emissions. E-mobility helps slash that.

Cost savings: EVs are cheaper to run and maintain over time.

Health benefits: Zero tailpipe emissions mean cleaner air.

Tech appeal: Modern e-vehicles are smart, fast and surprisingly fun to drive or ride.

As more Aussies choose to electrify their commutes, road trips and work vehicles, the demand for charging infrastructure, renewable electricity, and smarter transport planning grows alongside it.

Pros and cons of e-mobility in Australia

Like any shift, going electric isn’t all smooth riding. Let’s break it down.

Pros

Lower emissions: EVs produce up to 70% fewer emissions over their lifetime than ICE vehicles, especially when powered by renewables.

Cheaper to run: Fewer moving parts, less servicing, and electricity is cheaper than fuel.

Energy resilience: E-mobility fits into a decentralised energy system, especially when vehicles can feed power back to the grid.

Better for health: Reduced exhaust fumes improve air quality and reduce respiratory illnesses.

Quiet and clean: No engine noise or petrol smell – a win for city dwellers and suburban streets.

Cons

Upfront cost: EVs and e-bikes still carry a higher sticker price, although rebates are helping.

Charging access: Regional Australia is still catching up on EV infrastructure.

Battery materials: Mining and manufacturing can carry social and environmental impacts, but these are improving.

How e-mobility fits Aussie life

E-mobility is well-suited to the Australian lifestyle. Our love of wide open roads, weekend escapes and daily commutes makes us ideal candidates for electrified transport, particularly as battery range and infrastructure improve.

E-bikes and scooters are perfect for short trips around town or replacing the second car. Families are switching to EVs for school runs and holidays. And e-motorbikes? Well, that’s where style meets sustainability.

Enter Savic Motorcycles: Aussie-made, electric-powered

Featured in Episode 1 of Energy Matters, Savic Motorcycles is leading the electric motorbike revolution in Australia. Founded by engineer Dennis Savic, the company hand-builds high-performance electric motorcycles that look like café racers but hum with futuristic tech.

The Savic C-Series delivers punchy acceleration, a top speed of 160 km/h and a real-world range of around 200 kilometres – more than enough for most weekend rides or city commutes. They’ve taken the grunt and growl of a traditional motorbike and swapped it for instant torque and quiet confidence.

But Savic isn’t just about making a statement. Their bikes are designed for net-zero riders, those who care about performance and the planet. Each model reflects the best of Aussie engineering and design, with the benefit of lower maintenance and zero tailpipe emissions.

Dennis summed up the e-motorbike experience in our recent Road to ZERO podcast:

“You kind of get into this mode when you’re riding – you’re not really thinking about anything else… you’re just gliding through the air.”

What stood out in Energy Matters was Savic’s commitment to local manufacturing and sustainability. They’re not importing bikes and slapping on a logo – they’re building a new standard for two-wheel travel right here on home soil.

Watch our podcast with Dennis Savic and find out more about the C-Series.

Environmental impact: EVs vs ICE vehicles

On average, an EV emits 3–5 times less CO₂ over its life than a petrol vehicle, even when accounting for manufacturing and battery production. When powered by renewables, emissions drop even further.

Motorbikes aren’t always better by default – many ICE motorbikes emit more pollutants per kilometre than cars. So switching to e-motorbikes like Savic’s offers an outsized benefit, especially in urban environments.

Battery recycling is a challenge, but advances in reuse and repurposing are improving outcomes. As the industry matures, the environmental case for e-mobility only gets stronger.

The social and health upside

Cleaner air isn’t just good for the planet – it’s good for people. Reduced air pollution from tailpipes means:

Fewer asthma attacks

Lower cardiovascular disease rates

Reduced noise pollution, improving mental wellbeing

E-mobility also brings social equity benefits. E-scooters and e-bikes offer cheap, accessible transport. Public EV buses reduce noise and fumes in lower-income areas. Over time, electrified transport helps build healthier, fairer cities.

Final thoughts: E-mobility is here, and it’s electric

Australia’s journey to net zero won’t be won in the power station alone – it’s also won on the road. E-mobility is changing how we move, how we live and how we think about energy.

The team at Energy Matters is so excited to see e-mobility taking off in Australia and, even better, with Aussie brands and manufacturers stepping up. Innovators like Savic Motorcycles are showing that electric transport can be thrilling, stylish, and sustainable. The future is pretty exciting! We cannot wait to see what other innovators will step up in this space.

Whether you’re riding a Savic through the city or plugging in your family EV, you’re part of a shift that’s cleaner, quieter and better for all of us. If your daily commute allows for a change, consider riding, scooting, or driving in or on an electric alternative.",https://www.energymatters.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/The-Role-of-E-mobility-in-Australias-Clean-Energy-Future.png,N,,2025-06-02 00:02:10.833723

But homeowner interest is surging,"Brian Sharp, www.wxxinews.org, brian-sharp",,,,,https://www.wxxinews.org/2025-06-01/erosion-of-solar-incentives-could-upend-major-rochester-projects-but-homeowner-interest-is-surging,"A possible rollback of federal incentives for solar and other clean energy technologies threatens to derail the project before it starts.
Schulte called it “worse than my worst-case scenario.” The deadline for companies to respond to the city’s request for rooftop solar proposals is Friday.
Plans are for a chosen company “to finance, design, install, own, maintain and operate rooftop solar” on the three downtown buildings, and possibly the terminal building at the Port of Rochester in Charlotte.
“This is a go-big-or-go-home moment,” said Noah Ginsburg, executive director with the New York Solar Energy Industries Association, a trade group representing the state’s rooftop and community solar industry.
The city of Rochester has two small-sized rooftop solar systems, one on the Arnett branch library and the other at the Public Market.","Solar panels could soon help power Blue Cross Arena, the downtown convention center and the city’s Public Safety Building.

Or not.

A possible rollback of federal incentives for solar and other clean energy technologies threatens to derail the project before it starts. Such action also would undercut other major investments, including GreenSpark Solar’s plan to build a new 4½-story headquarters north of downtown.

“We're going to need a home, and I intend for it to be that building,” GreenSpark CEO Kevin Schulte said. ""I don't know when the time will be to pull the plug or not.”

Recent action, or inaction, at the federal and state level has clouded the future of the growing industry – spurred on by government incentives encouraging investment by consumers and providers alike.

President Donald Trump and his administration have sought to undo much of his predecessor’s clean energy agenda. Trump has mocked solar farms as “ridiculous.” And a House spending bill approved last month would rapidly phase out tax credits for solar, wind and electric vehicles.

The solar credits allow businesses to deduct 30% of new system costs from their federal taxes.

“I think that this version of the bill is worse than what people had anticipated,” said Anne Spaulding, the city’s manager of environmental quality.

Schulte called it “worse than my worst-case scenario.”

The deadline for companies to respond to the city’s request for rooftop solar proposals is Friday.

Plans are for a chosen company “to finance, design, install, own, maintain and operate rooftop solar” on the three downtown buildings, and possibly the terminal building at the Port of Rochester in Charlotte. The city would commit to buying all of the electricity that is generated.

“We don't know ... what the developers are, how they're going to react, and what type of proposals we're going to receive,” Spaulding said. “So we'll just have to wait and see.”

There had been an expectation that Biden-era clean energy incentives would be cut ever since the November election.

Solar, wind and battery storage accounted for 93% of new energy that came online last year, according to The American Clean Power Association. The threat of losing those benefits has led to a surge in business as homeowners and others rush to do installations and claim the federal tax credits – which can translate to a $8,000 to $9,000 savings for a typical homeowner.

“We've actually beat our residential solar sales goals for the year so far, and we have a lot of interest in our commercial business as well,” said Schulte, who is booked into the fall. “But, you know, when we go into 2026, the forecast is just going to be different.”

The House bill would eliminate tax credits for residential rooftop solar and battery storage at the end of 2025. Most larger projects would need to start construction within 60 days of the enactment of the bill, and be put in service by Dec. 31, 2028.

Many, including Schulte, had looked to New York state to fill the gap.

For starters, solar advocates hoped surplus funds in the NY-Sun program would be used to expand investment. Instead, most of it got reallocated this spring to other energy efficiency measures. And while the newly adopted state budget included a dedicated $1 billion climate action fund – focused on a shift toward electrification – a proposal to expand the residential solar tax credit was left out.

“Are they making it harder to make this kind of investment?” Schulte asked. “Yeah, they sure are.”

Schulte joined other solar advocates last week at the state capitol building in Albany to rally support for what’s called the ASAP act – or Accelerate Solar for Affordable Power. It’s a bill that would redouble the state’s support for growing solar capacity across New York.

“This is a go-big-or-go-home moment,” said Noah Ginsburg, executive director with the New York Solar Energy Industries Association, a trade group representing the state’s rooftop and community solar industry. ""We need the New York state Legislature to go big.”

All this unfolded in roughly a month’s time – as Schulte moved his employees and equipment from Ontario, Wayne County, into temporary space in downtown Rochester, anticipating the new headquarters. And the city put out its request for rooftop solar proposals.

The city buildings were chosen for the large open roof spaces unobstructed by tree cover. Each has high electricity usage, and “they’re very visible,” Spaulding said.

“So it's kind of a visible statement of our commitment to sustainability in the city,” she said.

The city’s project outline emphasizes that point, stating that beyond expected taxpayer savings from reduced electricity costs, the hope is to “encourage other municipalities, commercial entities, non-profit organizations, and residents to consider installing solar.”

To further that effort, and “to enhance public education,” the city document states, “each facility with rooftop solar installed must have a display describing the project and showing in real time the quantity of renewable energy generated by the solar system and the associated impacts of that generation.”

An increasing number of communities and government agencies have been installing solar panels on public buildings. Louisville, Kentucky, placed panels on a fire station, branch library and community center last year. San Antonio, Texas, is working on solar installations at 42 sites, including rooftop and parking facilities.

The city of Rochester has two small-sized rooftop solar systems, one on the Arnett branch library and the other at the Public Market. A third is planned for the future Maplewood Nature Center. And, back in 2017, the city installed a 2-megawatt solar field on the former Emerson Street landfill, helping to power City Hall and the city’s operations center on Mt. Read Boulevard.

When it comes to the city’s latest and largest rooftop project, GreenSpark’s Schulte said, “we have every intention of winning the bid to put up those projects.”

“Becoming unoptimistic is not going to be my strong suit as a business leader. If I end up being Captain Ahab and going down with the ship, I will,” he said.

“The reality for us is the Earth is still baking. The grid still has constraints. We still have work to do, and we will find a way to do it – whether the government of the state of New York or the federal government support us or not.”",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0b55fc1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4000x2100+0+450/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fc7%2Fbc%2F9cea33864733af3b9c649cfd74b3%2Fsolar-farm-10.jpg,N,,2025-06-02 01:02:16.739057

The global debate over China’s so-called renewable energy “overcapacity” has grown increasingly heated, largely driven by policymakers in the United States and the European Union. This criticism is puzzling: for over a decade, leaders around the world, including from the West, have called for exactly the kind of rapid green expansion China is now delivering.

“Let’s stop subsidising fossil fuels and start supporting the renewables revolution.” That has been the battle cry at nearly every major forum I have attended, from the UN and the World Bank, to the World Economic Forum, since the late 2000s.

Despite these calls, western governments have been slow to ramp up their green industries. Some western car companies even chose to cheat on emissions targets rather than accelerate the shift to electric vehicles (EVs). We in the west should take a long, honest look in the mirror before blaming China for doing exactly what we called for.

From criticism to collaboration

For developing countries, cheap Chinese solar panels mean that, for the first time in global history, there is a green path to prosperity. Historically, countries – starting with the United Kingdom during the industrial revolution – built their economies on fossils fuels, mainly coal. But today, solar power is cheaper than coal in key markets such as China, the US, India and Germany. A developing nation can now save money by switching from coal to solar, facilitating economic growth without assistance from richer nations. Over the past decade, the price of solar energy has fallen by nearly 90%. No one predicted this, and even fewer thought it feasible. This transformation has been driven by fierce competition among leading Chinese solar companies, including Tongwei, Longi, Trina, Jinco and Ja.

When Janet Yellen, US treasury secretary under the Biden administration, described Chinese government subsidies as contributing to excess production and undermining global market resilience, she overlooked the reality of global demand. During recent economically challenging times for China, few industries have remained as attractive to investors as clean energy. Business leaders have closely monitored the sector’s rapid growth, especially in solar production. From a global demand perspective, we face green under-capacity, not overcapacity. As long as products were expensive, demand remained naturally low, but now, with scale, costs have come down and demand continues to rise.

Chinese companies have undoubtedly benefited from the government’s green strategies. However, their investments and expansion are grounded in careful assessments of both domestic and international markets. When Chinese products succeed at home and abroad, the term “overcapacity” becomes irrelevant. On the contrary, there is an urgent need for even greater green investment and stronger demand globally.

China does not suffer from “overcapacity”; rather, it possesses productive capabilities that can greatly benefit the world. The country’s green industrial revolution offers unprecedented opportunities for global climate action. So instead of viewing China’s leadership in green industries as a threat, other countries should recognise it as a powerful engine accelerating the global energy transition – and step up to compete with it.

A global green pathway

Regions like Southeast Asia urgently need pathways to sustainable economic growth. China’s remarkable expansion in solar and EV sectors has been primarily driven by significant technological innovation, which has dramatically reduced costs in response to rising global demand.

A recent visit to Nepal strongly reinforced this viewpoint. The streets of Kathmandu were bustling with electric vehicles, placing Nepal alongside Norway and China as global leaders in EV adoption. Chinese EV dealerships line the city’s main avenues, offering affordable yet advanced technology, powered entirely by domestic hydropower. Replacing imported oil with domestic green energy is a triple win for Nepal: it reduces pollution, combats climate change and frees up funds that could be better spent on health or education.

According to the United Nations, developing countries require approximately USD 1.7 trillion annually in renewable energy investment, yet only USD 544 billion was invested globally in 2022. Far from having too much renewable energy capacity, we urgently need more affordable solutions to bridge this significant investment gap. Renewables must become abundant and cheap enough to silence the outdated “drill, baby, drill” mindset.

As Harvard economist Dani Rodrik puts it: “A glut in renewables and green products is precisely what the climate doctor ordered.”

In Indonesia, collaboration between China’s Trina Solar and local partners has led to the construction of one of Southeast Asia’s largest solar manufacturing plants. This USD 100 million facility has not only created hundreds of local jobs, but has also swiftly advanced Indonesia’s transition to clean energy.

Similarly, Chinese EV plants in Indonesia, Thailand, Türkiye, Uzbekistan, Brazil and many other developing countries are driving industrial upgrading and technology transfer. These partnerships clearly illustrate how China’s vast renewable capacity can empower developing economies, fostering shared prosperity rather than dependency.

Navigating legitimate concerns

Nevertheless, we must also carefully address legitimate concerns. Leaders in both developing and developed countries have shared apprehensions with me about becoming overly reliant on Chinese clean technology, which could potentially stifle local manufacturing and create long-term trade imbalances. These are valid points. It is only natural and necessary that heads of state prioritise jobs for their own citizens.

The solution lies not in protectionism, but in expanding international cooperation

The solution lies not in protectionism, but in expanding international cooperation. Through meaningful technology transfers, local manufacturing partnerships and capacity-building efforts, China can help other nations develop their own green industries and avoid one-sided reliance while advancing a more equitable global transition.

We need far greater global investment from Chinese clean-tech leaders – from EV and battery giants like BYD and CATL, to renewable energy companies such as Goldwind, Envision, China Three Gorges and all the major solar manufacturers. Last year, Tongwei alone produced more solar cells than the entire historical output of all but five nations. CATL and BYD now dominate the most critical component of the green revolution: electric batteries.

Parallels with global giants like Apple and Samsung help illustrate this point. Apple became the world’s most valuable company by efficiently supplying markets far beyond the US. Likewise, Samsung’s global leadership would have been impossible if it relied solely on its small domestic market in South Korea. Both companies operate with huge “overcapacity” – a key reason why the world has been able to buy their products.

Similarly, China’s renewable energy industry thrives precisely because it serves global markets, not just domestic demand.

China should export more EVs and batteries, build more solar and wind plants, and construct more high-speed rail systems and 5G networks as these technologies are essential to help meet urgent global demand. At the same time, this should be based on mutually agreed trade practices, and nations should legitimately expect technology transfer.

When I visited CATL’s headquarters in Ningde, southern China, it was discussed at length how instrumental BMW had been in the company’s rise. The German carmaker was a demanding customer, sharing best practices and technologies that helped shape CATL’s development. Today, CATL is a global leader and now it, too, should share its technology with the world, including Germany.

It remains unclear what impact trade wars will have on the green transition. Such conflicts make us all poorer and stall urgently needed innovation. There is, however, no indication that China, Europe, India or indeed any other major power will follow the US down this path. They are unlikely to embrace trade wars or slow the momentum of the green transformation. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi recently expressed the opposite view, declaring that India can now combine economic growth with ecological responsibility, growing its economy while protecting Mother Earth.

Over time, both the public and businesses in the US will act as counterweights to trade war policies. Companies like Ford and General Motors understand that the future of cars is electric. If they allow themselves to be confined to a domestic market of gasoline SUVs shaped by Trump, they will be the big losers in this technological revolution. Chinese companies will simply capture the global market. After all, no monarch in history could force people to ride horses once cars and trains had been invented.

Ultimately, true climate leadership today is not just about being a manufacturing hub; it is about becoming a committed partner in global development. The urgent transition to a green economy requires tools, technology, financing and expertise – resources China possesses in abundance. But delivering products alone is not enough. China must offer comprehensive solutions tailored to local contexts, creating jobs and opportunities where they are most needed.

The vibrant streets of Kathmandu, filled with EVs, represent not only Nepal’s progress, but also a vision for a greener future across Asia – the continent home to 60% of the world’s population. Rather than erecting barriers or fearing competition, nations should embrace collaboration, drawing on China’s industrial strengths to meet critical global climate goals. The task ahead demands creativity, international cooperation and a shared commitment to a sustainable future. Far from being “overcapacity”, China’s renewable energy potential should be seen as one of our greatest global opportunities.

Besides the Advanced Clean Trucks rule, Congress also revoked waivers for California’s Advanced Clean Cars II rule and its Heavy-Duty Engine Omnibus NOx rule.
Turning the clock back on both cleaner combustion engine requirements and zero-emission technology is an attack on clean air,” Randolph said.

Besides the Advanced Clean Trucks rule, Congress also revoked waivers for California’s Advanced Clean Cars II rule and its Heavy-Duty Engine Omnibus NOx rule.

Under the Clean Air Act of 1970, California’s emissions regulator, the California Air Resources Board, CARB, must request and receive an EPA waiver for each state regulation that exceeds federal standards.

The Advanced Clean Trucks rule is a manufacturers sales requirement for zero emission vehicles and a one-time reporting requirement for large fleets. It would require the majority of Class 8 big-rigs sold in California to be zero-emission vehicles by 2035.

The Advanced Clean Cars II regulations take the state’s growing zero-emission vehicle market and robust motor vehicle emission control rules and augments them to meet more aggressive tailpipe emissions standards and ramp up to 100 percent zero-emission vehicles. By 2035 all new passenger cars, trucks and SUVs sold in California will be zero emissions, says CARB.

The EPA’s California waiver for the Advanced Clean Cars II regs allows California, and the 11 other states that have opted to follow California’s lead on these regs, to require that all new passenger vehicles sold by 2035 be zero emission. Together, these states represent roughly 40 percent of new vehicle registrations in the United States.

On December 18, 2024, in the last weeks of President Joe Biden’s term, EPA granted formal federal approval of California’s NOx regulation for heavy-duty vehicles. California and adopting states can now enforce the record-low NOx and particulate matter standards for medium- and heavy-duty engines and vehicles.

But automakers insist that these goals are not feasible.

On May 21, the U.S.-based Alliance for Automotive Innovation, representing 44 car and truck manufacturers from around the world, released a statement by its President and CEO John Bozzella.

“The fact is these EV sales mandates were never achievable,” Bozzella declared after the Senate reversed the EPA’s approval of a waiver to California and 11 states to ban the sale of gas-powered vehicles by 2035 under the Advanced Clean Cars II regs.

“Automakers warned federal and state policymakers that reaching these EV sales targets would take a miracle, especially in the coming years when the mandates get exponentially tougher,” he said.

“There’s a significant gap between the marketplace and these EV sales requirements. In reality, meeting the mandates would require diverting finite capital from the EV transition to purchase compliance credits from Tesla. This doesn’t help EV adoption or build charging infrastructure but does create a domino effect leading to job and manufacturing losses, higher auto prices and fewer vehicle choices,” Bozzella said.

The Advanced Clean Trucks rule has been adopted in other states as encouraging a quicker transition to electric trucks than that set by the federal government. Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, and Washington incorporated the requirements in the 2025 model year, according to the RV Industry Association.

“By the way, the problem really isn’t California. It’s the 11 states that adopted California’s rules without the same level of readiness for EV sales requirements of this magnitude,” he said. “The Senate (and the House before it) deserve enormous credit. Instead of kicking the can down the road or waiting for regulatory failure and its consequences, they voted to restore a degree of balance to U.S. vehicle emissions regulations.

“The auto industry has invested billions in electrification and has 144 electrified models on the market right now. Again, the concerns were about the mandate – not the technology. You can be against the ACC II EV mandates (we were) and believe that transportation is trending toward a range of electrified products like battery electric vehicles, hybrids and plug-in hybrids (it is),” Bozzella said. “That’s what balance looks like. And balance is not only good for consumers, but essential for the U.S. auto industry to remain healthy and globally competitive.”

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin was pleased with the Congressional resolutions. “We are glad to see that Congress recognized the truth, that EPA’s California waivers are rules that would create a negative impact on all Americans by driving up costs while limiting consumer choice, and acted accordingly,” he said. “This action, once signed by President Trump, not only prevents California from implementing their attempt at EV mandate actions but ensures that they can never do something similar again.”

But Chair of the California Air Resources Board, Liane Randolph, called the Congressional resolutions “unconstitutional, illegal and foolish,” in a statement following the vote. She promised more action in the coming days and said the state agency would continue working with truck manufacturers on zero-emissions vehicles.

“California will pursue every available remedy to challenge these actions and defend our right to protect the public from dangerous air pollution. Turning the clock back on both cleaner combustion engine requirements and zero-emission technology is an attack on clean air,” Randolph said.

Certification for the 2026 model year is already well underway, said Steven Cliff, PhD, CARB Executive Officer, in a statement. “Assuming the disputed resolutions are signed by the President, CARB will continue to accept and process certification applications for model year 2026. This is necessary to provide certainty to affected parties and consumers, provide consistent treatment of regulated entities, maintain stability in the market, facilitate meeting the commitments of the Clean Truck Partnership, ensure the requirements of certification are met to enable lawful vehicle sales in California under [the] Health and Safety Code…” Cliff explained at length.

California will fight to keep its ability to win waivers from the EPA that allow the state to impose stricter emissions standards than the national ones. The state has some of the highest levels of pollution in the country, especially in dense urban areas such as Los Angeles and the Central Valley.

Saying the waiver revocations are a move that will “Make America Smoggy Again,” Governor Gavin Newsom and Attorney General Rob Bonta announced that the state will file a lawsuit challenging the Congressional resolutions.

The Clean Air Act authorizes only the federal government to regulate emissions from new motor vehicles and expressly preempts states from adopting or enforcing competing emissions regulations. The State of California is the lone exception.

The EPA has granted waivers over the decades as California has demonstrated its need for stricter-than-federal standards based on heavy smog that collects in the Los Angeles Basin and the Central Valley, according to the California Air Resources Board, which says, this is still the case.

“California has a serious smog problem, exacerbated by climate change, and still needs stricter-thanfederal standards to address it and many other climate and air quality issues. In fact, air quality in many parts of the state faces major threats as climate change worsens, leading to more smog, more wildfires, and increased risk. Climate change itself poses a severe threat to Californians,” CARB explains.

Air pollution in California today has improved under the state’s stricter emissions standards, but CARB says, “California’s unique geography means air quality goals still require continued progress on vehicle emissions. Seven of the 10 cities with the worst air pollution nationwide are in California. Ten million Californians in the San Joaquin Valley and Los Angeles air basins currently live under what is known as “severe nonattainment” conditions for ozone.”

“People in these areas suffer unusually high rates of asthma and cardiopulmonary disease. Zero-emission vehicles are a critical part of the plan to protect Californians,” CARB maintains.

“Climate change makes air quality worse and poses many other threats to Californians. It is already increasing the number of hot days that can result in smog events, impacting precipitation and snowpack, and exacerbating wildfires,” the state ageency warns.

“California’s geography – with its population in deep valleys, along the rising sea, and in fire-prone forests, makes the state especially climate vulnerable,” CARB states on its website. “In the future, sea level rise will imperil the coast, and hotter temperatures statewide will lead to higher levels of pollution in our cities.”

California argues that it has demonstrated that its standards are feasible, and that auto manufacturers have enough lead time to develop the technology to meet them. It has done so for every waiver it has submitted. The greenhouse gas and zero-emission electric vehicle standards underwent a midterm review that confirmed that the industry was on track.

“In a massive handout to special interests, the Senate today took a radical action that creates enormous policy uncertainty for the entire transportation industry,” said John Boesel, president and CEO of Calstart, an industry organization focused on transportation decarbonization.

“This move concedes the industries of the future to global competitors, will increase air pollution, accelerate global warming and result in significant job loss,” he said.

“This vote upends decades of policy that has successfully resulted in cleaner air and the growth of a robust clean transportation industry. It is a brazen, yet futile, attempt to bring the clean transportation industry to a sudden halt,” Boesel alleged. “Calstart will continue to partner with the states working to fill this gaping void left by today’s federal action.”

Republicans Originated the California Waiver

The California waiver was established by Republicans at both the state and federal levels. Since 1970 when Ronald Reagan as Governor of California initially requested the waiver authority from the federal government, and President Richard Nixon signed the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1970, granting California waiver authority, the state has used its own air quality needs to lead the country toward cleaner air.

Granting a California waiver has nationwide consequences. Regulatory requirements in California, the most populous state, can affect markets nationwide. Once the EPA issues a waiver to California, other states can adopt the California standards as their own. To date, 17 states and Washington, DC, have opted in to standards for light-duty vehicles and 10 have done so for heavy-duty vehicles.

The automakers argue that this move could undermine the country's push for cleaner, zero-emission transportation.

EV Makers Advocate for Pure Electric Solutions

In letters to the Ministry of Heavy Industries, companies like Tata Motors and Mahindra & Mahindra have urged the government to limit incentives and policy support strictly to fully electric vehicles.

They contend that hybrids, which combine internal combustion engines with electric propulsion, still rely on fossil fuels and produce tailpipe emissions, albeit lower than conventional vehicles. This reliance, they argue, could derail the momentum and investments dedicated to EV development, especially with India’s ambitions to scale EV adoption.

""Our plea is for government policy and incentives to stay firmly focused only on EVs,"" Mahindra stated in its correspondence to the ministry.

Policy Uncertainty and Investment Risks

The potential shift in policy has raised concerns about creating confusion among car buyers, companies, and investors. With only 5,384 of the 847,544 government fleet vehicles being EVs in 2022, the opportunity for EV growth is significant. However, support for hybrids could introduce policy uncertainty, deter critical investment, and impact India's global image as an investor-friendly destination.

Tata Motors, which has raised substantial capital for its EV push, emphasised that the commission's move could undermine current and proposed EV investments. The company highlighted the importance of a consistent and predictable policy environment to attract long-term investors, particularly in high-capex, technology-intensive sectors like EVs.

Diverging Industry Perspectives

The opposition from EV manufacturers also pits them against hybrid advocates like Toyota and Maruti Suzuki. These companies have been promoting hybrids as a practical solution to reduce emissions, especially in regions with inadequate charging infrastructure. The debate underscores a key policy divergence in India's automotive strategy, with different stakeholders advocating for varying approaches to achieve cleaner transportation.

States Add Complexity to the Policy Mix

Adding to the complexity, some Indian states have taken steps that favour hybrid vehicles. For instance, Uttar Pradesh has decided to maintain a waiver on registration taxes for hybrid cars, a decision beneficial to Toyota but unfavourable to Tata Motors and Mahindra & Mahindra. Similarly, Karnataka plans to implement tax waivers and financial incentives to promote the clean mobility sector, including a significant tax cut for hybrid cars.

Tata And Mahindra On Why Betting on EVs Alone is the Right Move

India does not have the luxury of time or the financial leeway to hedge its bets across too many parallel technologies. Supporting strong hybrids may appear practical, but it risks diverting attention and resources from the long-term goal of full electrification.

Unlike EVs, hybrids still burn fossil fuels and contribute to tailpipe emissions. Their existence prolongs dependence on a fuel supply chain India largely imports, weakening the country’s energy security ambitions.

More importantly, hybrids are a stopgap technology whose window of relevance is fast closing. Many developed countries are already transitioning from hybrids to pure EVs. If India chooses to support hybrids today, it risks building an ecosystem that may become obsolete within a decade.

The focus instead should be on scaling charging infrastructure, localising battery manufacturing, and incentivising cleaner grid energy — efforts that will directly strengthen EV adoption.

The argument isn't that hybrids have no place, but that government fleets, meant to set an example, must prioritise zero-emission vehicles. A decisive push for EVs sends a clearer, stronger message, both to consumers and to the industry. The time to double down on electrification is now, not later. Hybrids belong in the past. India’s future should be unapologetically electric.",https://cdn.cartoq.com/photos/052025/mahindra_tata_govt_hybrid_cars_purchase_opposition_featured_9f0637e9d2.jpg,N,,2025-06-02 01:02:22.405310

In April, The New York Times reported on a global drop in sales for Tesla — and now, more specific elements of that drop are coming into focus, along with the companies that stand to benefit from Tesla’s issues.

Among the emerging winners in the EV market is GM, who recently displaced Tesla as the top EV seller in Canada for the first quarter of 2025. Writing at Electrek, Peter Johnson has more on the news, including that the electric versions of the Chevrolet Equinox and Silverado were the two top-selling EVs from the company for the quarter.

“The entire Cadillac portfolio grew by 63.5 per cent, compared to first quarter 2024, our trucks and midsize SUVs continue to lead the competition, and more new customers are choosing GM electric vehicles for performance and affordability,” said GM Canada’s Vice President for Sales, Service and Marketing, Shane Peever, in a statement.

There are some other good reasons for GM’s rise to the top of Canada’s EV sales charts. One of them has to do with Canadian governmental policy — like its neighbor to the south, Canada has restricted the sales of Chinese EVs from companies like BYD. There’s also the fact that Tesla hasn’t exactly given buyers a lot of new options to choose from recently, Cybertruck aside — and the Cybertruck is the kind of vehicle that isn’t designed to get a neutral reaction.","https://www.insidehook.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/gm-ev.jpg?resize=1200,800",N,,2025-06-02 01:02:36.082775

HÀ NỘI — Việt Nam's energy transition presents challenges in the years ahead, but it also offers clear opportunities to establishing stable and long-term foundations for a sustainable economic future.

The challenges include the need for advanced digital and AI technologies, robust energy storage systems and substantial upgrades to grid infrastructure, in order to manage the increased load from renewable energy sources.

Speaking with Việt Nam News on the sidelines of a recent high-level technical seminar, Tok Kian Seng, head of Section for Offshore Infrastructure SEA & Japan, Energy Systems APAC at DNV, pointed out the challenges in the energy transition process.

Many countries also face obstacles in upgrading and expanding their grid systems to accommodate more renewable energy sources while maintaining a stable balance between supply and demand, he said.

Trần Hoài Trang, deputy director general of the Electricity Regulatory Authority under the Ministry of Industry and Trade, said that energy plays a pivotal role in laying the groundwork for Việt Nam’s socio-economic development.

Resolution No. 55 of the Politburo on the national energy development strategy to 2030, with a vision towards 2045, said that energy supply, particularly electricity, has broadly met the demands of economic and social growth.

However, the energy sector still faces considerable limitations, he said at the seminar titled 'Supporting Việt Nam’s Energy Transition Journey', co-organised by the Electricity Regulatory Authority and the Norwegian Embassy in Hà Nội.

Ensuring national energy security remains a pressing issue, as domestic supply sources fall short and reliance on imported energy continues to rise, he said.

Thus, developing renewable energy, especially wind power and solar power, is an inevitable direction, in line with the country's potential and strengths and the world's development trends.

Opportunities

Despite global investment in energy projects showing signs of decline, the Asia–Pacific region, (including Việt Nam), is expected to maintain stable demand for large-scale energy infrastructure, said the APAC Offshore Wind Segment Lead at DNV Energy Systems, Zhang Minghui.

Offshore wind power in the region is evolving. The APAC market is not just expected to overtake other markets but also evolving to keep up with the trends such as energy security, he said.

In Việt Nam, the revised National Power Development Plan VIII (PDP8), approved on April 15, 2025 via Decision No. 768/QĐ-TTg, marks a bold turning point in the country’s energy strategy to 2050.

The plan clearly outlines a shift away from coal, instead prioritising the development of renewable energy, energy storage, nuclear power and emerging fuels such as green ammonia and hydrogen.

With an estimated offshore wind potential of 600GW, the highest in Southeast Asia, Việt Nam is positioning itself as a regional leader in clean energy.

The plan sets ambitious targets, including 6 to 17GW of offshore wind capacity by 2035, alongside major investments in grid infrastructure and battery storage.

Việt Nam is also strengthening its role in the regional supply chain, especially in manufacturing offshore substations and foundation structures.

There is vast potential for offshore wind development in Việt Nam due to its long coastline and consistent wind speeds, ideal conditions for offshore wind projects, Tok added.

According to Tok, digital technologies are key to the energy transition.

They can significantly improve efficiency, reduce costs and minimise environmental impacts.

Tools such as predictive maintenance and real-time monitoring enable strategic decision-making, while AI offers valuable insights for navigating system uncertainties.

Energy companies should embrace innovation through digital transformation while managing cybersecurity risks with structured diligence frameworks like SeSAM, he said.

DNV provides advisory, assurance and risk management services.

“We will leverage our global advantages together with local resources to tackle challenges and unlock new opportunities, in order to accelerate the progress of energy transition together.

“So we look forward to be the trusted partner for Việt Nam to achieve a sustainable and resilient energy of future,” he said.

Solutions

Senior Vice President - Special Projects at DNV Energy Systems, Jeffrey Lim, pointed out five key solutions to advance the energy transition in the Asia-Pacific region.

The first solution is to increase investment in renewable technologies such as solar and wind. The second solution is to scale up the deployment of energy storage systems.

Another solution is to strengthen carbon credit pricing mechanisms, including carbon taxes and emissions trading schemes.

Enhancing international cooperation and financial support for clean energy projects was one of the solutions, he said.

The fifth solution is to develop stable, technology-neutral policies that enable fair competition among all energy sources.

Meanwhile, Zhang emphasised the decisive role of collaboration, not only within regional supply chains but also through knowledge transfer and digital integration.

“The lessons learnt from other regions are important as well - not just about sharing of new technologies but also about embracing digitalisation,” he added.

Ambassador of Norway to Việt Nam, Hilde Solbakken, stressed the importance of a well-defined Government framework for innovation and research and development.

In Norway, a key role of the Government in achieving the green energy transition is to provide the framework for innovation, research and development, including also some finance instruments for the private sector.

“But it is the private sector that will be able to find the actual solutions and implement them, and not least to make them cost-effective,” she said.

Trang, from the Electricity Regulatory Authority, said to firm up the Party and State’s policies on renewable energy development, the ministry has advised on the content of reports submitted to the Prime Minister for presentation to the National Assembly regarding the promulgation of the Law on Electricity.

In November 2024, the Government and the ministry issued a number of subordinate legal documents to finalise key policies for the power and renewable energy sectors, particularly with regard to offshore wind power, paving the way for large-scale deployment of renewable energy projects in the near future.

Additionally, the ministry actively coordinated with other ministries, sectors and local authorities to implement the drafting of Power Development Plan VIII.

The plan prioritises the vigorous promotion of clean, green energy sources, aims to minimise environmental impact and gradually reduce the negative effects of climate change, he said.

It is underpinned by a strategic vision to fully harness the nation’s potential and advantages in energy development, with a special emphasis on renewable energy across three core objectives of meeting domestic energy demand, facilitating the direct power purchase mechanism, and supporting electricity exports.

The revised plan puts forward 11 groups of solutions, with several key measures highlighted.

Firstly, it proposes the continued improvement of mechanisms and policies to establish a clear and enabling legal corridor for the implementation of power projects.

Secondly, it calls for regular engagement with local authorities to support and facilitate power project developers in ensuring that implementation proceeds according to schedule.

Thirdly, the plan advocates for diversifying funding sources and mobilisation channels, ranging from Government and banking finance to aid capitals.

It also seeks to attract both domestic and foreign investment, encouraging broad participation across economic sectors in the energy industry.

“With synchronous solutions from management methods of power development and project implementation, I believe that investors will have enough legal framework to implement power projects in general, renewable energy projects in particular, contributing to the implementation of Việt Nam's Energy Development Strategy,” Trang added.

As China boldly moves forward with the Xinghuo hybrid reactor, the world watches with anticipation.","China has recently unveiled its groundbreaking ambition to construct the world’s first hybrid fusion-fission nuclear plant, named Xinghuo, meaning “spark” in Mandarin. This innovation marks a significant leap in the realm of energy production, potentially igniting a technological revolution with far-reaching economic and geopolitical implications. The hybrid nature of Xinghuo, combining both fusion and fission reactions, promises to maximize energy output while minimizing radioactive waste, setting a new benchmark in nuclear power efficiency and sustainability. As the world eagerly watches China’s ambitious endeavor, the implications for global energy dynamics are profound.

The Science Behind Fusion and Fission

At the core of current nuclear power technology is fission, a process that involves splitting heavy atomic nuclei such as uranium to release energy. In contrast, fusion is the reaction that powers our sun, where two lighter atomic nuclei combine to form a heavier nucleus, releasing a massive amount of energy in the process. Fusion, in theory, can produce four times more energy per kilogram of fuel compared to fission, making it an incredibly efficient energy source.

The unique feature of the Xinghuo plant is its ability to merge these two reactions. The high-energy neutrons produced by the fusion process are used to initiate fission in surrounding materials, creating a self-sustaining cycle that maximizes energy production. This dual-stage reactor system is ingeniously designed to utilize every particle to its fullest potential, potentially revolutionizing how we harness nuclear energy.

Financial and Technical Ambitions

The Xinghuo project comes with a hefty price tag of approximately $2.7 billion, aiming for a continuous production capacity of 100 megawatts. Although this output is akin to a small nuclear reactor, Xinghuo’s ambition lies in achieving a Q factor greater than 30. The Q factor is a measure of the ratio of energy produced to energy consumed in heating the plasma. For comparison, the ITER project in France is targeting a Q of 10, while recent achievements in the U.S. boast a Q of 1.5. Such ambitious goals underscore China’s determination to lead in next-generation nuclear technology.

The plant will be constructed on Yaohu Island in Jiangxi province, an area rich in copper resources essential for the superconducting cables needed in plasma confinement. This strategic location aligns with China’s vision to integrate scientific advancement with resource availability, ensuring the project’s success and sustainability.

Environmental Considerations and Strategic Positioning

Before the Xinghuo plant can begin operations, it must pass a comprehensive environmental impact assessment. This evaluation will include analyses of air and water quality, noise emissions, and the potential impact on local ecosystems. Moreover, the report will feature a risk management plan and long-term monitoring strategy, reflecting the project’s commitment to adhering to public opinion and health standards.

If construction proceeds as planned, China could connect its hybrid plant to the power grid by 2030, potentially outpacing the ITER project, which aims for an operational date of 2035 at the earliest. This strategic advancement not only positions China as a leader in nuclear innovation but also challenges other nations to accelerate their efforts in clean energy technology.

China’s Broader Energy Strategy

China’s energy strategy extends beyond the Xinghuo project, as it concurrently develops the China Fusion Engineering Test Reactor in Hefei, focusing solely on fusion technology. This initiative could propel China to the forefront of nuclear energy innovation, offering a pragmatic and less bureaucratic alternative to projects like ITER.

China’s energy consumption is immense, and as the world’s largest energy consumer, the country is rapidly transitioning from coal to renewable and nuclear energy sources. By 2030, China plans to install 1,720 gigawatts of solar and wind capacity, surpassing its initial targets. The nation also aims to increase its natural gas demand and achieve 20% non-fossil energy consumption by 2025, with a goal of carbon neutrality by 2060. Investments in energy storage and green hydrogen further support this ambitious transition.

As China boldly moves forward with the Xinghuo hybrid reactor, the world watches with anticipation. This project not only represents a technological milestone but also raises questions about the future of global energy leadership. How will other nations respond to China’s advancements in nuclear technology, and what role will hybrid energy systems play in the global pursuit of sustainable power?

However, both countries boosted their coal power capacity over the same period.
Additionally, some of China’s new coal capacity additions are flexible USC coal plants, able to operate at rates as low as 30% utilization, giving priority to RE.
Any attempt to build out RE to replace coal power plants faces regulatory difficulties, including procurement and tariff mechanism challenges.
Ember notes that 26.8GW of new coal capacity could be added by 2031, and captive coal capacity could reach 31.5GW.","Asia, the world’s largest continent, is home to the biggest fleet of coal plants, burning the most carbon-intensive fossil fuel.

China, Japan, South Korea, and Indonesia, housing more than a quarter of the global population, have all increased coal power capacity since 2020. Their additions account for 57% of the world’s 2024 coal-fired capacity of 2,143 gigawatts (GW). China alone, for example, is adding 95GW capacity – equaling almost half of the European Union’s (EU) total coal fleet and 55% of the U.S.

Despite capacity addition, the utilization hours of the coal plants have fallen across all four countries, highlighting the potential to shut down inefficient plants. At the same time, each country has increased its share of energy generated from renewables. The new plants could run for lower hours, and rapid renewable energy (RE) buildouts could be prioritized. Solar and wind, in particular, are cheap and quickly deployable energy sources.

Given each country’s diverse economic structures and energy policies, scaling finance and managing risks for coal phaseouts means negotiating different priorities and pathways. The rapid buildout of renewables in these countries will further erode the share of coal generation in the power mix.

Coal has remained a stubborn component in each country’s national energy supply. China and Indonesia remain the most coal-dominant, with over half of all energy sourced from the fuel. Japan and South Korea rely mainly on imported fossil fuels, doing little to reduce coal reliance. Coal use has remained unchanged and is at the core of the generation mix in both countries. The use of liquefied natural gas (LNG) varies due to its fluctuating high cost; however, it has remained relatively unaffected.

Despite pledges to decarbonize in all four countries, coal-fired capacity has increased (Table 1).

In 2023, Japan and South Korea had a higher share of gas-fired capacity in total fossil fuel generation at 54% and 46%, respectively, compared to 24% for Indonesia and 10% for China (Table 2).

Meanwhile, all four countries have increased the share of energy sourced from renewables. China had the highest rise in absolute terms, with a 0.65GW increase per capita from 2020 to 2024, almost entirely driven by solar and wind (0.61GW). Japan added 0.14GW per capita of mainly solar energy from 2020 to 2023.

From 2020 to 2023, China recorded the largest increase in RE generation per capita, rising to 0.39GW. Japan and South Korea registered increases of 0.27GW and 0.3GW, respectively. China’s RE generation per capita was 46% of its fossil fuel generation, while Japan’s was higher at 69%. Indonesia had a minimal increase, which aligns with its limited increase in RE capacity.

Coal usage in the four countries

In 2024, China reported 4,392 utilization hours for its coal plants – an increase of 4% from 2020. This implies a 48% utilization rate of coal-fired power plants (CFPPs) for 8,760 total annual hours. In 2023, Indonesia’s utilization hours were 4,204, a decrease of 13% from the previous year, with a 38% increase in coal power capacity. For the same year, Japan’s coal utilization hours declined by 15% to 5,905, presenting a utilization rate of 67%. Meanwhile, in 2024, South Korea’s utilization hours were 5,110, a decrease of 10% from 2020, signifying a 58% utilization rate.

Compared with 2020, Japan and South Korea reduced their coal utilization hours in 2023 by 15% and 10%, respectively. However, both countries boosted their coal power capacity over the same period. Japan added 14%, and South Korea added 9% more coal capacity. Two units of 650MW capacity each were completed at Japan’s Yokosuka plant in June and December 2023.

These utilization rates are low for all four countries. Ultra-supercritical (USC) coal plants, used for the most recent builds, should have utilization rates of above 80%, while older subcritical plants should be able to operate at 65% and above. Low utilization rates imply that these countries may have overbuilt coal capacity. Thus, there could be substantial room to retire the oldest, least efficient plants. As RE additions progress, these rate dynamics are likely to evolve further.

RE eroding the share of coal generation in China’s power mix

Since 2020, China has added enough wind and solar capacity to have the flexibility to reduce fossil fuel reliance. Wind and solar account for 42% of total power capacity in 2024 (Table 7), and RE accounts for 35% of electricity generation.

Recent events, such as the withdrawal of the U.S. from the Paris Agreement in January 2025, have directed the focus to China. Some commentators have presented China as a climate leader and emphasized the buildout of its RE capacity, while others stress that the country is still increasing its coal capacity.

The building of both RE and coal power capacity could be viewed as complementary. Currently, RE capacity is underutilized due to transmission constraints resulting in an urgency to upgrade the grid. The Lantau Group, a consultancy specializing in the China power sector, has stated that the country’s coal generation hours could peak during 2025. However, this is dependent on the availability of hydropower which in 2022 accounted for just 14% of power generation compared to 18% in 2020. Additionally, some of China’s new coal capacity additions are flexible USC coal plants, able to operate at rates as low as 30% utilization, giving priority to RE.

Global Energy Monitor’s Sustainability by Numbers states, “China is building more coal plants but might burn less coal”. In 2023, China added 50GW of coal but retired 4GW. Also, these coal plants are more likely to be approved at the provincial rather than the central level as this improves the economic scorecard for provinces. These conflicting decision-making priorities between central-based renewable capacity and provincial-based coal capacity have yet to be resolved.

There are two positive developments. First, the rapid buildout of solar and wind capacity from 2020 to 2024 provides the flexibility to use additional RE. Second, the current tariff pricing discourages growth in gas generation compared to competitively priced RE.

In 2020, China’s wind power generation capacity was 329GW, while solar power was 307GW. By the end of 2024, wind power capacity had increased by 85% to 521GW, and solar capacity had risen by more than twofold to 887GW. During this period, coal capacity grew by 15%, or 157GW, and total thermal capacity was 219GW, or 18%, compared to an 872GW increase in wind and solar power.

There are concerns that wind and solar power additions will slow in 2025. S&P Global reports that the National Energy Administration (NEA) has targeted 60% of non-fossil fuel capacity additions in 2025. 430GW of capacity additions are expected, and RE additions are estimated to be around 200GW. This is comparable with 275GW in solar and 88GW in wind power generation in 2024. Reuters reports that the China Photovoltaic Industry Association has forecast a range of 215GW to 255GW with the power pricing mechanism in June 2025 for new RE plants to sell power on a market basis. This new pricing could mean less generous subsidies for new solar farms. Carbon Brief reports that China started work on 94.5GW of coal power in 2024.

Wind and solar power accounted for 9.5% of total power generation in 2020, increasing to 14.4% in 2024. The estimated utilization hours for solar capacity in 2024 were 473 compared to 1,030 hours in 2020. This suggests that there is room to increase solar power generation subject to transmission grid upgrades. The State Grid of China has estimated capital expenditure at RMB650 billion (bn) or USD89bn for 2025.

Tariffs are a significant reason for the increase in RE generation and the limited growth of gas power. The Shenhua Group’s (one of China’s largest utilities) 2024 annual report shows that the average coal tariff that year was USD55 per megawatt-hour (MWh) compared to USD44 per MWh for solar. The gas tariff was USD77 per MWh, which is 39% higher than coal and 74% higher than solar (Table 9). High gas tariffs are the primary reason that LNG is unable to displace coal in China’s power mix.

Despite rising Chinese imports over the last decade, LNG has not displaced coal and has been used for industrial purposes. RE has eroded the share of coal generation in the country’s power mix. China relies on domestically produced resources, not LNG, for energy security and reliability.

Starting from June 2025, China will move towards a market-based tariff for RE, resulting in higher tariffs and limited utilization for new projects. Existing RE projects will retain their current pricing, while new projects will shift to the new market-based rates. This could mean a surge in RE projects being completed ahead of the 2025 price changes.

Captive coal and RE transition challenges in Indonesia

Coal accounted for 56% of Indonesia’s 93GW power capacity in 2023, while gas constituted 22%. The country is emerging as the world’s top nickel supplier, used in steel and EV battery production.

11.2GW, or 20% of Indonesia’s total coal-fired power generation capacity, is used to support nickel smelters. There are approximately 20GW of new captive coal plants in the pipeline. Any attempt to build out RE to replace coal power plants faces regulatory difficulties, including procurement and tariff mechanism challenges.

Indonesia faces three challenges in its transition to RE. First is the issue of captive coal plants. Ember estimates that out of the current 49.7GW of CFPP capacity, 11.2GW is from captive coal plants, mainly supporting nickel smelters, with an additional 20GW of captive coal-fired capacity proposed. The second issue is finding ways to mobilize the USD20bn from the Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP). While the U.S. has withdrawn from the program, Germany and Japan are stepping into co-leadership roles. The third issue is that RE projects face policy risks such as granting equity stakes to the national electricity utility, PT Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN), procurement transparency, carbon credits surrendering, and low RE tariffs.

Indonesia’s coal capacity increased by 14.3GW from 37.3GW in 2020 to 51.6GW in 2023. Ember notes that 26.8GW of new coal capacity could be added by 2031, and captive coal capacity could reach 31.5GW. Over the same period, gas power capacity increased from 1.6GW to 20.7GW. Total RE (hydro, bio, geothermal, wind, and solar) rose from 10.5GW to 13.1GW, while solar power increased by only 0.4GW, with a negligible increase in wind capacity. The share of RE only accounts for 14% of Indonesia’s total power capacity in 2023, compared to 56% for coal and 22% for gas.

Overcoming hurdles to reduce coal-fired capacity and boost RE in Indonesia

The demand for electric vehicle (EV) batteries has driven Indonesia’s nickel output growth. According to industry consultant Roskill, nickel demand for batteries is forecast to rise from 6% in 2020 to 33% in 2030. Indonesia imposed an export ban on nickel ore in January 2014 and encouraged the building of new smelters for processing.

According to Statista, Indonesian nickel production was 770,000 tonnes in 2020, but by 2024, S&P Global calculates that production reached 2.1 million (mn) tonnes. Indonesia’s global nickel share has grown from 16% in 2019 to 43% in 2024. China-led investment made this increase possible. According to China’s Ministry of Commerce, the country’s total direct investment in Indonesia was USD4.4bn in 2021, and USD4.5bn in 2022. Chinese investment in the Indonesian nickel sector is estimated to be USD30bn, and there are currently 43 nickel smelters operating in Indonesia. These plants are powered by 11.2GW of captive coal power.

Private companies would be responsible for replacing these plants with RE projects. However, if RE plants have excess capacity to replace captive coal, that would need to be discussed with PLN.

The Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air and the Global Energy Monitor highlight that other industries, such as glass and aluminum, may also require captive coal plants, identifying that an additional 15.2GW could be added by 2026.

The JETP incorporates ambitious national plans designed to support select developing economies, providing the financing to retire high carbon-emitting power plants and developing RE generation. There are currently four countries covered by the JETP - South Africa, Senegal, Indonesia, and Vietnam. The latter two are valued at USD20bn and USD15bn, respectively. The funding consists of grants, guarantees, and concessional and commercial loans and includes public financing from countries and regions such as the EU, United Kingdom, Japan, and Germany. Private funders include multilateral development banks and climate investment funds. Given current U.S. efforts to boost LNG exports, its exit from JETP may increase the scaling up of RE capacity without using gas as a transition fuel.

Indonesia has not included private captive coal power in its decarbonization commitments under JETP. This risks the program’s funding and support, given that supporting countries, businesses, and philanthropies are unlikely to assist in shuttering older coal plants in one area only to see new ones built elsewhere.

Current Indonesian policies and onerous bidding and contractual requirements that deter solar and wind power are the most significant challenges in replacing coal power in the long term. These raise costs and discourage private investment. In 2023, Indonesia attracted only USD1.5bn in RE investment but needs to secure USD146bn in the near term to meet the country’s 2030 climate target.

Several regulatory challenges are holding back renewable energy development in the country. First, either PLN or its subsidiary has to own at least 51% equity interest in RE projects. Second, ceiling tariffs for RE projects are too low, making achieving profit targets difficult. Third, under recent power purchase agreements, any carbon credits must be fully allocated to PLN, and independent power producers cannot benefit from them. Finally, the procurement procedures are not transparent. Revising RE project regulations can create an investor-friendly environment for Indonesia and accelerate the energy transition.

South Korea and its LNG “power tariff trilemma”

In 2023, coal accounted for 33%, and gas comprised 27% of South Korea’s power capacity. Due to increased solar power, RE (solar, wind, and bioenergy, excluding pumped hydro) constituted 23% of total capacity. The country is in a “power tariff trilemma” where interconnected challenges of energy security, competitiveness, and sustainability have contributed to rising electricity bills due to the high share of LNG-based gas power generation.

The country has also pushed to build new LNG import terminals and storage facilities despite having some of the lowest utilization rates for its existing terminals.

The country’s coal capacity accounted for 28% of the total power capacity in 2020 and 27% in 2023, while LNG constituted 33% of capacity share in 2020 and 31% in 2023. RE (solar, wind, and bioenergy, excluding pumped hydro) increased from 18% in 2020 to 23% in 2023, driven by a 10GW increase in solar power. This is half of China’s 36% wind and solar share of total capacity in 2023.

The share of coal in power generation declined from 36% in 2020 to 33% in 2023. The share of gas also dropped slightly from 28% in 2020 to 27% in 2023. In 2022, South Korea incurred USD17bn additional costs for LNG-fired power generation due to the over-reliance of utilities on fossil fuels. The slow adoption of RE is a missed opportunity to reduce power prices. The share of wind and solar in South Korea’s power generation increased from 7% in 2020 to just 9% in 2023.

South Korea pursued fossil fuel-oriented energy security, assuming it would guarantee an affordable electricity supply. This approach faced headwinds as the Russia-Ukraine war disrupted gas and coal markets. Soaring fossil fuel prices, especially LNG, and South Korea’s heavy reliance on fossil fuels (58.5% in 2023) led to total fuel costs of USD25bn during this period.

Due to South Korea’s regulated power pricing mechanism, the national utility Korea Electric Power Corporation (KEPCO) sold electricity to consumers at prices that did not cover fuel costs. KEPCO had to issue more debt to cover the revenue gap. At the time, the utility’s RE capacity was only 2% of total power capacity.

South Korea could benefit by reducing reliance on fossil fuels in the power mix and expediting the transition to clean energy sources. Power pricing should also be reformed to reflect actual costs.

Japan could benefit from reducing its reliance on gas

In 2023, coal accounted for 34% of Japan’s generation, while gas contributed 36%. RE sources (hydro, solar, wind, and bioenergy) constituted 23% in 2023 due to increased solar power.

Japan has the third-highest installed solar capacity globally due in large part to attractive feed-in-tariff policies instituted in 2012 in the wake of the 2011 Fukushima disaster.

The country’s LNG consumption has fallen 25% in the last decade as nuclear facilities have restarted and RE sources have developed.

Japan’s Seventh Strategic Energy Plan emphasizes a “self-development ratio”, encouraging Japanese companies to invest directly in fossil fuel development abroad. Shifting from fossil fuels to RE would reduce the risks of continued reliance on fossil fuels. Although the country has increased solar capacity from 2020 to 2023, the shares for coal and gas remain at a combined 44% for 2023. The share of RE (including hydro, solar, wind, and bioenergy) in the total capacity rose from 35% in 2020 to 39% in 2023.

The share of coal in power generation has remained steady at 34% from 2020 to 2023. Gas share in power generation declined from 41% in 2020 to 36% in 2023. In 2022, surging LNG prices and a weakened Yen drove Japan’s annual electricity price to JPY20.4 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) (USD0.14/kWh) compared to the 2005-2024 range of JPY6.5-16.5/kWh (USD0.04-0.11/kWh).

Japan aims to increase vertical integration in fossil fuel procurement and delivery and the self-development ratio from 35% to 50% by 2030. This ratio represents the share of the offtake amount of oil and natural gas controlled by Japanese entities. Notably, LNG projects in Mozambique, Canada, and the Middle East resulted in losses for Japanese companies.

RE development could help enhance energy security and affordability in Japan. The utility-scale sales rate for RE was JPY9.9/kWh in 2023, less than half of JPY22.3/kWh for gas and JPY18.6/kWh for coal in the same year. Japan, with its technological leadership, is well-positioned to integrate RE and grid-scale battery storage.

The economics of RE prevails despite unique challenges

From 2020 to 2023, all four Asian countries reduced coal and fossil fuel use and increased RE capacity. Despite renewables being the most cost-effective energy source, these countries are finding it difficult to break coal’s grasp. Japan and South Korea appear reluctant to write off the sunk cost of coal, while China and Indonesia are reticent to let go of a domestic but expensive energy source.

Despite each country’s unique challenges, expediting the transition to clean energy sources connects logically with economic and climate commitments. For Japan, South Korea, and Indonesia, where fuel costs are denominated in U.S. Dollars, accelerated RE deployment can create a natural near-term hedge against global volatility. China has already committed to a green technology future, becoming the world’s RE powerhouse.

Mark Westfall, who led a team of 50 engineers working on energy products, announced in April that he had left Tesla, Electrek reported. He worked on such projects as Supercharger, Powerwall, and Megapack.

Westfall had worked at the electric vehicle pioneer for 10 years.

""It's hard to put into words what Tesla has meant to me,"" Westfall wrote on LinkedIn. ""I never imagined the places this job would take me, or the impact I would be able to have.""

According to Electrek, Westfall left to become director of engineering at Redwood Materials, which itself has many ties to Tesla. The company buys scrap materials from Tesla's battery-manufacturing process, which it then recycles to create new battery materials.

Tesla co-founder and board member JB Straubel founded Redwood, and several of its executives are former Tesla employees.

Westfall became the latest high-ranking employee to leave Tesla so far in 2025. It has also said goodbye to the head of its Indian market, a vice president of software engineering, the technical program manager for its Cortex supercomputer, and two of its top automotive designers.

This mass departure of talent comes at a time when Tesla's business has been slipping. The company's 2025 first-quarter sales numbers are down globally, and its net income dropped 71% from Q1 2024.

Overall, however, EV sales continue to grow as more people discover the environmental and economic benefits of switching to an EV. Although some models cost more up front than their gas-powered counterparts, EVs typically have much lower maintenance costs and don't require regular, costly fill-ups.

The ownership costs can come down even more when an owner pairs their EV with solar panels, which allow EV drivers to rely less on public charging stations and avoid reliance on the grid for recharging at home. Those interested in solar can save up to $10,000 on installation costs by using EnergySage's free service to compare local, vetted installers.

Conclusion: A Paradox of Peace and Peril The shift to renewable energy promises a cleaner, more sustainable planet.
If not, the age of renewables could become not the end of energy conflict—but its green reawakening.","As the world races to transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy, a new energy order is beginning to emerge—one that promises cleaner air and climate resilience but also portends fresh geopolitical tensions.

The shift to solar, wind, hydrogen, and rare earth-powered technologies is not merely a technological revolution; it is a profound geopolitical reordering with the potential to ignite a new spectrum of global conflict. From the strategic control of critical minerals to green technology rivalry, energy access disputes, and economic power realignment, the green transition may ironically generate new fault lines even as it attempts to heal the planet.

The End of Oil Wars?

For much of the 20th and early 21st centuries, access to oil and gas has been a key driver of global conflict. The 1991 Gulf War, the 2003 Iraq War, and Russia’s strategic hold over Europe via gas pipelines all reflect the centrality of hydrocarbons in world politics. As Daniel Yergin, author of The Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money, and Power, notes, fossil fuels have underpinned not only energy security but also military logistics, alliance structures, and strategic coercion.

With the rise of renewables, some analysts, such as Meghan O’Sullivan in her book Windfall: How the New Energy Abundance Upends Global Politics and Strengthens American Power, argue that energy geopolitics will soften. Renewables are decentralized, locally producible, and harder to weaponize. However, this optimistic view overlooks a critical reality: while fossil fuels are geographically concentrated, the raw materials and technologies required for the green transition are also limited and unevenly distributed, introducing new battlefronts.

The New Strategic Commodities: Lithium, Cobalt, and Rare Earths

Unlike oil, which is pumped and transported via tanker or pipeline, renewable energy infrastructure is built with minerals—vast amounts of them. The International Energy Agency (IEA), in its 2021 report The Role of Critical Minerals in Clean Energy Transitions, warned that a single electric vehicle requires six times more mineral inputs than a conventional car, and a wind power plant requires nine times more mineral resources than a gas-fired plant.

This demand has turned materials like lithium, cobalt, nickel, graphite, and rare earth elements into the new “black gold.” These minerals are geographically concentrated: 60% of global cobalt comes from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), 50% of lithium from Australia, 80% of rare earth processing from China. This imbalance introduces both supply chain vulnerabilities and potential zones of competition.

As noted by Foreign Policy (July 2023), China’s near-monopoly on rare earth processing gives it leverage over the West, similar to OPEC’s role in the 1970s. In 2020, Beijing threatened to cut off rare earth exports to Lockheed Martin amid tensions over Taiwan. The U.S. has since responded with the CHIPS and Science Act, and new mining initiatives in Australia and Latin America, seeking to “de-risk” rather than decouple from China.

Resource Nationalism and Green Colonialism

The strategic importance of these minerals has led to renewed interest in resource-rich nations, particularly in Africa and Latin America. Bolivia’s vast lithium reserves—dubbed the “Saudi Arabia of lithium”—have become the center of global bidding wars. Elon Musk’s 2020 tweet about “couping whoever we want” in Bolivia (later deleted) after a pro-lithium government was ousted sparked accusations of “green imperialism.”

As The Guardian (Feb 2023) reported, indigenous communities in Argentina, Chile, and Bolivia are increasingly protesting lithium extraction projects over water depletion, environmental degradation, and lack of benefit-sharing. The so-called “green transition” risks replicating the exploitative dynamics of past resource rushes, inflaming local unrest and geopolitical tensions as states compete for strategic access.

Moreover, as Nick Buxton and Ben Hayes argue in The Secure and the Dispossessed, there is a risk that climate action becomes securitized—framed as a zero-sum struggle over dwindling resources—leading to militarized responses to local opposition and migration pressures. In this framing, environmentalism itself could become a justification for conflict.

The Hydrogen Race: New Rivalries in Old Geographies

Beyond minerals, green hydrogen—produced from renewable electricity—has emerged as the next frontier in clean energy. Countries like Germany, Japan, and South Korea, short on solar landmass, are looking to import green hydrogen from sun-rich nations like Namibia, Morocco, and Australia.

This shift introduces new geopolitical dependencies. For instance, Germany’s multi-billion euro hydrogen agreements with North African states could tie its future industrial competitiveness to the political stability of regions that have historically seen unrest. As Der Spiegel (April 2024) warned, over-reliance on green hydrogen imports from politically unstable regions may reproduce the same energy insecurity that plagued Europe’s dependence on Russian gas.

Moreover, Gulf countries like Saudi Arabia and the UAE are pivoting from oil to green hydrogen, using their capital and geopolitical clout to dominate future energy markets. NEOM’s green hydrogen project in Saudi Arabia is being positioned as a global hub. As highlighted in The Financial Times (March 2024), this could reshape regional power hierarchies and revive competition among Gulf states for energy hegemony, potentially destabilizing an already fragile Middle East.

Infrastructure Conflicts and Grid Colonialism

Control over electricity transmission infrastructure could also become a source of conflict. Unlike oil, which is stored and traded in tankers, solar and wind energy require extensive grid interconnectivity to stabilize supply. Initiatives like the EU’s “SuperGrid,” the African Union’s “Desert to Power” initiative, and China’s “Global Energy Interconnection” plan reflect growing ambitions to build transnational electricity networks.

However, as scholar Andreas Goldthau points out in The Geopolitics of the Global Energy Transition, such mega-grids require political alignment, technical interoperability, and shared regulatory norms. If these grids are dominated by a few players—China in Asia, the EU in Africa—they risk becoming tools of political influence. Nations left out of these infrastructures may become energy-insecure and marginalized.

Conflicts may also arise within states. In India, land acquisition for solar parks in Rajasthan and Gujarat has led to protests by farmers and indigenous communities. As Al Jazeera (January 2024) reported, the clash between national climate goals and local livelihoods is emerging as a new axis of internal tension.

Technological Protectionism and Green Trade Wars

The green race is also spurring techno-nationalism. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) passed by the U.S. in 2022, which includes subsidies for domestically produced electric vehicles and solar panels, has provoked backlash from allies like the EU and South Korea. Brussels responded with its own Green Deal Industrial Plan to defend European industry.

As the New York Times (October 2023) reported, this has triggered a green trade war between the West and China, which still dominates the global solar panel, battery, and electric vehicle markets. In 2024, the U.S. imposed new tariffs on Chinese EVs over alleged “overcapacity,” while Beijing filed WTO complaints, threatening retaliatory action.

These skirmishes could escalate as countries compete not just to go green, but to own the green economy. Intellectual property disputes, export restrictions on key technologies, and investment screening in critical sectors are likely to rise, creating an environment of suspicion and economic fragmentation.

Water and Climate Security Intersections

Renewable energy is also highly water-dependent. Hydropower, green hydrogen production, and even lithium extraction consume significant water resources. In water-stressed regions like Central Asia, North Africa, and the Middle East, this may intensify competition over transboundary rivers and aquifers.

For instance, Ethiopia’s Grand Renaissance Dam, intended to supply renewable hydropower to millions, has triggered regional tension with Egypt and Sudan. As noted by the Carnegie Endowment (2022), the dam’s completion could lead to prolonged geopolitical friction if water-sharing mechanisms fail.

Climate change will act as a conflict multiplier, creating migration flows, agricultural decline, and energy demand spikes. In this volatile context, renewable energy infrastructure becomes both a lifeline and a target—vulnerable to sabotage, cyberattacks, and geopolitical leverage.

Who Controls the Narrative?

Lastly, the question of global leadership in the energy transition is itself a geopolitical contest. China has positioned itself as the green manufacturing superpower. The EU sees itself as the norm-setter, pushing for global standards through its Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM). The U.S. is attempting to lead on innovation and capital allocation.

But the Global South, often cast as a supplier of resources or a site of carbon offsetting, is demanding a voice. At COP28 and beyond, countries like India, Brazil, and South Africa have argued for “just transitions” that include technology transfers, debt forgiveness, and inclusive governance.

As Jason Bordoff of Columbia’s Center on Global Energy Policy argues, the green transition could either entrench existing hierarchies or democratize energy access. Which path is chosen will depend on whether energy justice becomes a serious global commitment—or an afterthought.

Conclusion: A Paradox of Peace and Peril

The shift to renewable energy promises a cleaner, more sustainable planet. Yet, as with all transformative technologies, it will redistribute power, provoke competition, and—if mismanaged—ignite conflict. From critical mineral rushes and techno-protectionism to hydrogen geopolitics and infrastructure rivalries, the green revolution carries risks that mirror and magnify existing global tensions.

Policymakers must anticipate these flashpoints. Strategic stockpiling, diversified supply chains, fair mining practices, and multilateral coordination over technology and standards are essential. But perhaps most critically, the world must ensure that the energy transition uplifts rather than exploits. If not, the age of renewables could become not the end of energy conflict—but its green reawakening.",https://www.eurasiareview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/b-148.jpg,N,,2025-06-01 22:02:39.643225

BILLINGS, Mont. – Today, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) released a revised Coal Combustion Residuals (CCR) rule that no longer exempts inactive impoundments at inactive facilities, also known as “legacy units”. The proposed new rule would address the over half billion tons of coal ash and the decades-old ash ponds that have escaped inspections and leaked toxic chemicals into the drinking and stock water of surrounding communities.

The 2015 CCR Rule, also known as the Coal Ash Rule, set forth national minimum safeguards for existing and new CCR landfills, in addition to new CCR surface impoundments, protecting groundwater and air resources in communities across the country. The initial 2015 rule, however, failed to include legacy units. When the new rule takes effect, operators who profited from burning coal for decades will not be allowed to walk away from their hundreds of inactive landfills and legacy ponds, poisoning drinking water, and leaving the mess for taxpayers to clean up. In addition to making drinking water supplies safe again, ash pond remediation provides jobs to local workers.

In response to the new safeguards, Bob LeResche, Chair of the Western Organization of Resource Councils said,

“Western Organization of Resource Councils and our thousands of members across the western U.S., applaud EPA for taking the long-overdue step to include legacy ponds and inactive landfills in the CCR Rule. From Colstrip to Wyodak to Stanton, our members have experienced firsthand the impacts of unregulated ponds and landfills. We do applaud EPA for taking this step to strengthen the CCR rule, but want to emphasize that the changes will be useless without proper implementation by EPA. We hope that the agency’s oversight and enforcement will greatly improve so that frontline communities throughout the West and the nation that are now dealing with groundwater contamination from legacy ponds can finally return to a more habitable way of life within a healthy community.”",,N,,2025-06-02 00:03:06.744123

The regulator certified the design in January 2023, making it the first SMR design to be cleared by the regulator for use in the USA.
NuScale subsequently uprated the capacity of the power unit to 77 MWe and in January 2023 submitted an application for NRC approval of a six-unit configuration based on the uprated design.
“The standard design approval is based upon the staff’s final safety evaluation report, issued 28 May,” it said.
“The US NRC’s uprate approval of the NuScale SMR technology now strengthens ENTRA1 Energy to produce and deliver energy as the most near-term American SMR power solution via ENTRA1 Energy Plants with NuScale SMR technology inside,” NuScale said.","The US Nuclear Regulatory Commission has approved the 77 MWe version of NuScale Power’s NuScale Power Module small modular reactor design. The regulator had previously approved a 50 MWe version of the design.

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) accepted NuScale’s design certification application for a plant comprising up to twelve 50 MWe power modules in March 2017. The regulator certified the design in January 2023, making it the first SMR design to be cleared by the regulator for use in the USA.

NuScale subsequently uprated the capacity of the power unit to 77 MWe and in January 2023 submitted an application for NRC approval of a six-unit configuration based on the uprated design. The application was accepted for NRC review in July 2023.

The NRC has now announced that it has approved the uprated SMR design. “The standard design approval is based upon the staff’s final safety evaluation report, issued 28 May,” it said. “This completes the NRC’s technical review ahead of schedule and under budget, demonstrating the agency’s commitment to safely and efficiently enable new, advanced reactor technology.”

A standard design approval indicates that a proposed reactor design meets applicable NRC safety requirements. Companies that seek to use the design would have to file applications seeking permission to construct and operate a nuclear reactor using the approved design.

NuScale said its uprated design features the same fundamental safety case and passive safety features previously approved by the NRC with “a power uprate and select design changes to support growing capacity needs”.

“The US NRC’s uprate approval of the NuScale SMR technology now strengthens ENTRA1 Energy to produce and deliver energy as the most near-term American SMR power solution via ENTRA1 Energy Plants with NuScale SMR technology inside,” NuScale said. “ENTRA1 Energy is NuScale’s partner and independent power plant development platform, which holds the global exclusive rights to the commercialisation, distribution, and deployment of NuScale’s SMRs.”

It added that NRC approval of the uprated design enables ENTRA1 Energy to “provide a wider range of off-takers and consumers with reliable, carbon-free energy”.

“We are thrilled that the NRC has approved our second SDA application, this time for our 77 MWe design,” said NuScale President and CEO John Hopkins. “This marks a historic moment not only for NuScale, but the entire industry, as NuScale and ENTRA1 move closer to meeting the demands of clean energy users.

“For more than a decade, our team has proudly worked alongside the NRC to achieve the successful approval of our designs. The NRC is domestically and internationally recognised and respected for its rigorous safety standards, and this approval is a crucial step toward meeting our goal of providing clean, reliable, and, most importantly, safe energy to off-takers and consumers.”",https://www.eurasiareview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/b-13.jpeg,N,,2025-06-01 22:02:46.640962

Ministers accept that high energy costs — which manufacturers claim are 46 per cent higher than the global average — must be addressed in the industrial strategy, according to government officials.
Meanwhile Make UK, the manufacturing lobby group, said industrial energy costs in Britain were four times as high as those in the US and 46 per cent above the global average.
“The upcoming industrial strategy will be fatally flawed unless sky-high energy costs are tackled,” it said.
“If we don’t address the issue of high industrial energy costs as a priority, we risk the security of our country,” Stephen Phipson, Make UK’s chief executive said.","Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has been warned by British business that his vaunted industrial strategy, to be published this month, will be “fatally flawed” unless it deals comprehensively with the country’s very high energy costs.

Ministers accept that high energy costs — which manufacturers claim are 46 per cent higher than the global average — must be addressed in the industrial strategy, according to government officials.

But business groups fear the government will be too timid, targeting help at only the most energy-intensive sectors — such as steel and ceramics — rather than a wider range of companies struggling with power bills.

Ministers are looking to increase the generosity of the “British Industry Supercharger” scheme, set up by Rishi Sunak’s Conservative government in April 2024, which cut bills for 370 energy-intensive companies, according to people briefed on the plans.

Rain Newton-Smith, director-general of the CBI employers’ federation, told the Financial Times: “Unless the industrial strategy delivers a solution to the UK’s high energy costs for industry, it will have failed.”

Newton-Smith said a “more comprehensive” solution had to be found, rather than just focusing on the biggest energy users, adding that the chemicals, aerospace and car industries were among those suffering most from high power bills.

Meanwhile Make UK, the manufacturing lobby group, said industrial energy costs in Britain were four times as high as those in the US and 46 per cent above the global average.

“The upcoming industrial strategy will be fatally flawed unless sky-high energy costs are tackled,” it said.

Starmer’s industrial strategy is prioritising eight “growth” sectors: advanced manufacturing, clean energy, creative industries, defence, digital and technologies, financial services, life sciences, and professional and business services.

Officials close to business secretary Jonathan Reynolds said: “Johnny has said that energy is always something that comes up. He is alive to the fact that the industrial strategy needs to have some good answers on energy.”

Industry officials briefed on government thinking expect ministers to take a more generous approach to the British Industry Supercharger, which Sunak’s government said would save energy intensive users, such as steelmakers, some £410mn in 2025.

They said ministers were looking at increasing the cut in network charges for eligible companies from 60 per cent to close to the 90 per cent compensation offered by France and Germany to industrial users for these network charges.

But business groups want the reductions in energy bills to be distributed more widely, including by removing levies such as the “renewables obligation” and “climate change levy” from bills.

“If we don’t address the issue of high industrial energy costs as a priority, we risk the security of our country,” Stephen Phipson, Make UK’s chief executive said.

Alan Johnson, senior vice-president at the Japanese carmaker Nissan, said: “The Nissan Sunderland manufacturing plant has the highest energy costs of all Nissan plants across the globe.”

The industrial strategy is due to be published at around the same time as the Treasury’s comprehensive spending review on June 11.

The Department for Business and Trade declined to comment on “speculation” on the strategy’s contents.",https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2Fa3196eea-6d00-4b38-a12e-2046fe762bff.jpg?source=next-article&fit=scale-down&quality=highest&width=700&dpr=1,N,,2025-06-01 20:04:16.011194

In the UK, renewables companies experienced around 1,000 attempted cyberattacks every day(link is external) last year, according to cybersecurity analysis.
Protecting the energy transition Alongside the growing risk of cyberattacks, the shortage of experts in energy cybersecurity(link is external) is further exacerbating the situation.
One thing experts are clear about is that energy companies need to take charge of the situation themselves — and fast.
As the energy transition progresses, the industry must balance the benefits of digitalization with the need for robust cybersecurity measures.","When you glance at your smart meter to see how much electricity you’ve used that day, a cyberattack is likely not front of mind. And yet, Internet of Things (IoT) devices such as these can be an easy access point for cybercriminals.

There was a 200% increase in attacks on utilities(link is external) in 2023 and the average cost of data breaches in the energy sector is over $4 million(link is external). Europe alone saw a doubling of cyberattacks in the power sector(link is external) between 2020 and 2022, while in the US, there was an almost 70% hike in cyberattacks on utilities during 2024(link is external), compared to the previous year.

So it’s a huge issue, and one that utility companies — and governments — are keen to address.

And within this landscape, the renewables sector has become a prime target(link is external). To keep up with the rapidly unfolding energy transition, digital technology to help integrate and manage renewables is being adopted at pace, which is creating more potential attack surfaces. For example, integrating more renewables projects and battery energy storage systems requires software that allows the technologies to interact and work together(link is external) – introducing cybersecurity risk across the system. Alongside, as renewables develop and scale, the number of stakeholders involved is increasing and includes businesses from a variety of sectors(link is external) alongside power companies. This too could increase the likelihood of cyber threats.

The growing cyber threat to renewable energy

Global renewable power capacity increased by 473 gigawatts (GW) in 2023(link is external), up 14% on the previous year, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), while the International Energy Agency (IEA) anticipates 5,500 GW to become operational by 2030(link is external).

This is all good news for the environment and global targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. But it also presents an opportunity for cybercriminals to exploit vulnerabilities in dispersed and relatively new systems.

Digital technologies such as IoT, artificial intelligence (AI) and middleware, the software that joins all the dots, are now vital additions to utility companies scrambling to keep up with demand.

These technologies enhance efficiency, enable better integration of renewable energy sources, improve demand forecasting and optimize grid performance in real time. In short, they are an indispensable factor in the energy transition. But not an uncomplicated one.

Solar energy alone, which accounted for three-quarters of the world’s renewable capacity additions in 2023(link is external), is susceptible to six different types of cyberattack(link is external); wind farms can be disrupted because the remote control mechanism can be hacked; battery energy storage systems and electric vehicle charging stations can be similarly compromised.

Last year, the Federal Bureau of Investigation issued a warning to the US renewable energy industry that “malicious cyber actors may seek to disrupt power generating operations, steal intellectual property, or ransom information critical for normal functionality to advance geopolitical motives or financial gain”. It cited a 2019 example of a private solar company that suffered a denial-of-service attack(link is external), resulting in the “lost visibility” of 500MW of wind and solar sites in California, Utah and Wyoming.

In the UK, renewables companies experienced around 1,000 attempted cyberattacks every day(link is external) last year, according to cybersecurity analysis. These attempts are not hitting the headlines, however — unlike the renewable energy disruption of 2022, when a cyberattack on a satellite communications network brought 5,800 wind turbines(link is external) in Germany to a standstill.

Protecting the energy transition

Alongside the growing risk of cyberattacks, the shortage of experts in energy cybersecurity(link is external) is further exacerbating the situation. While almost three-quarters of the energy and utilities industry is currently utilizing generative AI for its cybersecurity operations, there is a 42% shortfall in cybersecurity personnel in the sector(link is external), according to a Boston Consulting Group survey.

The new US administration has just taken steps to address the wider cybersecurity skills gap; its proposed Cyber PIVOTT Act(link is external) would introduce scholarship programs in exchange for government service. Meanwhile, Europe introduced the Cybersecurity Skills Academy(link is external) in 2023 to tackle the issue.

The EU has also been focusing on legislation, with its Network and Information Security Directive(link is external) that aims to harmonize cybersecurity regulations across member states, particularly around critical infrastructure such as energy, coming into effect last year.

One thing experts are clear about is that energy companies need to take charge of the situation themselves — and fast. At a basic level, cybersecurity training across organizations is essential. Implementing monitoring systems can help protect critical infrastructure from cyberattacks. This is the idea behind InteRSePT, a Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) Group cybersecurity solution that can be trained to detect anomalous or suspicious behavior across the control network of power plants and manufacturing facilities.

As the energy transition progresses, the industry must balance the benefits of digitalization with the need for robust cybersecurity measures. As grids become more digital and decentralized, the risk of cyberattacks increases, potentially disrupting energy supply and undermining progress toward a more sustainable power system.

To stay ahead of these threats, utilities, governments and technology providers must work together to strengthen cybersecurity defenses, implement robust regulatory frameworks and invest in next-generation security solutions.",https://spectra.mhi.com/sites/g/files/jwhtju2216/files/styles/crop_freeform/public/Why-the-energy-transition-means-more-cyberattacks.jpeg?itok=xBM4sETC,N,,2025-06-01 20:04:20.760297

***

June 1, 2025

Dear Colleague:

This month, President Trump and Senate Republicans will attempt to jam through Congress their “One Ugly Bill,” — one of the most destructive and shamelessly self-serving pieces of legislation in modern American history. This partisan monstrosity is nothing short of a billionaire hand out paid for by American families and we will fight it with everything we've got. Senate Democrats will make sure the American People see this bill for what it is: a ruthless power grab by the nation’s most wealthy at the expense of American families, millions of Americans’ healthcare, and the very core of our democracy. Senate Democrats will use every tool at our disposal in this battle and we will enlist American families to join this fight.

The Republican plan is simple: sell-out working and middle-class families to pay-off the rich and well-connected. The bill would raise costs and taxes by an average of more than $800 for 40% of American families. 20 million Americans would see their health care costs skyrocket, while almost 14 million would lose their health insurance all together, including millions of children and seniors. 11 million people, including 4 million children, could lose access to safe and affordable food, while every one of the 40 million Americans receiving federal food assistance would get less support every month. All the while, their radical plan would see double digit energy cost increases for American households and businesses, and threaten close to 800,000 good-paying jobs in the clean-energy economy.

Why? To fund massive tax breaks to the nation’s richest, most powerful corporations. In fact, the legislation would gift a tax break of over $250,000 to the wealthiest 0.1% of American households. On this bill, Republicans’ rhetoric doesn’t match reality. The Congressional Budget Office has detailed that the Republican bill give the top 10% of earning households 65% of the benefit of the value of tax breaks while Americans making less than $51,000 a year would see their incomes go down.

Like many of you, I spent the past week hammering away at the Trump/Republican agenda as a betrayal of the middle class. Their entire agenda can be boiled down to this: billionaires win and families lose.

Billionaires win and families lose when Republicans kick millions of Americans off their health insurance by dismantling the ACA and proposing the largest cut to Medicaid in American history. Hospitals and health centers will close and thousands of people will lose jobs.

Billionaires win and families lose when millions of children and families go hungry under Republicans’ plan to cut $300 billion from federal food aid program.

Billionaires win and families lose when Republicans kill clean energy investments that have created hundreds of thousands of related jobs across the country, lowered energy prices, and made the US more competitive with China.

Republicans are hell-bent on making the Trump tax cuts for billionaires permanent, exploding the federal debt by adding over $50 trillion to it in the next 30 years. After crying foul for years about the deficit, Republicans are once again showing their true colors and ignoring the budget-busting cost of their Tax Scam, seemingly content to burden our children and grandchildren to a lifetime of higher interest rates, higher costs, and fewer opportunities. To do so, Republicans are planning to use the Budget Chair’s section 312 authority under the Congressional Budget Act in an unprecedented and illegitimate manner to run rough-shod over the Byrd Rule.

In the Senate, our Committees have been working overtime to prepare for the Byrd Bath, targeting the litany of policies included in the Republican plan that are in clear violation of the reconciliation rules and in some cases, an assault on our very democracy. For example, House Republicans snuck in a devious policy to restrict the authority of federal courts to hold government officials in contempt when they violate court orders. Republican’s naked subservience to a lawless President is gravely dangerous and Senate Democrats won’t stand for it. Should Senate Republicans include this rotten provision, I vow, alongside all of you, to fight tooth and nail to strike this authoritarian attack on our system of justice.

Based on Senate Republicans’ public comments, it’s clear that if this reckless reconciliation bill passes the Senate it is very likely to contain changes, forcing it to be sent back to the House of Representatives. That’s why we must be united with our House Democratic colleagues to fight this assault on working families. Sunday afternoon, I spoke with Leader Jeffries about ways our caucuses can fight back together. This week, DSPC Chair Klobuchar and I invited the House Ranking Members of Ways & Means, Energy & Commerce, and Budget to meet with our caucus and share firsthand insight from their process and key Republican faultlines. When we fight side by side, our voice is louder and our case is stronger – and in this moment, unity isn’t optional, it’s our strongest weapon in defending American families.

But the fight will not just be in the Capitol. Public sentiment is everything. To my core, I know that if the American people truly knew how deeply devastating, damaging, and deceitful this Republican plan is, they will reject it. So we must continue to rally the American people in the shared fight to stop this radical agenda. Our caucus has done in-state events, held numerous Spotlight hearings, engaged earned and social media to push back, taken to the Senate floor, held rallies, and more to educate the American people on what’s happening and to call out Donald Trump and the Republicans’ radical agenda. Their extreme vision is a threat to our democracy, and we’re not backing down. We’re doubling down—and we’re just getting started.

Republicans’ “One Ugly Bill” is a farce; an attack on the values that make America great. We know the first four months of Donald Trump’s presidency have been catastrophic for the American people. It is our duty to fight for American families, to stop the damage, and make certain Republicans are held accountable.

I look forward to returning to Washington this week to keep up the fight.

Sincerely,

Charles E. Schumer

United States Senator

Seoul: LG Energy Solution Ltd (LGES), South Korea's leading battery maker, said on Sunday it has begun mass production of lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries for energy storage systems (ESS) at its manufacturing plant in the United States.

The pouch-type LFP batteries for ESS, based on long cell technology, are being manufactured at the LGES plant in Michigan, according to the Korean company, reports Yonhap news agency.

""We are currently in discussions with multiple customers in the North American region for the supply of our ESS batteries,"" LGES officials said, noting that supply to a number of major U.S. energy firms, such as Terra-Gen and Delta Electronics, has already been confirmed.

LGES said it plans to swiftly respond to growing demand for ESS in advanced industries, such as artificial intelligence (AI) data centres and renewable energies.

LGES is the only major global battery maker that started mass production of LFP batteries tailored for use in ESS in the U.S.

Meanwhile, LG Energy Solution has won a lawsuit against China's Sunwoda Group in Germany over the infringement of two patents related to battery separator technology, a company representing LGES in Germany said.

The Munich District Court upheld injunction requests filed by Hungary-based patent management firm Tulip Innovation Kft., barring Sunwoda Group affiliates from selling lithium-ion batteries in Germany, Tulip said in a press release.

The affected companies include Sunwoda Electronic, Sunwoda Mobility Energy Technology, and their German subsidiaries, Sunwoda Europe and Sunwoda Electric Vehicle Battery Germany.

""These appear to be the first injunctions in Germany related to car batteries. There is no 'free riding' for battery manufacturers on technologies developed by innovation leaders like LGES and Panasonic Energy,"" the release said.

The court also ordered Sunwoda's affiliates to recall and destroy any remaining infringing batteries in their direct or indirect possession, pay damages to Tulip in principle, and provide detailed accounting records to facilitate damage assessment.

Sunwoda Group is expected to appeal the rulings, but Tulip said it is ""confident that the decision will stand on appeal.""

The two patents at issue involve battery separators -- a critical component for ensuring the safety and performance of electric vehicle batteries.

Conclusion The Congressional disapproval of California’s EPA waivers marks a pivotal moment in U.S. environmental and energy policy, highlighting tensions between federal authority and initiatives led by a few states.","The Senate has approved three Congressional Review Act resolutions initiated in the House of Representatives that overturn Environmental Protection Agency waivers, which had effectively imposed a de facto ban on the future sale of gasoline powered cars in California and 17 states, as well as Washington, DC.

Congressional disapproval of California’s electric vehicle mandates is another step toward ending the electric vehicle mandate on all Americans and now awaits President Trump’s signature.

Background: California’s Emissions Standards and EPA Waivers

Under Section 209 of the Clean Air Act, California has, since 1968, been granted waivers by the EPA to implement vehicle emissions standards more rigorous than federal requirements, citing “compelling and extraordinary circumstances” related to air quality. In December 2024, the Biden administration’s EPA granted such waivers, allowing California to proceed with its Advanced Clean Cars II program, aiming to phase out new internal combustion engine vehicle sales by 2035. Several states, including Maryland and Colorado, adopted the same California standards, collectively influencing a significant portion of the U.S. auto market.

The Joint Resolution

The resolution is short and straightforward:

“That Congress disapproves the rule submitted by the Environmental Protection Agency relating to “California State Motor Vehicle and Engine Pollution Control Standards; Advanced Clean Cars II; Waiver of Preemption; Notice of Decision” (90 Fed. Reg. 642 (January 6, 2025)), and such rule shall have no force or effect.”

Congressional Review Act and Legal Controversy

The CRA enables Congress to overturn federal regulations within a specific timeframe. However, its application to these EPA waivers has been contentious. Both the Government Accountability Office and the Senate Parliamentarian opined that the EPA waivers do not constitute “rules” under the CRA and thus are not subject to its provisions.

Interestingly, to mitigate risk of judicial redress based on the Senate’s Parliamentarian’s interpretation, the Senate set up an elaborate series of procedural votes to allow the Senate to settle the question of what qualifies under the CRA; an action that is typically referred to as the “nuclear option.” Historically used to avoid a filibuster, the nuclear option allows the majority party to use a simple majority vote to overturn a point of order and thus avoid existing procedural constraints. Thus, Republicans avoided a Senate floor confrontation over the Parliamentarian’s interpretation of the CRA by sending the question about what qualifies under the CRA back to the full Senate.

As we blogged about on February 23, 2025, Lee Zeldin, President Trump’s head of the EPA, requested a review of the rule under the CRA. Shortly thereafter, the House voted 246-164 to advance the resolution (H.J.Res.88). The vote largely followed party lines, though 35 Democrats joined Republicans in support of the measure. The Senate then advanced the resolution to President Trump for his signature in a 51-44 vote, also along party lines.

In addition to H.J.Res.88, the Senate passed two related resolutions, H.J.Res 87 and H.J. Res 89, aimed at stopping California from enforcing rules that promote zero emission truck sales and implementing stricter nitrogen oxide limits.

Repeal of Regulations

These three CRAs are among 74 resolutions Republicans in both chambers have introduced that would overturn Biden era climate rules. President Trump has signed seven CRA resolutions into law. Once a CRA resolution is enacted, a federal agency cannot propose a similar rule in the future.

Implications for State Authority and Environmental Policy

The Senate’s action represents a significant shift in the balance of federal and state powers concerning environmental regulation. This move could set a precedent affecting other areas where states have traditionally exercised autonomy under federal environmental laws.

The implications are huge. Consider, by way of example, a state like Maryland that has enacted statutes that the entire state will be greenhouse gas emission free by 2045, largely on the back of the California gasoline powered car ban; the provisions of that state law will now have no force or effect.

Stakeholders Respond

Proponents of the resolutions argue that California’s mandates could lead to increased vehicle costs and limit consumer choice nationwide. Industry groups, including the National Automobile Dealers Association, supported the Congressional action, citing concerns over market fragmentation and regulatory burdens.

Opponents, including California officials and global warming advocates, contend that the revocation undermines efforts to combat climate change and infringes upon states’ rights. California Attorney General Rob Bonta said the state “intend[s] to sue the Trump administration,” again.

But, significantly and dispositively, the CRA expressly bars judicial review of resolutions.

Conclusion

The Congressional disapproval of California’s EPA waivers marks a pivotal moment in U.S. environmental and energy policy, highlighting tensions between federal authority and initiatives led by a few states. Most expect the legal challenges anticipated in response to this action to fail, leaving this CRA saga to shape the future of environmental regulation and state federal relations in the years to come.

While Otto von Bismarck almost certainly never uttered the words, this may be a good example of, “Laws are like sausages. It is best not to see them being made.”

“UK bioethanol production supports thousands of jobs and businesses across the supply chain, and the impacts will be keenly felt if the government does not act to support this critical industry.","The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) has urged the Government to swiftly act to protect Britain’s domestic bioethanol industry.

It follows warnings from the UK’s two largest producers that the removal of tariffs on US imports could leave them unable to compete.

Vivergo Fuels in Hull and Ensus in Teesside are calling for immediate support to safeguard the hundreds of workers they directly employ, and the thousands of livelihoods they support across their supply chains – including farmers, engineers, and hauliers.

The threat stems from the UK-US trade deal, which removed a 19% tariff on US ethanol imports. While the agreement delivers clear benefits for industries such as automotive and steel, it also poses serious risks to the UK’s domestic bioethanol industry.

Ethanol has a range of uses as a raw material for sustainable aviation fuel and a component in unleaded petrol, solvents, cleaning agents and beyond.

Last week, Vivergo Managing Director Ben Hackett cautioned that without targeted support, its Saltend plant could be forced to shut down. The site is a major driver of regional employment, supporting over 4,000 jobs directly and through its supply chain – the majority in the Yorkshire and Humber region. Ensus, based in the North East, plays a similarly vital role in supporting green jobs and supplying sustainable fuels across the UK.

The BCC has welcomed the broader benefits of the new trade agreement, signed by Prime Minister Keir Starmer, but is calling on the Government to ensure that the UK’s bioethanol sector is not left behind. Targeted support is needed, they argue, to preserve thousands of jobs, maintain energy security, and uphold the UK’s transition to low-carbon fuels.

The future of biofuels will feature in the BCC Global Annual Conference this June, where senior politicians and Bank of England Governor, Andrew Bailey, will be among the headline speakers. Representatives from the bioethanol industry are also expected to attend.

Shevaun Haviland, Director General of the British Chambers of Commerce, said:

“Bioethanol production plays a vital role in the UK’s transition to clean energy and supports thousands of jobs across Teesside and the Humber.

“While the recent trade deal with the US brings opportunities for automotive and steel, it also creates challenges for our bioeconomy,

“Targeted government support is needed to safeguard this sector’s future and maintain investor confidence as we work toward our environmental and economic goals.”

Ben Hackett, Managing Director of Vivergo Fuels, said:

“Bioethanol has a vital role to play in transport decarbonisation and clean energy development for decades to come.

“UK bioethanol production supports thousands of jobs and businesses across the supply chain, and the impacts will be keenly felt if the government does not act to support this critical industry.

“We are encouraged by the engagement we have had from ministers and now need to see those warm words matched with concrete support.”

Grant Pearson, Chairman of Ensus UK, said:

“We continue to engage with the government to highlight the significant impact this deal is likely to have on bioethanol production in the UK.

“The consequences will be felt across multiple sectors — including agriculture, the food and drink industry, hospital operating theatres, nuclear power generation, the development of sustainable aviation and maritime fuels, as well as undermining the UK’s potential to decarbonise its chemical industry.”

David Hooper, External Affairs Director for Hull & Humber Chamber of Commerce, added:

“We have worked with Vivergo for years and helped them make their case to the Government, and now we’ve reached another crunch point, because of tariffs, for a business which employs 160 staff locally.

“We need decisive action from the Government now before investments go elsewhere – time is running out fast.”",https://www.britishchambers.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/blog-image-22.jpeg,N,,2025-06-01 19:03:06.799835

Toyota's C-HR+ is the latest EV among an increase in all-electric models across automakers.","Toyota just released its newest electric vehicle — the C-HR+ — in Norway, Electrek reported, and the company has been hyping it for its ""stunning"" appearance and impressive range.

While Toyota announced the vehicle in March, Norway is the first market to receive the 373-mile-range SUV. The C-HR+ could also cost less than other electric SUVs, according to Electrek, which projected it to start in the $30,000 range if it hit the U.S. in 2026.

Piotr Pawlak, president of Toyota Norway, said the C-HR+ is ""more than just a vehicle — it's a statement."" Pawlak said the vehicle was ""stunning"" and that it ""embodies Toyota's vision of blending fun-to-drive excitement with eco-conscious innovation.""

The C-HR+ comes with a 55.7 or 77 kWh battery, featuring the 373-mile range on the larger of the two batteries. The larger battery version is also available with front-wheel-drive or all-wheel-drive, making it ""the perfect electric SUV for Norwegian roads,"" according to Toyota.

Improving upon a gas-powered version of the vehicle, which was discontinued in 2022, the C-HR+ includes a roomier interior with more space for passengers and cargo. The new EV will also be Toyota's most powerful vehicle in Europe, reaching 0 to 62 miles an hour in 5.2 seconds with 343 horsepower.

While EVs can cost more than traditional vehicles initially, the C-HR+ could be more affordable and tax credits up to $7,500 can offset the price of EVs. EVs also cost less over their lifetimes, requiring less maintenance and saving 60% on annual fuel costs, according to a 2020 Consumer Reports study.

Fueling EVs with electricity produced by solar panels can increase these savings further. Installing solar panels, like EVs, may qualify you for tax credits, and EnergySage provides resources and quotes for installation. Solar panels also improve the environmental impact of EVs, since 79% of electricity comes from dirty energy resources like coal and natural gas.

Despite the resources required to charge and manufacture them, EVs are better for the environment. EVs surpass gas-fueled cars as being more environmentally friendly after 13,500 miles, one Reuters study claimed, while another MIT study found gas-fueled cars emit 350 grams of carbon per mile over their lifetimes while EVs emit just 200.

Toyota's C-HR+ is the latest EV among an increase in all-electric models across automakers. The vehicle follows Toyota's 25-year EV history and will launch in other European markets later this year. According to Electrek, ""For those in the US, we'll have to wait for the official word, but if it does arrive, which would likely be in 2026, the C-HR+ would sit below the bZ4X,"" which Electrek said would mean a price range between $30,000 and $35,000.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Toyota-C-HRimage-rec5Ip9EbUVfLNeXM-1.jpg,N,,2025-06-01 18:04:52.496747

This leaves natural gas and large nuclear plants to run 24/7 to power AI data centers.
AI data centers can be co-located in renewable-rich regions, alleviating stress on the central network.
“It boils down to the power grid,” says Jason Huang, CEO of TS Conductor, during the virtual press event.
The ultimate goal is to ensure that the clean energy supply can meet the real-time demands of data centers.","On a sunny afternoon in April, a massive power outage swept across the Iberian Peninsula. Millions were left in the dark while businesses closed, travelers were stranded, and communication lines were cut. The diagnostics are still pending, but this incident has sparked a conversation about which fuel sources are best suited to guide us as artificial intelligence and data centers experience rapid growth.

Renewables are essential, and their ability to support AI and data center growth is improving due to advancements in energy storage, grid intelligence, and demand-side innovation. However, for the foreseeable future, we must integrate clean energy sources with natural gas to ensure reliability. While green power and nuclear energy will be the backbone over time, the most optimal approach is to combine them right now.

“Thanks to a massive increase in the adoption of renewables and utility-scale battery storage in the U.S., along with the emergence of grid-enhancing technologies, our grid is better equipped to handle these stressors than it was just 5 years ago,” says Jim Spencer, chief executive of Exus Renewables North America, in an email exchange. “Renewables are essential for powering AI data centers to keep up with rapidly increasing demand, keep costs low, and drive the next wave of economic innovation.”

Political partisans blame competing energy sources for previous power outages. Inevitably, advocates of traditional fuels emphasize that wind and solar energy only function when weather conditions allow, necessitating backup from batteries or natural gas, which incurs additional costs.

In this context, renewables provided 70% of the energy during the Iberian Peninsula blackout. However, this outage cannot be attributed to wind and solar but rather to the grid's inability to respond quickly to unexpected issues. Two significant power losses occurred at substations in southwestern Spain, causing a sudden drop in power supply and affecting the grid's voltage and frequency—the heartbeat of the grid.

According to Spencer, green energy is the cheapest and quickest to integrate into the network. It works effectively alongside additional support systems like batteries, demand response, and fast-starting natural gas generation. Indeed, battery costs have dropped by more than 85% since 2010, which has improved reliability. Renewables can be co-located next to modular data centers.

“We must understand commercial readiness and cost,"" relative to when data centers come online,"" adds Ron Schoff, director of R&D for EPRI, during a United States Energy Association virtual press event I participated in. “Our big challenge is that data center demand is coming between now and the next two to three years,"" noting that the system must be able to respond to rapid changes in supply and demand for electricity.

Technically Superior Wind Turbines And Solar Panels

Consider Wind Harvest, which claims its turbines are technologically superior and designed to operate in the harshest conditions. Because its turbines continue functioning when others fail, they can generate electricity even during storms or grid stress, preventing blackouts and maintaining grid stability.

The company states that its wind mills are unique because they are vertical and closer to the ground than conventional tall horizontal turbines. Because they rotate around a vertical pole, they can handle wind from any direction. They can also operate in gusty and choppy conditions, often near the ground, where other turbines struggle.

“No one has yet made a turbine that can handle the gusty, turbulent conditions near the ground,” says Kevin Wolf, CEO of Wind Harvest, during the press event. “They didn't have the aeroelastic modeling. Our turbines can then be integrated into these wind farms, allowing for the establishment of an AI data center in California or other windy locations near the ground. We can utilize the wind when it blows and also when it is calm. This opens up an entirely new resource.”

As it stands now, renewable energy must work with other fuels to meet AI data centers’ urgent and high demands. These centers have enormous power requirements and cannot afford to go offline, necessitating high-quality and affordable battery storage or backup solutions, such as natural gas units that fire up instantly.

Meanwhile, AI is advancing, and various clean energy technologies—including long-duration storage, clean hydrogen, and small modular nuclear reactors—are not yet scalable. This leaves natural gas and large nuclear plants to run 24/7 to power AI data centers. The Trump Administration promotes coal for this purpose, although it cannot compete without substantial subsidies or regulatory favors. Coal is also inflexible and slow to ramp up, making it a mismatch.

“In a global marketplace increasingly challenged by seemingly infinite power demand driven by AI, we need an all-of-the-above approach to energy generation that expands the definition of renewable energy. This means renewable power that’s always on, locally deployable, and designed to scale. Organic waste streams hold untapped energy,” says Cornelius Shields, founder of Kore Infrastructure, in an interview.

The Utility Sector’s Mission Is Reliability

The utility sector aims to provide reliable power at the lowest rates possible. This commitment contradicts coal’s qualities, which is not just dirtier but also more expensive than renewables or natural gas. Most U.S. coal plants are decades old, and retrofitting them is too costly. Utilities make long-term decisions based on 20–40-year cost projections, while coal’s market prospects continue to decline.

Energy consumption is set to soar over the next 5 to 10 years due to the push for decarbonization and electrification and the growth of AI and data centers. To meet this challenge, we need modern grid technologies that can expand the network’s ability to handle the increased demand for electricity. At the same time, we must retire aging coal, nuclear, and natural gas plants that have been in service for four decades. Welcome, renewables, which are stepping up; solar and battery storage accounted for 81% of the electric generation capacity additions last year.

Major AI companies like Google, Microsoft, and Meta have committed to operating entirely on renewable energy. This initiative responds to investor and regulatory pressure to reduce emissions and improve environmental footprints. AI data centers can be co-located in renewable-rich regions, alleviating stress on the central network.

Guess what? Roughly 260,000 megawatts of power are poised to join the U.S. grid—more than double the current output from power plants. And here’s the reality: according to the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, 95% of this power is generated from solar, wind, and battery storage.

“It boils down to the power grid,” says Jason Huang, CEO of TS Conductor, during the virtual press event. “We do not have enough capacity in the power grid. There are plenty of bottlenecks. We have the next-generation advanced conductor available—ready to be deployed on a large scale to address that issue, in a way that brings you affordability.”

Unfortunately, the blackout in the Iberian Peninsula is not an anomaly but rather a consequence of regulatory inadequacies, grid technologies, and extreme weather events. Adding electricity demand to these existing dynamics only heightens the challenges and opportunities, necessitating greater research and development in cutting-edge grid and energy technologies. The ultimate goal is to ensure that the clean energy supply can meet the real-time demands of data centers.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/681fccc6dadc77fdbda07136/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-06-01 18:05:00.341944

“We need to address environmental issues and then get the site up to grade level and take the fence down so it could actually be used again.","The City of Astoria has received a $2 million Brownfields Cleanup Grant from the Environmental Protection Agency — the latest step in a yearslong effort to address industrial pollution at Heritage Square downtown.

For decades, the site on Exchange Street was a hub for industrial activities, ranging from auto repair and paint sales to drycleaning and print operations. Now, a parking lot and large pit remain, and beneath the surface lie volatile organic compounds and petroleum hydrocarbons well beyond EPA standards.

For years, that pollution has left the site undevelopable and inaccessible to the public.

“Anytime you have a property … if you do have environmental issues that need to be addressed, it’s difficult to redevelop property,” said City Manager Scott Spence.

Over the past two decades, the city has conducted environmental assessments and remedial planning at the site. The new cleanup grant — the largest EPA award in the city’s history — will help pave the way for mitigating pollution and filling the pit to bring it to grade-level.

The work fits into a broader process of envisioning a future for the site as a public gathering space. Last year, the City Council approved a memorandum of understanding with Friends of Heritage Square, a local group that has pushed for a public gathering space. In the months since, the city has worked with First Forty Feet, a Portland-based firm, to create a plan for the development of a public space and help guide a public engagement process.

Ideas for the space have included park amenities, community events and the expansion of the Astoria Sunday Market.

“Really, this is the first step if we’re going to reclaim the space for the community,” Spence said. “We need to address environmental issues and then get the site up to grade level and take the fence down so it could actually be used again. … So by getting this grant, this is a significant initiative to be able to achieve that overall vision.”

Spence said the city will be finalizing the grant agreement in the next few months, and then will begin design work to address environmental remediation at the site. Construction could begin next year.",https://dailyastorian.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/7f335ef64e2a9ce0b15aebf57d1bdd42.jpg,N,,2025-06-01 18:05:39.905846

I’m also talking about economic sustainability.
Economic sustainability ensures a business can withstand short-term market fluctuations and future uncertainties to be resilient and profitable over the long term.
But a company that instills economic, environmental and social sustainability into its operations, products, service and projects will unlock abundant business advantages.
Where do clarity, certainty, stability and sustainability fit in today’s political climate?","Clarity. Certainty. Stability.

That’s what businesses need to grow — and that’s what’s being undermined by federal policy shifts and inaction. Federal clean energy incentives are being cut and tax credits eviscerated. Climate mitigation and adaptation programs are being phased out. Science and environmental safeguards are under attack.

As a corporate D.C. lobbyist during the noughties, I saw policy priorities come and go with every election, but these three little words were baked into every talking point, press release and policy pitch. In a business context, clear laws and regulations instill certainty, confidence and predictability that lead to stable financial conditions, all of which are crucial for making informed decisions and investments.

These bedrocks of business planning are being tested like never before by political mayhem, relentless executive orders and an elevated trade war with more losers than benefits. However, despite politicians trying to disrupt the economic world order, and too many executives and billionaires either leading the charge or staying under cover to avoid the bullets, most U.S. businesses retain these principles at their core to better recognize economic trends, influence consumer behavior and counter competitor activity. Businesses that invest in innovation and adapt to changing market conditions are better positioned to thrive in uncertain times like these, and beyond.

In this world of political chaos and disruption, businesses must embrace a fourth tenet to survive and remain not only economically viable, but profitable and successful. Over the past decade, “sustainability” has graduated from a corporate buzzword to a necessary long-term strategy. I’m not talking just environmental and social sustainability, although both are increasingly important. I’m also talking about economic sustainability.

Economic sustainability ensures a business can withstand short-term market fluctuations and future uncertainties to be resilient and profitable over the long term. Profit should not completely overshadow the environmental and social practices, as a business cannot thrive if natural and human resources are left behind. But a company that instills economic, environmental and social sustainability into its operations, products, service and projects will unlock abundant business advantages.

Operational advantages include improved energy efficiency, waste and water reduction and cleaner vehicle fleets that reduce costs and enrich the bottom line. Sales advantages included enhanced brand reputation and customer loyalty with consumers willing to change their purchasing habits to reduce environmental impact. Investment advantages include better risk planning and management portfolios. Human advantages include more productive and loyal employees.

Where do clarity, certainty, stability and sustainability fit in today’s political climate?

First, when we engage with businesses, policymakers and other decision makers on energy and climate issues, we need to lead with solutions that benefit both the economy and the environment and make that link crystal clear in our communications and strategies. Otherwise, we end up with “big beautiful bills,” such as the mess that recently emerged from the U.S. House of Representatives.

At a business forum I hosted after President Trump’s first election win in 20216, a top energy lobbyist assured the audience, “For those concerned, don’t panic. For those excited, don’t get too euphoric.” The world was already on an irreversible path to cleaner energy and more sustainable business practices. While federal policy may slow the momentum, the progress will continue. After recent environmental rollbacks and energy incentive raids, I might add, “For those motivated, don’t stop!” American businesses are at the forefront of technology and innovation — they are motivated and will not stop.

Second, look to the stats and trends. American consumers are willing to pay, on average, 11% more for sustainable products. Seventy-five percent of executives believe sustainability drives better business results. For every 10% increase in emphasis on material ESG (environment, social, governance) concerns, a company’s value goes up by 1.4%.

Third, after the COVID-19 pandemic, a mere dress-rehearsal for climate change impacts, businesses intensified their efforts to save and make money in a future carbon-constrained economy. Despite congressional efforts to hide and insulate America from world trade, global action will proceed and American companies will need to do more than keep up — they will need to lead.

If we create a sound sustainability business model, and build a movement with all types, sizes and geographic locations of companies with community leaders of all political persuasions, we can make true progress, no matter who sits in the White House or Congress. Rather than assuming a “none of my business” approach to climate and the economy, sustainability helps carve a clear, certain and stable path that can be everyone’s business.",https://w2pcms.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/03/AP16272858411559.jpg?w=800,N,,2025-06-01 18:05:33.273908

With the contentious bill now headed for the Senate, some energy experts are warning of dire consequences for some renewable energy industries if it becomes law. To wit, the sweeping policy bill seeks to phase out billions in tax credits for the budding green hydrogen and EV battery industries. Created under the Inflation Reduction Act during the Biden administration, the Section 45V tax credit has been a major boon for low-carbon hydrogen and ammonia projects across the country.

This could be profound: a total of 46 hydrogen and ammonia-related projects were qualified to receive 45V tax benefits in Louisiana alone, including massive builds from Air Products & Chemicals (NYSE:APD), Clean Hydrogen Works and Bia Energy.

Over the past couple of years, Louisiana has emerged as the country’s leading hydrogen hub, focused on industry growth and sustainability. The state is home to some of the largest hydrogen projects in the country, including Clean Hydrogen Works' $7.5 billion ammonia and blue hydrogen project slated to create 1,472 jobs; Air Products' $4.5 billion blue hydrogen plant; Bia Energy Operating Company's $550 million blue hydrogen project and Monarch Energy's $426 million green hydrogen project.

Losing 45V tax credits may seriously erode the economic viability of these companies: according to company filings, Air Products received $19.7 million in federal tax credits in 2024, with the company’s federal tax credit claims jumping nearly 40% between 2020 and 2024. That’s perhaps not a coincidence when you consider that the 45V program kicked off in 2021 after former President Joe Biden passed the IRA.

With over 10 million tons of gross annual output, Illinois-based CF Industries (NYSE:CF) is one of the largest ammonia producers in the world, with Louisiana accounting for half of the company’s output. CF has already secured renewable energy certificates that qualify its pilot electrolyzer project for 45V tax credits when operational. When asked about the impact of the termination of 45V credits, Ryan Stiles, who manages the company’s ammonia production, said that some customers are likely to be less tolerant of paying more for low-carbon ammonia without the 45V subsidies.

The hydrogen sector heavyweight, Plug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG), only began operations in Louisiana a month ago; however, the company has previously flagged the importance of the 45V credit, stating that any limitation “could be materially adverse to the Company and its near-term hydrogen generation projects.”

Yet another provision in Trump’s big bill would spell doom for Section 48 Investment Tax Credit for certain clean energy technologies, ending eligibility for the credits in 2032--three years earlier than the IRA intended.

On a brighter note, the bill still provides tax credits for carbon capture and sequestration under Section 45Q.

“We expect our investment into the Donaldsonville CCS project will increase our free cash flow in the range of $100 million per year due to the United States’ 45Q tax credit for permanently sequestering CO2,” CF Industries said in its annual report.

CF Industries is not the only energy company that will be counting its lucky stars for Trump’s big bill leaving CCS credits intact. Big Oil has invested considerable capital into carbon capture projects, including Exxon Mobil’s (NYSE:XOM) latest CCS project targeting power-hungry U.S. data centers. The Oil & Gas giant has unveiled a groundbreaking plan wherein the company will provide low-carbon power to the U.S. data centers powering the AI boom. Exxon’s proposal outlines a first-of-its-kind facility that will use natural gas to produce electricity while capturing more than 90% of the CO2 emissions. The captured emissions will then be stored deep underground. ExxonMobil’s current CCS technology supports industries involved in steel, hydrogen and ammonia production, with the company having secured agreements to store up to 6.7 million tons of CO2 annually for these sectors.

Meanwhile, last month, Shell (NYSE:SHEL), Equinor (NYSE:EQNR), and TotalEnergies (NYSE:TTE) expanded their Northern Lights CCS project with $714 million in total investments. The decision comes after a deal with Swedish energy company, Stockholm Exergi, which has pledged to send up to 900,000 tonnes of CO? each year over a 5-year span. With the additional investment, Northern Lights is now capable of storing at least 5 million tonnes of CO? per year, more than triple the original target of 1.5 million tonnes.

WASHINGTON, D.C. — In yet another politically motivated abuse of emergency authorities that will raise consumers’ utility bills, the U.S. Department of Energy issued an order late on Friday to force a coal power plant to continue operating. Eddystone, owned by Constellation Energy, operates two coal units just outside Philadelphia. The move is the second time in two weeks that the Trump administration has moved to keep a coal powerplant in a state with a Democratic governor slated as a Presidential front-runner open after it was set to close.

On February 27, 2024, PJM approved Constellation’s request, writing that it “did not identify any reliability violations resulting from the proposed deactivation of the Eddystone Generating Units #3&4. Because there are no reliability violations associated with the deactivation of this generator … the generating unit may deactivate on May 31, 2025, or sooner if desired.” But in a craven, politically-motivated about face, PJM issued a statement praising Trump’s forced bailout of an uneconomic coal power plant that will cost working families higher energy bills.

If the tax credits were to go away, what happens to that fight when it comes to climate change?","AYESHA RASCOE, HOST:

There's been a boom in clean energy across the U.S. - solar panels popping up on rooftops, wind farms dotting hillsides. Technology has improved. Prices have fallen, but there's also been hefty federal subsidies. Now, that GOP spending bill of President Trump's that passed the House, that would end federal tax credits for solar and other types of clean energy. We wondered what the effects might be on energy costs for consumers. That's where Doug Lewin comes in. He's a clean energy consultant and host of the ""Energy Capital"" podcast, and he joins us now from Austin. Welcome to the program.

DOUG LEWIN: Hey. Thanks for having me.

RASCOE: So remind us what all these tax credits are about and why do some Republicans - including, you know, all the lawmakers who voted for this bill - oppose these tax credits.

LEWIN: Yeah, so they come in two different flavors. There's the investment tax credit, which is 30% of the cost of an entire project. And then there's what's called a production tax credit. So for every megawatt hour, every unit of energy produced, there's a payment that goes to those sources. Why they don't like them? I mean, you know, there's a number of stated reasons. I think the most usual stated reason is they don't like subsidies. But I don't think we saw in the, you know, quote-unquote, ""big, beautiful bill"" any reduction in tax credits for oil and gas, some of which have been around for over a hundred years. So, you know, it's hard for me to sort of represent what they're thinking on this 'cause I don't think it makes a lot of sense.

RASCOE: Well, how could this affect people's electric bills? Because I think a lot of people, when you think of solar and wind and stuff like that, you think coal is, like, cheap. So if these - you know, if we're using more coal or gas, people might think that might help their electric bills, but how will this actually affect electric bills?

LEWIN: Yeah, so electric bills would go up. There's some really good modeling on this. Jesse Jenkins, out of Princeton at his NEX Lab (ph), did modeling. And I focus on Texas. I look right away at Texas, and electric costs would go up something like 17% in the next four or five years. And the reason for that, Ayesha, is that, like, actually, where we are now, renewables are cheaper than alternative sources of energy like coal and gas. And I use that term alternative very intentionally because we used to refer to renewables as alternative. But if you look globally, last year, 90% of what was installed was wind, solar or storage - globally, 90%. And it's not because of environmental factors that may factor in here or there, but it's mostly because of economics. The International Energy Agency said in 2022 that solar was the cheapest form of electricity ever, and that was three years ago. The costs have come down even more, and we've seen huge cost declines in batteries. So pairing renewables with batteries is really a fantastic solution, just for grid reliability and affordability, to say nothing of having lower emissions.

RASCOE: The White House calls these tax credits a green corporate welfare subsidy. Given that clean energy is a pretty mature industry now, should it really be the recipient of U.S. tax dollars?

LEWIN: Look, here's the way I think of this - every single energy source we have is subsidized. Nuclear is the most subsidized form of energy ever. No nuclear plant gets built without government support. Oil and gas - again, the oil and gas industry is a pretty mature industry, but we still have subsidies available for it. Why do we have subsidies for energy? Because people like low-cost energy. So if you want to take away subsidies, it's going to be a very unpopular thing to do. They're going to have a lot of very angry constituents, very angry business owners. So, yeah, if we want to get rid of the subsidies, let's get rid of all of them, and everybody's energy will go up 50% or 100%, and you'll have people out in the streets with pitchforks, and then they'll put the subsidies back in place.

RASCOE: Do you believe that there is a conservative argument for supporting clean energy? I mean, as you said, you're based in Texas. That's a pretty red state. What is the argument to Republican lawmakers that, you know, supporting clean energy is beneficial?

LEWIN: Oh, I think there's absolutely a conservative argument. I mean, you can just start with most of the economic - the direct economic benefits of wind and solar installations are happening in Republican districts. Something like 80% of the benefits of those tax credits is flowing to Republican areas of the country. So that's one of them, is just the benefits to rural economies all across this country.

RASCOE: Well, I mean, that's definitely a different pitch for renewables because in many ways, the tax credits were intended to speed up the transition away from fossil fuels and to help fight climate change. If the tax credits were to go away, what happens to that fight when it comes to climate change?

LEWIN: Well, you know, it's very interesting. I actually think, particularly at the moment we're at right now in 2025, climate is obviously a very important concern, but it's actually secondary or even tertiary to economic growth. There is no way we are going to win the AI race against China without developing massive amounts of power. Right now, economic growth and lower emissions are possible in a way that they weren't even certainly 10 years ago, and probably even three or four years ago. And that trend is actually accelerating. It's actually becoming more and more true that we can both increase economic growth and lower emissions at the same time.

RASCOE: That's Doug Lewin, CEO of Stoic Energy Consulting. Thank you so much for being with us.

LEWIN: Thanks, Ayesha.

Urgent Call to Action As smoke from Canada’s wildfires continues to choke U.S. cities, the crisis serves as a stark reminder of the interconnected nature of climate change.
Without significant intervention, the vicious cycle of wildfires, air pollution, and climate change will only intensify.","As Canada grapples with an intensifying wildfire season, the smoke from sprawling blazes in its prairie provinces is casting a hazardous pall over the United States, raising alarms about deteriorating air quality and the escalating impacts of climate change.

The record-breaking fires, fueled by unusually warm and dry conditions, have already burned vast swaths of land, prompting evacuations, emergency declarations, and renewed focus on the cross-border environmental and health consequences of a warming planet.

A Record-Breaking Fire Season

The 2025 wildfire season in Canada has continued the alarming trend of recent years, with massive blazes erupting across Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta, and British Columbia. In Manitoba alone, wildfires have consumed approximately 200,000 hectares (494,000 acres) this year—three times the province’s recent full-year average. The Bird River and Border fires in northern Manitoba remain uncontained, while the Caribou Lake fire in Alberta has added to the crisis. The Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre reports that 40 of the 146 active fires are burning “out of control,” with forecasts predicting above-average fire activity through the spring and summer due to persistent drought and high temperatures.

These fires follow the devastating 2023 season, which saw 7.8 million hectares burned—six times the annual average since 2001—and produced carbon emissions nearly four times those of the global aviation sector in 2022. The 2023 fires, concentrated in western Canada and Quebec, sent smoke plumes as far as Europe and China, underscoring the global reach of Canada’s wildfire crisis. This year’s early-season intensity suggests 2025 could rival or exceed those records, driven by climate conditions that experts warn are becoming the new norm.

Climate Change as a Catalyst

While wildfires are a natural part of Canada’s boreal forest ecosystem, their frequency, size, and severity are increasing due to human-driven climate change. Warmer springs, longer dry seasons, and reduced snowpack have created tinderbox conditions across Canada’s forests. In 2023, temperatures in northwest Canada were 4.5°F (2.6°C) above average, with precipitation 3 inches below normal, setting the stage for extreme fire activity. Similar patterns in 2025, exacerbated by a weakening jet stream that allows smoke to linger, have intensified the crisis.

Natural Resources Canada reports that fire conditions are currently at their maximum severity across affected regions, with climate models projecting a doubling of burned areas by the end of the century if emissions remain high. Drought, invasive insects, and dead trees have further increased fuel loads, making fires more intense and harder to control. Manitoba Premier Wab Kinew, declaring a province-wide state of emergency, noted, “This is the largest evacuation Manitoba will have seen in most people’s living memory… a sign of a changing climate that we are going to have to adapt to.”

Cross-Border Air Quality Impacts

The smoke from Canada’s wildfires is drifting south, threatening air quality across the U.S. Midwest, Northeast, and mid-Atlantic regions. Cities like Chicago, Detroit, and Washington, D.C., are bracing for air quality index (AQI) levels reaching the “red” category (AQI > 150), indicating unhealthy conditions for all groups. In 2023, smoke from eastern Canada’s fires turned New York City’s skies orange, briefly making it the world’s most polluted city, with PM2.5 levels peaking at 258.9 μg/m³—17.3 times the World Health Organization’s guideline of 15 μg/m³. Similar impacts are expected this year as smoke continues to billow across the border.

Wildfire smoke contains fine particulate matter (PM2.5), ozone precursors, and toxic compounds like polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which are linked to cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, strokes, and even fertility issues. A recent study found that exposure to wildfire smoke can affect heart and lung health for months after the smoke clears, posing a growing public health threat. In the U.S., climate-driven wildfires have already reversed decades of air quality improvements, contributing to an estimated 15,000 PM2.5-related deaths between 2006 and 2020, with a $160 billion economic burden.

Health and Societal Impacts

The health risks are particularly acute for vulnerable groups, including children, the elderly, and those with preexisting conditions. In 2023, over 100 million people in the U.S. were under air quality alerts, with cancellations of school outings, sporting events, and even White House activities. This year, the Canadian military is airlifting 17,000 people from fire zones, while First Nations communities in Saskatchewan face evacuations and road closures. In the U.S., officials are urging residents to limit outdoor activity, wear masks, and use air purifiers to mitigate smoke exposure.

The economic toll is also significant. Canada’s 2023 wildfires caused billions in property damage and disrupted timber supplies, while the U.S. has spent over $3.5 billion annually on firefighting efforts. As wildfires grow, they threaten critical infrastructure, water systems, and ecosystems, with long-term consequences for carbon sinks like Canada’s forests, which may lose their capacity to absorb CO2 if fire activity continues to rise.

Adapting to a Fiery Future

Experts emphasize that while wildfires are not directly caused by climate change, the conditions fueling their intensity—heat, drought, and dry vegetation—are strongly linked to human-induced warming. The Fourth National Climate Assessment warns that over 100 million Americans live in areas with unhealthy air pollution, a problem worsened by wildfires. Mitigation strategies, such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving forest management, and discouraging development in fire-prone areas, are critical to curbing future risks.

In Canada, authorities are enhancing fire monitoring with satellites, drones, and AI-driven risk prediction to optimize firefighting resources. The U.S. is also investing in resilience, with California’s 2009 Climate Adaptation Strategy serving as a model for addressing wildfire-related air quality threats through better land management and public awareness.

Urgent Call to Action

As smoke from Canada’s wildfires continues to choke U.S. cities, the crisis serves as a stark reminder of the interconnected nature of climate change. President Joe Biden, reflecting on the 2023 fires, called them a “stark reminder of the impacts of climate change,” a sentiment echoed by experts who urge global action to curb emissions. Posts on social media capture public concern, with users describing hazy skies and health impacts, while calling for stronger climate policies.

Without significant intervention, the vicious cycle of wildfires, air pollution, and climate change will only intensify. For now, communities on both sides of the border are left to navigate the immediate challenges of smoke-filled skies, while the long-term fight for a cooler, cleaner future remains urgent.",https://www.bbntimes.com/images/Canadian_Wildfires_Worsen_Threatening_US_Air_Quality_Amid_Climate_Change-Driven_Conditions.jpg,N,,2025-06-01 19:03:22.744738

Cheaper batteries mean cheaper EVs, and electric cars and trucks remain the main driver of battery demand.

China’s price advantage is widening over the rest of the world.

The war for a zero-emission future of transportation is really a war for batteries. If battery prices—the biggest single cost of any electric vehicle—remain high, then EVs will stay expensive. But if batteries can be made or secured cheaply and locally, prices will decline.

Tesla figured this out early on with its Gigafactory in Nevada. It's also why automakers like General Motors, Toyota and Ford are planning battery plants of their own—to varying degrees of success thus far.

But as every automaker, battery supplier and energy provider races toward that future, here's some good news: global prices for lithium-ion battery packs fell 20% in 2024, according to a new study from the International Energy Agency (IEA). That's the biggest single price drop since 2017.

You can thank increased competition, more production and growing demand for this situation. ""Lithium prices, in particular, dropped nearly 20% in 2024, reaching similar prices to those at the end of 2015, despite lithium demand in 2024 being about six times bigger than in 2015,"" the report said.

The low prices of critical minerals are due to current surpluses, which is good news for EV costs in the near-term but could lead to under-investment in the future.

Battery Prices (IEA)

Battery pack prices fell in all markets, the report said. But the biggest drops were in—and probably not surprisingly—China. That country has a significant lead in the battery race, both in terms of securing the supply chain and overall technological development.

""China was responsible for 80% of global battery cell production in 2024, while the remainder was produced in the United States, the European Union, Korea and Japan,"" the study said. ""The faster pace of battery cost reduction and innovation in China has been enabled by fierce competition that has driven down profit margins for most producers (though not all), at the same time as driving up manufacturing efficiency and yields, as well as access to a large, skilled workforce.""

Interestingly, that study also notes that contrary to what you may think, hybrid batteries are more expensive than EV batteries, despite being significantly smaller. ""The price of such components is spread across fewer battery cells, increasing the price per kilowatt-hour,"" the study said. ""In 2024, the average price of a 20 kWh PHEV battery pack—roughly the global sales-weighted average for standard plug-in hybrids—was about the same as a 65 kWh BEV battery pack.""

China's near-total lead on lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries is having a big impact on the market as well. While LFP batteries have long been considered a lower-cost option for EVs, their performance has improved significantly through continued development, making them far more suited for mainstream mass-market car duty than ever.

LFP batteries made up nearly half of the global EV battery market, the study said, also attributable to China. Their use grew by about 90% in 2024 in the European Union, but remained at only 10% in the United States, due to anti-China tariffs. Meanwhile, LFP batteries are sort of taking over the rest of the world.

""Market penetration of LFP batteries is moving even faster in other markets,"" the study said. ""In Southeast Asia, Brazil and India, the share of electric car batteries using LFP reached more than 50% in 2024. In Southeast Asia and Brazil, LFP uptake is led by imports from China, mostly by BYD, whereas in India it is driven by cars produced domestically, led by Tata Motors."" Meanwhile, LFP battery development is moving more quickly in South Korea and Japan as well.

LFP vs NMC battery adoption

Onto more good news and bad news. On the first front, the U.S. is slowly beginning to catch up. ""Manufacturing capacity in the United States grew by almost 50%, led by Korean companies attracted by tax credits, which accounted for nearly 70% of the growth in 2024,"" the study said. ""This led installed capacity in the United States to surpass that in the European Union, which nonetheless increased by 10% in 2024 despite the Northvolt plant in Sweden being halted following its bankruptcy.""

However, those tax credits could very likely go away soon if President Donald Trump's budget bill is signed into law. The so-called Big, Beautiful Bill is poised to eliminate both EV tax credits and tax incentives for domestic battery manufacturing. A current version passed by the U.S. House of Representatives cuts both; it is now working its way through the Senate.

Ultimately, the global battery boom isn't going anywhere. But whether America wants to have a place in it remains to be seen.

While Environment Minister Murray Watt’s decision to grant the approval for Woodside’s North West Shelf extension in Western Australia’s Pilbara has been praised by industry and unions, others have condemned it due to the threat to the Murujuga cultural heritage.

President of the Uniting Church in Australia, Rev Charissa Suli told reporters in Perth on Sunday, she is “profoundly disappointed” about the approval of the North West Shelf gas processing facility.

“As a daughter of the Pacific, I have witnessed first-hand the devastating impacts of climate change on culturally rich but environmentally vulnerable nations in our region,” she said.

“These nations — many of which are home to Uniting Church partners within the Asia-Pacific — contribute the least to global emissions yet suffer the greatest consequences.

“Why then is approval granted to an old, polluting facility to continue emitting vast

volumes of climate damaging emissions of a magnitude many times greater than the

emissions of all the Pacific nations? This is not loving thy neighbour.”

Rev Mitchell Garlett from the Uniting Aboriginal & Islander Christian Congress added he is “very disappointed” that the decision was made without “close consultation with the relevant Traditional Owners”.

“The connection we feel to Country is not just a physical thing but a spiritual connection that is deeper than what we see with our eyes,” he said.

“It is heartbreaking that reconciliation is spoken of but our brothers and sisters voices are not being heard, and the land continues to suffer for so-called progress.”

Rev Dr Ian Tozer added they are “deeply concerned” by the threat to First Nations cultural heritage sites, including 60,000-year-old priceless petroglyphs at the World Heritage nominated Murujuga rock art site.

“It is vital that these ancient sites, so precious to Australia’s First Peoples and to our history, are not further damaged by industry,” he said.

Meanwhile, Woodside has said the approval would support thousands of jobs and supply affordable energy to Western Australia.

The project has supplied 6000 petajoules of domestic gas, powering homes and industry in Western Australia with enough energy to power homes in a city the size of Perth for approximately 175 years, the company said.

In response to the perceived soullessness of electric vehicles, Kafantaris founded Hyperion in 2011 in Columbus, Ohio.
Though the Energy Policy Act of 1992 classifies hydrogen as an alternative fuel, hydrogen fuel cells are currently too costly to appeal to most consumers.
The administration says the United States only has about 60 fueling stations for hydrogen vehicles, and all of those are in California.
And though California is leading the way in increasing accessibility, hydrogen fuel for a mass audience is still decades away.","Angelo Kafantaris is an old-school car guy. He’s the founder and CEO of Hyperion Motors, makers of the world’s first 1,000-mile alternative-fuel vehicle, the XP-1. Unlike most other alternative fuel vehicles on the market, the XP-1 taps into the growing interest in green hydrogen and uses hydrogen fuel cells to power its prototype.

Kafantaris — who grew up fixing cars with his father and who has a deep and abiding love for Detroit — is unapologetic about his fascination with legacy automobiles.

“In the U.S., we have an anthropomorphized relationship with cars,” he says. “There are masculine cars. There are feminine cars. We talk about cars making noises, having smells and giving off vibrations. To me, it’s the ultimate product.”

In the last few decades, Kafantaris said, the automotive industry has lost its way. Though electric vehicles are arguably better for the environment, they’ve sacrificed the elements that traditional car lovers enjoy — the noise, the vibration, the sense of power. Outside of quick acceleration and the ability to move people from place to place, electric vehicles have nothing to do with the power and verve of a gas-powered car. “EVs are almost soulless to true car people,” Kafantaris says.

In response to the perceived soullessness of electric vehicles, Kafantaris founded Hyperion in 2011 in Columbus, Ohio. The company relocated to California in 2015 to take advantage of California’s growing investment in hydrogen infrastructure for personal vehicles, and Hyperion unveiled the XP-1 in 2020. Several of Hyperion’s investors are based in Naples, said Edison Awards’ Executive Director Frank Bonafilia. This year, the company was a finalist at the Fort Myers-based Edison Awards, which honors excellence in innovation.

Kafantaris has a background in mechanical engineering and industrial design — including a stint at Mattel, where he worked on the Hot Wheels line — and he brings an appreciation for both form and function to his design process. “To create a truly remarkable product, the end result needs to not only work beautifully but be aesthetically pleasing, as well,” he says. “This means touch and feel, as well as viewer interface.”

The XP-1’s striking design features a carbon fiber titanium chassis, adjustable solar air blade, high-voltage fuel cells, axial flux motors and a two-ring exhaust that produces a blue-flame effect. Kafantaris calls it “the perfect compromise between zero emissions and automotive traditions.” It has all the components that make cars exciting to people, both aesthetically and mechanically. Plus, he said, it feels like a spaceship.

Kafantaris acknowledges that the United States has a ways to go before it reaches zero emissions, but Hyperion is doing its part to move the nation one step closer to a green hydrogen economy. He refers to the XP-1 as a lightning strike: a brilliant, captivating piece of machinery meant to tease the imagination and bring traditional car lovers to the world of alternative fuels. “We have everything that an electric car offers without — pardon my French — the boringness.”

The Growing Hydrogen Economy

According to a 2023 report released by Deloitte, the global value of the green hydrogen market is expected to reach $1.4 trillion by 2050. The same report predicts the hydrogen industry will support 2 million jobs around the world each year between 2030 and 2050. This will lead to a significant reduction in cumulative carbon emissions — 85 gigatons, according to the report, which is more than twice the amount of global CO2 emissions produced in 2021. But this forward-looking green hydrogen economy comes at a steep cost. Deloitte estimates that more than $9 trillion of investment is needed in the global hydrogen supply chain to achieve these results. Of that $9 trillion, $3.1 trillion would need to go to developing economies.

Too Good to be True?

Advocates tout the benefits of green hydrogen for both the economy and the environment, but is the United States ready for hydrogen as a fuel source for personal vehicles? Not yet, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Though the Energy Policy Act of 1992 classifies hydrogen as an alternative fuel, hydrogen fuel cells are currently too costly to appeal to most consumers. Plus, key infrastructure is lacking. The administration says the United States only has about 60 fueling stations for hydrogen vehicles, and all of those are in California.

Rudzinski also called for Governor Whitmer to take a public stance on the proposal. ""Governor Whitmer has never publicly weighed in on Enbridge’s oil tunnel proposal, and we really need her to break her silence and show leadership on behalf of the people of Michigan. That means making sure that EGLE is actually scrutinizing the project with an eye toward the Submerged Bottomlands Act, and what this drilling and blasting would mean for the Great Lakes,"" she said.

Enbridge, the company behind the project, issued a statement acknowledging the draft's release. ""We appreciate the extensive technical work that went into this document and the opportunity to contribute detailed responses to numerous data and information requests—demonstrating our commitment to transparency and environmental, social and cultural responsibility,"" the statement read.

Enbridge also emphasized its goal to minimize environmental impact, stating, ""The tunnel design already reflects that intent, and we will use the USACE’s findings from the DEIS to further refine the project.""

On May 28, intellectual property (IP) policy advocacy group the Council for Innovation Promotion (C4IP) published the second edition of its Congressional Innovation Scorecard, a detailed assessment of Congressional engagement with legislative efforts on IP protections and related policies. Although this year’s edition highlighted a larger number of pro-IP voices in Congress, a majority of U.S. Senators and Representatives are still earning poor grades indicating a lack of engagement with issues that are critical to the future of America’s innovation economy.

Sens. Tillis and Coons, Rep. Moran are Only Politicians Graded ‘A+’ for Innovation

C4IP makes clear near the top of its Congressional scorecard that a member of Congress must be pro-IP to rate highly as pro-innovation. Calling the innovation system “America’s 401(K) — the investment vehicle through which we secure future prosperity,” C4IP notes that the responsibility for nurturing the IP system “falls heavily on the shoulders of Congress.” While placing greater emphasis on legislative actions taken during the recently concluded 118th Congress, the Congressional scorecard also takes into account relevant past activity from the 117th Congress and 116th Congress.

Among the key findings of C4IP’s scorecard is that a clear majority of Congress has only limited interest in advancing pro-IP legislation and policy. More than half of members of Congress received a grade of ‘C’ or lower, with nearly 7% of Congress earning a grade of ‘D’ or lower. This year’s scorecard did indicate some improvement, with the number of pro-IP Senators increasing past 20 in addition to 22 pro-IP Representatives identified.

In particular, C4IP’s Congressional scorecard lauds the efforts of Senators Thom Tillis (R-NC) and Chris Coons (D-DE) in advancing national IP policy in a positive direction through 2024. Both Senators earned a grade of ‘A+’ and were closely followed by three Senators earning ‘A’ grades for their increasingly positive engagement with IP policy: Mazie Hirono (D-HI); Marsha Blackburn (R-TN); and Tom Cotton (R-AR). While noting that Tillis and Coons have demonstrated unmatched positive pro-IP activity, C4IP also gave an ‘A+’ grade to Representative Nathaniel Moran (R-TX) for consistent support of pro-IP activities. Six U.S. Representatives also earned ‘A’ grades including Ben Cline (R-VA), Hank Johnson (D-GA), Kevin Kiley (R-CA), Madeleine Dean (D-PA), Scott Peters (D-CA) and Deborah Ross (D-NC).

States With Higher Percentage of Private R&D Workforce Only Maintain ‘C’ Grades

IP-intensive industries are important to every state, with U.S. Patent and Trademark Office data cited by C4IP showing that such industries account for anywhere from 23% to 37% of the private sector workforce in those states. Despite this clear interest in pro-IP efforts that could bolster their private sectors even more, only two states had average scores of ‘B+’ or above across their entire Congressional delegation: Delaware (‘A’); and Idaho (‘B+’). As C4IP points out, poor scores across the board highlight a clear disconnect between the high economic importance of IP-intensive industries and the importance of pro-IP efforts. Indeed, each of the eight states in which IP-intensive industries employ more than 35% of the private sector workforce only scored a ‘C’ average: California (35.1%); Illinois (35.5%); Massachusetts (35.7%); Michigan (35.3%); New York (35.8%); Utah (37%); Washington (36.7%); and Wisconsin (35.2%).

C4IP’s Congressional scorecard identifies several pieces of pro-IP legislation currently before the Senate and House of Representatives. Among these particularly consequential bills are the Patent Eligibility Restoration Act (PERA), a bill sponsored by Tillis and Coons to address the untenable uncertainties posed by the current state of patent-eligibility law, and the Promoting and Respecting Economically Vital American Innovation Leadership (PREVAIL) Act, which addresses unpredictability stemming from inter partes review (IPR) proceedings conducted at the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB). C4IP also advocated for bringing back the presumption of injunctive relief for parties proving infringement through passage of the Realizing Engineering, Science, and Technology Opportunities by Restoring Exclusive (RESTORE) Patent Rights Act.

Several bills that would negatively impact IP rights for Americans are also being debated by Congress, C4IP cautioned. The Affordable Prescriptions for Patients Act and similar bills addressing so-called “patent thickets” are premised on anti-IP logic that presumes fewer IP protections will naturally lead to greater consumer access, especially for pharmaceuticals. Such logic is undercut by the realities of the COVID-19 pandemic, C4IP argues, given the unimaginably rapid pace of vaccine development thanks in large part to the collaborative environment created by mutual respect for IP rights covering the vaccine’s building blocks.",https://ipwatchdog.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Depositphotos_45526763_S.jpg,N,,2025-06-01 14:05:40.793085

Denmark's current vehicle tax system provides several incentives for zero-emission vehicles. The registration tax for private cars is calculated progressively: 25 percent of the first 72,900 Danish kroner (11,089 U.S. dollars) in 2025, 85 percent of the value between 72,900 and 226,500 Danish kroner, and 150 percent of the remaining value.

For zero-emission vehicles such as electric cars emitting zero CO2, only 40 percent of the calculated tax is payable if the car is registered before 2026, with this rate gradually increasing until full taxation applies in 2035. Additionally, zero-emission cars receive a basic deduction of 165,000 Danish kroner in 2025 from the vehicle registration tax.

The Istanbul-based company has “all the capacity and capability to execute projects on its own”, Mustafa Kocar, chief executive of Kalyon Holding, said.
“The target is to complete natural gas power plants in three years after financial closure, which maybe four years from today.
“We are really happy to contribute to the development of Syria after the new situation,” Mr Ata said.
Global expansion in construction Meanwhi, Kalyon Holding is also eyeing opportunities in other verticals of its business including in construction, according to Mr Kocar.","Turkey's Kalyon Enerji, in which Abu Dhabi’s International Holding Company has a 50 per cent stake, aims to grow its renewable energy portfolio globally, after signing a $7 billion deal in Syria to construct new power plants in the war-torn country.

Kalyon Enerji is co-owned by Turkish conglomerate Kalyon Holding, which has interests in several sectors including construction, energy and aviation.

“Our renewable portfolio at the moment is more than 2 gigawatts in operation but, in the coming five years, our target is to increase our portfolio to 5 gigawatts,” Kalyon Enerji's chief executive Murtaza Ata said in Istanbul.

“We are looking at opportunities in the Middle East, Eastern Europe and in the US to grow our portfolio.”

In Eastern Europe, Kalyon Enerji is considering Romania and Poland, while in the Middle East and North Africa, it is targeting markets including Algeria, Morocco and Libya, according to Mr Ata.

In the US, “there are many projects that have been offered to us and we are studying them”, he said, without disclosing details.

Globally, countries are boosting investments in renewable projects as they look to cut emissions to meet their clean energy goals. The US aims to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, while other countries have set their own targets to cut emissions to reduce global warming.

Kalyon Enerji’s portfolio includes a 1.3-gigawatt solar power plant in Turkey, which is the “largest in Europe and has received the largest green financing from UKEF [UK Export Finance]”, Mr Ata said. Its other projects are also based in Turkey.

The Istanbul-based company has “all the capacity and capability to execute projects on its own”, Mustafa Kocar, chief executive of Kalyon Holding, said.

“Currently, we are the biggest renewable investor in Turkey. So basically, we have the technical expertise, we have the capacity to inject more equity in new projects and we can secure the financing through our own resources,” he added.

“We have very good relations with the international financing network.”

New power plants in Syria

Kalyon Enerji is building new power plants in Syria after economic sanctions were lifted on the country by the US and the EU last month.

On Thursday, it signed a $7 billion energy investment agreement with a consortium of companies including Qatar's UCC Holding as well as US company Power international and Cengiz Enerji of Turkey to build a solar power plant with a capacity of 1,000 megawatts and natural gas power plants with a combined capacity of 4,000 megawatts in the country.

“The target is to complete natural gas power plants in three years after financial closure, which maybe four years from today. For solar one and a half year after financial closure, which is two and a half years from today,” said Mr Ata.

After 14 years of war, Syria's electricity sector has been suffering from severe damage to its grid and power stations, ageing infrastructure, and persistent fuel shortages, generating only 1.6 gigawatts of electricity, down from 9.5 gigawatts before 2011, according to a Reuters report.

Reconstructing the country's power sector is expected to cost about $11 billion and the new administration is betting on the private sector shouldering the burden, underlining a shift from the state-led economic policies of the former regime led by Bashar Al Assad.

“We are really happy to contribute to the development of Syria after the new situation,” Mr Ata said.

Global expansion in construction

Meanwhi, Kalyon Holding is also eyeing opportunities in other verticals of its business including in construction, according to Mr Kocar.

“We were more [of] a local company, but in the last couple of years, with this strategy of internationalisation, on the construction side, we are undertaking some works in Azerbaijan in rail and highway,” he said.

“We are also doing a gas pipeline project for Romania’ state-owned Transgaz and are bidding for many tenders on the construction side in the Middle East, CIS [Commonwealth of Independent States], North Africa and Eastern Europe.”

Kalyon Holding is also eyeing opportunities in airport construction in Turkey and other parts of the Middle East after building Istanbul airport in 2019.

“We have a 55 per cent stake in Istanbul airport, and we have completed its construction, and we are now managing the airport together with our partner there,” Mr Kocar said.

This article is part of: Centre for Nature and Climate

Much of the public discourse around AI centres around cybersecurity and such issues, but its environmental impact also needs to be considered.

While AI and the data centres it relies on use large amounts of energy and water, the technology can also be used to help tackle climate change.

By adopting practical strategies, there are actionable steps that organizations can take to align their AI strategies and sustainability goals.

Conversations around the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in business typically centre around data security, ethical uses and the risk of over-reliance on the emerging technology. But there is also growing discussion and concern around AI’s environmental footprint and rightly so.

With AI having a significant impact on energy and water consumption, as well as global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, it is vital that the subject of environmental sustainability is included in discussions around responsible AI.

Simultaneously, there’s an undeniable sense of renewed hope that AI can positively contribute to the global transition to a lower carbon economy. As AI’s impact rises alongside growing use of the technology, we must reflect on how it contributes to – and fights against – climate change.

AI’s growing appetite for energy and water

Over the past decade, demand for cloud computing and digital services has focused minds on energy optimization, with modern data centres increasingly adopting energy-efficient hardware and advance cooling systems leading to improved power usage effective averages across the industry. However, the reality is that the energy demands of AI, powered by data centres, significantly outpace current efficiency gains.

A single ChatGPT inquiry consumes about five times more electricity than that of a web search, while it is also estimated that training a single language model such as GPT-3 uses electricity equivalent to the power consumed annually by 130 US homes.

Then, there’s the energy consumption of AI image generation. While an AI model generating text in response to 1,000 prompts requires as much 16% of a full smartphone charge, generating an image requires the equivalent of 100%.

AI operations also come with high water demands as data centres require cooling systems to maintain optimal operating temperatures. GPT-3 is estimated to utilize about one 16-ounce bottle of water for every 10-50 responses it prepares and this quickly adds up when factoring in billions of queries – with AI’s projected annual water withdrawal to reach 6.6 billion cubic metres by 2027.

Lastly, operational logistics, including construction and maintenance, account for up to two-thirds of a data centre's lifetime emissions. Emissions from building infrastructure, manufacturing IT equipment and chip manufacturing requirements of data centres contribute significantly to AI’s environmental footprint.

As AI workloads expand, so do their power demands. The World Bank estimates that AI’s wider industry category of information and communications technology currently generates at least 1.7% of global emissions. While this percentage may seem modest, current figures only reflect today’s reported AI usage and not tomorrow’s actual consumption.

AI adoption continues to accelerate – and also considering increased global digital penetration, expansion of cloud storage, internet of things uptake and the growing prevalence of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies – the collective impact on climate change could become significantly larger, even as environmental efficiencies are factored in.

Under current growth trajectories, the International Energy Agency (IEA) predicts global data centres may consume up to 1,000 TWh of electricity in 2026 – an increase of 400% from 2022.

Meanwhile, reports from major tech giants support these projections with Google and Microsoft recently disclosing year-on-year increases in emissions, warning these trends challenge their climate commitments. That said, many businesses are still innovating new ways to respond to the impacts of their energy use.

Mitigating the impact of AI energy consumption

Many prominent organizations associated with cloud computing and AI development have taken strong stances on tackling emissions and climate. For example:

Amazon has matched 100% of its operation’s global energy consumption with electricity generated by renewable energy systems.

Microsoft established a supplier code of conduct, requiring suppliers to transition to 100% carbon free electricity by 2030, and has committed to doing the same.

Google remains committed to their goal to rely on carbon-free electricity by 2030 and have launched efforts to improve their AI model efficiency and data-centre energy consumption.

OpenAI founder Sam Altman invested $20 million in Exowatt, which uses solar power to help meet the needs of OpenAI data centres.

Salesforce announced that it is lobbying for new regulations to compel companies to report AI emissions data and efficiency standards as part of its Sustainable AI Policy Priorities initiative.

Amid continued investment in computing infrastructure and AI development, looking to industry leaders can provide inspiration for improving energy management and reducing emissions.

Reducing AI energy consumption

As we consider the need to address the environmental impact of AI use as part of global efforts to build a sustainable future, organizations of all sizes can pull their weight in the following ways:

1. Measure emissions and reduction efforts

Leverage tools to measure, analyse and report your emissions over time

Work with suppliers to know how your AI use translates to energy consumption

2. Use efficient AI models and optimize AI workflows

Leverage pre-trained models and APIs

Compress models or use batch processing wherever possible

3. Comply with ISO 42001 requirements

When determining which ISO 42001 standards affect your organization’s AI management system, include climate change as a relevant factor

Conduct an AI system impact assessment, which evaluates societal impacts of your AI system, including the effects on environmental sustainability

4. Partner with sustainable vendors

Utilize AI and cloud platforms committed to renewable or carbon-free energy and that publish sustainability metrics and goals

Seek vendors who are ISO 14001 and ISO 42001 certified, which demonstrates their commitment to improving sustainability performance and using ethical AI systems

5. Foster a company-wide sustainability culture

Educate and train employees on emissions, energy demands and water use related to business and AI operations

Source ideas for sustainability-related efforts from employees and create an environmental sustainability employee resource group to lead the implementation of such measures

Engage with customers and suppliers to collaborate on ways to mitigate energy use and emissions

AI’s positive environmental impact

Amid the public discourse around AI and its undeniable environmental impact, many argue that it can also be a powerful tool in the fight against climate change – and they’re right.

AI can quickly and effectively analyse significant volumes of data to provide insights into climate trends and the effectiveness of emissions reduction strategies that can lead to faster action. Additional capabilities for AI to positively contribute to fighting climate change include:

Providing greater understanding of extreme weather climate risks

Modelling climate scenarios

Improving resource utilization and management

Expediting the development of new sustainable, energy-efficient materials

Reducing carbon footprints by forecasting demands and optimizing operations

Developing product life-cycle assessments to improve the accuracy of supply chain emissions calculations

Tackling AI-driven emissions

Maintaining awareness of the sustainability expectations of investors, suppliers and consumers, and tracking and reporting energy use and emissions, is best practice for organizations wanting to tackle AI-driven emissions.

Publishing an annual emissions inventory that is subject to third-party assurance or by becoming ISO 14001 certified, gives stakeholders confidence that you are committed to sustainability, while ISO 42001 certification also demonstrates a commitment to using ethical, trustworthy and accountable AI systems. It’s also vital to ensure you keep up with and emerging sustainability and AI regulations as they evolve.

What's the World Economic Forum doing about the transition to clean energy?

Moving to clean energy is key to combating climate change, yet in the past five years, the energy transition has stagnated.

Energy consumption and production contribute to two-thirds of global emissions, and 81% of the global energy system is still based on fossil fuels, the same percentage as 30 years ago. Plus, improvements in the energy intensity of the global economy (the amount of energy used per unit of economic activity) are slowing. In 2018 energy intensity improved by 1.2%, the slowest rate since 2010.

Effective policies, private-sector action and public-private cooperation are needed to create a more inclusive, sustainable, affordable and secure global energy system.

Benchmarking progress is essential to a successful transition. The World Economic Forum’s Energy Transition Index, which ranks 115 economies on how well they balance energy security and access with environmental sustainability and affordability, shows that the biggest challenge facing energy transition is the lack of readiness among the world’s largest emitters, including US, China, India and Russia. The 10 countries that score the highest in terms of readiness account for only 2.6% of global annual emissions.

To future-proof the global energy system, the Forum’s Centre for Energy & Materials is working on initiatives including Clean Power and Electrification, Energy and Industry Transition Intelligence, Industrial Ecosystems Transformation, and Transition Enablers to encourage and enable innovative energy investments, technologies and solutions.

Additionally, the Mission Possible Partnership (MPP) is working to assemble public and private partners to further the industry transition to set heavy industry and mobility sectors on the pathway towards net-zero emissions. MPP is an initiative created by the World Economic Forum and the Energy Transitions Commission.

EnergySage, a solar energy consumer resource, simplifies the process of going solar.","Behind hydropower, nuclear energy is the second-largest source of low-carbon electricity in the world, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. The U.S. Energy Information Administration reported that as of August 2023, there were 93 operating nuclear reactors at 54 sites in 28 states.

Google is about to add three more to that list.

Through nuclear site developer Elementl Power, Google will fund the project and plans to add 600 megawatts of generating capacity at all three sites, as reported by TechCrunch.

While the development company has yet to develop any power plants, its experience and understanding of the nuclear power industry make Elementl well-suited for such an ambitious and beneficial project.

The project will rely on small modular reactors, which are nuclear reactors smaller than typical commercial ones in size and output. There are currently no SMRs outside of China, but developers in the United States are attracted to them for their cost-effectiveness, short construction times, and nonexistent carbon output.

This initiative by Google and Elementl will financially benefit consumers whose electricity is sourced from nuclear power. The World Nuclear Association said nuclear plants are expensive to build but cheap to run. Because of this, consumers pay less for nuclear energy than they do for energy sourced from polluting fossil fuels.

Free energy is a dream, but it is entirely possible. When consumers use nuclear power as well as solar panels, their energy bills can drop to near $0. EnergySage, a solar energy consumer resource, simplifies the process of going solar. The company compares quotes for consumers and can potentially save them up to $10,000.

Clean energy can be a money-saver, giving consumers more finances for other essentials. This collaboration between Google and Elementl will benefit the planet and the economy.

In a press release, Elementl Power Chairman and CEO Chris Colbert said: ""Innovative partnerships like this are necessary to mobilize the capital required to build new nuclear projects, which are critical to deliver safe, affordable and clean baseload power, and help companies advance their long-term net zero goals.""

Amanda Peterson Corio, the global head of data center energy at Google, said in the same release: ""Google is committed to catalyzing projects that strengthen the power grids where we operate, and advanced nuclear technology provides reliable, baseload, 24/7 energy.""

Trump's Republican administration is supporting the development of fossil fuels in contrast to his Democratic predecessor Joe Biden, who had massively supported the production of renewable aviation fuels through tax credits.
- 'Entirely achievable' - The air transportation industry has faced growing pressure to deal with its contribution to the climate crisis.
To achieve net-zero emissions, airlines rely on non-fossil sources known as Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).
""This represents only 0.7 percent of total aviation needs,"" IATA Director General Willie Walsh said.","The airline industry's flagship goal of decarbonising by 2050 is now ""in peril"" due to climate-sceptic policies, including those of US President Donald Trump, the leading airline association IATA warned on Sunday.

The emergence of leaders favouring fossil fuels and recent regulatory rollbacks are ""obviously a setback... it does imperil success on the 2050 horizon"", Marie Owens Thomsen, the International Air Transport Association's senior vice president for sustainability, told reporters.

""But I don't think it's going to halt or reverse progress. I think it will just slow progress,"" she said at the IATA annual industry conference in India.

Trump's Republican administration is supporting the development of fossil fuels in contrast to his Democratic predecessor Joe Biden, who had massively supported the production of renewable aviation fuels through tax credits.

UN aviation agency members, from the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), have set the year 2050 as their goal for achieving net-zero carbon emissions for air travel -- an industry often criticised for its outsized role in climate change.

- 'Entirely achievable' -

The air transportation industry has faced growing pressure to deal with its contribution to the climate crisis.

Currently responsible for 2.5 percent to three percent of global CO2 emissions, the sector's switch to renewable fuels is proving difficult, even if the aeronautics industry and energy companies have been seeking progress.

To achieve net-zero emissions, airlines rely on non-fossil sources known as Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

However, SAF biofuels are still three to four times more expensive than petroleum-based jet fuel.

""Another problem, which is related, is the fact that oil is so cheap,"" Owens Thomsen said. ""I think that also diminishes the sense of urgency that people have.""

A barrel of Brent North Sea crude, the international benchmark, stands below $65 as a result of Trump's tariffs, his call to ""drill baby drill"" and especially a decision by OPEC+ to hike crude output quotas.

This represents an immediate boon for airlines, whose fuel costs represent between a quarter and a third of operating expenses.

SAF is seen as a crucial ingredient in hitting emissions targets. The biofuel produces lower carbon emissions than traditional jet fuel and is made from plant and animal materials such as cooking oil and fat.

European Union rules require carriers to include two percent of SAF in their fuel mix starting this year, rising to six percent in 2030 before soaring to 70 percent from 2050.

Owens Thomsen estimated on Sunday that $4.7 trillion in investment is needed to establish SAF sectors capable of meeting the needs of air transport by 2050.

""It is entirely achievable,"" she said, adding that the raw materials and technology already exist and simply need to be developed.

""The money involved is very comparable to the money that was involved in creating the previous new energy markets, notably obviously wind and solar,"" she said.

That money could be found just by stopping subsidies to oil producers, she said.

""The world is subsidising large oil companies to the height of $1 trillion per year,"" she said.

""With that money, if it were redirected in its totality, we could solve our energy transition in less than five years.""

IATA also indicated on Sunday that it expects global SAF production to double this year compared with 2024 to 2.5 billion litres -- slightly down from its previous projections of 2.7 billion litres.

""This represents only 0.7 percent of total aviation needs,"" IATA Director General Willie Walsh said.

A lot of this renewed attention to nuclear power is focused on the rollout of small modular reactors, rather than traditional nuclear plants.","Europe is embracing nuclear energy with a new vigor. Even the most historically staunch nuclear opponents are softening their restrictions on the carbon-free form of energy production as the continent continues to pivot away from oil and gas imports and toward energy independence in the long shadow of Russia’s invasion in Ukraine and the European energy crisis that followed.

In March, the government of Italy made a significant step toward overturning the nation’s 40-year ban on nuclear power production. In April, leadership in Spain indicated that they would be open to reconsidering the phase-out of nuclear plants in that nation. And just this month, Denmark followed Italy’s lead in publicly announcing the legal revisitation of its nuclear ban, and Germany – Europe’s starkest nuclear energy adversary – agreed to drop its opposition to nuclear power in European Union legislation, in cooperation with France. A German official called the move “a sea-change policy shift” that will remove roadblocks and increase efficiency in energy policymaking within the European Union.

According to a report from CNBC, “The renewed European interest in nuclear shows how some countries are hedging their bets in pursuit of more energy independence.” However, it’s also related to the “hidden cost” of balancing and transporting electricity from renewables, the outlet reports.

While solar and wind remain much cheaper alternatives for power generation, their rapid expansion in European grids has not been without challenges. Last month, one of the worst blackouts in European history crippled power grids across Spain and Portugal, and many think that the rapid buildout of renewable resources in that region could be to blame. While official reports on the cause of the blackout are still in investigation stages, critics have been quick to point to the fact that around 70% of Spain's electricity production at the time of the blackout, and that Spain’s solar capacity growth has outpaced the rest of Europe by a factor of two.

Furthermore, the pivot toward renewable energy has caused some volatility in European energy markets, where prices have occasionally dropped below zero over the past year. While these price crashes are great news for European consumers, who have been battered by high utility bills in recent years, they’re bad news for the sector and the climate, as they can discourage further investment in renewable capacity expansion.

Despite these challenges, solar and wind remain critically important to Europe’s energy independence and for climate goals. But leadership is clearly looking for a stop-gap while renewable-charged grids get their sea legs. “Solar and wind are still the cheapest and fastest way to drive the green transition, and that remains our focus. But we also need to understand whether new nuclear technologies can play a supporting role,” Lars Aagaard, Denmark’s minister for climate, energy and utilities, was quoted by CNBC.

A lot of this renewed attention to nuclear power is focused on the rollout of small modular reactors, rather than traditional nuclear plants. This relatively nascent technology offers a lot of advantages for countries like Denmark and Italy who phased out their nuclear workforces, and thereby national nuclear expertise, years ago. Unlike full-scale nuclear power plants, which require years of design and planning, these small modules are built in a factory setting and assembled on-site with a relatively small crew, and require little oversight.

“We have no recent experience with nuclear power, and we lack the necessary knowledge regarding safety and waste management. That’s why we must begin a serious analysis — not to replace solar and wind, but to see whether new nuclear can complement our energy system in the future,” Aagaard said about Denmark’s aversion to traditional nuclear development.

The US agriculture industry is facing a tsunami of misfortune between trade wars, climate impacts, and a fresh round of colony collapse disorder that decimated the honeybee population last year. In one bright spot, new agrivoltaic projects demonstrate that solar energy, crops, and livestock can coexist on the same land, creating new opportunities for farmers to earn revenue while preserving the land from development into shopping malls, housing developments, fulfillment centers and the like.

Farming-Friendly Solar Power Plants

The science behind the agrivoltaic movement began to emerge in force during the first Trump administration, as researchers assembled evidence that some plants can thrive in between solar panels, despite the shade they cast — or, in some cases, because the shade provides a beneficial cooling environment (see more solar-plus-farming background here).

That’s a sharp contrast with earlier practices, in which solar arrays were typically mounted on beds of gravel or other l0w-maintenance ground cover to cut costs, damaging the soil below if not permanently destroying it. Under an agrivoltaic scenario, livestock grazing can keep excess vegetation in check while restoring nutrients to the soil.

Farmers are also beginning to introduce food crops into solar arrays, but pollinator habitats, marginal farmland restoration, and livestock grazing are more typical use cases here in the US.

A 10-Hive Apiary For A New Agrivoltaic Project

Agrivoltaic specialists have also emerged to provide solar developers with purpose-built designs, hardware, and ecological guidance aimed at optimizing solar generation and agricultureat the same site.

Urban Grid, an Independent Power Producer that specializes in agrivoltaic projects, demonstrates how solar developers can take advantage of the growing store of knowledge and resources supporting the solar-plus-farming movement. The Texas-based company already grazes lambs on its 65-megawatt Crystal Hill Solar project in Halifax County, Virginia, and it has just launched a 10-hive, 500,000-bee apiary at the edge of the site in partnership with the Virginia firm Siller Pollinator Company.

“Together, Urban Grid and Siller’s founding farmer Allison Wickham are launching a multi-year study of pollinator activity and plant diversity on solar land. The program includes vegetation monitoring, soil sampling and honey analysis to understand how pollinators interact with the solar environment—and what that means for the surrounding ecosystem,” Urban Grid explains.

The new apiary is no small potatoes. Urban Grid expects the hives to produce more than 400 pounds of honey per year. In addition to providing samples for research, the company plans to share the honey among community food banks, schools, and faith organizations.

Next Steps For Agrivoltaic Research In The USA

The Trump-Musk budget chopper took a hard swing at the research branch of the US Department of Agriculture earlier this year, including the division that monitors colony collapse disorder. CCD is a catch-all for various conditions, whether environmental or human-made, that prompt worker bees to abandon their hives.

In normal times, USDA labs would be humming with activity as researchers race to find the causes and help restore bee populations. No such luck this year, which makes private sector agrivoltaic research projects like Crystal Hill all the more valuable.

“We’re not just placing hives on a solar site—we’re farming this land,” Allison Wickham emphasized in a press statement. “We’ll be analyzing pollen to identify what species bees are foraging, measuring vegetation changes over time and comparing site conditions near and far from the hives.”

“This kind of research can help shape smarter, more sustainable solar land use across the country and provide greater opportunities to a wider range of farmers and land managers,” Wckham added.

Here Come The Food Crops

In tandem with the new apiary, Wickham has been tasked with establishing a rotating crop operation on three acres of the Crystal Hill array, located near the hives. Urban Grid expects the pilot project to inform the expansion of its agrivoltaic plans from grazing and beekeeping to raise food crops, too. The company also plans to assess how its bee colonies benefit other nearby properties.

“This pilot gives us the chance to research pollinator impacts on the local community,”explains Urban Grid VP of Asset Management Jeff Hudson. “By installing the hives on the edge of the project we can study the impacts across a significant portion of the land, which allows us to measure pollination benefits for local farmland.”

“In the end, improving vegetation while producing energy is the goal—this is a business, and these innovations help us operate smarter while creating shared value for the communities we’re in,” Hudson added.

Next Steps For The US Agrivoltaic Industry

The loss of USDA research staff is not the only problem besetting the relationship between farmers and the federal government. In February, USDA summarily clawed back reimbursable renewable energy grants that had already been approved under the agency’s longstanding REAP (Rural Energy for America Program) branch, leaving some farmers on the hook for equipment and installation costs already incurred.

USDA later indicated that farmers could get reimbursed but they would need to align their grant descriptions with the priorities of the Trump administration, effectively boxing out agrivoltaic systems along with other renewable energy projects.

Meanwhile, private sector stakeholders like Urban Grid are picking up part of the slack. Urban Grid currently lists a 1-gigawatt (DC) portfolio of contracted or under construction solar projects, with 12 more gigawatts of solar in the pipeline and 7 gigawatts in co-located or standalone energy storage projects.

If all goes according to plan, research on beekeeping, grazing, and food crops at the Crystal Hill site will inform similar projects in the future. “These insights will shape habitat design, vegetation planning and ecological performance across the company’s portfolio, as Urban Grid works to expand this model,” the company explains.

Of interest from a political perspective, the company’s current focus of operations covers 12 states including 10 that voted for the winning presidential candidate on Election Day 2024: Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee, Alabama, South Carolina, Virginia, Indiana, and Pennsylvania. Maryland and Delaware are the other two states.

Meanwhile, keep an eye on Virginia’s growing footprint in the US lamb industry. In addition to Urban Grid’s Crystal Hill operation, the firm AEP is hosting sheep on its 485-megawatt Spotsylvania Energy Center in Virginia. As a further benefit, the sheep reportedly enjoy the cool shade cast by the solar panels on hot summer days.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/agrivoltaic-sheep-beekeeping-urban-grid.jpg,N,,2025-06-01 14:05:37.008863

Since his return to the Oval Office, Trump has positioned hydrocarbons as the backbone of the U.S. energy portfolio and also as a lever for exerting America’s geopolitical influence on the global stage. The focus on Washington’s utilization of natural resources as a geopolitical tool has centered around Europe, where the U.S. helped wean its transatlantic allies off their dependence on Russian gas. Trump’s push for Asian investment in the Alaska LNG project as a way to balance the region's trade with the U.S. amid the tariff disputes is a new test of U.S. energy diplomacy. Washington is seeking to leverage Asia’s growing demand for energy to compel renegotiations.

Is Alaskan LNG Moving Forward?

Once seen as a pipe dream hindered by challenges related to its scale, cost, and complexity, there is now renewed optimism regarding the $44 billion Alaska LNG project. The project, if built out, will move natural gas along an 800-mile pipeline from fields north of the Arctic circle to Southern Alaska and then be shipped on tankers to Asia, providing access to Alaska’s more than 120 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and the logistical benefit of avoiding the Panama Canal, reducing bottlenecks and drastically decreasing shipment times.

Following President Trump’s suggestion that trade partners can avoid tariffs by increasing their purchases of U.S. energy, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent confirmed that investments from Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan in the flagship LNG project could form the basis of a deal with those countries. If Trump’s reciprocal tariffs are implemented, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan would face 24%, 25%, and 32% tariffs, respectively.

Japan’s biggest electricity producer and gas buyer, Jera, is considering participating as part of its effort to negotiate a trade deal with the U.S., while officials from South Korea are expected to visit Alaska to discuss the project in the coming weeks. These developments follow announcements in March that Taiwanese state energy company CPC signed a nonbinding agreement with the state-run Alaska Gasline Development Group to buy U.S. LNG and invest in the project.

Asia’s Growing Energy Need

In addition to East Asia, U.S. tariff negotiations have brought several countries in Southeast and South Asia to the table, all of which are eager to purchase energy to reduce their trade surpluses with the U.S.

There’s a strong convergence of interests on all sides, especially from Asia. With electricity demand in Southeast Asia growing at an annual rate of 4% and a heavy reliance on maritime oil and gas imports through the Strait of Malacca, Indo-Pacific energy security stands to benefit greatly from increased trade with the U.S.

Since the onset of negotiations, several countries have started to explore the possibility of buying American energy. Bangladesh signed an agreement with Louisiana-based Argent LNG for up to five million tons per year, Indonesia has offered to buy $10 billion of additional U.S. energy goods, and Vietnam announced provisional deals for the import of U.S. energy projects to avoid tariffs. Some countries have taken measures aside from increasing their purchases of American energy products. For example, India is weighing the option to scrap its import tax on American LNG in addition to boosting U.S. oil imports, and Thailand pledged to buy more U.S. energy commodities and reduce import tariff rates on LNG and ethanol

With China’s suspension of U.S. LNG imports and Italian energy giant ENI’s CEO Cristian Signoretto’s cautionary comments on the competitiveness of American LNG as the U.S. imposes tariffs, Washington is angling to find new customers as it streamlines regulations, works to increase efficiency, and cut costs for natural gas export projects along the Gulf Coast.

How Energy Fits into the U.S Multilateral Approach to Asia

The Trump Administration’s attempt to corral Taiwan, Japan, and South Korea into making significant investments in the Alaska LNG project signals a continuation of its departure from the U.S.’s historical “hubs and spokes” alliance system in Asia.

In addition to bilateral contacts between the U.S. and its Asian partners, Washington is no longer limiting its collective engagement in Asia to defense and security. Asian countries recognize the increasing importance of regional energy security, and the U.S.’s energy-focused outreach is striking a chord. Trump’s use of energy in his carrot-and-stick approach reveals the mutual benefit of increased energy cooperation for all parties, given the region’s growing energy demand.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/67e3061c9282038b2b151a80/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-06-01 11:10:49.437175

The Toyota bZ goes on sale in second half of 2025.

The 2026 Toyota bZ makes a leap forward with improvements for everything from the subcompact EV's name to its charging system. The 2022 bZ4X was an uncharacteristic disappointment from the world’s largest automaker. Overpriced and under-equipped, it was hamstrung by everything from uncompetitive technology to a ludicrous name.

Toyota listened to its critics and turned one of the world’s most formidable continuous improvement machines loose.

Renamed the bZ ― still not poetry, but the badge no longer looks like a laser printer threw up ― the new model is competitive with small electric SUVs like the Kia Niro, Hyundai Kona and Fiat 500e.

The 2026 bZ goes on sale in the second half of 2025. Detailed figures for price, range and charging will be available later.

I recently drove a loaded bZ Limited through the exurbs surrounding Toyota’s North America headquarters in Plano. It felt like a completely different vehicle from the bZ4X Limited I tested a couple of months ago.

Key improvements to 2026 Toyota bZ

25% range increase to 314 miles

50% power increase to 338 horsepower

NSCS charging port

Plug & Charge compatibility

Radical makeover

Improvements to the ’26 bZ start at the EV’s heart: battery, charging and motors.

The bZ gets two sizes of lithium-ion battery: a 74.7 kWh unit delivers up to 314 miles range and a 57.7 kWh unit rated at 236 miles. The battery is now capable of pre-conditioning, which speeds up charging and reduces energy use in cold weather.

A built-in NACS charging port provides access to Tesla’s DC fast charging network. An adaptor will be necessary for CCS chargers common at other charging stations. An onboard charger upgraded from 7 to 11 kW will hasten charging at the 240v connections most EV owners use at home. Plug & Charge software makes charging fast and easy at participating chargers including Electrify America, EVgo, ChargePoint and Tesla.

Maximum power increases dramatically, from 214 to 338 hp for the AWD model and 201 to 221 hp for FWD.

The exterior styling benefits from updated front LED running lights and fascia that bring the nose into harmony with Toyota’s ""hammerhead"" nose. Body-color front fascia and cladding around the wheels is also new.

Driving impressions

The ’26 fairly leaps away from stops compared with its under-power predecessor. Toyota claims a 4.9-seconds 0-60 mph for the AWD bZ. It was mum on the previous model’s acceleration, and not out of modesty.

The steering was responsive in my time in neighborhoods, shopping districts and along wide, smooth roads that curved between corporate campuses and public parks.

The brakes are firm and easy to modulate. New steering column paddles adjust regenerative braking to recapture energy, but there’s no one-pedal setting to bring the bZ to a full stop.

The front seat is roomy, with a big center console that holds two new wireless charging pads. Wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are standard.

The new dash has a 14-inch touch screen. The instrument cluster is new, too, bigger and easier to read.

A heat pump reduces energy use for heating and cooling the cabin.

Standard heated steering wheel and front seats further reduce cold-weather energy use. Climate control options include ventilated front seats, heated rear seats and a radiant front-seat foot and leg heater.

Why buy a 2026 Toyota bZ?

Price and charging time are huge unknowns, but there’s lots to like about the 2026 Toyota bZ.

Its improved power and battery size give it competitive performance and range. Revised lights and exterior color pattern make it look like a grown-up vehicle, as opposed to the bZ4X’s cobbled-together appearance.

The interior of my bZ Limited was comfortable, trimmed in appealing soft materials and roomy.

It’s a huge step forward to Toyota’s EV status, worth a look from anybody shopping for a small electric SUV.

Posters celebrating cooperative principles decorated the walls; one, proclaiming “Democratic Member Control,” showed ants working together to carry a bright green fern leaf. Some of the electricians filtered in late, having come straight from a job site.

“We want to take a moment to recognize some amazing people in our co-op,” said Melanie Duggan, a senior project manager at Cal Solar, which installs rooftop solar and battery systems. Duggan and other managers then praised their colleagues’ “commitment to craft” and “pure fucking magic” — core values of the company. Workers cheered and clapped after each shout-out.

This supportive culture is at the heart of Cal Solar. “I haven’t run into any other construction environments where you have construction workers saying, ‘Love you,’” Lars Ortegren, the company’s co-founder and director of construction services, told me.

Cal Solar has been installing panels on homes and businesses in Grass Valley and surrounding Nevada County for the past 25 years. In 2019, it became a worker-owned cooperative, and Ortegren went from being sole owner to an employee-owner.

Today, Cal Solar’s worker-owners spend their days constructing solar systems and managing sales. But they also run a company. They make decisions, share profits and have a financial stake: $5,000 invested up front, or $1,000 down and $4,000 financed through paycheck withdrawals. Any employee may buy in, though currently only 46% are owners. Not everyone wants the additional responsibilities, Ortegren said, but all workers benefit from the cooperative culture.

“I haven’t run into any other construction environments where you have construction workers saying, ‘Love you.’”

Ortegren has wanted to create well-paying solar jobs and a collective workplace since he first entered the industry over two decades ago. “I had this whole fantasy of creating an anarchist labor union for solar installers,” he told me. Previously, Ortegren and Angel Niblock, Cal Solar’s general manager, were members of the Industrial Workers of the World. They believe in “the dignity of labor, in democratic workplaces and in the idea that those who do the work should have the say and a stake in how it’s done,” as Niblock put it at the company meeting.

In recent years, the solar industry has ballooned: It employs nearly six times more workers than the coal industry, according to a 2024 report from the Department of Energy. Solar jobs vary, though. Employees at rooftop solar companies like Cal Solar install panels in their own communities, while installers on large utility-scale projects travel between remote sites and rarely see their families, though they may earn more money. In California, for example, contractors often partner with labor unions and must pay prevailing wages on large projects. In states with weaker labor laws, however, some utility-scale facilities contract with temporary hiring agencies that have notoriously bad labor practices.

Meanwhile, Cal Solar’s worker-owners shape company policies and generate wealth for themselves and their colleagues.

A FEW HOURS before the company meeting, Alejandro de Necochea and his crew installed racking and wires on a home in Grass Valley. Panels leaned against the ranch-style house and power drills buzzed, echoing above the gentle ripple of a nearby stream.

“Every two or three days, I have a new job site that’s beautiful, just like this,” de Necochea said, gesturing toward the cedar, ponderosa and oak trees surrounding the property.

Solar first caught his interest over a decade ago, when he moved to Grass Valley to live with his parents in an off-grid home. That’s not unusual in Nevada County, which has attracted people interested in hippie, back-to-the-land lifestyles since the 1960s. De Necochea’s family relied on solar panels for electricity, so he learned the basics. Then, 10 years ago, he started working at Cal Solar. He’s now a lead journeyman electrician, worker-owner and board member with additional governance responsibilities.

De Necochea enjoys being a worker-owner, but “it’s not all sunshine and rainbows,” he said. “You definitely feel the pressure of it being your company.” For 10 hours a day, four days a week, he climbs on roofs and installs solar systems. But if there’s a board meeting in the evening, he doesn’t get to clock out when his shift ends. He could probably make more money on utility-scale projects, but he’s committed to Cal Solar.

“I had this whole fantasy of creating an anarchist labor union for solar installers.”

That commitment creates a sense of accountability: During the COVID-19 pandemic, for example, worker-owners took pay cuts to keep the business afloat. “You really feel like people got your back going through ups and downs,” he said.

Industry insiders call those ups and downs the “solarcoaster.” Companies must contend with shifting state and federal incentives, changing building codes, new technologies and global economic trends. “We’re at a low point right now on that solarcoaster,” Niblock told me.

Current challenges include the Trump administration’s tariffs, inflation, a potential rollback of a 30% federal tax credit for residential solar and reductions in California’s rooftop solar incentives. Right before California’s policy changed in April 2023, sales spiked. “We booked like a year’s worth of work,” said Casey Tomasi, Cal Solar’s design manager, “and then it immediately fell off a cliff.”

But Grass Valley homeowners still want solar, partly for independence from Pacific Gas and Electric. In recent years, PG&E has shut off power during periods of high wildfire risk, and Ryan Harris, who owns the home where de Necochea worked this spring, wanted a more reliable system. “Going without power for 14 days in the middle of winter or in the middle of a 115-degree heat storm in the summertime — it’s absolutely miserable,” he said. Now, his family will have electricity even when the grid shuts down.

THE CO-OP MODEL has helped Cal Solar and other residential solar companies stay resilient. “You have multiple sources of people working on these problems and solving them together, versus like one single owner sitting in his or her office trying to solve all this on their own,” said Stephen Irvin, co-founder and CEO of Amicus Solar Cooperative, a purchasing co-op that shares best practices and pools the collective buying power of small companies like Cal Solar to reduce equipment costs.

Today, 22 of Amicus’ 85 member companies have some form of employee ownership. Irvin himself was a co-founder of Namaste Solar, an early worker-owned solar company in Boulder, Colorado. Other employee-owned solar companies include Technicians for Sustainability in Tucson, Arizona, and Positive Energy Solar in northern New Mexico.

The collective brainstorming Irvin speaks of was visible at Cal Solar’s company meeting this spring. “What do you envision for the future of our co-op?” Niblock asked her co-workers.

“My biggest thing is staying lean right now and not growing too fast,” de Necochea replied.

“I’m interested in working for low- to mid-class people,” Ortegren said later. “I would love to not work for rich people anymore.” Ortegren sees himself and his co-workers not just as electricians but as educators, explaining how to use solar efficiently and effectively.

“As a co-op, it’s our vision,” Niblock said. “We have to have imagination. We have to be the creators of our own destinies.”

Europe’s largest power blackout in decades, still largely unexplained, has raised questions about whether renewable energy can be relied on to provide a stable source of clean energy. It has also fuelled a renewed interest in the global nuclear power renaissance already under way.

Despite long-held environmental concerns about nuclear power generation, political leaders across the globe are increasingly looking to lift restrictions on nuclear reactors or invest billions in new projects to keep pace with the fast-rising demand for low-carbon energy, which is expected to accelerate as AI datacentres grow.

In Spain, the blackout has intensified an ongoing debate over the government’s plans to phase out the country’s remaining seven nuclear reactors by 2035. Support for the low-carbon energy source has re-emerged hand-in-hand with criticism of renewable energy, and its potential role in the outage.

Spain’s power grid relied on renewable energy for about 70% of its power at the time of the blackout, which experts believe may have made it more difficult for the energy system operator to keep the grid’s frequency stable.

The suggestion was vehemently denied by Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, in the country’s parliament. Just hours after the blackout he said: “There was no problem caused by an excess of renewable energy. Those who link this incident to the lack of nuclear energy are either lying or revealing their ignorance.”

But even before the Iberian peninsula was plunged into chaos, critics of the government’s anti-nuclear stance had raised their concerns. A few weeks before the blackout, the chair of the renewable energy company Iberdrola, which owns a small stake in the country’s nuclear fleet, warned Spain against plans to shut all seven of its nuclear power plants by 2035.

Ignacio Galán predicted that Spain could see its electricity prices jump by a quarter and get a less reliable system if Madrid followed the example of Germany, which began to close its nuclear reactors following the Fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011 and completed the phase-out in 2023.

Days later Sama Bilbao y León, director-general of the World Nuclear Association, told a conference in Madrid that she was “concerned about Spain’s economic future without nuclear energy” because its economic progress would rely on “abundant, clean, and affordable energy, available every day, all year round”.

In Germany the hardline stance against nuclear power is already softening. Chancellor Friedrich Merz, who came to power in February, has criticised the previous government for shutting Germany’s last three nuclear power stations in the midst of Europe’s energy cost crisis and promised to explore whether it is possible to resurrect the plants.

Merz is not expected to back a return to new conventional nuclear power projects in Germany but he has vowed to invest in new technologies: such as small modular reactors (SMRs) and nuclear fusion. The Swiss government has also said it will lift the country’s ban on the construction of new nuclear power projects, which has been in place since 1 January 2018, to pursue SMR projects.

The tide against nuclear power is turning in countries beyond Europe too. In Australia the new coalition government wasted little time in lifting the country’s ban on nuclear generators with a promise to commit $36.4bn in equity for two projects that it says could be operating by the mid 2030s – and $118.2bn for the seven projects it has promised by 2050.

Later this summer Taiwan is expected to vote on whether to restart a nuclear reactor which shut just last week amid concerns on the island about the rising electricity demand of some of the world’s biggest chipmakers which are based there, and about energy security in the event of a military blockade by China.

The concerns about a looming surge in power demand driven by tech giants and the desire for secure, homegrown low-carbon energy sources are common in countries across the globe. This trend is key to the renewed interest in nuclear power.

In the US, the notorious Three Mile Island site in Pennsylvania will restart for the first time in five years after its owners struck a 20-year deal to power Microsoft’s energy-hungry AI datacentres. Tech companies including Amazon, Meta and Apple are all expected to consume vast amounts of energy to power the boom in AI, and nuclear has emerged as an increasingly popular option given its steady stream of 24/7 power generation.

US President Donald Trump, who has taken aim at the Biden administration’s support for renewable energy, this month unveiled a series of executive orders aimed at delivering 10 large nuclear reactors by 2030, and quadrupling the country’s nuclear energy capacity by 2050. The move was welcomed by nuclear proponents as a step towards helping to lower emissions in the US while supporting Big Tech.

“Several big tech companies looking for low carbon, round-the-clock energy signed contracts for new nuclear capacity in the last year, and there could be more such deals ahead,” predicted the US investment bank Goldman Sachs earlier this year.

“The proliferation of AI data centers has boosted investor confidence in future growth in electricity demand at the same time as big tech companies are looking for low-carbon reliable energy. This is leading to the de-mothballing of recently retired nuclear generators, as well as consideration for new larger-scale reactors,” it added.

The growing demand for electricity may have piqued the interest of global government in nuclear power, but it is the breakthrough in new nuclear technologies which promises a new dawn for the industry. Whereas full-scale nuclear projects are notorious for spiralling budgets and delays, SMRs promise quicker, cheaper construction because the component parts can be built in a factory and assembled on site. But the technology has not been proven commercially.

Last year Google became the first company to ink an agreement to purchase nuclear energy from small modular reactors (SMRs), which are being developed by Kairos Power in the US. Small modular reactors are also being pursued by the US, South Korea, China, Russia, and Canada. The latter approved the construction of the first mini-nuclear reactor in the West earlier this month which is expected to begin operating by 2029.

In the UK, Keir Starmer unveiled plans for a historic expansion in nuclear power across England and Wales shortly after calling for tech companies to work alongside the government to build small modular reactors (SMRs) to power energy intensive AI datacentres across Britain. He said that he anticipated smaller reactors could begin operating in 2032 and become commonplace across Britain.

The nuclear industry’s detractors have played down the potential for SMRs to prove a gamechanger for nuclear energy. Dr Doug Parr, the chief scientist and a director at Greenpeace UK, said the Labour government had “swallowed nuclear industry spin whole, which is courageous – or stupid – given that not a single one has been built, and with the nuclear industry’s record of being over time and over budget unmatched by any other sector.”",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/915e7e6a0aa77637bfde048486c43968640e9752/176_0_4520_3616/master/4520.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2318dbeb1db340eae8fa3d811aa4a876,N,,2025-06-01 11:10:03.514118

In a press release, Phil Roos, director of the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy, announced the introduction of 18 electric school buses and 20 chargers for Dearborn Public Schools. This marks a monumental step for the state in the fight against climate change caused by the pollution from planet-warming gases as part of Gov. Gretchen Whitmer's MI Healthy Climate Plan.

Rather than relying on diesel-powered buses to transport children to school, these electric buses don't emit tailpipe pollution, saving them from breathing in harmful fumes that can lead to significant health risks like asthma and other respiratory issues. The vehicles also save the school district money on fuel, freeing up funds that can go toward other classroom resources.

""In less than three years, we've helped districts across Michigan deploy nearly 400 electric school buses — including these right here in Dearborn,"" Roos said in the release. ""We're moving from diesel-dominated fleets to cleaner, quieter, and more sustainable transportation — and we're doing it faster than ever.""

The introduction of electric school buses was made possible by support from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Clean School Bus Program and Michigan's Clean Bus Energy Grant, which the release described as ""transformational."" It was also noted that partnerships across federal, state, and local levels facilitated this development, with support from the EPA and the Michigan Department of Education playing a key role.

""Electrifying school buses is more than a clean energy milestone,"" Roos said in the release. ""It's about protecting kids' health, investing in communities, and building a future where every child in Michigan can ride to school in a vehicle that's good for them and good for the planet.""

The decision, which affects major carbon capture and clean technology initiatives, comes as the Donald Trump administration re-evaluates publicly funded awards and loans aimed at emerging technologies.

“While the previous administration failed to conduct a thorough financial review before signing away billions of taxpayer dollars, the Trump administration is doing our due diligence to ensure we are utilizing taxpayer dollars to strengthen our national security, bolster affordable, reliable energy sources and advance projects that generate the highest possible return on investment,” U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright said.

Among the canceled projects is a $332 million carbon-cutting initiative at Exxon Mobil’s Baytown refinery complex in Texas, which aimed to reduce emissions by using hydrogen instead of natural gas to produce ethylene, a key component in plastics and textiles, Reuters news report said. Other major projects affected include a $500 million award to Heidelberg Materials in Louisiana and a $375 million award to Eastman Chemical Company in Longview, Texas.

Nearly 70 percent of the canceled awards had been signed between the November 5, 2024, election and January 20, 2025, Biden’s final day in office.

The move reflects the Trump administration’s shift in energy policy, which prioritizes maximizing oil and gas output while rolling back key aspects of Biden-era climate and clean energy policies. The administration has framed the decision as part of a broader effort to reassess government spending on emerging technologies.

Environmental groups and clean energy advocates have strongly criticized the cuts. Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, called the decision “short-sighted” and warned it could stifle innovation.

“Locking domestic plants into outdated technology is not a recipe for future competitiveness or bringing manufacturing jobs back to American communities,” Nadel said.

The Center for Climate and Energy Solutions estimated that the termination of the projects could result in the loss of up to 25,000 jobs and a $4.6 billion hit to economic output.

The affected companies, including Exxon Mobil, Heidelberg Materials, and Eastman Chemical, have not yet responded to requests for comment.

The canceled projects were part of the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations’ efforts to test carbon capture and storage technologies at industrial sites. Carbon capture projects aim to mitigate climate change by removing carbon dioxide from the air or from industrial emissions for long-term storage underground. In some cases, the captured CO₂ is injected into depleted oil fields to enhance crude production.

The cuts have fueled debate over the future of U.S. climate policy, as the country faces mounting pressure to reduce greenhouse gas emissions while maintaining energy security and industrial competitiveness.

Georgia Power attorneys say the company’s forecast continues to grow based on the state’s economic projections for commercial and industrial customers.
The staff is recommending Georgia Power decrease its load growth projections for data centers by as much as 25%.
However, the three days of hearings began with public comments expressing split reactions to Georgia Power and its energy plans.
Craig told commissioners that he felt the company’s energy plan provides the necessary infrastructure to continue providing reliable electricity to businesses.","The state’s largest electric utility says it needs to significantly increase its energy capacity to accommodate a potential wave of data centers.

Georgia Power plans to turn to some renewable energy to generate that electricity, but for the most part, the utility intends to lean on fossil fuel sources like gas-fired power plants to boost capacity.

Those controversial plans, packed into what’s called an integrated resource plan, received a public airing during three days of public hearings. Several clean energy advocacy groups and state regulator staffers urged members of the Georgia Public Service Commission to reject the plan.

Commissioners are set to vote on the proposal in July.

Data centers fuel growth forecasts

Georgia Power projects that over the next several years the growth of data centers will significantly increase the state’s electricity consumption, and the company is requesting to add about 9,000 megawatts of capacity by 2031. According to the utility’s forecasts, data centers will consume about 80% of the new power generated.

But some have questioned the accuracy of those projections.

PSC staff expert witnesses said this week they are concerned Georgia Power is using incorrect model forecasts. They also say the utility has not provided evidence showing that data centers are likely to materialize at a higher rate than other industries.

Georgia Power attorneys say the company’s forecast continues to grow based on the state’s economic projections for commercial and industrial customers.

PSC staff questioned the models used by the company that led to forecasting as much as 13,000 megawatts of peak load growth through 2044. The staff is recommending Georgia Power decrease its load growth projections for data centers by as much as 25%.

“Our recommendation is to adjust down Georgia Power’s load forecast,” said Robert Trokey, director of the Public Service Commission’s electric unit. “I think it’s important that they continue to file the data that they have been filing in quarterly reports. If we see trends continue over the short term as the projects roll out, then certainly Georgia Power should adjust its forecast methodologies.”

Advocacy groups have argued that overbuilding the infrastructure could shift the cost burden to ratepayers.

Public Service Commissioner Tricia Pridemore pushed back on the criticism, pointing to a recent rule change that requires data centers and other large companies consuming more than 100 megawatts of energy to cover their full electricity costs.

The change included a provision allowing Georgia Power to require companies to put up front-end collateral for energy costs over the lifetime of the contract. State regulators would also review any contract for high-energy users.

Clean energy versus fossil fuels

Georgia Power has come under fire for reversing plans to shutter a pair of coal plants, Bowen and Scherer. The company instead is asking that state regulators sign off on extending the life of the two plants and allow the company to ramp up its fossil fuel energy capacity.

The utility had planned to retire Bowen and Scherer by 2028. Since then, Georgia Power has cited the projected industrial growth boom primarily driven by massive data centers as a reason it is now planning to retire Bowen by 2035 and Scherer Unit 3 by 2038.

Energy experts and clean energy advocates expressed concerns about the company’s potential overestimation of electricity demand and the underestimation of gas-fired unit costs, which could lead to higher rates.

They recommended increasing planning flexibility, updating load forecasts, and exploring earlier deployment of renewables and energy storage. Their analysis compared different scenarios, showing that renewables and energy storage are more economical under various future conditions.

Critics of the plan advised the commission to require Georgia Power to present additional research portfolios and improve forecast accuracy. The company was also urged to further increase its investments in renewable energies like solar.

Energy consultant Maria Roumpani, who testified on behalf of the Georgia Conservation Voters, said that renewable energy and storage are much more economically viable than the expansion of gas-fired power plants.

“The analysis should focus on enabling earlier years of deployment for wind and energy storage, especially medium and low duration, as well as higher limits for solar,” she said.

Public, protestors weigh in

Clean energy and consumer advocates held a rally outside the PSC’s downtown offices while the hearing was underway Tuesday, warning of the potential consequences if the commission rubber-stamps Georgia Power’s long-term energy plans.

The five-member utility regulator is set to vote July 15.

Hundreds of written comments poured into the PSC, many of them dominated by concerns about rising utility bills and health risks tied to fossil fuels.

However, the three days of hearings began with public comments expressing split reactions to Georgia Power and its energy plans.

The long-term energy generation plan is receiving support from the Georgia Chamber of Commerce and local chamber officials such as Timothy Craig, director of business development of Valdosta-Lowndes County Chamber of Commerce.

Craig told commissioners that he felt the company’s energy plan provides the necessary infrastructure to continue providing reliable electricity to businesses.

“One of the first questions small business owners want to ask is: can I count on the systems that support my business?” Craig said this week. “Energy is at the top of that list. Whether it’s a local bakery or high tech firm, reliable energy is essential. Georgia Power’s plan delivers that reliability.”

Retired educator Bette Holland, founder of North Georgia Conservation Coalition, said it’s important that state regulators accept the science that shows that burning coal, oil and natural gas detrimentally increases the earth’s temperature.

“Solar and wind are much cheaper than fossil fuels to create energy,” Holland said. “The only thing that stops us are the energy companies and regulators who bow to the pressure of the fossil fuel companies. Please begin to think about the survival of the people in Georgia, in this country, on this planet, and about the survival of our natural resources in our wildlife.”",https://georgiarecorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_2696-2048x1365.jpeg,N,,2025-06-01 11:10:19.081140

However, Zeldin, a former member of Congress representing a district including eastern Long Island, has faced stiff criticism, beginning with his nomination, that has continued.

“Unqualified,” declared Ben Jealous, executive director of the Sierra Club, the nation’s largest environmental organization, upon the Zeldin nomination.

The League of Conservation Voters, in a letter to members of the Senate signed by its president, Gene Karpinski, called on it to reject the nomination. Cited was the organization’s “National Environmental Scorecard which details the voting records of members of Congress on environmental legislation,” on which “Zeldin’s abysmal 14% lifetime score …. [renders] him unqualified for the role.”

“Trump Picks New EPA Head Guaranteed to Destroy the Environment,” was the headline in The New Republic. The subhead on its article: “This will be a disaster.”

“Meet the ‘great deregulator’ Trump chose to lead EPA,” was the headline of the E&E website of Politico.

The headline of the New York Metropolitan Area news website Hell Gate said: “Lee Zeldin Appointed to Oversee Climate Collapse.” The subhead: “Trump choosing a Long Island lackey as EPA administrator.”

There were some hoorays for the nomination. “Congrats to Representative Zeldin on his nomination to be the 17th EPA administrator,” said Andrew Wheeler, an EPA administrator under Trump in his first term as president. Prior to that, he was a lobbyist for major coal, chemical and uranium companies.

And Elon Musk said of Zeldin’s nomination: “I know he will do a great job tackling the regulatory overreach while protecting our air and water.”

Zeldin has been a close ally of Trump. In 2021, he was among Republican members of the House who voted against certifying the results of the 2020 election, which Trump said he won. Also, Zeldin was a leader in defending Trump during Trump’s first impeachment hearings.

With Zeldin in office as EPA administrator, Sierra, the magazine of the Sierra Club, ran an article speaking of “axing programs and funding intended to address pollution and advance clean energy.”

“At the EPA, there has been an exodus of employees, a freeze on funding disbursement — including funds already authorized by Congress — as well as a dismissal of scientific advisory boards and a removal of climate change references from the agency’s website,” it reads.

In April, Zeldin, a Shirley resident, faced 100 protesters when he came to the Crest Hollow Country Club in Westbury to speak at an event hosted by the Long Island Association.

The demonstration was organized by Food & Water Watch and the Long Island Progressive Coalition. At it, Eric Weltman, New York senior organizer at Food & Water Watch, said “New Yorkers deserve an EPA that protects our health and environment, not one that does the bidding of corporate polluters.”

In May, there was sharp criticism of Zeldin after he announced the EPA was dropping federal limits on four “forever chemicals” in drinking water. The weakening of the rules is “a betrayal of public trust,” charged Adriene Esposito, executive director of Citizens Campaign for the Environment based in Farmingdale. It “adds a significant threat to public health,” she said.

Tagged “Empowering Future Leaders in Renewable Energy,” the NextGen RESCO programme is the first of its kind in Nigeria.
Aliyu explained that the programme responds directly to a critical labour shortage in Nigeria’s renewable energy sector.
“Currently, Nigeria has around 70,000 jobs in renewable energy, but with our population and energy needs, we should be producing five times that number,” he said.
He further noted that Africa, in general, accounts for only 320,000 renewable energy jobs, underscoring the urgency of building a sustainable workforce pipeline on the continent.","The Rural Electrification Agency (REA) has secured 130 paid energy jobs for young Nigerian graduates under its newly launched NextGen Renewable Energy Service Company (RESCO) programme. The initiative, which officially kicked off this month, aims to create a clear pathway from training to employment for aspiring professionals in the country’s fast-growing clean energy sector.

Tagged “Empowering Future Leaders in Renewable Energy,” the NextGen RESCO programme is the first of its kind in Nigeria. It is a collaborative effort between REA, the National Power Training Institute of Nigeria (NAPTIN), and the Eco-Innovation Empowerment Initiative. According to REA, the programme is designed to train, mentor, and place talented youth in paid internships and jobs across the country within a 12-month cycle. “We are not just training people, we are launching careers,” said REA’s Managing Director and CEO, Engr. Abba Aliyu, during the programme’s unveiling in Abuja.

Aliyu explained that the programme responds directly to a critical labour shortage in Nigeria’s renewable energy sector. “Currently, Nigeria has around 70,000 jobs in renewable energy, but with our population and energy needs, we should be producing five times that number,” he said. He further noted that Africa, in general, accounts for only 320,000 renewable energy jobs, underscoring the urgency of building a sustainable workforce pipeline on the continent.

Speaking to journalists, Aliyu said, “This programme is not only about creating 130 jobs. It is about building a national talent pipeline that will produce 10,000 energy professionals in the coming years. The gap between theory and hands-on skills is costing us, and we are here to close that gap.” According to him, the pilot programme last year placed 120 graduates across the six geopolitical zones and laid the foundation for the current expansion.

The NextGen RESCO initiative places greater emphasis on technical capacity than academic pedigree. “A degree is important, yes, but what this sector needs are people who can wire a solar mini-grid, calibrate inverters, and maintain battery systems,” Aliyu said. He added that the programme includes three months of classroom training, one month of internship with Renewable Energy Service Companies (RESCOs), and nine months of paid work placements.

Ahmed Nagode, Director-General of NAPTIN, echoed Aliyu’s sentiments. “Only 50 percent of the skilled workforce needed to sustain Nigeria’s power sector is currently available,” Nagode revealed. “Our graduates have knowledge, but many lack industry-grade technical skills. This programme is our answer to that crisis.” He also warned of the consequences of inaction, pointing to deteriorating solar infrastructure in the capital. “Streetlights powered by solar energy in Abuja may fail in the next five years if not maintained by skilled professionals,” he said.

A press release from REA further emphasized that the programme’s curriculum includes training in solar PV installation, mini-grid design, energy efficiency audits, and PV system supervision. “We are developing not just workers, but professionals who can innovate, manage systems, and lead projects,” the statement read. REA also confirmed that application is now open to qualified Nigerians nationwide.

Participants will benefit from paid internships and guaranteed jobs secured through partnerships with private RESCOs. According to REA, top-performing trainees will transition into nine-month, fully paid roles in the renewable energy sector. “These are not vague promises—these are signed agreements with our partners,” Aliyu stated.

By investing in skills and job placements, REA hopes to anchor Nigeria’s clean energy transition in local expertise. “We want to ensure that the people powering Nigeria’s energy future are young, homegrown talents who understand the terrain and the technology,” said Aliyu. With this initiative, the government aims not only to tackle unemployment but also to lay the groundwork for a sustainable, resilient energy system.",https://i0.wp.com/thenigeriaeducationnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/1000157294-1.jpg?fit=2880%2C1620&ssl=1,N,,2025-06-01 12:14:40.788731

As part of the first-half stage of development, Toyota has been refining the durability of liquid hydrogen pumps as well as technologies such as oval tanks that extend cruising range.

In last year’s Fuji 24 Hours Race, while Toyota’s team met its goal of running 30 consecutive laps on a single hydrogen refill, issues with the electrical system forced repeated pit stops, preventing the car from running for a sufficient amount of time.

The goal for this year’s race is to run for the entire 24 hours with a more reliable vehicle and liquid hydrogen system and to utilize the data obtained for future development, with the goal of making ever-better motorsports-bred cars.

Toyota will evaluate various types of low-carbon gasoline (E20) in the Super Taikyu Series and provide feedback from a technical perspective to build a knowledge base for supplying low-carbon gasoline with a maximum bioethanol concentration of 20%.

Further evolution of the liquid hydrogen-powered GR Corolla. As the culmination of the first-half stage of the liquid hydrogen-powered GR Corolla, Toyota has made the following technical improvements for this race based on the results of last year’s race.

Taking on the challenge of utilizing a hydrogen engine combustion switching technology that balances high output and fuel efficiency. Starting with this race, Toyota will take on the challenge of utilizing technology that automatically switches between stoichiometric combustion, which delivers high output, and lean combustion, which enables fuel-efficient driving, in response to the driver’s output requirements (accelerator operation).

Until now, Toyota has continued to improve stoichiometric combustion to achieve high output equivalent to that of gasoline.

From this race onwards, Toyota will take on the challenge of utilizing technology that smoothly switches to lean combustion when high output is not required with a view to applying it to the development of future production vehicles.

Developing a new filling valve that improves hydrogen filling speed and safety while making the vehicle compact and lightweight. Toyota has adopted a new structure for the filling valve used during hydrogen supply.

To date, valve opening and closing have been operated by an external actuator. However, in addition to limitations in expanding the flow path area during hydrogen supply, there have been challenges with improving airtightness in a -253 °C environment.

For this race, adopting a new internal piston structure has enabled an increase in flow path area, improving filling speed by approximately 30%. The new structure also eliminates the need for an external actuator, reducing weight by 2 kg. Furthermore, eliminating external opening and closing processes has improved airtightness and reduced the risk of hydrogen leakage.

Reducing vehicle weight through partial use of aluminum wiring for wire harnesses. A portion of the wire harnesses―bundles of wires distributed throughout the vehicle for power supply and signal transmission―has been changed from copper to aluminum wiring. Until now, corrosion caused by water exposure at terminal connections and other areas has posed a challenge in using aluminum wiring for wire harnesses.

For this race, adopting a sealed-structure terminal (Alpha terminal) using fiber laser welding technology developed by Furukawa Electric Co., Ltd. has made it possible to prevent water infiltration without compromising mass-producibility and cost competitiveness, thereby preventing corrosion, which had been an issue.

This change has also resulted in an 18% weight reduction compared to conventional wire harnesses.",https://bioage.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4fbe53ef02e8610271e4200d-600wi,N,,2025-06-01 12:14:57.657548

“From satellite skies to solar campuses, and from mechanized farms to biotech labs—Nigeria is rising, and it is powered by innovation.”","By Ikechukwu Emmanuel

Chief Uche Geoffrey Nnaji, Minister of Innovation, Science and Technology, has applauded President Bola Ahmed Tinubu, for steering Nigeria into a new era of science-driven, innovation-led development within the past two years.

In a statement signed by his Senior Special Adviser (Administration), Dr. Robert Ngwu, the Minister described the Tinubu administration as a “powerhouse of progress,” citing milestone achievements across clean energy, digital innovation, healthcare, security, agriculture, and job creation.

One of the administration’s flagship initiatives is the Renewed Hope Solarisation Project—a first-of-its-kind energy gift to Nigeria’s tertiary institutions and federal teaching hospitals. Under this initiative, each of the 36 states and the FCT will receive a 2MW solar hybrid power system, targeting one federal university and one federal teaching hospital per state.

“This pilot phase offers eco-friendly, reliable electricity to institutions long burdened by erratic power and rising utility costs,” Nnaji stated. “It is a beacon of hope and a foundation for national rollout.”

The Ministry is also advancing the Sustainable Energy Access Project (SEAP)—a nationwide clean energy and clean cooking initiative covering all 774 local governments. Full-scale implementation is projected to create nearly one million jobs, with a strong focus on youth, women, and artisans—echoing the Renewed Hope Agenda’s commitment to inclusive development.

In the domain of space technology, President Tinubu approved the launch of four new satellites—NigeriaSat-3, Sat-4, Sat-5, and NigeriaSAR-1—under the National Space Research and Development Agency (NASRDA). These assets will bolster national security, disaster response, border surveillance, agriculture, and geospatial land administration.

Another milestone is the formulation and national validation of Nigeria’s first Cleantech Innovation Policy, developed through the National Cleantech Innovation Programme (NCIP) with support from international partners. The policy aims to fast-track Nigeria’s green industrial revolution, climate resilience, and economic diversification. Its full implementation is expected to generate over 500,000 direct and indirect jobs in sectors such as agritech, renewable energy, circular economy, green transportation, and smart manufacturing.

Special emphasis is placed on empowering women, youth, and persons with disabilities, through inclusive funding, training platforms, and national mentorship schemes.

To reduce Nigeria’s overreliance on raw material exports and curb the costly dependence on imported finished goods, the Federal Ministry of Innovation, Science and Technology, through RMRDC, has proposed the 30% Minimum Value-Addition Bill. This pioneering legislation mandates that at least 30% of local value must be added to raw materials before they are exported or utilized in industrial production.

In a predominantly import-driven economy, the bill is a strategic policy shift designed to stimulate domestic manufacturing, enhance export earnings through value-added goods, and create widespread employment across key sectors such as agro-processing, extractives, and light industry. It also seeks to strengthen supply chain resilience, foster SME growth, and reduce vulnerability to global market shocks. By anchoring industrial progress on local capacity and innovation, the bill aligns with President Tinubu’s Renewed Hope Agenda and reinforces Nigeria’s path to economic self-reliance and competitiveness.

As part of the Ministry’s industrialization strategy, the revival and optimization of the cassava value chain has become a strategic national priority. Leveraging Nigeria’s comparative advantage as one of the world’s largest producers of cassava, the Ministry is facilitating the deployment of mechanized and semi-automated processing systems to enhance value addition, reduce post-harvest losses, and create high-impact jobs across rural communities.

A central component of this initiative is the extraction and industrial utilization of high-grade starch from cassava (HGCS), which serves as a versatile industrial raw material with a wide array of downstream applications spanning multiple sectors like food and beverage (Glucose syrup, sweeteners, baking ingredients, modified starch), pharmaceuticals and nutraceuticals (Tablet binding, dietary supplements and excipients, medical-grade glucose and dextrose), industrial and chemical manufacturing (Adhesives and glues, Biodegradable plastics and packaging materials, Paper sizing and coating agents, Textile finishing agents, Ethanol and industrial alcohol production), cosmetics and personal care (Starch-based baby powders, Organic thickeners and skin-conditioning agents), and agriculture and animal feed (Livestock feed concentrates, Binders in fish and poultry feed, Biofertilizer components).

By fostering the development of these value chain products, the Ministry is unlocking significant opportunities for import substitution, export diversification, and rural industrialization. This intervention aligns strongly with President Tinubu’s Renewed Hope Agenda and is poised to transform cassava from a subsistence crop into a strategic industrial commodity driving national prosperity.

Similarly, a €7.9 billion Green and Blue Methanol Industrial Complex is in the works to deliver decarbonization in blue economy, and low-carbon fuels, reinforcing Nigeria’s leadership in Africa’s clean energy transition.

In line with the clarion call of President Tinubu, GCFRlllllll, the Ministry has made a significant push toward research commercialization, with industrial-scale fabrication of agro-processing equipment—crushers, mixers, dryers, stoves, ovens—aimed at improving food security and reducing post-harvest losses. These machines are now being deployed in semi-automated production lines for palm oil, cassava, plantain, soybean, vegetable oil, etc.

One of the country’s most notable health breakthroughs is the development and field-testing of Nigeria’s first Artemisinin Extraction Plant, which extracts the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) from domesticated Artemisia annua—a game-changing innovation in the fight against malaria.

The National Research and Innovation Fund (NRIF), which is currently being finalized will empower scientists to commercialize their findings, with a pipeline of over 1000 patents expected annually. These outcomes position Nigeria as a knowledge economy anchored on innovation, not just consumption.

President Tinubu also established an Inter-Ministerial Innovation Committee, chaired by the Vice President, to align innovation and job creation targets across all MDAs. With support from the Nigeria Bureau of Statistics Nigeria now tracks metrics such as job creation, emissions reduction, and gender participation using real-time dashboards.

Under Tinubu’s strategic foreign policy, the Ministry has secured new partnerships with UNDP, UNESCO, the Commonwealth Secretariat, and the African Development Bank, boosting investment flows into Nigeria’s innovation ecosystem.

Speaking at a program organized by the Nepali Congress’ Department of Environment and Climate Change Affairs in Sanepa on Sunday to mark World Environment Day, Deuba warned of grave threats posed by climate change and pledged to take initiative in forging a common position among all political parties.

“As the president of a major party, I am ready to bring all parties together on a common platform for dialogue, coordination, and collaboration to address climate-related challenges,” Deuba said.

He noted that the confirmation of 2024 as the hottest year on record underscores the deepening climate crisis. “The world must act swiftly to drastically reduce carbon emissions. Delay is no longer an option,” he added.

Deuba criticized the global imbalance where highly polluting nations continue to emit greenhouse gases while vulnerable countries like Nepal disproportionately suffer the consequences. He stressed the importance of Nepal advocating strongly and consistently for climate justice on the global stage.

Green industrial hub

The green hydrogen plant—under development since 2023—is a flagship project for NGHC and a key pillar in NEOM’s strategy to create a carbon-neutral, circular economy.

With Oxagon as the host location, the partnership ensures direct alignment with NEOM’s ambition to be a global centre for advanced and sustainable industry.

NGHC’s facility is being constructed using cutting-edge technologies to deliver clean hydrogen at scale, aiming to set global benchmarks for both cost and efficiency.

Its strategic position on the Red Sea not only enables streamlined logistics through NEOM’s port but also enhances the potential for hydrogen exports to international markets.

End-to-end industrial support

Oxagon has played a vital role in advancing the NGHC project by offering a comprehensive suite of support services.

These include dedicated investor services, purpose-built infrastructure, and advanced cargo and logistics handling through the Port of NEOM—a next-generation gateway that combines smart logistics solutions with sustainability.

In addition, Oxagon has developed a tailored living environment for NGHC employees.

NGHC’s presence is expected to act as a catalyst, attracting complementary industries and reinforcing Oxagon’s position as a hub for sustainable manufacturing and future technologies.

With the backing of both Oxagon and NEOM, NGHC is well-positioned to become a global model for scalable clean energy production and export.

The majority opinion, written by Justice Brett Kavanaugh, said courts should strive for “clarity and predictability” where possible in deciding cases that involve the nation’s economy, but “the central principle of judicial review in NEPA cases is deference.”

Justice Kavanaugh wrote, “Courts should review an agency’s [environmental impact statement] to check that it addresses the environmental effects of the project at hand,” the opinion states. “The [statement] need not address the effects of separate projects. In conducting that review, courts should afford substantial deference to the agency as to the scope and contents of the [statement].”

“The legislation would ensure that Massachusetts stays on track to reduce emissions from transportation – the sector that accounts for the greatest share of emissions in the Commonwealth,” according to a bill summary.
Last week, conspiracy theorist Alex Jones posted about the bill on X, which was subsequently removed from the social media platform.
“I do worry about an unintended and subtle bias against rural Massachusetts,” Barrett said at the hearing on the bill.
Massachusetts’ clean energy and climate plan lacks “clear, measurable guidelines or targets” to reduce miles driven, Gadbois said at the legislative hearing.","A bill pending on Beacon Hill that looks to set a statewide vehicle miles traveled reduction goal as part of the decarbonization push has ignited national backlash, with critics calling it governmental overreach.

Under the so-called Freedom to Move Act, an interagency coordinating council would be tasked with crafting a “whole-of-government plan” to reduce reliance on personal vehicles and increase access to public transportation in the Bay State.

“The legislation would ensure that Massachusetts stays on track to reduce emissions from transportation – the sector that accounts for the greatest share of emissions in the Commonwealth,” according to a bill summary.

Senate Majority Leader Cindy Creem, a Newton Democrat, is leading the push to shift the Bay State away from relying “too heavily” on electric vehicles as a “decarbonizing strategy.”

“With the Trump administration rolling back vehicle emission standards and withholding funds from EV charging programs,” Creem said during a legislative hearing in mid-May, “and with congressional Republicans looking to repeal EV tax credits and derail state-level EV rules, now is the time to pursue new strategies, additional strategies.”

“Setting specific goals for reducing vehicle miles traveled would help guide decisions made across state government,” she added, “and sharpen the focus of efforts to promote alternative modes of transportation like public transit, biking, walking.”

A clip of Creem’s tesimony has gone viral in the weeks following the Joint Committee on Telecommunications, Utilities and Energy’s hearing on May 14.

Last week, conspiracy theorist Alex Jones posted about the bill on X, which was subsequently removed from the social media platform. Fox News’ ‘The Faulkner Focus’ also featured it in a segment titled “Democrats divided over how to move forward,” last Tuesday.

In the segment, anchor Harris Faulkner interviewed conservative political commentator Michael Knowles, who noted a survey that MassInc conducted last year showing that 70% of respondents “felt unsafe on public transit in the Greater Boston area.”

“People want to be safe,” Knowles said. “You need to give people some kind of option to vote for you. As Democrats are struggling with being viewed as so out of touch, I don’t think this lady in Massachusetts is going to help.”

State Rep. Mike Connolly, a Cambridge Democrat, is one of the bill’s eight co-sponsors. He told the Herald on Saturday that he believes the way the bill is being portrayed is “completely overblown and ignorant.”

“This legislation doesn’t attempt to set some specific limit or establish any kind of prescriptive formula to punish individual drivers, as the right-wing reporting on this seemed to imply,” Connolly said. “All it really does is say that we should put the structures in place to consider and refine our policies around vehicle miles traveled.”

The bill’s summary states that MassDOT’s transportation plans must “provide a reasonable pathway to compliance with our emissions limits for the transportation sector.” If those reductions aren’t met, the agency would have to make a “greater investment in public transit, bike and pedestrian infrastructure, or other clean transportation options.”

Regional planning organizations and MassDOT would also be required to approve only projects with “a reasonable pathway to compliance with the greenhouse gas emissions sublimits … and the statewide vehicle miles traveled reduction goals.”

Massachusetts Fiscal Alliance, a watchdog group, thrust the bill into the national spotlight, with a May 23 post garnering nearly 350,000 views on X and being multiplied further by prominent conservative accounts.

Organization spokesman Paul Diego Craney says the legislation would be “incredibly damaging to the state economy and restrict transportation for countless residents.”

“Massachusetts lawmakers need to reverse course on the state’s mandate to hit net-zero by 2050,” Craney told the Herald on Saturday, “which is driving these lawmakers to propose some extreme pieces of legislation … Net-zero is nothing more than a fantasy.”

The interagency coordinating council would be created through the legislation, consisting of 15 state officials.

The group would assess and report on strategies “necessary to reduce statewide vehicles miles traveled through the establishment of an equitable, interconnected, accessible and reliable network of non-personal vehicle transportation options and through land use policies that reduce the need for personal vehicles,” according to the bill.

Sen. Michael Barrett, a Lexington Democrat who chairs the Joint Committee on Telecommunications, Utilities and Energy, has raised concerns that the bill may not be practical in all parts of the Commonwealth.

“I do worry about an unintended and subtle bias against rural Massachusetts,” Barrett said at the hearing on the bill. He added it raises the “question of what someone is to do in a place where one has to travel a long distance” to work.

A statewide coalition of environmental organizations reported last December that transportation represents “37% of total emissions statewide, and it is one of the sectors where we have made the least progress toward our statutory Clean Energy and Climate Plan goals.”

One of the targets in that plan is for there to be “200,000 zero-emission vehicles on the road by 2025,” but the Bay State was “below half that total” at end of last year, according to the coalition.

State data shows that “light-duty vehicles” traveled 57,191 million miles in 2023, a figure projected to grow to “about 59,100 million in 2030.”

Seth Gadbois, a clean transportation staff attorney at the Conservation Law Foundation, highlighted that the bill is based on laws in Minnesota and Colorado, which redirected funding away from highway projects towards bus corridors.

Massachusetts’ clean energy and climate plan lacks “clear, measurable guidelines or targets” to reduce miles driven, Gadbois said at the legislative hearing.

“This absence leads to disparate and uncoordinated efforts to give people more options for how to get around,” he said, “all while miles driven by car and emissions continue to increase year over year.”

New Bedford resident Elijah DeSousa, founder of the energy advocacy group Citizens Against Eversource, told the Herald on Saturday that he believes the bill is not “just another climate proposal,” but a “blueprint for behavioral control disguised as environmental policy.”

“I refuse to quietly surrender the most fundamental right we have as citizens: the right to move freely, without needing permission from unelected councils or state-issued metrics,” he said.",https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/0624-NWS-BHR-L-traffic-cc01.jpg?w=1024&h=768,N,,2025-06-01 06:01:22.146389

India, a major carbon emitter, is aggressively expanding its clean energy sector, with solar power becoming increasingly cost-effective. While coal still dominates electricity generation, renewable energy capacity is rapidly growing, driven by government policies and private investments. Challenges remain in optimizing renewable energy use and building necessary infrastructure to meet the nation's soaring energy demands and climate goals.

One of the most carbon-polluting countries, India is also making huge efforts to harness the power of the sun, wind and other clean energy sources. Most of the electricity in India, the world's most populous nation, still comes from coal, one of the dirtiest forms of energy. But coal's dominance is dropping, going from 60% of installed power capacity 11 years ago to less than 50% today, according to India's power ministry.

At the same time, India had its largest ever addition of clean power in the fiscal year between April 2024 and April of this year, adding 30 gigawatts - enough to power nearly 18 million Indian homes.

With a growing middle class and skyrocketing energy needs, how fast India can move away from coal and other fossil fuels, such as gasoline and oil, could have a large impact on global efforts to confront climate change.

Here is a snapshot of India's clean energy transition and some of the challenges.

Renewable energy is now the most economical option Solar is now half the cost of power from new coal-powered plants. Availability of cheap components and many sunny days each year in India are some reasons experts say installed solar power increased 30 times in the last decade.

Live Events

""Solar power is the cheapest it's ever been,"" said Ruchita Shah, an energy analyst at climate think-tank Ember. Shah added that dropping costs for energy storage, in the form of batteries, means that renewable power will be the ""new normal,"" even when the sun doesn't shine or the wind doesn't blow.

India has nearly 170 gigawatts of renewable energy projects in the pipeline, which are expected to be completed in the next few years.

""I have no doubt that India will reach its target of 500 gigawatts by 2030,"" said Raghav Pachouri, an energy expert at Vasudha Foundation, a New Delhi-based think-tank.

Government policies and private investments push renewables Experts say the growth in renewables is being spurred by India's plans to add approximately 50 gigawatts of non-fossil fuel power capacity every year for the next five years and for clean power to provide 50% of the nation's energy by the decade. When burned, fossil fuels let off greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, the main driver of climate change.

A 2022 law that made electricity cheaper for companies choosing to buy clean power, the federal government's recommendation that state utilities buy more renewable power and a 2023 government plan to invest $452 million have all catalyzed investments in renewables.

India has the fourth highest amount of clean power installed in the world and government officials said $81 billion has been invested in the renewable energy sector in the last decade. Multiple large-scale renewable power projects have begun operations or are under construction, including one of the world's largest wind and solar power farms.

""We've seen domestic manufacturing capacity, at least when it comes to modules for solar panels, increasing,"" said Madhura Joshi, a senior energy analyst at the European think-tank E3G.

Still, renewables are underutilized Despite the rapid growth, challenges persist. While non-fossil fuel sources now comprise 45% of India's total installed capacity, their share in actual electricity generation stood at 24% last year. Coal remains the dominant source, accounting for 75% of electricity generation.

The share of solar, wind, small hydro power and biomass in India's electricity generation mix stood at 12%, double what it was in 2014 but still lower than expectations by this time, according to a report by New Delhi-based think-tank, the Centre for Science and Environment.

Installed capacity is growing, but power generation from renewables needs to be optimized and integrated effectively into the grid, the report found.

At a clean energy crossroads A recent report by the nonprofit clean energy think-tank, RMI, found that electricity demand is expected to triple by 2050 - driven by more electric vehicles, air conditioners and industrial growth.

Acquiring land for clean energy projects remains a challenge. India also needs to rapidly build robust electricity transmission infrastructure and energy storage facilities to continue increasing clean power capacity.

""India is expected to become the world's third-largest economy in a few years, and I think we will need to adopt renewable energy to do this. There is no option for us because fossil fuels can't keep pace"" with energy needs, said Deepak Thakur, chief executive officer of Mumbai-based renewable energy company, Mahindra Susten.

In Charlotte, it was AVL Manufacturing, promising to build a new production facility resulting in 325 new jobs.

In Holly Springs, it was biotechnology company Genentech, announcing plans to build a new manufacturing plant with 420 jobs.

In Goldsboro, it was transformer manufacturer Prolec-GE Waukesha, also with a new manufacturing plant, and 330 jobs.

Those are just three of a slew of businesses coming to the state this year.

So it was no surprise that when Stein delivered a speech at the Emerging Issues Forum on energy at N.C. State University this week, the subject went beyond policy to talk about the economy and business.

Good morning and welcome to the Sunday Under the Dome newsletter, which focuses on the governor. I’m Capitol Bureau Chief Dawn Vaughan.

In his speech at N.C. State on Wednesday, Stein said that while the state has more work ahead to reduce pollution and have a clean tech economy, “in many ways, the market demands that we do.”

“Nearly half of the leading companies in the world have a net zero emissions target. Many of these companies want to call North Carolina home. In fact, many of them already do: Amazon, Google, Meta, Toyota, Honeywell. When these companies decided where to invest, they were looking for a strong workforce, a favorable business environment, an excellent quality of life and places where they could get inexpensive, clean and reliable electricity,” Stein said.

He talked about another one of his economic development announcements, held in April in Greenville, when Boviet Solar opened a new solar module factory.

“Boviet is a powerful addition to our supply chain that includes a roster of 220 solar companies that are helping to provide more low-carbon energy sources,” Commerce Secretary Lee Lilley said at the time.

“They have already hired 400 employees, nearly, and they’re going to keep hiring. If things progress as they fully expect, when they get to phase two, that number should increase to over 1,000 employees, making them one of the largest private sector employers in the county of Pitt,” Stein said in his energy speech this past week.

“We are a top 10 state in the nation in the number of clean energy jobs, more than 100,000 workers in the clean energy sector. Unfortunately, some in Congress want to slow our growth,” Stein said, referring to the gutting of clean energy tax credits in the huge U.S. House bill passed this month.

Talking to reporters after his speech, Stein said he’s told North Carolinian members of Congress about “the urgency that we keep those tax credits.”

“Here’s the thing. Companies make investments based on policy, and there has to be certainty, there has to be settled expectations, or else they do not know how to invest,” he said.

“They were told that these credits existed. Many of them have made major business decisions about investing in North Carolina. We’ve got to preserve those credits so that the companies get the bargain that they struck.”

But one important aspect of taxation has been largely ignored: tax credits.

Tax credits were included in the Inflation Reduction Act from the Biden administration and, along with discounts on the purchase and installation of energy-efficient electric appliances, vehicles, solar systems and more, have allowed great progress toward a more sustainable energy economy in addition to creating jobs and investment in new industries, as well as benefiting Americans who took advantage of them.

A national poll conducted by Yale University’s Communication Program on Climate Change found that 63% of Nevadans are worried about climate change, identical to the national average. That number was 1% higher in Clark County, and 6% higher in Washoe County. This is significant in a state that has the two fastest-warming cities in the country, Reno and Las Vegas.

Most people likely understand that the driving force behind the worsening climate is the burning of fossil fuels. Giving people concrete steps they can take really activates them. And tax credits have done just that. Many have embraced the opportunity to replace their fossil fuel cars and appliances with those that utilize sustainable electric energy; these purchases of replacements have been amplified by the discounts and tax credits available to them, usually up to 30% or more.

The additional benefit of tax credits is the energy savings; more money in people’s pockets because their energy bills are lower. This has a direct impact on the economy in two ways: Americans have more money to spend on other things, and there are more jobs created for industries that provide the new appliances, cars, solar systems and more. Indeed, Nevada has been identified as one of the top states for jobs in the solar industry.

Each year the potential energy savings can be hundreds of dollars. Think of the benefit to lower-income people when they don’t have to spend $300 or more a month just to feel comfortable in their home; there is evidence that some people simply avoid turning on their air conditioner when the temperature soars because they can’t afford it. In Clark County, extreme heat’s death toll in 2024 was 527. Tax credits, especially for solar, can help save lives.

Now that the reconciliation bill goes to the Senate for markup, we must contact our senators to insist that tax credits be included. This isn’t a partisan issue: Republicans from rural areas say sustainable energy infrastructure such as solar and wind in their areas is very popular, because the taxes from increased revenue have paved the way for desirable and necessary civic improvements. As the demand for sustainable energy grows, the desirability of tax credits increases. Our senators must encourage their Republican colleagues to join them in voting for maintaining tax credits.",https://assets.lasvegassun.com/media/assets/images/icons/favicon-app.png,N,,2025-06-01 06:01:26.115338

“People in the U.S. don’t know about [floating solar] yet,” said Scott Young, a former policy analyst in the Nevada state legislature’s counsel bureau.
As recently as 2022, according to a Bloomberg analysis, most of the world’s 13 gigawatts of floating solar capacity had been built in Asia.
Some of a dam’s energy could come from solar panels floating on its reservoir to prevent water from being released solely to generate electricity.
Young grew up in the San Francisco Bay area, about 40 miles, he estimated, from the pioneering floating solar panels in Napa.","GILA RIVER INDIAN RESERVATION, Ariz.—About 33 miles south of Phoenix, Interstate 10 bisects a line of solar panels traversing the desert like an iridescent snake. The solar farm’s shape follows the path of a canal, with panels serving as awnings to shade the gently flowing water from the unforgiving heat and wind of the Sonoran Desert.

The panels began generating power last November for the Akimel O’otham and Pee Posh tribes—known together as the Gila River Indian Community, or GRIC—on their reservation in south-central Arizona, and they are the first of their kind in the U.S. The community is studying the effects of these panels on the water in the canal, hopeful that they will protect a precious resource from the desert’s unflinching sun and wind.

In September, GRIC is planning to break ground on another experimental effort to conserve water while generating electricity: floating solar. Between its canal canopies and the new project that would float photovoltaic panels on a reservoir it is building, GRIC hopes to one day power all of its canal and irrigation operations with solar electricity, transforming itself into one of the most innovative and closely-watched water users in the West in the process.

The community’s investments come at a critical time for the Colorado River, which supplies water to about 40 million people across seven Western states, Mexico and 30 tribes, including GRIC. Annual consumption from the river regularly exceeds its supply, and a decades-long drought, fueled in part by climate change, continues to leave water levels at Lake Powell and Lake Mead dangerously low.

Covering water with solar panels is not a new idea. But for some it represents an elegant mitigation of water shortages in the West. Doing so could reduce evaporation, generate more carbon-free electricity and require dams to run less frequently to produce power.

But, so far, the technology has not been included in the ongoing Colorado River negotiations between the Upper Basin states of Colorado, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming, the Lower Basin states of Arizona, California and Nevada, tribes and Mexico. All are expected to eventually agree on cuts to the system’s water allocations to maintain the river’s ability to provide water and electricity for residents and farms, and keep its ecosystem alive.

“People in the U.S. don’t know about [floating solar] yet,” said Scott Young, a former policy analyst in the Nevada state legislature’s counsel bureau. “They’re not willing to look at it and try and factor it” into the negotiations.

Several Western water managers Inside Climate News contacted for this story said they were open to learning more about floating solar—Colorado has even studied the technology through pilot projects. But, outside of GRIC’s project, none knew of any plans to deploy floating solar anywhere in the basin. Some listed costly and unusual construction methods and potentially modest water savings as the primary obstacles to floating solar maturing in the U.S.

A Tantalizing Technology With Tradeoffs

A winery in Napa County, California, deployed the first floating solar panels in the U.S. on an irrigation pond in 2007. The country was still years away from passing federal legislation to combat the climate crisis, and the technology matured here haltingly. As recently as 2022, according to a Bloomberg analysis, most of the world’s 13 gigawatts of floating solar capacity had been built in Asia.

Unlike many Asian countries, the U.S. has an abundance of undeveloped land where solar could be constructed, said Prateek Joshi, a research engineer at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) who has studied floating solar, among other forms of energy. “Even though [floating solar] may play a smaller role, I think it’s a critical role in just diversifying our energy mix and also reducing the burden of land use,” he said.

This February, NREL published a study that found floating solar on the reservoirs behind federally owned dams could provide enough electricity to power 100 million U.S. homes annually, but only if all the developable space on each reservoir were used.

Lake Powell could host almost 15 gigawatts of floating solar using about 23 percent of its surface area, and Lake Mead could generate over 17 gigawatts of power on 28 percent of its surface. Such large-scale development is “probably not going to be the case,” Joshi said, but even if a project used only a fraction of the developable area, “there’s a lot of power you could get from a relatively small percentage of these Colorado Basin reservoirs.”

The study did not measure how much water evaporation floating solar would prevent, but previous NREL research has shown that photovoltaic panels—sometimes called “floatovoltaics” when they are deployed on reservoirs—could also save water by changing the way hydropower is deployed.

Some of a dam’s energy could come from solar panels floating on its reservoir to prevent water from being released solely to generate electricity. As late as December, when a typical Western dam would be running low, lakes with floating solar could still have enough water to produce hydropower, reducing reliance on more expensive backup energy from gas-fired power plants.

Joshi has spoken with developers and water managers about floating solar before, and said there is “an eagerness to get this [technology] going.” The technology, however, is not flawless.

Solar arrays can be around 20 percent more expensive to install on water than land, largely because of the added cost of buoys that keep the panels afloat, according to a 2021 NREL report. The water’s cooling effect can boost panel efficiency, but floating solar panels may produce slightly less energy than a similarly sized array on land because they can’t be tilted as directly toward the sun as land-based panels.

And while the panels likely reduce water loss from reservoirs, they may also increase a water body’s emissions of greenhouse gases, which in turn warm the climate and increase evaporation. This January, researchers at Cornell University found that floating solar covering more than 70 percent of a pond’s surface area increased the water’s CO2 and methane emissions. These kinds of impacts “should be considered not only for the waterbody in which [floating solar] is deployed but also in the broader context of trade-offs of shifting energy production from land to water,” the study’s authors wrote.

“Any energy technology has its tradeoffs,” Joshi said, and in the case of floating solar, some of its benefits—reduced evaporation and land use—may not be easy to express in dollars and cents.

Silver Buckshot

There is perhaps no bigger champion for floating solar in the West than Scott Young. Before he retired in 2016, he spent much of his 18 years working for the Nevada Legislature researching the effects of proposed legislation, especially in the energy sector.

On an overcast, blustery May day in southwest Wyoming near his home, Young said that in the past two years he has promoted the technology to Colorado River negotiators, members of Congress, environmental groups and other water managers from the seven basin states, all of whom he has implored to consider the virtues of floating solar arrays on Lake Powell and Lake Mead.

Young grew up in the San Francisco Bay area, about 40 miles, he estimated, from the pioneering floating solar panels in Napa. He stressed that he does not have any ties to industry; he is just a concerned Westerner who wants to diversify the region’s energy mix and save as much water as possible.

But so far, when he has been able to get someone’s attention, Young said his pitch has been met with tepid interest. “Usually the response is: ‘Eh, that’s kind of interesting,’” said Young, dressed in a black jacket, a maroon button-down shirt and a matching ball cap that framed his round, open face. “But there’s no follow-up.”

The Bureau of Reclamation “has not received any formal proposals for floating solar on its reservoirs,” said an agency spokesperson, who added that the bureau has been monitoring the technology.

In a 2021 paper published with NREL, Reclamation estimated that floating solar on its reservoirs could generate approximately 1.5 terawatts of electricity, enough to power about 100 million homes. But, in addition to potentially interfering with recreation, aquatic life and water safety, floating solar’s effect on evaporation proved difficult to model broadly.

So many environmental factors determine how water is lost or consumed in a reservoir—solar intensity, wind, humidity, lake circulation, water depth and temperature—that the study’s authors concluded Reclamation “should be wary of contractors’ claims of evaporation savings” without site-specific studies. Those same factors affect the panels’ efficiency, and in turn, how much hydropower would need to be generated from the reservoir they cover.

The report also showed the Colorado River was ripe with floating solar potential—more than any other basin in the West. That’s particularly true in the Upper Basin, where Young has been heartened by Colorado’s approach to the technology.

In 2023, the state passed a law requiring several agencies to study the use of floating solar. Last December, the Colorado Water Conservation Board published its findings, and estimated that the state could save up to 407,000 acre feet of water by deploying floating solar on certain reservoirs. An acre foot covers one acre with a foot of water, or 325,851 gallons, just about three year’s worth of water for a family of four.

When Young saw the Colorado study quantifying savings from floating solar, he felt hopeful. “407,000 acre feet from one state,” he said. “I was hoping that would catch people’s attention.”

Saving that much water would require using over 100,000 acres of surface water, said Cole Bedford, the Colorado Water Conservation Board’s chief operating officer, in an email. “On some of these reservoirs a [floating solar] system would diminish the recreational value such that it would not be appropriate,” he said. “On others, recreation, power generation, and water savings could be balanced.”

Colorado is not planning to develop another project in the wake of this study, and Bedford said that the technology is not a silver bullet solution for Colorado River negotiations.

“While floating solar is one tool in the toolkit for water conservation, the only true solution to the challenges facing the Colorado River Basin is a shift to supply-driven, sustainable uses and operations,” he said.

Some of the West’s largest and driest cities, like Phoenix and Denver, ferry Colorado River water to residents hundreds of miles away from the basin using a web of infrastructure that must reliably operate in unforgiving terrain. Like their counterparts at the state level, water managers in these cities have heard floatovoltaics floated before, but they say the technology is currently too immature and costly to be deployed in the U.S.

In Arizona, the Central Arizona Project (CAP) delivers much of the Colorado River water used by Phoenix, Tucson, tribes and other southern Arizona communities with a 336-mile canal running through the desert, and Lake Pleasant, the company’s 811,784-acre-foot reservoir.

Though CAP is following GRIC’s deployment of solar over canals, it has no immediate plans to build solar over its canal, or Lake Pleasant, according to Darrin Francom, CAP’s assistant general manager for operations, power, engineering and maintenance, in part because the city of Peoria technically owns the surface water.

Covering the whole canal with solar to save the 4,000 acre feet that evaporates from it could be prohibitively expensive for CAP. “The dollar cost per that acre foot [saved] is going to be in the tens of, you know, maybe even hundreds of thousands of dollars,” Francom said, mainly due to working with novel equipment and construction methods. “Ultimately,” he continued, “those costs are going to be borne by our ratepayers,” which gives CAP reason to pursue other lower-cost ways to save water, like conservation programs, or to seek new sources.

The increased costs associated with building solar panels on water instead of on land has made such projects unpalatable to Denver Water, Colorado’s largest water utility, which moves water out of the Colorado River Basin and through the Rocky Mountains to customers on the Front Range. “Floating solar doesn’t pencil out for us for many reasons,” said Todd Hartman, a company spokesperson. “Were we to add more solar resources—which we are considering—we have abundant land-based options.”

GRIC spent about $5.6 million, financed with Inflation Reduction Act grants, to construct 3,000 feet of solar over a canal, according to David DeJong, project director for the community’s irrigation district.

“If you can save water in two ways—why not?”

— Scott Young, former Nevada policy analyst

Young is aware there is no single solution to the problems plaguing the Colorado River Basin, and he knows floating solar is not a perfect technology. Instead, he thinks of it as a “silver buckshot,” he said, borrowing a term from John Entsminger, general manager for the Southern Nevada Water Authority—a technology that can be deployed alongside a constellation of behavioral changes to help keep the Colorado River alive.

Given the duration and intensity of the drought in the West and the growing demand for water and clean energy, Young believes the U.S. needs to act now to embed this technology into the fabric of Western water management going forward.

As drought in the West intensifies, “I think more lawmakers are going to look at this,” he said. “If you can save water in two ways—why not?”

“We’re Not Going to Know Until We Try”

If all goes according to plan, GRIC’s West Side Reservoir will be finished and ready to store Colorado River water by the end of July. The community wants to cover just under 60 percent of the lake’s surface area with floating solar.

“Do we know for a fact that this is going to be 100 percent effective and foolproof? No,” said DeJong, GRIC’s project director for its irrigation district. “But we’re not going to know until we try.”

GRIC’s panels will have a few things going for them that projects on lakes Mead or Powell probably wouldn’t. West Side Reservoir will not be open to recreation, limiting the panels’ impacts on people. And the community already has the funds—Inflation Reduction Act grants and some of its own money—to pay for the project.

But GRIC’s solar ambitions may be threatened by the hostile posture toward solar and wind energy from the White House and congressional Republicans, and the project is vulnerable to an increasingly volatile economy. Since retaking office, President Donald Trump, aided by billionaire Elon Musk, has made deep cuts in renewable energy grants at the Environmental Protection Agency. It is unclear whether or to what extent the Bureau of Reclamation has slashed its grant programs.

“Under President Donald J. Trump’s leadership, the Department is working to cut bureaucratic waste and ensure taxpayer dollars are spent efficiently,” said a spokesperson for the Department of the Interior, which oversees Reclamation. “This includes ensuring Bureau of Reclamation projects that use funds from the Infrastructure Investments and Jobs Act and the Inflation Reduction Act align with administration priorities. Projects are being individually assessed by period of performance, criticality, and other criteria. Projects have been approved for obligation under this process so that critical work can continue.”

And Trump’s tariffs could cause costs to balloon beyond the community’s budget, which could either reduce the size of the array or cause delays in soliciting proposals, DeJong said.

“I know for a fact this is inspiring a whole new generation of water protectors—those that want to come back and they want to go into this cutting-edge technology.”

— GRIC Governor Stephen Roe Lewis

While the community will study the panels over canals to understand the water’s effects on solar panel efficiency, it won’t do similar research on the panels on West Side Reservoir, though DeJong said they have been in touch with NREL about studying them. The enterprise will be part of the system that may one day offset all the electrical demand and carbon footprint of GRIC’s irrigation system.

“The community, they love these types of innovative projects. I love these innovative projects,” said GRIC Governor Stephen Roe Lewis, standing in front of the canals in April. Lewis had his dark hair pulled back in a long ponytail and wore a blue button down that matched the color of the sky.

“I know for a fact this is inspiring a whole new generation of water protectors—those that want to come back and they want to go into this cutting-edge technology,” he said. “I couldn’t be more proud of our team for getting this done.”

DeJong feels plenty of other water managers across the West could learn from what is happening at GRIC. In fact, the West Side Reservoir was intentionally constructed near Interstate 10 so that people driving by on the highway could one day see the floating solar the community intends to build there, DeJong said.

“It could be a paradigm shift in the Western United States,” he said. “We recognize all of the projects we’re doing are pilot projects. None of them are large scale. But it’s the beginning.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/041925_Bolster_AZ_019-1024x679.jpg,N,,2025-06-01 08:00:53.026605

With planned investments and timely implementation, the country can steer its power and energy sectors in the right direction and meet its renewable energy targets.","Bangladesh’s interim government is preparing to unveil its first budget on 2 June 2025 amid high expectations of a balanced allocation of funds to streamline the country’s energy transition. A prudent budgetary assessment by the government is much needed given that the power sector’s subsidy burden is reportedly expected to soar by 55% year-on-year in the fiscal year (FY) 2024-25. This is despite the electricity price hike by more than 20% between January 2023 and February 2024.

Bangladesh should follow a merit order dispatch – using the lowest-cost power sources first and then moving to the more expensive ones if demand increases – to bring down its subsidy burden. This opens up opportunities for government intervention – supporting renewable energy capacity addition to ease the transition from oil-fired power and investing in grid modernisation.

Furthermore, the system loss in Bangladesh’s gas sector, which hovers around 7%, calls for budgetary support to revamp gas distribution networks.

While Bangladesh will need a long-term strategy to stave off its energy and power sector challenges, the next budget can lay the foundation for an orderly transition.

Reducing the Power Sector’s Subsidies

Bangladesh needs to gradually reduce oil-fired power generation to limit subsidies. To do this, the government should incentivise renewable energy expansion through budgetary support.

i. Limiting the share of oil-fired power in total generation

In FY2023-24, the cost of oil-fired power was more than two times compared to the average power generation cost. If purchases from oil-fired plants are excluded, the average generation cost comes down to Tk9.54/kWh (US$0.078/kWh). In turn, this can lower the sector’s subsidies.

Earlier this year, the government initiated steps to reduce the share of oil-fired power in total power generation. After a temporary decline in January 2025, the share of oil-based power generation rebounded between February and April 2025, contributing to 10.27% of grid-based power and 29.27% of total fuel costs (Figure 1 highlights the days when the share of oil-fired power was considerably high). This pattern mirrors the trend seen in 2024.

The Ministry of Power, Energy and Mineral Resources (MPEMR) should strive to reduce oil-based power generation from FY2025-26, based on the estimates of the Bangladesh Power Development Board. As the Ministry of Finance allocates sectoral subsidies, this assessment will help the MPEMR and the Ministry of Finance to phase down power sector subsidies.

ii. Incentivising renewable energy uptake

With declining costs and improving technologies, Bangladesh can lower its overall power purchase cost by deploying cheaper renewable energy. However, since the utility-scale projects’ pipeline is empty and land acquisition poses a challenge, the upcoming budget can allocate part of the Public-Private-Partnership fund to support land acquisition and attract private investment.

Further, the government can provide a duty waiver on imported accessories to incentivise rooftop solar and solar irrigation expansion as quickfire solutions.

As solar irrigation systems are not viable without a grant of around 50% of the capital cost, the government can enlarge the renewable energy funding base of Tk1 billion (US$8.2 million) established in last year’s budget, and allocate a part of it as viability gap funding for the accelerated implementation of solar irrigation projects. The government can let the Infrastructure Development Company Limited, which has significant experience in financing solar irrigation, utilise this subsidy. With this support, microfinance institutions working in rural areas can also scale up solar irrigation projects.

These steps will help the country achieve its goals of attaining 6,145 megawatts (MW) and 17,470MW of renewable energy by 2030 and 2041, respectively, as set out in the Renewable Energy Policy 2025.

Supporting Grid Modernisation

As Bangladesh’s variable renewable energy capacity is likely to surge in the next five years, the old electricity grid becomes a bottleneck. With a greater share of variable renewable energy, old grid may experience stability issues.

While the previous budget allocated Tk10,634 crore (US$0.87 billion) for grid expansion and modernisation, and the development of power evacuation systems, the new budget should continue to fund grid modernisation.

Bringing Down the Gas Sector’s System Loss

Bangladesh could not utilise 68.6 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of gas in 2024 due to a system loss of 7% (total consumption recorded in 2024 was 980Bcf) resulting from old pipelines in the gas distribution network and pilferage. By limiting the gas sector’s system loss to 2% from 7%, Bangladesh can save at least 49Bcf of gas per annum (5% of the 980Bcf consumed in 2024), reducing LNG imports worth US$497 million per annum (taking an LNG price of US$10.5/metric million British thermal units (MMBtu)). Prudent budgetary allocation can help the country’s gas distribution companies invest in replacing old gas pipelines. Besides, the country should deploy a team to monitor gas pilferage, which also contributes to system loss. As the country’s fossil fuel imports continue to swell, budgetary support to reduce this system loss is crucial.

The sustainability of Bangladesh’s energy and power sectors hinges on strategic budgetary allocation.

Musk’s exit raises questions about Tesla’s sales slump and competition

SpaceX faces setbacks with rocket program

Musk’s focus shifts to robotaxi launch

Tesla shares down 25% since December

By Aditya Soni, Kritika Lamba

May 29 (Reuters) – Elon Musk’s break with the Trump administration means investors will hope he refocuses on his sprawling empire as Tesla TSLA.O battles slumping sales and after SpaceX’s latest rocket launch fell short of expectations.

Musk called time on his White House stint on Wednesday, giving Tesla investors some succor after shares slumped this year in part due to the backlash to his support of U.S. President Donald Trump and right-wing parties in Europe. The billionaire also spearheaded Trump’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency, charged with cutting federal spending, which generated controversy.

He now returns to his empire facing several challenges, but also numerous advantages. Tesla’s sales slide is testing investor patience, yet SpaceX and Starlink dominate their respective markets, often serving as the default choice for commercial launches and satellite internet deployment. Foreign governments have also increasingly looked to Starlink, with regulatory approvals smoothed by Musk’s close ties to Trump.

That relationship, however, has drawn scrutiny. Shortly before he announced his exit from Washington, Musk criticized the tax bill that is making its way through Congress. In addition, he had recently pledged to spend less money on politics after he plunked down nearly $300 million on Trump’s presidential campaign and on other Republican candidates last year.

Tesla shares were little changed in afternoon trading on Thursday, but they have lost about 25% of their value since mid-December. The stock initially soared due to Musk’s relationship with Trump and expectations for swift regulatory approval for the company’s widely awaited robotaxis. They reversed course as sales dropped and protests erupted against Musk’s embrace of far-right politicians and his role in firing U.S. federal workers.

Analysts say deeper operational fixes are needed to reverse its sales slump, however, as EV buyers increasingly seek out competitors, particularly in the fast-growing Chinese market.

“Musk’s departure from DOGE will improve market sentiment, but I see no real change for Tesla,” said Morningstar analyst Seth Goldstein.

“Tesla’s deliveries decline shows its current product lineup is at market saturation and facing strong competition in all three key markets of the U.S., China and Europe.”

With a forward price-to-earnings ratio of roughly 165, according to LSEG data, Tesla remains far more expensive than other Big Tech giants like Nvidia NVDA.O or Microsoft MSFT.O, not to mention conventional auto companies. Bullish analysts, such as Wedbush’s Dan Ives, have long contended that Tesla’s future value is tied to autonomous driving, which Ives said on Thursday could be worth about “$1 trillion alone for Tesla.”

Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

RELATIONSHIP WITH TRUMP

Musk’s companies have benefited from his relationship with Trump. Reuters reported last week that Musk’s DOGE team was expanding use of his artificial intelligence chatbot Grok in the U.S. federal government to analyze data. Experts told Reuters that this could give Musk access to valuable nonpublic federal contracting data at agencies with which he privately does business, and give him an advantage over other AI service providers.

Trump’s cabinet will continue to work with DOGE employees across various federal agencies, the White House said on Thursday, even as at least one member of Musk’s team was set to depart. Steve Davis, a close associate of Musk and key in running the agency’s day-to-day operations, has stepped down from his DOGE leadership role, according to a source familiar with the matter.

SpaceX’s launch this week failed more quickly than expected, exploding over the Indian Ocean without achieving some of its most important testing goals. The result puts another pause in Musk’s speedy development goals for the rocket, which is bound to play a central role in the U.S. space program. Federal regulators had granted SpaceX a license for Starship’s latest flight attempt four days ago, capping an investigation of a mishap that had grounded Starship for nearly two months.

SpaceX has long had its own management team led by Gwynne Shotwell, though after the latest launch, Musk said he planned to spend more time on the company. The Starship rocket is still many steps away from being able to land humans on the moon or Mars.

“He’s not an official part of the government, but obviously maintains connections,” said Thomas Martin, senior portfolio manager at Tesla investor Globalt Investments. “So I think there’s a slight diminishment of influence at the margin, but I don’t think it’s going to move the needle on regulatory matters anyway.”

Musk has been quiet for months about legislation in Congress that takes aim at electric vehicles, but late on Wednesday, Tesla Energy criticized Republican plans to end energy tax credits. “Abruptly ending the energy tax credits would threaten America’s energy independence and the reliability of our grid,” Tesla Energy wrote on its X account. The Republican tax plan could cut tax breaks for electric vehicle purchases and leases, phase out battery production credits and cut clean-energy incentives for solar.

Tesla’s robotaxi launch next month is crucial to Musk’s plan to shift focus from an affordable electric vehicle to autonomous vehicles and the company’s Optimus humanoid robots.

Shortly after news of his Washington departure, Musk said Tesla has been testing driverless Model Y cars in Austin, Texas, with plans to deliver the first vehicles in June.",https://bilyonaryo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/tesla-1.jpg,N,,2025-06-01 06:01:35.270669

This latest study finding needs to be a point of concern for Indonesia, which is currently beginning to shift to electric vehicles but has not yet been accompanied by an accelerated transition to renewable energy sources.

A study by researchers from the University of Auckland and Xiamen University in China, published in the February 2025 issue of the journal Energy, shows that carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions in a country that switches to electric vehicles (EVs) actually increase if the country's electricity source still relies on fossil fuels. The report was written by Miaomiao Tao and Stephen Poletti from the Energy Centre, Department of Economics, Business School, The University of Auckland, New Zealand, and Boqiang Lin from the China Institute for Studies in Energy Policy, Xiamen University, China.

Tao, a doctoral candidate under the supervision of Poletti, stated in a release issued by his university on Wednesday (9/4/2025) that data indicates the increasing use of electricity worldwide has not led to a significant reduction in global CO₂ emissions. ""On the contrary, the adoption of electric vehicles is positively correlated with CO₂ emissions,"" said Tao.

He acknowledged that this finding appears to contradict previous intuition. This discovery, he stated, challenges the common belief that electric vehicles contribute to decarbonization.

In this study, researchers analyzed the environmental impact of human activities and used a statistical approach to investigate the drivers of CO₂ emission increases in a country. Using data from 26 countries over 15 years, they found a trend indicating that higher EV usage is associated with increased CO₂ emissions. The reason is that, in several countries, EVs are still powered by electricity generated through the combustion of fossil fuels such as coal or oil.

“Our analysis highlights that the environmental benefits of electric vehicles depend on the composition of a country’s power generation mix,” Tao said.

According to this study, New Zealand, where more than 80 percent of its electricity generation comes from renewable energy, is well-positioned to reap the benefits of EVs. ""This research serves as a reminder that transportation decarbonization cannot be done in isolation,"" said Poletti.

On the other hand, according to this study, countries like Indonesia, where in 2022 only about 19.6 percent of its total electricity production came from renewable energy sources, actually experienced an increase in CO₂ emissions due to the rising use of EVs. So far, the contribution of renewable energy in Indonesia primarily comes from hydroelectric power plants, geothermal energy, biomass, and, to a lesser extent, solar and wind energy.

Poleeti explained that if electric vehicles are charged using electricity generated from coal-fired power plants, the CO₂ emissions produced could actually be higher than those from gasoline or diesel-powered vehicles. ""In this case, electric vehicles can indirectly contribute to higher emissions compared to modern gasoline or diesel-powered vehicles, especially when considering the entire lifecycle from production to disposal,"" he said.

<strong>Renewable power generation</strong>

The study found that the adoption of electric vehicles would only contribute to reducing CO₂ emissions if the global share of renewable electricity generation reached around 48 percent. According to Poleti, renewables, mainly wind, solar and hydro, will only account for a little over 30 percent of the world’s electricity in 2023, so there is still a way to go if the world is serious about reducing CO2 emissions from electric vehicles.

""Electric vehicles are often seen as a magic bullet for climate change, but our results show that this is not the case if the electricity that powers them is not clean,"" Poleti said.

The study concluded that EVs are only environmentally friendly if they are connected to the electricity grid, and government policies should aim to increase the adoption and integration of renewable energy such as solar and hydro. ""This can be achieved by setting ambitious renewable energy targets and providing adequate subsidies such as tax credits to renewable energy producers and consumers,"" he said.

Poletti said investments in smart grids and transmission networks can improve the efficiency and reliability of renewable energy supplies. Therefore, policies should support community-based renewable energy projects, which can increase public acceptance of renewable energy installations.

The researchers further said that eliminating subsidies for fossil fuels and implementing carbon pricing mechanisms could also provide incentives for renewable energy development. “The adoption of electric vehicles could help countries meet climate targets, as long as the energy used to power them is clean,” Tao said.

In addition to electric vehicle use, the researchers examined the impact of economic growth, green technology innovation, renewable energy consumption, and population density on emissions.

They found that economic growth increases emissions, while innovation in green technologies and population density, in the form of denser cities, can help reduce emissions. The use of renewable energy has the most significant emission-reducing effect.",https://assetd.kompas.id/j__XGPr6Yo2sRO0g8lrwXNvc9Og=/fit-in/1024x875/filters:format(webp):quality(80)/https://cdn-dam.kompas.id/images/2025/03/24/9d18096124cdd40d9d94e0957baee3bd-20250324WEN9.jpg,N,,2025-06-01 10:06:30.509906

The visit by Department of Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin comes after Trump signed an executive order earlier this year aimed at boosting oil and gas drilling, mining and logging in Alaska. It also comes amid tariff talks with Asian countries that are seen as possible leverage for the administration to secure investments in the proposed Alaska liquefied natural gas project.

Their itinerary includes a meeting Sunday with resource development groups and U.S. Sens. Dan Sullivan and Lisa Murkowski in Anchorage before heading to Utqiagvik, an Arctic town on the petroleum-rich North Slope where many Alaska Native leaders see oil development as economically vital to the region.

The federal officials also plan to visit the Prudhoe Bay oil field Monday — near the coast of the Arctic Ocean and more than 850 miles (1,368 kilometers) north of Anchorage — and speak at Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy's annual energy conference Tuesday in Anchorage.

While it's not unusual for U.S. officials to visit Alaska during warmer weather months, Dunleavy's office said the officials' visit is significant. Dunleavy, a Trump ally, said he is thankful for an administration that “recognizes Alaska's unique value.”

Government and industry representatives from a number of Asian countries, including Japan, are expected to participate in a portion of the trip, reflecting pressure from the U.S. to invest in the pipeline — despite skepticism and opposition from environmental groups.

In Alaska, some environmentalists criticized the agenda for Dunleavy's conference. Highlighting fossil fuels alongside renewable or alternative energy make “energy sources of the past look more legitimate at a conference like this,"" said Andy Moderow, senior policy director with the Alaska Wilderness League.

“I think we should be looking at climate solutions that work for Alaskans, not trying to open up places that industry is taking a pass on, namely the Arctic refuge,” he said.

Trump has long taken credit for provisions of a 2017 tax law championed by Alaska's congressional delegation that called for two oil and gas lease sales in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge's coastal plain by late 2024. The first one remains the subject of ongoing litigation, with the main bidder a state corporation that saw its seven leases later canceled by then-President Joe Biden's administration. A judge in March ruled Biden's administration overstepped, and the Interior Department, in line with Trump's executive order, is working to reinstate the leases.

There weren't any bids in the second sale, held under Biden and blasted by the state as overly restrictive.

Debate over drilling in the refuge — home to polar bears, musk ox, birds and other wildlife — has long been a flashpoint. Indigenous Gwich’in leaders consider the coastal plain sacred land, noting its importance to a caribou herd they rely upon.

Many North Slope Iñupiat leaders who support drilling in the refuge felt their voices were not heard during the Biden era. During the Trump officials' visit, they also hope to make a case for additional development in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska, which Trump has advocated, and for being included in planning decisions.

Nagruk Harcharek, president of Voice of the Arctic Iñupiat, an advocacy group whose members include leaders from the region, called the officials' visit “a step in the right direction.”

For years, the state has sought to develop its stores of North Slope natural gas as a way to provide affordable energy to more residents and bolster revenues via exports. But cost concerns, shifts in direction, competition from other projects and questions about economic feasibility have stymied progress. Oil companies have long reinjected gas that occurs with oil deposits on the slope to produce more oil, which remains Alaska's economic lifeblood.

The latest gas proposal calls for a roughly 810-mile (1,300-kilometer) pipeline that would carry gas from the North Slope to port and a facility that would process and export liquefied natural gas to Asian countries. In a March speech to Congress, Trump touted his ongoing support of the “gigantic natural gas pipeline."" He said countries like Japan and South Korea “want to be our partner, with investments of trillions of dollars each.” No firm commitments from countries have been made.

The company advancing the project — in partnership with a state corporation — is in a stage of refining cost estimates, previously pegged at around $44 billion for the pipeline and related infrastructure, before final decisions are made on whether to move forward with the project.

While Dunleavy has likened Trump’s friendly approach to energy development as “Christmas every day,” Alaska's fortunes remain tightly linked to the volatility of oil prices, which are down sharply from a year ago, squeezing state revenues.

State lawmakers across party lines overwhelmingly passed a resolution urging Congress to provide Alaska with 90% of royalty revenues for oil and gas leases in the Arctic refuge, arguing the U.S. government reneged on past promises for such a share. The resolution also asked for that to be extended to the petroleum reserve.",https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/9471fb5d-9baa-472e-9682-3b4226058dea/wirestory_d9b2b70f3ada4eab89da303b2a5c745d_16x9.jpg?w=1600,N,,2025-06-01 05:03:00.764119

The commission said the order will benefit customers by ""flattening costs and help[ing] mitigate excessively high electricity bills during peak months.""
""Generally, Maryland has an acute imbalance between electricity supply and demand from customers,"" said BGE Spokesperson Nick Alexopulos.

The order requires BGE to shift recovery of some supply costs to lower-usage months over a six-month period. It means customers will pay less supply costs during the winter and summer, a time when bills are typically higher. However, they'll see an increase in the fall and spring when bills are lower.

The commission said the order will benefit customers by ""flattening costs and help[ing] mitigate excessively high electricity bills during peak months."" The commission originally considered this idea during an April meeting, after which the Commission requested and received proposals to spread costs over four-, six-, and twenty-four-month intervals.

Commission Chair Frederick Hoover said in a statement, ""The Commission took these actions to mitigate the impacts felt by customers as a result of higher-than-expected energy costs, coupled with potential high usage in the coming months.""

In response, BGE wrote in a statement: ""The Commission has decided to shift the recovery of some supply costs caused by last summer's PJM Capacity Auction results to lower-usage months over a six-month period. We will continue working with the Commission and parties to mitigate the impact of higher energy costs for our customers. In accordance with the PSC's order, adjusted residential electric supply rates will go into effect for usage starting June 1.""

The commission adds that they support the Maryland Office of People's Counsel and several other PJM state consumer advocates in a complaint against the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The complaint challenges high wholesale capacity prices, arguing that PJM's most recent capacity auction will impose unjust and unreasonable charges on ratepayers.

Electricity prices increase on June 1

BGE said the increase in electricity prices is the result of an unexpected spike in capacity auction prices and the Talen Energy reliability-must-run (RMR) fee. A capacity market auction is a competitive bidding process where power companies promise to make their electricity generation available in the future.

""Generally, Maryland has an acute imbalance between electricity supply and demand from customers,"" said BGE Spokesperson Nick Alexopulos.

He said customers are paying to keep some power plants, set to retire, online.

""Customers have to pay the owner of those power plants, Talen Energy, a certain fee called the reliability-must-run,"" Alexopulos said. ""They're going to have to pay that every month until the power plants retire.""

What is the Talen Energy RMR fee?

The Talen Energy RMR fee refers to the fixed payments made to Talen Energy for continuing to operate its Brandon Shores and H.A. Wagner power plants in Maryland, beyond their planned retirement dates.

PJM Interconnection, the regional grid operator, pays a fee of $312 per megawatt per day for the Brandon Shores plant, amounting to approximately $145 million annually, along with a $5 million performance incentive. For the H.A. Wagner plant, PJM pays a fee of $137 per megawatt per day, which totals about $35 million per year, plus a $2.5 million performance incentive.",https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/06/01/5ce7c964-61b5-464b-8c7e-ecab532d4d47/thumbnail/1200x630/9348b6afe7655fb7052653fac083fd39/power.png?v=15603985a4508c8e7bc83d8e4e73c5d0,N,,2025-06-01 05:02:49.369869

According to data from E2, a US-based group of business leaders and investors, $14 billion in clean energy projects supporting 10,000 jobs have been cancelled or postponed so far this year.
And beyond supporting clean power generation, local governments had a variety of strategies to tackle climate change, she said.
Key offices that are responsible for climate change monitoring, maintaining the nation's databases related to climate change and for a large fraction of climate education in US schools, colleges and universities have been closed.
""When you cut that off, you're basically killing the future of innovation in all these domains, in terms of environmental and public health and in solutions for climate change,"" he said.","Donald Trump’s campaign pledge to ""drill, baby, drill,"" struck fear into the hearts of climate campaigners, but it was music to the ears of Washington’s fossil fuel lobbyists.

And the US President didn’t waste any time delivering on his promises to Big Oil.

In a dizzying slew of executive orders on his first day in office, Mr Trump pulled the United States out of the Paris Agreement to limit global warming, rolled back Biden-era clean energy incentives, stripped away environmental restrictions on oil and gas exploration and threw a lifeline to America’s dying coal industry.

Leaving no doubt as to the direction of travel, the administration went on to initiate legal action against states over their climate policies, shutter federal climate research offices, scrub information on extreme weather tracking from government websites and even ban the use of paper straws in federal buildings.

""We’re going back to plastic,"" Mr Trump said as he signed the order, ""these things don’t work"".

The president has made no secret of his disdain for renewable energy projects either, calling wind turbines ""stupid"" and ""unsightly"" and freezing approvals for wind and solar projects on federal lands and water.

The administration is now reportedly preparing to eliminate limits on greenhouse gas emissions from coal and gas-fired power plants in the United States, which is already the world’s second-largest polluter.

For some analysts, Mr Trump’s policies could sound the death knell for America’s competitiveness in green energy, a field where other countries, like China, are already surging ahead.

""They're really taking a meat axe to the federal government's work, both on the science of climate change and the technology addressing climate change,"" Harvard professor John Holdren, who was science advisor to former President Barack Obama during his two terms, told RTÉ News.

Others, though, welcomed what they saw as the administration shifting focus to America’s own energy security, which they believed would benefit the US in the long term.

Energy security

""I think what we are seeing from President Trump and Republicans in Congress is a strategy that looks to balance a future that has abundant, affordable, reliable and lower emissions energy,"" said Jeremy Harrell, CEO of ClearPath, a conservative-leaning clean energy organisation, based in Washington DC.

Federal programmes were being reevaluated under President Trump to ensure they were ""economically viable"" as well as targeted towards technologies in which the US was in pole position to lead, Mr Harrell said, citing geothermal, nuclear and carbon-capture as examples.

Was this an acknowledgment that the US couldn’t compete with China in sectors like wind and solar, given that China now makes 80% of the world’s solar panels and dominates global wind turbine manufacturing?

There was certainly bi-partisan support in the US Congress, Mr Harrell said, to onshore US energy in an effort ""to reduce reliance on China and Chinese supply chains, and position the US as a technology leader globally, in areas where we have some strategic advantage"".

But other observers felt the moment for asserting any strategic advantage had come and gone.

""It is a travesty that the United States has not taken a leadership position on the clean energy future,"" said Caroline Spears head of Climate Cabinet, which advocates for pro-climate policies at the state and local levels.

She was also sceptical that the United States would be able to boost domestic industry and technology under current conditions.

""The amount of uncertainty and volatility being created is wild,"" said Ms Spears.

And when it comes to massive projects - like nuclear - there was a danger the administration would overpromise and underdeliver, she said.

The push on climate was going to have to come from individual states, she said.

The power of red states

Last week the US House of Representatives passed a major tax bill - dubbed the ""Big Beautiful Bill,"" - which gutted the clean energy credits established in former President Biden’s signature piece of legislation, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).

The bill is now on its way to the Senate, where it may well be watered down, experts said.

That’s partly because much of the financial benefits from the Inflation Reduction Act flowed to Republican-voting areas of the country.

Senators of these so-called ""red states"" will be reluctant to legislate against large renewable energy plants that have brought jobs to their constituencies and have proven popular with voters, experts told RTÉ News.

A recent poll carried out by the Conservative Texans for Energy Innovation found that 84 percent of Texans were in favour of renewable energy projects.

Although best known for its Stetson-sporting oil barons, Texas is now the nation’s leading producer of wind and solar power, having outstripped California some years ago.

Nationally, a long-term study carried out by the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication showed that more that three quarters of Americans supported renewable energy infrastructure on public land while 66% of people polled wanted a full transition away from fossil fuels to clean energy by mid-century.

All this leads to a degree of unstoppable momentum, analysts said.

""A lot of the progress we have made in the United States on the ground is not going to be reversed through policy changes,"" said Anthony Moffa, law professor at the University of Maine.

The deployment of more renewable energy or electric vehicle adoption are trends that are going to continue, he said, even without federal government incentives.

""Automakers have already invested a significant amount of money and time in developing affordable electric vehicles,"" he said, ""and we're seeing them adopted more and more throughout the United States"".

Indeed, despite the Trump administration’s rollback of the tax credits and incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act, the US power system began producing more electricity from clean energy sources than fossil fuels in March, according to data released by Ember, a think tank.

That trend has continued for the past three months.

Stalling the energy transition

But while progress may not be halted, it’s likely to see a significant slowdown, analysts said.

According to data from E2, a US-based group of business leaders and investors, $14 billion in clean energy projects supporting 10,000 jobs have been cancelled or postponed so far this year.

But this is where individual states can make a difference, Caroline Spears told RTÉ News.

""They can set renewable portfolio standards, for example,"" she said, ""they can create permitting and leasing offices and make it easier to get projects off the ground"".

And beyond supporting clean power generation, local governments had a variety of strategies to tackle climate change, she said.

""The biggest source of pollution in the country is increasingly transportation,"" she said.

""There's a lot that states can do on electric vehicles and on public transport,"" she said, ""and we're seeing progress and movement there as well"".

Court battles

As with President Trump’s trade tariffs, the US courts have become a major climate battleground too.

In what law professor Anthony Moffa called an ""unprecedented move"", the administration has thrown its weight behind lawsuits brought by fossil fuel companies against state climate policies.

The department of justice, for example, sued New York and Vermont over their climate ""superfund"" laws that would force oil and gas companies to pay into a state fund for clean infrastructure projects.

But similarly, climate campaigners are also using the courts to challenge government policies.

A group of 22 young activists filed a lawsuit in Montana this week arguing that President Trump’s executive orders suppressed climate science and slowed the transition to renewable energy sources in favour of fossil fuels, ""thereby worsening the air pollution and climate conditions that immediately harm and endanger Plaintiffs’ lives and personal security"".

The spokesperson for the plaintiffs 19-year-old Eva Lighthiser said in a statement that the president’s fossil fuel directives were ""a death sentence for my generation"".

""I'm not suing because I want to, I'm suing because I have to,"" she said.

""My health, my future, and my right to speak the truth are all on the line. [President Trump] is waging war on us with fossil fuels as his weapon, and we're fighting back with the Constitution,"" she said.

Earlier this month, 17 states and Washington DC sued the government over its ban on wind power projects. The White House accused the attorneys general of the states of using ""lawfare"" to thwart President Trump’s agenda.

'Spherically senseless'

But whatever the final legal outcome of the various cases before the courts, cuts to climate research have already caused ""an enormous amount of damage,"" that will outlast this administration, according to John Holdren.

The National Science Foundation, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Department of Energy's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy have all seen their budgets slashed, he said.

Key offices that are responsible for climate change monitoring, maintaining the nation's databases related to climate change and for a large fraction of climate education in US schools, colleges and universities have been closed.

Research programs cannot be revived overnight, he said, noting that staff who have been fired may have moved on to other jobs of even other countries.

That early research was the ""seed corn"" from which future practical advances grew, he added.

""When you cut that off, you're basically killing the future of innovation in all these domains, in terms of environmental and public health and in solutions for climate change,"" he said.

This was ""absolutely a case of shooting the country in the foot,"" he told RTÉ News.

""It is what the energy analyst Amory Lovins once called 'spherically senseless,’"" he said.

It’s occurring as the Trump administration pursues the maximization of already record-high oil and gas output while dismantling swaths of Biden’s policies on climate and clean energy.

The Office of Clean Energy Demonstration awards for carbon capture and storage and other technologies the department axed include nearly $332 million to a project at Exxon Mobil’s XOM.N Baytown, Texas refinery complex, $500 million to Heidelberg Materials, US in Louisiana, and $375 million to Eastman Chemical Company EMN.N in Longview, Texas.

The Baytown award was meant to cut carbon emissions by enabling the use of hydrogen instead of natural gas for the production of ethylene, a feedstock used in producing textiles and plastic resins.

The department said nearly 70% of the awards had been signed between the November 5, 2024, election day and January 20, Biden’s last day in office.

The companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Carbon capture projects aim to help curb climate change by removing the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide directly from the air or from the pollution streams of facilities, including refineries and plants that burn coal and make ethanol, for storage underground. Sometimes the gas is injected into aging oil fields to push out remaining crude.

Environmental groups focused on energy decried the cuts. Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, said the move was short-sighted and could stifle innovation.

“Locking domestic plants into outdated technology is not a recipe for future competitiveness or bringing manufacturing jobs back to American communities,” Nadel said.

The grants, largely awarded during former President Joe Biden's final few months in the White House, were primarily for programs to capture carbon emissions and store them underground.
Sublime Systems, which lost an $87 million grant, was “surprised and disappointed,” the company said in a statement.
Moreover, the announcement marks the latest of the administration's attacks on clean energy, broadly, and its effort to slash federal support for projects addressing climate change.
“Killing these projects means more emissions, more pollution, and more people getting sick,” he said.","WASHINGTON — Energy Secretary Chris Wright said Friday he canceled nearly $4 billion in project grants, in another massive blow to clean energy and greenhouse gas emissions reduction efforts in the U.S. under President Donald Trump's administration.

The grants, largely awarded during former President Joe Biden's final few months in the White House, were primarily for programs to capture carbon emissions and store them underground. Other targeted efforts span cleaner cement, natural gas and more.

Some of the 24 canceled awards include $500 million to Heidelberg Materials US, Inc.; $375 million to Eastman Chemical Company; $95 million to Nevada Gold Mines, LLC; and $270 million to Sutter CCUS, among others, according to a list provided by the Department of Energy. Sublime Systems, which lost an $87 million grant, was “surprised and disappointed,” the company said in a statement.

“Today’s action is bad for U.S. competitiveness in the global market and also directly contradictory to the administration’s stated goals of supporting energy production and environmental innovation,” said Conrad Schneider, a senior director at the Clean Air Task Force. It “undercuts U.S. competitiveness at a time when there is a growing global market for cleaner industrial products and technologies.”

The news was a swift follow-up to plans the Energy Department announced earlier this month to review 179 funded projects, totaling over $15 billion, that were awarded by the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations created under the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law.

It is part of Wright's pledge to ensure “responsible” spending — aligning with the government's broader efficiency and cost-cutting measures, such as those recommended by the Department of Government Efficiency, which has significantly impacted federal research, workers and agencies.

“While the previous administration failed to conduct a thorough financial review before signing away billions of taxpayer dollars, the Trump administration is doing our due diligence to ensure we are utilizing taxpayer dollars to strengthen our national security, bolster affordable, reliable energy sources and advance projects that generate the highest possible return on investment,"" Wright said in Friday's statement.

Moreover, the announcement marks the latest of the administration's attacks on clean energy, broadly, and its effort to slash federal support for projects addressing climate change.

The Trump administration has taken an ax to Biden-era environmental ambitions, rolled back landmark regulations, withdrawn climate project funding, and instead bolstered support for oil and gas production in the name of an “American energy dominance” agenda.

Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, called the news “shortsighted.”

Carbon capture has been a controversial climate solution, as skeptics say it enables the continued burning of fossil fuels oil, coal and natural gas that emit planet-warming greenhouse gases — including carbon dioxide — and distracts from the need to cut ties with those energy sources altogether. Though investment in the technology has grown, it also remains challenging to scale.

Industry decries the news

Organizations quickly decried the secretary's actions, stressing that the cancelations don't align with the administration's goals to bolster domestic manufacturing or energy independence.

Jessie Stolark, the executive director of the nonpartisan Carbon Capture Coalition, said the news “is a major step backward"" for carbon management technologies, which are “crucial to meeting America’s growing demand for affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy.”

“These projects are not just reducing pollution, they are keeping the U.S. on the cutting edge of manufacturing technology,"" said Mike Williams, senior fellow on the energy and environment team at public policy and advocacy group the Center for American Progress. ""Canceling these important projects will raise energy prices for consumers and sacrifice thousands of high-quality union jobs, all because the president wants to curry favor with Big Oil.”

Evan Gillespie, partner at decarbonization organization, Industrious Labs, said the move dismantles the economy and the future of American manufacturing and its workforce.

The tunnel was proposed in 2018 at a cost of $500 million but has been bogged down by legal challenges.
With that permit in hand, Enbridge would only need permission from the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy before it could begin constructing the tunnel.
Gretchen Whitmer are trying to win court rulings that would force Enbridge to remove the existing pipeline from the straits for good.
Concerns about the aging pipeline rupturing and causing a potentially disastrous spill in the straits have been building over the last decade.","Building an underground tunnel for an aging Enbridge oil pipeline that stretches across a Great Lakes channel could destroy wetlands and harm bat habitats but would eliminate the chances of a boat anchor rupturing the line and causing a catastrophic spill, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers said Friday in a long-awaited draft analysis of the proposed project's environmental impacts.

The analysis moves the corps a step closer to approving the tunnel for Line 5 in the Straits of Mackinac. The tunnel was proposed in 2018 at a cost of $500 million but has been bogged down by legal challenges. The corps fast-tracked the project in April after President Donald Trump ordered federal agencies in January to identify energy projects for expedited emergency permitting.

A final environmental assessment is expected by autumn, with a permitting decision to follow later this year. The agency initially planned to issue a permitting decision in early 2026.

With that permit in hand, Enbridge would only need permission from the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy before it could begin constructing the tunnel. That's far from a given, though.

Environmentalists have been pressuring the state to deny the permit. Meanwhile, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel and Gov. Gretchen Whitmer are trying to win court rulings that would force Enbridge to remove the existing pipeline from the straits for good.

Construction could have major short-term, long-term impacts

The analysis notes that the tunnel would eliminate the risk of a boat anchor rupturing the pipeline and causing a spill in the straits, a key concern for environmentalists. But the construction would have sweeping effects on everything from recreation to wildlife.

Many of the impacts, such as noise, vistas marred by 400-foot (121-meter) cranes, construction lights degrading stargazing opportunities at Headlands International Dark Sky Park and vibrations that would disturb aquatic wildlife would end when the work is completed, the report found.

Other impacts would last longer, including the loss of wetlands and vegetation on both sides of the strait that connects Lake Huron and Lake Michigan, and the loss of nearly 300 trees that the northern long-eared bat and tricolored bat use to roost. Grading and excavation also could disturb or destroy archaeological sites.

The tunnel-boring machine could cause vibrations that could shift the area's geology. Soil in the construction area could become contaminated and nearly 200 truck trips daily during the six-year construction period would degrade area roads, the analysis found. Gas mixing with water seeping into the tunnel could result in an explosion, but the analysis notes that Enbridge plans to install fans to properly ventilate the tunnel during excavation.

Enbridge has pledged to comply with all safety standards, replant vegetation where possible and contain erosion, the analysis noted. The company also has said it would try to limit the loudest work to daytime hours as much as possible, and offset harm to wetlands and protected species by buying credits through mitigation banks. That money can then be used to fund restoration in other areas.

“Our goal is to have the smallest possible environmental footprint,” Enbridge officials said in a statement.

The Sierra Club issued a statement Friday saying the tunnel remains “an existential threat.”

“Chances of an oil spill in the Great Lakes — our most valuable freshwater resource — skyrockets if this tunnel is built in the Straits,” the group said. “We can't drink oil. We can't fish or swim in oil.”

Julie Goodwin, a senior attorney with Earthjustice, an environmental law group that opposes the project, said the corps failed to consider the impacts of a spill that could still happen on either side of the straits or stopping the flow of oil through the Great Lakes.

“My key takeaways are the Army corps has put blinders are in service to Enbridge and President Trump's fossil fuel agenda,"" she said.

Tunnel would protect portion of Line 5 running through straits

Enbridge has been using the Line 5 pipeline to transport crude oil and natural gas liquids between Superior, Wisconsin, and Sarnia, Ontario, since 1953. Roughly 4 miles (6 kilometers) of the pipeline runs along the bottom of the Straits of Mackinac.

Concerns about the aging pipeline rupturing and causing a potentially disastrous spill in the straits have been building over the last decade. Those fears intensified in 2018 when an anchor damaged the line.

Enbridge contends that the line remains structurally sound, but it struck a deal with then-Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder's administration in 2018 that calls for the company to replace the straits portion of the line with a new section that would be encased in a protective underground tunnel.

Enbridge and environmentalists spar in court battles

Environmentalists, Native American tribes and Democrats have been fighting in court for years to stop the tunnel and force Enbridge to remove the existing pipeline from the straits. They've had little success so far.

A Michigan appellate court in February validated the state Public Service Commission's permits for the tunnel. Nessel sued in 2019 seeking to void the easement that allows Line 5 to run through the straits. That case is still pending. Whitmer revoked the easement in 2020, but Enbridge challenged that decision and a federal appellate court in April ruled that the case can proceed.

Another legal fight over Line 5 in Wisconsin

About 12 miles (19 kilometers) of Line 5 runs across the Bad River Band of Lake Superior Chippewa’s reservation in northern Wisconsin. That tribe sued in 2019 to force Enbridge to remove the line from the reservation, arguing it’s prone to spilling and that easements allowing it to operate on the reservation expired in 2013.

Enbridge has proposed a 41-mile (66-kilometer) reroute around the reservation. The tribe has filed a lawsuit seeking to void state construction permits for the project and has joined several other groups in challenging the permits through the state's contested case process.",https://wsbt.com/resources/media2/16x9/2592/986/204x0/90/32db3eb1-dbaa-4c9b-ae41-edc65ba460a4-AP25150555797830.jpg,N,,2025-06-01 10:06:58.253988

Also according to the KED report, GM primary battery supplier LG Energy Solution will make room for LFP battery manufacturing in sections of its two Ohio and Tennessee facilities.
It has already said that the back-from-the-dead Chevrolet Bolt EV will get LFP battery packs, as will at least one variant of the Silverado EV.","Once upon a time, the first automobiles, which were referred to at the time as horseless carriages, used internal-combustion engines, but electrically powered automobiles soon became popular in many urban areeas, especially in New York City, and by 1900, accounted for about one-third of all motorized vehicles on the road in the United Staters. These early EVs cost more than gasoline-powered automobiles and had far less range. In addition, they had limited range, with the Electrobat at the bottom of the rankings with 25 miles (40 km), while Standard Electric and Fritchle Electric boasted their vehicles could attain ranges between 80 and 110 miles (129 to 178 km). As a result, in the alternate history universe of „The Two Georges,“ in which the United States never seceded from the British Empire and America got a royal visit from Charles III as one of the other consequences of that, the electric auto became dominant chiefly in the east and northeast, where ample industrial electricity was available, while the steam car was preferred across the rest of the continent.

Plus ça change…

In the 1990s, the first mass-produced, purpose-designed electric vehicle from a major automaker, the General Motors EV-1, was able to travel 55 miles (89 km) on lead–acid battery packs while it could go 105 miles (169 km) on nickel-metal hydride batteries.

Today, the current range champion is the 2025 Lucent Air Grand Touring, which can run 516 miles (830 km) on a full charge. That vehicle has a manufacturer’s suggested list price, or MSRP, of $110,900. By comparison, the 2025 Toyota Corolla Hybrid can travel at least 516 miles on a tankful of petrol, while its MSRP is $23,585. A car buyer can purchase almost five of the Toyotas for what one Lucid Air Grand Touring would cost.

This notwithstanding, when General Motors announced that it had cracked the chemistry of lower-cost, energy-dense electric vehicle batteries just two weeks ago, many groups— from other automakers to clean-energy advocates in the United States to automobile buyers who wanted an EV but felt the “tax they would have to pay for the privilege wasn’t worth the price of tea leaes in Boston Harbor“—held their collective breath.

Please keep your eye on the bouncing battery and remember that current GM truck and SUV batteries use nickel-manganese-cobalt-aluminum, while entry-level variants of the Tesla Model 3 and Model Y as well as the Ford Mustang Mach E use LFP battery packs.

It was just two weeks ago that the General said that it will begin to use lithium manganese-rich, or LMR, battery cells to power its largest electric vehicles, the SUVs and full-size trucks sold by Chevrolet, GMC, and Cadillac. Ultium Cells, GM’s joint-venture battery company with LG Energy Solutions, would begin pilot production of the cells in 2027, with full production slated to be conducted at a site not yet disclosed.

LMR batteries use significantly less nickel and cobalt, substituting more manganese, which is far less expensive that copper or cobalt and far more abundant, than do other types of vehicle batteries.

Few expected the other shoe to drop so quickly, and y’all better get out of the way, as even more shoes may be dropping soon enough, more than in a grim Grimm’s Fairy Tale, if this week’s news is only the beginning.

In an entry that most certainly falls into the “But wait! There’s more!” category, the Korean Economic Daily reported on Tuesday that the General’s two main battery suppliers are indeed planning to bring LFP battery production to the home of baseball, hot dogs, apple pie, and Chevrolet.

But wait, what about the General’s plans to produce LMR battery cells in partnership with GM Ultium partner LG Energy Solutions? Let’s not complicate things with the facts, especially because the vehicles the LMR batteries are destined to go into are larger, heavier, and at the upper-end of what remains of the once elegant GM pecking order that ran Chevrolet, Pontiac, Oldsmobile, Buick, and Cadillac.

Now, back to the LFP announcement. If the timing remains in their favor, the GM partnership LFP plants will be among the first of their kind to open in the United States, as it seems unlikely at this point that Ford’s CATL-backed LFP battery production plant will in fact open next year as originally had been planned.

The Samsung SDI/GM joint venture plant in New Carlisle, Indiana is slated to start manufacturing prismatic cells by early 2027—but again under the “But Wait! There’s more!” subheading, Samsung SDI has already indicated it will refrofit part of the plant to turn out LFP cells, and the company is hot on the trail of the required raw materials and the necessary production equpment.

Also according to the KED report, GM primary battery supplier LG Energy Solution will make room for LFP battery manufacturing in sections of its two Ohio and Tennessee facilities.

For what it’s worth, the General has been mum on much about these plans. It has already said that the back-from-the-dead Chevrolet Bolt EV will get LFP battery packs, as will at least one variant of the Silverado EV. We’ll need to get Ron “Ronco” Popeil to fill us in on that in the near future.

Confused? So are we, but here’s the old lady who lives in a shoe to comment on the news…

Hawaii Gov. Josh Green signed Act 96 into law Tuesday, effectively approving a tax — also known as the “Green Fee” — which is the first of its kind in the nation.

“I hope the world is watching because having something that is a balance between industry and environment is gonna be the way to go forward to protect our people […],” Green said. “And most importantly, to protect the lifestyles and the lives we want our children to have for generations to come.”

The law now increases the the state’s Transient Accommodation Tax (TAT) by .75%, to 11%. This fee will be applied to costs for tourism-related activities including hotels and cruise ships that dock in Hawaii.

To break that down, for every $400 spent, $3 will go towards natural resource protection.

The bill is projected to raise an estimated $100 million a year to address what the state says is about half a billion dollars in critical funding needed to protect Hawaii’s environment.

“The visitor industry will struggle if we do not take action now,” said State Rep. Adrian Tam, chair of the House Committee on Tourism.

Unlike other state programs, the money generated won’t go into a dedicated special fund. Instead, the legislature will reevaluate priorities each year to decide where the money should go based on the greatest environmental need.

The areas of priority are protecting land and aquatic resources, climate and hazard resiliency and sustainable tourism.

The Grassroots Institute of Hawaiʻi, a longtime opponent of the bill, argues that it could end up hurting more than it helps.

“There’s nothing like a Hawaiʻi vacation and that is 100% true. But that doesn’t mean that it won’t affect visitor spending and the attractiveness of the Hawaiʻi as a destination,” said Malia Hill, policy director at the Grassroots Institute of Hawaiʻi.

They argue the fee won’t just fall on tourists, it will also impact local residents and small businesses.

“We travel interisland, for work, to see family, to see friends. So it is a tax on locals, and you cannot get away from that,” Hill said.

Most of the electricity in India, the world's most populous nation, still comes from coal, one of the dirtiest forms of energy. But coal's dominance is dropping, going from 60% of installed power capacity 11 years ago to less than 50% today, according to India's power ministry.

At the same time, India had its largest ever addition of clean power in the fiscal year between April 2024 and April of this year, adding 30 gigawatts — enough to power nearly 18 million Indian homes.

With a growing middle class and skyrocketing energy needs, how fast India can move away from coal and other fossil fuels, such as gasoline and oil, could have a large impact on global efforts to confront climate change.

Here is a snapshot of India's clean energy transition and some of the challenges.

Solar is now half the cost of power from new coal-powered plants. Availability of cheap components and many sunny days each year in India are some reasons experts say installed solar power increased 30 times in the last decade.

“Solar power is the cheapest it's ever been,” said Ruchita Shah, an energy analyst at climate think-tank Ember. Shah added that dropping costs for energy storage, in the form of batteries, means that renewable power will be the “new normal,"" even when the sun doesn't shine or the wind doesn't blow.

India has nearly 170 gigawatts of renewable energy projects in the pipeline, which are expected to be completed in the next few years.

“I have no doubt that India will reach its target of 500 gigawatts by 2030,” said Raghav Pachouri, an energy expert at Vasudha Foundation, a New Delhi-based think-tank.

Experts say the growth in renewables is being spurred by India's plans to add approximately 50 gigawatts of non-fossil fuel power capacity every year for the next five years and for clean power to provide 50% of the nation’s energy by the decade. When burned, fossil fuels let off greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, the main driver of climate change.

A 2022 law that made electricity cheaper for companies choosing to buy clean power, the federal government's recommendation that state utilities buy more renewable power and a 2023 government plan to invest $452 million have all catalyzed investments in renewables.

India has the fourth highest amount of clean power installed in the world and government officials said $81 billion has been invested in the renewable energy sector in the last decade. Multiple large-scale renewable power projects have begun operations or are under construction, including one of the world’s largest wind and solar power farms.

“We’ve seen domestic manufacturing capacity, at least when it comes to modules for solar panels, increasing,” said Madhura Joshi, a senior energy analyst at the European think-tank E3G.

Despite the rapid growth, challenges persist. While non-fossil fuel sources now comprise 45% of India’s total installed capacity, their share in actual electricity generation stood at 24% last year. Coal remains the dominant source, accounting for 75% of electricity generation.

The share of solar, wind, small hydro power and biomass in India's electricity generation mix stood at 12%, double what it was in 2014 but still lower than expectations by this time, according to a report by New Delhi-based think-tank, the Centre for Science and Environment.

Installed capacity is growing, but power generation from renewables needs to be optimized and integrated effectively into the grid, the report found.

A recent report by the nonprofit clean energy think-tank, RMI, found that electricity demand is expected to triple by 2050 — driven by more electric vehicles, air conditioners and industrial growth.

Acquiring land for clean energy projects remains a challenge. India also needs to rapidly build robust electricity transmission infrastructure and energy storage facilities to continue increasing clean power capacity.

“India is expected to become the world's third-largest economy in a few years, and I think we will need to adopt renewable energy to do this. There is no option for us because fossil fuels can’t keep pace"" with energy needs, said Deepak Thakur, chief executive officer of Mumbai-based renewable energy company, Mahindra Susten.

Canadian wildfire smoke has reached Illinois as of Friday, May 30, 2025.

Currently, smoke models are projecting an increase in fine particulates to northern Illinois Friday afternoon that will sweep southeast through Illinois during the evening and overnight hours.

Some smoke may linger into Saturday morning with a gradual decrease from northeast Illinois towards central Illinois throughout the day.

Another round of smoke is possible just to the west of Illinois on Sunday that is being monitored closely.

AirNow NowCast AQI may show Orange or “Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups” (USG) or higher levels to indicate higher hourly periods.

The daily Air Quality Index (AQI) for Friday is currently forecasted to be in the Yellow or “Moderate” category for most Illinois sectors.

Some sectors in the Chicago area have been downgraded to a USG AQI forecast for Friday.

Residents are encouraged to monitor local air quality and air quality forecasts using the latest information on AirNow.gov.

Particulate matter, also known as particle pollution, can cause serious health problems, including asthma attacks, heart attacks, strokes, and early death. Those most at risk are people with respiratory or pulmonary disorders, as well as children and adults who are active outdoors. Sensitive individuals should follow their doctor’s advice. Some symptoms to look out for include wheezing, coughing, a fast heartbeat, tiredness, chest pain and shortness of breath. If symptoms worsen, call your physician or 911.?

Illinois Department of Public Health encourages residents to take the following actions to protect themselves when air quality is Red or “Unhealthy” AQI category:

Stay indoors and monitor your breathing, especially if you have heart or lung disease, and keep windows and doors closed.

If your air conditioner has a fresh air intake, set your system to recirculate or close the intake.

Use high efficiency filters in air conditioning systems and portable air cleaners.

Avoid activities that create more particulate matter indoors, like smoking or burning candles.

If you cannot avoid working or other outdoors activities, choose shorter or less intense activities, considering rescheduling, and take more frequent breaks.

Consider wearing a high-quality N-95 or N-100 mask while outdoors.

But their anticipated savings could shrink if Congress approves cuts to clean energy incentives in the upcoming budget.

Pennsylvania's Solar for Schools program was designed to help schools afford to switch to solar and take advantage of federal clean energy incentives approved by the Biden administration.

For the first year of the program, the state awarded $22.6 million to 74 schools statewide, 17 of which are in Western Pennsylvania. Energy bills are a big share of a school's expenses, but the upfront cost of installing solar panels can be prohibitive.

Clairton City School District is getting $361,990 to install rooftop solar panels. The nonprofit Pennsylvania Solar Center, which is helping the district navigate the process, estimates Clairton could save 45% — or $35,000 — on its annual energy bills with the planned 393 kilowatt solar array.

""This will allow us to put money directly into classrooms, helping us improve academic programs, increasing our student attendance, and building a stronger school culture,"" said Clairton Superintendent Tamara Allen-Thomas during a news conference Thursday.

She added the project will also lower emissions from energy use and create local clean energy jobs.

""It's good for our kids, good for our economy, and good for our planet,"" Allen-Thomas said.

Clairton and other Mon Valley communities are burdened by high pollution levels from nearby heavy industry, including U.S. Steel's Clairton Coke Works. The plant is the largest producer of high-grade coke used for steelmaking in the Western Hemisphere and the largest single source of hydrogen sulfide emissions in the state.

Through lowered bills and federal clean energy tax credits, Clairton School District could save $1.5 million over the next three decades, according to Sharon Pillar, executive director of the Pennsylvania Solar Center.

But that figure is at risk.

""Without the federal benefits — which Congress is now considering abruptly ending at the end of this year — it could reduce the savings in Clairton and other schools by almost a third,"" Pillar said.

Last week, the Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives passed a spending plan that would phase out clean energy tax credits ahead of the schedule set in the Inflation Reduction Act.

Though public schools are not eligible for tax credits in the same way as a business or individual, schools can still benefit from an ""elective pay option,"" which allows them to get a direct payment from the government for the value of the credit.

The budget bill is now before the U.S. Senate.

U.S. Rep. Summer Lee (D-Pa.), whose 12th congressional district covers Clairton, said programs like Solar for Schools and federal incentives allow schools to reinvest savings in academics, as well as safeguard students' health.

Most of the electricity in India, the world’s most populous nation, still comes from coal, one of the dirtiest forms of energy. But coal’s dominance is dropping, going from 60% of installed power capacity 11 years ago to less than 50% today, according to India’s power ministry.

At the same time, India had its largest ever addition of clean power in the fiscal year between April 2024 and April of this year, adding 30 gigawatts — enough to power nearly 18 million Indian homes.

With a growing middle class and skyrocketing energy needs, how fast India can move away from coal and other fossil fuels, such as gasoline and oil, could have a large impact on global efforts to confront climate change.

Second, the D. C. Circuit ordered the Board to address the environmental effects of projects separate in time or place from the construction and operation of the railroad line.

The NEPA is an environmental impact review statute that was promulgated in the 1970s, along with a slew of other environmental protection statutes like the Clean Air Act of 1972 and the Endangered Species Act of 1973. Unlike these two statutes, the NEPA is procedural. The statute merely requires an agency to produce an environmental impact statement (EIS) that must address the significant environmental effects of a proposed project and propose alternative measures to mitigate these effects. There is no particular way the statute says that an agency must review the environmental impacts, that discretion in manner is left to the agencies to do as they see fit.

The Supreme Court in this case was asked to review a lower court decision from the US Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, which found that the US Surface Transportation Board (Board) did not produce an EIS that sufficiently analyzed all of the potential environmental effects of a project proposed by seven Utah counties. The proposed project concerned the construction and operation of an approximately 88-mile railroad line in northeastern Utah that would connect Utah’s oil-rich Uinta Basin to the national rail network.

The lower court specifically stated that the Board did not analyze the potential upstream and downstream effects of the oil drilling in the Basin. The court reversed this notion in a majority decision. Justice Kavanaugh, in the majority opinion joined by the four other conservative members of the Court, stated that:

First, the D. C. Circuit did not afford the Board the substantial judicial deference required in NEPA cases. Second, the D. C. Circuit ordered the Board to address the environmental effects of projects separate in time or place from the construction and operation of the railroad line. But NEPA requires agencies to focus on the environmental effects of the project at issue. Under NEPA, the Board’s EIS did not need to address the environmental effects of upstream oil drilling or downstream oil refining. Rather, it needed to address only the effects of the 88-mile railroad line. And the Board’s EIS did so.

Justice Kavanaugh continued by rejecting the petitioners’ attempt to use the NEPA as a way to air their policy disagreements with the construction of the proposed railroad. He concluded the opinion by stating, “[c]itizens may not enlist the federal courts, ‘under the guise of judicial review’ of agency compliance with NEPA, to delay or block agency projects based on the environmental effects of other projects separate from the project at hand.” The three liberal justices stated in a concurring opinion written by Justice Sotomayor agreed with the approval of the project, but stated that they would have taken a narrower path grounded in case precedent.",https://www.jurist.org/news/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/05/Mining_gilsonite_Cowboy_Dike_north_of_Bonanza_Utah_USA_4.jpg,N,,2025-05-31 23:01:15.558979

Will it work out this time? - The Times,"Ben Spencer, Science Editor",,,,,https://www.thetimes.com/business-money/energy/article/british-nuclear-energy-what-went-wrong-future-wx2qtxqnd,"Why, one wonders, is it so fiendishly difficult to build nuclear power stations in this country?
The world’s first commercial nuclear power station, Calder Hall, opened at Sellafield in Cumbria in 1956.
Because ‘nuclear power, no thanks’ today means ‘climate change, no doubt’ tomorrow.” Similar conversions are taking place across the globe, with once-bitter opponents of nuclear power now advocating for it.
The technology’s backers point out that, despite a handful of high-profile disasters, fewer deaths are linked to nuclear power than wind power.
At Sellafield, the birthplace of British nuclear power, Tim Gregory believes such challenges can and must be overcome.","Yet only one of those stations was ever built: Sizewell B on the Suffolk coast. It was switched on in 1995. Britain hasn’t completed a station since.

This failure is not down to a lack of ambition. Thirty years after the hubris of Howell, Ed Miliband, during his first stint as energy secretary, again announced ten new power stations. When he re-entered the energy department last summer, another 15 years later, construction had started on only one: Hinkley Point C.

Overbudget and overschedule, the Somerset station is now expected to be completed in 2031. With an estimated final price tag of £46 billion, it will be the most expensive power project the world has seen.

On June 11, Milliband will confirm £2.7 billion of funding for Sizewell C, in Suffolk, where ground preparation has begun. He will also announce a new generation of small modular reactors (SMRs) — factory-built miniature nuclear power generators that are seen by many as the future of the sector.

SMRs will cost a fraction of the price and take a fraction of the time to build, and by the early 2030s will be sending vital power into our homes … in theory. Nobody in Britain, or indeed anywhere else, has even built a prototype SMR.

Why, one wonders, is it so fiendishly difficult to build nuclear power stations in this country? With the sector’s questionable safety record and such eye-watering costs, to be met through our energy bills, do we even need new nuclear power?

Out of energy

In the five decades between Howell and Miliband, nuclear has been widely viewed as a silver bullet to solve Britain’s energy conundrum. Backers say it will underpin intermittent wind and solar and diminish our dependency on petrostates such as Saudi Arabia or Russia.

At one point, Britain led the way when it came to nuclear power. The world’s first commercial nuclear power station, Calder Hall, opened at Sellafield in Cumbria in 1956. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, new stations sprang up from Dungeness to Torness, Anglesey to Hartlepool. For decades, those stations provided the baseload that underpinned Britain’s power system.

In 1997, there were 17 stations in operation, providing 27 per cent of the UK’s electricity. But when cheap gas was discovered in the North Sea, triggering the 1990s “dash for gas”, the newly privatised energy sector all but gave up on nuclear. Today only five of our ageing nuclear power stations are still operating in Britain — and four of them are scheduled to close by 2030, having already had their lifespans extended.

The 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan contributed to the slowdown — not only in the UK but worldwide — adding to lingering fears from the 1979 Three Mile Island meltdown in the US and 1986 Chernobyl catastrophe in Ukraine. Environmentalists in the past have viewed nuclear power as not only dangerous and expensive but also potentially polluting — the half-life of uranium-235, the fuel used in most reactors, is 700 million years, and nobody has yet figured out how to safely store it.

Undeterred by such niggles, Miliband is now preparing to relaunch our nuclear sector once again, saying: “We are shaking up the planning rules to make it easier to build nuclear power stations of all types across the country, ending the status quo and building a nuclear resurgence here in Britain.”

‘The penny is dropping’

We have heard such rhetoric before. This time, however, experts say politicians are acting with a new sense of urgency.

“It’s just dawning on us what it will take to seriously electrify society,” says Tim Gregory, a nuclear chemist at Sellafield and the author of Going Nuclear: How the Atom Will Save the World. “Electric cars, electric heating systems, artificial intelligence — these all use an enormous amount of electricity.”

For advocates of nuclear, the drive to net-zero carbon emissions makes acceleration all the more important. Last year, Britain’s last coal-fired power station closed in the name of lower emissions. By the end of the decade, Labour also wants to eliminate gas, which provides a third of the country’s electricity.

Wind and solar power are being rolled out at speed, but when the wind doesn’t blow and the sun doesn’t shine, without fossil fuels to fill the gap, blackouts will be a serious threat.

“How do you make those enormous quantities of electricity and achieve net zero at the same time?” Gregory asks. “The penny is dropping: nuclear is a really obvious answer to that.”

Critics in Westminster whisper that Miliband is so wedded to renewables that he does not take nuclear seriously. They point to a left-wing tradition, epitomised by his activist parents Ralph and Marion, that they say puts the energy secretary closer to the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament than to Great British Nuclear.

His allies, however, say Miliband’s green conviction is precisely why he is so determined to revive nuclear power.

Miliband explained his reasoning in a 2009 speech to the TUC, saying: “I have to confess to you that I did not grow up in a pro-nuclear family, but the truth is that climate change should change everyone’s view about nuclear power. Because ‘nuclear power, no thanks’ today means ‘climate change, no doubt’ tomorrow.”

Similar conversions are taking place across the globe, with once-bitter opponents of nuclear power now advocating for it. In most cases it is not climate change but trade wars and actual wars that are driving a flight to self-sufficiency.

China steaming ahead

“In the post-Ukraine, post-Covid era, where we’ve seen energy prices spike and a lot more political instability, there’s a new desire to create energy independence from the outside world,” says Andy Champ, who leads the UK nuclear programme of GE Hitachi, an American-Japanese conglomerate hoping to build Britain’s SMRs.

Many countries are attempting to restart stalled sectors. Since the 1990s, nuclear construction has ground virtually to a halt across the West. France — whose 57 reactors generate 65 per cent of its power, the legacy of a 1970s building spree — last year completed its first new station in 25 years.

In 2023 and 2024, the US built its first new units since 1996, with such steep overruns that the manufacturer, Westinghouse, filed for bankruptcy midway through construction.

But the fears of the past are giving way to a new pragmatism. The technology’s backers point out that, despite a handful of high-profile disasters, fewer deaths are linked to nuclear power than wind power.

Germany, which closed its nuclear programme in the wake of Fukushima, last month ended its long-standing opposition to new European nuclear projects. Denmark, which banned nuclear power in 1985, is also reconsidering its position. Even Japan, which closed most of its reactors after the 2011 disaster, is looking to reopen old stations in a bid to reduce its reliance on imported fossil fuels.

Public opposition is melting away worldwide. In America, net support for nuclear power rose from 3 per cent in 1983 to 54 per cent last year. This has coincided with a need for new power for data centres and electricity-hungry artificial intelligence.

US energy planners are keenly aware that America’s great geo-economic rival has steamed ahead. China has more nuclear power under construction than the rest of the world combined. Since 2020 it has started work on 22 new reactors. South Korea is not only building steadily but also exporting its technology, with four new plants completed in the United Arab Emirates since 2021, on time and on budget.

Thinking small may help

There is now an opportunity for Britain to recover momentum. Sizewell C is designed as a replica of Hinkley Point C. But industry insiders say ministers need to act quickly to take advantage of lessons from Somerset.

There are 12,000 people working at Hinkley and another 14,000 people employed across the UK providing services and expertise for the project. Recruiting and training them was expensive and time-consuming. If Sizewell can get going soon, a large bulk of the workforce could, in theory, transfer straight from Somerset to Suffolk. But if there are more delays, they are likely to seek employment in other sectors or overseas.

Finance is another challenge. When work started in 2017, Hinkley Point C was budgeted as a £17 billion project. It will end up costing nearly three times as much.

“The old school of thought was that economies of scale come through building big,” says Champ, who worked for the British government before moving to GE Hitachi. “But you’ve now got to find £40 billion-plus to build one of these things, and you’ve got to wait ten years-plus before you start getting any payback on your loan.”

SMRs could solve this headache. Each of these modules generates roughly 300 megawatts — about a fifth of the output of each of the two giant 1.63 gigawatt reactors at Hinkley Point C. They also take up much less space: one could easily fit on two football pitches, while the Hinkley site covers the equivalent of 245.

Next week Great British Nuclear will announce the winner of a competition to build the UK’s first SMRs, which will also be the world’s first if they get a move on. Four companies are in the running: GE Hitachi, Rolls-Royce, Holtec and a restructured Westinghouse.

Although some politicians talk whimsically of having one of these reactors on every street corner, Champ says this is unlikely to happen, at least in the short term.

Initially, the plan is to build SMRs on existing or decommissioned nuclear sites. Although no location has been confirmed, last year Great British Nuclear bought the former nuclear sites of Wylfa, on Anglesey, and Oldbury, Gloucestershire, both of which have been talked about as SMR sites. Engineers envisage as many as ten SMRs would be built on a single site, creating a station with a total output similar to Hinkley’s.

The key advantage is the financing. SMRs are expected to cost about £3 billion each, less than a tenth of the cost of a full nuclear station. But Champ says: “You’re not going to get the efficiencies [building] just two or three or four. You need to start building 10, 20, 30 of these to really see the advantages.”

If a fleet of miniature nuclear stations does spring up across Britain, a key challenge remains: what to do with the spent fuel and other radioactive waste. Nuclear Waste Services, which is owned by the government, is trying to find a site to dig a huge underground cavern — a “geological waste-disposal” facility — in which to bury radioactive material.

Three potential sites have been identified: two in Cumbria and one in Lincolnshire. But even if locals agree to the proposals, it will be the 2050s at the very earliest before such a facility opens. The budget for such a site is estimated at up to £53 billion.

At Sellafield, the birthplace of British nuclear power, Tim Gregory believes such challenges can and must be overcome. “We’ve done it before and we can do it again,” he says. “If you solve the energy problem, then you solve the economic problem, the environmental problem, the humanitarian problem. Nuclear power can do that.”",https://www.thetimes.com/imageserver/image/%2Fbbad4058-09df-451c-aaa3-3a18a053ab93.jpg?crop=4369%2C2458%2C0%2C0&resize=1200,N,,2025-05-31 22:04:49.610572

The money comes from the Environmental Protection Agency in the form of two grants, the Assessment Grant worth $500,000 and the Cleanup Grant worth more than $713,000, Steve Gugliotta, the city’s director of community development, said.

“These funds will help address the environmental impacts of historically contaminated properties, paving the way for community revitalization and economic development. The city has been notified of the awards and is now working to submit all required documentation,” he said.

The two grants will be used for a few different projects, with the bulk of the cleanup grant going to remediate the old Knox Laundry site, he said.

The facility, which used to sit at 57 North Kellogg Street and 332 East Ferris Street, opened in 1898 as a retail laundry store which was expanded into a multi-story dry-cleaning facility, he said.

Between 2006 and 2007, the court ordered the demolition of the building after it had been vacated and condemned because of its deteriorating condition.

“Terminating the business operations and removing former structures has stopped the potential for any continuing releases of contamination into our environment,” he said. “But until the site is fully remediated, the potential for redevelopment is very limited.”

The money will help the city address remaining contamination, more specifically areas where soil has been “impacted above saturation limits,” Gugliotta said.

The Assessment Grant will be used to evaluate two different sites that have been labeled as a brownfield.

“A brownfield is a property, the expansion, redevelopment, or reuse of which may be complicated by the presence or potential presence of a hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant,” the EPA’s website said.

The first of these two brownfields is the former Broadview Hotel located at 29 Public Square, which throughout its time was home to many businesses, including a filling station which dates back to 1927, he said.

The second was the former Tucker’s Printing Company, located on North Cherry Street, which was recently demolished after it had a second fire in 2024, he said.

The site has housed industrial buildings in the past that Gugliotta says have led to environmental concerns.

With any money from these grants, they may have left over sites that will be selected by a Brownfields Inventory, which was put together in 2023 by Kansas State University’s Technical Assistance to Brownfield program, as well as consultants at Terracon, he said.

He said they are anticipating the project to run from Oct. 1, 2025, until Sept. 30, 2029, although that is just an estimate, and the projects may not take that much time.",https://www.centralillinoisproud.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/57/2019/06/cropped-CIProud_2019-1.png?strip=1,N,,2025-05-31 20:06:55.208924

“Today’s action is bad for U.S. competitiveness in the global market and also directly contradictory to the administration’s stated goals of supporting energy production and environmental innovation,” said Conrad Schneider, a senior director at the Clean Air Task Force. It “undercuts U.S. competitiveness at a time when there is a growing global market for cleaner industrial products and technologies.”

The news was a swift follow-up to plans the Energy Department announced earlier this month to review 179 funded projects, totaling over $15 billion, that were awarded by the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations created under the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law.

It is part of Wright's pledge to ensure “responsible” spending — aligning with the government's broader efficiency and cost-cutting measures, such as those recommended by the Department of Government Efficiency, which has significantly impacted federal research, workers and agencies.

“While the previous administration failed to conduct a thorough financial review before signing away billions of taxpayer dollars, the Trump administration is doing our due diligence to ensure we are utilizing taxpayer dollars to strengthen our national security, bolster affordable, reliable energy sources and advance projects that generate the highest possible return on investment,"" Wright said in Friday's statement.

Moreover, the announcement marks the latest of the administration's attacks on clean energy, broadly, and its effort to slash federal support for projects addressing climate change.

The Trump administration has taken an ax to Biden-era environmental ambitions, rolled back landmark regulations, withdrawn climate project funding, and instead bolstered support for oil and gas production in the name of an “American energy dominance” agenda.

Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, called the news “shortsighted.”

Carbon capture has been a controversial climate solution, as skeptics say it enables the continued burning of fossil fuels oil, coal and natural gas that emit planet-warming greenhouse gases — including carbon dioxide — and distracts from the need to cut ties with those energy sources altogether. Though investment in the technology has grown, it also remains challenging to scale.

Industry decries the news

Organizations quickly decried the secretary's actions, stressing that the cancelations don't align with the administration's goals to bolster domestic manufacturing or energy independence.

Jessie Stolark, the executive director of the nonpartisan Carbon Capture Coalition, said the news “is a major step backward"" for carbon management technologies, which are “crucial to meeting America’s growing demand for affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy.”

“These projects are not just reducing pollution, they are keeping the U.S. on the cutting edge of manufacturing technology,"" said Mike Williams, senior fellow on the energy and environment team at public policy and advocacy group the Center for American Progress. ""Canceling these important projects will raise energy prices for consumers and sacrifice thousands of high-quality union jobs, all because the president wants to curry favor with Big Oil.”

Evan Gillespie, partner at decarbonization organization, Industrious Labs, said the move dismantles the economy and the future of American manufacturing and its workforce.

“Killing these projects means more emissions, more pollution, and more people getting sick,” he said.",https://media.tegna-media.com/assets/CCT/images/dd4006f5-2944-4003-a4a8-ba33863cd977/20250531T152006/dd4006f5-2944-4003-a4a8-ba33863cd977_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-05-31 22:04:59.222687

The proposed legislation, dubbed the “One Big Beautiful Bill in Congress,” aims to eliminate tax credits for batteries produced using Chinese technology, directly impacting Ford’s plans to license technology from Chinese battery giant CATL for the Marshall facility. Ford Executive Chair Bill Ford emphasized the critical role of these tax credits, stating, “The production tax credit that we made the investment around, it seems to be up for grabs,” warning that their loss could “imperil” the project.

The BlueOval Battery Park, currently under construction and 60% complete, is a cornerstone of Ford’s electric vehicle (EV) strategy, with production of lithium iron phosphate batteries slated to begin in 2026. The plant is expected to create 1,700 jobs and has already prompted Ford to invest over $450,000 in local community initiatives in Calhoun County. However, the project has faced challenges, including a turbulent EV market that led Ford to scale back its initial $3.5 billion investment to $2.5–$3 billion and reduce job projections from 2,500 to 1,700. The state of Michigan also cut its incentive package from $210 million to $141 million in response to Ford’s downsizing, reflecting the project’s precarious footing amid shifting economic and policy landscapes

The potential loss of federal tax credits adds further uncertainty to the Marshall plant’s future, raising concerns about its economic viability and Ford’s broader EV ambitions. Bill Ford has called the proposed cuts unfair, arguing that changing incentives after significant investments have been made undermines business confidence. With the facility poised to bolster domestic battery production and reduce reliance on imports, its success hinges on stable policy support.

What clean energy projects have been canceled Some of the most recent cancellations include the Kore Power battery factory in Arizona and BorgWarner’s closure of two EV manufacturing sites in Michigan.
Of the projects canceled this year, most — more than $12 billion worth — came in Republican-led states and congressional districts, the analysis said.
Red districts have benefited more than blue ones from an influx of clean energy development and jobs, experts say.
Still, $4.5 billion in development was canceled or delayed last month, according to E2’s tally.","More than $14 billion in clean energy investments in the U.S. have been canceled or delayed this year, according to an analysis released Thursday, as President Donald Trump’s pending megabill has raised fears over the future of domestic battery, electric vehicle and solar and wind energy development.

Many companies are concerned that investments will be in jeopardy amid House Republicans’ passage of a tax bill that would gut clean energy credits, nonpartisan group E2 said in its analysis of projects that it and consultancy Atlas Public Policy tracked.

The groups estimate the losses since January have also cost 10,000 new clean energy jobs.

The tax credits, bolstered in the landmark climate bill passed under former President Joe Biden in 2022, are crucial for boosting renewable technologies key to the clean energy transition. E2 estimates that $132 billion in plans have been announced since the so-called Inflation Reduction Act passed, not counting the cancellations.

Last week’s House bill effectively renders moot many of the law’s incentives. Advocacy groups decried the potential impact that could have on the industry after the multitrillion-dollar tax breaks package passed.

“The House’s plan coupled with the administration’s focus on stomping out clean energy and returning us to a country powered by coal and gas guzzlers is causing businesses to cancel plans, delay their plans and take their money and jobs to other countries instead,” E2 executive director Bob Keefe said.

The Senate is now reviewing the bill with an informal July 4 deadline to get it to the president’s desk.

What clean energy projects have been canceled

Some of the most recent cancellations include the Kore Power battery factory in Arizona and BorgWarner’s closure of two EV manufacturing sites in Michigan. Bosch suspended a $200 million investment in a hydrogen fuel cell factory in South Carolina, citing changes within the market over the past year in a statement to The Associated Press.

Tariffs, inflationary pressures, nascent company struggles and low adoption rates for some technologies may also have been reasons for these companies’ plans changing. For instance, the battery storage and electric vehicle sectors have seen the most impact in 2025, with the latter especially having had had a difficult past few years. Several projects spurred by the IRA were also canceled prior to 2025.

Of the projects canceled this year, most — more than $12 billion worth — came in Republican-led states and congressional districts, the analysis said. Red districts have benefited more than blue ones from an influx of clean energy development and jobs, experts say.

Georgia and Tennessee are particularly at risk because they are highly invested in EV and battery production, said Marilyn Brown, an energy policy professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology who was not involved in the analysis.

“If all of a sudden these tax credits are removed, I’m not sure how these ongoing projects are going to continue,” said Fengqi You, an engineering professor at Cornell University who also was not involved.

A handful of Republican lawmakers have urged the continuation of energy tax credits, with some saying in an April letter to Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D. that a repeal could disrupt the American people and weaken the county’s position as a global energy leader.

The US and the global stage

The Trump administration has sought to dismantle much of Biden’s environmental and climate-related policy — what he calls the Democrats’ “green new scam” — withdrawing again from the Paris climate agreement, rolling back countless landmark pollution regulations and environmental initiatives, reconsidering scientific findings supporting climate action, blocking renewable energy sources and more in an effort to bolster a fossil fuel-led “American energy dominance” agenda.

Meanwhile other countries are proceeding with green investments. The European Parliament is committing to the European Union Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, a policy meant to prevent “carbon leakage,” or companies moving production to countries where climate policies are less strict. And the International Maritime Organization is moving toward a global carbon tax on shipping.

In a sign that not all hope is lost for the future of renewables in the U.S., April alone saw nearly $500 million in new development, with Japanese manufacturing company Hitachi’s energy arm building out transmission and electrification operations in Virginia and materials and technology company Corning investing in solar manufacturing in Michigan.

Also, we hear from Debbie Kelley, the “pollinator lady.” Hear about local efforts to restore pollinator habitats in south central Indiana.

Migrating birds are the ultimate endurance athletes. Some migratory songbirds weigh no more than a few ounces but fly nonstop across oceans to find food in the winter and nesting sites in the summer. There are more than 300 bird species – including birds of prey, songbirds, waterfowl and shorebirds – that migrate through the Midwest.

They follow the Mississippi Flyway, a superhighway in the sky that broadly traces the Mississippi River, extending north to Canada and south to Central and South America. The flyway encompasses many important Midwest habitats, including the restored bottomland forests along the lower Wabash River in southwestern Indiana and the prairies of Kankakee Sands.

During migration, birds depend on suitable habitats to rest and refuel, just as we need to rest and fill up on long hikes or road trips. North America has lost nearly 3 billion birds since 1970, much of that due to habitat loss. By helping to protect and restore vital pit stops along the flyway – in the Midwest and throughout the Americas – we are providing birds and other wildlife with a needed lifeline.

The southwest corner of Indiana, where the Wabash and Ohio rivers flow together, contains perhaps the widest array of habitats in the entire state. Here you will find cypress swamps, oak barrens and oxbow lakes in the big river floodplains, creating a home for many rare plants and animals, as well as providing critical stopover sites for migratory birds.

From a few critically endangered whooping cranes to hundreds of thousands of ducks and geese, the increasing numbers of birds delight birdwatchers, hunters and those of us who just enjoy hearing a warbler’s song outside our window. These birds, and hundreds of other species, are responding to the many conservation efforts to protect and restore area habitat. They also represent the quality of habitat that remains to be protected in southwest Indiana.

Using cutting edge mapping tools to prioritize potential restoration sites, The Nature Conservancy is transforming altered landscapes back to functioning floodplain habitat. Ultimately, greater numbers of migratory birds will utilize the area during their long journeys.

As a part of the larger Mississippi River basin, the Wabash River and its tributaries are a top conservation priority. The Nature Conservancy is focusing on water quality and quantity concerns and are working to reduce the impacts of intensive land use and address habitat loss.

Chicago, the third-largest city in the United States, now powers its more than 400 city-owned buildings – including firehouses, libraries and two major airports – using renewable energy. The shift is expected to slash the Windy City’s carbon emissions by 290,000 metric tons annually, the equivalent of the pollution from 62,000 cars. “Chicago’s efforst are a model for other state and city officials,” says EDF energy policy specialist Curt Stokes. Most of Chicago’s power comes from a massive solar array in central Illinois. Built over the last two years, the solar project created hundreds of new jobs in the state.

Part of the city’s successful transition to clean energy is owed to the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act of 2021, an Illinois law. The act aims to reduce climate pollution while creatinf a clean-energy workforce. Chicago got serious about transitioning to 100% renewable energy during the first Trump administration, when advocates began calling for local climate action in the absence of federal leadership.

“We have a responsibility to lead through climate action that benefits the people and the planer,” says Angela Tovar, Chicago’s chief sustainability officer. “By moving to renewable energy for city operations, we’re moving closer to our goal of making all energy consumed in Chicago renewable by 2035, and ultimately to a more sustainable future for all.”

A group of young people are suing the Trump Administration for prioritizing the use of fossil fuels — and driving up planet-warming emissions. The suit was filed Thursday morning in a Montana federal court. The plaintiffs are twenty-two young people from across the country – including ten of the youth plaintiffs in Montana’s climate case. The state supreme court ruled in their favor last year.

They are now suing over a suite of President Trump’s policies. That includes directives to promote fossil fuel development, exempt coal plants from having to filter toxic air pollution, stop all wind energy development, and defund scientific research on climate change. Trump says the U.S. needs to boost domestic energy production and limit regulations on the industry.

Livingston student Eva Lighthiser is the lead plaintiff- and one of the sixteen young people that sued the state of Montana. “We as young people are inheriting this future that is very uncertain and it is quite scary for us, and we are doing the best that we can to protect and preserve a safe future for ourselves. And I don’t think that’s too much to ask,” Lighthiser said.

She says the Trump administration’s actions will worsen climate change and the harms her generation faces as a result. She says these changes violate her, and the other plaintiff’s rights to life and liberty under the US Constitution. Julia Olson is one of the lawyers on the case, and the head of the nonprofit law firm Our Children’s Trust that’s brought these youth-led climate cases.

“The pollution from fossil fuels, in and of itself, is a danger, but it is truly threatening the life support system that these plaintiffs need to live and grow healthy,” Olson said. They are asking the court to block the Trump policies, and reinstate climate change information and monitoring across government sites.

For more on these credits and the documentation they require, read Tax Credits for Energy-Efficiency Home Improvement in 2025.","If you are mulling installing solar panels on your roof or making other energy-efficient improvements to your home, you may want to act quickly to take advantage of one of two federal income tax credits. First, is the residential clean energy property credit for homeowners who install a power system that uses solar or other renewable energy. Second, is the energy-efficient home improvement credit for homeowners who make smaller energy-saving purchases for their homes.

How long these two credits — which reduce the taxes you owe dollar for dollar — will remain on the books, and what, if any, changes will be made, are currently open questions. On May 22, the House passed its One Big Beautiful Bill that would extend the tax changes in the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that automatically expire at the end of 2025. The bill also provides lots of other tax breaks.

The House's One Big Beautiful Bill would also scale back many of the green energy tax credits that were created, expanded or renewed in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act., including the home energy savings tax credits. Specifically, the bill would repeal the residential clean energy property credit and the energy efficient home improvement credit, effective for property placed in service after 2025.

Now it's the Senate's turn. The odds are good that Congress will pass a tax package sometime this summer, despite a series of hurdles that lawmakers will have to overcome. However, the Senate will make some changes to the bill, including possible revisions to the green energy tax credits.

Since homeowners may claim a home energy credit only for the year the improvements are made, if you’re thinking of making any energy-saving upgrades, you’ll want to pay for them and get them completed before December 31 to ensure a tax credit. They should be claimed using IRS Form 5695.

The residential clean energy property credit

This tax break is for homeowners who install an alternative energy system that relies on a renewable energy source, such as solar, wind, geothermal, or fuel cell or battery storage technology. Think solar panels, solar-powered water heaters, geothermal heat pumps, wind turbines, fuel cells, etc. The credit equals 30% of the cost of materials and installation or systems that you install in your home. There is no maximum credit dollar limit for solar, geothermal, wind, or battery storage systems. But for fuel cells, the credit is capped at $500 for each half-kilowatt of power capacity.

Unused residential clean energy property credits can be carried forward to reduce tax owed in future years. Homeowners who install a renewable energy system sometimes qualify for a rebate. These rebates are nontaxable, but they reduce the system’s cost for figuring the credit.

The energy efficient home improvement credit

The basic credit is 30% of the cost and installation of certain types of insulation, boilers, central air-conditioning systems, water heaters, heat pumps, exterior doors and windows, etc., that you install in a home. These items must also meet certain energy-efficiency requirements, depending on the product. There is a $1,200 general aggregate yearly credit limit. But many specific upgrades have lower monetary credit limits and others have higher ones.

Here are the item-by-item yearly caps: $150 for a home-energy audit; $500 in aggregate for exterior doors (a maximum of $250 per door); $600 for exterior windows or skylights, and $600 for natural gas, propane or oil water heaters, electric panels, central air conditioners, or natural gas, propane or oil furnaces or hot water boilers. And $2,000 for biomass stoves or biomass boilers, electric or natural gas heat pump water heaters, or electric or natural gas heat pumps. Unlike the residential clean energy property credit, you cannot carry forward any unused energy-efficient home improvement credits to future years.

As an example, let’s say that in 2025, you purchase and install in your home two exterior doors at a cost of $1,000 each, windows and skylights at a total cost of $2,200, and a $6,000 central air conditioner. Your 2025 tax credit amount is $1,200. Now, change the facts. In 2025, you purchase and install in your home a natural gas heat pump that costs $7,000, a $4,000 natural gas tankless water heater, and a $6,000 central air conditioner. Your total maximum credit is $3,200: $2,000 for the heat pump. $600 for the water heater and $600 for the air conditioner.

In a major step towards promoting clean energy in India, IndianOil has finalised the Levelized Cost of Hydrogen (LCOH) for setting up a 10,000 Tonnes Per Annum Green Hydrogen Generation Unit at its Panipat Refinery & Petrochemical Complex.

This project marks IndianOil's entry into the green hydrogen sector and will be the largest green hydrogen initiative in India to date.

The company in a statement on Friday, stated that ""Slated for commissioning by December 2027, the Green Hydrogen produced will replace fossil-derived Hydrogen in refinery operations, resulting in substantial reduction in Carbon emissions"".

The plant is expected to be commissioned by December 2027. The green hydrogen produced at this facility will replace the fossil-fuel-based hydrogen currently used in the refinery's operations.

This transition is expected to significantly cut down carbon emissions, helping IndianOil move towards a more sustainable and environment-friendly model.

The company also added that this initiative is in line with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's vision under the National Green Hydrogen Mission and forms a critical part of IndianOil's larger decarbonization strategy.

The project also supports the company's Net Zero target and demonstrates its commitment to leading India's shift towards a cleaner and greener energy future.

Earlier, Arvinder Singh Sahney, Chairman of IOC, during an exclusive conversation with at the World Economic Forum 2025 in Davos, Switzerland, stated that the plant, with a production capacity of 10,000 tons per annum, had made substantial progress.

""Green hydrogen plant is now alive. We have got very good bids for it. And now the tenders are under evaluation. And within a month or so, we will be able to award the job, and within two years, that green hydrogen, the 10,000 tons per annum plant at Panipat (Haryana) will be commissioned"" he said.

The plant aims to bolster India's green energy mission, contributing to a sustainable and carbon-neutral future.

With this landmark project, IndianOil further strengthens its leadership in the country's energy transformation journey.","https://etimg.etb2bimg.com/thumb/msid-121535148,imgsize-78424,width-1200,height=765,overlay-etmanufacturing/news/energy/indianoil-finalises-indias-largest-green-hydrogen-project-at-panipat.jpg",N,,2025-05-31 22:04:39.760148

AI is eating the world—and the machines behind it are ravenous.

Each ChatGPT query, each model update, each robotic breakthrough consumes massive amounts of energy. In fact, AI is already pushing global power grids to the brink.

Wall Street is pouring hundreds of billions into artificial intelligence—training smarter chatbots, automating industries, and building the digital future. But there’s one urgent question few are asking:

Where will all of that energy come from?

AI is the most electricity-hungry technology ever invented. Each data center powering large language models like ChatGPT consumes as much energy as a small city. And it’s about to get worse.

Even Sam Altman, the founder of OpenAI, issued a stark warning:

“The future of AI depends on an energy breakthrough.”

Elon Musk was even more blunt:

“AI will run out of electricity by next year.”

As the world chases faster, smarter machines, a hidden crisis is emerging behind the scenes. Power grids are strained. Electricity prices are rising. Utilities are scrambling to expand capacity.

And that’s where the real opportunity lies…

One little-known company—almost entirely overlooked by most AI investors—could be the ultimate backdoor play. It’s not a chipmaker. It’s not a cloud platform. But it might be the most important AI stock in the US owns critical energy infrastructure assets positioned to feed the coming AI energy spike.

As demand from AI data centers explodes, this company is gearing up to profit from the most valuable commodity in the digital age: electricity.

The “Toll Booth” Operator of the AI Energy Boom

It owns critical nuclear energy infrastructure assets, positioning it at the heart of America’s next-generation power strategy.

It’s one of the only global companies capable of executing large-scale, complex EPC (engineering, procurement, and construction) projects across oil, gas, renewable fuels, and industrial infrastructure.

It plays a pivotal role in U.S. LNG exportation—a sector about to explode under President Trump’s renewed “America First” energy doctrine.

Trump has made it clear: Europe and U.S. allies must buy American LNG.

And our company sits in the toll booth—collecting fees on every drop exported.

But that’s not all…

As Trump’s proposed tariffs push American manufacturers to bring their operations back home, this company will be first in line to rebuild, retrofit, and reengineer those facilities.

AI. Energy. Tariffs. Onshoring. This One Company Ties It All Together.

While the world is distracted by flashy AI tickers, a few smart investors are quietly scooping up shares of the one company powering it all from behind the scenes.

AI needs energy. Energy needs infrastructure.

And infrastructure needs a builder with experience, scale, and execution.

This company has its finger in every pie—and Wall Street is just starting to notice.

Wall Street is noticing this company also because it is quietly riding all of these tailwinds—without the sky-high valuation.

While most energy and utility firms are buried under mountains of debt and coughing up hefty interest payments just to appease bondholders…

This company is completely debt-free.

In fact, it’s sitting on a war chest of cash—equal to nearly one-third of its entire market cap.

It also owns a huge equity stake in another red-hot AI play, giving investors indirect exposure to multiple AI growth engines without paying a premium.

And here’s what the smart money has started whispering…

The Hedge Fund Secret That’s Starting to Leak Out

This stock is so off-the-radar, so absurdly undervalued, that some of the most secretive hedge fund managers in the world have begun pitching it at closed-door investment summits.

They’re sharing it quietly, away from the cameras, to rooms full of ultra-wealthy clients.

Why? Because excluding cash and investments, this company is trading at less than 7 times earnings.

And that’s for a business tied to:

The AI infrastructure supercycle

The onshoring boom driven by Trump-era tariffs

A surge in U.S. LNG exports

And a unique footprint in nuclear energy—the future of clean, reliable power

You simply won’t find another AI and energy stock this cheap… with this much upside.

This isn’t a hype stock. It’s not riding on hope.

It’s delivering real cash flows, owns critical infrastructure, and holds stakes in other major growth stories.

With the right currency conversion and a bit of context, the prices seem almost too good to be true, especially when it comes to Zhengzhou Nissan’s Z9 lineup.

Zhengzhou Nissan, the truck-centric branch of the Dongfeng-Nissan joint venture, has just expanded the local Z9 lineup with the GE PHEV, a plug-in hybrid that serves as the electrified sibling to the locally-built Nissan Frontier Pro. The company had previously launched gas and diesel-powered versions of the Z9.

Wallet-Friendly Workhorses

The Zhengzhou Nissan Z9 starts at just ¥119,900 (equal to around $16,600 at current exchange rates) for the internal combustion version. If you’re looking for a greener option, the new Z9 GE PHEV kicks off at ¥156,900 ($21,800), still far below what most midsize pickups command elsewhere.

While the Z9 and Frontier Pro may be siblings under the surface, you can tell them apart by their grille and bumper designs. They also sport unique LED lighting signatures at both ends. Beyond that, the bodywork is identical, including the five-seat cabin.

Low Price, High Tech

Inside, the Z9 punches well above its weight for the price. A 12.8-inch infotainment display and a 10.25-inch digital instrument cluster come standard. Higher trims step it up with a 14.6-inch touchscreen, Nappa leather seats, and all the modern comforts, including heating, ventilation, massage functions, and a 12-speaker stereo. Tech features extend to four ultrasonic radars, a transparent engine hood camera mode, and four high-def cameras enabling Level 2 driver assistance.

Nissan Frontier Pro

Size and Powertrain Specs

Measuring 5,494 mm long (216.3 inches) with a 3,300 mm (129.9 inches) wheelbase, the Z9 GE PHEV fits squarely into the midsize pickup truck category. It comes exclusively in a dual-cab layout, with seating for five and a 1,520 mm (59.8 inches) long rear bed.

The plug-in hybrid system pairs a turbocharged 1.5-liter gas engine with a single electric motor. Depending on the trim, total output comes to either 322 hp (240 kW) or 429 hp (320 kW), with both versions delivering an impressive 800 Nm (590 lb-ft) of peak torque. Power goes to the rear or all four wheels via an automatic transmission designed specifically for hybrid use.

The PHEV offers two battery options. The least powerful version gets a 17 kWh battery pack, allowing an EV-only range of 60 km (37 miles). For those who want more, the larger 32.85 kWh battery extends the zero-emission range to 135 km (84 miles). As always, keep in mind these numbers are based on the more optimistic NEDC test cycle.

A Serious Bargain Compared to US Offerings

Which brings us to the surprisingly low sticker prices. The base Z9 GE PHEV starts at ¥156,900 ($21,800), while the more powerful variant with the extended EV range is priced at ¥168,900 ($23,400). Even the fully loaded flagship version, complete with all the premium features, tops out at just ¥219,900 ($30,500). For those prioritizing value above all, the entry-level diesel model with a six-speed manual can be had for only ¥119,900 ($16,600).

More: Nissan Confirms Plug-in Hybrid Frontier For America

To put things in perspective, the similarly sized US-market Nissan Frontier starts at $32,050 for the most basic 4×2 King Cab with a non-electrified 3.8-liter V6. That’s nearly double the price of the Z9, without any hint of electrification or standout tech features.

As for EV alternatives, the upcoming Slate is projected to start around $28,000. But the base model skips over even the most basic comforts, like power windows – and paint. It’ll be sold in a single molded-in-color gray, with buyers offered a $500 do-it-yourself wrap kit as the only customization option. Federal incentives could bring the price down to about $20,500, but don’t bank on it. With Trump’s so-called “Big Beautiful Bill” picking up steam, those generous tax credits may not be around much longer.

Zhengzhou Nissan hasn’t revealed pricing for the Nissan-branded Frontier Pro just yet, but it’s likely to sit slightly above the Z9 GE PHEV. What’s more interesting is that the Nissan-branded truck is also expected to become available in markets outside China, though obviously, not in America. If they manage to keep the pricing in check, it could be a compelling option.

They are reportedly Cybertrucks that the firm hasn't managed to selll yet.

The Cybertruck has been the talk of the town whole world since Elon Musk took it to the stage in Los Angeles for the official unveiling in November 2019, and the carmaker's Head of Design, Franz von Holzhausen, shattered its windows by hitting them with a steel ball and a sledgehammer.

From that moment on, orders started pouring in, and Tesla soon bragged about having collected over one million reservations. It was easy to reserve a truck. All you had to do was place a $100 deposit, which was refundable at any time. Either the one-million-reservation information was fake, or people got their deposits back because the number is nowhere to be seen.

The super-cheap Tesla Cybertruck is nowhere to be seen

Tesla started delivering the Cybertruck on November 30, 2023. The hype skyrocketed as many agreed to spec a Foundation Series, which was a $100,000 deal, in order to skip the line. Elon Musk had announced a starting price of $39,900 in November 2019, but that was before the chip crisis and before the repetitive production delays. It was the time when owners who flipped their Cybertrucks, despite the clause in the purchase contract that restricted them from doing so during the first year of ownership, brought them big money.

A Porsche dealership in Orlando bought a Cybertruck for an incredible $244,000 and listed it for sale days later for $290,000. Little did they know there would come a time when owners wouldn't even be able to get $90,000 for their electric trucks.

Furthermore, since Elon Musk joined Donald Trump's team, an unofficial boycott started against the brand, as Tesla's potential customers decided to resort to other brands, and many owners started trading in or selling their EVs. It is a move from which Cadillac benefits. General Motors has recently revealed that 25% of the customers buying an electric Caddy are former Tesla owners. So much for the brand loyalty that Tesla was bragging about.

Elon Musk departed the White House after publicly criticizing his team and complaining about the bureaucracy he had been dealing with during his 128-day mandate. We have yet to see if the move will impact Tesla's sales.

In the meantime, it seems that the automaker can't sell the Cybertruck, which was, at some point, the world's most anticipated model. The hype built around it in the previous years is now long gone, sales have come crashing down, and depreciation has its way with the model. Tesla sold just 40,000 units in 2024, and it hasn't been doing well this year either.

Tesla was hoping to move 250,000 Cybertrucks last year, but the Ford F-150 Lightning won back its crown as the best-selling electric pickup truck. As Elon Musk overpromised and underdelivered again, the Cybertruck has less range and a higher price than originally announced.

The owner of the property is in trouble

Those are solid reasons that keep customers at bay. Dozens of Cybertrucks stay parked in the parking lot of a shopping center near Detroit. The property owner is obviously in trouble.

He is violating the city code by storing dozens of Teslas in the parking lot located in suburban Detroit, as vehicle storage is not a permitted use of the land. The Teslas have basically taken over the parking spaces of the center, which is on the verge of undergoing a major redevelopment.

While trying to figure out what to do with all the pickups that it builds and is unable to sell, Tesla is storing them wherever it finds room for them. One of the places that accepted to host the firm's trucks was a run-down mall, the Hunter's Square, located in Farmington Hills, outside Detroit, Michigan, which got officials fuming.

Many of the stores that once operated there are now closed, but several fast-food restaurants are still open, which means a relatively reduced number of customers still visit the center. However, the Teslas are currently occupying several rows normally reserved for customers.

Penalizing the owner takes time

Automotive News reports that Charmaine Kettler-Scmult, director of planning and community development for Farmington Hills, Michigan, stated that city officials had already informed the shopping center landlord of the violation and asked him to clear the area. However, enforcing the evacuation procedure is time-consuming.

Tesla recently opened a brand-new showroom near Hunter's Square shopping center in West Bloomfield. The Cybertrucks parked at the mall might have been sourced from the showroom.

The firm is also counting on the single-motor rear-wheel drive Cybertruck to boost sales. The latest version quietly appeared in the online configurator back in April, with a starting price of $69,990. It is still light years away from the $39,900 Cybertruck that Elon Musk promised in November 2019.",https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images/news/tesla-cybertrucks-pile-up-in-detroit-parking-lot-what-are-they-doing-there-252286_1.jpg,N,,2025-05-31 18:07:27.491169

Foreign representatives visiting Alaska for the discussions in coming days are expected to include representatives from Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Philippines, India and the United Arab Emirates, said people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified because they weren’t authorized to speak publicly.

The US delegation will be led by Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, who’s also the chair of Trump’s National Energy Dominance Council; the panel’s vice-chair, Energy Secretary Chris Wright; and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin, the people said.

The trip is set to include visits to an oil pipeline and gas processing facilities on Alaska’s North Slope as well as meetings with industry officials and indigenous people, they said.

It comes as Trump moves to expand energy development in the state, a priority he outlined in an executive order hours after his Jan. 20 inauguration. And it coincides with a broad push by other nations to curry favor with the president, including through investment commitments, to ward off threatened tariffs.

Trump has repeatedly touted the $44 billion Alaska LNG project, which is meant to transport natural gas across the state for export. Although it has been planned for decades, the project faces headwinds due to its large price tag, mammoth scale and the sheer challenge of constructing an 800-mile (1,290 kilometers) pipeline across Alaska.

Trump pressed Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba on the project during their meeting in February, winning his commitment to cooperate on strengthening energy security, “including increasing exports of United States liquefied natural gas to Japan in a mutually beneficial manner.”

Representatives of the Philippines, Taiwan and South Korea also have been in talks with administration officials on the venture.

Discussions are expected to unfold over several days, including during site visits at the prolific Prudhoe Bay oil field, which has pumped crude for roughly five decades, and where units of ConocoPhillips and Hilcorp Energy Co. have operations. Other conversations are expected in Utqiagvik and Anchorage, including as part of Governor Mike Dunleavy’s Alaska Sustainable Energy Conference.

Trump officials see the visit as a chance to highlight the administration’s focus on unleashing Alaska’s energy abundance and draw a contrast with policies under former President Joe Biden they say locked up the state’s oil, gas and mineral potential. While Alaska LNG will be a significant portion of the discussions, a person familiar with the matter said, there’s an opportunity to examine the state’s resource potential and further policy shifts that can help deliver it.

At the heart of this initiative is a Corporate Power Purchase Agreement (CPPA), the first of its kind for the UK rail network.
Under the 14-year agreement, Network Rail will purchase 64 gigawatt hours (GWh) of renewable electricity annually at a fixed cost.
Over the full 14-year span, the clean energy supplied will be sufficient to run all 20 Network Rail-managed stations for eight consecutive years.
James Schwerdt, Head of Solar at EDF Renewables UK, said: “We are very pleased to be working with Network Rail to help them transition to green, renewable, low-carbon energy.","Network Rail is set to tap into clean energy from a newly commissioned solar farm in Norfolk, thanks to a landmark deal with EDF Renewables UK. Construction at Bloy’s Grove, just outside Swainsthorpe and within sight of the Great Eastern Main Line, is poised to begin, with the energy generated playing a pivotal role in decarbonising Britain’s railway infrastructure.

At the heart of this initiative is a Corporate Power Purchase Agreement (CPPA), the first of its kind for the UK rail network. Under the 14-year agreement, Network Rail will purchase 64 gigawatt hours (GWh) of renewable electricity annually at a fixed cost. This will account for around 15% of the electricity needed to power its offices, depots, and managed stations, collectively referred to as non-traction energy.

To put this in perspective, a single year’s worth of energy under the CPPA would be enough to power London Liverpool Street station for nine years. Over the full 14-year span, the clean energy supplied will be sufficient to run all 20 Network Rail-managed stations for eight consecutive years.

Rail Minister Lord Hendy said: “We are working with partners across the rail industry to build a modern transport network with our environmental commitments at the heart. The Government’s Plan for Change is driving economic growth, transitioning the country to sustainable energy, and securing jobs. Under our new integrated approach, we are ensuring the British rail industry remains at the forefront of innovation and improvement.”

The move aligns with Network Rail’s broader Green Strategy, which charts a course toward a more sustainable future for rail travel. The company isn’t stopping here. Plans are underway to secure additional CPPAs to transition all of its non-traction electricity eventually to solar, a significant leap toward full sustainability.

“With the railway industry set to unite under Great British Railways, this contract, our Green Strategy, and a cohesive railway system provide us with even more opportunities to reduce emissions and make our railway even greener.”

Jo Lewington, chief environment and sustainability officer at Network Rail, said: “Travelling by train is already one of the most sustainable ways of getting around, and we know we can do more as a business. In future, we would like all of our office and station power to come from sustainable sources, and this contract is a huge step forward towards that.”

EDF Renewables UK will build, operate, and manage the Bloy’s Grove facility. Over its projected lifespan, the solar farm is expected to offset approximately 60,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide, the equivalent of planting more than 2.2 million trees.

And it’s not just the environment that stands to benefit. EDF Renewables has also committed to investing in the local community, pledging £20,000 per year to a community fund for the whole 35-year operational life of the solar project.

James Schwerdt, Head of Solar at EDF Renewables UK, said: “We are very pleased to be working with Network Rail to help them transition to green, renewable, low-carbon energy. This project shows the importance of technologies such as solar in reducing costs and de-carbonising the UK electricity system to reach the country’s target of net zero by 2050.”","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/becc64_51e599419291474cb78769ba9ac2a9a4~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_667,h_1000,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01/becc64_51e599419291474cb78769ba9ac2a9a4~mv2.jpg",N,,2025-05-31 19:07:27.614532

""This unique partnership with Avina and KBR will result in on-site SAF production and fills a growing need for our airline partners and the industry overall,"" Pittsburgh International Airport CEO Christina Cassotis said.
The process is a low-cost industrial-scale process that produces jet fuel with properties similar to conventional jet fuel, making it fully fungible.
The assessment for California aviation turbine fuel, which consists of 30% SAF and 70% kerosene jet fuel, was assessed at 4.76/gal.","Pittsburgh International Airport and Avina Synthetic Aviation Fuel have announced plans to develop the first on-site sustainable aviation fuel production facility in US.

The facility announced May 29 will be just south of PIT's terminal and is expected to dramatically enhance access to low-carbon jet fuel for commercial and cargo carriers operating in the region.

While other SAF plants operate elsewhere, PIT's facility situated just south of the terminal will be the first integrated within a major airport's infrastructure.

The facility will use KBR's PureSAF alcohol-to-jet technology, developed by Swedish Biofuels and globally licensed by KBR, converting renewable alcohol into jet fuel that meets ASTM certification and global sustainability standards.

KBR's PureSAF technology is an alcohol-to-jet process that converts various feedstocks, including bioethanol, syngas and carbon dioxide, into sustainable aviation fuel.

In addition to processing ethanol, this technology can also convert mixed alcohols, carbon dioxide and synthesis gas to SAF, creating pathways for utilizing captured carbon usage.

""This unique partnership with Avina and KBR will result in on-site SAF production and fills a growing need for our airline partners and the industry overall,"" Pittsburgh International Airport CEO Christina Cassotis said. ""With abundant natural resources, robust energy infrastructure and available fuel storage, PIT is uniquely positioned to meet these goals and serve the growing demands for SAF.""

The process is a low-cost industrial-scale process that produces jet fuel with properties similar to conventional jet fuel, making it fully fungible. This technology is particularly attractive for its ability to utilize a wide range of feedstocks, including waste biomass and biogenic CO2.

Through multiple development phases, the facility is expected to produce over 100 million gallons of SAF annually, helping to significantly reduce the aviation sector's carbon footprint.

Much lower carbon intensity

The SAF produced at PIT will have a carbon intensity at least 65% lower than conventional jet fuel, according to project estimates, contributing meaningfully to the industry's decarbonization goals.

""KBR is proud to support the Pittsburgh International Airport team and enable it to be one of the first airports globally to provide SAF to its customers by producing it on-site at the airport,"" Hari Ravindran, KBR's Global SVP for Technology, said. ""PureSAF (alcohol-to-jet) technology is designed to allow the facility to deliver 100% drop-in fuel made from renewable feedstocks while meeting global specifications for sustainable jet fuel. This project is a real example of how innovation and strong business relationships are delivering tangible benefits to the aviation industry.""

The PIT-Avina initiative aligns with broader efforts across the aviation sector to cut emissions and build resilient fuel infrastructure. As airlines face increasing regulatory and market pressure to decarbonize, projects like this may define the next generation of airport operations and fuel logistics in the US.

Construction is set to begin soon, with phased rollout expected to support regional airline partners and national SAF supply chain expansion.

At a steel mill just outside of Pittsburgh last night, President Trump applauded a potential deal between U.S. Steel Corporation and Japan's Nippon Steel - one that he says would bring billions in investment from the Japanese company.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And it includes vital protections to ensure that all steelworkers will keep their jobs and all facilities in the United States will remain open and thriving.

SIMON: Now, Trump had opposed the deal as a candidate but now says it will be good for America and that U.S. Steel will still have an American CEO and a corporate board with a U.S. majority. But he was light on specifics and even admitted later, there is no final deal.

NPR's Don Gonyea's in Pittsburgh. Don, thanks for being with us.

DON GONYEA, BYLINE: Good morning.

SIMON: What's the reaction in steel country?

GONYEA: I've been in and around Allegheny County these past couple of days, and in West Mifflin, where a key U.S. Steel facility is located. So let's start there with the local mayor. His name is Chris Kelly.

What was your immediate reaction?

CHRIS KELLY: I started to cry. I mean, I've lived this for a year and a half, and I thought, wow, this is - I wasn't expecting it.

GONYEA: And he made it clear that they were tears of joy, he's talking.

SIMON: Did the mayor talk about how his community had been hurt by the decline of U.S. Steel?

GONYEA: Yeah. He's lived it. He grew up in a nearby town, where, he says, it was decades of decline. He says one mill after another closed, and more than 200,000 jobs disappeared.

KELLY: And I saw the devastation that came along with individuals losing their homes and their jobs, their cars, their families - you know, turned to drug abuse, eventually, domestic violences. And I didn't want to see that.

GONYEA: And he sees the new investments from Nippon Steel as new life.

SIMON: And what did people in the community tell you?

GONYEA: Most are only just learning some of the details, but it's welcomed. I met 55-year-old Malik Swain (ph) outside a local restaurant. He said it's good news, including what updating these old mills will mean for the environment.

MALIK SWAIN: I think it's good for the Mon Valley, actually. I think it's going to keep jobs there, grow it. They're also going to upgrade the facility. So I think that's a good thing as far as air quality goes, hopefully.

GONYEA: And then, Scott, I do want to note here that the United Steelworkers - the national union - has long been opposed to Nippon coming in, citing national security and allegations of unfair trade practices.

SIMON: Of course, Don, it's interesting that the president has really increased trade pressure on other countries. What do his supporters say about Nippon Steel - which is, after all, a Japanese company potentially - taking over what was a company that was once such a cornerstone of U.S. manufacturing.

GONYEA: And that was a big reason, during the campaign last year, that both candidate Trump and President Biden opposed this proposed deal with Nippon Steel. Now, though, such concerns seem to be overridden by the prospect of more jobs. But listen to this - I heard this from a local resident. His name is Mike Medich (ph).

MIKE MEDICH: I'm glad it's Japan rather than China because China has a lot of investments in our country, which I don't think they should have.

GONYEA: And I'll add here that Medich doesn't necessarily see this as a big engine for new jobs, but, he says, had this mill closed, that would have been a real blow to the community.

The Road Ahead: A Smarter EV Manufacturing Ecosystem The journey toward fully automated and digitized EV manufacturing in India is just beginning, but the pace is picking up.
Conclusion The convergence of automation and Industry 4.0 is revolutionizing the landscape of EV manufacturing.","The transition to electric vehicles (EV) in India is not coming — it is existing. As of mid-2025, EV sales were growing at an exceptional rate of greater than 45% annually while government level initiatives that fuel demand and incentives at a program level, such as the PM e-Drive or the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) programs, are spurring greater investment in the EV manufacturing space. But manufacturing is not about policy or demand; it is about the merging of automation and Industry 4.0 — in other words, a revolution changing the structure of EV manufacturing at the core.

To create faster, smarter, globally competitive EV manufacturing, India must leverage Industry 4.0 technologies, defined as a network of smart machines, data systems and connected platforms that allows factories to self-monitor, plan, predict and change stipulations in real time.

In this article, we will discuss how Industry 4.0 and automation are reshaping EV manufacturing processes in India and around the world about more efficient production lines, better quality control and more scalable solutions.

Materializing Industry 4.0 in EV Manufacturing

Industry 4.0 sometimes known as the Fourth Industrial Revolution — relates to the digitization of manufacturing using different technologies, including artificial intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), robotics, big data analytics, cloud computing, and cyber-physical systems. When applied to EV manufacturing, it results in smart factories where machines communicate, make decisions, and optimize performance with minimal human intervention.

Leading Indian EV OEMs like Tata Motors, Mahindra Electric, Ola Electric, and Ather Energy are investing heavily in smart production facilities that are equipped with Industry 4.0 frameworks. Automated ecosystems are making possible real-time quality assurance, predictive maintenance, and flexible assembly lines essential to rapid, efficient EV production.

Why is Automation So Important in EV Manufacturing

Unlike traditional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, electric vehicles (EVs) have unique requirements – high-voltage batteries (with thermal management), power electronics, and lightweight frames. Because of this complexity and need for greater precision and repeatability, automation is essential to EV manufacturing.

Automation is providing repeatability, speed, and safety in battery module assembly, welding aluminum body frames, winding motors – including for software calibrations! By 2025, robots had become a dominant factor in India’s leading EV manufacturing factories.

For example:

Tata Motors has implemented collaborative robots (cobots) for automated spot welding and battery handling at its Pune facility.

MG Motor India is utilizing advanced AI and machine learning tools, in collaboration with SAIC, to reduce defects in production and human error.

BYD India has applied more than 60% robotic automation in the bus and battery manufacturing units.

These developments indicate a strong movement toward Industry 4.0 ecosystems that will form the future of EV manufacturing in the India.

Key Industry 4.0 Technologies Reshaping EV Manufacturing

1. Digital Twins

Also a digital twin is a virtual real-time copy of a physical asset, or physical business process. In electric vehicle manufacturing, it has allowed engineers to simulate the production process, battery performance, and thermal characteristics of a finished vehicle by modelling aspects such as material performance and operational parameters before actual deployment. Digital twins can allow for reduced time-to-market and real-time remote monitoring of the processes at operational plant locations.

2. IoT and Smart Sensors

IoT sensors situated in machines or along assembly lines, can collect meaningful operational data related to temperature, vibration, energy usage, and torque so that parts can be evaluated for predictive maintenance and can also optimize processes by minimizing downtime and improving operational efficiencies in existing EV manufacturing units.

3. AI and Predictive Analytics

AI systems compute massive amounts of data to predict equipment failures and optimize inventory management, alongside maximizing yield. AI-based vision systems have also been adopted for real-time quality inspection of EV batteries and wiring.

4. Additive Manufacturing (3D Printing)

3D printing facilitates iterative development of EV components for prototyping and small-batch requirements like battery enclosures, housings, and custom cooling plates. Many EV manufacturing start-ups are now integrating additive manufacturing as an opportunity to reduce development costs and waste.

5. Cloud and Edge Computing

Data generated on the factory floor is now processed on edge devices for immediate insights, or stored in cloud data platforms for more traditional macro-level analytics. This hybrid system, where data is processed at the edge such as the manufacturing plant and aggregated in the cloud as necessary, allows for faster decision making across geographically dispersed EV manufacturing ecosystems.

Industry 4.0 and Supply Chain Integration

Another significant benefit of Industry 4.0 in EV manufacturing is the creation of smart, connected supply chains. Manufacturers can now track components in real-time, reduce lead times, and synchronize procurement with demand forecasting.

With EV components like lithium-ion batteries, semiconductors, and controllers often coming from diverse vendors, a digital supply chain helps reduce delays and avoid overstocking. Companies like Bosch, Bharat Forge, and Sona BLW have integrated smart supply chain platforms to enable seamless component flow into EV manufacturing plants.

Challenges to Adoption in India

While the benefits are immense, India’s EV manufacturing sector still faces hurdles in fully adopting Industry 4.0:

High Capital Expenditure: Setting up smart factories with robotics, AI, and IoT infrastructure involves substantial initial investment.

Workforce Skill Gap: There’s a significant lack of trained technicians, engineers, and operators familiar with Industry 4.0 tools.

Legacy Systems: Many traditional auto manufacturers have outdated ERP systems that are not compatible with modern automation platforms.

Cybersecurity: The connected nature of Industry 4.0 systems makes them vulnerable to cyber-attacks, requiring robust data protection protocols.

To overcome these, the government and industry bodies must collaborate on workforce skilling programs, offer tax incentives for tech upgrades, and promote standardized frameworks for smart EV manufacturing.

Government Push and Industry Partnerships

Recognizing the critical role of Industry 4.0 in boosting global competitiveness, the Indian government has included digital transformation under the PLI Auto Scheme. The Ministry of Heavy Industries has announced funding for pilot EV manufacturing projects that demonstrate end-to-end automation and data analytics integration.

Collaborations between OEMs and tech giants like Siemens, ABB, Bosch, and Infosys are also enabling smooth adoption of Industry 4.0 systems in EV assembly lines. Startups like Entuple E-Mobility and Numocity are developing India-specific solutions for real-time energy monitoring and digital diagnostics in EV manufacturing.

The Road Ahead: A Smarter EV Manufacturing Ecosystem

The journey toward fully automated and digitized EV manufacturing in India is just beginning, but the pace is picking up. In 2025, every major EV player is either scaling up its smart factory operations or investing in next-gen digital infrastructure.

The long-term vision is clear — India must become not just an EV consumer market but also a global hub for advanced EV manufacturing. To get there, embracing Industry 4.0 isn’t optional — it’s essential.

From AI-guided robots assembling battery packs to cloud platforms managing plant operations from thousands of kilometers away, the future of EV manufacturing lies in intelligent, interconnected systems. And with the right partnerships, investments, and policy support, India is well-positioned to lead this transformation.

Conclusion

The convergence of automation and Industry 4.0 is revolutionizing the landscape of EV manufacturing. It offers not just increased productivity and reduced costs, but also ensures higher precision, lower emissions, and scalable growth. As India accelerates toward its clean mobility goals, EV manufacturing powered by Industry 4.0 will be the cornerstone of this new industrial age.",https://www.evmechanica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Automation-and-Industry-4.0-in-EV-Manufacturing-Powering-the-Future-of-Mobility-1.jpg,N,,2025-05-31 19:07:23.310028

""We are supposed to start putting together the funding bills for 2026 next week.","WASHINGTON — The Trump administration released significantly more detail about its budget request Friday evening, giving Congress the information it needs for lawmakers to draft the annual government funding bills.

The 1,224-page document sheds light on where exactly President Donald Trump and White House budget director Russ Vought want lawmakers to cut federal spending during the upcoming fiscal year.

The Office of Management and Budget released a “skinny” version of the annual proposal in early May, requesting lawmakers cut domestic spending by $163 billion and keep funding for defense programs flat in the dozen annual appropriations bills.

While the documents in that request provided some insight into how Trump wants to reshape the size and scope of about $1.7 trillion in discretionary funding, which is spending that Congress directs, they didn’t include the level of detail that the Appropriations committees need to begin their work.

The appendix document released Friday should aid in that, though it does not represent a full budget request. That type of proposal would include the White House’s goals for mandatory programs, like Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security, which make up about two-thirds of federal spending. Such spending is required by law and is not subject to annual appropriations.

A full budget request also typically includes tax policy proposals, though with Republicans in Congress already working to enact an extension of the 2017 GOP tax law in the “big, beautiful bill,” those sections would likely be of little use to lawmakers at this point.

Work on spending bills launching

The House Appropriations Committee is scheduled to release and debate its 12 government funding bills throughout June, before voting to send those measures to the floor.

Chairman Tom Cole, R-Okla., will likely include funding levels and policy closely aligned with the White House request, since legislation in that chamber can pass a floor vote with a simple majority

Senate Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Susan Collins, R-Maine, has a more challenging task, since regular bills in that chamber require bipartisanship to get past the 60-vote legislative filibuster. Republicans control the Senate with 53 members.

In general, that means the Senate panel’s bills tend to look much more like the final version that becomes law than the House bills, though not always.

Both chambers are supposed to reach a bipartisan, bicameral agreement on the dozen bills before the start of the next fiscal year on Oct. 1, but that rarely happens.

Congress is much more likely to use a stopgap spending bill until mid-December to give members more time to negotiate funding levels and policies on thousands of government programs.

The House and Senate were unable to reach agreement for this fiscal year, and instead leaned on a series of three continuing resolutions to keep the government up and running.

Partial shutdown could loom again

Tensions over the proposed funding cuts in Trump’s first budget request of his second term could reach a boiling point if Cole, Collins, House ranking member Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut and Senate ranking member Patty Murray cannot broker an agreement before their deadline.

Failure to enact some sort of government funding legislation — either the dozen full-year bills, or a stopgap spending measure — would lead to a partial government shutdown.

Murray, D-Wash., wrote in a statement released Friday evening that it was “telling that President Trump has chosen to release his budget on a Friday night with no fanfare whatsoever.”

“This is a draconian proposal to hurt working people and our economy, and it is dead on arrival in Congress as long as I have anything to say about it,” Murray wrote. “But this is just another reminder we need Republicans to join us to reject these reckless cuts, focus on the investments we actually need to make in our communities and security, and to finally force Trump to follow the law and end his devastating funding freeze.”

DeLauro wrote in a statement that the ""government envisioned by President Trump only serves billionaires and the biggest corporations and would do nothing to lower the cost of living.”

“This is not a complete budget,"" she wrote. ""We are supposed to start putting together the funding bills for 2026 next week. If, as expected, House Republicans follow what President Trump has proposed so far, it is not a serious effort to deliver for the American people.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/2025-05/trumprfkmcmahon.jpg?h=0a8b6f8b&itok=uqNRcgly,N,,2025-05-31 18:07:13.515960

I’m proud to have worked in tandem with my colleagues and President Trump to make good on a promise I made.

On May 22, Congress struck down a key aspect of the Biden Administration’s nationwide EV mandate under the Congressional Review Act (CRA). This is a win for American consumers and protects Congress’s constitutional and statutory oversight authority over federal agencies and unelected bureaucratic overreach.

How did we get here?

More than 50 years ago, Congress allowed California to request a “wavier” from applicable federal air regulations. Congress provided California this tool because the state had extraordinarily poor air quality and unique challenges to control it. Recently, California has abused that discreet authority to set climate policy across the country.

In December of 2024, the lame duck Biden Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) approved California’s request to implement its “Advanced Clean Cars II” regulation when Democrats wouldn’t have to face voters over this politically toxic policy.

California’s ACC II waiver requires all vehicles sold in the state, Washington D.C., and the 11 other states that have adopted California’s standard to be zero emissions vehicles by 2035. This means in one decade that these states, totaling 30 percent of the nation’s new car market, will have a full ban on the sale of gasoline powered vehicles and traditional hybrids. These unattainable standards, backed by a fine of over $26,000 per vehicle for non-compliance, would reshape auto manufacturing and take away consumer choice across the country.

Only 2.3 percent of new vehicle registrations in West Virginia last year were EVs. Nationwide, EVs accounted for only 10.2 percent of new vehicle registrations. West Virginians don’t want California’s climate policy, and West Virginians don’t want California’s EV mandate. I’m confident that most Americans don’t want these things either.

The Biden EPA tried to avoid accountability from Congress by claiming their decision was not a rule and refusing to submit it to Congress under the CRA. Fortunately, President Trump corrected this by identifying the waiver as a rule and submitting it to Congress.

To protect American consumers and workers, as well as the Senate’s oversight authority of bad agency rules, I introduced a resolution under the CRA to reverse EPA’s California waiver. Using this statutory process allows members of the Senate and the House – the constitutionally elected representatives of all Americans – to decide whether a nationally significant agency rule should move forward.

After the rule was submitted to Congress, Senate Democrats who wanted to protect this EV mandate requested the Government Accountability Office (GAO) find the waiver was not a rule under the CRA. GAO has consistently found that once a rule is submitted by an agency, GAO does not issue an opinion. Despite its own precedent, GAO “observed” in a letter that the Biden EPA action approving California’s waiver was not a rule under the CRA, despite the agency’s submittal to Congress.

Democrats got this GAO letter to obstruct the Senate from exercising its authority provided by the CRA. Nothing in the plain text of the CRA, Senate Rules, or Senate precedents gives unelected staff at the GAO the authority to prevent the Senate from considering a resolution of disapproval against a rule that has been submitted to Congress.

Once an agency submits a rule to Congress, as EPA did here, elected representatives are able to decide whether to approve or disapprove of the rule. That is how the CRA and GAO precedent has functioned since its enactment in 1996 as a statutory exception to the Senate’s normal practice of unlimited debate. This allows Congress to realize the fundamental purpose of the CRA – oversight by elected representatives over unelected agencies.

Democrat Senators claim that our action undermines the legislative filibuster. That is simply untrue. Unlike my Democrat colleagues, I have supported the legislative filibuster as a Senator in the majority and as a Senator in the minority. The procedural action we have taken is not about the filibuster. Instead, the procedural action the Senate has taken is simply about whether GAO staff can violate its own precedent and have veto authority over elected officials’ ability to use the CRA against rules submitted to Congress by an agency. The answer is no.

Despite the best efforts of unelected bureaucrats in California, the Biden Administration, and congressional Democrats to shield this EV mandate from the will of the American people, Congress has rejected California’s attempt to impose an electric vehicle mandate that would have eliminated consumer choice, increased prices, and killed jobs across the country.

The suit from the service that airs “Sesame Street,” Ken Burns documentaries and the “PBS NewsHour” for free to millions of American homes, said that Congress has repeatedly protected PBS from political interference by filtering its funds through the Corp. for Public Broadcasting, which is not a federal agency.

“The [executive order] makes no attempt to hide the fact that it is cutting off the flow of funds to PBS because of the content of PBS programming and out of a desire to alter the content of speech.”

NPR, which also receives CPB funding, filed a suit on similar grounds on Tuesday.

Kilton Webb is a member of the IBEW Local 567 and a member of the Maine House of Representatives.

As an IBEW member in Maine representing over 4,000 workers, I know firsthand how important clean energy is to making our economy work for all of us. Investments in clean energy have enabled our union locals to create good-paying jobs, and drive down energy costs — something at the top of every Mainer’s mind — all while helping America maintain our global competitiveness.

The U.S. House budget reconciliation bill, however, proposes what amounts to a total repeal of many clean energy investments, putting our jobs at risk. As SEIA, the primary trade organization for the solar industry, put it: “this proposed legislation will effectively dismantle the most successful industrial onshoring effort in U.S. history.”

Let’s be clear: This bill is a direct assault on American manufacturing and American-made energy right here in Maine.

I have seen the benefits of clean energy investments myself. I began my career as an electrician, and my first job was on a solar field in Kennebunk. I’ve built dozens of solar farms across the state, a job that has helped me pay off debt, purchase a home, and advance to a journeyman electrician. I am honored to now represent Durham in the Maine House of Representatives.

I strongly support clean energy investments at both the federal level and in the private sector because they are fueling a clean energy economic boom with companies like Nyle Water Heating Systems here in Maine.

Maine has been a national leader in clean energy generation, with over two-thirds of the state’s total energy generation coming from clean energy, including 27 percent from wind and 13 percent from solar. We will need even more to meet rising demand.

Unfortunately, we have already seen how extreme Republican attempts to repeal clean energy are impacting Maine’s energy supply and jobs. In April 2025, Maine’s first planned offshore wind array Pine Tree Offshore Wind paused the project because of President Donald Trump’s opposition to wind energy. This delay is pulling the plug on 144 megawatts of energy, shrinking the state’s energy supply and putting the burden on Maine families.

Repeal of clean energy tax credits will also hurt Maine disproportionately because our rural state has 145 utility-scale projects either operating or in development across the state that could be eligible for these tax credits. That means 9,100 jobs, $8.8 billion in investment, and nearly 5,000 megawatts of power generation or storage.

The Trump Administration has already arbitrarily attacked Mainers’ access to energy efficient heat pumps that can help bring the costs of heating and cooling our homes under control, even as Maine is embracing them more and more, but now U.S. House Republicans want to immediately repeal all federal tax credits that can help working people lower their energy bills. All of this to cover a small fraction of tax cuts that go primarily to the wealthy — how does that make any sense?

Sen. Susan Collins, who has represented us since 1997, has been a longtime supporter of Maine’s clean energy development. Her support for Form Energy’s battery energy storage in Lincoln, for example, helped establish the largest long-duration energy storage project in the world. On April 9, four of her Republican colleagues in the Senate wrote in a letter to Senate Majority Leader John Thune, in support of the clean energy tax credits that have brought direct benefits to so many parts of the country.

“As Republicans committed to strengthening America’s energy security and economic growth, we write to emphasize the importance of maintaining a stable and predictable tax framework to promote domestic energy development. While we support fiscal responsibility and prudent efforts to streamline the tax code, we caution against the full-scale repeal of current credits, which could lead to significant disruptions for the American people and weaken our position as a global energy leader,” they wrote in their letter.

This is exactly right. Unfortunately, the House bill will implement unreasonable phaseouts, impossible red tape and restrictions, or outright termination of tax credits for clean energy that together make the tax credits completely unworkable, by design. This bill is essentially a full-scale repeal. It also repeals home energy tax credits, which would lead directly to higher energy costs, in addition to good-paying jobs.

Repealing clean energy tax credits would gut America’s clean energy production, raising costs for Maine families and killing hundreds of thousands of good-paying manufacturing jobs nationwide. Trump and Republicans promised to lower energy costs. Instead, this legislation would undermine America’s fastest-growing, most affordable energy sources.

Thankfully, Collins has an opportunity to inject some common sense into this bill and protect clean energy and the jobs that come along with it. Now that the bill has passed the House, it will move to the Senate next. Repealing clean energy investments would be bad for American businesses and bad for American workers. I urge Collins to continue being the leader we need and fix this reckless legislation.",https://i0.wp.com/bdn-data.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/05/climate-change-ski-mountain-snow-maine-bennett-2.jpg?fit=1200%2C800&ssl=1,N,,2025-05-31 20:06:14.702211

Gavin Newsom.

Newsom recently announced the launch of CalHeatScore, a cutting-edge tool to forecast and rank heat severity risks and connect Californians with available resources to stay safe during extreme heat events. With CalHeatScore, California becomes the first state in the nation — and one of the only jurisdictions in the world — to launch a heat-ranking system. Newsom’s office says this announcement comes as the Trump administration makes life-threatening cuts to the federal government’s weather monitoring apparatus.

CalHeatScore, developed by the California Environmental Protection Agency’s Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment, brings together ZIP code level data to provide locally tailored guidance. The tool identifies groups most susceptible to extreme heat — such as older adults and children — and provides tips for staying safe, such as how to recognize signs of heat illness. The tool additionally integrates other important data sets, like locations for the nearest cooling centers.

Newsom additionally announced $32.4 million to support 47 California communities in lifesaving extreme heat mitigation efforts. The Extreme Heat and Community Resilience Program aims to support local, tribal and regional efforts to combat dangerous heat exposure by building long-lasting infrastructure solutions and strengthening community resilience needed to withstand extreme heat events.

“Extreme heat kills — and with the federal government cutting the very programs that help forecast it, California is taking aggressive action to protect residents from the impacts of extreme heat and build resilience in our most vulnerable communities,” said Newsom. “With the first major heat of the summer expected this weekend, we’re connecting more Californians — particularly those that are most vulnerable to dangerous heat — to life-saving information, resources and programs across the state.”

In a hotter, drier world, connecting Californians with extreme weather information and resources has never been more important — especially as the federal government cuts critical programs providing pertinent information on weather, added Newsom’s office.

First-in-the-nation heat-ranking tool

The new CalHeatScore tool will be leveraged across state government, providing early warning that allows resources to be mobilized with greater speed and precision to communities that need it, promise staffers. To ensure the new tool works for Californians, the state will continue gathering input from the public, which will be used to shape future updates.

“Every single preventable death is one too many,” said Yana Garcia, California’s secretary for environmental protection. “This groundbreaking tool will help Californians plan and respond so they can stay safe when a heat wave is about to strike. And it will shore up the state’s all-in fight against the very real dangers that climate change keeps bringing to our doorstep.”

In 2021, the California Department of Insurance’s Climate Insurance Workgroup recommended California build a system to rank heat waves to better communicate the deadly risks to Californians and help communities prepare, similar to how tropical storms and hurricanes are described by category level.

As part of a broader climate package in 2022, Newsom signed Assembly Bill 2238 by Assemblymember Luz Rivas to codify CDI’s recommendation by requiring the state to develop a statewide extreme heat ranking system.

“CalHeatScore is an important tool to prepare Californians for extreme heat,” said Nancy Ward, director of the California Governor’s Office of Emergency Services. “It helps increase our readiness for heat events and protect those at greatest risk.”

Building on investments to protect Californians

The funding recently announced builds on the governor’s extreme heat action plan, which guides the state’s response to extreme heat events. Developed in partnership with more than 20 state agencies and informed by more than 1,000 individuals through listening sessions and public engagement, these grants respond directly to community needs and build on existing state programs.

Extreme heat solutions announced recently combine physical infrastructure with nature-based solutions and in-home technology to create more resilient communities. In Northern California, for example, North Coast Opportunities and the Middletown Rancheria of Pomo Indians of California will partner to provide solar-powered air conditioning in the homes of vulnerable community members.

“California is taking aggressive action to protect residents from the impacts of extreme heat and build resilience in our most vulnerable communities,” said Samuel Assefa, director of Governor’s Office of Land Use and Climate Innovation, the agency overseeing the funding. “With lives on the line each summer, the Extreme Heat and Community Resilience Program will provide critical infrastructure investments in heat vulnerable communities.”

Extreme heat is the leading cause of weather-related deaths in the state, claiming more lives annually than any other climate threat, including fires and floods. Last year, California communities experienced the hottest summer on record in 130 years. According to a report from the Department of Insurance, from 2013 to 2022, seven extreme heat events resulted in nearly 460 deaths, over 5,000 hospitalizations and about 344 adverse birth outcomes.

State research shows a correlation between heat and a range of negative health effects including death, lower birth weight and increased emergency room visits and hospitalizations for conditions ranging from heart conditions to poor mental health. Extreme heat also takes an economic toll on the state, with an estimated $7.7 billion of lost wages, agricultural disruptions and power outages.

Everyone’s property rights need to be respected in terms of new energy generation and distribution.
Wind turbines, solar panels and high-power transmission towers will always have a certain amount of industrial look to them.","Much has been in local news about electric power generation and distribution centering around solar power, as well as the “Grain Belt Express” power distribution plans that affect Pike County in Illinois and Ralls County in Missouri.

Going back in history, Thomas Edison was a pioneer in technology development and one of the first to develop the new technology of electrification. However, he was human, and his quest to provide the distribution of electrical power was flawed in the fact that what he proposed as Direct Current (DC) power could not be up- or down-converted in voltage. So, the size of the wire to transmit electric power would have been massive like the cables of the Golden Gate Bridge.

A guy by the name of George Westinghouse, however, had the idea of using Alternating Current (AC) on what would become the preferred form to transmit electric energy over long distances and be used by all consumers. The use of electrical transformers could up-convert and down-convert the electrical energy from more than 100kV down to 120V in those early days, as it still does today.

Fast forward nearly 130 years later and the development of high-power regulators to convert AC power to DC and inverters to convert DC power to AC, along with storage batteries such as lithium iron phosphate, has been developed.

It is good to look at new developments that now allow more efficient long-distance transmission of electrical energy by DC current, replacing a four-wire WYE configuration AC lines with only a two-wire DC current run. This is what is planned with “The Grain Belt Express” plan that has strong opposition from people like Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey.

His concern about the issue of eminent domain is valid, but his assumption that the project is of a “radical ‘green agenda” is not. As an attorney, it would be good if he stuck to using his skills to mitigate property conflicts in adapting such new technologies, while realizing he may not be an expert on such technologies himself.

This project will allow four separate electric grid systems in North America to be connected efficiently to better distribute and manage the load requirements of wind turbines and solar, as well as other energy sources of the United States and Canada. Situations such as the power grid failure in Texas in February 2021, an isolated grid from the rest of the U.S. that saw the system drop to as low as 59.4 AC cycles per second and colipase, need to be avoided in the future with sound engineering and energy development programs like the HVDC power Grain Belt Express.

Newly developed technology with wind turbines now allows the replacement of mechanical gear drive mechanisms in their hubs that were needed to reach 60-cycle AC to be replaced with AC-to-DC solid state regulators and inverters, either in the hubs or at the location, to allow an entire wind turbine farm to be more efficient. They are similar in manner but in reverse to your outside central air conditioner, which takes 60-cycle AC power and converts it in a regulator to DC, then through an inverter to run back to an AC motor — not at 60 cycles but as low as 20 cycles to run as energy efficient while meeting the heat dissipation requirements and as quiet as possible.

Latest technologies have developed to provide effective high-speed circuit breaker disconnects of the high-voltage DC lines. Unlike AC power, which goes to 0 volts 60 times per second, the DC current level is constant. To the nearest thousand miles, electricity travels at 186,000 miles per second. If you see wind turbines not rotating at a given location, you can pretty much assume the wind is blowing through others in other locations most times in our country.

Yes, solar panels only convert energy during the day, and we need sources like natural gas-driven turbine power plants to generate electricity in the years to come. However, taking action like making our long line power grid transmit DC power can mitigate the interoperability problems of 60-cycle AC power grids with wind turbines and solar sources we face today.

Everyone’s property rights need to be respected in terms of new energy generation and distribution. Wind turbines, solar panels and high-power transmission towers will always have a certain amount of industrial look to them. We need to make sure we are good stewards of the land and nature.

What we can’t allow to happen is what occurred on the 120-acre farm that once was my grandfather’s. White silica sand was mined out of the ground and transported by truck to feed the fracking process being done in places like Pennsylvania to mine natural gas. The red arrow shows the area of my family farm in Illinois that was now mined-out farmland. The green area was saved only due to the fact of a 19th-century family cemetery being present.

Replay the presidential debate between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris to hear Trump state how wrong Harris was initially on the environmental effects of fracking, only to change her mind to be in favor. He even mentions it in his closing remarks. She did change her mind, but it must be noted that the technology also changed in about 2018 to allow brown sand, like you find in west Texas, to be used in place of the round ball barring type white silica sand in applications less than 800 feet deep. So much for the old Carpenter family farm mined out before August 2019 before mining in LaSalle County (Ill.) farmland essentially stopped.

Not much is being said about the new energy generation facility on Koch’s Lane just west of Ambiance. It looks like all the solar panels are in, as well as other equipment (maybe inverters). The lithium iron phosphate batteries likely need to come from China, so it will be interesting when the facility can take delivery. China is fourth in countries with the most lithium reserves behind Chile, Australia and Argentina.

We should be mindful of how Lithium is mined in places like China. This solar farm will be different in terms of most other solar farms, as it stores much of its energy in very large banks of these batteries and goes online only when high power usage requires help to reduce “brownouts” or voltage reduction, which causes more inefficient energy consumption.

I hope you find some of what I have written to be helpful. Try to balance your judgments to include considerations of making the best use of new technologies being developed by some of the smartest people in this world.

I think I understand what new electrical generation hardware placed in given areas means to people. A while back, I was not in favor of an ethanol plant being across the road from my front yard but may have considered at the time being bought out at 50% above market value of my home and the homes of my neighbors so people working at the plant could live in that housing close to work.

Now comes new efforts to build many new nuclear power plants in the U.S. They take great amounts of water to cool them, so planting them next to the Mississippi River and our community could very well happen.

The grants, largely awarded during former President Joe Biden’s final few months in the White House, were primarily for programs to capture carbon emissions and store them underground. Other targeted efforts span cleaner cement, natural gas and more.

Some of the 24 canceled awards include $500 million to Heidelberg Materials US, Inc.; $375 million to Eastman Chemical Company; $95 million to Nevada Gold Mines, LLC; and $270 million to Sutter CCUS, among others, according to a list provided by the Department of Energy. Sublime Systems, which lost an $87 million grant, was “surprised and disappointed,” the company said in a statement.

“Today’s action is bad for U.S. competitiveness in the global market and also directly contradictory to the administration’s stated goals of supporting energy production and environmental innovation,” said Conrad Schneider, a senior director at the Clean Air Task Force. It “undercuts U.S. competitiveness at a time when there is a growing global market for cleaner industrial products and technologies.”

The news was a swift follow-up to plans the Energy Department announced earlier this month to review 179 funded projects, totaling over $15 billion, that were awarded by the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations created under the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law.

It is part of Wright’s pledge to ensure “responsible” spending — aligning with the government’s broader efficiency and cost-cutting measures, such as those recommended by the Department of Government Efficiency, which has significantly impacted federal research, workers and agencies.

“While the previous administration failed to conduct a thorough financial review before signing away billions of taxpayer dollars, the Trump administration is doing our due diligence to ensure we are utilizing taxpayer dollars to strengthen our national security, bolster affordable, reliable energy sources and advance projects that generate the highest possible return on investment,” Wright said in Friday’s statement.

Moreover, the announcement marks the latest of the administration’s attacks on clean energy, broadly, and its effort to slash federal support for projects addressing climate change.

The Trump administration has taken an ax to Biden-era environmental ambitions, rolled back landmark regulations, withdrawn climate project funding, and instead bolstered support for oil and gas production in the name of an “American energy dominance” agenda.

Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, called the news “shortsighted.”

Carbon capture has been a controversial climate solution, as skeptics say it enables the continued burning of fossil fuels oil, coal and natural gas that emit planet-warming greenhouse gases — including carbon dioxide — and distracts from the need to cut ties with those energy sources altogether. Though investment in the technology has grown, it also remains challenging to scale.

Organizations quickly decried the secretary’s actions, stressing that the cancelations don’t align with the administration’s goals to bolster domestic manufacturing or energy independence.

Jessie Stolark, the executive director of the nonpartisan Carbon Capture Coalition, said the news “is a major step backward” for carbon management technologies, which are “crucial to meeting America’s growing demand for affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy.”

“These projects are not just reducing pollution, they are keeping the U.S. on the cutting edge of manufacturing technology,” said Mike Williams, senior fellow on the energy and environment team at public policy and advocacy group the Center for American Progress. “Canceling these important projects will raise energy prices for consumers and sacrifice thousands of high-quality union jobs, all because the president wants to curry favor with Big Oil.”

Evan Gillespie, partner at decarbonization organization, Industrious Labs, said the move dismantles the economy and the future of American manufacturing and its workforce.

“Killing these projects means more emissions, more pollution, and more people getting sick,” he said.

A team of scientists just solved a fusion energy problem that's held researchers back for nearly 70 years — and the fix could fast-track cheaper, cleaner electricity.

Fusion works by fusing atoms together to produce heat, just like the sun does. That heat can be used to make electricity without burning gas or coal and without creating long-lived nuclear waste. It's clean, safe, and virtually limitless.

But fusion depends on super-hot plasma trapped inside magnetic fields. And for decades, one problem has stayed unsolved: high-energy particles kept slipping through gaps in those magnetic fields, draining energy and killing the reaction.

Now, researchers at the University of Texas at Austin, Los Alamos National Lab, and Type One Energy say they've cracked it. Their new method pinpoints and fixes those ""holes"" using a faster and more accurate approach, reducing design time for fusion reactors by up to 90%.

""What's most exciting is that we're solving something that's been an open problem for almost 70 years,"" said lead researcher Josh Burby. ""It's a paradigm shift in how we design these reactors.""

This discovery could jumpstart the development of stellarators — a fusion reactor design known for reliability and safety. Until now, they've been slow to build because of their complex magnetic systems. This fix removes that roadblock.

It could also improve tokamak designs, which face different risks. In tokamaks, poorly contained particles can damage the reactor walls. The new method helps engineers map and avoid those failure points before they become dangerous.

""There is currently no practical way to find a theoretical answer to the alpha-particle confinement question without our results,"" Burby said. ""Direct application of Newton's laws is too expensive. Perturbation methods commit gross errors. Ours is the first theory that circumvents these pitfalls.""

Faster, safer design could lead to working reactors sooner than expected — a win for cities, power companies, and families stuck with rising energy costs. Fusion doesn't rely on mining or drilling, and once it's running, it's far cheaper to maintain than dirty fuels.

Fewer dirty power plants mean less heat-trapping pollution and cleaner air, especially for neighborhoods near industrial sites. That also means fewer asthma attacks, fewer ER visits, and healthier communities.

Until fusion reaches your block, the easiest way to save money and support clean energy is at home. Installing solar panels can bring your energy costs close to $0. EnergySage makes it easy to compare quotes from vetted local installers and save up to $10,000.

Type One Energy is already building next-generation reactors using this new approach. Other companies, like TAE Technologies and Commonwealth Fusion Systems, are racing toward similar goals.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/fusion-energyimage-recUC0zlgLPj0TxU3.jpg,N,,2025-05-31 16:07:20.294055

The grants, largely awarded during former President Joe Biden's final few months in the White House, were primarily for programs to capture carbon emissions and store them underground.
Sublime Systems, which lost an $87 million grant, was “surprised and disappointed,” the company said in a statement.
Moreover, the announcement marks the latest of the administration's attacks on clean energy, broadly, and its effort to slash federal support for projects addressing climate change.
“Killing these projects means more emissions, more pollution, and more people getting sick,” he said.","WASHINGTON — Energy Secretary Chris Wright said Friday he canceled nearly $4 billion in project grants, in another massive blow to clean energy and greenhouse gas emissions reduction efforts in the U.S. under President Donald Trump's administration.

The grants, largely awarded during former President Joe Biden's final few months in the White House, were primarily for programs to capture carbon emissions and store them underground. Other targeted efforts span cleaner cement, natural gas and more.

Some of the 24 canceled awards include $500 million to Heidelberg Materials US, Inc.; $375 million to Eastman Chemical Company; $95 million to Nevada Gold Mines, LLC; and $270 million to Sutter CCUS, among others, according to a list provided by the Department of Energy. Sublime Systems, which lost an $87 million grant, was “surprised and disappointed,” the company said in a statement.

“Today’s action is bad for U.S. competitiveness in the global market and also directly contradictory to the administration’s stated goals of supporting energy production and environmental innovation,” said Conrad Schneider, a senior director at the Clean Air Task Force. It “undercuts U.S. competitiveness at a time when there is a growing global market for cleaner industrial products and technologies.”

The news was a swift follow-up to plans the Energy Department announced earlier this month to review 179 funded projects, totaling over $15 billion, that were awarded by the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations created under the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law.

It is part of Wright's pledge to ensure “responsible” spending — aligning with the government's broader efficiency and cost-cutting measures, such as those recommended by the Department of Government Efficiency, which has significantly impacted federal research, workers and agencies.

“While the previous administration failed to conduct a thorough financial review before signing away billions of taxpayer dollars, the Trump administration is doing our due diligence to ensure we are utilizing taxpayer dollars to strengthen our national security, bolster affordable, reliable energy sources and advance projects that generate the highest possible return on investment,"" Wright said in Friday's statement.

Moreover, the announcement marks the latest of the administration's attacks on clean energy, broadly, and its effort to slash federal support for projects addressing climate change.

The Trump administration has taken an ax to Biden-era environmental ambitions, rolled back landmark regulations, withdrawn climate project funding, and instead bolstered support for oil and gas production in the name of an “American energy dominance” agenda.

Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, called the news “shortsighted.”

Carbon capture has been a controversial climate solution, as skeptics say it enables the continued burning of fossil fuels oil, coal and natural gas that emit planet-warming greenhouse gases — including carbon dioxide — and distracts from the need to cut ties with those energy sources altogether. Though investment in the technology has grown, it also remains challenging to scale.

Industry decries the news

Organizations quickly decried the secretary's actions, stressing that the cancelations don't align with the administration's goals to bolster domestic manufacturing or energy independence.

Jessie Stolark, the executive director of the nonpartisan Carbon Capture Coalition, said the news “is a major step backward"" for carbon management technologies, which are “crucial to meeting America’s growing demand for affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy.”

“These projects are not just reducing pollution, they are keeping the U.S. on the cutting edge of manufacturing technology,"" said Mike Williams, senior fellow on the energy and environment team at public policy and advocacy group the Center for American Progress. ""Canceling these important projects will raise energy prices for consumers and sacrifice thousands of high-quality union jobs, all because the president wants to curry favor with Big Oil.”

Evan Gillespie, partner at decarbonization organization, Industrious Labs, said the move dismantles the economy and the future of American manufacturing and its workforce.

The grants, largely awarded during former President Joe Biden's final few months in the White House, were primarily for programs to capture carbon emissions and store them underground.
Sublime Systems, which lost an $87 million grant, was “surprised and disappointed,” the company said in a statement.
Moreover, the announcement marks the latest of the administration's attacks on clean energy, broadly, and its effort to slash federal support for projects addressing climate change.
“Killing these projects means more emissions, more pollution, and more people getting sick,” he said.","WASHINGTON — Energy Secretary Chris Wright said Friday he canceled nearly $4 billion in project grants, in another massive blow to clean energy and greenhouse gas emissions reduction efforts in the U.S. under President Donald Trump's administration.

The grants, largely awarded during former President Joe Biden's final few months in the White House, were primarily for programs to capture carbon emissions and store them underground. Other targeted efforts span cleaner cement, natural gas and more.

Some of the 24 canceled awards include $500 million to Heidelberg Materials US, Inc.; $375 million to Eastman Chemical Company; $95 million to Nevada Gold Mines, LLC; and $270 million to Sutter CCUS, among others, according to a list provided by the Department of Energy. Sublime Systems, which lost an $87 million grant, was “surprised and disappointed,” the company said in a statement.

“Today’s action is bad for U.S. competitiveness in the global market and also directly contradictory to the administration’s stated goals of supporting energy production and environmental innovation,” said Conrad Schneider, a senior director at the Clean Air Task Force. It “undercuts U.S. competitiveness at a time when there is a growing global market for cleaner industrial products and technologies.”

The news was a swift follow-up to plans the Energy Department announced earlier this month to review 179 funded projects, totaling over $15 billion, that were awarded by the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations created under the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law.

It is part of Wright's pledge to ensure “responsible” spending — aligning with the government's broader efficiency and cost-cutting measures, such as those recommended by the Department of Government Efficiency, which has significantly impacted federal research, workers and agencies.

“While the previous administration failed to conduct a thorough financial review before signing away billions of taxpayer dollars, the Trump administration is doing our due diligence to ensure we are utilizing taxpayer dollars to strengthen our national security, bolster affordable, reliable energy sources and advance projects that generate the highest possible return on investment,"" Wright said in Friday's statement.

Moreover, the announcement marks the latest of the administration's attacks on clean energy, broadly, and its effort to slash federal support for projects addressing climate change.

The Trump administration has taken an ax to Biden-era environmental ambitions, rolled back landmark regulations, withdrawn climate project funding, and instead bolstered support for oil and gas production in the name of an “American energy dominance” agenda.

Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, called the news “shortsighted.”

Carbon capture has been a controversial climate solution, as skeptics say it enables the continued burning of fossil fuels oil, coal and natural gas that emit planet-warming greenhouse gases — including carbon dioxide — and distracts from the need to cut ties with those energy sources altogether. Though investment in the technology has grown, it also remains challenging to scale.

Industry decries the news

Organizations quickly decried the secretary's actions, stressing that the cancelations don't align with the administration's goals to bolster domestic manufacturing or energy independence.

Jessie Stolark, the executive director of the nonpartisan Carbon Capture Coalition, said the news “is a major step backward"" for carbon management technologies, which are “crucial to meeting America’s growing demand for affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy.”

“These projects are not just reducing pollution, they are keeping the U.S. on the cutting edge of manufacturing technology,"" said Mike Williams, senior fellow on the energy and environment team at public policy and advocacy group the Center for American Progress. ""Canceling these important projects will raise energy prices for consumers and sacrifice thousands of high-quality union jobs, all because the president wants to curry favor with Big Oil.”

Evan Gillespie, partner at decarbonization organization, Industrious Labs, said the move dismantles the economy and the future of American manufacturing and its workforce.

The Carbon Capture Coalition is urging lawmakers to restore transferability now that the bill has moved from the House to the Senate.","Dig down about a mile or two in parts of the United States and you’ll start to see the remains of an ancient ocean. The shells of long dead sea creatures are compressed into white limestone, surrounding brine aquifers with a higher salt content than the Atlantic Ocean.

Last summer, Exxon Mobil sponsored week-long camps to teach grade school students from Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi about the virtues of these aquifers, specifically their ability to serve as carbon capture and sequestration wells, where oil, gas, and heavy industry can bury harmful emissions deep underground. In one exercise, students were given 20 minutes to build a model reservoir out of vegetable oil, Play-Doh, pasta, and uncooked beans. Whoever could keep the most vegetable oil (meant to represent liquified carbon dioxide) in their aquifer, won.

This kind of down-home carbon capture boosterism is a relatively new development for the oil and gas giant. Over recent years, Exxon Mobil and other fossil fuel companies have spent millions lobbying for government support of what they see as industry-friendly green technology, most prominently carbon capture and storage, which many scientists and environmental activists have argued is ineffective and distracts from eliminating fossil fuel operations in the first place. According to Exxon’s website, it’s evidence that they are leading “the biggest energy transition in history.”

Now that Congress has turned its attention to rolling back government spending on renewable energy, it appears that most of the climate “solutions” being left off the chopping block are the ones favored by carbon-intensive companies like Exxon. Corporate tax breaks for carbon capture and storage, for instance, were one of the few things left untouched when House Republicans passed a budget bill on May 22 that effectively gutted the Inflation Reduction Act, or IRA, the Biden administration’s signature climate legislation. What remained of the IRA’s clean energy tax credits were incentives for nuclear, so-called clean fuels like ethanol, and carbon capture. When the IRA was passed in 2022, there was immediate backlash against the provisions for carbon capture.

“Essentially, we, the taxpayers, are subsidizing a private sewer system for oil and gas,” said Sandra Steingraber, a senior scientist at the nonprofit Science and Environmental Health Network.

The tax credits for nuclear power plants, which produce energy without emitting greenhouse gases, are meant to spur what President Donald Trump hopes will be an “energy renaissance,” bolstered by a flurry of pro-nuclear executive orders he issued a day after the budget bill cleared the House. Projects will be able to use the tax credits if they begin construction by 2031; wind and solar companies, however, will lose access to tax credits unless they begin construction within 60 days of Trump signing the bill, and are fully up and running by 2028.

That the carbon capture tax credit was never in danger of being revoked is a testament to its importance to the oil and gas industry, said Jim Walsh, the policy director at the nonprofit Food and Water Watch. “The major beneficiaries of these tax credits are oil and gas companies and big agricultural interests.”

The carbon capture tax credit was first established in 2008, but the subsidies were more than doubled when it was tacked on to the IRA in order to get former senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia’s vote. Companies now receive $60 for every ton of CO2 captured and used to drive oil out of the ground (a process known as “enhanced oil recovery”) and up to $85 for a ton of CO2 that is permanently stored. As roughly 60 percent of captured C02 in the United States is used for enhanced oil recovery, detractors see the tax credit as something of a devil’s bargain, a provision that props up an industry at taxpayer expense.

How much carbon is actually captured by these projects is also a matter of debate. The tax credit requires companies that claim it to self-report how much CO2 they inject to the Internal Revenue Service. The Environmental Protection Agency, meanwhile, is in charge of tracking leaks. There are tax penalties if captured carbon ends up leaking, but those penalties only apply if the leaks occur in the first three years after injection. Holding companies accountable is made more complicated by the fact that tax returns are confidential, and Walsh cautions that there is very little communication between the EPA and the IRS. Oversight is “very, very minimal,” added Anika Juhn, an energy data analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, a research firm.

“You can keep some really played out oil fields going for a long time, and you can get the public to pay for it,” said Carolyn Raffensberger, the executive director of the Science and Environmental Health Network, explaining the potential impact of the budget bill. “So the argument is, ‘This is a win for the climate, it’s a win for energy dominance.’ [But] it’s really a budget buster with no guardrails at all.”

Existing carbon-capture facilities have been plagued by technical and financial issues. The country’s first commercial carbon capture plant in Decatur, Illinois, sprung two leaks last year directly under Lake Decatur, which is the town’s main source of drinking water. When concentrated CO2 hits water it turns into carbonic acid, which then leaches heavy metals from rocks within the aquifer and poisons the water. Although a certain level of public health concerns come with many emerging technologies, critics point out that all of this risk is being taken for a technology that has not been proven to work at scale, and may actually increase emissions by incentivizing more oil and gas production. It could also strain the existing electrical grid — outfitting a natural gas or coal plant with carbon capture equipment can suck up about 15 to 25 percent of the plant’s power.

The tax credits exist “to pollute and confuse people,” said Mark Jacobsen, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Stanford University, who has argued that there is essentially no reasonable use for carbon capture. They “increase people’s [energy] costs and do nothing for the climate.”

But the technology does have its defenders among scientists. The 2022 report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change called an increase in carbon capture technology “unavoidable” if countries want to reach net-zero emissions. Jessie Stolark, the executive director of the Carbon Capture Coalition, an umbrella organization of fossil fuel companies, unions, and environmental groups, contends that arguments like Jacobsen’s unnecessarily set the technology against renewables. “We need all the solutions in the toolkit,” she said. “We’re not saying don’t deploy these other technologies. We see this very much as a complementary and supportive piece in the broader decarbonization toolkit.”

Stolark said that carbon capture didn’t make it out of the budget process entirely unscathed, as the bill specified that companies could no longer sell carbon capture tax credits. So-called “transferability” — the ability to sell these tax credits on the open market — has been invaluable to small energy startups that have struggled to secure financing in their early stages, according to Stolark. The Carbon Capture Coalition is urging lawmakers to restore transferability now that the bill has moved from the House to the Senate.

Still, the kinds of companies likely to claim carbon capture tax credits — often major players in oil and gas, ammonia, steel, and other heavy industries — are less likely to rely on transferability than more modest companies (often providers of renewable energy), whose smaller tax bills makes it harder for them to realize the value of their respective tax credits.

“A lot of the factories, the power plants, the industrial facilities deploying within the next ten years or so, are expected to be these really big [facilities] with the big tax burdens,” said Dan O’Brien, a senior modeling analyst at Energy Innovations, a clean energy think tank based in San Francisco. “They’re not the type of smaller producers — like small solar companies — that are reliant on transferability in order to monetize the tax credit.”",https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/CCS-Well.jpeg?quality=75&strip=all,N,,2025-05-31 15:06:25.482925

PennEnvironment Research & Policy Center and Evergreen Action have released a new interactive map that highlights federal clean energy investments in Pennsylvania.

The map tracks renewable energy projects across the state that utilize federal funds from the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), allowing users to see the businesses, houses of worship, and public buildings pursuing projects ranging from installing solar panels and increasing energy efficiency to monitoring air quality and planting trees.

“Federal investments are fueling growth in local industries, creating new jobs, and laying the groundwork for long-term prosperity,” said Julia Kortrey, Deputy State Policy Director of Evergreen Action. “Pennsylvanians deserve an affordable, clean energy future, and these funds are making that future a reality.”

The release also provides Pennsylvanians interested in switching to clean energy alternatives with a “clean energy home toolkit,” a resource guide on how to use rebates and tax incentives from the IRA. In the first year after the IRA’s implementation of tax credits for individuals, businesses, and nonprofits, 160,000 Pennsylvanians saved more than $260 million.

“With these tax credits and incentives there’s never been a better time to go solar or get a heat pump or [electric vehicle],” said Ellie Kearns, PennEnvironment’s Climate and Clean Energy Advocate. Although up-front costs can be high, the incentives and credits available in the clean energy home toolkit can greatly reduce the costs of switching to renewable energy. At the same time, energy efficient upgrades will “pay for themselves” in the long run, “especially as utility bills continue to rise,” added Kearns.

The tools provided by PennEnvironment and Evergreen indicate reasons for optimism regarding the future of clean energy in Pennsylvania. According to PennEnvironment Deputy Director Flora Cardoni, “Pennsylvania has an immense, largely untapped opportunity when it comes to clean energy. And we have the technology to build a clean energy future today.” Cardoni pointed to data from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory showing that, if Pennsylvania continues to pursue clean energy projects, the state has the technical potential to generate five times its electricity demand in 2020 from the sun and 15% of its annual electricity demand from the wind.

Currently, however, Pennsylvania lags behind other states in growing renewable energy generation. For example, while Pennsylvania increased clean energy production by 57 percent between 2015 and 2024, it ranked 49th out of the 50 states by percent increase in total solar, wind and geothermal generation during that period. By contrast, neighboring states including New York, New Jersey, Maryland, and Ohio greatly outperformed the Commonwealth in increasing their generation of solar power.

There is, however, a plan in the pipeline which would help bring Pennsylvania back on par with its neighbors. In April, Governor Shapiro unveiled his Lightning Plan, a six-part legislative package which would “put the Keystone State on the path towards a new, cleaner energy future.” The various pieces of legislation contained in this plan would require utility companies supplying electricity in Pennsylvania to get 35 percent of their power from renewable energy sources by 2035, streamline the process to approve new clean energy projects, create programs to help Pennsylvanians switch to solar power and lower pollution, and create more tax breaks and incentives for switching to renewable energy.

READ: Pennsylvanians Won Important Victories for Clean Energy and the Environment in 2024

Polling shows that there is widespread bipartisan support in Pennsylvania for increasing renewable energy production. According to a poll conducted by Global Strategy Group in 2024, 93 percent of Democrats, 84 percent of independents, and 59 percent of Republicans support increasing the use of wind and solar energy.

The use of federal tax credits and incentives to promote a transition to clean energy, including those deployed under the IRA, enjoys even broader support. Another 2024 poll showed that “87 percent of Americans support federal incentives to deploy solar and energy storage, including 78 percent of 2020 Trump voters.”

Despite this bipartisan support, federal tax credits and incentives are on the chopping block during the ongoing congressional budget negotiations. “If the tax credits are repealed,” said Kearns, “we expect that many individuals, businesses, and non-profits will slow or even stop their efforts to install solar, buy EVs, [or] switch to heat pumps because the price becomes out of reach for at least the near future.”

In addition, the Trump administration is attempting to claw back congressionally approved grants distributed under the IRA to state and local governments, businesses, and farmers. If these efforts are successful, many of the projects illuminated in this new interactive map will likely be cancelled.

“There is some grant money that has already been dispersed and even used already, but there are also grants that have been paused or even attempted to be rolled back,” said Kearns. “The Shapiro administration has been suing so that Pennsylvania gets the money that it was allocated, but the fate of a lot of this funding is still murky and unknown.”

Red states and congressional districts have benefitted the most from the IRA since its passage: More than 110 major clean energy and clean vehicle factories and other projects are in development or have already broken ground in the southeastern states. Twenty-one house Republicans, including Reps. Ryan Mackenzie and Rob Bresnahan from Pennsylvania, have signed onto a letter asking congressional leaders not to repeal tax credits, but the future of these clean energy incentives remains uncertain.

PennEnvironment advocates have urged a call to action for Pennsylvanians who want to protect clean energy investments. “Pennsylvanians … should call their Congressmember and Senators and ask them to maintain all clean energy and energy efficiency tax credits, rebates, and incentives so those who want to can choose clean energy,” said Kearns.

Cardoni added that residents should also urger theur state lawmakers to pass Gov. Shapiro’s Lightning Plan and “prioritize other policies that would increase the amount of clean, renewable energy like wind and solar in the state and that would improve energy efficiency and conservation.”",https://982e8d80.delivery.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Clean-energy_Pennsylvania.jpg,N,,2025-05-31 11:03:25.440552

From a purely business perspective, the elimination of Energy Star isn’t merely about labels on appliances; it directly impacts operational costs, performance consistency and market competitiveness.

The Energy Star program stands as a remarkably successful example of a public-private partnership that delivers substantial, measurable benefits to American consumers and businesses and the environment.

Energy Star has long provided clear and reliable standards that have enabled small businesses to make informed investments in energy-efficient products. This clarity translates into direct financial savings, reducing energy expenses by up to 30 percent according to the Environmental Protection Agency’s own data.

Especially for small businesses operating on tight margins, these savings aren’t trivial — they represent critical capital that can be reinvested into core business activities such as product development, hiring additional employees or expanding market reach.

Beyond immediate cost reductions, Energy Star has established an essential standardization in measuring and reporting appliance and equipment performance. Small business owners have relied on these standards to make purchases confidently, knowing they are investing in products that perform efficiently and reliably over their lifespan.

Without the program, businesses face increased uncertainty, leading to potentially costly investments in substandard products that fail to deliver the promised efficiency and reliability.

Consumer trust, a crucial component of market competitiveness for all businesses, is also at risk. The label is widely recognized and trusted by a majority of American households, signaling verified quality and efficiency.

Its absence would likely result in an influx of misleading performance claims and unverified efficiency assertions, damaging consumer confidence and creating a competitive environment where cutting corners becomes commonplace. This race to the bottom ultimately harms businesses committed to genuine quality and performance standards.

Moreover, from an economic standpoint, the return on investment provided by the program speaks for itself — every federal dollar spent on the program results in approximately $350 in cost savings for businesses and consumers alike. Small businesses particularly benefit from these savings, which enhance profitability, improve cash flow and bolster overall economic resilience.

The decision to defund Energy Star appears driven less by fiscal prudence and more by an ideological stance against terms like “climate change” and “sustainability.” However, dismissing these concepts as mere political rhetoric overlooks the substantial and proven economic benefits they offer businesses and consumers.

Efficiency and sustainability are practical, financially responsible strategies that reduce operational costs, strengthen consumer confidence and enhance long-term business viability.

Ultimately, maintaining funding for Energy Star isn’t about ideological debates, it’s a smart business decision that helps American businesses and consumers. Preserving a program that has demonstrably reduced costs, standardized performance and protected consumer trust should be a straightforward choice for any administration committed to the economic health and competitiveness of American small businesses.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/05/energy-star_05072025_AP_AP25127640518935.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-05-31 14:06:23.101246

Activity in state legislatures — and competition for data centers — has been brisk in recent months, amid an intensifying buildout of the energy-hungry data centers and a search for new sites that was ignited by the late 2022 debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT.

Many states are offering financial incentives worth tens of millions of dollars. In some cases, those incentives are winning approval, but only after a fight or efforts to require data centers to pay for their own electricity or meet energy efficiency standards.

Some state lawmakers have contested the incentives in places where a heavy influx of massive data centers has caused friction with neighboring communities. In large part, the fights revolve around the things that tech companies and data center developers seem to most want: large tracts of land, tax breaks and huge volumes of electricity and water.

And their needs are exploding in size: from dozens of megawatts to hundreds of megawatts and from dozens of acres up to hundreds of acres for large-scale data centers sometimes called a hyperscaler.

While critics say data centers employ relatively few people and pack little long-term job-creation punch, their advocates say they require a huge number of construction jobs to build, spend enormous sums on goods and local vendors and generate strong tax revenues for local governments.

In Pennsylvania, lawmakers are writing legislation to fast-track permitting for data centers. The state is viewed as an up-and-coming data center destination, but there is also a sense that Pennsylvania is missing out on billions of dollars in investment that's landing in other states.

“Pennsylvania has companies that are interested, we have a labor force that is capable and we have a lot of water and natural gas,” said state Rep. Eric Nelson. ""That’s the winning combination. We just have a bureaucratic process that won’t open its doors.”

It's been a big year for data centers

Kansas approved a new sales tax exemption on goods to build and equip data centers, while Kentucky and Arkansas expanded pre-existing exemptions so that more projects will qualify.

Michigan approved one that carries some protections, including requirements to use municipal utility water and clean energy, meet energy-efficiency measures and ensure that it pays for its own electricity.

Such tax exemptions are now so widespread — about three dozen states have some version of it — that it is viewed as a must-have for a state to compete.

“It’s often a nonstarter if you don’t have them, for at least the hyperscalers,” said Andy Cvengros, who helps lead the data center practice at commercial real estate giant JLL. “It’s just such a massive impact on the overall spend of the data center.”

Zoning, energy fights often frustrate developers

In West Virginia, lawmakers approved a bill to create “microgrid” districts free from local zoning and electric rate regulations where data centers can procure power from standalone power plants.

Gov. Patrick Morrisey, a Republican, called the bill his “landmark policy proposal” for 2025 to put West Virginia “in a class of its own to attract new data centers and information technology companies.”

Utah and Oklahoma passed laws to make it easier for data center developers to procure their own power supply without going through the grid while Mississippi rolled out tens of millions of dollars in incentives last year to land a pair of Amazon data centers.

In South Carolina, Gov. Henry McMaster signed legislation earlier this month that eased regulations to speed up power plant construction to meet demand from data centers, including a massive Facebook facility.

The final bill was fought by some lawmakers who say they worried about data centers using disproportionate amounts of water, taking up large tracts of land and forcing regular ratepayers to finance the cost of new power plants.

“I do not like that we’re making customers pay for two power plants when they only need one,” Senate Majority Leader Shane Massey told colleagues during floor debate.

Still, state Sen. Russell Ott suggested that data centers should be viewed like any other electricity customer because they reflect a society that is “addicted” to electricity and are “filling that need and that desire of what we all want. And we're all guilty of it. We’re all responsible for it.”

Some lawmakers are hesitant

In data center hotspots, some lawmakers are pushing back.

Lawmakers in Oregon are advancing legislation to order utility regulators to ensure data centers pay the cost of power plants and power lines necessary to serve them.

Georgia lawmakers are debating a similar bill.

In Virginia, the most heavily developed data center zone in the U.S., Gov. Glenn Youngkin vetoed a bill that would have forced more disclosures from data center developers about their site's noise pollution and water use.

In Texas, which endured a deadly winter blackout in 2021, lawmakers are wrestling with how to protect the state's electric grid from fast-growing data center demand.

Lawmakers still want to attract data centers, but a bill that would speed up direct hookups between data centers and power plants has provisions that are drawing protests from business groups.

Those provisions would give utility regulators new authority to approve those agreements and order big electric users such as data centers to switch to backup generators in a power emergency.

Walt Baum, the CEO of Powering Texans, which represents competitive power plant owners, warned lawmakers that those provisions might be making data center developers hesitant to do business in Texas.

“You’ve seen a lot of new announcements in other states and over the last several months and not as much here in Texas,"" Baum told House members during a May 7 committee hearing. ""I think everybody right now is in a waiting pattern and I worry that we could be losing to other states while that waiting pattern is happening.”

But the grid was missing 4,500 megawatts from “unplanned outages” last weekend, MISO wrote.
The unplanned outages that MISO described shed more light on why residents faced forced blackouts.
Entergy has said its internal projections didn’t show the need for forced outages, and that MISO didn’t give it any advance warning.
Andy Kowalczyk, transmission director for the Southern Renewable Energy Association, said the scale of the unplanned outages — 4,500 megawatts — is huge.","Louisiana’s electric grid was missing a huge amount of power last weekend because of unplanned outages at power plants, contributing to the grid operator’s decision to order forced blackouts to avoid a “catastrophic” blackout similar to a recent crisis in Spain and Portugal, according to an internal memo.

The Mid-Continent Independent System Operator, which operates the electric grid in a large swath of middle America, abruptly ordered Entergy and Cleco to “shed load” last Sunday or initiate forced blackouts for about 100,000 in the New Orleans region. The event has raised concerns from regulators and elected officials, who have scheduled multiple upcoming hearings about why the public wasn’t notified sooner and how the customers who had the lights turned off were chosen.

The operator, known as MISO, wrote in a memo shared with some government officials Friday that it was aware of power plants that were down for routine maintenance, which it said is normal in the spring. The Times-Picayune obtained a copy of the memo.

But the grid was missing 4,500 megawatts from “unplanned outages” last weekend, MISO wrote. That’s enough electricity to theoretically power several million homes.

It says a “major transmission line” was also out of service because of tornadoes in March. And temperatures were higher than normal over the weekend.

Asked about the memo on Friday, MISO spokesperson Brandon Morris said there were seven total unplanned outages leading up to the blackout, including a large power station that went offline last Wednesday, presumably the River Bend nuclear plant. MISO doesn’t share unit-specific information, but Entergy’s River Bend was shut down on that date because of a leak and didn’t come back on for five days. It’s not clear which other power plants were out, but Louisiana’s utilities rely heavily on natural gas to generate electricity.

The unplanned outages that MISO described shed more light on why residents faced forced blackouts. But they also raise more questions about who owns the generators that went down and why they were offline.

Entergy New Orleans spokesperson Beau Tidwell said in an email Friday that Entergy had three units on planned maintenance outages before the River Bend unit went down, and that those were accounted for by MISO.

He said ""other non-Entergy owned units were also experiencing outages during the event.""

""As we have noted, Entergy's models did not show the need for load shed, but we recognize that MISO's models have a broader view of the grid due to its status as the regional transmission operator,"" Tidwell said.

The transmission line that was out was an Entergy line that was destroyed by tornadoes in March and was still being rebuilt. Tidwell said Entergy had developed a ""reconfiguration protocol"" while the line was down.

Some officials have criticized MISO’s lack of advance notice, which could have allowed Entergy or regulators to curtail power usage before requiring blackouts. Instead, city council members said Entergy only received a three-minute warning before having to cut power.

Logan Burke, head of the Alliance for Affordable Energy, said Friday that the huge amount of power being offline helps explain the load shed.

“The next question is, who owns that generation?” Burke said in an email. “Investigations are needed to identify why that much power dropped offline unexpectedly.”

MISO was managing the problems until Sunday, when transmission lines became overloaded, risking “cascading outages,” according to the memo.

“Absent shedding load, a catastrophic blackout (as Spain and Portugal recently experienced) could have occurred, causing significant damage to the transmission system in Southern Louisiana,” the memo said.

Entergy has said its internal projections didn’t show the need for forced outages, and that MISO didn’t give it any advance warning. In an email to customers Thursday, Entergy said it “regrets that Entergy was not provided with enough prior notice of the outage to prepare our customers for the potential loss of power.”

Entergy has long faced accusations that it does not have adequate transmission lines — which carry bulk power long distances — in its service territory. Amid scrutiny from the Department of Justice for allegedly wielding its monopoly to crowd out competitors, Entergy joined MISO in 2013. MISO directs where power flows and operates a wholesale market for the sale of bulk power.

Andy Kowalczyk, transmission director for the Southern Renewable Energy Association, said the scale of the unplanned outages — 4,500 megawatts — is huge.

When the grid loses large amounts of power, it can create instability on transmission lines, which get overheated if there’s too much demand and not enough power, he said. If Entergy had more transmission capacity in the region, Kowalczyk said power may have been able to more easily flow, stabilizing the grid.

“We had power locked up in Mississippi. We had power locked up north of Louisiana. It had no way to get where it needed to go,” he said. “Events like this are a reminder of how far behind MISO South is on planning. They’re about 10 years late.”",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/nola.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/0/80/08016498-37e6-11ee-a8fa-17264d73953b/64d58e69c6d05.image.jpg?crop=1920%2C1008%2C0%2C35&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-05-31 13:09:51.185799

Thus, it makes economic sense to continue incentivizing clean energy projects.","Clean energy investments in the U.S. have amounted to $1 trillion over the past six years, resulting in boosts for the environment and for investors.

This ""trillion-dollar win,"" as energy research nonprofit RMI called it, created over 300,000 new jobs between 2018 and 2024, spanning both the first Trump administration and the following Biden administration.

Both consumers and companies have increasingly invested in eco-friendly initiatives, demonstrating how going green is good for business. Federal and state governments have encouraged this by creating incentives for clean energy projects.

The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which was passed in 2022, included Congress's largest investment in climate action. RMI reported that the IRA led to a tripling in quarterly clean energy technology investments over the past few years.

High-profile energy projects have cropped up in various states since the IRA's passage. For example, the Qcells solar panel factory in Dalton, Georgia, created 2,500 new jobs, with another 4,000 pending. Another solar manufacturing facility, First Solar, opened in Trinity, Alabama, last September and is expected to add 800 employees.

However, the future of these projects is uncertain because the Trump administration has announced intentions to roll back policies supporting them. This has caused some companies to suspend or slow down their investments.

Investment in clean energy helps protect the planet while creating new jobs for American workers. These projects have benefited red and blue states alike, with Republican voting states receiving slightly more, with 64% of new investments, according to RMI. Thus, it makes economic sense to continue incentivizing clean energy projects.

It can be difficult to find the right businesses to invest in, especially if you want your financial decisions to align with your values.

Avoiding greenwashing is another challenge in harnessing your money for good. But with a little research on investing in clean economy stocks or upgrading your 401(k), you can make your money speak for you.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/trillion-dollar-winimage-recLmcoN5jsFE0Ua4.jpg,N,,2025-05-31 13:09:08.657613

Energy Secretary Chris Wright said Friday he canceled nearly $4 billion in project grants, in another massive blow to clean energy and greenhouse gas emissions reduction efforts in the U.S. under President Donald Trump’s administration.

The grants, largely awarded during former President Joe Biden’s final few months in the White House, were primarily for programs to capture carbon emissions and store them underground. Other targeted efforts span cleaner cement, natural gas and more.

Some of the 24 canceled awards include $500 million to Heidelberg Materials US, Inc.; $375 million to Eastman Chemical Company; $95 million to Nevada Gold Mines, LLC; and $270 million to Sutter CCUS, among others, according to a list provided by the Department of Energy. Sublime Systems, which lost an $87 million grant, was “surprised and disappointed,” the company said in a statement.

“Today’s action is bad for U.S. competitiveness in the global market and also directly contradictory to the administration’s stated goals of supporting energy production and environmental innovation,” said Conrad Schneider, a senior director at the Clean Air Task Force. It “undercuts U.S. competitiveness at a time when there is a growing global market for cleaner industrial products and technologies.”

The news was a swift follow-up to plans the Energy Department announced earlier this month to review 179 funded projects, totaling over $15 billion, that were awarded by the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations created under the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law.

It is part of Wright’s pledge to ensure “responsible” spending — aligning with the government’s broader efficiency and cost-cutting measures, such as those recommended by the Department of Government Efficiency, which has significantly impacted federal research, workers and agencies.

“While the previous administration failed to conduct a thorough financial review before signing away billions of taxpayer dollars, the Trump administration is doing our due diligence to ensure we are utilizing taxpayer dollars to strengthen our national security, bolster affordable, reliable energy sources and advance projects that generate the highest possible return on investment,” Wright said in Friday’s statement.

Moreover, the announcement marks the latest of the administration’s attacks on clean energy, broadly, and its effort to slash federal support for projects addressing climate change.

The Trump administration has taken an ax to Biden-era environmental ambitions, rolled back landmark regulations, withdrawn climate project funding, and instead bolstered support for oil and gas production in the name of an “American energy dominance” agenda.

Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, called the news “shortsighted.”

Carbon capture has been a controversial climate solution, as skeptics say it enables the continued burning of fossil fuels oil, coal and natural gas that emit planet-warming greenhouse gases — including carbon dioxide — and distracts from the need to cut ties with those energy sources altogether. Though investment in the technology has grown, it also remains challenging to scale.

Industry decries the news

Organizations quickly decried the secretary’s actions, stressing that the cancelations don’t align with the administration’s goals to bolster domestic manufacturing or energy independence.

Jessie Stolark, the executive director of the nonpartisan Carbon Capture Coalition, said the news “is a major step backward” for carbon management technologies, which are “crucial to meeting America’s growing demand for affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy.”

“These projects are not just reducing pollution, they are keeping the U.S. on the cutting edge of manufacturing technology,” said Mike Williams, senior fellow on the energy and environment team at public policy and advocacy group the Center for American Progress. “Canceling these important projects will raise energy prices for consumers and sacrifice thousands of high-quality union jobs, all because the president wants to curry favor with Big Oil.”

Evan Gillespie, partner at decarbonization organization, Industrious Labs, said the move dismantles the economy and the future of American manufacturing and its workforce.

“Killing these projects means more emissions, more pollution, and more people getting sick,” he said.

As per the case of Seven County Infrastructure Coalition v. Eagle County, Colorado, a proposed railroad project would run nearly 90 miles through the state Utah, connecting a remote region rich in oil to a more central rail network to simplify the transport of crude oil.

The Supreme Court held that the Surface Transportation Board (STB) was not required to consider certain environmental effects of the operation and construction of a proposed railway route. The Supreme Court determined the D.C. Circuit failed to provide appropriate deference to the STB under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and had “incorrectly interpreted NEPA to require the STB to consider the environmental effects of upstream and downstream projects that are separate in time or place” (specifically oil drilling in Utah and oil production in the Gulf region) that might result from construction of the railway. NEPA is an environmental law designed to promote the enhancement of the environment, signed by President Richard Nixon, and considered one of the foundational environmental laws formed at the beginning of the modern environmental movement.

The Supreme Court’s decision is a setback for environmentalists, and President Donald Trump has criticized the government’s environmental review process as too cumbersome.

Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh explained in the Court’s opinion, “NEPA imposes no substantive environmental obligations or restrictions” on the board or on any other federal agency.

NEPA often hinders land development, as environmental groups or citizens opposing projects have the ability to sue, claiming that the STB that must approve the project did not prepare an adequate environmental impact statement.

“Under NEPA, agencies must consider the environmental impacts for which their decisions would be responsible,” wrote Sonia Sotomayor, Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, in the Court’s opinion. “Here, the board correctly determined it would not be responsible for the consequences of oil production upstream or downstream from the railway because it could not lawfully consider those consequences as part of the approval process.”

In terms of future rural land development, the decision handed down in Seven County Infrastructure Coalition v. Eagle County, Colorado could impact the future of the U.S. Department of Housing & Urban Development (HUD) and U.S. Department of the Interior’s (DOI) Joint Task Force on Federal Land for Housing. The Joint Task Force is an initiative that identifies underutilized federal lands for residential development, streamlines land transfer processes, and promotes policies that increase the availability of affordable housing.

“This partnership will identify underutilized federal land suitable for residential development and streamline the land transfer process,” explained DOI Secretary Doug Burgum in a March announcement. “It will also promote policies to increase the availability of affordable housing, while balancing important environmental and land use considerations.”

The Joint Task Force on Federal Land for Housing will streamline regulatory processes so building on federal lands is not held up by environmental reviews, transfer protocols and other priorities.

“This is about more than building houses,” wrote the Secretaries in the Wall Street Journal. “We want to build hope. Overlooked rural and tribal communities will be a focus of this joint agreement. We are going to invest in America’s many forgotten communities. As we enter the Golden Age promised by President Trump, this partnership will change how we use public resources.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright said his department decided to cancel 24 grants issued by the Biden administration because those projects were not economically viable and did not meet the nation's energy needs.

“While the previous administration failed to conduct a thorough financial review before signing away billions of taxpayer dollars, the Trump administration is doing our due diligence to ensure we are utilizing taxpayer dollars to strengthen our national security, bolster affordable, reliable energy sources and advance projects that generate the highest possible return on investment,” Wright said. “Today, we are acting in the best interest of the American people by canceling these 24 awards.”

Timothy Winters, president and CEO of Western New York Energy, did not return a request for comment on the Energy Department's move. But Juliette Strasser, communications and policy director for Skyven Technologies, the Texas-based company that partnered with Western New York Energy on the project, said the firm was disappointed to hear of the grant terminations.

""Skyven’s technology is cutting-edge and positions America for global leadership in industrial steam generation,"" she said. ""The Skyven portfolio of projects advance the DOE's and current administration’s goals to unleash American energy dominance, reduce energy costs and improve competitiveness for American manufacturers, support grid reliability, create American jobs and reduce the cost of American household goods.""

Strasser also indicated that the grant termination might not spell the end of the effort in Medina.

""We are reviewing the appeal process and will continue our efforts to increase efficiency and reduce operating costs for American manufacturers,"" she said.

Skyven announced last March that it had won $145 million in federal funding for its industrial decarbonization efforts. And last September, Skyven announced that it will install the largest-ever steam-generating heat pump at Western New York Energy, which produces ethanol and employs about 60 people, according to its website.

The steam pump technology would reduce the carbon dioxide output of the Medina facility by 20,000 metric tons annually, which would be equivalent to removing 4,300 vehicles from the road, Skyven said.

“By integrating Skyven’s cutting-edge Arcturus technology, we are taking significant strides in improving our community’s air quality by reducing our carbon footprint and improving our operational efficiencies,"" Winters said in Skyven's announcement of the program.

Told that the grant had been rescinded, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, said: ""This over $15 million federal grant for Skyven was promised to the community to help create new good-paying jobs and help reduce energy costs by shifting to steam production to help produce cheaper electricity ... This investment would have reduced the Medina plant’s expensive natural gas costs by up to 20%, all while making the community cleaner by reducing reliance on fossil fuels.""

Rep. Claudia Tenney, a Republican whose sprawling district includes Medina, did not return a request for comment.

""I hope Congresswoman Tenney will join me in denouncing this harmful cut by the Trump administration that will hurt local jobs and raise energy costs here in Orleans County,"" Schumer said.

In its list of grants that it was rescinding, the Department of Energy did not mention Western New York Energy. But it listed Skyven, the amount of the grant and the fact that it was awarded to a facility in Medina.

In its news release announcing the cancellation of the grants, the Department of Energy said it was primarily targeting carbon capture and sequestration and decarbonization initiatives. Such initiatives are part of the fight against climate change, given that scientists regard carbon dioxide as the main greenhouse gas that's warming the planet.

US FEDERAL AGENCIES TO 'UNLEASH' COAL ENERGY AFTER BIDEN 'STIFLED' IT: 'MINE, BABY, MINE'

The cuts include nearly $332 million pulled from a project at ExxonMobil's Baytown, Texas, refinery complex, $500 million to Heidelberg Materials in Louisiana and $375 million to Eastman Chemical Company in Longview, Texas.

Carbon capture, often referred to as carbon capture and storage (CCS), is a climate change mitigation technology designed to prevent carbon dioxide emissions from entering the atmosphere or from the pollution streams of facilities, including refineries and plants that burn coal and make ethanol, for storage underground.

Climate change activists claim human-produced carbon emissions cause the earth to warm. Trump has long dismissed the theory and has often referred to progressive climate and energy policies as the ""Green New Scam,"" a play on the ""Green New Deal,"" a sweeping climate and economic proposal championed by progressive Democrats like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.

Environmental groups focused on energy decried the cuts. Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, said the move was short-sighted and could stifle innovation.

""Locking domestic plants into outdated technology is not a recipe for future competitiveness or bringing manufacturing jobs back to American communities,"" Nadel said.

The Center for Climate and Energy Solutions estimated that the cuts to the projects, meant to be test cases for huge industrial programs, could result in the loss of 25,000 jobs and $4.6 billion in economic output.

The review of the projects came after the Energy Department sought to identify waste, protect America’s national security and advance President Trump’s goal to unleash affordable, reliable and secure energy for the American people, the agency said.

These funds will help address the environmental impacts of historically contaminated properties, paving the way for community revitalization and economic development. The city has been notified of the awards and is now working to submit all required documentation. It is anticipated that the project period for both grants will be Oct. 1, 2025, through Sept. 30, 2029, although the entire time frame may not be required for project completion.

Cleanup Grant: Remediation of the Former Knox Laundry Site

The $713,600 Cleanup Grant will support environmental remediation efforts at the former Knox Laundry site, located at the property previously known as 57 N. Kellogg St./332 E. Ferris St. Operated as a retail laundry since 1898 and later expanded into a multi-story dry-cleaning facility, the property was vacated and condemned due to its deteriorated condition and ultimately demolished by court order in 2006–2007. Terminating the business operations and removing former structures has stopped the potential for any continuing releases of contamination into our environment, but until the site is fully remediated, the potential for redevelopment is very limited.

The city plans to use grant funds to address remaining contamination, specifically targeting soils impacted above saturation limits. The project will include treatment of affected areas and installation of an engineered barrier, such as pavement, to safely limit potential exposure and prepare the site for future redevelopment.

So the US is almost 50 percent more expensive to build a solar facility than the cost of building it in Europe.
And the biggest reason that it’s more expensive here is because of all the tariffs that we have on solar.","This story originally appeared on Inside Climate News and is part of the Climate Desk collaboration.

The Trump administration’s ever-changing policies on tariffs and trade have injected chaos into the global energy economy.

On Wednesday, a federal court blocked President Donald Trump from being able to adopt tariffs under an emergency-powers law. The administration is appealing the ruling. This sets up additional legal wrangling in addition to the conflicts over trade that were already happening.

Analysts at the research firm Wood Mackenzie gave themselves the task of predicting where US tariff policy may be heading. The result is a report issued this week, “Trading Cases: Tariff Scenarios for Taxing Times,” that shows the huge gap in outcomes between a trade war and a trade truce.

My main takeaway from it is that everyone loses in a prolonged conflict. Even the oil and gas industry, which has close ties to the Trump administration, would face falling prices for its products at the same time that the costs of much of its equipment are rising because of tariffs.

The US renewable energy and battery industries stand out for the potential severity of their downturns because development here relies heavily on components made in other countries. The Biden administration sought to encourage manufacturers to build in the United States, but those efforts are still in their early stages, and many of the government incentives are now on the chopping block.

Under a “trade truce” scenario, in which tariffs return to 2024 levels, the global economy would grow by an average of 2.7 percent between now and 2030, the report says. The “trade tensions” scenario would mean that tariff barriers increase compared to last year, but the economy would still grow, albeit at a lower rate. The most damaging is the “trade war” scenario, with the United States maintaining an effective tariff rate of 30 percent or more, leading to a global recession.

The report says the middle forecast, “trade tensions,” is the most likely to occur.

Why is this conflict happening? The short version is that Trump and his advisers believe that tariffs will help the US economy by encouraging construction of factories here, reducing trade deficits and punishing barriers to entry of US products in other countries.

“We will supercharge our domestic industrial base,” Trump said in an April 2 speech announcing tariffs on nearly every US trading partner. “We will pry open foreign markets and break down foreign trade barriers and ultimately, more production at home will mean stronger competition and lower prices for consumers.”

A tariff is a tax charged by a government on imports. As the US government has increased its tariffs, other countries have retaliated with their own increases.

Adding to the chaos is that the policies frequently change, with the president often announcing shifts on social media, as happened in recent days on tariffs on the European Union.

I spoke with Chris Seiple, Wood Mackenzie’s vice chairman for power and renewables, to drill down on the parts of the report that deal with renewables. Here is that conversation, edited for length and clarity:

Dan Gearino: For renewable energy industries, is the big problem that tariffs make everything more expensive, or is there more to it than that?

Chris Seiple: Sure, things getting more expensive is a big part of it. I think the second challenge, and this is kind of unique to the power business, is that there’s a heavy hand of regulation. And so there’s a lot of US utilities that have to go through pretty extensive regulatory processes to get approval for what they want to build. Being in a world where there’s so much tariff uncertainty, they don’t know what it’s going to cost to build what they want to build. It’s particularly challenging for this industry to be able to navigate that, and it impacts renewables more than it impacts, say, other sectors like gas or coal, because we rely upon imports of equipment to such a bigger degree, especially for battery storage, where we’re essentially entirely dependent at this point on imports from China.

With battery storage, there has been an attempt to increase manufacturing capacity in the US. How would you characterize where that stands?

Very early days. A lot of battery manufacturing that’s going on within the US is meant to supply batteries to EV vehicles, not stationary utility-scale storage projects. And so the amount of manufacturing capacity in comparison to what the demand is for that equipment results in us importing well more than 90 percent of what we need.

I also think the tariff on it is just as important as the uncertainty about not knowing where the end game is and what the tariffs are going to be. So, if you’re on the manufacturing side of the renewables business, you’re making investment decisions that have very long lives when you’re building a manufacturing facility. Having that uncertainty around the investment climate and what the level of tariffs is going to be over the long-term just makes it more challenging to make all of those decisions.

During the early part of this year, as this tariff war was starting, I had, like, biweekly calls from this manufacturer in Korea, just exasperated, saying, “Doesn’t the US government know that we’re making long lead time decisions, and we need to have some sort of clarity around what the policy environment is going to be, not just for the next four years, but for the next 10 years?” The US is making it very challenging right now to make these types of investment decisions.

Is there any US energy industry that benefits from trade tensions?

I don’t think anybody benefits, per se, from the trade tensions. Everybody, no matter what part of the energy sector you’re in, is having to navigate the uncertainty around what the tariff levels are going to be. That said, the overall policy environment has changed to one that is more favorable for natural gas. The fact that we are an exporter of natural gas and have all of the domestic resources that we need makes it less impacted by tariffs than what other sectors are, like renewables. But even for E&P [exploration and production of oil and gas], they utilize steel in that process. There are tariffs on steel. Steel prices have gone up. It has a negative impact on all energy sectors.

One part of this report that jumped out to me is you said that the US may be stuck with older technologies, especially when it comes to solar, while the rest of the world advances at a quicker pace. What’s the long-term effect of that?

Before I answer that question directly, let me just give you some context.

We estimate that the cost of building a utility-scale solar project is about $1.15 a watt in the US. The comparable number in China is about 42 cents a watt. It’s not surprising that the cost of building a solar facility in China is a lot less than the cost of building a solar facility in the US.

What is very surprising when we put this data together is how much less expensive it is to build a solar project in Europe than it is in the US. It’s about 70 cents a watt to build a solar facility in Europe compared to the US. So the US is almost 50 percent more expensive to build a solar facility than the cost of building it in Europe. And the biggest reason that it’s more expensive here is because of all the tariffs that we have on solar. It’s not the only reason, but it’s the biggest reason. So we’ve already kind of penalized solar with the tariffs that we have in place.

And then, on the technology evolution issue, it’s the Chinese manufacturers that have the most sophisticated capability in solar manufacturing, and who are putting a lot more R&D into it than any US company is doing. And so, we essentially have policies in place that prohibit and make it uneconomic for US companies to be able to purchase Chinese technology, then that is what leaves us in a position where we’re not using the most advanced technology that’s available to the rest of the world. The long-term implication of that is it deprives the US of a low-cost source of energy that’s available everywhere else, and creates kind of an unlevel playing field in our efforts to have to power our industries with the lowest-cost energy solutions that are available.

These tariff policies seem to change almost daily. Is there an expectation that eventually things will settle down?

I think that’s the central challenge for the industry, that they don’t know where the ultimate outcome is going to fall. Nobody can really fully answer that question, and what makes it particularly challenging is that there’ve been so many different rationales given as to why we’re pursuing one tariff or another that it makes it hard to divine what the ultimate endgame is going to be. Is it about reducing a trade balance? Is it about supporting domestic manufacturing? Are there other policy goals that are trying to be achieved as a result of the tariffs? Not knowing that is what makes it very difficult for people to operate day to day.","https://media.wired.com/photos/683994a4f001b3464f287c18/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-2197485258.jpg",N,,2025-05-31 10:00:55.137706

Lula has often stood by her in that fight, but does he still have the stomach and the inclination to continue?","Political bullying is rarely as brutal as it was in Brazil this week when the environment minister Marina Silva was ambushed in a senate meeting. Her thuggish tormentors – all white male politicians on the infrastructure committee – took turns to publicly belittle the 67-year-old black woman, who has done more than anyone to protect the natural wealth of the country – the Amazon rainforest, Pantanal wetlands, Cerrado savannah and other biomes – from rapacious abuse.

One by one, they lined up to attack her for these globally important efforts. Decorum gave way to name-calling and sneering: “Know your place,” roared the committee head, Marcos Rogério, a Bolsonarist who cut Silva’s microphone as she tried to respond. The leader of the centre-rightPSDB, Plínio Valério, told her she did not deserve respect as a minister. The Amazonas senator Omar Aziz – from the Centrão party and a supporter of president Lula – talked over her repeatedly.

Their motives appeared to be partly ideological, partly misogynistic and largely self-interested. All of them were trying to force through economic projects – roads, oilfields, dams or plantations – that are under scrutiny by Silva’s environment ministry. Never mind that this is her job, they seemed to say, how dare she not allow them to have their way?

But she did dare. Despite her frail physique, Silva is a fighter. Born in the Amazon rainforest, she helped to found the Workers’ party alongside Lula during the era of military dictatorship. She campaigned against deforestation alongside Chico Mendes, who was assassinated in 1988. In her first stint as environment minister, between 2003 and 2008, she established a monitoring-and-penalty system that she said reduced forest clearance by 80%. Later, she ran as president for the Green party, securing nearly 20m votes – more than any other Green candidate in world history. Twelve years ago, she founded her own party – the Sustainability Network.

Silva refused to tolerate being abused and silenced, and walked out of the senate meeting. Outside, when she finally had a chance to speak, she turned on her tormentors: “My place is the place to defend democracy, my place is the place to defend the environment, to combat inequality, sustainable development, to protect biodiversity, and infrastructure projects that are necessary for the country,” she said defiantly. “What is unacceptable is for someone to think that because you are a woman, black, and come from a humble background, that you are going to say who I am and still say that I should stay in my place. My place is where all women should be.”

This version of what happened has been reported widely in the Brazilian media, but it tells only part of the story. What is missing – and more important – is why the pack of senators felt Silva was vulnerable. That is because over the previous few days, Lula had taken the side of the oil industry rather than the Amazon rainforest, and then – not by coincidence – the Brazilian environmental movement suffered one of the biggest legislative defeats in its history.

At the centre of everything is a long-running row over oil exploration in the Foz do Amazonas. BP and the French oil company Total used to hold most of these rights, but they baulked at the political and environmental challenge of drilling so close to the world’s biggest centre of terrestrial biodiversity. Instead, Brazil’s state-run oil company, Petrobras, stepped up. For Lula – and the senators in nearby regions – that meant potential votes, jobs and export earnings. The only thing standing in their way was the environment ministry, which has delayed a licence for years due to the risks of a possible spill in such an ecologically sensitive area.

That handbrake was lifted earlier this week, when the head of the environmental regulator, Ibama, ignored the warnings of 29 expert advisers by moving on to the next stage of the approval process for operations in the Foz do Amazonas. This capitulation followed pressure from Congress and the president.

This was followed by the biggest legislative setback for the environment in more than 40 years. To the delight of the mining, construction and farming industries, the senate has passed a long-pending bill that strips a range of environmental licensing powers from Silva’s ministry. This piece of legislation – dubbed the devastation bill by opponents – allows companies to self-license or avoid environmental licensing for road construction, dam-building and other projects. It is a shift of control from the representatives of the people to the executives of big companies.

Lula could yet wield a veto on this bill. But so far the president’s response has been tepid. His party has a weak presence in congress, so he depends on a broad and fractious coalition, many of whose members are enmeshed in agribusiness or mining. Next year’s presidential election seems to be weighing on his mind more than November’s Cop30 climate summit in Belém.

In the wake of the attacks on Silva by the senate infrastructure committee, Lula publicly came to her defence. He said she was right to walk out in the face of so much provocation. But he has not faced up to his responsibility for leaving her exposed. Nor has he faced up to the contradictions of his own promise to achieve zero deforestation by 2030 and his support for evidently incompatible projects, such as oil drilling off the coast of the Amazon, an upgraded BR319 road that would open up the forest between Manaus and Porto Velho to greater clearance activities, and a new grain railway that would increase pressure for more soya bean plantations.

At the Amazon Summit in Belém two years ago, he declined to sign up to Colombian president Gustavo Petro’s calls for a fossil-free rainforest. Soon after, at Cop28 in Dubai, his government shocked many of its supporters by announcing it would join the Opec+ oil cartel. Lula can argue that this is pragmatism as Brazil depends on petroleum sales for a growing share of its GDP. Fossil fuel realpolitik is likely to be evident at a Brics summit in Rio de Janeiro in July, where the Brazilian president will rub shoulders with China’s Xi Jinping of China, Russia’s Vladimir Putin, India’s Narendra Modi and other world leaders.

Lula has thrown Marina Silva under a cement mixer once before – in 2008, when she was forced to leave his second-term government because too many ministers saw her as a drag on economic development. He may feel reluctant to do so again before Cop30, because he knows she is vital for Brazil’s environmental credibility in the eyes of much of the world, and he does not want his country to return to the pariah status it endured during the Bolsonaro years. But the sands are shifting and Lula seems unsure of his footing.

His base – the working class and poor – are already suffering the brunt of climate impacts. The south of Brazil has been deluged by devastating floods. The northern Amazon has been stricken by record droughts and fires.

Civil society and progressive thinkers – almost all of whom usually support Lula – have been far more active than the president in opposing the devastation bill and defending the environment minister on social media, where many public figures have posted “Marina is not alone” messages of support.

But like many other centre left leaders in the world, Lula is struggling in the age of Trump, of rightwing extremism, of warmongering, of geopolitical realignment and corporate backtracking on the environment. As Silva showed, it takes courage to face those forces. Lula has often stood by her in that fight, but does he still have the stomach and the inclination to continue?",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e983851f45c534eec8b7c4343b5e312e78f355c/437_0_4372_3498/master/4372.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=db4cfcf71840ae9b27e57993d90cf63f,N,,2025-05-31 10:01:12.075406

He’s hoping to see lawmakers engage in “more thoughtful discussion” on the bill’s clean energy provisions, especially the 60-day construction requirement for commercial solar projects.
One of the best ways to do that is deploying solar [energy].”","As lawmakers in the U.S. Senate face a July 4 deadline to pass a budget reconciliation package narrowly approved by the House of Representatives, renewable energy industry groups and businesses in Central Florida are bracing for painful “disruptions” they say would come from the bill’s proposed repeal of clean energy incentives. Many of those clean energy incentives enacted under the Biden administration funneled jobs and billions of dollars into Republican-controlled states, including Florida.

One provision in the bill’s current language would disqualify projects from using an existing commercial solar energy tax credit, unless project construction begins within 60 days of the bill’s enactment.

Such an abrupt shift would breed an unpredictable, “horribly harmful” environment for companies and people working on commercial solar projects, according to Ben Pauluhn, founder and president of Optimus Energy Solutions. The Mount Dora-based company specializes in electric vehicle infrastructure and commercial and residential solar energy projects.

“The employment disruption on that 60-day provision will be massive, and it will not be painless, and it will be nationwide,” Pauluhn said. “It would really put a dampener on a whole lot of momentum that America is currently on with energy independence.”

An earlier version of the bill that would’ve gradually phased out the commercial tax credit over a period of six years made much more financial and logistical sense, Pauluhn said. But as it currently stands, the bill would derail his growing company, throwing it into “survival mode, essentially overnight.”

“Any business can plan for a six-year phase-out,” Pauluhn said. “It's an off-ramp. Agree or disagree with it; from a policy and a business standpoint, one can plan for that.

“If it is halted overnight, the employment disruptions … will be so disruptive that it will cause meaningful pain to people, communities and businesses that is probably not necessary,” Pauluhn said.

In Florida, more than 100,000 jobs are at stake if the proposed repeal of federal tax credits goes through, according to one third-party analysis commissioned by ConservAmerica, a conservative-leaning nonprofit. That report also estimates the average Florida household would pay about $83 more annually for energy costs.

There are more than 52,000 electric vehicles in Orange County alone, many of which were purchased using consumer credits that would be discontinued under the bill, according to Dory Larsen, Senior Electric Transportation Program Manager for the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy.

“When we look at repealing these programs, it represents broken promises to American consumers,” Larsen said. “And the result would be higher energy costs that we would all be forced to pay.”

Regardless of the barriers, solar energy is here to stay, Pauluhn said — but the question is, at what cost? He’s hoping to see lawmakers engage in “more thoughtful discussion” on the bill’s clean energy provisions, especially the 60-day construction requirement for commercial solar projects.

“Building, maintaining the infrastructure to deliver electricity is going to continue to be more expensive, irrespective of where the electricity comes from,” Pauluhn said. “So we darn well better keep the cost of electricity down. One of the best ways to do that is deploying solar [energy].”",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0308e99/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1050+0+139/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F3b%2Fb3%2F00ae5ccf4118a69af5211b81a9c7%2Flightbulb-energy-via-pexels-daniel-reche.jpg,N,,2025-05-31 12:19:14.301108

In Pennsylvania, residents living in the shadow of U.S. Steel’s plants have contended with air pollution caused by their operations for generations.
The United Steelworkers union endorsed Kamala Harris for president and has long opposed the sale of U.S. Steel to Nippon.
“Nippon Steel could bring U.S. Steel workers certainty and hope for the future,” he said.
“If Nippon Steel extends this thinking to U.S. Steel, it could entrench coal for another generation.”","President Donald Trump returned to western Pennsylvania Friday to announce an ending to the months-long saga to decide who would own the Pittsburgh-based steelmaking company U.S. Steel.

But even as the deal moves toward a resolution, questions about what it will mean for public health, local economies and climate change linger. U.S. Steel’s coal-based steelmaking facilities are a major source of air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions in Pennsylvania.

Nippon Steel of Japan agreed to buy the iconic American company for $15 billion in 2023. In 2024, the sale was opposed by former President Joe Biden and by Trump. Trump said that he was “totally against” the sale and vowed to “block this deal from happening” as president.

Now, Trump has changed his mind.

Speaking at U.S. Steel’s Irvin Works in West Mifflin, Trump said he was there to celebrate a “blockbuster agreement” with Nippon. He added that he will double tariffs on steel imports from 25 percent to 50 percent. The increase would “further secure the steel industry in the United States,” he said. “Nobody is going to get around that.”

“We saved the company,” Trump added. His speech was short on details about the structure of the deal or Nippon’s investments in U.S. Steel’s facilities, and much remains unknown.

On May 23, Trump announced on Truth Social that he had approved the sale, calling it a “planned partnership” between U.S. Steel and Nippon that would add “$14 billion to the U.S. economy.” The deal had been held up by a national security review carried out by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S.

U.S. Steel praised Trump and said the company will “remain American” and “will grow bigger and stronger through a partnership with Nippon Steel that brings massive investment, new technologies and thousands of jobs over the next four years.”

In an interview with CNBC, U.S. Sen. Dave McCormick (R-Pa.) said the U.S. government would have a “golden share” that “will essentially require U.S. government approval of a number of the board members” and that $2.4 billion would be invested in the Mon Valley Works, U.S. Steel’s four facilities in western Pennsylvania.

Trump’s reversal comes at the same time that his administration is pushing for more coal power, and after he signed an executive order called “Reinvigorating America’s Beautiful Clean Coal Industry.” The Department of Energy recently designated coal used in steelmaking as a “critical material.” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said coal is “a cornerstone of our industrial base” and a “key input for steel production.”

But that’s at odds with the current reality of American steel manufacturing. Less than a third of steel in the U.S. is still made using coal. The majority of American steel is made in electric arc furnaces using recycled scrap steel and natural gas.

On Friday, Trump said U.S. Steel will “maintain all of its current operating blast furnaces at full capacity for a minimum of the next 10 years.”

“We have that as a commitment,” he said.

Older blast furnaces, like those at the U.S. Steel-owned Edgar Thomson steel mill in western Pennsylvania, are powered by coke, a concentrated and highly polluting form of coal. The Mon Valley Works plants, the oldest of which opened in 1875, include the Clairton Coke Works, which makes coke from coal.

“Most of the new mills, including U.S. Steel’s new mill in Arkansas, they’re not dependent upon coal, and that’s the worldwide trend,” said Matt Mehalik, the executive director at the Pennsylvania-based environmental nonprofit Breathe Project. “So a coal-based manufacturing policy is really a backwards-looking one. It’s sort of like saying, in 1903, ‘Steam engines are important, too. Why would we switch to a gasoline engine?’”

If Nippon spends money to keep U.S. Steel’s aging facilities in Pennsylvania and Indiana dependent on coal for another generation, that decision could have long-term negative consequences for workers and residents.

Coal-based steelmaking is linked to serious health problems like cancer for people living nearby. In Pennsylvania, residents living in the shadow of U.S. Steel’s plants have contended with air pollution caused by their operations for generations. The company also has a long history of permit violations and financial penalties. In 2024, U.S. Steel agreed to a $42 million settlement related to faulty pollution control systems at the Clairton Coke Works.

U.S. Steel did not respond to a request for comment for this story but has maintained that it is committed to “safe and environmentally responsible steelmaking.”

The deal also has significant climate implications, said Mike Williams, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress who works on climate policy and labor issues. Steel manufacturing is a substantial contributor to the climate crisis globally. “It’s really, really, really important that we get this right,” he said, of the need to decarbonize the industry.

Neither company has a good track record on climate, he said. And the involvement of the Trump administration in U.S. Steel’s decision-making could “portend very poorly” when it comes to modernizing the American steel industry.

“This administration has such an animus towards anything that fights climate change,” he said. “That’s terrible for the future competitiveness of our industries.”

If Nippon commits to coal, Williams said, it may save some jobs in the short term. But “there’s a strong chance they’re going to be just outstripped in terms of competitiveness” in the global market. Doubling down on coal in steelmaking “doesn’t particularly make sense” economically or environmentally, he said.

A website Nippon created to highlight the benefits of the U.S. Steel deal says the sale will drive the “global steel industry toward carbon neutrality and our shared commitment of decarbonization by 2050.”

The Mon Valley is familiar with promises to invest in its declining steelmaking infrastructure. Those promises have rarely panned out.

“This timeline goes all the way back to the 1970s,” Mehalik said, of a Breathe Project initiative to chronicle each of U.S. Steel’s pledges that failed to materialize. “It’s almost like every five years they promise to do something, and then they don’t.” In 2019, U.S. Steel said it would spend more than $1 billion to upgrade the Mon Valley Works. Two years later, the project was canceled.

U.S. Steel’s workers have similar fears about Nippon’s and the administration’s promises of more investment and jobs. The United Steelworkers union endorsed Kamala Harris for president and has long opposed the sale of U.S. Steel to Nippon.

In his speech on Friday, Trump said “there will be no layoffs and no outsourcing” and said workers would each receive a $5,000 bonus. The deal “includes vital protections to ensure that all steelworkers will keep their jobs at all facilities in the United States,” he said.

The union continued to express opposition to the deal this week. “Our concern remains that Nippon, a foreign corporation with a long and proven track record of violating our trade laws, will further erode domestic steelmaking capacity and jeopardize thousands of good, union jobs,” said David McCall, the president of USW, in a statement on Tuesday.

U.S. Steel’s workforce has shrunk from hundreds of thousands of workers in its 20th-century heyday to around 22,000 today.

Roger Smith, Asia lead at SteelWatch, a nonprofit focused on the decarbonization of the steel industry, said that Nippon could choose to invest in cutting-edge green steelmaking technology to dramatically lower pollution and cut emissions. “Nippon Steel could bring U.S. Steel workers certainty and hope for the future,” he said.

Smith said the global trend away from coal-based steelmaking will ultimately override the Trump administration’s “protectionist agenda for coal and its anti-renewable energy actions.”

“The question is really not whether the steel industry will decarbonize but how quickly,” he said.

But the Trump administration and Nippon could slow down that transition in the U.S. at a critical time. Nippon “has a paper commitment to achieve net zero emissions, but remains committed to existing coal-based blast furnaces in Japan, building new ones through its joint venture in India and continues to acquire shares in coal mines,” Smith said. “If Nippon Steel extends this thinking to U.S. Steel, it could entrench coal for another generation.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/GettyImages-2217152392-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-05-31 13:10:02.974394

Wyoming State Sen. Larry Hicks proposed a temporary ban on renewable energy projects.
In one recent week, nearly half of Texas’s electricity came from solar and wind power.
There does exist public support for clean energy in Wyoming, which is why Hicks’ initiative failed.
The Sierra Madre Wind Energy Project, now under construction near Rawlins, will be the nation’s largest wind farm.","Wyoming is the second windiest state, after Nebraska. It’s obvious why the wind power industry is investing $10 billion there. And it’s hard to see why any state politician would oppose this. But some have. Wyoming is one of those fossil-fuel producing states in which so-called conservatives feel obligated — or are paid — to stop competition from clean energy. Texas is another.

Wyoming State Sen. Larry Hicks proposed a temporary ban on renewable energy projects. “It does one thing: puts a moratorium on wind and solar for the next five years,” he said. “It’s a simple little bill.”

A “simple,” five-year plan? How do you say, “Aw, shucks” in Russian?

Hicks swiftly diverted blame to California: “Our friends on the ‘left coast’ with their renewable portfolio demands, eliminating fossil fuels and moving in a direction that’s unsustainable.”

We can’t untie this knot of confused ideology. But let’s point out that renewable energy is the only kind of energy that is, by definition, sustainable. Wyoming may have coal, oil and gas. But it has wind forever.

This hostility toward wind power is even weirder in Texas. Texas harvests more electricity from wind than any other state, or nearly 28% of all wind-generated electricity in the U.S. In one recent week, nearly half of Texas’s electricity came from solar and wind power.

The key for these renewables is batteries that can store power when the wind doesn’t blow or the sun doesn’t shine. Texas has been crowned “ground zero” for a U.S. battery boom. Last year it switched on more power stored in batteries than California did.

Texas was expected to double its storage capacity this year — that is, until Donald Trump slapped huge tariffs on China. More than two-thirds of imported batteries come from China.

In March, the Texas Senate passed a mandate that half of all new power capacity come from sources other than battery storage. In other words, at least 50% of all new power plant capacity had to be produced from coal, natural gas and oil. (The natural gas industry needed propping.)

Back in Wyoming, lawmakers wedded to fossil fuels are complaining that large wind and solar projects are fundamentally changing the look of Wyoming’s wide-open spaces. That’s ignoring the aesthetics of Wyoming’s coal pits, wide open craters that stretch for miles.

Wyoming is more than 63 times the size of Rhode Island, with less than half the population of the Ocean State. There are dozens of wind turbines in Rhode Island, onshore and off. More are planned with minimal complaint. Wyoming could easily accommodate new wind projects under its big sky.

There does exist public support for clean energy in Wyoming, which is why Hicks’ initiative failed. Gov. Mark Gordon tried to bridge the differences by endorsing an “all of the above energy strategy.” He wants to keep Wyoming as “the energy state” but also to address climate change by developing clean renewables.

The far-right Freedom Caucus went after Gordon for acknowledging climate change. It introduced a bill designed to stop the state from pursuing any carbon reduction targets and titled it “Make Carbon Dioxide Great Again.”

A pragmatic Republican, Gordon called such proposals as “a little bit stupid.”

The bottom line is that Wyoming continues to develop wind energy projects. The Sierra Madre Wind Energy Project, now under construction near Rawlins, will be the nation’s largest wind farm.

Much of what happens from here on in depends on Washington. The recently passed House bill strips away subsidies for renewables. How it fares in the Senate remains to be seen. Suffice it to say, slowing America’s move to cleaner and also cheaper energy is more than a little bit stupid.

Trump-appointed Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin’s efforts — likely to be officially introduced early next month to then be open for public comment — go against relevant expert scientific advice, public health considerations and basic logic. Nonetheless, they are key components of the Trump Administration’s — and Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025 — larger ideologically and profit-driven push to dismantle decades of established U.S. and international science and policy progress to address the harms associated with GHG pollution.

Let’s briefly revisit the clear understanding of the interactions between GHGs, climate change and public health: carbon dioxide, methane and other GHGs from fossil fuel-burning power plants drive human-caused climate change and threaten public health. These connections were firmly established through research in the 1970s, ‘80s and ‘90s that fed into clear statements in United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Assessments beginning in the 1990s (and every UN IPCC report since then).

Moreover, the power sector is responsible for 25-30% of GHGs in this country, with transportation as the leading source of GHG pollution in the U.S. These facts prompted U.S. policy action beginning over 50 years ago. Most prominent is the 1970 Clean Air Act, which was focused on local and regional air pollution as well as GHG emissions as they relate to environmental harms and public health threats.

About thirty years later — in the face of special interest efforts to not fulfill and to weaken CAA standards — twelve states (not including Colorado), along with several organizations (like the Environmental Defense Fund), petitioned the EPA to regulate GHGs from vehicles (transportation) and stationary sources (power plants). They argued that the EPA had failed to implement the terms and requirements laid out in the CAA. This culminated in a 2007 Supreme Court ruling that the EPA did have authority and responsibility to regulate GHG emissions under the 1970 CAA because GHGs were determined to be air pollutants that endangered public health and welfare.

While the 1970 CAA outlined requirements of the EPA to set emissions limits and standards on air pollution — including GHGs — the EPA under George W. Bush skirted these responsibilities, reasoning that there remained enough uncertainty about linkages between GHG emissions and climate change. This obstinance was formally supported by groups such as the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers and the Utility Air Regulatory Group, as this would potentially increase their costs of doing business. The 2007 decision was a 5-4 ruling by the Supreme Court, and notably one of the dissenting justices was Chief Justice John Roberts. Yet, from this ruling, the EPA finalized an “endangerment finding” in 2009 that has set the stage for regulations on coal and gas-fired power plants since then.

Legislative decisions like these have been credited with the avoidance of thousands of premature deaths, lost school and work days annually, as well as declines in respiratory illnesses and other ailments that have saved health care costs and improved human quality of life in the U.S.

In Trump’s first term, he sought various rollbacks and stalled the EPA’s Clean Power Plan from the Obama Administration. But Biden reinstated these rules and further strengthened them through the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.

In Trump’s second term, these EPA moves have come when there are concurrent threats to remove the U.S. from the 1992 UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and to strip California’s authority to set vehicle emissions standards and Electric Vehicle rules. And the Supreme Court of 2025 is more amenable to upholding these actions.

We are also mired in a time of rampant mis- and disinformation problems. The leaked plan argues that fossil fuel burning “does not contribute significantly to dangerous pollution,” clearly at odds with convergent agreement in relevant expert research communities going back many decades. Nonetheless, in March, Zeldin also laid out EPA and Trump Administration plans to challenge the 2009 “endangerment finding” among many related efforts to repeal and repel policy efforts to protect public health in the U.S.

That’s superior to the median for model-year 2024 EVs, which was reported at 283 miles by the U.S. Energy Department.

The abundant sunrays can provide juice for your EV, and they are applicable for tax breaks, as well.
“The performance breakthrough of sodium-ion batteries is a key development in the full scenario application of batteries,” the CATL statement said.","BEIJING – China-based Contemporary Amperex Technologies, or CATL, is mass-producing sodium-ion batteries, bringing to fruition a technology that has the potential to replace common lithium-ion chemistry, according to a news release from the company.

“With sodium’s inherent safety and abundant reserves, it efficiently reduces dependence on lithium resources and strengthens the foundation of new energy technologies, while promoting energy utilization from ‘single resource dependence’ to ‘energy freedom,'” CATL said in the statement reported by Yahoo News.

Experts worldwide are studying sodium-based batteries for those reasons and others. A lower energy density — or the amount of power the pack can store per pound — compared to lithium has been a holdup, CleanTechnica reported.

CATL’s Naxtra Battery, made for passenger EVs with a version for heavy-duty start-stop use, seems to solve the problem. The passenger pack can provide over 310 miles of range. That’s superior to the median for model-year 2024 EVs, which was reported at 283 miles by the U.S. Energy Department. Those rides are mostly all powered by lithium-ion cells.

The packs can also safely operate between minus 40 degrees and 178 degrees Fahrenheit while maintaining 90% of “usable power” at the coldest mark. It can function for more than 10,000 cycles, all per CATL. New Atlas added that it equates to 3.6 million miles driving before significant capacity loss.

On the heavy-duty side, Naxtra’s 24-volt product is meant to replace lead-acid packs in dirty combustion vehicles, with an eight-year life cycle. There’s also a 61% reduction in costs during that time compared to traditional types.

It’s built to handle frequent restarts for rigs with engines that stop when idling. It’s a fuel-saving trick that’s been in use for more than a decade. The tech made headlines in the April 2011 issue of Car and Driver, for reference. The Naxtra battery is said to be able to fire a start after being idle for a year, all per CATL.

“Compared to lead-acid batteries, it is more efficient, eco-friendly, and economical, driving commercial vehicles into a lead-free era where vehicle and battery age as one,” per the statement.

While that is impressive, fully electric and cleaner haulers are already on the road, including from Tesla. A 24-hour EV rig from Danfoss is being developed in Denmark, among other projects.

Naxtra’s passenger version ideally parks gas burners, preventing planet-warming tailpipe exhaust linked by medical experts to lung, heart, and other health risks, including dementia. Diesel exhaust is “thought to be a likely human carcinogen,” according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

Sodium chemistry is coming in all sizes, with a huge stationary storage unit recently going online in China. It can store enough renewable energy to power 12,000 homes a day.

Other breakthroughs in various stages of development include lithium iron phosphate and even cannabis cars. As you might guess, the chemistry for the latter pack is unique.

The experts are trying to reduce the tens of millions of tons of deposits that Sustainability by Numbers reported will need to be mined and processed to power clean energy goals by 2040. While that is a lot, it’s nowhere near the 16.5 billion tons of fossil fuels mined annually, per the findings.

Sodium’s abundance and easier extraction could limit the impact of battery-making even more.

However, lithium-ion batteries remain reliable and safe, with rides owned by more people than ever. And now is a great time to buy one stateside, as tax credits to offset the cost are still available. That’s in addition to the loads of cash you can bank annually by eliminating gas and/or maintenance expenses.

Adding a home solar panel system can increase your savings. The abundant sunrays can provide juice for your EV, and they are applicable for tax breaks, as well. EnergySage offers free online support to help you navigate the process and even find an installer.

For CATL’s part, company experts envision a salty future for EVs.

The proposed cuts, embedded in the One Big Beautiful Bill, threaten to unravel a project that once symbolized American manufacturing's green-energy pivot. For investors, this is no longer a theoretical debate—it's a critical test of how policy instability is reshaping capital allocation in the EV supply chain. The stakes are high: Ford's Michigan plant, now 60% complete, embodies the risks of tying multibillion-dollar investments to shifting regulatory winds.

The Threat to Ford's Michigan Project: Policy Uncertainty Meets Geopolitical Tensions

The Senate's consideration of the One Big Beautiful Bill—which would end EV tax credits by 2026—directly imperils Ford's Marshall plant. Originally valued at $3.5 billion and poised to create 2,500 jobs, the project has already been scaled back to $2 billion and 1,700 jobs due to reduced state incentives and market headwinds. Now, the plant's viability hinges on whether lawmakers exempt it from the tax credit cuts. .

The plant's reliance on technology from China's CATL—a firm now classified as a “foreign entity of concern” (FEOC) under the bill—adds another layer of risk. Ford's partnership with CATL, which provides advanced battery chemistry, has become a geopolitical flashpoint. If the Senate retains FEOC restrictions, the plant could lose eligibility for federal subsidies altogether, despite its strategic role in domestic EV production. Ford's warning that “retroactive policy changes undermine investment confidence” underscores the broader problem: policy instability is deterring capital from long-term EV projects.

Policy Chaos: A Recipe for Supply Chain Fragmentation

The Senate's dithering over tax credits reflects a deeper issue: U.S. energy policy lacks the coherence needed to sustain EV manufacturing competitiveness. The One Big Beautiful Bill's abrupt cuts contrast sharply with the Inflation Reduction Act's (IRA) original vision of a decade-long transition to clean energy. This whiplash creates a high-risk environment for companies like Ford, which must now weigh the costs of U.S. manufacturing—already $2,000 per vehicle due to tariffs—against the possibility of losing subsidies.

The ripple effects extend beyond Ford. Automakers such as Hyundai and General Motors, which similarly depend on federal incentives to meet EV mandates, face production cuts if credits expire. Meanwhile, Tesla, with its brand loyalty and carbon-credit revenue streams, may weather the storm. .

Investment Imperatives: Prioritize Stability, Avoid Regulatory Whiplash

Investors must act decisively to mitigate exposure to policy reversals. Here's the playbook:

Favor Firms with Diversified Supply Chains: Companies like Tesla, which source critical minerals domestically or via stable partnerships, are better insulated from FEOC restrictions.

Advocate for Policy Certainty: Engage with firms pushing for stable incentives—such as those lobbying for IRA extensions or FEOC carve-outs.

Short-Term Plays on Senate Dynamics: Monitor the Senate's July deadline to finalize the bill. If amendments soften tax credit cuts or carve out exemptions for U.S. projects, EV equities could rebound.

Conclusion: Act Before the Senate Acts

The Senate's July vote on the One Big Beautiful Bill is a pivotal moment. Investors who wait risk missing the window to position portfolios for a post-tax-credit landscape. Prioritize firms like Tesla (TSLA) or those with geographically diversified supply chains, while avoiding automakers overly dependent on fading incentives. The Michigan plant's fate is a stark reminder: in the EV race, policy stability is as vital as battery chemistry.

Encouragingly, a growing number of Republican members of Congress are vocalizing their support for the clean energy tax credits.","On May 22, the House of Representatives voted to pass a budget bill that drastically cuts America’s clean energy tax credits. I’m disappointed to see that the House advanced this legislation.

Make no mistake: These cuts will hurt Pennsylvania if they go on to become law. Experts are already warning that these changes would raise energy costs for American households, increase pollution, and threaten growing economic investments in the commonwealth. The House passage of this bill just put these investments at risk.

Federal tax credits — designed to boost clean energy manufacturing in the U.S. — have been working. Since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in 2022, Pennsylvania has benefited from just under $3.5 billion in investments in 34 clean energy projects to create more than 7,900 jobs. That’s according to an analysis by Citizens’ Climate Lobby.

An outsized chunk of that investment is in the state’s 15th Congressional District, represented in Congress by Glenn Thompson. Nine projects — eight solar and one for electric transmission lines — have spurred $1.7 billion in investments in PA15 with an estimated 2,550 jobs to be created.

The tax credits were passed by Democrats, so they have been an easy target for Republican attacks. But the legislation has overwhelmingly benefited Republican-held districts — 78% of the funding has gone to rural and suburban areas held by the GOP.

That success story, however, could unravel quickly. The legislation is now in the Senate’s hands, and the House passage has set them on a path toward drastic cuts.

If the cuts become law, energy prices will rise. Manufacturing will slow. Phasing out tax credits that support clean energy manufacturing will jeopardize long-term projects. Eliminating clean vehicle tax credits could put up to 100% of planned EV plant construction and a significant portion of existing capacity at risk, according to industry analysis.

Households and local businesses will take a huge hit. A rollback of tax credits for home energy upgrades such as rooftop solar is a blow to Pennsylvanians who’ve been using these tools to cut energy bills. Incentives have made it easier for homeowners to install solar panels, save money, and even help stabilize America’s power grid. But those benefits — and the local businesses that depend on them — are in jeopardy if Congress moves forward with these cuts.

By contrast, if Congress protects clean energy tax credits, it would be a giant boost to the commonwealth’s economy over the next decade. Analysis by American Clean Power and ICF estimates that continuing clean energy incentives will be a $65 billion economic boost to our state in the next 10 years and support more than 35,000 in full-time jobs in Pennsylvania annually.

Encouragingly, a growing number of Republican members of Congress are vocalizing their support for the clean energy tax credits. Four Republican Senators recently sent a letter to leadership last month saying repeal would “lead to significant disruptions for the American people and weaken our position as a global energy leader.”

The numbers are clear: clean energy tax credits work for Pennsylvania. Undoing them now — as the House just voted to do — would be reckless and harmful. I urge Senators David McCormick and John Fetterman to work with their colleagues in the Senate to protect these tax credits.",https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/sxa7pe/picture307169911/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/37693e1d-71c5-489a-9ce3-3d0d0ee9a9a1,N,,2025-05-31 07:05:02.480858

Eguana Technologies Inc. (EGT:TSX.V; EGTYF:OTC)

In a release, BC Hydro said its new Peak Saver project will offer uninterrupted power to customers while strengthening the flexibility of the electricity grid.

The company said this spring, the installation of 200 Eguana residential batteries begins in Sun Peaks, near Kamloops, and Harrison Mills in Mission. The batteries are able to coordinate and switch to backup during power outages and supply stored energy to others during peak demand.

BC Hydro will manage the operation of the Eguana Technologies Evolve LFP 14kWh/5kW batteries remotely to ensure optimal performance during high demand.

""This important project will help us better understand how batteries can mitigate outages and help keep costs low for customers by potentially deferring the need for additional, costly capital infrastructure in certain constrained regions and areas,"" said Chris O'Riley, president and chief executive officer of BC Hydro. ""Virtual power plants are expected to play an important role in supporting electrical grids in the future, making electricity systems more resilient and flexible.""

VPPs use smart batteries at the edge of the grid (the homes and businesses that consume the energy) tied to software that helps distribute and store energy in the batteries when it's not needed and makes it available to the grid at peak times. ""The process is seamless to the consumer,"" Eguana Chief Executive Officer Justin Holland said.

'Groundbreaking Approach' to Energy Management

Adrian Dix, minister of Energy and Climate Solutions for the province, said VPPs are a ""groundbreaking approach to test the future of energy management and build a more resilient, efficient, and sustainable power grid overall.""

""This exciting Power Smart project reaffirms BC Hydro's dedication to expanding new and dynamic energy solutions and technology to redefine how communities manage and consume energy in the future,"" he said.

BC Hydro's Peak Saver programs have seen a surge in participation, the utility said, doubling since October 2024 to over 100,000 members today with Port Coquitlam, Kelowna, and Victoria leading the way in engagement. Collectively, participants have contributed to 40 megawatts (MW) in demand savings — equivalent to charging more than 40,000 electric vehicles.

Through its Peak Saver program, BC Hydro customers can also receive bill credits by reducing electricity use during brief periods of high demand, known as peak events.

""By adjusting energy consumption, participants help demand on the system while earning financial rewards,"" BC Hydro noted in its release.

Incentive options are also available, such as the Peak Saver Challenge and smart home device enrollment for things like smart thermostats, electric vehicle charges, load controllers, and home batteries.

Both the battery storage project and the Peak Saver program are part of BC Hydro’s CA$700 million expanded Energy Efficiency Plan, which increases investments in tools, technology, programs, and rebates for customers over the next three years.

Growing Interest Among Utilities for DERMS

Each installed system contributes monthly recurring revenue for Eguana through its integrated software and hardware platforms. The Evolve hardware is paired with Eguana's Exchange and Edge cloud platforms, which enable system-level control via a Distributed Energy Resource Management System (DERMS). The utility's DERMS software partner manages this grid support through coordinated charge and discharge cycles.

In addition to the progress in British Columbia, Eguana recently completed fleet-level demand response testing with a utility retailer in California. The company is also finalizing a summer rollout in Alberta to support a constrained feeder and has been invited to submit a proposal for an upcoming utility program in Ontario.

Holland has noted growing interest in integrated battery and DERMS solutions among utilities, stating, ""We can certainly feel a change in the air as more utilities move towards advanced batteries... to manage near term capacity and demand peak constraints on the grid.""

*""The rickety traditional centralized grid structure is at or close to its limits and requires transformation,"" wrote Technical Analyst Clive Maund about the company on March 24. ""The advantages of this transformation will be huge — a massive increase in capacity, vastly more efficient utilization of power generated, decreased demand on centralized power generation, and protection of the end user, corporate or private, from power outages.""

Maund said he viewed the stock as having an ""exceptionally positive risk/reward ratio"" and rated it a Strong Buy for all time horizons, with targets of CA$0.20; CA$0.60, CA$0.70, CA$1, or CA$2.

The Catalyst: Grid Stress

This summer, experts say Americans have a higher risk of finding themselves without power as extreme weather and increasing pressure from artificial intelligence (AI) and data centers could stress the grid, according to a report by The Washington Post's Evan Halper recently.

The nonprofit regulatory authority that monitors the electricity system, the North American Electric Reliability Corp., or NERC, is dedicated to reducing risks to power networks, he wrote. It said power demand is sharply up since last summer, increasing at more than double the rate it did between 2023 and 2024.

""The U.S. is now projected to need 10 gigawatts (GW) more electricity in the upcoming summer season than it did last summer — the equivalent amount of power it takes to keep the lights on in as many as 10 million homes,"" Halper wrote. ""The proliferation of energy-hungry data centers and manufacturing plants is a key cause. They are consuming energy faster than utilities can bring new power plants online. Additionally, scorching temperatures drive more air-conditioning use in homes and businesses, creating a major strain on electricity systems.""

An electrical transformer recently sent Europe's busiest airport into darkness, affecting nearly 300,000 passengers, diverting or canceling more than 1,400 flights, and costing airlines an estimated 100 million pounds in lost revenue and passenger care expenses.

Flights at London's Heathrow Airport were able to resume the next day. While the cause was ruled either human error or equipment malfunction, the incident drew attention to aging electrical grids.

Adding to the fears are recent reports that U.S. government officials have found undisclosed communication devices on the power inverters of some Chinese-manufactured solar panels that could switch them off remotely, according to a report published by Reuters.

That is what Laura Burke, the Director General of the EPA, said when she launched the Greenhouse Gas Emissions Projections Report last Wednesday.","Confirmation from the Environmental Protection Agency over the past few days that Ireland has gone backwards on its greenhouse gas emissions targets is hugely disappointing.

People are blue in the face, listening to government ministers and policy makers constantly highlighting the important of climate action and their commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

Now however, the EPA has let the cat out of the bag.

Despite all that talk, the gap to where Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions must be by 2030 is widening.

And it is not widening by a little. It is widening by a lot.

The legally binding target is for Ireland’s greenhouse gas emissions to be 51% lower, in 2030, than they were in 2018.

A year ago, EPA analysis suggested that if every realistic climate policy in the Climate Action Plan was delivered on time, ahead of 2030, it might be possible to cut emissions by 29%, at most.

Now, after receiving updates from Government departments and agencies, the EPA says the maximum reduction achievable, is only 23%.

Either number - a cut of 23% or 29% - represents a massive failure.

There is the global warming potential, and the climate damage, caused by not cutting emissions fast enough.

But there is also a huge cost to the taxpayer.

Recent analysis from the Irish Fiscal Council and the Climate Change Advisory Council suggested it could cost the taxpayer up to €26 billion for carbon credits by 2030, to make up the shortfall envisaged last year.

But now that the emissions gap is bigger, the bill to the taxpayer will be bigger too.

This feels like some kind of disaster unfolding in slow motion.

The focus must shift from policy aspiration to practical implementation

The key reason is that despite all the talk from politicians there is not enough focus on implementing and delivering the climate-related policies the government has signed up to.

That is what Laura Burke, the Director General of the EPA, said when she launched the Greenhouse Gas Emissions Projections Report last Wednesday.

""This highlights the economy-wide effort needed to decarbonise our society and the focus must shift from policy aspiration to practical implementation.""

That was how she put it.

A key paragraph on page 10 of the EPA report, goes right to the heart of why we are going backwards.

Know first, that these latest emissions projections were done on the basis of the official ""Climate Action Plan 2024"", published at the end of 2023.

On page 10 the EPA report explains that: ""Climate Action Plan 2025 is not specifically referenced in this report as it had yet to be published during the preparation phase of the 2024-2055 projections. A review was undertaken and there are no significant additional measures in CAP 2025 therefore no major omissions in these projections.""

What this paragraph is saying is that, with so few years to go before the crucial 2030 deadline, an entire year has been allowed to pass without a single important climate initiative, or effort, having been added to the policy mix.

Yet there is no time to waste.

Notwithstanding the need to constantly come up with new policy initiatives, the number one thing should be to deliver, as quickly as possible, on the climate- related commitments already made.

Delaying difficult but inevitable changes only makes them harder to implement. It will not make them go away.

'Sustainable transport'

Climate Action Plan 2023 introduced a so-called ""Avoid-Shift"" policy on transport. The aim was to introduce behavioural change and sustainable transport measures to save 2 million tonnes of carbon emissions.

Central to that was a commitment to increase the price of petrol and diesel out to 2030 to encourage people to choose other modes of transport.

So far there is no sign of any willingness by Government to follow through on that.

But if they are not going to do it, what are they going to do instead to deliver the promised emissions reduction?

Last year the target was 945,000 electric vehicles on the road by 2030. This year the EPA says the maximum possible is 640,750.

Many observers doubt even that amount can be achieved - especially since tax incentives to encourage electric vehicle purchases have been reduced in recent years.

What will the Government do to address that?

There is also a commitment in the Climate Action Plan to use behavioural and sustainable transport measures to engineer a reduction in total vehicle kilometres travelled. We are still waiting for that, and very much more.

Time is running out for climate action. We have one year less to go to an immovable deadline in 2030.

The clear message from the EPA this week is that government inaction is the core of the problem and the potential bill for the public, which is already enormous, is rising by the day.",https://www.rte.ie/images/0014c4b3-1600.jpg,N,,2025-05-31 13:10:15.888275

were also plaintiffs in a climate suit filed against the state of Montana.","A group of young people — as young as 7 and as old as 25 — are suing the Trump administration to stop its assault on renewable energy and climate action.

Executive orders President Donald Trump signed to promote fossil fuels amount to an “unconstitutional” overreach of power, they allege in a complaint filed Thursday at a US District Court in Montana. The 22 plaintiffs also claim that by increasing pollution and denying climate science, the president’s actions violate their Fifth Amendment rights to life and liberty.

It’s the latest high-profile case brought against governments by youth concerned about how fossil fuel pollution and climate change poses risks to their health and ability to thrive as they grow up.

Two brothers, aged 11 and 7, “were born into climate change-induced smoke seasons that did not exist for older generations”

Two brothers, aged 11 and 7 and named “J.K.” and “N.K.” in the suit, “were born into climate change-induced smoke seasons that did not exist for older generations and which compromise their health,” the complaint says.

They grew up mostly in Montana but now live in Southern California, and the suit says wildfire smoke has encroached on their lives from state to state. J.K. was born with an abnormal mass of lung tissue and “experienced nosebleeds, sore throats, headaches, tiredness, coughing, trouble breathing, and eye irritation from wildfire smoke,” according to the suit. N.K. has “frequent” upper respiratory infections that have led to emergency room visits. They’ve both missed school days and camp because of feeling sick from smoke and soot in the air from wildfires, it says.

Greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels trap heat, and rising temperatures have contributed to longer fire seasons in the western US. With hotter, drier conditions, the area burned by forest fires in the western US doubled between 1984 and 2015.

“Every additional ton of [greenhouse gas] pollution and increment of heat Defendants cause will cause J.K. and N.K. more days of poor air quality, more smoke, and thus, more harm to their lives, health, and safety,” the complaint adds.

In recent years, scientists have been trying to better understand the long-term health impact of wildfire smoke, which previously hadn’t been studied as thoroughly as pollution from other sources thought to be more consistent problems, like factories and highways. Now, chronic exposure to wildfire smoke is a growing concern. Wildfire smoke is considered a neurotoxin estimated to be more harmful than other common air pollutants, but its effects on the body can vary depending on what kinds of materials burn and how chemicals released by the fire interact with other substances in the atmosphere.

After campaigning on a promise to “drill, baby, drill” and accepting more than $75 million in contributions from oil and gas interests, Trump signed executive orders on his first day in office declaring a purported “national energy emergency,” directing federal agencies to “unleash” domestic fossil fuel production and promote the use of gas-powered vehicles over EVs. He signed another executive order to “reinvigorat[e]” the coal industry in April. Coal releases more planet-heating pollution when burned than other fossil fuels and has struggled to compete with cheaper sources of electricity.

The plaintiffs are seeking injunctive relief to block implementation of those executive orders and to declare them unconstitutional. They also claim that Trump lacks the authority to erode environmental protections passed by Congress under the Clean Air Act. The administration’s efforts to impede scientific research and remove climate information from federal websites amounts to “censorship” and denies plaintiffs access to resources they might otherwise be able to use to minimize risks they face from climate change, the suit alleges.

In response to the lawsuit, White House assistant press secretary Taylor Rogers said in an email to The Verge, “The American people are more concerned with the future generations’ economic and national security, which is why they elected President Trump in a landslide victory to restore America’s energy dominance. Future generations should not have to foot the bill of the lefts’ radical climate agenda.”

The plaintiffs, who hail from Montana, Oregon, Hawai‘i, California, and Florida, are represented by the nonprofit law firm Our Children’s Trust, which has also represented young people in similar climate cases. A federal appellate court dismissed another case that youth filed against the Obama administration in 2015 over fossil fuel pollution causing climate change, and the US Supreme Court ended that legal battle this year when it declined to hear an appeal.

But there have also been some wins. A group of youth reached a settlement last year with the state of Hawai‘i and its Department of Transportation that commits them to a plan to reach zero greenhouse gas emissions from transportation by 2045. J.K. and N.K. were also plaintiffs in a climate suit filed against the state of Montana. Last year, Montana’s Supreme Court upheld a district judge ruling affirming their right to a clean and healthy environment and rejecting policies that had barred officials from considering the consequences of climate change when permitting new energy projects.",https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/STK438_CLIMATE_CHANGE_C.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C10.732984293194%2C100%2C78.534031413613&w=1200,N,,2025-05-31 08:01:39.382486

John Curtis over his support for clean energy tax credits, raising the stakes for Republican leaders as they scramble to pass their massive tax reconciliation bill.

The fiscally conservative group will launch an ad series this weekend targeting a handful of GOP lawmakers over their policy stances at odds with President Donald Trump’s massive budget framework. The ad taking aim at Curtis specifically focuses on his support for preserving some green energy tax incentives passed under the Biden administration through the Inflation Reduction Act.

“Republicans were elected up and down the ballot in 2024 to reverse disastrous Biden policies — not protect them,” said Club for Growth President David McIntosh. “If the tax cut bill fails because John Curtis is against it in order to protect Biden giveaways, every family in Utah will be hit with the largest tax increase in history. We are confident his constituents in Utah will remind Sen. Curtis how misguided his approach is.”

The 30-second ad, which will run statewide beginning on Sunday, claims Curtis is threatening Trump’s plans to reverse former President Joe Biden’s signature climate policies.

The commercial specifically refers to the 1,038-page megabill making its way through Congress seeking to advance Trump’s policies on the border, energy production, national defense and more. The budget resolution also contains extensions for a slew of tax cuts set to expire at the end of this year.

The budget package greenlights about $4.5 trillion to extend the tax cuts previously approved in Trump’s 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and make them permanent. To offset those costs, lawmakers must find at least $1.5 trillion in spending cuts elsewhere.

However, internal disagreements on where to cut spending has delayed progress on the bill as some Republicans push for deep cuts while others caution against them.

One of the most controversial provisions tucked into the budget resolution is language repealing clean energy tax credits that were passed under the Biden administration with only Democratic support.

Curtis is among those pushing to preserve some of those policies, particularly those dealing with nuclear energy, net-zero emissions, battery storage and more. The first-term senator has long centered his climate policies on clean energy solutions, suggesting earlier this week he will push for those changes as the Senate considers the bill.

“We must build a thoughtful, principled bill that doesn’t pull the rug out from under American innovators,” a spokesperson for Curtis told the Deseret News. “Doing otherwise risks freezing investment, delaying domestic production, increasing costs, and forfeiting our energy edge and national security to China and Russia.”

The Club for Growth has previously targeted Curtis, spending millions of dollars on ad campaigns claiming the Utah senator is not conservative enough. But Curtis contends those big-money efforts by national groups have only boosted his message — arguing his victories over the last eight years have been a result of Utah voters rejecting out-of-state meddling in local elections.

The ad campaign targets other Republicans who have threatened to vote against Trump’s megabill, such as New York Reps. Mike Lawler and Nick LaLota, who pushed for expansions to federal deductions for state and local taxes paid, also known as SALT.

While LaLota and Lawler have outright said they would vote against the reconciliation package if it didn’t include those demands, Curtis has so far stopped short of saying he would reject the budget framework if it nixed green energy credits. Still, the Utah senator said he would fight to include them in the final bill.",https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/AYDJBAGBHNG2HNDDQLPUSFJCZA.JPG?focal=1498%2C609&auth=84ca080f00c1759126af5be6043a6bc261ad727cab9e0901287781cedf1a57ce&width=1200&height=630,N,,2025-05-31 08:01:35.383555

The first is the Pennsylvania Climate Emissions Reduction Act (PACER).
All told, Shapiro’s climate plans would soak Pennsylvanians with more than $157 billion in higher energy costs.
And when job creators face higher costs, they must cut back on hires, wages, and benefits.
He was right when he expressed concerns about RGGI’s harm to Pennsylvania families.","Gov. Josh Shapiro is a classic political flip-flopper. And his latest energy proposals demonstrate his wishy-washiness.

When he ran for the state’s highest office in 2022, Shapiro said he had “real concerns” about the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI)—the signature climate policy of his predecessor. He said he was worried the carbon-tax scheme could hit Pennsylvania families with higher costs, which it will. RGGI is expected to raise residential electric bills by 30% by 2030, killing at least 22,000 jobs in the process.

But three years later, the governor is singing a different tune. On May 13, in front of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, his administration and other environmental organizations argued that Shapiro should have the power to keep RGGI in place. So much for those “real concerns.” And forget the real damage RGGI will do to families and job creators across the commonwealth.

If Shapiro had meant what he said about RGGI’s harm, his administration would not have sought to reverse the lower court’s decision to strike it down. Instead, he proudly stands by RGGI. And that’s just the start of Josh Shapiro’s flip-flopping. Despite his worries that RGGI would make life more expensive, the governor is pushing his own Pennsylvania Green New Deal that would, just like RGGI, make life more expensive and threaten to undermine Pennsylvania’s energy leadership.

Even as he defends RGGI in court, Shapiro has called for two new climate-inspired plans. The first is the Pennsylvania Climate Emissions Reduction Act (PACER). PACER is essentially RGGI 2.0 and would enact a new system of carbon taxes that would still affect everyone in the state. The second is the Pennsylvania Reliable Energy Sustainability Standard (PRESS), which is neither reliable nor sustainable. PRESS would force the state to expand its generation mix with more mandated unreliable energy sources like wind and solar.

RGGI is harmful to Pennsylvania, but the governor’s new plan is even worse. He’s doubling down on the unreliable and unaffordable energy sources that drive costs even higher.

In a new study from the Commonwealth Foundation, we estimate that PACER and PRESS would cause a 60% rate hike across all sectors over the next 10 years. By 2035, the typical family would see a 102% increase in their household electricity bills. All told, Shapiro’s climate plans would soak Pennsylvanians with more than $157 billion in higher energy costs.

This would be an unmitigated—and totally preventable—disaster. When families pay more for utilities, they have less to spend on the things that matter most to them: a new home, a better school for their kids, their grocery budget, you name it. And when job creators face higher costs, they must cut back on hires, wages, and benefits. They also cut back on innovations and investments, like the new and improved factories that Pennsylvania needs to stay competitive.

Shapiro is darkening the state’s future—both figuratively and literally. His climate-alarmist energy plans will limit the construction of needed power plants that produce affordable and reliable energy, forcing the closure of reliable plants already on the grid. All of this at a time when we have increasing energy demands across the region and nation.

None of this would have happened if the governor had abandoned his policy contradictions and embraced energy realism rather than climate alarmism. He was right when he expressed concerns about RGGI’s harm to Pennsylvania families. The governor should abandon his PACER and PRESS plans, based on his frequent claims that he’s trying to save families money and wants Pennsylvania to continue as an energy leader.

In contrast, Josh Shapiro can keep pushing for a Pennsylvania version of the Green New Deal that will hurt the commonwealth and everyone who calls it home.

It would be better to stop the flip-flopping and start putting Pennsylvania first.

With this law, Massachusetts joins leaders like California and New York in boosting clean energy adoption.
The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) states that effective energy storage can reduce system costs.
These solutions can also cut down land use and water needs, making clean energy more environmentally friendly.
Challenges Facing Massachusetts Energy Storage Deployment Challenges like technology readiness, interconnection delays, and permitting risks might slow progress.","Massachusetts has passed a bold energy storage mandate. It requires investor-owned utilities to secure 5,000 megawatts (MW) of storage by 2030. This includes 3,500 MW of mid-duration, 750 MW of long-duration, and another 750 MW for multi-day storage. The goal is to modernize the grid and integrate renewable energy fully.

The state’s Department of Energy Resources (DOER) and electric distribution companies (EDCs) have released a draft request for proposals (RFP), expressing interest to buy 1,500 MW of mid-duration battery energy storage systems (BESS).

By locking in contracts early, the state wants a resilient energy system to handle solar and wind power fluctuations. Since renewables generate power intermittently, storage systems are vital for grid stability. The new law urges utilities to secure agreements quickly and cuts red tape by streamlining permitting and siting processes.

How Energy Storage Will Maximize Renewable Energy in Massachusetts

This mandate aims to boost renewable energy use and reduce curtailment, which is wasted clean power. By investing in storage, the state can save renewable electricity produced during sunny or windy periods. It can then use that power when needed.

Data shows that states with clear storage mandates adopt renewables 25% faster than those without. With this law, Massachusetts joins leaders like California and New York in boosting clean energy adoption.

The streamlined approval process also helps speed up clean energy project construction. Stakeholders see this as a game-changing step toward increasing renewable use while maintaining grid reliability.

This law supports the U.S. goal to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 50% by 2030. Long-duration and multi-day storage systems prevent waste of renewable energy when generation is low. Instead of relying on fossil fuels, utilities can use stored clean energy.

Storage cuts the need for “Peaker plants” that emit high carbon during peak demand. This rule, along with other clean energy investments, boosts the state’s climate action efforts.

The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) states that effective energy storage can reduce system costs. And this can be possible by improving the use of renewable energy. These solutions can also cut down land use and water needs, making clean energy more environmentally friendly.

Growth Opportunities for Battery and Long-Duration Technologies

This mandate sends a strong message to developers and investors. With a clear goal of 5,000 MW by 2030 and a solid procurement plan, Massachusetts stands out as a prime market for energy storage technologies like lithium-ion, flow batteries, iron-air systems, and thermal storage.

Experts predict U.S. storage capacity will triple by 2030. Massachusetts provides the policy certainty that attracts investment and encourages competition among developers. The state’s mixed approach to mid- and long-duration goals reflects a savvy understanding of energy demand and supply trends.

By combining firm storage targets with faster permitting, Massachusetts sets the stage for rapid deployment—a model for other states.

Challenges Facing Massachusetts Energy Storage Deployment

Challenges like technology readiness, interconnection delays, and permitting risks might slow progress. While the law cuts some bureaucratic barriers, stakeholders must balance speed with oversight.

Cost is another concern. Storage technology costs are higher than some traditional grid solutions. However, NREL expects prices to drop by 2030, especially for long-duration systems. Achieving this goal relies on innovation, market growth, and good investment conditions.

The law boosts Massachusetts’ role in the national clean energy shift. It also urges utilities to act quickly and effectively.

What Do Consumers and the Economy Gain?

Energy storage can lower electricity bills. It does this by stabilizing prices during peak demand. The law also brings economic benefits. It creates jobs in clean tech. This includes roles in manufacturing, engineering, installation, and maintenance as new projects start.

Massachusetts combines clean energy, grid reliability, and economic growth for lasting success. If done right, this policy can guide other states in modernizing their energy systems sustainably and cost-effectively.",https://carboncredits.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/shutterstock_1625103661-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-05-31 12:19:49.390640

The emergence of the EV sector and the subsequent popularity that companies like Tesla found on the global market place was all the evidence we needed.
The problems that most African nations face always comes back to the people suffering, in this instance its the infrastructure.
How have Ethiopia and East Africa become the global leaders in the EV sector?
It comes down to the fact that the African nations like Ethiopia have incentivized the EV sector heavily.","EAST AFRICA – The world’s first country to commit to 100% EVs has been unveiled and it does not come from where you expect. Of all the nations in the world that spend a lot of time talking about zero emissions and what we should be doing for the planet, Ethiopia is the last place on earth you would expect to ban the import of all gasoline powered vehicles.

Yet they have. East Africa overall has experienced a surge in investments and the nations are leaps and bounds ahead of their American or European counterparts at achieving the world’s zero emission goals.

What is the history of the electric vehicle in Africa?

Africa has always had the same problem with EV’s, infrastructure. In a continent where most people survive on a fraction of what the American earns, costs mean a lot to people. A vehicle that costs nothing to refuel and only needs the electricity from your house that you were already lucky to have was a no brainer. Africans love anything that can save money in their every day lives.

The emergence of the EV sector and the subsequent popularity that companies like Tesla found on the global market place was all the evidence we needed. The problems that most African nations face always comes back to the people suffering, in this instance its the infrastructure. With most African countries having dodgy electricity infrastructure at best, the EV struggled to find a home in Africa.

But all that is slowly(admittedly) changing. The world’s nations have all committed to a zero emission future and Ethiopia have gone further then any other nation at actually achieving it. The reason for this comes down to a few factors, chief among which is that the African economies are booming. Africa has a young population and the new generation expect different things from their governments and car manufacturers.

How have Ethiopia and East Africa become the global leaders in the EV sector?

It comes down to the fact that the African nations like Ethiopia have incentivized the EV sector heavily. They have seen the EV sector as an opportunity to lead the world. The thing is that Africa is not as dependent on gasoline as the rest of the world. In some African countries you might struggle to find gasoline even. So the opportunity is there to invest in the new infrastructure that was going to be built anyway, why not make it for EV’s?

That seems to be what Ethiopia have thought. They have officially announced that as of January 2024, they have banned the import of combustion-powered vehicles. A driving factor was certainly the countries heavy fuel bill. Ethiopia’s rapid economic growth is the fastest among all African countries south of the Sahara and this had led to huge foreign investments into the EV sector for the future.

Local African EV makers are emerging as well. Kiira Motors (Uganda), Kantanka (Ghana), and Innoson Motors (Nigeria) have all seen steady growth and will no doubt welcome the electrification of the roads in Africa. While America and Europe face the same old problems, Africa is leading the world in the embracement and implementation of the EV market.

Will Africa continue to lead the global electrification efforts towards zero emissions?

The world faces a very dark and slow future of we do not find a solution to the energy crisis, some countries have looked towards alternative fuel sources as a potential answer. The truth is that the world has the infrastructure already in place. The majority of the world have electricity in some form for their citizens, even if its only in the larger cities or built up areas, so why not improve it and use to for our mobility needs? The governments of the world treat their car owners very differently, and Ethiopia has just made their message clear, they will only except EV’s from this point onwards. And so should you.",https://mitechnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Global-electricity-demand-for-EVs-to-skyrocket-630-by-2030-1.jpg,N,,2025-05-31 12:20:44.134914

Two years and $7.6 billion later, Hyundai Motor Group Metaplant America started production of the 2025 Ioniq 5 in Georgia, almost half a year earlier than expected.
The same is true for the Hyundai Ioniq 9, the second EV model produced at the Metaplant America.
Besides the car plant, Hyundai partnered with LG Energy Solution (LGES) to build a $4 billion battery plant, which should start supplying battery cells for the Ioniq models in 2026.
The tariffs that Trump has imposed on most imports will also make it harder to operate a car factory.","Hyundai is one of the legacy carmakers that has moved the fastest in the new EV era. The Ioniq 5 has been hailed as one of the most advanced EVs for the masses, thanks to its 800-volt E-GMP architecture. However, soon after Hyundai started exporting the Ioniq 5 from its home factory in Korea, the Biden administration announced the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) with huge incentives for EV buyers and carmakers. However, the cars and most of their parts must be sourced from North America to qualify.

Hyundai suffered a lot, and sales of the Ioniq 5 dropped, even though many buyers used the lease loophole to access the tax credit. Luckily, Hyundai was already planning a new factory in the US, and the groundbreaking ceremony was scheduled for October 2022, two months after the IRA was signed. Two years and $7.6 billion later, Hyundai Motor Group Metaplant America started production of the 2025 Ioniq 5 in Georgia, almost half a year earlier than expected.

The American-made Ioniq 5 has the NACS charge port pioneered by Tesla as its most distinctive feature. This allows it to charge at Tesla Superchargers, even though Hyundai E-GMP vehicles don't charge very fast at 400-volt chargers. The same is true for the Hyundai Ioniq 9, the second EV model produced at the Metaplant America.

Besides the car plant, Hyundai partnered with LG Energy Solution (LGES) to build a $4 billion battery plant, which should start supplying battery cells for the Ioniq models in 2026. Hyundai is not putting all the eggs in one basket, which is why it will open a second battery plant in Georgia, this time in partnership with SK On, following a $5 billion investment. All these plants are part of a massive $21 billion investment plan, most of the investments pledged during the EV-friendly Biden administration.

However, things are changing fast, and although Trump still says he wants businesses to set up production facilities on US soil, his actions point to the opposite. The administration is now working to scrap IRA from 2026, meaning that many of these investments will be much more difficult to recover, if not impossible.

The tariffs that Trump has imposed on most imports will also make it harder to operate a car factory. Vehicle manufacturing is incredibly complex, and no company, not even Tesla, can produce a car without some share of imported parts. The added costs will put pressure on Hyundai's bottom line and raise car prices for everyone.

Hyundai has an important advantage here, as its Metaplant is almost fully operated by robots. Only 1,340 employees work at the plant, with initial plans to hire up to 8,500 at full capacity. Local suppliers and businesses will require another 7,000 jobs. However, things might change, and Hyundai might need fewer workers instead of more. To compete in current conditions, Hyundai will accelerate the adoption of robots, while the factory will be mostly operated by artificial intelligence.

Hyundai bought Boston Dynamics in 2020 and already uses Spot robotic dogs to enforce quality control. Soon, these will be joined by Atlas humanoid robots, able to work tirelessly, 24 hours a day. However, the robot revolution is already obvious at the plant. The welding shop uses 475 industrial robots, and many more work at the steel stamping plant, while robotic arms install car doors on the final assembly line.

This makes Hyundai's factory less of a boon for employees or even Georgia state, which invested taxpayers' money thinking about the jobs it could create. Despite plans to build 500,000 cars at the factory, far fewer jobs than expected will be needed. Ultimately, Hyundai will face a daunting job to make everyone happy while still running a successful business. However, it's more likely that everyone will be unhappy with the outcome.

To be fair, this is the direction every carmaker will take if it wants to survive, although it will be easier for some than others. Robotic production lines are nothing new, but humanoid robots will turn car factories, or any factory for that matter, into human-unfriendly environments. Carmakers may take different routes, but the destination is the same.",https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images/news/hyundai-invested-76-billion-in-a-state-of-the-art-plant-that-will-make-nobody-happy-252147_1.jpeg,N,,2025-05-31 11:03:32.783368

Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' patent-pending Prototype 2.0 successfully restored 100% of imbalance-related capacity on a real-world 96-cell Nissan Leaf battery pack, demonstrating precise cell-level voltage alignment and effective capacity recovery.

1.95 ampere-hours (Ah) of capacity was restored, representing a 3.9% increase in effective capacity on a battery pack that was relatively well-balanced, underscoring the system's potential on more degraded packs.

All 96 battery cells were rebalanced to 4.20 volts, the industry-recognized full charge state for lithium-ion batteries, validating the system's accuracy and performance.

Results support the potential scalability of Prototype 2.0 across high-volume EV platforms. The next phase of validation includes full charge/discharge testing to confirm capacity gains and assess long-term battery lifespan extension.

Battery X Metals Inc. (CSE:BATX)(OTCQB:BATXF)(FSE:5YW, WKN:A40X9W)(""Battery X Metals"" or the ""Company"") an energy transition resource exploration and technology company, announces that, further to its news release dated May 2, 2025 confirming the delivery of its second-generation, patent-pending lithium-ion battery rebalancing machine (""Prototype 2.0"") by its wholly owned subsidiary Battery X Rebalancing Technologies Inc. (""Battery X Rebalancing Technologies""), and its news releases dated May 23, 2025 and May 27, 2025, regarding expanded development efforts to achieve compatibility with the Nissan Leaf -the second most common out-of-warranty electric vehicle (EV) in the United States-Battery X Rebalancing Technologies has achieved full capacity recovery in a preliminary trial (the ""Trial"") on a retired real-world imbalanced 96-cell Nissan Leaf battery pack, composed of lithium manganese oxide (LMO) and lithium nickel oxide (LNO) materials (the ""Nissan Leaf Battery Pack"").

The Trial results (the ""Results"") were performed using Prototype 2.0 on the Nissan Leaf Battery Pack, The Nissan Leaf Battery Pack was first charged at 12 amperes using Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' cycling module to simulate a standard electric vehicle charging cycle. Once the first cell reached the voltage target of 4.20 volts (the ""Voltage Target""), a rebalancing current between 0 and 3 amperes was applied individually to the remaining cells until all 96-battery cells successfully reached the Voltage Target. The Voltage Target lies within the standard operating range for LMO and LNO lithium-ion cells of 3.0 volts to 4.20 volts, with 4.20 volts commonly recognized as the full capacity in the industry¹.

According to the diagnostic report provided by the vendor of the Nissan Leaf Battery Pack (the ""Battery Vendor Diagnostic Report""), the reported measured effective ampere-hour capacity of the Nissan Leaf Battery Pack prior to rebalancing was 50.34 ampere-hours (Ah). This served as the baseline capacity for the Trial. Following the Trial, Prototype 2.0's integrated software determined that 1.95 Ah of additional capacity had been successfully restored. While the Battery Vendor Diagnostic Report did not quantitatively indicate a loss of capacity, it indicated that the Nissan Leaf Battery Pack was operating at 50.34 Ah with minor voltage imbalance that placed the voltage below the Voltage Target. Rebalancing the cells to the Voltage Target achieved a 3.9 percent improvement in usable capacity.

The restored 1.95 Ah corresponds to the full theoretical rebalancing increase based on the Voltage Target achieved, and represents full recovery of the minor voltage imbalance indicated on the Battery Vendor Diagnostic Report. These results were determined by the Trial based on achieving the Voltage Target across all 96-battery cells, along with a software feature of Prototype 2.0 that shows the ampere-hours (Ah) capacity restored through rebalancing for each individual cell, with the largest discrepancy being 1.95 Ah, based on the Voltage Target. Battery X Rebalancing Technologies interprets this result as confirmation of Prototype 2.0's ability to restore all imbalance-induced lost capacity through precise voltage alignment and battery-cell level rebalancing.

Results

Next Steps

To further validate the Results, the Battery X Rebalancing Technologies intends to conduct further trials to complete a full charge/discharge cycle to empirically confirm whether the 50.34 ampere-hour capacity reported in the Battery Vendor Diagnostic Report remains consistent following rebalancing. Given that all 96-battery cells have been rebalanced to the Voltage Target, Battery X Rebalancing Technologies does not anticipate any material variance, and remains confident in its ability to restore all imbalance-induced lost capacity through precise voltage alignment and battery-cell level rebalancing on the Nissan Leaf Battery Pack. However, this process will provide definitive confirmation.

Additionally, the full charge/discharge cycle will help identify any potentially defective battery cells within the pack that may require replacement. While there is currently no indication of any defective cells, this diagnostic step will serve as a further safeguard in confirming the measured effective ampere-hour capacity stated in the Battery Vendor Diagnostic Report.

Battery X Rebalancing Technologies continues to rely on the Battery Vendor Diagnostic Report as a credible third-party baseline and has no reason to believe it is inaccurate. Nevertheless, Battery X Rebalancing Technologies plans to validate the report through its own independent testing protocols to ensure accuracy.

Developing Next-Generation Technologies to Support Lithium-Ion Battery Longevity

""This Trial marks a significant milestone in validating Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' technology under real-world conditions,"" said Massimo Bellini Bressi, CEO of Battery X Metals. ""Even with a relatively well-balanced Nissan Leaf battery pack, the system was able to recover nearly 2 ampere-hours of capacity - an improvement that underscores the precision and potential of our patent-pending lithium-ion rebalancing solution. As we expand testing to more aged and imbalanced battery packs, we expect to identify greater capacity losses that this technology is specifically designed to address. This is just the beginning of what battery rebalancing can offer the EV ecosystem - extending battery life, improving performance, and reducing waste.""

As disclosed in the Company's May 9, 2025 news release, Battery X Rebalancing Technologies entered into a non-commercial, collaborative scope of services agreement (the ""Factor E Agreement"") with Factor E Motors, an automobile service centre specializing in out-of-warranty Tesla vehicles. The collaboration is focused on advancing the Company's patent-pending rebalancing software and hardware, with initial efforts targeting Tesla Model 3 and Model X battery packs in Factor E's possession.

Further to the Company's May 23, 2025 news release, development efforts were expanded to include functionality for the Nissan Leaf-the second most common out-of-warranty EV model in the United States. The Results were attained from Trials performed on the Nissan Leaf Battery Pack acquired from an arm's-length third party for $1,120.

The Trial was performed in collaboration with Factor E Motors, and in addition to conducting a full charge/discharge cycle to empirically confirm the Battery Vendor Diagnostic Report, Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' is now focused on ongoing validation of standard operating procedures (SOPs) and post-rebalancing processes.

News Release Highlights:

Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' patent-pending Prototype 2.0 successfully restored 100% of imbalance-related capacity on a real-world 96-cell Nissan Leaf battery pack, demonstrating precise cell-level voltage alignment and effective capacity recovery.

1.95 ampere-hours (Ah) of capacity was restored, representing a 3.9% increase in effective capacity on a battery pack that was relatively well-balanced, underscoring the system's potential on more degraded packs.

All 96 battery cells were rebalanced to 4.20 volts, the industry-recognized full charge state for lithium-ion batteries, validating the system's accuracy and performance.

Results support the potential scalability of Prototype 2.0 across high-volume EV platforms. The next phase of validation includes full charge/discharge testing to confirm capacity gains and assess long-term battery lifespan extension.

Battery X Metals Inc. (CSE:BATX)(OTCQB:BATXF)(FSE:5YW, WKN:A40X9W)(""Battery X Metals"" or the ""Company"") an energy transition resource exploration and technology company, announces that, further to its news release dated May 2, 2025 confirming the delivery of its second-generation, patent-pending lithium-ion battery rebalancing machine (""Prototype 2.0"") by its wholly owned subsidiary Battery X Rebalancing Technologies Inc. (""Battery X Rebalancing Technologies""), and its news releases dated May 23, 2025 and May 27, 2025, regarding expanded development efforts to achieve compatibility with the Nissan Leaf -the second most common out-of-warranty electric vehicle (EV) in the United States-Battery X Rebalancing Technologies has achieved full capacity recovery in a preliminary trial (the ""Trial"") on a retired real-world imbalanced 96-cell Nissan Leaf battery pack, composed of lithium manganese oxide (LMO) and lithium nickel oxide (LNO) materials (the ""Nissan Leaf Battery Pack"").

The Trial results (the ""Results"") were performed using Prototype 2.0 on the Nissan Leaf Battery Pack, The Nissan Leaf Battery Pack was first charged at 12 amperes using Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' cycling module to simulate a standard electric vehicle charging cycle. Once the first cell reached the voltage target of 4.20 volts (the ""Voltage Target""), a rebalancing current between 0 and 3 amperes was applied individually to the remaining cells until all 96-battery cells successfully reached the Voltage Target. The Voltage Target lies within the standard operating range for LMO and LNO lithium-ion cells of 3.0 volts to 4.20 volts, with 4.20 volts commonly recognized as the full capacity in the industry¹.

According to the diagnostic report provided by the vendor of the Nissan Leaf Battery Pack (the ""Battery Vendor Diagnostic Report""), the reported measured effective ampere-hour capacity of the Nissan Leaf Battery Pack prior to rebalancing was 50.34 ampere-hours (Ah). This served as the baseline capacity for the Trial. Following the Trial, Prototype 2.0's integrated software determined that 1.95 Ah of additional capacity had been successfully restored. While the Battery Vendor Diagnostic Report did not quantitatively indicate a loss of capacity, it indicated that the Nissan Leaf Battery Pack was operating at 50.34 Ah with minor voltage imbalance that placed the voltage below the Voltage Target. Rebalancing the cells to the Voltage Target achieved a 3.9 percent improvement in usable capacity.

The restored 1.95 Ah corresponds to the full theoretical rebalancing increase based on the Voltage Target achieved, and represents full recovery of the minor voltage imbalance indicated on the Battery Vendor Diagnostic Report. These results were determined by the Trial based on achieving the Voltage Target across all 96-battery cells, along with a software feature of Prototype 2.0 that shows the ampere-hours (Ah) capacity restored through rebalancing for each individual cell, with the largest discrepancy being 1.95 Ah, based on the Voltage Target. Battery X Rebalancing Technologies interprets this result as confirmation of Prototype 2.0's ability to restore all imbalance-induced lost capacity through precise voltage alignment and battery-cell level rebalancing.

Results

Next Steps

To further validate the Results, the Battery X Rebalancing Technologies intends to conduct further trials to complete a full charge/discharge cycle to empirically confirm whether the 50.34 ampere-hour capacity reported in the Battery Vendor Diagnostic Report remains consistent following rebalancing. Given that all 96-battery cells have been rebalanced to the Voltage Target, Battery X Rebalancing Technologies does not anticipate any material variance, and remains confident in its ability to restore all imbalance-induced lost capacity through precise voltage alignment and battery-cell level rebalancing on the Nissan Leaf Battery Pack. However, this process will provide definitive confirmation.

Additionally, the full charge/discharge cycle will help identify any potentially defective battery cells within the pack that may require replacement. While there is currently no indication of any defective cells, this diagnostic step will serve as a further safeguard in confirming the measured effective ampere-hour capacity stated in the Battery Vendor Diagnostic Report.

Battery X Rebalancing Technologies continues to rely on the Battery Vendor Diagnostic Report as a credible third-party baseline and has no reason to believe it is inaccurate. Nevertheless, Battery X Rebalancing Technologies plans to validate the report through its own independent testing protocols to ensure accuracy.

Developing Next-Generation Technologies to Support Lithium-Ion Battery Longevity

""This Trial marks a significant milestone in validating Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' technology under real-world conditions,"" said Massimo Bellini Bressi, CEO of Battery X Metals. ""Even with a relatively well-balanced Nissan Leaf battery pack, the system was able to recover nearly 2 ampere-hours of capacity - an improvement that underscores the precision and potential of our patent-pending lithium-ion rebalancing solution. As we expand testing to more aged and imbalanced battery packs, we expect to identify greater capacity losses that this technology is specifically designed to address. This is just the beginning of what battery rebalancing can offer the EV ecosystem - extending battery life, improving performance, and reducing waste.""

As disclosed in the Company's May 9, 2025 news release, Battery X Rebalancing Technologies entered into a non-commercial, collaborative scope of services agreement (the ""Factor E Agreement"") with Factor E Motors, an automobile service centre specializing in out-of-warranty Tesla vehicles. The collaboration is focused on advancing the Company's patent-pending rebalancing software and hardware, with initial efforts targeting Tesla Model 3 and Model X battery packs in Factor E's possession.

Further to the Company's May 23, 2025 news release, development efforts were expanded to include functionality for the Nissan Leaf-the second most common out-of-warranty EV model in the United States. The Results were attained from Trials performed on the Nissan Leaf Battery Pack acquired from an arm's-length third party for $1,120.

The Trial was performed in collaboration with Factor E Motors, and in addition to conducting a full charge/discharge cycle to empirically confirm the Battery Vendor Diagnostic Report, Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' is now focused on ongoing validation of standard operating procedures (SOPs) and post-rebalancing processes. This includes conducting pre- and post-rebalancing diagnostics and supporting the execution of the rebalancing process. These efforts are intended to refine commercial workflows and further enhance Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' proprietary rebalancing technology in preparation for broader deployment.

These Results mark a critical step in validating system compatibility across diverse battery chemistries and configurations, particularly in high-volume EV models nearing or beyond the end of their manufacturer warranties. Management believes the Results demonstrate both the technical effectiveness and commercial potential of the Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' patent-pending rebalancing platform.

Read also: Challenges and Alternatives in President Trump’s Tariff Strategy

Various EOs are relevant to the propane industry. As global economics is a key market condition that will influence changes in the price of products like propane, commercial propane supplier DCC Propane, LLC, has analyzed the initial reaction to the announcements:

The EOs which will be felt by the propane industry

Of the dozens of EOs released by President Trump, those that will grab the attention of businesses tied to the propane industry and their consumers, in particular, include actions to:

Adjust the tariffs that affect the energy sector to increase the competitiveness seen within both domestic and international markets.

Declare an energy emergency in which high energy prices have been put under the spotlight.

Increase and streamline energy infrastructure and production domestically by simplifying permitting processes and reducing regulatory barriers.

Promote energy choice and appliance neutrality by introducing policies that aim to prevent favoritism toward a single energy source or appliance to create a level playing field in the market.

Reallocate federal grants that were previously only focused on electric vehicles to create more opportunities for the research and development of alternative energy initiatives.

How President Trump’s EOs could affect the propane market for the better

Another EO to note is President Trump’s signing establishing the National Energy Dominance Council. A fact sheet on the official White House site details how this move can be positive for the USA.

Detailed as a means for “positioning American energy for the next century,” this EO looks to develop American energy resources in a way that will allow the nation to rely less on foreign entities.

According to another section of the fact sheet, “American energy dominance is the most reliable way to ensure the stability and affordability of American energy prices.”

Recent history should provide some comfort for how President Trump can empower energy production in the USA. After all, during President Trump’s initial term in the White House, the country became a net exporter of energy for the first time in almost 70 years.

President Trump’s first term saw millions of acres of land across the USA opened up for the development of domestic energy, many new energy jobs created throughout the nation, and American families saving $2,500 on average per year on their gas and utility costs.

Speaking recently at the CERAWeek by S&P Global conference, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum acknowledged that the USA’s abundant natural resources significantly outweigh the $36 trillion that the nation is in debt.

Mr. Burgum went on to claim that the country’s 10-year long-term interest rate would decrease if financial markets were given the opportunity to understand the value of the USA’s natural resources. He pointed out: “The interest rates right now are one of the most significant expenses we have as a country.

“So, one of the things that we have to do is unleash America’s balance sheet, and President Trump is helping us do that.”

Concerns in the propane industry about the EOs

There are some trepidations surrounding the introduction of these EOs though.

The National Propane Gas Association (NPGA), which is going to be working to make sure the EOs are implemented throughout each sector that the organization works in on behalf of the propane industry, had a pair of primary concerns.

As outlined by NPGA’s President and CEO Steve Kaminski and reported on by LP Gas Magazine, one of these concerns is the tariffs which will be placed on equipment and parts that arrive in the USA from across the globe to then be used by businesses in the propane industry.

“Steel tanks and cylinders manufactured outside of the United States and sold into the United States will get slapped with this 25 percent tariff. This is impacting a number of manufacturer members.”

Another concern of the NPGA is going to be the tariffs on propane that is coming into the USA from Canada. This is because the association lists annual cross-border propane sales from Canada into the USA to amount to $1.9 billion, but a ten percent tariff will work out at $190 million per year.

President Trump’s increase in tariffs on goods from China to 125 percent and Beijing’s imposing tariffs of 84 percent on US imports at the start of April have also led to speculation about how these moves may impact the US propane industry.

As reported on by Reuters, industry insiders have commented that Chinese petrochemical makers, which currently purchase $11 billion of US propane per year, look set to reduce output or shut for maintenance in the very near future because of tariffs on US imports driving up costs.

NPGA stated that it will monitor how President Trump and his administration approach tariffs. Though Kaminski did add: “This is one of our top priorities, but we also have a massive opportunity with this new administration, with the new appointees to the Department of Energy, Department of Transportation and EPA, which are all pro-energy choice, and with the new Congress.

“We have as good of an opportunity over the next several months as we’ve had in a long time to position propane very well in the future.”

Next steps for businesses and consumers

As propane has become one of the talking points following the announcement of President Trump’s EOs, Chris Daly, COO at DCC Propane, LLC, believes that businesses and consumers should investigate the benefits of using this gas without delay.

He advised: “Start by evaluating your energy needs. Switching to propane can assist with many business operations and provide heating solutions around facilities. Getting in touch with a propane supplier will also help you understand the cost-saving options of switching or expanding the use of propane.

“As domestic energy infrastructure and production is set to increase and be streamlined through President Trump’s EOs, make sure you are keeping up to date about any legislative changes and incentives that could be introduced across the nation which will affect the price and availability of propane.”",https://i0.wp.com/www.globaltrademag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/PropaneShipped.jpg?fit=1000%2C666&ssl=1,N,,2025-05-31 07:05:28.982155

Climate change is even jacking up your grocery bill as farmers struggle to grow crops in fluctuating conditions.
Tallying Up the Bill: The most acute losses caused by climate change are typically related to storms and wildfires.
During former President Joe Biden’s term, it was upped to $190 per ton to reflect inflation and worsening climate change.
“Prioritizing policies like forest management and flood mitigation is far more impactful than obsessing over vague climate change goals.","The price of climate change is high—and the bill is only getting steeper as temperatures continue to rise, economists say.

A recent report compiled by risk management experts with the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries and the University of Exeter in England found that the global economy could experience a 50 percent loss in gross domestic product between 2070 and 2090 due to climate change, based on current emissions trends.

But this isn’t just a far-off risk. Economic shocks from climate change are already rattling markets around the world.

In the U.S. alone, extreme weather costs roughly $150 billion each year from direct impacts such as damage to infrastructure, agricultural losses and widespread injuries, according to a 2023 federal assessment. The impacts of warming trickle down to a number of industries, from insurance to healthcare. Climate change is even jacking up your grocery bill as farmers struggle to grow crops in fluctuating conditions.

Despite mounting evidence of this staggering price tag, the Trump administration released a memo earlier in May directing federal agencies to stop considering the economic damage caused by climate change when writing regulations, unless it is explicitly required by law. When countries don’t account for these economic costs, it has dangerous consequences for their citizens, warns André Corrêa do Lago, the Brazilian diplomat who will head this year’s UN climate summit.

Tallying Up the Bill: The most acute losses caused by climate change are typically related to storms and wildfires.

Let’s take a look at the numbers: When Hurricane Helene hit the Southern U.S. last September, the damage was catastrophic. Severe flooding, landslides and their aftermath killed at least 250 people, damaged tens of thousands of homes in western North Carolina and hindered businesses across the region that rely on tourism dollars. Shortly after, Hurricane Milton hit Florida and tore through agricultural areas and buildings, including Tropicana Field, where the stadium’s fabric roof was ripped clean off by high winds.

Combined, the two storms caused an estimated $113 billion in direct damage, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

The fires that burned through Los Angeles County early this year caused an estimated $250 billion in direct damages, one of the costliest weather-related disasters in U.S. history, The Los Angeles Times reports. In response to increasingly severe hurricanes and wildfires, insurance companies have jacked up premiums across the country for homeowners in recent decades, which I wrote about in April. Meanwhile, longer-term climate risks such as the spread of ticks and mosquitos, which carry illnesses such as Lyme disease and West Nile virus, have triggered a rise in costly medical visits, research shows.

As these impacts unfold, economists and actuaries are sounding the alarm. Since climate change pervades nearly every facet of society, it can be difficult to calculate warming’s exact economic impacts over the long term. But in recent years, financial experts have developed complex models and analyzed historical data to start adding up the bill.

The January report authored by the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries and University of Exeter found that the world is facing an increasing risk of “planetary insolvency,” when ecosystems become so degraded that they can no longer help prop up human society.

“You can’t have an economy without a society, and a society needs somewhere to live,” lead author Sandy Trust, former chair of the IFoA’s sustainability board, said in a press release. “Nature is our foundation, providing food, water and air, as well as the raw materials and energy that power our economy. Threats to the stability of this foundation are risks to future human prosperity which we must take action to avoid.”

Another key metric in climate economics is known as the social cost of carbon. This calculation measures the dollar cost of damages that ensue when one extra ton of carbon dioxide is emitted into the atmosphere. The Obama administration formally introduced this concept into U.S. regulatory policy, measuring the social cost of carbon at about $40 a ton.

So what does that look like in practice? One example is fuel efficiency standards. Though they can be costly to enact, the social cost of carbon analysis shows that the benefits to society outweighed the expense. That calculation was part of the rationale behind the Obama administration’s decision to finalize efficiency standards at 54.5 miles per gallon for cars and light-duty trucks by model year 2025.

Shifting Policies: Not every president has the same approach when it comes to the social cost of carbon. During the first Trump administration, the social cost of carbon was dropped to less than $5 per ton. During former President Joe Biden’s term, it was upped to $190 per ton to reflect inflation and worsening climate change.

Now, the White House has ordered federal agencies to scrap the metric altogether, unless it is “plainly required” by law, according to a recent memo issued by Jeffrey B. Clark, the acting administrator of the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs. In the memo, Clark said too many uncertainties come with this metric, including “whether and to what degree any supposed changes in the climate are actually occurring as a consequence of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions.”

A number of economists and environmental groups condemned the move and this rationale, which they say goes directly against the abundance of data that reflects the economic hits countries have taken in the face of global warming, E&E News reports. Ignoring the social cost of carbon in regulatory decisions could have major real-world consequences, David Cash, the former New England regional administrator for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, said in a recent interview with the public radio program Living on Earth.

“It would allow the [EPA], for example, to diminish the effectiveness of regulations so that cars could pollute more, factories could pollute more,” he said. “Gas plants and coal plants could produce more. All of which would increase the chance of greater storms, greater flooding, greater wildfires, greater drought, greater incidence of incredibly hot days in the summer where people will get more cases of asthma, more respiratory disease—all of those kinds of things. It will have a real world impact.”

I reached out to the White House to ask about the motivation behind this decision.

“For decades, the federal government has prioritized vague climate change goals over real disaster resilience and mitigation – policies that can prevent devastating tragedy during natural disasters,” White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said in an emailed statement. “Prioritizing policies like forest management and flood mitigation is far more impactful than obsessing over vague climate change goals. The Trump administration is preventing short and long-term damage to families, communities, and our economy.”

Since Inauguration Day, the Trump administration has made cuts to programs that help support state efforts to protect homes and other buildings from extreme weather. That includes the termination of the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program, which has helped cities and towns prepare for disasters through measures such as raising roads to protect against flooding, The Associated Press reports.

On the forest front, President Donald Trump issued an executive order in early March to increase domestic timber production, which my colleague Kiley Bense covered. Conservation groups warn that this move—which will expedite the permitting process—could increase wildfire risks and hurt ecosystems’ ability to absorb carbon emissions.

Meanwhile, NOAA announced earlier this month that it will no longer update a database that tracks the economic toll of climate-related weather events that cause billions of dollars in damages. A NOAA spokesperson told me that the decision was made in “alignment with evolving priorities and staffing changes.”

At times, Trump has argued that climate impacts could be positive for people in the U.S.

“The biggest threat is not global warming, where the ocean is going to rise one-eighth of an inch over the next 400 years … and you’ll have more oceanfront property,” Trump said in an August discussion with Tesla owner Elon Musk. The Hill pointed out that sea levels are projected to rise between 10 to 12 inches over the next three decades, according to a 2022 federal report.

Other countries such as Australia and Russia have also failed to comprehensively incorporate climate change’s costs into national policies, environmental groups say.

Corrêa do Lago said in a recent interview with The Guardian that “economic denial” is the latest opposition strategy to climate action. He plans to make a push for governments to remodel the economy to transition away from fossil fuels and toward renewable energy, partially to avoid economic hits.

“Most of the answers have to come from the economy,” Corrêa do Lago told The Guardian. “Because we have now enough science, enough demonstration of how climate change can affect people’s lives. Now we need answers [in the form of policy measures]. We need economists to rally.”

On Wednesday, a large piece of rock and ice from a glacier collapsed in Switzerland, triggering a landslide that smothered most of a hillside village, Tammy Webber reports for The Associated Press. Scientists say the rock above the Birch Glacier had become unstable as permafrost on the mountain melted, making the formation too heavy to hold. The local government in this area had evacuated the village, located in the Valais region, earlier this month as a precaution, but authorities say that a man is still missing in the wake of the landslide.

The collapse occurred on the same day a regional civil court in Germany dismissed a Peruvian farmer’s claim that he and his community—threatened by melting glaciers—have been harmed by climate change driven by a German energy company’s emissions. But the court said German law does permit these types of claims.

A U.S. Supreme Court ruling on Thursday could narrow the scope of environmental reviews required for major infrastructure projects such as pipelines and railways, my colleague Lisa Sorg reports. The case centered around a proposed 88-mile railway in Utah, which was approved by the Surface Transportation Board in 2021 after they conducted a review of its potential harms to the environment, a requirement under the National Environmental Policy Act. Environmental groups and a Colorado county sued the agency, claiming that their assessment did not consider all the risks to nearby ecosystems, such as oil spills and wildfires.

“A 1970 legislative acorn has grown over the years into a judicial oak that has hindered infrastructure development,” Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote in an opinion for five of the justices. (Three others signed on to a concurring opinion.) “Fewer projects make it to the finish line. Indeed, fewer projects make it to the starting line.”

Environmental groups such as Earthjustice and the Sierra Club are dismayed at the outcome and say it could open the door for more projects that hurt the environment and local communities.

Pharmaceutical company Moderna announced on Wednesday that the Trump administration canceled a $590 million federal contract to develop a bird flu vaccine for humans, Reuters reports. The contract was awarded by the Biden administration in January to prepare response efforts to the rapidly spreading, highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza, which has transferred from animals to humans several times within the past year.

A spokesperson from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, headed by vaccine skeptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr., told Reuters that the project had not met scientific standards or safety expectations.

Those two projects were worth a combined $102.4 million.
The announcement comes roughly two weeks after the Energy Department moved to audit more than $15 billion in grants and other support awarded by the Biden administration for upgrading power grids and manufacturing energy technology.
It also follows an internal agency proposal to shut down the $27 billion clean energy office, which under former President Joe Biden provided billions for a network of hydrogen hubs, carbon capture projects and other clean energy technology.
Also eliminated was $270 million to Calpine subsidiary Sutter CCUS for another carbon capture project near Yuba City, California.","The Energy Department is canceling some $3.7 billion in government support for clean energy projects, including two in Ohio, that it said did not warrant continued backing from the Trump administration.

The agency said the move came after it found the projects “failed to advance the energy needs of the American people, were not economically viable and would not generate a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars.”

The Ohio projects canceled were from Libbey Glass in Toledo and Owens-Brockway Glass Container in Zanesville. Those two projects were worth a combined $102.4 million. (The full list is below.)

Sixteen of the 24 projects were awarded during the Biden administration between Election Day and President Donald Trump’s Jan. 20 inauguration, the department said in a statement.

Among the canceled awards was $331 million to Exxon Mobil Corp. for a project to use hydrogen instead of natural gas at the company’s Baytown, Texas, Olefins Plant; $170 million to Kraft Heinz Co. for a series of clean energy projects; and $500 million to Heidelberg Materials AG for a low-carbon cement project, according to a list provided by the Energy Department.

The announcement comes roughly two weeks after the Energy Department moved to audit more than $15 billion in grants and other support awarded by the Biden administration for upgrading power grids and manufacturing energy technology. Under an audit policy announced May 15, the department told beneficiaries of agency grants and support that they must quickly comply with requests for information or risk cancellation.

It also follows an internal agency proposal to shut down the $27 billion clean energy office, which under former President Joe Biden provided billions for a network of hydrogen hubs, carbon capture projects and other clean energy technology.

Under an internal plan to eliminate the agency, billions of dollars for hydrogen hubs would have been eliminated as well as carbon capture and battery storage projects. Also slated for termination was a direct air capture project by a subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum Corp. that had been selected for an award of as much as $1.2 billion by the Biden administration.

Other canceled awards announced Friday included $375 million to Eastman Chemical Co. for a molecular recycling project in Longview, Texas; and $270 million to a subsidiary of Calpine Corp. for work on a carbon capture project at Exxon’s Baytown facility. Also eliminated was $270 million to Calpine subsidiary Sutter CCUS for another carbon capture project near Yuba City, California.

“While the previous administration failed to conduct a thorough financial review before signing away billions of taxpayer dollars, the Trump administration is doing our due diligence to ensure we are utilizing taxpayer dollars to strengthen our national security, bolster affordable, reliable energy sources and advance projects that generate the highest possible return on investment,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in the statement.",https://s3-prod.crainscleveland.com/styles/1200x630/s3/433914432.jpg,N,,2025-05-31 15:05:42.145519

Toyota Boshoku America (TBA) worked with Onyx Renewables to create the ground-mounted solar array on 17 acres adjacent to TBA’s manufacturing facility in Lawrenceville, Illinois. The manufacturing facility creates automotive interiors, particularly doors and seat assembly components, for the Toyota Highlander and Sequoia models.

The newly completed solar array is expected to fulfil 85% of electricity needs of the TBA Lawrenceville plant. Onyx Renewables is owner and operator of the solar farm, while Sol Systems and Nelnet Renewable Energy also participated in the collaborative effort.

""This is the kind of collaborative clean energy development that drives real progress and public support,"" said Patty Rollin, Chief Commercial Officer at Onyx Renewables, in a statement. ""Together with our partners, we are thrilled to deliver a project that reduces emissions, lowers energy costs, and sets a high standard for workforce development.""

Nelnet Renewable Energy handled engineering, procurement and construction contractor duties on the Toyota Boshoku distributed energy project. The solar array could generate up to 9.5 million kWh of electricity in its first year, project developers say.

""This project reflects our commitment to reducing our carbon footprint and our dedication to supporting the communities where we operate. It is also a significant step towards our goal of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050,"" said Ryan Hunt, vice president of TBA. ""We're proud to partner with companies like Onyx, Sol Systems, and Nelnet to bring clean, reliable energy to Lawrenceville.""

Sol Systems originated and mobilized the on-site power project. Sol also will plant a pollinator-friendly habitat around the solar system.

Onyx worked with the Illinois Department of Natural Resources on choosing the types of plants and seeds for the habitat.

Toyota Boshoku America is hardly the first automobile industry firm to embrace on-site power. Sprocket Power completed microgrids at five New York dealerships with Honda, Toyota and GMC affiliations.

TBA employs more than 14,000 people in 23 manufacturing locations around the U.S.

“Based in part on initial public input, USACE determined that the proposed Project could

significantly affect the quality of the human environment, and that the Department of the Army permit decision is a major federal action requiring preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement,” read the released statement.

“The EIS identifies and assesses a reasonable range of alternatives, as well as the direct, indirect, and cumulative environmental consequences of those alternatives, in order to identify options to avoid and minimize detrimental effects on the quality of the human environment.”

“The Line 5 Tunnel Project is a proposal by Enbridge Energy, Limited Partnership (Enbridge) to construct a tunnel beneath the Straits of Mackinac in Lake Michigan,” said Carrie Fox, public affairs specialist for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

“The tunnel would house a replacement segment of Enbridge’s Line 5 pipeline, which transports crude oil and natural gas liquids. The Detroit District is reviewing Enbridge’s permit application (File LRE-2010-00463-56-A19) pursuant to Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 and Section 404 of the Clean Water Act for a Department of the Army permit.”

The Environmental Impact Statement is meant to assess potential impacts of building a tunnel around Line 5 across the Straits, as well as potential impacts of project alternatives such as installing a layer of gravel over the existing pipeline.

The potential impacts being considered are to land use and recreation, aesthetics, water resources, biological resources, cultural resources, geology, soils, transporation and navigation, air quality, noise and vibration, socioeconomics, reliability and safety.

“In addition to its consideration of cultural resources in the EIS, the Corps of Engineers is separately evaluating impacts to historic properties, as well as impact avoidance, minimization, and mitigation measures, in accordance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act,” said Fox.

“The Corps of Engineers is also conducting a treaty rights analysis in consultation with federally recognized Tribes to determine if the proposed Line 5 Tunnel Project would impinge upon or abrogate treaty rights. Findings of the Section 106 process and treaty rights analysis will be presented in the Record of Decision following release of the Final EIS.”

“The Detroit District continues to prepare the Final EIS and comply with all applicable legal and policy requirements, including its federal trust responsibility to Tribal Nations, the National Historic Preservation Act, the Endangered Species Act, and the National Environmental Policy Act,” said Detroit District Commander Lt. Col. Wallace Bandeff. “These processes will inform the District’s permit decision.”

This Draft Environmental Impact Statement has been released after years of talk and initial comments, a summary of which can be found in Appendix B of the DEIS, which is linked at the bottom of this article. Common themes of public comment include concerns about pipeline safety and spills, public health and safety and greenhouse gas emissions.

“Enbridge has a long history of accidents, spills, and inadequate cleanup,” reads one of the comment summaries under the topic heading of “Comments on the Applicant (Enbridge)” in the released Draft Environmental Impact Statement. “Degradation of their systems has gone unreported. Enbridge is responsible for the two largest inland oil spills in U.S. history, and has a long record of negligence, regulatory violations, and cover ups.

We thought they were scary because they didn’t make any noise. Those electric cars had a very small range and gradually disappeared by the mid 1930s.

Now, my daughter and her husband have two cars, one electric and one gasoline. The electric car is for local trips and the other for longer excursions. They have installed a level 2 charger in their garage.

A trip of 100 miles with the Bolt costs $3.07, a little less if charged at night.

The Spark, a gasoline powered Chevrolet with a similar body, costs $9.69 for the same trip, at 33 miles/gallon at $3.20/gallon. Using these present rates for electricity and gasoline, the electric vehicle reduces travel costs by 68%.

Furthermore, in five years there has been no maintenance or repair costs on the Bolt, while regular maintenance of the gas-powered car has been about $100/year. I conclude that electric cars are an excellent choice for commuting or other local uses; the limitation is the availability to high-speed charging stations in Montana.

Now is a good time to buy an electric vehicle, with a government incentive of up to $7,500 for a new electric car and up to $4,000 for a used one.

Ask Sens. Steve Daines and Tim Sheehy and Rep. Ryan Zinke to keep the EV credits in the reconciliation package so more people can drive electric and save money.

""This so-called 'big, beautiful bill' is nothing short of a big, bad blow to America's clean energy economy and a huge amount jobs across the country,"" said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer D- N.Y.

""If Republicans succeed in gutting these tax credits, it will mean higher monthly energy bills for families and small businesses, fewer jobs for hardworking Americans, and a dangerous step backward in innovation on energy.""

In April Republican Senators Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, John Curtis of Utah, Thom Tillis of N.C. and Jerry Moran of Kansas sent a letter to Senate Majority Leader John Thune, S.D., cautioning against the full-scale repeal of current green energy credits.

Municipal bond issuers and the public power industry have been tapping green energy credits and turning them into cash thanks to provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act that allows non-profit organizations to access the elective pay program.

OBBBA also contains an increase of the SALT cap deduction to $40,000 for people making under $500,000 with annual 1% increases through 2033. The current limit is $10,000 and is set to expire at the end of the year with the rest of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

Buying a car: Bottom line Even if the proposed car loan tax deduction becomes law, car buyers shouldn’t lose sight of the bigger financial picture.","Last year, data show Americans drove away from dealerships with more than 15 million new vehicles, with roughly 80% of buyers reportedly relying on financing to purchase. So far in 2025, average car prices are about $48,000, according to Kelley Blue Book, with interest rates for car loans hovering around an average of 8.64%.

For a 5-year loan, that roughly translates to $187 a month just in interest. For those who need a new car, those costs can strain budgets.

Now, a new proposal out of the U.S. House of Representatives would, if approved, ease that burden by allowing borrowers to deduct auto loan interest from their taxes. In its version of Trump’s One Big, Beautiful bill, the House GOP offers a tax deduction for car loan interest.

But while the plan sounds like it would provide savings, it’s important to note that not every car or buyer would qualify for the tax benefit. So, if you’re thinking about buying a new car, here’s what you need to know.

‘Big, Beautiful Bill’ car loan interest deduction proposed

Last week, Republican lawmakers in the House of Representatives passed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

That mega legislation, which now advances to the U.S. Senate for approval, is designed primarily to extend or make permanent tax breaks from Trump’s 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA).

Here’s how the proposed auto loan interest deduction in the House GOP bill would work:

If passed, the measure would temporarily let car buyers write off up to $10,000 a year in interest paid on qualifying auto loans

The tax break would start with purchases made in 2025 and run through 2028.

You wouldn’t have to itemize to claim the deduction.

But not every buyer or vehicle would qualify for the tax break.

To qualify, the car must be assembled in the United States — a rule some industry manufacturers say would exclude many popular imports. (Think popular models from Honda, Hyundai, Nissan, and Toyota.)

The deduction would also start to phase out for individuals earning more than $100,000 or couples making over $200,000.

Higher-income households would see less benefit.

If the bill becomes law (the House passed its version of the legislation, but the Senate and the President must also approve the proposal), these changes would apply to loans taken out in 2025 and after, but just for three years, through 2028.

Who benefits from the auto loan deduction?

Supporters of the deduction argue it would provide direct financial relief to car buyers at a time when both vehicle prices and interest rates remain high.

Rep. Bill Huizenga (R-Mich.), who introduced the Made in America Motors Act, which proposed a similar but lower tax break, called the deduction “a win for American taxpayers, auto workers, and Michigan.”

Huizenga noted in a statement that making car loan interest tax-deductible fulfills a Trump presidential campaign promise and “provides financial motivation for individuals and families to purchase American-made vehicles.”

Sen. Bernie Moreno (R-Ohio) sponsored a bill with a similar proposal, the USA CAR Act.

“Thanks to President Trump, we are finally ensuring every car sold in America is made in America and that working Americans can actually afford to buy a car in the first place. I’m proud to lead the way in the Senate,” Moreno said when introducing his bill.

Proponents also stress that, as mentioned, the deduction is structured as an above-the-line benefit, so taxpayers can claim it even if they claim the standard deduction on their federal returns.

Some advocates also see the measure as a way to incentivize buying U.S.-assembled vehicles.

Meanwhile, others question how much relief the deduction would actually provide and whether it is the most effective way to help car buyers.

Jonathan Smoke, chief economist at automotive services and technology provider Cox Automotive, and his team reportedly analyzed the proposed auto loan interest deduction. They found that if the average car owner pays $2,000 in interest over a year, they could save about $400 on their taxes under the House proposal.

However, given the overall costs of buying a car, Smoke told Bankrate the company doesn’t “think [the car loan tax deduction is] as exciting a proposition for driving more vehicle sales.”

There are also concerns about the deduction’s fairness and fiscal impact.

The benefit phases out for higher-income households, but some analysts argue that those with the means to buy new cars, especially more expensive models, are more likely to benefit.

On the other hand, many lower-income buyers and those purchasing used or imported vehicles could be left out.

And then there’s the cost: the Joint Committee on Taxation estimates the provision would cost over $57 billion in lost federal revenue, raising questions about its broader economic trade-offs.

EV tax credit 2025?

It looks like electric vehicles could qualify for the proposed car loan interest deduction, provided they meet the same requirements as other vehicles under the House bill.

Also, the deduction doesn’t seem limited by vehicle type, so qualifying EVs and plug-in hybrids would likely be eligible if they are U.S.-assembled and the loan meets the bill’s other requirements.

But it’s worth noting that while the House GOP tax bill proposes a new tax break for U.S.-assembled vehicles, the legislation would end the up to $7,500 federal EV tax credit for new electric vehicles and $4,000 for used EVs after this year.

That is much earlier than the 2032 expiration initially set by the Inflation Reduction Act, passed during the Biden administration.

If the provision becomes law, only a small number of new EVs from manufacturers that haven't yet sold 200,000 qualifying vehicles would remain eligible for one additional year.

In addition to ending these credits, the bill would introduce new annual fees: $250 for electric vehicles and $100 for hybrids.

Remember: The Senate will likely make changes to the House version of the legislation, but if these EV provisions become law, they would increase the cost of ownership for those vehicles.

What about auto tariffs under Trump?

Data show that Trump’s auto tariffs introduced in 2025 are already driving up car prices across the U.S.

The 25% tariff on imported vehicles and parts has reportedly pushed the price of an average new vehicle up by 2.5% in April.

That’s more than double the typical monthly increase for this time of year, according to Cox Automotive and Kelley Blue Book analyses.

True Car reports that some foreign models have seen increases of $5,000 to $10,000. Global supply chains also affect domestically produced automobiles, some facing added costs of about $2,000 to $3,000.

Note: When it comes to the proposed car loan interest deduction, most imported vehicles, subject to the new 25% tariff, wouldn’t meet this U.S. assembly requirement and would not be eligible for it.

However, some U.S.-assembled vehicles may still include imported parts affected by tariffs. As a result, higher parts costs from tariffs could still push up prices for some qualifying models.

Buying a car: Bottom line

Even if the proposed car loan tax deduction becomes law, car buyers shouldn’t lose sight of the bigger financial picture.

The price of the car, interest rates, insurance, upkeep, and any new fees all add up quickly. It’s also important to keep tabs on your credit score, since that can make a big difference in what you pay over the life of your loan.

Recent tariffs could also play a role: a 25% tariff on most auto parts could push prices even higher, even for models assembled in the U.S. Though two court rulings issued in late May, have at least temporarily halted some of Trump's tariffs.

No matter what tax breaks could be on the table, it’s worth taking the time to run the numbers, shop around for the best financing, and make sure your car purchase truly fits your needs and budget.

https://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/ev-tax-credit-elimination-what-could-mean-tesla-us-auto-industry-ends

The reconciliation bill working its way through Congress would eliminate the electric vehicle tax credit created under the Inflation Reduction Act. The removal of the credit, created to incentivize U.S. consumers to purchase electrified vehicles, would likely lead to a drop in EV sales and production. However, Tesla sales would likely remain largely unaffected, one expert predicts.

""Getting rid of this $7,500 tax credit should not impact [Tesla] sales,"" automotive expert Lauren Fix told FOX Business. ""People buy Teslas because they like the product… They know what their customers want, and those that like Teslas will continue to purchase that product.""

The ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act"" was approved by the House on May 22 in a 215-214 vote. If the measure passes the Senate and is signed into law by President Donald Trump, the $7,500 new-vehicle tax credit and $4,000 used-vehicle tax credit incentives on EVs would be killed, along with subsidies for battery manufacturing, the text of the bill says. The EV tax credit, which started during the Obama administration, is set to expire on Dec. 31, 2032. The new provision ""accelerates the expiration to December 31, 2025.""

Ending the clean vehicle tax credit would result in a sharp decrease in EV sales in the U.S., Fix said.

""Once that tax credit goes away, I'm expecting [electric vehicles] to be about 2% of sales,"" Fix said, noting that EVs currently account for around 8% of total car sales in the U.S. ""There will still be electric vehicle sales, Tesla will still survive and [Elon Musk] will do well. And other brands will make what consumers want.""

Tesla, the leading EV manufacturer in the U.S., has focused more on selling carbon credits to other automakers than it has on consumer tax incentives. The company, which has moved the bulk of its production to Texas, has also become ""more efficient and effective"" in its manufacturing, according to Fix.

""What Tesla has done, and they don't really care about the $7,500 tax credit, is they were selling carbon credits to all the other car manufacturers,"" Fix said. ""That's where they've made their profits.""

Meanwhile, other leading EV automakers like Hyundai and Ford may decide to reduce production of electrified vehicles if the One Big Beautiful Bill Act is signed into law, she said.

""You're going to see their production quantities drop dramatically,"" Fix said. ""The only reason the manufacturers are building electric vehicles to begin with is because they were mandated to do so.""

Energy Secretary Chris Wright said Friday he canceled nearly $4 billion in project grants, in another massive blow to clean energy and greenhouse gas emissions reduction efforts in the U.S. under President Donald Trump’s administration.

The grants, largely awarded during former President Joe Biden’s final few months in the White House, were primarily for programs to capture carbon emissions and store them underground. Other targeted efforts span cleaner cement, natural gas and more.

Some of the 24 canceled awards include $500 million to Heidelberg Materials US, Inc.; $375 million to Eastman Chemical Company; $95 million to Nevada Gold Mines, LLC; and $270 million to Sutter CCUS, among others, according to a list provided by the Department of Energy. Sublime Systems, which lost an $87 million grant, was “surprised and disappointed,” the company said in a statement.

“Today’s action is bad for U.S. competitiveness in the global market and also directly contradictory to the administration’s stated goals of supporting energy production and environmental innovation,” said Conrad Schneider, a senior director at the Clean Air Task Force. It “undercuts U.S. competitiveness at a time when there is a growing global market for cleaner industrial products and technologies.”

The news was a swift follow-up to plans the Energy Department announced earlier this month to review 179 funded projects, totaling over $15 billion, that were awarded by the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations created under the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law.

It is part of Wright’s pledge to ensure “responsible” spending — aligning with the government’s broader efficiency and cost-cutting measures, such as those recommended by the Department of Government Efficiency, which has significantly impacted federal research, workers and agencies.

“While the previous administration failed to conduct a thorough financial review before signing away billions of taxpayer dollars, the Trump administration is doing our due diligence to ensure we are utilizing taxpayer dollars to strengthen our national security, bolster affordable, reliable energy sources and advance projects that generate the highest possible return on investment,” Wright said in Friday’s statement.

Moreover, the announcement marks the latest of the administration’s attacks on clean energy, broadly, and its effort to slash federal support for projects addressing climate change.

The Trump administration has taken an ax to Biden-era environmental ambitions, rolled back landmark regulations, withdrawn climate project funding, and instead bolstered support for oil and gas production in the name of an “American energy dominance” agenda.

Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, called the news “shortsighted.”

Carbon capture has been a controversial climate solution, as skeptics say it enables the continued burning of fossil fuels oil, coal and natural gas that emit planet-warming greenhouse gases — including carbon dioxide — and distracts from the need to cut ties with those energy sources altogether. Though investment in the technology has grown, it also remains challenging to scale.

Industry decries the news

Organizations quickly decried the secretary’s actions, stressing that the cancelations don’t align with the administration’s goals to bolster domestic manufacturing or energy independence.

Jessie Stolark, the executive director of the nonpartisan Carbon Capture Coalition, said the news “is a major step backward” for carbon management technologies, which are “crucial to meeting America’s growing demand for affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy.”

“These projects are not just reducing pollution, they are keeping the U.S. on the cutting edge of manufacturing technology,” said Mike Williams, senior fellow on the energy and environment team at public policy and advocacy group the Center for American Progress. “Canceling these important projects will raise energy prices for consumers and sacrifice thousands of high-quality union jobs, all because the president wants to curry favor with Big Oil.”

Evan Gillespie, partner at decarbonization organization, Industrious Labs, said the move dismantles the economy and the future of American manufacturing and its workforce.

“Killing these projects means more emissions, more pollution, and more people getting sick,” he said.

McGinness Hills Geothermal Optimization (Lander County): The project will expand three existing power plants by adding new wells, advanced heat exchangers, cooling fans, and a 15-MW solar PV field—potentially increasing output beyond the current 193-MW capacity.

Pinto Geothermal Project (near Denio): Exploration and test drilling on public lands to evaluate geothermal energy potential.

BLM To Complete Reviews in 14 Days

Under the new process, the US Bureau of Land Management (BLM) will complete environmental assessments in just 14 days—a sharp drop from the typical year or more. Full environmental impact statements, which usually take up to 2 years, will now be finalized in just 28 days.

The expedited permitting reviews apply to a broad range of traditional energy developments, including oil and natural gas, natural gas liquids, refined petroleum products, uranium, coal, biofuels, geothermal energy, kinetic hydropower, and critical minerals.

Ormat’s Journey

Ormat was established in 1965 by Lucien Y. Bronicki and his wife, Dita, according to the company’s website. Building upon Bronicki’s patents and research performed at the National Laboratory, the aim was to continue the development, manufacturing, and commercialization of a small solar turbine following the discontinuation of the project in the laboratory due to budget constraints. In 1966, Ormat’s first 600-W solar-powered Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) unit, which drove an electric water pump, was installed in Mali.

Fast forward to the 1980s when Ormat transitioned from a supplier of power equipment to a power plant turnkey provider, which expanded to owner and operator of geothermal plants, including exploration, development, and operation of geothermal fields. In 1984, the Wubaska (Nevada) 700-KW ORC geothermal power plant was the first commercial ORC in operation in the US. In 1986, the 30-MW Ormesa 1 (geothermal power plant in Holtville, California) was put in operation, according to Ormat.

In 2011, the US Department of Energy issued a $350 million partial loan guarantee under the Financial Institution Partnership Program to finance Ormat's three geothermal power plants across northern Nevada.

Last year, Ormat and SLB agreed to a strategic collaboration to develop and deliver integrated geothermal projects. SLB said in a press release that it has been involved in 80% of the world’s geothermal power projects. Combined with Ormat being the largest manufacturer of geothermal binary equipment and the largest owner and operator of geothermal fields and power plants under management, the companies see benefits to be gained by their complementary strengths.

Earlier this month, a subsidiary of Ormat Technologies signed an agreement to acquire the 20-MW Blue Mountain Geothermal Project in Nevada from Cyrq Energy LLC for $88 million. Closing is expected at the end of June, Ormat said in its Q1 2025 presentation. The plant was originally built by Ormat in 2009. Planned upgrades include 3.5 MW additional capacity by 2027 and 13 MW of solar PV for the geothermal auxiliary.",https://assets.spe.org/dims4/default/202a71d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1920x1008+0+136/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fspe-brightspot.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com%2F5f%2F30%2F1e9130cb499b80ae60676cf73b8b%2Format-geothermal-mcginness-hills-complex.jpg,N,,2025-05-31 05:01:02.269365

“I think the toothpaste is out of the proverbial tube.” EV Updates Greenfield said electric vehicle (EV) sales continue to increase.
According to BloombergNEF, global passenger EV sales are forecast to rise 30% to 22 million in 2025.
He provided data from Cox Automotive focusing on the market share of U.S. car and truck sales by vehicle type.
Repair and Service Implications In terms of repair and service implications, Greenfield noted that franchise dealers have been consistently losing market share for vehicle maintenance.","During the Equipment and Tool Institute (ETI) ToolTech conference in April, an automotive industry update was provided by Steve Greenfield, general partner at Automotive Ventures and author of “The Future of Mobility,” “The Future of Automotive Retail” and the weekly “Intel Report.”

Greenfield pointed to the current migration toward purchasing larger vehicles, pickup trucks and SUVs. As an example, the top three selling light vehicles in 2024 were the Ford F-Series (765,649), the Chevrolet Silverado (549,945) and the Toyota RAV4 (475,193).

Looking back to the mid-1970s, Greenfield noted that sedans and wagons were the dominant cars on the road. Fast forward to today, and many U.S. vehicles are similar in weight, although their miles per gallon and horsepower have doubled.

“With lightweighting technologies, we've been able to bring the weight equal to what the weight was back in 1975 and found a lot more efficiencies with drivetrains,” he explained. “That’s why we’ve had this creeping up in size and weight.”

As a result, he said automobiles have never been heavier, more powerful, less polluting or more efficient.

He also shared the reason why many prefer to have their loved ones in heavier cars.

“The fatality rate is roughly seven times higher when colliding with a heavy pickup truck than with a compact car,” he shared. “As the weight of your car increases, the risk of killing others increases dramatically.”

Greenfield forecasted the trend will continue. “It’s an interesting philosophical argument to say, ‘How do we convince the American consumer to go back to smaller and lighter-weight vehicles?” he said. “I think the toothpaste is out of the proverbial tube.”

EV Updates

Greenfield said electric vehicle (EV) sales continue to increase. According to BloombergNEF, global passenger EV sales are forecast to rise 30% to 22 million in 2025.

“However, the rate of change is coming down,” said Greenfield. “In the U.S. especially, we've topped out on battery electric vehicles (BEVs). We're hovering around 8% to 9%, even with the tax incentives, which haven't yet been repealed but are likely to get repealed at some point.”

Currently, China has the largest share of EV sales, while Western countries, including the U.S., have slowed down.

With EVs losing ground, Greenfield said hybrid sales are rising, which will have implications on repairability. He provided data from Cox Automotive focusing on the market share of U.S. car and truck sales by vehicle type. EV sales have softened and are currently at 6.2%. Non-plug-in hybrids make up 8.5% and plug-in hybrids account for 2.3%.

BloombergNEF expects slow growth in EV market share this year in the U.S., followed by an acceleration in the years to come.

Greenfield said EV growth would likely be dependent on advancements in battery technology, such as solid-state batteries and inductive (wireless) charging, which provide faster charging, improved safety and better range.

He forecasts that, ultimately, EVs will be the dominant drivetrain. However, in the interim, especially if the tax credits get repealed, he said, “We've got a world of hurt and a lot of noise between now and that vision in the future.”

In the meantime, he said, “balancing this is very, very hard for legacy automakers,” which are evaluating when to build battery plants and anticipating when consumers will be ready to purchase EVs.

He used the example of Ford’s lack of profitability in EVs.

“All this noise about consumer adoption means that Ford believes there will be a future where EVs are dominant, but in the meantime, they're eating a lot of losses with their business.”

He said it would be easy to say, “Stop building EVs. We're going to go all in on ICE.” However, that would be shortsighted if automakers believe that batteries will be the dominant drivetrain in the future.

Implications of U.S. Tariffs

Greenfield also discussed the impact of tariffs on car purchases. From the conversations he has had with dealerships, Greenfield has found they are experiencing strong sales.

“If I give you any hint today, buy a car soon because when these tariffs hit, you're going to see a massive increase in MSRP and the used car market will react almost immediately like it did during COVID,” said Greenfield.

As a result, he said consumers will face higher prices and likely slow down purchasing due to shell shock. This dynamic, according to Greenfield, will not be beneficial for inflation or consumers.

China Perspective

After two centuries of the West leading five successive technological waves — the Industrial Revolution, the Age of Steam & Rail, the Age of Steel & Electricity, the Age of Oil & Mass production and the Information Age — Greenfield said that China is poised to lead the world into the sixth major technology revolution: the Renewable Age.

Data from BloombergNEF illustrates that China dominates the battery value chain, with 95% of all battery technology. In addition, Chinese car production shares have risen from 1% to 39% over the past 20 years, according to Bloomberg/BofA Global Research.

Greenfield said China’s car production capacity has risen faster than sales due to lower production costs.

“China now comprises 40% of all vehicles built,” he said.

With approximately 150 Chinese automakers, Greenfield said the country is experiencing overproduction.

“The Chinese are pushing very aggressively to export cars elsewhere,” he explained.

However, he said the dynamics are unsustainable and forecasted there will be fewer automakers and franchise dealers, as well as less capacity, as a result.

“I think you are going to see more pressure on the legacy automakers, for lack of any other strategy, to consolidate,” Greenfield predicted.

Repair and Service Implications

In terms of repair and service implications, Greenfield noted that franchise dealers have been consistently losing market share for vehicle maintenance. In the 1960s, they had about 45% market share, according to a study by Cox Automotive Maintenance and Repair. Today, that percentage has fallen to about 30% of consumers who use franchise dealers to service their vehicles.

Greenfield attributes this to the reduced number of components in EVs. An ICE vehicle, for example, has about 2,000 moving parts, whereas an EV has 20.

“The fewer the parts, the less frequent service,” Greenfield acknowledged.

Greenfield said the rise in hybrids provides more opportunities for repair and service centers due to the vehicles’ two drivetrains.

“You're going to need the service intervals for the battery, but you're also going to need the service intervals for the ICE engine,” he noted.

With hybrids, there are more chances for components to fail, additional maintenance and potential recalls, which provide the opportunity to see consumers more frequently.

“I think franchisors should be feeling pretty confident now as opposed to a few years ago,” said Greenfield.

With vehicles becoming more complex, Greenfield acknowledged it will be challenging for technicians to keep up with the various OEM certification programs and specifications. In addition to new skill sets that will be needed, there will be specific tools and equipment required by automakers.

He forecasted a movement toward a national Right to Repair Act that would enable independent repair shops to obtain the schematics and telematics data needed.

Looking ahead, Greenfield predicted OEMs will do everything within their power to drive loyalty back to franchise dealers.

Greenfield cited data from Bloomberg, Bureau of Labor Statistics, showing the cost of vehicle repairs has increased by almost 50% since the start of the pandemic, far exceeding regular inflation.

“We had supply chain issues all of us lived through. You couldn't get parts. You couldn't get technicians to show up,” he recalled. “As a result, all of that meant very much higher cost to repair vehicles overall.”

He predicts this will continue.

Greenfield also provided a comparison of EV vs. ICE construction based on information from Mitchell.

“EVs are comprised of a higher percentage of lighter-weight materials such as aluminum, carbon fiber and composites,” he explained. “These substrates respond differently than mild steel after an accident and are much more likely to require replacement than mild steel major component parts.”

The average number of replacement parts per estimate has grown by more than 15% since 2019 in the U.S. and Canada, according to Mitchell data. Replacement parts account for more than 51% of the overall repair cost.

As a result of these changes, Greenfield said the average repair bill for a vehicle after an accident will increase severity. Higher repairability costs will also likely manifest in higher insurance premiums.

“There has to be a reconciliation at some point,” said Greenfield. “I don't really hear ever that consumers are pushing back around buying a car because of the insurance premiums in the car, but maybe that's going to be more of a topic of conversation going forward.”",https://www.autobodynews.com/images/Nov_24/Steve_Greenfield_web_full.jpg,N,,2025-05-31 07:05:06.256112

I’m proud to have worked in tandem with my colleagues and President Trump to make good on a promise I made.

On May 22, Congress struck down a key aspect of the Biden Administration’s nationwide EV mandate under the Congressional Review Act. This is a win for American consumers and protects Congress’s constitutional and statutory oversight authority over federal agencies and unelected bureaucratic overreach.

How did we get here?

More than 50 years ago, Congress allowed California to request a “waiver” from applicable federal air regulations. Congress provided California this tool because the state had extraordinarily poor air quality and unique challenges to control it. Recently, California has abused that discreet authority to set climate policy across the country.

In December of 2024, the lame duck Biden Environmental Protection Agency approved California’s request to implement its “Advanced Clean Cars II” regulation when Democrats wouldn’t have to face voters over this politically toxic policy.

California’s ACC II waiver requires all vehicles sold in the state, Washington D.C., and the 11 other states that have adopted California’s standard to be zero emissions vehicles by 2035. This means in one decade that these states, totaling 30% of the nation’s new car market, will have a full ban on the sale of gasoline powered vehicles and traditional hybrids. These unattainable standards, backed by a fine of over $26,000 per vehicle for non-compliance, would reshape auto manufacturing and take away consumer choice across the country.

Only 2.3% of new vehicle registrations in West Virginia last year were EVs. Nationwide, EVs accounted for only 10.2% of new vehicle registrations. West Virginians don’t want California’s climate policy, and West Virginians don’t want California’s EV mandate. I’m confident that most Americans don’t want these things, either.

The Biden EPA tried to avoid accountability from Congress by claiming their decision was not a rule and refusing to submit it to Congress under the CRA.

Fortunately, President Trump corrected this by identifying the waiver as a rule and submitting it to Congress.

To protect American consumers and workers, as well as the Senate’s oversight authority of bad agency rules, I introduced a resolution under the CRA to reverse EPA’s California waiver. Using this statutory process allows members of the Senate and the House — the constitutionally elected representatives of all Americans — to decide whether a nationally significant agency rule should move forward.

After the rule was submitted to Congress, Senate Democrats who wanted to protect this EV mandate requested the Government Accountability Office find the waiver was not a rule under the CRA. GAO has consistently found that once a rule is submitted by an agency, GAO does not issue an opinion. Despite its own precedent, GAO “observed” in a letter that the Biden EPA action approving California’s waiver was not a rule under the CRA, despite the agency’s submittal to Congress.

Democrats got this GAO letter to obstruct the Senate from exercising its authority provided by the CRA. Nothing in the plain text of the CRA, Senate Rules, or Senate precedents gives unelected staff at the GAO the authority to prevent the Senate from considering a resolution of disapproval against a rule that has been submitted to Congress.

Once an agency submits a rule to Congress, as EPA did here, elected representatives are able to decide whether to approve or disapprove of the rule. That is how the CRA and GAO precedent has functioned since its enactment in 1996 as a statutory exception to the Senate’s normal practice of unlimited debate. This allows Congress to realize the fundamental purpose of the CRA – oversight by elected representatives over unelected agencies.

Democrat senators claim that our action undermines the legislative filibuster. That is simply untrue. Unlike my Democrat colleagues, I have supported the legislative filibuster as a senator in the majority and as a senator in the minority. The procedural action we have taken is not about the filibuster. Instead, the procedural action the Senate has taken is simply about whether GAO staff can violate its own precedent and have veto authority over elected officials’ ability to use the CRA against rules submitted to Congress by an agency. The answer is no.

Despite the best efforts of unelected bureaucrats in California, the Biden Administration, and congressional Democrats to shield this EV mandate from the will of the American people, Congress has rejected California’s attempt to impose an electric vehicle mandate that would have eliminated consumer choice, increased prices, and killed jobs across the country.

Dive Brief:

Eight of the top 10 states for utility-scale clean energy deployment in the first quarter of 2025 voted Republican in last year’s Presidential election, the American Clean Power Association said on Thursday.

Texas was the runaway leader with more than 1,700 megawatts of wind, solar and energy storage deployments and a 20% year-over-year increase in total clean energy capacity. Florida, Indiana, Ohio and Wyoming rounded out the top five, ACP said.

The 7.4 gigawatts of new clean power capacity in the U.S. was the second-strongest Q1 on record. Energy storage was the fastest-growing segment, with nationwide battery storage capacity increasing 65% year over year.

Dive Insight:

Total utility-scale clean energy deployments in the first quarter of this year came in 9% shy of the record-setting first quarter of 2024, when developers commissioned 8,089 MW of wind, solar and storage capacity, ACP said.

ACP’s data reflects the increasingly broad geography of utility-scale solar and storage deployments. Indiana quadrupled its energy storage capacity, adding 435 MW, while Illinois, Mississippi, Wisconsin and Ohio all deployed far more solar than California. Total U.S. clean energy capacity sits at about 320.9 GW — of which, 80.7 GW is in Texas, ACP said.

The clean power development pipeline expanded as well, growing 12% year over year to reach about 184.4 GW and an estimated $328 billion in completed value. But that marks a slowdown from a year ago, when fully permitted clean power capacity under construction or in advanced development rose 26% from Q1 2023.

Developers have canceled more than $14 billion in clean energy projects so far this year amid uncertainty over the future of federal tax credits for clean energy investment, production and manufacturing, according to the consulting group E2.

ACP’s latest report hinted at the scale of the potential risk to state and local economies if the House GOP’s proposed rapid wind-down of energy tax credits remains in the final budget reconciliation bill that now sits before the Senate.

Domestic manufacturing and energy production investments now generate $3.4 billion in annual tax revenue and landowner payments in rural communities and have created nearly 650,000 jobs, ACP said.

“We have the technology, investment capital and workforce required to build the $300+ billion of clean energy projects in our development pipeline,” Grumet said, describing those projects as shovel-ready. “The greatest threat to a reliable energy system is an unreliable political system.”

Utilities and independent power producers across the South, Midwest and West have proposed dozens of gigawatts of new gas-fired generation projects since 2023, including an up to 4.5-GW project in western Pennsylvania that could begin operations next year and eventually become the United States’ largest gas power plant.

Clarios is in talks with officials from Indiana, Texas, and Utah about possible locations, the release said. The project is the first under the company’s $6 billion U.S. energy manufacturing plan, which includes $1.9 billion for critical minerals processing and recovery.

“We have a number of other investments we're actively exploring and anticipate additional announcements in the future,” Adam Muellerweiss, Clarios chief sustainability officer, said in an email to Supply Chain Dive.

The planned facility would extract metalloid antimony from used batteries collected across the U.S. to bolster domestic battery production, Muellerweiss said at the Securing American Battery Technologies Summit, held the same day as the plant announcement.

In December, China banned the export of antimony and other critical minerals used in military and civilian applications to the U.S. That action significantly raised the need for Clarios’ recycling plant, Muellerweiss said, noting that recycled batteries ""have the most antimony of any source here in the United States.”

In an email, Muellerweiss said actions taken by Presidents Donald Trump and Joe Biden have made it possible for Clarios to invest in bolstering the nation’s critical mineral supply.

Since January, Trump has issued nine executive orders that affected critical mineral processing, refining and deployment, Muellerweiss said. In 2022, Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act, which established the Advanced Manufacturing Production Tax Credit. The AMPTC is also known as the 45x tax credit.

Why are Republicans ostracizing renewable energy and biting their noses to spite their faces?","It has become obvious that the Trump administration as well as Republicans in Ohio and West Virginia no longer believe their own mantra “all of the above” when it comes to energy sources. Instead, this administration has put a halt to as many renewable energy projects as possible and is now taking us back to the good ole’ days where fossil fuels were our only choice.

West Virginia politicians and the Trump administration want to revive the coal industry while ignoring the negative environmental and health impacts, the costs, and the fact that the average age of coal plants is over 50 years. Coal states like West Virginia are getting help from Trump in the form of several executive orders. The first, Strengthening the Reliability and Security of the United States Electric Grid executive order (EO), permits the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to favor fossil energy over renewable energy and to use its emergency powers under Section 202 of the Federal Power Act to prop up old, uneconomic coal-burning power plants “even if there are cheaper alternatives that could replace them.”

The second EO, Reinvigorating America’s Beautiful Clean Coal Industry, will permit the expansion of coal leasing on federal lands and offer loans as well as expedite permitting. The third directive, Regulatory Relief for Certain Stationary Sources to Promote American Energy, will exempt coal plants from complying with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) updated Mercury and Air Toxics Standards. Research shows that local communities have had to pay $236 billion in overall added health costs between 2015 and 2023 attributed to coal mining and coal power plants.

The fourth EO, Protecting American Energy from State Overreach, “directs the U.S. Department of Justice to harass state and local governments by challenging climate, climate justice, and energy laws and policies.” Coal mining and coal power plants contribute to climate changing gases like carbon dioxide and methane. Coal extraction also creates coal-ash dumps; West Virginia has 48. They “contain hazardous pollutants including arsenic, boron, cobalt, chromium, lead, lithium, mercury, molybdenum, radium, selenium, and other heavy metals. These are linked to cancer, heart and thyroid disease, reproductive failure, and neurological harm.”

Ohio, citing the need for more energy to power AI, cryptocurrency, and other technologies, wants to expand fracked methane gas production across the state. John Quigley, a senior fellow at the University of Pennsylvania’s Kleinman Center for Energy Policy said of this methane gas buildout, “we will not get to net zero by 2050 if we are building new gas plants. Period.”

Renewable energy like wind has been touted as being clean, cheap and reliable, but the Trump administration “directed agencies to stop all permits for wind farms pending federal review.”

West Virginia is also pushing back on wind energy as Sen. Chris Rose introduced SB 439 which would repeal WV law §11-6A-5a. This law allows wind turbine projects to be taxed at a lower level because they are classified as “pollution control facilities.” Sen. Joey Garcia said of SB 439, “It’s kind of a slap and an affront to those businesses in West Virginia, including those energy businesses that want to bring new investments to the state of West Virginia.”

Ohio has some of the most stringent set-back laws in the USA for wind turbines; 1125 feet from the blade tip to boundary line. However, fracking well pads can be located within 150 feet of a property boundary. Ohio’s SB 52 “grants county commissioners the power to designate areas where wind and solar development can be restricted or prohibited.” But, private land can be taken for fracking using “mandatory pooling laws.”

“There are more than 100,000 acres of former mine lands and other brownfields in West Virginia that could be suitable for solar development.” West Virginia had plans to build solar arrays in these types of areas where extractive industries were once located. But, West Virginians still aren’t able to subscribe to community solar programs in the state, and HB 2568, introduced in February this year, will do away with net metering for public utilities. This is a process which allows citizens with solar panels to sell excess energy back to the grid.

Using SB 52, Ohio counties have stopped several solar projects which would have provided substantial benefits to the communities as well as cheap power for the grid. Recently, Open Road Renewables’ Grange Solar Grazing Center in Logan County withdrew its application for a Certificate of Environmental Compatibility and Public Need from the Ohio Power Siting Board (OPSB). It would have provided thousands of dollars in taxes to the local community along with starting a local sheep grazing industry.

Local opposition stoked by dark money groups and “anti-solar propaganda” were cited as some of the reasons the project (which was an agrivoltaics project) was abandoned. Some claim solar panels are toxic. To address these claims the Ohio Department of Health did a study in 2022 on the safety of solar energy which included: solar materials (Silicon and Tellurium), disposal and storage, heat, noise, electromagnetic fields, and battery storage. For all categories, no public health burden was found, unlike health studies performed for gas fracking by the Physicians for Social Responsibility which found multiple health issues with the process.

“According to Lazard’s 2023 analysis of unsubsidized Levelized Cost of Electricity in the U.S., both onshore wind and utility-scale solar photovoltaic (PV) technologies are more cost-effective than combined cycle natural gas power plants” and in 2024, solar and wind provided 17 percent of USA electricity, exceeding coal’s 15 percent. Why are Republicans ostracizing renewable energy and biting their noses to spite their faces?

In a new research note, the analyst highlighted a year of “divergence” and “a bifurcated global EV industry,” noting “distinct implications for OEMs, suppliers, energy players and investors.”

“While China’s EV market pushes ahead with scale and innovation, the West is slowing, facing demand headwinds, policy uncertainty, and rising costs,” the analyst said.

Regarding EV penetration in the United States, Roeska stated that, year to date, “9.9% of new car sales in the U.S. have been EVs,” up from 9.6% in the same period last year.

The analyst noted, however, that the rate of growth was slower from 2024 to 2025, when compared to the “2.9% of growth seen from 2023 to 2024.”

“However, despite a period of slower growth, we forecast EV sales growth to continue,” the analyst stated.

By 2030, the firm expects that 25% of new car sales will be battery electric vehicles (BEV), and 11% will be plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV).

In so doing, the Court reversed the D.C. Circuit Court’s ruling in Seven County Infrastructure Coalition v. Eagle County, Colorado (Seven County), finding that the Board erred in failing to consider potential upstream and downstream environmental effects of a proposed rail line in an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). The decision marks a notable shift in the scope of NEPA obligations, particularly in contrast to the D.C. Circuit’s earlier reliance on Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) regulations and Sierra Club v. FERC (Sabal Trail), which held that an agency conducting NEPA review must consider greenhouse gas emissions that may occur downstream of an authorized project if those emissions are “reasonably foreseeable” when such emissions are an indirect environmental effect of the approval.

In Seven County, a group of Utah counties applied to the Board for approval of an 88-mile railroad line to facilitate the transportation of crude oil to refineries in other states. The Board prepared an EIS and, based on the conclusion that the project’s transportation and economic benefits outweighed its environmental effects, approved the railroad line. Eagle County, Colorado, and several environmental groups challenged the EIS in the D.C. Circuit arguing that the EIS should have considered the environmental impacts from upstream oil drilling in the Uinta Basin and downstream oil refining projects in the U.S. Gulf Coast. Relying on Sabal Trail, the D.C. Circuit agreed and found that the Board had wrongfully limited its analysis of the environmental effects of the railroad line project. The Seven County Infrastructure Coalition then appealed to the Supreme Court, which granted certiorari to review the D.C. Circuit’s findings.

NEPA Is a Procedural Cross Check and Not a Substantive Roadblock to Agency Decision-Making

Justice Kavanaugh, writing for the majority, characterized NEPA a “procedural crosscheck and not a substantive roadblock.” The Court was highly critical of litigants using NEPA to delay or block infrastructure projects based on downstream environmental effects over which a permitting agency had no legal authority. It stated that as long as an EIS addresses environmental effects of the project at hand, courts should defer to the lead agency’s decision regarding the scope of review. This includes in the extent to consider its indirect environmental impacts, and whether to analyze environmental effects from other projects that were separate in time or place, or subject to a different regulatory scheme. It repeatedly emphasized its holding in Department of Transportation v. Public Citizen, a 2004 decision finding that an agency’s NEPA analysis need not consider effects for which it is not the proximate cause. In other words, simply because “the effects from a separate project may be factually foreseeable,” this “does not mean that those effects are relevant to the agency’s decision-making process or that it is reasonable to hold the agency responsible for those effects.”

The Court espoused a “rule of reason,” noting that courts should not substitute their judgement for that of the agency. Finally, the Court found that the D.C. Circuit erroneously had required the Board to consider environmental impacts of projects that were separate in time and place from the rail project that the counties were proposing to construct, were outside the Board’s jurisdiction and if they were to move forward in the future would be undertaken by third parties.

In a separate opinion concurring in the judgment, Justice Sotomayor (joined by Justices Kagan and Jackson) agreed that the D.C. Circuit had required too much of the Board under NEPA. But they reached that conclusion simply because the Board indisputably lacked authority to deny approval of the railroad line based on the environmental concerns at issue.

Potential Impacts of Decision

Seven County is the latest action to restrict project opponents’ use of the NEPA process to defeat infrastructure projects. Indeed, the opinion observes that NEPA challenges not only prevent projects from crossing the “finish line,” but discourages some from approaching the “starting line.” The Court’s interpretation of NEPA, and its differentiation between effects that are factually foreseeable versus legally relevant, is at odds with the NEPA regulations implemented last year under President Biden, which had emphasized consideration of downstream impacts from greenhouse gas emissions, as explained by Akin in an earlier alert. While CEQ used an interim final rule to remove those regulations in February of this year, the Seven County decision is likely to blunt future challenges to the NEPA regulatory scheme, as we anticipate changes will be made in response to forthcoming CEQ guidance and congressional NEPA reform efforts. The decision also follows a November 2024 D.C. Circuit decision, Marin Audubon Society v. Federal Aviation Administration (Marin Audubon), that held CEQ lacked statutory authority to issue any regulations, further weakening the NEPA regulatory scheme.

The Court’s focus on agency deference and clarification that agencies are not required to consider upstream and downstream impacts of a project may further expedite NEPA reviews and streamline permitting by lessening the types of legal challenges to agency decision-making. The Court also emphasized the importance of clarity and predictability in cases involving the American economy, which may signal a shift to jurisprudence that champions economic opportunities over environmental considerations. It remains to be seen how this may impact ongoing debates in Congress on permitting reform and changes to the NEPA statute, including how it may affect discussions underway regarding a potential provision that would allow project sponsors to pay for expedited NEPA review in favor of agency deference.",https://www.akingump.com/a/web/6TJqJKWbi7h1tpz46Eani/aqjviA/mind-over-matter-executive-order-seeks-to-reframe-regulatory-crime.jpg,N,,2025-05-31 02:01:00.447215

Associated Press

More than $14 billion in clean energy investments in the U.S. have been canceled or delayed this year, according to an analysis released Thursday, as President Donald Trump‘s pending megabill has raised fears over the future of domestic battery, electric vehicle and solar and wind energy development.

Many companies are concerned that investments will be in jeopardy amid House Republicans’ passage of a tax bill that would gut clean energy credits, nonpartisan group E2 said in its analysis of projects that it and consultancy Atlas Public Policy tracked.

The groups estimate the losses since January have also cost 10,000 new clean energy jobs.

The tax credits, bolstered in the landmark climate bill passed under former President Joe Biden in 2022, are crucial for boosting renewable technologies key to the clean energy transition. E2 estimates that $132 billion in plans have been announced since the so-called Inflation Reduction Act passed, not counting the cancellations.

Last week’s House bill effectively renders moot many of the law’s incentives. Advocacy groups decried the potential impact that could have on the industry after the multitrillion-dollar tax breaks package passed.

“The House’s plan coupled with the administration’s focus on stomping out clean energy and returning us to a country powered by coal and gas guzzlers is causing businesses to cancel plans, delay their plans and take their money and jobs to other countries instead,” E2 executive director Bob Keefe said.

The Senate is now reviewing the bill with an informal July 4 deadline to get it to the president’s desk.

What has been canceled

Some of the most recent cancellations include the Kore Power battery factory in Arizona and BorgWarner’s closure of two EV manufacturing sites in Michigan. Bosch suspended a $200 million investment in a hydrogen fuel cell factory in South Carolina, citing changes within the market over the past year in a statement to The Associated Press.

Tariffs, inflationary pressures, nascent company struggles and low adoption rates for some technologies may also have been reasons for these companies’ plans changing. For instance, the battery storage and electric vehicle sectors have seen the most impact in 2025, with the latter especially having had had a difficult past few years. Several projects spurred by the IRA were also canceled prior to 2025.

Of the projects canceled this year, most — more than $12 billion worth — came in Republican-led states and congressional districts, the analysis said. Red districts have benefited more than blue ones from an influx of clean energy development and jobs, experts say.

Georgia and Tennessee are particularly at risk because they are highly invested in EV and battery production, said Marilyn Brown, an energy policy professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology who was not involved in the analysis.

“If all of a sudden these tax credits are removed, I’m not sure how these ongoing projects are going to continue,” said Fengqi You, an engineering professor at Cornell University who also was not involved.

A handful of Republican lawmakers have urged the continuation of energy tax credits, with some saying in an April letter to Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D. that a repeal could disrupt the American people and weaken the county’s position as a global energy leader.

The US and the global stage

The Trump administration has sought to dismantle much of Biden’s environmental and climate-related policy — what he calls the Democrats’ “green new scam” — withdrawing again from the Paris climate agreement, rolling back countless landmark pollution regulations and environmental initiatives, reconsidering scientific findings supporting climate action, blocking renewable energy sources and more in an effort to bolster a fossil fuel-led “American energy dominance” agenda.

Meanwhile other countries are proceeding with green investments. The European Parliament is committing to the European Union Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, a policy meant to prevent “carbon leakage,” or companies moving production to countries where climate policies are less strict. And the International Maritime Organization is moving toward a global carbon tax on shipping.

In a sign that not all hope is lost for the future of renewables in the U.S., April alone saw nearly $500 million in new development, with Japanese manufacturing company Hitachi’s energy arm building out transformer manufacturing in Virginia and materials and technology company Corning investing in solar manufacturing in Michigan.

Still, $4.5 billion in development was canceled or delayed last month, according to E2’s tally.

Despite that ban, the Italian Ministry of the Environment and Energy Security (MASE) launched a new agriPV tender to boost project development in April this year.
Additionally, MASE issued the “suitable areas” decree in June 2024, outlining guidelines for identifying land appropriate for ground-mounted renewable energy installations.
In its ruling, the Regional Administrative Court in Lazio also questioned the constitutionality of the DL Agricoltura, which banned ground-mounted solar PV installations on agricultural land.
Furthermore, Italy saw a 16% year-on-year drop in new solar PV installations in Q1 2025, adding 1.4GW, according to trade association Italia Solare.","Covering an area of about 100 hectares, the project combines power generation and agriculture. Crops will include olives trees, aromatic herbs and cultivars like garlic, celery, parsley, several types of salad, spinach and legumins.

“This is our first project to have reached the construction phase in Italy,” said Alberto Arcioli, head of development at Aquila Clean Energy Italy.

This news comes against the backdrop of the Italian government introducing a nationwide ban on ground-mounted solar PV installations on agricultural land last year. In May 2024, the government announced the ban in a bid to protect farmland and curb what officials described as unchecked solar development.

Despite that ban, the Italian Ministry of the Environment and Energy Security (MASE) launched a new agriPV tender to boost project development in April this year. Managed by the national energy agency Gestore dei Servizi Energetici (GSE), the tender would distribute €323 million (US$349 million) to support agriPV initiatives.

Additionally, MASE issued the “suitable areas” decree in June 2024, outlining guidelines for identifying land appropriate for ground-mounted renewable energy installations. The decree granted regional authorities the power to establish their own regulations, however, the decree was partially annulled by an Italian court earlier this month. In its ruling, the Regional Administrative Court in Lazio also questioned the constitutionality of the DL Agricoltura, which banned ground-mounted solar PV installations on agricultural land.

Furthermore, Italy saw a 16% year-on-year drop in new solar PV installations in Q1 2025, adding 1.4GW, according to trade association Italia Solare. Utility-scale projects contributed nearly half of this with 684MW – up from 553MW in Q1 2024 – indicating a rise in average project size.

The country’s total installed solar capacity stands at 38.5GW at the end of March 2025, with the commercial and industrial segment leading at 17.5GW (45%), followed by residential at 10.7GW (28%) and utility-scale at 10.3GW (27%).",https://www.pv-tech.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Planta-Solar-FV-Aquila-Clean-Energy-Jaen-scaled-1.jpg,N,,2025-05-31 12:20:16.949100

Wind and solar capacity in California increased from 9.7 GW in 2014 to 28.2 GW by the end of 2024, EIA said. California curtails solar and wind generation to keep the grid stable and to leave room for natural gas generation, in order to comply with North American Electric Reliability Corp. requirements and “have generation online in time to ramp up in the evening hours,” according to the report.

CAISO is responding to increased curtailments by “trading with neighboring balancing authorities to try to sell excess solar and wind power, incorporating battery storage into ancillary services, energy, and capacity markets, and including curtailment reduction in transmission planning,” according to EIA.

Later this year, companies in the state are also planning to start using excess renewable energy to “make hydrogen, some of which will be stored and mixed with natural gas for summer generation at the Intermountain Power Project’s new facility scheduled to come online in July,” the report said.

One of those companies, SoHyCal, said that once it begins using solar energy for this purpose, it “[expects] to produce a total of three tons per day of green hydrogen powered by PV by Q2 of 2025. This amount of hydrogen will fuel up to 210,000 cars per year or 30,000 city buses.”

In Georgetown, Kentucky—Toyota’s biggest plant globally—the upcoming electric vehicle will join an existing lineup that includes the hybrid-only Camry, the RAV4 (soon dropping its gas-only version), and the Lexus ES.

In Princeton, Indiana, Toyota will produce another all-electric model alongside larger vehicles like the Sienna, Highlander, and Grand Highlander. The company hasn’t yet disclosed what that new EV will be.

How many electric vehicles will Toyota offer by 2027?

The backstory:

Toyota currently sells two all-electric models in the U.S.: the bZ4X, which will be renamed simply ""bZ,"" and the Lexus RZ. By mid-2027, five more will join the lineup:

Two new EVs built in the U.S.

Three imported EVs: the bZ Woodland, a new all-electric CH-R crossover, and an EV version of the Lexus ES.

That expansion reflects a growing, though still measured, embrace of full electrification. In 2024, EVs made up just 8% of U.S. auto sales, and Toyota sold fewer than 30,000 fully electric vehicles domestically.

How is Toyota powering this EV push?

A key driver of the strategy is Toyota’s new battery plant in Liberty, North Carolina. The massive facility spans 1,850 acres and will begin shipping lithium-ion cells later this year.

Ten of its 14 production lines will serve electric vehicles, with the rest focused on hybrids. At full capacity, it will support 30 gigawatt-hours of annual output—enough for:

300,000 fully electric vehicles

150,000 plug-in hybrids

800,000 traditional hybrid vehicles

The first hybrid battery line is set to go online next month, with the rest rolling out through 2034.

Why is Toyota still hesitant about EV demand?

The other side:

Despite its expanded EV roadmap, Toyota remains cautious. Executives are wary of weak U.S. demand, especially compared to markets like China and Europe. To safeguard production targets, Toyota will rely heavily on exports—only committing to full-scale production once a vehicle is expected to move 100,000 to 150,000 units annually.

However, that plan could face new headwinds. President Trump’s proposed tariffs could trigger trade tensions and disrupt Toyota’s global export strategies, which are key to absorbing any U.S. oversupply.

What they're saying:

Toyota officials have repeatedly emphasized their preference for letting the market—not mandates—dictate EV adoption. While some automakers are going all-in on battery electric vehicles, Toyota continues to highlight the role of hybrids and the need for flexible, diversified strategies.

Executives have argued that hybrids remain a more affordable and scalable solution for many consumers, especially amid high EV sticker prices and limited charging infrastructure in parts of the U.S.

Why you should care:

Toyota’s pivot could reshape the American EV landscape. As one of the world’s most influential automakers, its decisions carry weight.

To date, E2 has tracked 390 major clean energy projects across 42 states and Puerto Rico since the Inflation Reduction Act passed in August 2022.","More than $14 billion in US renewable and EV investments and 10,000 new jobs have been scrapped or put on hold since January, according to a new analysis from E2 and the Clean Economy Tracker. The reason: growing fears that the Republican-majority Congress will pull the plug on federal clean energy tax credits.

In April alone, companies backed out of $4.5 billion in battery, EV, and wind projects right before the House passed a sweeping tax and spending bill that would gut the federal tax incentives fueling the clean energy boom. E2 also found another $1.5 billion in previously unreported project cancellations from earlier in the year.

Now, with the Senate preparing to take up the so-called “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” E2 says over 10,000 clean energy jobs have already vanished.

“If the tax plan passed by the House last week becomes law, expect to see construction and investments stopping in states across the country as more projects and jobs are cancelled,” said Michael Timberlake, E2’s communications director. “Businesses are now counting on Congress to come to its senses and stop this costly attack on an industry that is essential to meeting America’s growing energy demand and that’s driving unprecedented economic growth in every part of the country.”

Ironically, it’s Republican-led congressional districts – the biggest beneficiaries of the Biden administration’s clean energy tax credits passed in 2022 – that are feeling the most pain. So far, more than $12 billion in investments and over 13,000 jobs have been canceled in GOP districts.

Through April, 61% of all clean energy projects, 72% of jobs, and 82% of investments have been in Republican districts.

Despite the rising number of cancellations, some companies are still forging ahead. In April, businesses announced nearly $500 million in new clean energy investments across six states. That includes a $400 million expansion by Corning in Michigan to make solar wafers, which is expected to create at least 400 jobs, and a $9.3 million investment from a Canadian solar equipment company in North Carolina.

If completed, the seven projects announced last month could create nearly 3,000 permanent jobs.

To date, E2 has tracked 390 major clean energy projects across 42 states and Puerto Rico since the Inflation Reduction Act passed in August 2022. In total, companies plan to invest $132 billion and hire 123,000 permanent workers.

But the report warns that momentum could grind to a halt if the House tax plan becomes law. Since the clean energy tax credits were signed into law, 45 announced projects have been canceled, downsized, or closed entirely, wiping out nearly 20,000 jobs and $16.7 billion in investments.

What’s more, Trump’s Department of Energy announced today that it was killing more than $3.7 billion in funding for carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) and decarbonization initiatives. Eighteen out of 24 projects were awarded through DOE’s Industrial Demonstrations Program (IDP), which was made law in the Inflation Reduction Act. It aimed to strengthen the economic competitiveness of US manufacturers in global markets demanding lower carbon emissions, while supporting US manufacturing jobs and communities.

Executive Director Jason Walsh of the BlueGreen Alliance said in a statement in response to today’s DOE announcement:

The awarded projects that DOE is seeking to kill are concentrated in rural areas and red states. American manufacturers are hungry to partner with the federal government to bolster US industry. The IDP saw $60 billion worth of applications during the program selection process, a ten-times oversubscription.

President Trump claims to be a champion of American manufacturing, but today’s announcement is further evidence that he and his Secretary of Energy are liars.

“Public participation is an important part of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) process to ensure a thorough environmental analysis, and an effective, consistent and well-informed decision,” Detroit District Commander Lt. Col. Wallace Bandeff said.

All submitted comments are included in the Detroit District’s administrative record, analyzed, and considered in the preparation of the Final EIS and other parts of the District’s review, as applicable.

“Even when operating under emergency procedures, the Detroit District remains committed to following the NEPA process,” said Lt. Col. Wallace Bandeff.

The Line 5 Tunnel Project is a proposal by Enbridge Energy, Limited Partnership (Enbridge) to construct a tunnel beneath the Straits of Mackinac in Lake Michigan. The tunnel would house a replacement segment of Enbridge’s Line 5 pipeline, which transports crude oil and natural gas liquids. The Detroit District is reviewing Enbridge’s permit application (File LRE-2010-00463-56-A19) pursuant to Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 and Section 404 of the Clean Water Act for a Department of the Army permit.

The EIS assesses the potential impacts of the Line 5 Tunnel Project and project alternatives (including the No Action alternative, an alternative that would install a protective gravel/rock cover over the existing Dual Pipelines in the Straits, and multiple pipeline decommissioning sub-alternatives, if the proposed tunnel were to be permitted) to land use and recreation; aesthetics; water resources; biological resources; cultural resources; geology; soils; transportation and navigation; air quality; noise and vibration; socioeconomics; and reliability and safety.

In addition to its consideration of cultural resources in the EIS, the Corps of Engineers is separately evaluating impacts to historic properties, as well as impact avoidance, minimization, and mitigation measures, in accordance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act

The Corps of Engineers is also conducting a treaty rights analysis in consultation with federally recognized Tribes to determine if the proposed Line 5 Tunnel Project would impinge upon or abrogate treaty rights. Findings of the Section 106 process and treaty rights analysis will be presented in the Record of Decision following release of the Final EIS.

The Record of Decision date is anticipated in fall 2025.

“The Detroit District continues to prepare the Final EIS and comply with all applicable legal and policy requirements, including its federal trust responsibility to Tribal Nations, the National Historic Preservation Act, the Endangered Species Act, and the National Environmental Policy Act,” Lt. Col. Bandeff said. “These processes will inform the District’s permit decision.”

And in 2025, Ohio took bold steps to lead the way — proving that bottom-up reform and principled policy can challenge monopolies, drive innovation, and lower energy costs for families and businesses.

For years, Ohio energy consumers have borne the brunt of outdated and crony-driven utility practices. Coal subsidies cost ratepayers millions while permitting delays and monopoly protections stifle innovation and lock in higher consumer costs.

But with the passage of a groundbreaking energy reform bill, Ohio is showing how bold policy and grassroots action can reshape energy markets, lower costs, and restore power to the people — not monopolies.

And Americans for Prosperity helped drive this achievement — rallying support from the grassroots to key policymakers and proving the power of AFP’s bottom-up approach to policy reform.

A market-based energy overhaul

Ohio passed transformational energy legislation to promote energy independence, affordability, and innovation. It represents a fundamental shift in Ohio’s energy landscape by:

Ending daily coal subsidies to the Ohio Valley Electric Corporation, saving ratepayers $450,000 per day

Eliminating electric security plans, which allowed utilities to lock in above-market rates — ensuring prices are now fairer and more competitive

Requiring market-based pricing for electricity, where rates are set by supply and demand instead of guaranteed utility profits — ending unfair advantages for monopolies

Accelerating permitting timelines to 45 days or fewer, cutting red tape and making Ohio one of the fastest in the nation for energy project approvals

Freeing the generation market, allowing more competition in how electricity is produced — unleashing innovation and affordability

These changes ensure that Ohio is an efficient, competitive, and consumer-driven energy market.

How energy reform happened

In 2024, AFP-Ohio launched a full-scale movement of its community-based grassroots army that mobilized:

Grassroots and digital: Activists knocked on thousands of doors and hosted dozens of grassroots events — including Lobby Day at the Capitol and community events at local gas stations.

Direct engagement with lawmakers: AFP demonstrated powerful lobbying efforts, including public testimony during recent committee hearings.

Empowered coalitions: AFP-Ohio locked arms with aligned organizations like The Buckeye Institute and the Ohio Manufacturers’ Association to form Ohio’s first pro-market energy coalition. Their shared voice shifted the conversation.

Emboldened policy champions: 22 AFP-backed state legislators — including reform leaders like Rep. Mike Dovilla — helped make the policy vision a reality.

At the heart of it all, when utility lobbyists pushed back, Ohioans pushed harder — and won.

A new energy era for Ohio — and beyond

Ohio’s energy overhaul is a model for the rest of the country. It proves what’s possible when policy champions follow a principled approach, with powerful grassroots advocates leading the way.

And thanks to your support, AFP-Ohio is backing the REINS Act, which would give elected lawmakers final approval over costly regulations — restoring accountability and transparency to the rulemaking process.

This initiative is gaining ground across the country, with victories already in Kentucky, Utah, and Wyoming.

AFP will continue to build on this momentum — in Ohio and across the country — to ensure every American has the tools to achieve their version of the American Dream.

The Antelope Valley BESS is LRE’s seventh low-carbon or carbon-free energy project in California and brings total installed capacity to 595 MW statewide. LRE announced the start of operations on its 352-MWh Chaparral Springs Bess in California earlier this month.

The 126-MW/504-MWh Antelope Valley BESS is powered by Powin Energy’s lithium iron phosphate batteries.

The battery storage will provide grid services to California’s electricity delivery system by storing energy during low demand and discharging during peak demand.

“Bringing the Antelope Valley BESS facility online is a major milestone for LRE and reflects our commitment to accelerating energy innovation in California,” said Sam Mangrum, EVP Project Execution at LRE, in a statement. “As our first stand-alone battery project, it expands our capabilities to deliver dispatchable power when and where it is needed most. We are proud to support the broader energy market as California transitions to a cleaner, more resilient grid that can meet growing demand.”

Earlier this year, LRE announced more than 700 MW of renewable energy projects in Oklahoma which will be supported by long-term power purchase agreements with Google. Construction has begun on the 372-MWac Mayes County Solar Portfolio, located just within one mile from Google’s data center in Pryor, Oklahoma. Together with the Twelvemile Solar Project 1 & 2 (152.5 MWac) and the Twelvemile 3 Solar Project (200 MWac), located in southern Oklahoma, these projects total 724 MW (alternate current) solar capacity in Oklahoma.

LRE purchased the Mayes County Solar Portfolio earlier this year from Red River Renewable Energy, LLC (“Red River”), a joint venture between SunChase Power, LLC and Eolian, L.P.

The U.S. Energy Information Administration predicted that solar and battery storage will lead all new power generation additions, even natural gas-fired plants, in 2025. The EIA estimated that more than 18 GW of utility-scale battery systems would be built in the U.S. this year, about 30% more than the record 14+GW achieved in 2024.

Most prominent climate tech venture capital firms — including Lowercarbon Capital, Breakthrough Energy Ventures, Prelude Ventures, and Khosla Ventures — have at least one DAC company in their portfolios.
“By comparison, nature based restorations have enormous apertures,” Chi told me.
You’ll see them funding nature-based and engineered carbon removal companies alike in an effort to take a “portfolio approach” to carbon removal.
It will become “carbon negative,” it hopes, by purchasing carbon removal.","He’s obviously not the first to realize this. DAC companies and their scientists are well aware of the challenges they face. But investors are generally comfortable taking on risk across a host of different technologies and industries on the premise that at least a few of their portfolio companies will hit it big. As such, a nascent market and challenging physics are not inherent reasons to steer clear. DAC’s potential to secure cash-rich oil and gas industry buyers is pure upside.

Most prominent climate tech venture capital firms — including Lowercarbon Capital, Breakthrough Energy Ventures, Prelude Ventures, and Khosla Ventures — have at least one DAC company in their portfolios. At One Ventures itself has backed everything from producing oxygen on the moon (while also decarbonizing steel) to indoor solar cells and thorium-powered nuclear reactors, a hobbyhorse of techno-optimist nuclear bros and former presidential candidate Andrew Yang. So the fact that Chi won’t touch DAC is no small deal.

His hesitation stems from a matter of scale.To capture that 0.04% of atmospheric carbon, many DAC companies use giant fans to pull in large volumes of air from the atmosphere, which then pass through either a solid filter or a liquid solution that chemically captures the carbon dioxide. Although some companies are pursuing alternate approaches that rely on passive air contact rather than energy-intensive fans, either way, the amount of air that reaches any DAC machine’s so-called “collection aperture” is minuscule “relative to the scale of planet Earth,” Chi told me.

He views this as the core pitfall of the technology. “Half of the [operating expense] of the system is just trying to go after a technical disadvantage that you took on from day one,” Chi said. “By comparison, nature based restorations have enormous apertures,” Chi told me. “Think about the aperture of all the forests on the planet. Think about the aperture of all the soils on the planet, all the wetlands on the planet, the ocean.” His preferred methods of carbon removal are all nature-based. “In addition, their sequestration tends to be photosynthesis-powered, which means we’re not burning natural gas or using grid electricity in order to go make that thing work.”

Nature-based solutions often raise eyebrows in the carbon removal and reduction space, though, bringing to mind highly questionable carbon offsets such as those earned via “avoided deforestation.” The inherent counterfactual — would these trees really have been cut down if we didn’t buy these credits? — is difficult to measure with any certainty, and a 2023 investigation by The Guardian found that the majority of these types of credits are essentially bogus.

This same essential question around measurability plagues everything from afforestation and reforestation to soil carbon sequestration, biochar application, and wetland restoration. It’s extremely difficult to measure how much carbon is stored — and for how long — within complex, open ecosystems. On the other hand, engineered solutions such as direct air capture or bioenergy with carbon capture and storage are simple to quantify and promise permanent storage, making them attractive to large corporate buyers and easy to incentivize via mechanisms such as the federal carbon sequestration tax credit.

When I put all this to Chi, his response was simple. “It’s not an advantage to be able to measure something that can’t solve the problem,” he told me. For a moment, it seemed as if we had hit an intellectual dead end. For now, carbon removals and reductions are mainly driven by the voluntary carbon market, where prices are based on the exact tonnage of carbon removed. Reputable buyers don’t want to be burned again by investing in difficult to quantify offsets, and the current administration certainly doesn’t seem likely to step in with nature-based removal mandates or purchasing commitments anytime soon.

Chi’s answer to this conundrum is “financial enclosure,” essentially a fancy way of saying we need to monetize the value of nature-based systems. In many cases, he admitted, we don’t quite yet know how to do that, at least in a way that benefits the common good. “We figured out how to financially enclose a forest, clear cut it in order to go make board feed and paper and pulp,” he explained. But we don’t know how to financially enclose the benefit of preserving said forest, nor many other ecosystems such as wetlands that serve as highly effective carbon sinks.

At One Ventures has backed companies that work with a variety of buyers — from national governments to mining companies and farmers — that have a financial stake in (or are legally required to care about) ecosystem preservation and restoration. “Sometimes people break nature hard enough that it becomes that obvious. And then they have to go fix it,” Chi told me. “We’re going to invest in the companies that make it possible to go do that at incredibly low cost structures.”

One portfolio company, Dendra Systems, uses robots, drones, and other automated methods to do large scale ecosystem restoration, such as replanting mangroves in parts of the world such as Myanmar and Abu Dhabi where they’ve been cleared for property development or industrial use. The governments of both countries are paying Dendra to do this after realizing that removing mangroves had catastrophic consequences —- destroying subsistence fishing, wrecking erosion breaks — that would cost more to ameliorate than simply replanting the trees.

Then there’s Dalan Animal Health, which is developing vaccines for honeybees as hives become more vulnerable to disease. While not directly focused on carbon removal, the company has successfully “financially enclosed” pollination, as industrial farmers whose crops depend on pollinators will pay for the vaccine. This helps restore healthy ecosystems that can ultimately draw down more carbon. Chi told me that insurance companies have also shown a willingness to pay for nature-based solutions that can help lessen the impact of disasters such as floods or hurricanes.

While the carbon benefits of these companies are simply a bonus, the firm has invested in one pure play removal company, Gigablue. This startup releases engineered particles into the ocean that attract carbon-absorbing phytoplankton. As the particles accumulate more plankton, they sink to the ocean floor, where the carbon is then stored. Using onsite sampling and other advanced techniques, Chi told me that this tech is “very measurable” while also having an “aperture [that] is as wide as the ocean area that we’ve sprinkled things onto.”

Though Chi dislikes the illogical nature of the voluntary carbon market — he would much prefer a “polluter pays” system where money is directed towards nature-based sequestration — he knows that with the markets we have, precise measurability is paramount. So At One Ventures is throwing money at this, too. Portfolio company Chloris Geospatial combines satellite data and machine learning to measure biomass from space and track changes over time, helping legitimize forest-based removals. And Miraterra is focused on novel sensing tech and advanced modeling that allows farmers to calculate the amount of carbon in their soil.

But even if the carbon stored in natural ecosystems never becomes quite as measurable as engineered carbon removals, Chi thinks investors, companies, or governments should still be going all in. “When your volume is so much larger, then you can even throw big error bars around your measurability and still be miles ahead,” he told me.

Many investors say they want it all. You’ll see them funding nature-based and engineered carbon removal companies alike in an effort to take a “portfolio approach” to carbon removal. Chi, unsurprisingly, thinks that’s hogwash. “It’s weasel words to be like, it’s an important part of this portfolio,” he told me. The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change also advocates for a diversified approach, without saying DAC itself is strictly necessary. DAC is “not going to do 1%, and it’s going to be massively more expensive than your other 99%,” Chi said. “At some point you’re going to be like, why is this in the portfolio?”

It’s certainly a more blunt assessment of the industry’s viability (or lack thereof) than I’ve heard any investor hazard before. But there may be more folks starting to come around to Chi’s perspective. With government support for DAC in question and the utility of carbon capture tax credits — which only benefit engineered removals — deeply threatened, venture funding for DAC is down over 60% from this time last year, Bloomberg reported.

Rajesh Swaminathan, a climate tech investor at Khosla Ventures told the publication that while many investors have taken bets on direct air capture, “Now, people are stepping back and saying, ‘Why didn’t I look at the economics there?’” Khosla itself is an investor in the DAC company Spiritus.

So what’s a longterm skeptic like Chi to do in this moment of doubt? As he told me, “I’m just going to keep on giving talks on it, and I know that physics is on my side.”

The case concerned a proposed 88-mile train line in Utah that would connect its Uinta Basin (and its oil resources) with the national rail network. Environmental groups and local governments claimed that the environmental impact statement submitted by the federal Surface Transportation Board did not pay enough attention to the effects of increased oil drilling and refining that the rail line could induce. The D.C. Circuit agreed, vacating the EIS; the Supreme Court did not, overturning the D.C. Circuit in an 8-0 decision.

The National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA, requires the federal government to study the environmental impact of its actions. The D.C. Circuit “failed to afford the Board the substantial judicial deference required in NEPA cases and incorrectly interpreted NEPA to require the Board to consider the environmental effects of upstream and downstream projects that are separate in time or place,” Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote for the court.

The court’s decision could sharply limit the ability of the judicial branch to question environmental reviews by agencies under NEPA, and could pave the way for more certain and faster approvals for infrastructure projects.

At least, that’s what Kavanaugh hopes. The current NEPA process, he writes, foists “delay upon delay” on developers and agencies, so “fewer projects make it to the finish line. Indeed, fewer projects make it to the starting line.”

2. Trump targets solar on farmland

The Department of Agriculture is planning to retool a popular financing program, Rural Energy for America, to discourage solar development on agricultural land, Heatmap’s Jael Holzman exclusively reported.

“Farmland should be for agricultural production, not solar production,” a USDA spokesperson told Heatmap. The comments echoed a USDA report released last week criticizing the use of solar on agricultural land. The report said that the USDA will “disincentivize the use of federal funding at USDA for solar panels to be installed on productive farmland through prioritization points and regulatory action.” The USDA will also “call on state and local governments to work alongside USDA on local solutions.”

3. Oil companies sued over heat death

The daughter of a woman who died during the Pacific Northwest “Heat Dome” in 2021 sued seven oil and companies for wrongful death in Washington state court, The New York Times reported Thursday.

“The suit alleges that they failed to warn the public of the dangers of the planet-warming emissions produced by their products and that they funded decades-long campaigns to obscure the scientific consensus on global warming,” according to Times reporter David Gelles.

Several cities and states have brought suits making similar claims that oil and gas companies misled the public about the threat of climate change. Earlier this week, a German court threw out a suit from a Peruvian farmer against a German utility, which claimed that the utility’s commissions helped put his town at risk from glacial flooding.

The seven companies named in the lawsuit are Exxon Mobil, Chevron, Shell, BP, ConocoPhillips, Phillips 66, and Olympic Pipeline Company, a subsidiary managed by BP. None of them commented on the suit.

4. Microsoft emits more

Tech giant Microsoft disclosed in its annual sustainability report that its carbon emissions have grown by 23.4% since 2020, even as the company has a goal to become “carbon negative” by 2030. The upside to the figures is that the growth in emissions was due to a much larger increase in energy use and business activity, not from using dirtier energy. In that same time period, Microsoft’s revenue has grown 71%, and its energy use has grown 168%.

“It has become clear that our journey towards being carbon negative is a marathon,” the report read. The company said it had contracted 34 gigawatts of non-emitting power generation and had agreements to procure 30 million metric tons of carbon removal.

The company has set out to reduce its indirect Scope 3 emissions “by more than half” by 2030 from the 11.5 million metric tons it reported in 2020, as its Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions fall to close to zero. It will become “carbon negative,” it hopes, by purchasing carbon removal.

Microsoft attempts to reduce emissions in its supply chain by procuring low- or no-carbon fuels and construction materials. Last week the tech giant signed a purchasing agreement with Sublime Systems for 600,000 tons of low-carbon cement.

5. Second SMR design approved

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission announced it had approved a 77-megawatt small modular reactor design. This is the second SMR design approved by the NRC, following approval of a smaller design in 2020. Both are products of the SMR company NuScale, and neither has yet been deployed. A project to build the earlier design in Idaho was abandoned in 2023.

The NRC review was set to be completed in July of this year. Coming in ahead of scheduled demonstrates “the agency’s commitment to safely and efficiently enable new, advanced reactor technology,” the Commission said in a press release.

Congress and the Biden and Trump administrations have pushed the NRC to move faster and to encourage the development of small modular reactors. No SMR has been built in the United States, nor is there any current plan to do so that has been publicly disclosed. NuScale’s chief executive told Bloomberg that he hopes to have a deal signed by the end of the year and an operational plant by the end of the decade.

THE KICKER

Tesla veteran Drew Baglino’s Heron Power raised a $38 million round of Series A funding for a new product designed to replace “legacy transformers and power converters by directly connecting rapidly growing megawatt-scale solar, batteries, and AI data centers to medium voltage transmission,” Baglino wrote on X.

How much do we know about developers’ reactions to the anti-IRA bill that was passed out of the House last week?

So it’s only been a few days. What I can tell you is there’s a lot of surprise about what came out of the House. Industries mobilized in trying to improve the bill from here and I think a lot of the industry is hopeful because, for many reasons, the bill doesn’t seem to make sense for the country. Not just the renewable energy industry. There’s hope that the voices in Congress — House members and senators — who already understand the impact of this on the economy will in the coming weeks understand how bad this is.

I spoke to a tax attorney last week that her clients had been preparing for a worst case scenario like this and preparing contingency plans of some kind. Have you seen anything so far to indicate people have been preparing for a worst case scenario?

Yeah. There’s a subset of the market that has prepared and already executed plans.

In Q4 [of 2024] and Q1 [of this year] with a number of companies to procure material from projects in order to safe harbor those projects. What that means is, typically if you commence construction by a certain date, the date on which you commence construction is the date you lock in tax credit eligibility, and we worked with companies to help them meet that criteria. It hedged them on a number of fronts. I don’t think most of them thought we’d get what came out of the House but there were a lot of concerns about stepdowns for the credit.

After Trump was elected, there were also companies who wanted to hedge against tariffs so they bought equipment ahead of that, too. We were helping companies do deals the night before Liberation Day. There was a lot of activity.

We saw less after April 2nd because the trade landscape has been changing so quickly that it’s been hard for people to act but now we’re seeing people act again to try and hit that commencement milestone.

It’s not lost on me that there’s an irony here – the attempts to erode these credits might lead to a rush of projects moving faster, actually. Is that your sense?

There’s a slug of projects that would get accelerated and in fact just having this bill come out of the House is already going to accelerate a number of projects. But there’s limits to what you can do there. The bill also has a placed-in-service criteria and really problematic language with regard to the “foreign entity of concern” provisions.

Are you seeing any increase in opposition against solar projects? And is that the biggest hurdle you see to meeting that “placed-in-service” requirement?

What I have here is qualitative, not quantitative, but I was in the development business for 20 years, and what I have seen qualitatively is that it is increasingly harder to develop projects. Local opposition is one of the headwinds. Interconnection is another really big one and that’s the biggest concern I have with regards to the “placed-in-service” requirement. Most of these large projects, even if you overcome the NIMBY issues, and you get your permitting, and you do everything else you need to do, you get your permits and construction… In the end if you’re talking about projects at scale, there is a requirement that utilities do work. And there’s no requirement that utilities do that work on time [to meet that deadline]. This is a risk they need to manage.",https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MDM0NTcxMC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc4NTc0MzQ5Nn0.dGxtMRfpqCRDmEpXaYtcgCTCRf7yDqiUVJ35uH5qy9Y/image.jpg?width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C100%2C0%2C100,N,,2025-05-30 23:02:25.434247

Thus, the mere fact that another project’s environmental effects might be foreseeable is not enough.
The Court, moreover, explained that the adequacy of an agency’s NEPA review is a distinct question from an agency’s obligations under relevant substantive statutes.
The Supreme Court sent a clear and emphatic message to lower courts regarding the substantial deference owed to agencies under NEPA.
Those effects of the project itself, the Court explained, could constitute indirect effects that are properly within the scope of an agency’s NEPA review.","The Court’s decision is especially notable in two respects. First, it clarified that agencies may reasonably focus their environmental reviews on the project before them and need not consider effects of other separate projects, including those that fall within the jurisdiction of other agencies. The Seven County case arose from a decision by the Surface Transportation Board (“STB”) approving a short segment of planned railroad line in Utah, connecting an isolated oil production region to the national railroad grid. The Supreme Court held that, in approving the railway line, the STB had no obligation under NEPA to consider the potential impacts from crude oil production “upstream” of the railroad line, or from “downstream” oil refining or use of the transported oil. This holding marks a sea change in the context of large energy and other infrastructure projects, where the D.C. Circuit and other lower courts have for years required agencies to conduct extensive analysis of other projects and activities occurring “upstream” and “downstream” of the proposed agency action, including ever-expanding reviews of greenhouse gas emissions and climate change associated with activities far outside the acting agency’s jurisdiction.

Second, while that specific holding is extremely important in its own right for a broad range of energy and transportation infrastructure projects — from oil and gas pipelines to electric transmission lines — the Supreme Court’s decision also establishes broader guardrails that will guide environmental reviews by the full spectrum of federal agencies. The Supreme Court emphasized that reviewing courts must afford “substantial deference” to agencies under NEPA and should not second-guess agencies on the myriad technical judgment calls involved in conducting an environmental review, such as identifying potential environmental impacts, evaluating potential alternatives and their feasibility, and determining the scope of a proposed action’s environmental impacts and indirect effects.

Below we summarize the Court’s decision and provide several key takeaways.

Background

NEPA requires federal agencies undertaking “major Federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment” to prepare a “detailed statement” of, among other things, the “reasonably foreseeable environmental effects of the proposed agency action” and “a reasonable range of alternatives to the proposed agency action … that are technically and economically feasible, and meet the purpose and need of the proposal.”3 In other words, NEPA requires agencies to take a “hard look” at the potential environmental consequences of a proposed action. NEPA’s requirements, however, are fundamentally procedural in nature; so long as the agency identifies and discloses relevant environmental information, NEPA does not require a reviewing agency to reach any particular outcome and does not foreclose the agency from approving a project notwithstanding its environmental effects.

The STB regulates the construction and operation of interstate railroad lines. By statute, it approves a new line unless it finds that it is “inconsistent with the public convenience and necessity.”4 In 2020, the Seven County Infrastructure Coalition applied to the STB for approval of the Uinta Basin Railway, a proposed 88-mile railroad spur line that would connect the isolated, oil-producing Uinta Basin to the national rail network.

In considering the application, the STB prepared and published a 600-plus-page environmental analysis; with appendices and other technical information the environmental impact statement (“EIS”) exceeded 3,600 pages. In addition to thoroughly considering a broad range of effects of the proposed railway itself, the STB noted the possibility of potential environmental impacts from increased upstream oil drilling in the Uinta Basin and downstream refining of the crude oil that might be carried by the railroad line, but the agency declined to analyze those latter impacts at length. On the potential increase in upstream oil production, the STB determined that the activities in question (e.g., further oil and gas leasing and development) fell outside the agency’s authority and that potential effects were both speculative and attenuated in relation to the railroad line. Similarly, on potential downstream impacts, the STB explained that it lacked statutory authority over the refining or use of crude oil and that it could not reasonably identify the specific destinations and customers to be served by the railroad line. In reaching those determinations, the STB relied on the Supreme Court’s 2004 decision in Department of Transportation v. Public Citizen, in which the Court held that “where an agency has no ability to prevent a certain effect due to its limited statutory authority over the relevant actions,” its NEPA review need not include that effect.5

The D.C. Circuit, however, vacated the railroad approval, concluding that the agency’s NEPA review was inadequate on several grounds. Specifically, the court criticized the STB’s failure to more extensively analyze potential increased oil drilling upstream of the project and increased oil refining activities downstream of the project. In the D.C. Circuit’s view, those potential upstream and downstream impacts were reasonably foreseeable consequences of approving the railroad line and thus fell within the agency’s NEPA obligations to consider fully. The court rejected the STB’s argument that because the upstream and downstream activities themselves fell outside of the agency’s regulatory authority, their potential impacts need not be further analyzed as part of the EIS.

The Supreme Court’s Decision

The Supreme Court reversed, in an emphatic opinion that provides important clarity and certainty for agencies conducting NEPA reviews, courts reviewing claims challenging the adequacy of NEPA reviews, and the private parties and other stakeholders who rely on permits and other federal agency actions subject to NEPA.

The Supreme Court found two independent (but related) errors in the D.C. Circuit’s approach.

1. “A course correction” that restores “substantial [judicial] deference” to agency NEPA reviews

First, the Supreme Court reiterated that, contrary to the overly “aggressive” and “intrusive” approach taken by certain lower courts, “the bedrock principle of judicial review in NEPA cases” is “deference” to the agency. The Court emphasized that the “only” role for courts under NEPA is to “confirm that the agency has addressed environmental consequences and feasible alternatives to the relevant project,” and that in doing so a court must afford “substantial deference to the agency.” In practice, such deference will extend to the broad range of issues that arise in NEPA reviews — not only scientific and technical questions long understood to implicate agency expertise, but also the inevitable series of “fact-dependent, context-specific, and policy-laden choices about the depth and breadth of [a] [NEPA] inquiry” that affect the content and length of a NEPA document. These include:

the range of relevant environmental impacts to be considered and those impacts’ significance;

the range of potential alternatives and whether a particular alternative is feasible;

the range and geographic scope of indirect environmental impacts to be considered; and

the possibility and relevance of other projects separate in time or place (e.g., upstream, downstream, or otherwise) from the proposed action.

The Supreme Court explained that courts should not “micromanage” agency NEPA reviews so long as the agency’s choices fall within “a broad zone of reasonableness.” The Court pointedly criticized certain lower courts for having transformed NEPA from its original role as a “modest procedural requirement” into a “blunt and haphazard tool” to slow or even stop new infrastructure and construction projects, in a manner that has forced reviewing agencies “to take ever more time … to prepare ever longer EISs.”

The Supreme Court also emphasized that judicial review of an agency’s EIS “is not the same thing as review of the agency’s final decision concerning the project.” Thus, the ultimate question for reviewing courts is “not whether an EIS in and of itself is inadequate,” but rather whether “the agency’s final decision” — e.g., a permit or authorization issued pursuant to the agency’s substantive authority — “was reasonable and reasonably explained.” Thus, even if an EIS falls short in some respect, that deficiency does not necessarily require the Court to set aside (i.e., vacate) the agency’s ultimate approval of the project.

2. Limiting NEPA reviews to the “proposed action” before an agency — not other projects separate in time or space, or outside the action agency’s jurisdiction

Second, and independently, the Supreme Court refocused the required scope of NEPA reviews, holding that NEPA does not require an agency to consider environmental effects of other activities and projects “separate in time or place” from the proposed action, including projects that fall outside the action agency’s authority and that would be initiated by third parties. The Court thus held that (contrary to the D.C. Circuit’s approach) the STB need not consider upstream effects of potential increased oil production by third parties, or downstream effects of increased refining or ultimate use of oil transported on the proposed rail line. Under NEPA, the Court explained, an agency’s required review is focused on the “proposed action” at hand. It need not encompass other potential future projects or activities, or those that are geographically distinct from the proposed action, even if they might be “built (or expanded) as a result of or in the wake of the immediate project under consideration.”6

As the Supreme Court explained, those kinds of geographic, temporal, and agency-jurisdictional separations ultimately break the requisite causal chain “between the project at hand and the environmental effects of the separate project.” Under longstanding case law, an agency needs to consider environmental effects under NEPA only if they are reasonably foreseeable and have a “reasonably close causal relationship” to the proposed action. Thus, the mere fact that another project’s environmental effects might be foreseeable is not enough. Nor does it suffice that an agency’s approval of one project might be considered a mere “but-for” cause of other environmental effects; what is required is a “reasonably close causal relationship” akin to proximate cause. So, for instance, even if an agency’s approval of a new airport might lead to the construction of a new stretch of highway, or a new pipeline might lead to a new power plant, the agency approving the airport need not consider the environmental effects of the highway, nor must the agency approving the pipeline consider the effects of the power plant. As applied to the case at hand: “A relatively modest infrastructure project should not be turned into a scapegoat for everything that ensues from upstream oil drilling to downstream refinery emissions.”

Significantly, the Court also held that agencies “are not required to analyze the effects of projects over which they do not exercise regulatory authority.” Thus, because the STB has statutory authority over railroad lines but not oil drilling or refineries, the STB was not required to consider the environmental effects of those activities — which are regulated by other agencies.

The Court did recognize that in some instances, projects may be sufficiently interrelated and close in time and place as to constitute “a single project within the authority of the agency in question.” And the Court recognized that there may be line-drawing questions associated with defining the project being proposed to a specific agency for consideration. Even in those circumstances, the Court emphasized, a court’s review must remain deferential, and it should uphold the agency’s approach so long as it drew a reasonable and manageable line.

Key Takeaways

Far fewer NEPA challenges premised on upstream or downstream effects? As a top-line takeaway, Seven County reaffirms the common-sense principle that under NEPA, an agency can and should focus on the project or action actually proposed to it — e.g., approval of a railroad line, midstream oil or natural gas pipeline, or a highway project. NEPA does not mandate that agencies consider the environmental consequences of other projects that are separate in time or place from the proposed action before the agency, or which fall outside that agency’s regulatory jurisdiction. Just as the Court agreed with the STB that it need not consider the environmental consequences of upstream drilling or leasing decisions or downstream refining activities, so too now should courts uphold an action by FERC approving a pipeline without considering upstream effects of increased gas production, or downstream environmental effects from combusting natural gas in power plants, factories, or homes.

More broadly, Seven County delivers a strong rebuke of certain lower courts’ tendency to require agencies to consider a broad range of upstream and downstream effects, no matter how speculative or attenuated, especially when the agency has provided a reasonable explanation for why it was drawing a manageable line. The concern has been particularly pronounced in litigation regarding agency analysis of greenhouse gas emissions under NEPA. Much of this caselaw has grown from the D.C. Circuit’s 2017 decision in Sabal Trail, which held that certain downstream greenhouse gas emissions from combusting gas transported in a FERC-jurisdictional pipeline constituted indirect effects under NEPA.7 Although Seven County does not say so explicitly, it is difficult to read the decision as anything but a de facto overruling of Sabal Trail and subsequent decisions requiring FERC and other agencies to consider a range of upstream and downstream indirect effects under NEPA.

Restoring NEPA’s role as a “modest,” purely procedural statute: The Court in Seven County took great pains to reiterate that unlike environmental statutes that impose substantive environmental obligations, such as the Clean Air Act or Clean Water Act, NEPA is “purely procedural.” As such, NEPA does not require an agency to weigh or favor environmental consequences in any particular way, or to reach any particular environmental result. The Court, moreover, explained that the adequacy of an agency’s NEPA review is a distinct question from an agency’s obligations under relevant substantive statutes. The Court’s admonition that defects in an agency’s EIS do not necessarily warrant vacatur of an agency’s ultimate action should also provide a welcome check on the hair-trigger approach of some lower courts, which have too readily set aside major infrastructure permits and authorizations based on perceived NEPA foot faults.

Stepping back from the particulars of this case, Seven County can be understood as another link in a chain of Supreme Court cases — like Vermont Yankee, Metropolitan Edison, and Public Citizen — intended to curb lower courts’ unduly aggressive applications of NEPA. The Court was clear that its opinion was intended as “[a] course correction” to “bring judicial review under NEPA back in line with the statutory text and common sense.”

Deference to agencies. The Supreme Court sent a clear and emphatic message to lower courts regarding the substantial deference owed to agencies under NEPA. Going forward, the Court was clear that it expects many technical, scientific, and line-drawing decisions to fall to the discretion of the agency and not be second-guessed by courts. And the Court sought to put an end to the vicious cycle of risk-averse agencies resorting to ever extended review times and ever longer NEPA documents in an effort to survive judicial review.

The Court’s vigorous call for judicial deference under NEPA contrasts sharply with the requirement of independent judicial review of questions of law under Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo.8 The Seven County decision builds on, and helps illustrate, guidance from Loper Bright and other cases about the continued role for deferential judicial review of discretionary, technical, and agency policy decisions under the Administrative Procedure Act, notwithstanding independent judicial review on questions of law.

Deference, of course, means that agencies will retain a zone of discretion about the content and scope of their environmental reviews. The Court recognized that an agency’s discretion extends to questions such as the scope of indirect environmental effects, and whether the agency might voluntarily address effects from future or geographically separate projects that may be “initiated (or expanded) as a result of or in the wake of the current project.” But the Court made clear that NEPA does not compel an agency to consider such factors. And it underscored that in the event an agency denies a permit or authorization, an applicant could argue (among other things) that the agency acted unreasonably by “weighing environmental consequences too heavily in light of the agency’s governing statute” or perhaps that the relevant statute “did not allow the agency to weigh environmental consequences at all.” Those kinds of substantive arguments, the Court explained, were unaffected by NEPA.

Separate projects. As explained previously, the Court held that agencies are not required under NEPA to examine the environmental consequences of projects that are geographically or temporally distinct from the proposed action, or that fall outside the agency’s jurisdiction. In doing so, the Court cited examples like a new airport someday leading to a new highway; a new pipeline to a new power plant; or a new housing development to a new subway stop.

The Court cautioned, however, that certain projects may be interrelated or close enough in time or place that they constitute a single project that falls within the agency’s jurisdiction. In that instance, the environmental effects of two nominally separate projects may well warrant consideration in a single environmental document.9 But as framed by the Court’s opinion, that rationale would apply only to multiple projects that fall “within the authority of the [single] agency in question.” And even then, a reviewing court should afford deference to the agency’s line-drawing decisions.

The concurrence and the “public convenience and necessity” standard. Justice Sotomayor, joined by Justices Kagan and Jackson, concurred only in the judgment. They would have reached the same result as the Court, but on a narrower ground. In the concurring Justices’ view, the STB did not need to consider upstream or downstream effects of oil production or consumption because the STB lacked statutory authority to reject railroad applications based on how third parties would use the products transported on the railway line. This principle followed from the statutory common-carrier requirements of the Interstate Commerce Act, and the bounds of what factors the Board could properly consider in applying the statutory “public convenience and necessity” standard. In the concurring Justices’ view, the “public convenience and necessity” standard must be understood in the context of the statute’s broader purpose, including the common-carrier requirement.

If adopted by lower courts, the concurring opinion’s gloss on the statutory “public convenience and necessity” standard could have follow-on effects in other statutory contexts involving the same language, notably including Section 7 of the Natural Gas Act (“NGA”), which governs FERC’s approval of interstate natural gas pipeline projects. The concurring Justices’ formulation of the “public convenience and necessity” standard appears narrower than the D.C. Circuit’s expansive understanding of that concept, as articulated in cases such as Sabal Trail.10 As a result, it could narrow the scope of what kinds of factors FERC must substantively consider under the NGA, with potential similar effects on other similarly worded statutes.

6 The Court recognized that the potential effects of the proposed action itself may in some circumstances “extend outside the geographical territory of the project or might materialize later in time,” such as run-off from project construction that could affect downstream waters or air emissions from a proposed facility that might travel downwind to other areas. Those effects of the project itself, the Court explained, could constitute indirect effects that are properly within the scope of an agency’s NEPA review. See Seven County Slip Op. 16.

Matt Edling, speaking on behalf of the city, said, “This lawsuit is not seeking to solve climate change, but quite candidly, it’s so the city has the money to survive it.”","Two teams of high-powered lawyers clashed this week in Charleston, S.C., over a global-warming question with major implications: Do climate lawsuits against oil companies threaten national security, as President Trump has claimed?

In the lawsuit, the City of Charleston is arguing that oil companies including ExxonMobil, Chevron and about a dozen others carried out a sophisticated, decades-long misinformation campaign to cover up what they knew about the dangers of climate change.

There are some three dozen similar cases around the country, and recently Mr. Trump issued an executive order calling the lawsuits a threat to national security, saying they could lead to crippling damages. The hearings in Charleston were the first time lawyers had to grapple in a courtroom with the president’s assertions.

Mr. Trump’s executive order was the opening salvo in a broad new attack by his administration against climate lawsuits targeting oil companies. Citing the executive order, the Justice Department this month filed unusual lawsuits against Hawaii and Michigan seeking to prevent them from filing their own climate-change suits. (Hawaii filed its suit anyway, and Michigan’s attorney general has signaled that she will also be proceeding.)

Theodore J. Boutrous Jr. of Gibson Dunn, who represents Chevron but was arguing on behalf of all the defendants, said the executive order was consistent with their position that federal law governs emissions and their impact, and that the climate-change lawsuits do not belong in state courtrooms.

Mr. Boutrous also said to the court that both Democrats and Republicans have promoted fossil fuel production in the interest of national security. Grappling with climate change is “not a partisan issue,” he said. “This is a difficult policy issue.”

Victor Sher, a lawyer for Charleston, said Congress is responsible for writing laws, not the president through the use of executive orders. But, setting that aside, he argued that the order was not relevant to Charleston’s case, because the lawsuit would not interfere with energy production. Rather, he said, the case revolved around the companies’ past acts of deception and failure to warn consumers about the risks of its products.

Judge Young appeared skeptical of the city’s claims. “It’s the weather we’re talking about,” he said.

The judge also asked whether cases like this meant that individuals could also sue over climate-change claims. He said he was concerned about “perpetual” lawsuits of this kind. “I’m trying to figure out how this ends,” Judge Young said.

Mr. Sher likened the litigation to lawsuits against industries like tobacco, opioids and asbestos. “There are innumerable instances where all levels of government have sued over corporate misconduct,” he said.

Mr. Boutrous cited a Supreme Court decision, written in 2011 by the liberal jurist Ruth Bader Ginsburg, in which she wrote that disputes over greenhouse-gas emissions by power companies fall under the purview of federal agencies and federal judges. Energy-company lawyers often cite that decision as a key precedent in their arguments in other lawsuits against oil companies across the country.

Global warming is mainly caused by the burning of fossil fuels like oil, gas and coal, which release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, where they act like a heat-trapping blanket.

Much of the debate centered on whether the city’s case sought to restrict emissions. Mr. Sher said Charleston’s goal was not to limit emissions, but rather to generate money to help cover the costs of climate change — costs such as fortifying Charleston’s sea walls, improving drainage and protecting against hurricane damage. Taxpayers “would otherwise have to bear that burden,” he said.

The judge pressed Mr. Sher to describe whether gasoline ads should include a message about climate change, like the warnings about side effects in drug commercials.

The oil companies first tried, without success, to get cases like these moved out of state courts and into federal courts, where they felt they would have better chances of winning. None of the state court cases have yet gone to trial, but judges in numerous places have ruled against the companies’ motions to dismiss, including in Hawaii and Colorado, where state appellate courts upheld the decisions.

However, in other jurisdictions, including Pennsylvania, Maryland and New Jersey, energy companies have succeeded in getting cases tossed. And in Puerto Rico, the governor moved to dismiss a lawsuit filed by her predecessor.

The Charleston case has been the subject of debate locally. It was filed under a previous mayor, John Tecklenburg, and critics have called for his successor, William Cogswell, to drop the case. His office said it would be watching the proceedings closely. The state’s attorney general, Alan Wilson, has been a vocal opponent of climate-change lawsuits and filed an amicus brief in favor of the companies in the Charleston case.

As the hearings concluded on Friday, Judge Young asked whether it made sense for a global problem to be addressed in a South Carolina court. Matt Edling, speaking on behalf of the city, said, “This lawsuit is not seeking to solve climate change, but quite candidly, it’s so the city has the money to survive it.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/30/multimedia/30cli-sc-lawsuit-01-fpwt/30cli-sc-lawsuit-01-fpwt-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-05-30 22:03:41.844960

In one recent week, nearly half of Texas’s electricity came from solar and wind power.
There does exist public support for clean energy in Wyoming, which is why Hicks’ initiative failed.
The Sierra Madre Wind Energy Project, now under construction near Rawlins, will be the nation’s largest wind farm.","Wyoming is the second windiest state, after Nebraska. It’s obvious why the wind power industry is investing $10 billion there. And it’s hard to see why any state politician would oppose this. But some have. Wyoming is one of those fossil-fuel producing states in which so-called conservatives feel obligated — or are paid — to stop competition from clean energy. Texas is another.

Wyoming State Sen. Larry Hicks proposed a temporary ban on renewable energy projects. “It does one thing: puts a moratorium on wind and solar for the next five years,” he said. “It’s a simple little bill.”

A “simple,” five-year plan? How do you say, “Aw, shucks” in Russian?

Hicks swiftly diverted blame to California: “Our friends on the ‘left coast’ with their renewable portfolio demands, eliminating fossil fuels and moving in a direction that’s unsustainable.”

We can’t untie this knot of confused ideology. But let’s point out that renewable energy is the only kind of energy that is, by definition, sustainable. Wyoming may have coal, oil and gas. But it has wind forever.

This hostility toward wind power is even weirder in Texas. Texas harvests more electricity from wind than any other state, or nearly 28% of all wind-generated electricity in the U.S. In one recent week, nearly half of Texas’s electricity came from solar and wind power.

The key for these renewables is batteries that can store power when the wind doesn’t blow or the sun doesn’t shine. Texas has been crowned “ground zero” for a U.S. battery boom. Last year it switched on more power stored in batteries than California did.

Texas was expected to double its storage capacity this year — that is, until Donald Trump slapped huge tariffs on China. More than two-thirds of imported batteries come from China.

In March, the Texas Senate passed a mandate that half of all new power capacity come from sources other than battery storage. In other words, at least 50% of all new power plant capacity had to be produced from coal, natural gas and oil. (The natural gas industry needed propping.)

Back in Wyoming, lawmakers wedded to fossil fuels are complaining that large wind and solar projects are fundamentally changing the look of Wyoming’s wide-open spaces. That’s ignoring the aesthetics of Wyoming’s coal pits, wide open craters that stretch for miles.

Wyoming is over 63 times the size of Rhode Island, with less than half the population of the Ocean State. There are dozens of wind turbines in Rhode Island, onshore and off. More are planned with minimal complaint. Wyoming could easily accommodate new wind projects under its big sky.

There does exist public support for clean energy in Wyoming, which is why Hicks’ initiative failed. Gov. Mark Gordon tried to bridge the differences by endorsing an “all of the above energy strategy.” He wants to keep Wyoming as “the energy state” but also to address climate change by developing clean renewables.

The far-right Freedom Caucus went after Gordon for acknowledging climate change. It introduced a bill designed to stop the state from pursuing any carbon reduction targets and titled it “Make Carbon Dioxide Great Again.”

A pragmatic Republican, Gordon called such proposals as “a little bit stupid.”

The bottom line is that Wyoming continues to develop wind energy projects. The Sierra Madre Wind Energy Project, now under construction near Rawlins, will be the nation’s largest wind farm.

Much of what happens from here on in depends on Washington. The recently passed House bill strips away subsidies for renewables. How it fares in the Senate remains to be seen. Suffice it to say, slowing America’s move to cleaner and also cheaper energy is more than a little bit stupid.

The grants, largely awarded during former President Joe Biden's final few months in the White House, were primarily for programs to capture carbon emissions and store them underground. Other targeted efforts span cleaner cement, natural gas and more.

Some of the 24 canceled awards include $500 million to Heidelberg Materials US, Inc.; $375 million to Eastman Chemical Company; $95 million to Nevada Gold Mines, LLC; and $270 million to Sutter CCUS, among others, according to a list provided by the Department of Energy. Sublime Systems, which lost an $87 million grant, was “surprised and disappointed,” the company said in a statement.

“Today’s action is bad for U.S. competitiveness in the global market and also directly contradictory to the administration’s stated goals of supporting energy production and environmental innovation,” said Conrad Schneider, a senior director at the Clean Air Task Force. It “undercuts U.S. competitiveness at a time when there is a growing global market for cleaner industrial products and technologies.”

The news was a swift follow-up to plans the Energy Department announced earlier this month to review 179 funded projects, totaling over $15 billion, that were awarded by the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations created under the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law.

It is part of Wright's pledge to ensure “responsible” spending — aligning with the government's broader efficiency and cost-cutting measures, such as those recommended by the Department of Government Efficiency, which has significantly impacted federal research, workers and agencies.

“While the previous administration failed to conduct a thorough financial review before signing away billions of taxpayer dollars, the Trump administration is doing our due diligence to ensure we are utilizing taxpayer dollars to strengthen our national security, bolster affordable, reliable energy sources and advance projects that generate the highest possible return on investment,"" Wright said in Friday's statement.

The 10 Oldest U.S. Presidents

Carbon capture has been a controversial climate solution, as skeptics say it enables the continued burning of fossil fuels oil, coal and natural gas that emit planet-warming greenhouse gases — including carbon dioxide — and distracts from the need to cut ties with those energy sources altogether. Though investment in the technology has grown, it also remains challenging to scale.

Industry decries the news

Organizations quickly decried the secretary's actions, stressing that the cancelations don't align with the administration's goals to bolster domestic manufacturing or energy independence.

Jessie Stolark, the executive director of the nonpartisan Carbon Capture Coalition, said the news “is a major step backward"" for carbon management technologies, which are “crucial to meeting America’s growing demand for affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy.”

“These projects are not just reducing pollution, they are keeping the U.S. on the cutting edge of manufacturing technology,"" said Mike Williams, senior fellow on the energy and environment team at public policy and advocacy group the Center for American Progress. ""Canceling these important projects will raise energy prices for consumers and sacrifice thousands of high-quality union jobs, all because the president wants to curry favor with Big Oil.”

Evan Gillespie, partner at decarbonization organization, Industrious Labs, said the move dismantles the economy and the future of American manufacturing and its workforce.

“Killing these projects means more emissions, more pollution, and more people getting sick,” he said.

HOUSTON (Reuters) -Cheniere Energy said on Friday it has begun annual maintenance work on its liquefied natural gas plant in Sabine Pass, Texas, the largest U.S. LNG plant.

Sabine Pass has annual capacity of 30 million metric tonnes per annum (mtpa) and has played a major role in making the U.S. the world's largest exporter of LNG.

""Planned maintenance activity is underway at Sabine Pass,"" a Cheniere spokesperson told Reuters by email.

Declines in U.S. LNG output usually have an impact on global prices.

The annual maintenance work is expected to reduce U.S. output of LNG for the next few weeks.

Gas flows to Cheniere's 4.5-bcfd Sabine Pass plant were on track to drop from 3.9 bcfd on Thursday to an 11-month low of 3.7 bcfd on Friday, while feedgas to the company's 3.9-bcfd Corpus Christi in Texas was on track to drop from 2.1 bcfd on Thursday to a two-week low of 1.6 bcfd on Friday.

Energy traders have said they expect total LNG feedgas to remain below April's record high in June with Cheniere planning about three weeks of maintenance on liquefaction trains at Sabine around June 2-23.

The disappearance of the credits would threaten Ford’s projected $3 billion investment in a Marshall, Michigan, plant that is 60% complete and slated to employ 1,700 workers.

Ford said at a policy conference of the factory 100 miles (161 km) west of Detroit,

If it doesn’t stay, it will imperil what we do in Marshall,

“We made a certain investment based upon a policy that was in place. It’s not fair to change policies after all the expenditure has been made.”

Ford said the plant, which was announced in February 2023, is expected to begin producing batteries in 2026.

The tax-reform bill passed by the U.S. House of Representatives this month could bar lucrative tax credits for batteries produced with components made by some Chinese companies or under a license agreement with Chinese firms.

Ford’s factory would make battery cells using tech from Chinese battery giant CATL (300750.SZ)

Ford said on Thursday,

I’m spending a lot of time talking about that with politicians. It’s a federal issue, but it’s also a state issue,

Ford received a reduced incentive package from Michigan last year for the battery plant after it cut expected production there to match slowing demand for electric vehicles. Since the automaker announced the plant, it has drawn scrutiny from some lawmakers for its ties to the Chinese company.

The company touted a letter from more than 100 Marshall-area business owners, school leaders, elected officials calling on Congress to retain the tax incentives, which noted the area has “lost thousands of jobs over the past several years.”

The House bill would also end a $7,500 tax credit for new EVs, impose a new $250 annual fee on EVs for road repair costs and repeal vehicle emissions rules designed to prod automakers into building more EVs. The U.S. Senate plans to take up the bill and make changes in the coming month.

According to clean energy advocate Evergreen Action, Minnesota has gained more than $1 billion in new clean energy investments and nearly 1,800 new jobs since the IRA was approved in August of 2022.
Several analyses show that much of the tax credits are going to states where majorities voted for Trump.","This story was originally published by MinnPost.

WASHINGTON — Gov. Tim Walz vigorously leveraged federal “green” tax credits — for electric cars, solar panels and other clean energy technologies and projects — that are now on the chopping block as Congress moves forward on President Donald Trump’s game-changing budget.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act that would cut social programs, extend Trump’s first-term tax breaks and raise the nation’s debt ceiling, would phase out former President Joe Biden’s ambitious plans to combat greenhouse gases — and hopefully make energy more affordable — by providing tax incentives to individuals and industry.

The proposal, approved by the U.S. House earlier this year, will likely be revised by the U.S. Senate. But when it comes to corporate efforts to invest in clean technologies, the bill has already had a chilling effect.

Canadian company Heliene, a maker of panels and other components of solar energy systems, said it’s holding off on its decision to build a new plant in Minnesota until the fate of the tax credits is clear.

Heliene CEO Martin Pochtaruk told MinnPost that a main concern is a power generation tax credit that benefits company clients that use the sun to generate electricity.

As it stands, the massive budget bill in the House is what Bloomberg called a “nightmare scenario for U.S. clean energy advocates.”

Under the legislation, wind, solar, geothermal and other emission-neutral projects would need to begin construction within 60 days of the bill's final passage — or start operations within two years — to receive the credits before they expire, mostly in 2028.

Currently, those credits could lower the cost of a project by 30% and were available for zero-emission projects until the early 2030s.

However, Harry Godfrey, managing director at Advanced Energy United, a clean energy business association, said a “poison pill’ was inserted into the program in the form of the new 60-day deadline.

“The bill was problematic to begin with,” Godfrey said. “But this was a meat cleaver.”

In addition, under the bill, any clean energy company that uses Chinese imports to build a facility or generate energy would be barred from receiving federal money. And the $7,500 tax break available to buyers of certain electric vehicles would be eliminated by the end of next year.

To add insult to injury, the legislation would also impose a $250 annual fee on owners of electric vehicles to compensate for lost revenue from gasoline taxes.

The bill would also phase out tax credits for home energy efficiency improvements and residential clean energy installations like solar panels.

“The clean energy transition is happening,” said Sen. Tina Smith, D-Minn., a champion of the clean energy provisions. ""The only question is if America will lead or follow, and I think we should lead.”

She called “recklessly” ending the incentives businesses are counting on to build “cheaper, cleaner energy” would force the United States to fall behind the rest of the world.

“We’re already seeing that these proposed changes are bad for business here in Minnesota,” Smith said. “Heliene paused construction of their solar manufacturing facility because of the cuts Republicans are pushing, and countless other projects are in limbo.”

‘Green New Scam’

Some of the clean energy tax breaks have existed for years and were implemented during the Carter, Bush and Obama administrations. But Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act expanded and extended them and added a few new ones to combat greenhouse gas emissions.

That effort was championed by Walz, who signed a law requiring utilities to provide 100% percent clean electricity in the state by 2040.

But Trump has waged war on the Inflation Reduction Act, calling it a “Green New Scam” and a waste of money and vowed to overturn most of its provision.

Still, the IRA’s tax credits have helped ramp up corporate investment in clean energy in Minnesota.

For instance, they helped Xcel Energy build a huge solar project near its Sherco coal plant site in Becker.

“Energy production tax credits provide numerous benefits to our customers and communities,” said Xcel Energy spokesman Kevin Coss. “We pass 100% of the savings to customers in the form of lower electricity rates, helping keep bills low.”

Coss also said Xcel uses the federal tax credits on projects that create jobs, raise local tax revenue and drive economic development, an argument echoed by clean energy advocates.

Another project attracted to the state by the promise of federal money is a “green” hydrogen production plant in Fridley. Green hydrogen is generated through the electrolysis of water using renewable energy sources like solar or wind power.

According to clean energy advocate Evergreen Action, Minnesota has gained more than $1 billion in new clean energy investments and nearly 1,800 new jobs since the IRA was approved in August of 2022.

“The governor has made Minnesota a leader in clean technology and renewable energy by supporting electric vehicles and putting the state on a path toward 100% clean energy by 2040,” said Claire Lancaster, the governor’s spokeswoman. “But Minnesota stands to lose billions in federal funding that lowers energy costs by helping Minnesotans move toward more energy-efficient homes, cars, and electricity.

Lancaster also said that besides eliminating thousands of jobs, the legislation would leave Minnesotans more vulnerable to pollution, extreme weather events and the health and safety risks that they bring.

‘On track to raise energy bills’

The Senate is expected to make changes in the House-passed bill and clean energy boosters and the clean technology and energy industries are turning their full attention on the chamber.

Coss, of Xcel Energy, said “we are working closely with our industry partners, trade associations, and other stakeholders to ensure federal policymakers are made aware of the important benefits of these tax policies for their constituents.”

Green tax credit supporters say the end to innovation in the green energy industry will result in increased energy costs for homeowners, small businesses and industry, a 10% increase over the next few years as demand for energy grows.

“(Congress) is on track to raise people’s energy bills,” said Evergreen Action spokesman Seth Nelson.

Lobbying to save the tax credits has focused on four GOP senators who have sizable clean energy investments in their states because getting the bill through the Senate won’t be easy.

“I do think there are some persuadable senators,” Nelson said.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., cannot lose more than three GOP votes because no Democrat is expected to support it.

And four Republican senators have expressed concerns over the elimination of the credits.

Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Thom Tillis of North Carolina, John Curtis of Utah and Jerry Moran of Kansas sent Thune a letter last month warning against the obliteration of the IRA — and especially the green tax credits.

“Our country is blessed with abundant natural resources and an entrepreneurial spirit that uniquely positions us to power both our economy and the world — enabling U.S. leadership in innovation, energy production, and manufacturing alike,” the senators wrote. “Many of the investments that make this possible are enabled by current tax provisions, including some from the Inflation Reduction Act.”

At a press conference at a clean energy company in Utah this week, Curtis said he would “make sure that we’re taking into account our energy future.”

Other GOP senators are being targeted too. Several analyses show that much of the tax credits are going to states where majorities voted for Trump.

President Joe Biden's signature climate bill included several tax credits designed to help establish an EV supply chain and support consumer demand for plug-in cars.

Republican lawmakers are moving to unwind those policies. In addition to phasing out a $7,500 consumer tax credit for electric vehicles, the House-passed bill would end a manufacturing credit for battery makers after 2031.

It would also mandate strict restrictions against the use of Chinese components and materials that analysts say could effectively render it useless.

The complaint, filed Thursday in the U.S. District Court in Montana, challenges three executive orders: “Unleashing American Energy,” “Declaring a National Energy Emergency” and “Reinvigorating America’s Beautiful Clean Coal Industry.” The lawsuit argues that with the orders, the Trump administration knowingly is advancing an agenda that will increase greenhouse gas pollution that already is stressing the global climate to a dangerous extent.

The litigation argues the situation infringes on the young people’s constitutional rights to life and liberty, as well as falling afoul of other laws approved by Congress that protect public health and the environment. The plaintiffs want the court to declare the executive orders unconstitutional, block their implementation and reaffirm the legal limits on presidential power.

“From day one of the current administration, President Trump has issued directives to increase fossil fuel use and production and block an energy transition to wind, solar, battery storage, energy efficiency, and electric vehicles (“EVs”),” the lawsuit states. “President Trump’s EOs falsely claim an energy emergency, while the true emergency is that fossil fuel pollution is destroying the foundation of Plaintiffs’ lives.”

The complaint was filed on behalf of young people from Montana to Florida, ranging in age from 7 to 25, who have experienced wildfires, floods, hurricanes and extreme heat. Some have been displaced from their homes.

Others have endured health harms, such as a 7-year-old boy, identified by the initials J.K. in the lawsuit because he is a minor, who suffers from frequent respiratory infections. The infections are exacerbated by wildfire smoke and have landed him in the hospital. Greenhouse gas emissions, including those associated with fossil fuels, are heating the global climate, shifting weather patterns and leading to more extreme events such as wildfires and hurricanes.

Many of the plaintiffs are pursuing college degrees and careers in environmental science, and their research and professional goals have been disrupted as the Trump administration has eliminated jobs and funding for clean energy, climate research and decarbonization. Ula Jones, 18, was told by professors that some classes she planned to take may be eliminated. A 17-year-old who is identified by the initials J.M. in the litigation had helped her school secure a $400,000 grant from the Environmental Protection Agency for two electric buses, but the school never received the funding.

Some plaintiffs also have experienced mental anguish over the uncertainty climate change has cast on their futures. Among them is Olivia Vesovich, 21, who lives in Missoula, Montana.

“There are days when Olivia feels paralyzed by the devastation wrought by climate change to her state and community,” the lawsuit states. “Olivia’s climate anxiety is like an elephant sitting on her chest; it feels like a crushing weight, making it hard for her to breathe.”

The plaintiffs are represented by Our Children’s Trust, the Oregon-based advocacy group that previously brought the closely watched case Juliana v. United States, which sought to hold the federal government accountable for an energy system based on fossil fuels. That lawsuit claimed the government knew since 1965 that burning fossil fuels would lead to dangerous climate change.

The U.S. Supreme Court declined this spring to hear the case, ending the 10-year legal effort. But Our Children’s Trust said the legal framework established by Juliana inspired more than 60 youth-led lawsuits worldwide. In 2023 the group celebrated a groundbreaking victory in Montana, the first time a court in the U.S. declared that a government had a constitutional responsibility to protect people from climate change. The next year the group reached a settlement in Hawaii that included a plan to decarbonize the state’s transportation system.

Our Children’s Trust filed the latest litigation over the Trump administration’s executive orders in partnership with the Gregory Law Group, McGarvey Law and Public Justice.

In addition to President Donald Trump, the lawsuit names as defendants multiple administration leaders and departments, including the EPA, Department of Transportation, National Science Foundation and the Department of Health and Human Services.

“The American people are more concerned with the future generations’ economic and national security, which is why they elected President Trump in a landslide victory to restore America’s energy dominance,” said Taylor Rogers, White House assistant press secretary, in a statement provided to Inside Climate News. “Future generations should not have to foot the bill of the lefts’ radical climate agenda.”

A recent report by risk management experts warned that climate change could cut the worldwide gross domestic product in half between 2070 and 2090. And last year, the U.S. was hit by 27 billion-dollar disasters.

Eva Lighthiser, a 19-year-old recent high school graduate living in Livingston, Montana, is one of the plaintiffs. Flooding destroyed roads and bridges near where she lived, forcing her family to relocate to a different town. Wildfire smoke leaves her short of breath and causes other symptoms such as headaches. She plans to study environmental science in college and worries about whether the Trump administration may limit her access to climate science and data.

This will support water systems across the country, including small systems in rural communities, as they work to address these contaminants.
These PFAS chemicals were part of the April 2024 national drinking water standards.
""We share the goal of protecting access to safe drinking water for all Americans, and we strongly support the establishment of a science-based drinking water standard for PFOA and PFOS,"" the ACC said in its May 14 statement.
The ACC said EPA's proposal to amend the drinking water regulation looks to address the concerns of water utilities and local governments, focus on national drinking water priorities and minimize the impact on water bills.","WASHINGTON—The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said it will keep maximum contaminant levels (MCL) in drinking water for two of the PFAS chemicals thought to be the most egregious of the ""forever chemicals.""

At the same time, however, the agency plans to extend the time to meet the target levels into 2031, and rescind and reconsider whether four other PFAS materials should be part of the drinking water regulation.

The actions taken by the EPA—now under the direction of Administrator Lee Zeldin in the second President Trump administration—brought a variety of reactions by both business and environmental groups.

The American Chemistry Council and National Organization of Manufacturers praised parts of the new direction, but also criticized some of what was outlined in the EPA's May 14 reveal of part of its new road map for PFAS.

Environmental groups, however, said backtracking on the other four PFAS chemicals that were part of the April 2024 first national drinking water standard for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances that was put through during the Biden Administration will weaken the landmark protections.

The EPA said in its May 14 news release that it is committed to addressing PFAS in drinking water while ""following the law and ensuring compliance is achievable for drinking water systems.""

""The work to protect Americans from PFAS in drinking water started under the first Trump Administration and will continue under my leadership,"" Zeldin said in a statement. ""We are on a path to uphold the agency's nationwide standards to protect Americans from PFOA and PFOS in their water. At the same time, we will work to provide common-sense flexibility in the form of additional time for compliance. This will support water systems across the country, including small systems in rural communities, as they work to address these contaminants. EPA will also continue to use its regulatory and enforcement tools to hold polluters accountable.""

The EPA, as part of this action, said it intends to extend compliance deadlines for PFOA and PFOS to reach the drinking water standard's MCL of between 4 and 10 parts per trillion from 2029 to 2031. EPA plans to issue a proposed rule this fall and finalize it by the spring of 2026. The agency also will encourage states seeking to be the primary authorities to implement the PFAS drinking water regulation to request additional time from EPA to develop their applications.

At the same time, EPA will support the U.S. Department of Justice in defending ongoing legal challenges to the PFAS National Primary Drinking Water Regulation with respect to PFOA and PFOS.

The EPA also said it will establish a federal exemption framework and boost outreach to water systems—particularly those in small and rural communities—through a new PFAS OUTreach Inititiative, or PFAS OUT for short. ""This action would help address the most significant compliance challenges EPA has heard from public water systems, members of Congress and other stakeholders, while supporting actions to protect the American people from certain PFAS in drinking water,"" the EPA said in its news release.

The agency added that when paired with effluent limitations guidelines for PFAS and other tools to ensure that polluters are held responsible, EPA's actions are designed to reduce the burden on drinking water systems and the cost of water bills, ""all while continuing to protect public health and ensure that the agency is following the law in establishing impactful regulations such as these.""

This includes announcing its intent to rescind the regulations and take another look at the regulatory determinations for PFHxS, PFNA, HFPO-DA (commonly known as GenX), and the Hazard Index mixture of these three plus PFBS to ensure that the determinations and any resulting drinking water regulation follow the legal process laid out in the Safe Drinking Water Act. These PFAS chemicals were part of the April 2024 national drinking water standards.

Zeldin said a big part of the EPA's efforts will be aimed at keeping the polluters accountable, rather than the drinking water systems the agency sees as ""passive receivers of PFOA and PFOS."" He added the EPA will take a number of actions to reduce the amount of PFAS in the environment, including in sources of drinking water, which in turn can reduce the cost burden for the water systems.

The American Chemistry Council spent a good part of its comments on the EPA's proposed update to the PFAS drinking water standard by criticizing how the April 2024 rule was put into place during the Biden Administration.

""We share the goal of protecting access to safe drinking water for all Americans, and we strongly support the establishment of a science-based drinking water standard for PFOA and PFOS,"" the ACC said in its May 14 statement. ""With scarce resources and other water priorities, we need to thoughtfully follow sound science when developing these standards.""

But it claimed the regulation the EPA put in place last year was not consistent with the state of science or the requirements of the Safe Drinking Water Act. It said the proposal was criticized by EPA's own Science Advisory Board and would impact ""millions of ratepayers across the country and impose severe consequences on many stakeholders, including local governments and water agencies.""

The ACC said EPA's proposal to amend the drinking water regulation looks to address the concerns of water utilities and local governments, focus on national drinking water priorities and minimize the impact on water bills.

""However, EPA's actions only partially address this issue, and more is needed to prevent significant impacts on local communities and other unintended consequences,"" the ACC said in its statement. ""The question is not whether to regulate specific substances but how to best do so in a manner that is consistent with the state of the science and focuses on the most pressing drinking water priorities for local communities.""

Jay Timmons, president and CEO of the National Manufacturers Association, said the NAM was encouraged that the EPA listened to the voices of manufacturers in looking to extend the compliance deadline for drinking water standards for PFOA and PFOS, along with looking to reconsider the regulatory determinations of the other PFAS compounds included in the April 2024 standard.

But he added that the EPA's decision to leave the standards for PFOA and PFOS in place doesn't match what Trump has been trying to accomplish for manufacturing.

""In addition to conflicting with manufacturers' best interests, these standards also go against the Trump administration's goal to make the U.S. the best place to build, grow and create jobs—a goal the administration is advancing by rebalancing regulations,"" Timmons said May 14. ""The administration has done remarkable work to advance that goal, but today's decision moves in the opposite direction.

""The decision runs counter to past efforts to cut red tape and boost manufacturing by putting shovels in the ground, more people to work, more products on the shelves and more prosperity into our communities. We don't have to choose between supporting manufacturing and clean water in our communities.""

The Environmental Working Group and National Resources Defense Council (NRDC) both were critical of the EPA's decision to delay implementation of the MCLs on PFOS and PFOA, along with the decision to rescind the limits on the four other PFAS chemicals.

""You can't make America healthy while allowing toxic chemicals to flow freely from our taps,"" EWG President Ken Cook said in a statement. ""The EPA is caving to chemical industry lobbyists and pressure by the water utilities, and in doing so, it's sentencing millions of Americans to drink contaminated water for years to come.

""The cost of PFAS pollution will fall on ordinary people, who will pay in the form of polluted water and more sickness, more suffering and more deaths from PFAS-related diseases.""

The EWG said the PFAS contamination crisis is much larger than just two chemicals, and the current EPA plan to reverse the four MCLs is counter to an anti-backsliding provision in the Safe Drinking Water Act that requires that any revision to a drinking water standard ""maintain, or provide for greater, protection of the health of persons.""

It added that companies—including fluoropolymer producers 3M and DuPont—for decades hid the health harms of PFAS from regulators, workers and neighboring communities. PFAS have been linked to cancer, reproductive harm, immune system damage and other serious health problems, even at low levels, according to the EWG.

""Communities have waited decades for protection—now the EPA is pulling the rug out,"" said Melanie Benesh, EWG vice president of government affairs. ""Science is clear: PFAS are dangerous even in tiny amounts. The agency must protect all Americans, not just from two chemicals, but from the entire class of harmful PFAS.""

The NRDC said about half of the U.S. population is drinking PFAS-contaminated water, including as many as 105 million whose water violates the new standards. It maintained the EPA has known for decades that PFAS endangers human health, including kidney and testicular cancer, liver damage, and harm to the nervous and reproductive systems.

After the April 2024 PFAS drinking standard was put in place, the NRDC said the chemical industries along with water utility trade associations sued to block the rule. The NRDC and its allies are seeking to protect the standards.

""With a stroke of the pen, the EPA is making a mockery of the Trump administration's promise to deliver clean water for Americans,"" said Erik Olson, senior strategic director of health at NRDC.""... But now the administration is going to toss out most of these long-sought protections and allow this contamination to continue unabated all at the behest of the chemical industry and water utilities. With this action, the EPA is making clear that it's willing to ignore Americans who just want to turn on their kitchen taps and have clean, safe water.""

The EPA's latest action came less than three weeks after Zeldin outlined upcoming EPA action to address PFAS. This included in part the designation of an agency lead for PFAS, the creation of effluent limitations guidelines for certain PFAS to stop the forever chemicals from entering drinking water systems, and initiatives with Congress and industry to establish a liability framework ""that ensures the polluter pays and passive receivers are protected.""",https://s3-prod.rubbernews.com/s3fs-public/styles/1200x630/public/Water%20Supply-EPA_i.jpg,N,,2025-05-30 22:03:49.725445

The Associated Press

Energy Secretary Chris Wright said Friday he canceled nearly $4 billion in project grants, in another massive blow to clean energy and greenhouse gas emissions reduction efforts in the U.S. under President Donald Trump’s administration.

The grants, largely awarded during former President Joe Biden’s final few months in the White House, were primarily for programs to capture carbon emissions and store them underground. Other targeted efforts span cleaner cement, natural gas and more.

Some of the 24 canceled awards include $500 million to Heidelberg Materials US, Inc.; $375 million to Eastman Chemical Company; $95 million to Nevada Gold Mines, LLC; and $270 million to Sutter CCUS, among others, according to a list provided by the Department of Energy. Sublime Systems, which lost an $87 million grant, was “surprised and disappointed,” the company said in a statement.

“Today’s action is bad for U.S. competitiveness in the global market and also directly contradictory to the administration’s stated goals of supporting energy production and environmental innovation,” said Conrad Schneider, a senior director at the Clean Air Task Force. It “undercuts U.S. competitiveness at a time when there is a growing global market for cleaner industrial products and technologies.”

The news was a swift follow-up to plans the Energy Department announced earlier this month to review 179 funded projects, totaling over $15 billion, that were awarded by the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations created under the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law.

It is part of Wright’s pledge to ensure “responsible” spending — aligning with the government’s broader efficiency and cost-cutting measures, such as those recommended by the Department of Government Efficiency, which has significantly impacted federal research, workers and agencies.

“While the previous administration failed to conduct a thorough financial review before signing away billions of taxpayer dollars, the Trump administration is doing our due diligence to ensure we are utilizing taxpayer dollars to strengthen our national security, bolster affordable, reliable energy sources and advance projects that generate the highest possible return on investment,” Wright said in Friday’s statement.

Moreover, the announcement marks the latest of the administration’s attacks on clean energy, broadly, and its effort to slash federal support for projects addressing climate change.

The Trump administration has taken an ax to Biden-era environmental ambitions, rolled back landmark regulations, withdrawn climate project funding, and instead bolstered support for oil and gas production in the name of an “American energy dominance” agenda.

Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, called the news “shortsighted.”

Carbon capture has been a controversial climate solution, as skeptics say it enables the continued burning of fossil fuels oil, coal and natural gas that emit planet-warming greenhouse gases — including carbon dioxide — and distracts from the need to cut ties with those energy sources altogether. Though investment in the technology has grown, it also remains challenging to scale.

Industry decries the news

Organizations quickly decried the secretary’s actions, stressing that the cancelations don’t align with the administration’s goals to bolster domestic manufacturing or energy independence.

Jessie Stolark, the executive director of the nonpartisan Carbon Capture Coalition, said the news “is a major step backward” for carbon management technologies, which are “crucial to meeting America’s growing demand for affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy.”

“These projects are not just reducing pollution, they are keeping the U.S. on the cutting edge of manufacturing technology,” said Mike Williams, senior fellow on the energy and environment team at public policy and advocacy group the Center for American Progress. “Canceling these important projects will raise energy prices for consumers and sacrifice thousands of high-quality union jobs, all because the president wants to curry favor with Big Oil.”

Evan Gillespie, partner at decarbonization organization, Industrious Labs, said the move dismantles the economy and the future of American manufacturing and its workforce.

The 126-page complaint argues that the federal directives threaten the plaintiffs’ health and wellbeing by accelerating harms from the fossil fuel industry and climate change.
Fossil fuel pollution has created this emergency—a dangerous situation for Plaintiffs requiring immediate action,” the suit states.
In a statement, Deputy White House press secretary Harrison Fields said the executive orders are part of President Donald Trump’s efforts to protect Americans.
The suit also mentions the executive orders’ effect on decreasing career opportunities for some plaintiffs, through canceled climate science research and study programs.","Twenty-two young plaintiffs, led by a contingent of Montanans who earned a landmark victory in the constitutional climate change lawsuit Held v. Montana, filed suit in U.S. District Court on Thursday against the federal government over a series of climate and energy policies.

The plaintiffs in the lawsuit, Lighthiser v. Trump, argue three of Trump’s executive orders issued earlier this year to “unleash” the fossil fuel industry and remove climate protections threaten their constitutional rights to life and liberty.

“President Trump’s EOs falsely claim an energy emergency, while the true emergency is that fossil fuel pollution is destroying the foundation of Plaintiffs’ lives,” the lawsuit states. “These unconstitutional directives have the immediate effect of slowing the buildout of U.S. energy infrastructure that eliminates planet-heating fossil fuel greenhouse gas pollution … and increasing the use of fossil fuels that pollute the air, water, lands, and climate on which Plaintiffs’ lives depend.”

The lead plaintiff, 19-year-old Eva Lighthiser, from Livingston, is one of several Montana plaintiffs who also filed the landmark Held case, which prevailed in Montana District Court and, in late 2024, in the Montana Supreme Court. Lighthiser is joined in the suit by Rikki Held, Lander and Badge Busse — sons of former Democratic gubernatorial candidate Ryan Busse — and five others from the Montana lawsuit, as well as young people from Hawai‘i, Oregon, California, and Florida.

Plaintiffs from Hawai’i were also involved in a successful youth-led climate lawsuit against the state’s Department of Transportation.

During a seven-day bench trial before Lewis and Clark District Court Judge Kathy Seeley in 2023, Held and 15 youth plaintiffs were found to have a right to a stable climate system under Montana’s constitutional right to a “clean and healthful environment.”

The Held decision, affirmed by the state Supreme Court in December, is mentioned numerous times in the Lighthiser case, and several of the same law firms are representing the plaintiffs in the new suit.

Eleven federal agencies and their respective agency heads, including the Department of Energy, Department of Transportation, Environmental Protection Agency, and NASA, are named as defendants along with the president.

Three of Trump’s executive orders — 14156, 14154 and 14261 — declare a “national energy emergency” and direct numerous federal agencies to “unleash American energy” by accelerating oil, gas and coal production on federal lands, and bolster fossil fuel development. They also roll back funding that bolstered climate protections, including through the Inflation Reduction Act. Various clean energy grant programs, including wind, solar battery storage and electric vehicles, were also targeted in the orders.

The 126-page complaint argues that the federal directives threaten the plaintiffs’ health and wellbeing by accelerating harms from the fossil fuel industry and climate change.

“Plaintiffs were born into and now live in a destabilized climate system. Fossil fuel pollution has created this emergency—a dangerous situation for Plaintiffs requiring immediate action,” the suit states. “… EPA reports that climate change effects, including heat, displacement, financial or food insecurity, loss of recreation, loss of sleep, and risk of PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder), harm children’s health.”

The plaintiffs are asking for the court to find the three executive orders “and any implementing executive actions” unlawful, unconstitutional and invalid, and seek a permanent injunction against implementing and enforcing the orders.

In a statement, Deputy White House press secretary Harrison Fields said the executive orders are part of President Donald Trump’s efforts to protect Americans.

“Promoting domestic energy production is crucial for shielding American families from price volatility and securing a stable energy supply for our nation and its allies. The President has a proven history of bolstering American energy production and will restore our nation’s position as a global energy leader,” Fields said in a statement.

A representative for the Department of Justice declined to comment.

In a press release about the lawsuit, Lighthiser said Trump’s executive orders amount to a “death sentence for my generation.”

“I’m not suing because I want to — I’m suing because I have to. My health, my future, and my right to speak the truth are all on the line. He’s waging war on us with fossil fuels as his weapon, and we’re fighting back with the Constitution.”

In the suit, the plaintiffs list harms experienced in their young lives related to climate change, including from longer wildfire seasons that affect their health, increasingly extreme weather patterns that affect their livelihoods, and changes to their local environments and cultural homes. The suit also mentions the executive orders’ effect on decreasing career opportunities for some plaintiffs, through canceled climate science research and study programs.

The complaint also condemns the federal government’s directives to implement the executive orders by “a wholesale scrubbing, suppression and dismantling of government agencies’ climate science, thereby blinding the government,” and argues that the President exceeded his constitutional and statutory authority— “acting ultra vires” — in issuing the executive orders.

The youth are represented by Our Children’s Trust, an Oregon-based law firm, along with Gregory Law Group, McGarvey Law in Kalispell, and Public Justice.

The people least responsible for climate change, the pope pointed out, are bearing the greatest burdens because of it.
Stifling progress now, Mr. Misleh warns, threatens to exacerbate existing climate difficulties, particularly in the form of extreme weather events.
In the end, this will cost lives, especially in the places least able to build an infrastructure to mitigate the effects of climate change.
But the encyclical succeeded in tying the science together with a moral call to address the social inequities created by climate change.","“Laudato Si’,” which celebrated its 10th anniversary on May 24, will surely stand among the most important components of Pope Francis’ legacy. The encyclical neatly laid out the church’s concerns regarding care of creation, the impact of climate change, and the moral obligations of wealthier societies and individuals in countering the social and spiritual ills of overconsumption. The people least responsible for climate change, the pope pointed out, are bearing the greatest burdens because of it.

There are some signs of progress in addressing the questions raised in “Laudato Si’.” There are also intimations of backpedaling, particularly by the Trump administration, which has joined a small chorus of deniers regarding the industrialized world’s malign effects on creation.

President Donald Trump’s efforts to reverse U.S. progress on sustainable energy, electric vehicle adoption and addressing the worst consequences of climate change began on the night of his inauguration, when he signed a flurry of executive orders on energy and environmental policy. He declared a dubious “national energy emergency,” ordered the withdrawal of the United States from the Paris climate agreement, and set a new policy that aims to maximize fossil fuel production in Alaska and encourage energy production on federal lands.

He rolled back Biden-era emissions standards and blocked new wind energy production. And his retrograde attention to the environment has continued apace. The president has vowed to end tax credits for electric vehicles and terminate a program meant to construct more charging stations for electric cars across the country.

The president’s efforts risk far more than reputational harm to the United States, says Dan Misleh, the executive director of Catholic Climate Covenant. Stifling progress now, Mr. Misleh warns, threatens to exacerbate existing climate difficulties, particularly in the form of extreme weather events. In the end, this will cost lives, especially in the places least able to build an infrastructure to mitigate the effects of climate change.

“It’s just heartless and it’s cruel because they’re now extending the period of climate catastrophe by probably decades.” But no one should be surprised, Mr. Misleh suggests. “If the administration can just wholesale cut [the U.S. Agency for International Development] and [in doing so] condemn millions of people to death, [it] can also pull back on the protections that we should be benefiting from—clean air, clean water, healthy land, healthy food, all of those things are now subject to the slash-and-burn tactics of this administration.”

The “Laudato Si’” Effect

Mr. Misleh recalls with fondness the “heady” days when “Laudato Si’” was first published. The pope already had been enjoying worldwide popularity because of his pastoral style and attention to the plight of global migrants. “And then he writes an encyclical on the environment, which with a name like Francis, I guess was to be expected.”

Ecological advocates in both the secular and ecclesial worlds were quickly singing the encyclical’s praises. “People were saying, ‘This is the most important document ever written on the environment,’ those kinds of superlatives. It really came out with a punch.”

The encyclical surely made Mr. Misleh’s job easier. Since its publication, “Laudato Si’” has been a prime mover in the expansion of church-based national and international efforts focused on addressing climate change and care of creation, including Catholic Climate Covenant, founded by Mr. Misleh. “We’ve relied heavily in the last 10 years on ‘Laudato Si’,’ not only as an excellent teaching document, but to motivate people to become engaged in the issue,” he says.

Covenant-sponsored, parish-based “creation care” teams “didn’t even exist when ‘Laudato Si’’ came out.” Now more than 400 of them work through the national campaign, and 35 have been established at the diocesan level, he reports.

“We’ve put a lot of time and resources into developing our youth and young adult programming, which is going very well,” Mr. Misleh says. “Young people are really happy to see that their church is engaged in these issues.” And a spinoff consultancy to develop sustainable energy infrastructure at Catholic churches and other sites, Catholic Energies, has been engaged for more than 30 projects in 14 states and in Puerto Rico.

Before “Laudato Si’” was published, Catholic environmental advocates had plenty of data and scientific reports about the dangers of climate change and the acute need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. But the encyclical succeeded in tying the science together with a moral call to address the social inequities created by climate change.

The pope taught that “we don’t have a social problem and an environmental problem. We have a problem that’s both social and environmental,” Mr. Misleh says.

“Laudato Si’” first promoted the pope’s notion of integral ecology and integral economics, identifying the self-inflicted spiritual and material wounds of affluence at the heart of the crisis. Francis, Mr. Misleh says, “connected it all together—those three relationships that all need attention: our relationship with God, with each other and with the planet,” and taught that “when any one of those was not tended to, the others suffer.”

That insight has been a key part of the success of “Laudato Si’” as a teaching document, framing the environmental crisis as synonymous with social and spiritual crises, and prescribing a response “not as an add-on [but] central to the practice of our faith.” Francis began using terms that became central themes of his papacy, Mr. Misleh adds, admonishing a “throwaway culture” and the “globalization of indifference.”

Clean energy, an unstoppable force?

There has been notable progress since the publication of “Laudato Si’” as a transition to renewable energy has been accelerating around the world.

And while the United States now leads the world in oil and natural gas production, the World Resources Institute reports that renewable energy “vastly outpaced other generation sources and collectively accounted for around 90% of the United States’ new installed capacity in 2024.” The report continues: “With the new projects online, renewables (including wind, solar, geothermal and hydropower) and battery storage now make up 30% of the country’s large-scale power generating capacity. In 2024, all carbon free electricity sources, including nuclear, supplied nearly 44% of electricity, while renewables, including small-scale solar, supplied nearly 25%.”

Though the rate of adoption of battery electric-powered vehicles has slowed, and new administration policy directly targets the continued expansion of the electric vehicle market, in 2024 a record-breaking 1.3 million electric vehicles were sold in the United States, about 9 percent of all new cars sold.

Mr. Misleh appreciates that progress but worries that much more needs to be accomplished. “Emissions have flattened, that’s for sure, but they’re not going down,” he says. “‘Flattened’ is not good enough. We need to continue to try to reduce our emissions, simplify our lifestyles, embrace not just the technology, but the disposition that we need to take care of this planet for future generations.”

People are more aware of the importance of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, he says, to prevent what climatologists predict would be catastrophic 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) warming above pre-industrial levels by 2050. (A new analysis reports that the 1.5-degree threshold has already been breached.)

If spiritual and scientific evidence is not enough to raise public awareness, contemporary market forces are likely getting people’s attention, according to Mr. Misleh. “People are realizing that to put solar [panels or shingles] on my home, in many places, is now less expensive than paying for the dirty energy that comes from power plants. That’s why our Catholic Energies program has been successful—because it makes economic sense to do this.”

Sharp increases in homeowners’ insurance because of the increasing threat of fire and flood, he adds, help connect the dots for many individuals between greenhouse gas emission and increasingly common extreme weather events.

“Everybody’s been impacted in some way by climate change, whether they know it or not—these massive floods, these extended droughts, these crazy wildfires that take out thousands of buildings in Los Angeles—all of this,” he says. “People are beginning to wake up and say, ‘Oh, maybe, there is something to this climate crisis after all.’”

That does not seem to be the case in Washington under the new administration, which has taken unprecedented steps to squash new climatological research that would likely support the global scientific consensus on climate change. Mr. Trump seems uniquely, almost vindictively, determined to push back progress already made.

But a report from Columbia Business School suggests market forces and an activist role among state governments, which are more likely to appreciate the positive local impact of the sustainable energy transition, could frustrate the president’s desire to “drill, baby, drill.”

The president has recently frozen clean energy investments that were part of the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act. But that may prove a temporary setback. Researchers at Columbia write that the I.R.A. “is an effective and popular piece of legislation with significant bipartisan support in and out of Congress.”

They add: “Since its passage in 2022, around three-fourths of clean energy investments have been made in Republican states, fueling job creation in regions that have historically depended on oil and gas.”

The clean energy transition, these researchers report, is no longer an artifact of a political or ideological agenda but “an economic reality, with red and blue states alike leveraging federal and state incentives to attract investment and modernize infrastructure.”

In fact, the red state of Texas “has surged ahead of former solar leader California, reaching 27.5 GW of utility-scale capacity in 2024—approximately one-fifth of the country’s total.”

But the substantial progress in Texas has perversely become targeted by the state’s Republican legislators, following the Trump administration’s lead. Texas G.O.P. legislators are pressing new standards that could hamstring wind and solar energy development. In Washington, Lee Zeldin, appointed head of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in March, said the agency’s new mission is to “lower the cost of buying a car, heating a home and running a business,” ignoring the agency’s historic responsibilities to protect public health and the environment.

He quickly repealed scores of significant federal environmental regulations, including limits on industrial and tailpipe pollution and containment of greenhouse gases that are heating the planet, gleefully declaring, “[W]e are driving a dagger straight into the heart of the climate change religion.”

But “it’s not a religion,” Mr. Misleh says, “it’s science.” And it is also big business.

The administration’s proposals will thwart innovation on sustainable energy, battery production and electric vehicles, sacrificing America’s global leadership on these emerging technologies and potentially vast commercial opportunities for U.S. businesses and working people. Other nations will surely step in to fill the void that the administration is creating.

China, the world’s largest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, has over the last half-decade surged ahead on clean energy. It is turning to renewables as it contends with catastrophic air, land and water pollution caused by its historic reliance on coal.

According to a report from the Yale School of the Environment: “Fossil fuels now make up less than half of China’s total installed generation capacity,” and China is on track to reach significant clean energy goals years ahead of schedule.

The United States made similar clean energy pledges during the Biden administration. That appears to be a matter of indifference to Mr. Trump.

“We could be the leaders in this technology globally and make a handy profit on it too,” Mr. Misleh says. Instead, “we’ll be less safe and less secure because other countries will step into this void.”

Countering a revival of denialism

U.S. Catholics concerned about climate change will have to be on their best game in this era of White House denialism.

“Certainly our first order of business is to always pray about this and to try to simplify our lives,” Mr. Misleh says. But “in terms of advocacy, we’re turning our attention to the states.”

“It’s all [playing] defense at the federal level, but at the state level, we’re going to push for more renewable energy portfolio standards and tighter pollution controls.”

That does not mean surrendering the field in Washington. “We need to be loud about the wrong-headedness of this dramatic scaling back of environmental protections,” Mr. Misleh says. “It’s going to impact our children. It’s going to impact low-income people especially.”

In that effort, Mr. Misleh is confident that he can count on the backing not just of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops in Washington but of Francis’ successor in Rome. Pope Leo XIV has “already said a number of things about the environment, linking it to questions of poverty and equity,” Mr. Misled says. “I see him very much following in the footsteps of Pope Francis.

“But all of this teaching goes back not just to Francis,” he quickly adds. “It goes back to Benedict and John Paul II and Paul VI, for that matter. This teaching has become a core part of who we are as Catholics, and I don’t see Pope Leo backtracking on that in the least.”

High-performance polymer materials called lithium-ion battery polyimide (PI) binders are used in battery electrodes to improve mechanical stability, thermal resistance, and chemical durability. During charging-discharge cycles, these binders ensure the structural integrity of electrodes by providing superior adhesion and flexibility. In contrast to conventional PVDF binders, PI binders have exceptional electrochemical stability, which makes them perfect for next-generation high-energy-density batteries. Applications for lithium-ion battery PI binders are used in a variety of industries, including electronics, electric vehicles (EVs), energy storage systems (ESS), and aerospace. The use of PI binders is being driven by the growing need for high-energy-density, long-cycle-life batteries in consumer electronics, electric vehicles (EVs), and energy storage systems (ESS).

Additionally, the demand for advanced battery materials is being driven by the EV sector's rapid growth, which is being driven by strict emission regulations and government incentives. Furthermore, the use of PI binders is being accelerated by safety concerns related to lithium-ion batteries, especially in high-temperature and high-voltage applications. Their superior heat resistance increases battery reliability by lowering the possibility of thermal runaway. As a result of tighter regulations and rising consumer demands for durable, safe batteries, manufacturers are incorporating PI binders to increase overall battery stability.

Additionally, as environmental concerns grow, manufacturers of batteries are concentrating on sustainable materials and production techniques. Global sustainability goals are aligned with PI binders because of their improved recyclability and minimal VOC emissions. In order to support more advanced battery technologies, this trend is driving investigations into environmentally friendly binding methods. However, when compared to conventional binders like PVDF, the cost of producing polyimide binders is high since it requires advanced polymer synthesis. Costly materials and complicated processing requirements restrict its widespread use.

The cuts came amid rising fears over what the future holds for federal clean energy policy and tax credits.
More than 13,000 jobs and over $12 billion in clean energy projects have been canceled so far in Republican districts this year.
Since Congress passed federal tax credits for clean energy in August of 2022, 45 announced projects have been closed, downsized or canceled.
More than $16 billion in investments and 20,000 jobs were associated with the abandoned projects.","More than $14 billion in clean energy projects have been canceled or delayed in the United States since January, according to a new analysis by Environmental Entrepreneurs (E2), a nonprofit clean energy business group.

The 2025 losses have also cost 10,000 new jobs in low-carbon energy and clean vehicle factories, a press release from E2 said.

The cuts came amid rising fears over what the future holds for federal clean energy policy and tax credits. In April, $4.5 billion in new electric vehicle (EV), battery and wind energy projects were canceled by companies in advance of the U.S. House of Representatives’ passage of an enormous tax and spending package — the One Big Beautiful Bill Act — which would essentially do away with clean energy tax credits passed in 2022.

“Now is not the time to raise taxes on clean energy and compound the business uncertainty that is clearly taking a greater and greater toll on U.S. manufacturing and jobs,” said Michael Timberlake, communications director at E2, in the press release.

E2 tracked another $1.5 billion in projects that had been canceled in previous months.

Ahead of the Senate’s consideration of the legislation, the analysis by E2 shows that over 10,000 announced jobs were already canceled amid apprehensions over the bill’s advancement.

“If the tax plan passed by the House last week becomes law, expect to see construction and investments stopping in states across the country as more projects and jobs are canceled. Businesses are now counting on Congress to come to its senses and stop this costly attack on an industry that is essential to meeting America’s growing energy demand and that’s driving unprecedented economic growth in every part of the country,” Timberlake added.

Republican congressional districts have been experiencing the most cancellations despite benefitting the most from the tax credits. More than 13,000 jobs and over $12 billion in clean energy projects have been canceled so far in Republican districts this year.

“The House’s plan coupled with the administration’s focus on stomping out clean energy and returning us to a country powered by coal and gas guzzlers is causing businesses to cancel plans, delay their plans and take their money and jobs to other countries instead,” said Executive Director of E2 Bob Keefe, as The Associated Press reported.

Through April of 2025, more than 61 percent of all announced clean energy projects — as well as 72 percent of jobs and 82 percent of investments — were in Republican congressional districts, the press release said.

Tennessee and Georgia are especially at risk because they have made major investments in the production of EVs and batteries, according to Marilyn Brown, a professor of energy policy at the Georgia Institute of Technology, who did not participate in the analysis, reported The Associated Press.

“If all of a sudden these tax credits are removed, I’m not sure how these ongoing projects are going to continue,” said Fengqi You, a Cornell University engineering professor, who was not involved in the analysis.

In an April letter, some Republican lawmakers told Republican Senate Majority Leader John Thune of South Dakota that a repeal of the tax credits could weaken the U.S. position as a world energy leader.

However, as cancellations rise, businesses are still investing in the country’s clean economy. Companies announced almost $500 million in investments in April for new factories to produce solar, EV, grid and transmission equipment across six states. These include a $400 investment for the expansion of a Michigan solar wafer factory that is predicted to create a minimum of 400 new jobs and a $9.3 million investment from a solar equipment manufacturer in Canada to build a new solar plant in North Carolina.

If completed, the seven projects are expected to create almost 3,000 new permanent jobs.

So the return of Musk to Tesla is something of a mixed blessing.","It is hard to tell how Elon Musk’s whirlwind four months in Washington were anything but bad news for his biggest company, Tesla.

The brand’s sales are falling everywhere, and Americans have increasingly dark views of the electric-car company and its new robotaxi. Musk’s job is to clean up the mess, even though some inside Tesla think he is part of the problem.

Today, President Donald Trump officially saw Musk off with a press conference in the Oval Office. “I want to thank Elon for helping,” Trump said, while Musk made clear he’s not done with Washington — a city where he has left plenty of appointees burrowed into the federal bureaucracy, and where his companies have a lot of regulatory and contracting business to conduct. “I’ll continue to be visiting here,” he said.

Musk’s track record as a government cost-cutter is up for debate. His bold pledges of cutting $2 trillion from the federal budget when he started the Department of Government Efficiency have shrunk to about $150 billion, and even that is contested. And he has said he worries that the House version of the GOP megabill will erase any gains that DOGE made.

And now the Tesla CEO returns to an automaker in a sales and reputational crisis.

Sales are down in China, whose home-grown automakers spin out EVs that are cheaper and, to some, more exciting than Tesla’s. Sales are cratering in Europe, where car buyers are enticed by a growing roster of EVs — including China’s — and turned off by Musk’s embrace of far-right figures.

And in Tesla’s home U.S. market, there’s abundant evidence that Musk has vaporized the company’s goodwill. It turns out that being the strident face of mass government layoffs isn’t a great look when many of your company’s customers were drawn to the Musk who made gasoline-free transportation cool.

Reviving Tesla

A survey in early May asked more than 8,000 Americans what they thought of EV automakers. The poll by the Electric Vehicle Intelligence Report found that Tesla’s reputation was the worst across every demographic, and 38 percent said their views had darkened over the past six months.

Musk intends to work his way out of this bind by focusing on Tesla’s new and disruptive projects: the Optimus robot and the robotaxi, which Musk just confirmed will take to the streets of Austin in June. There too, Tesla faces headwinds.

Meanwhile, moves that Congress made last week could collectively slash Tesla’s profits and make it harder for Detroit automakers and smaller EV competitors like Rivian to succeed. The House’s version of the Republican megabill would eliminate incentives to buy and make EVs, while the Senate voted to kill California’s Environmental Protection Agency waiver that allowed the state to require high EV sales.

The end of that waiver — combined with Trump’s watering down of emissions standards — will eliminate credits that Tesla could have earned by selling them to other automakers. Federal and state regulatory credits have earned Tesla $10.7 billion over a decade.

So the return of Musk to Tesla is something of a mixed blessing. On the plus side: Dan Ives, a financial analyst for Wedbush Securities, called Musk’s new focus “music to the ears of Tesla shareholders.”

Now Tesla’s chief has to show he can change the narrative.

Today in POLITICO Energy’s podcast: Alex Guillén breaks down a Supreme Court ruling that says federal agencies can conduct narrow environmental review for energy projects and how that could affect legal challenges to Donald Trump’s anti-regulatory agenda.

Power Centers

Backdoor bid to slash regulation

The Environmental Protection Agency’s upcoming proposal to undo Biden-era limits on power plants’ greenhouse gas emissions is expected to argue that the U.S. electricity sector doesn’t contribute “significantly” to climate change.

If EPA’s argument survives legal challenges, it could offer cover for the agency to stop regulating planet-warming emissions from a wide range of sources under the Clean Air Act, Jean Chemnick reports.

Cycle of litigation

Trump’s energy emergency declaration has offered help to oil, gas and coal companies trying to get federal permits faster and, therefore, build faster. But Trump’s moves could backfire, leaving projects tied up in court for years, Mike Soraghan reports.

The reality is that Congress hasn’t repealed the environmental laws that guide permitting and environmental analysis. And though a Thursday ruling by the Supreme Court limited the scope of environmental reviews, agencies will still be required to thoroughly examine the direct effects of energy projects.

Europe’s 2040 goal

The European Commission’s 2040 climate target is expected on July 2. EU Climate Commissioner Wopke Hoekstra said this week that the EU executive would propose a 90 percent target for cutting emissions.

The plan builds in flexibility for individual countries. For instance, countries could meet their goals through the use of international carbon credits tied to overseas projects, Zia Weise reports.

In Other News

Costs piling up: Many of Trump’s regulatory reversals will pile more costs onto individual Americans in the form of higher bank fees and electricity and water bills.

Cutting rigs: U.S. drillers cut the number of oil and natural gas rigs operating for a fifth week in a row to the lowest since November 2021, according to Baker Hughes.

two businesses in Alabama.

American Cast Iron Pipe Company and United States Pipe and Foundry Company, LLC were both set to receive $75 million in grant money from the Department of Energy but will no longer receive the funding in light of the grants getting canceled.

“While the previous administration failed to conduct a thorough financial review before signing away billions of taxpayer dollars, the Trump administration is doing our due diligence to ensure we are utilizing taxpayer dollars to strengthen our national security, bolster affordable, reliable energy sources and advance projects that generate the highest possible return on investment,” said U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright said in a DOE press release. “Today, we are acting in the best interest of the American people by cancelling these 24 awards.”

A message was left with both companies Friday seeking comment.

According to a press release, American Cast Iron Pipe Company made it to the negotiation stage of the awards process and was planning to use the funding to replace single cupola furnaces with four coreless induction furnaces. This would have reduced the facility’s CO2 emissions by an estimated 62% and the melting/holding process CO2 emissions by 95%.

The U.S. Pipe and Foundry Company said in a press release that they planned to use the money for Phase 1 of U.S. Pipe’s Iron Electric Induction Conversion project. The project involved replacing a coke-fired furnace with electric induction melting furnaces and would have resulted in an “estimated 73% reduction in carbon intensity at the Alabama Works ductile iron pipe production facility.”

Of the 24 awards given, nearly 70% were signed between Election Day last year and Jan. 20. By cancelling the awards, the Department of Energy is generating $3.6 billion in savings for Americans.

The DOE said the awards have been terminated because they “failed to advance the energy needs of the American people, were not economically viable and would not generate a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-47657/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/birmingham-alabama-1024x6801748640362.jpg?h=50844e28&itok=mPgST9rm,N,,2025-05-30 19:08:49.918214

Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, who chairs the EPA funding panel, knocked the Trump administration this month for “indiscriminate” funding freezes, an “unserious” budget request and “massive” reorganizations within agency.

Expanding upon the so-called skinny budget the White House transmitted to Capitol Hill earlier this month, the new documents detail the White House’s ambitions for spending cuts across government agencies. They show which accounts the president wants GOP lawmakers to target as Trump seeks non-defense funding cuts of more than 22 percent in the upcoming fiscal year and a flat military budget.

Besides the White House’s release Friday of a more than 1,200-page appendix to Trump’s May 2 budget request, individual agencies also posted their own “budget in brief” documents. Among the proposed cuts to most federal departments, the administration is asking Congress to slash $12 billion from federal education programs, $5 billion from agriculture efforts and a total of more than $60 billion from health, housing and community development work.

Senior GOP members of both the House and Senate have already scorned Trump’s initial budget request, heightening the conflict between Republicans on Capitol Hill and those in the Trump administration as Congress races to head off a government shutdown in four months.

Many of the budget documents the Trump administration posted Friday were full of zeros. The Education Department’s brief, for example, contains entire pages of programs the Trump administration wants to eliminate, including federal grants that support preschools, education services for homeless children and those living in rural areas.

The Environmental Protection Agency is asking Congress to eliminate funding for dozens of grant programs, including those that support the enforcement of pesticide rules, pollution control and restrictions on toxic substances.

On Capitol Hill, top Republican appropriators have said they won’t cut the EPA as deeply as Trump wants. Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, who chairs the EPA funding panel, knocked the Trump administration this month for “indiscriminate” funding freezes, an “unserious” budget request and “massive” reorganizations within agency.

Just how deeply congressional Republicans are willing to slice into federal programs will start to become clear next week, when House GOP appropriators plan to debut the first of a dozen annual funding bills. That includes the measure that covers agriculture programs and the Food and Drug Administration, and the bill that funds initiatives supporting military construction and veterans.

The White House has not threatened to veto funding bills that exceed, or depart sharply from, the president’s request. But Trump’s budget chief has said the administration hasn’t ruled out continuing to use “impoundment” to withhold congressionally approved funding the administration doesn’t want to spend.

“Impoundment is still on the table and something we will consider,” White House budget director Russ Vought said this week on Fox Business, repeating what he said earlier this month at the time of the skinny budget’s initial release.

That threat has irked Republican lawmakers who argue that the tactic is illegal under the 51-year-old law created to prevent presidents from undermining the “power of the purse” Congress is granted under the Constitution.

Whatever government funding legislation makes it to Trump’s desk in the fall will first need the support of several Democrats in the Senate, where Minority Leader Chuck Schumer is under pressure to hold the line against drastic cuts after caving in March to help advance the stopgap bill Republicans unilaterally crafted after abandoning bipartisan negotiations.

Attracting Democratic support in the Senate is likely to require higher funding levels, which could prompt Republican opposition across Capitol, House Appropriations Chair Tom Cole acknowledged this month.

“Anything they do to get Democratic support in the Senate — which they have to do under their own rules — will almost certainly cost me Republican support over here,” said the Oklahoma Republican.

That was not the case earlier this year when House GOP leaders mustered near-unanimous GOP support in their chamber to pass a funding patch through September. However, several House Republicans have already warned they won’t back another stopgap this fall, insisting instead on enactment of full-year appropriations bills. Lawmakers in both parties also want to pass updated funding levels, while locking in earmarks to ensure federal cash flows to specific projects in their districts.

“I don’t want to do it again,” Cole told reporters this month about the prospect of another short-term funding measure. “I want to deal.”",https://static.politico.com/3b/04/17cee9994bdfa16530a7facb4e36/u-s-congress-05573.jpg,N,,2025-05-30 19:08:32.620984

The grants, largely awarded during former President Joe Biden’s final few months in the White House, were primarily for programs to capture carbon emissions and store them underground. Other targeted efforts span cleaner cement, natural gas and more.

Some of the 24 canceled awards include $500 million to Heidelberg Materials US, Inc.; $375 million to Eastman Chemical Company; $95 million to Nevada Gold Mines, LLC; and $270 million to Sutter CCUS, among others, according to a list provided by the Department of Energy. Sublime Systems, which lost an $87 million grant, was “surprised and disappointed,” the company said in a statement.

“Today’s action is bad for U.S. competitiveness in the global market and also directly contradictory to the administration’s stated goals of supporting energy production and environmental innovation,” said Conrad Schneider, a senior director at the Clean Air Task Force. It “undercuts U.S. competitiveness at a time when there is a growing global market for cleaner industrial products and technologies.”

The news was a swift follow-up to plans the Energy Department announced earlier this month to review 179 funded projects, totaling over $15 billion, that were awarded by the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations created under the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law.

It is part of Wright’s pledge to ensure “responsible” spending — aligning with the government’s broader efficiency and cost-cutting measures, such as those recommended by the Department of Government Efficiency, which has significantly impacted federal research, workers and agencies.

“While the previous administration failed to conduct a thorough financial review before signing away billions of taxpayer dollars, the Trump administration is doing our due diligence to ensure we are utilizing taxpayer dollars to strengthen our national security, bolster affordable, reliable energy sources and advance projects that generate the highest possible return on investment,” Wright said in Friday’s statement.

Moreover, the announcement marks the latest of the administration’s attacks on clean energy, broadly, and its effort to slash federal support for projects addressing climate change.

The Trump administration has taken an ax to Biden-era environmental ambitions, rolled back landmark regulations, withdrawn climate project funding, and instead bolstered support for oil and gas production in the name of an “American energy dominance” agenda.

Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, called the news “shortsighted.”

Carbon capture has been a controversial climate solution, as skeptics say it enables the continued burning of fossil fuels oil, coal and natural gas that emit planet-warming greenhouse gases — including carbon dioxide — and distracts from the need to cut ties with those energy sources altogether. Though investment in the technology has grown, it also remains challenging to scale.

Industry decries the news

Organizations quickly decried the secretary’s actions, stressing that the cancelations don’t align with the administration’s goals to bolster domestic manufacturing or energy independence.

Jessie Stolark, the executive director of the nonpartisan Carbon Capture Coalition, said the news “is a major step backward” for carbon management technologies, which are “crucial to meeting America’s growing demand for affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy.”

“These projects are not just reducing pollution, they are keeping the U.S. on the cutting edge of manufacturing technology,” said Mike Williams, senior fellow on the energy and environment team at public policy and advocacy group the Center for American Progress. “Canceling these important projects will raise energy prices for consumers and sacrifice thousands of high-quality union jobs, all because the president wants to curry favor with Big Oil.”

Evan Gillespie, partner at decarbonization organization, Industrious Labs, said the move dismantles the economy and the future of American manufacturing and its workforce.

“Killing these projects means more emissions, more pollution, and more people getting sick,” he said.

Texas is home to two nuclear power plants, but both are aging.
The Comanche Peak Nuclear Power Plant's first phase was completed in 1990 after several delays and setbacks since construction began in 1974.
The South Texas Project in Matagorda County, about 90 miles south of Houston, began operations in 1988.
As of last year, there were 54 commercially operating nuclear power plants with 94 nuclear power reactors in 28 states, according to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.","A sweeping proposal to provide up to $350 million to private companies to help them build advanced nuclear power generation plants in Texas is one step away from reaching Gov. Greg Abbott's desk after the House author said Thursday that he expects the chamber to accept tweaks made by the Senate.

""Yessir,"" state Rep. Cody Harris, R-Palestine, told the American-Statesman in a text message response to a question about whether he'll recommend sending the Senate's version of the bill to the governor. Abbott signaled early in the legislative session that he looks forward to signing such a measure into law.

House Bill 14, by Harris and sponsored in the Senate by Georgetown Republican Sen. Charles Schwertner, would establish the Texas Advanced Nuclear Energy Office and the Advanced Nuclear Development Fund under the governor's office. The new agency and funding arm would assess the need for additional nuclear generation or explore ways to promote future plant construction.

The bill sets up guidelines and benchmarks for companies planning to develop nuclear plants to help meet Texas' seemingly insatiable appetite for electric power, and it makes available public financial assistance for both planning and constructing power plants.

""Advancements in nuclear energy offer a promising opportunity to strengthen our electric grid with reliable, dispatchable generation while supporting the growth of this innovative industry,"" Schwertner said as he explained the Senate version of HB 14.

Both chambers passed the bill with bipartisan support, though there was some skepticism expressed about the funding provisions.

Grants vs. loan to promote nuclear development

""Would it not make more sense to maybe do a revolving loan so that they (power companies) would pay them back and we could re-enter and save more money into the system and encourage more nuclear development?"" state Sen. Jose Menendez, D-San Antonio, asked Schwertner.

The proposed grant system would be a more persuasive tool, Schwertner responded. Plus, he added, the legislation contains payback provisions if companies do not deliver what they promised.

""They do have risk,"" he said.

Under HB 14, the state Public Utility Commission will develop a framework to tie grant amounts to the amount of electric generation a project would produce.

Why Abbott wants a 'nuclear renaissance'

In his State of the State address shortly after the Legislature convened in January, Abbott called for a ""nuclear renaissance"" in Texas to ensure that the rapidly growing state can meet the demand for power that comes with not only adding to its population, but also attracting more commercial and industrial development.

Texas is home to two nuclear power plants, but both are aging. The Comanche Peak Nuclear Power Plant's first phase was completed in 1990 after several delays and setbacks since construction began in 1974. The second phase of the plant, which is about 60 miles southwest of Fort Worth, went online in 1993.

The South Texas Project in Matagorda County, about 90 miles south of Houston, began operations in 1988.

As of last year, there were 54 commercially operating nuclear power plants with 94 nuclear power reactors in 28 states, according to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Illinois has 11 reactors, the most of any state. The nation's largest nuclear power source, the Alvin W. Vogtle Electric Generating Plant in Georgia, has four reactors. The average age of all U.S. nuclear plants is around 42.

What nuclear power projects are pending in Texas?

Reed Clay, president of the Texas Nuclear Alliance, called the legislation ""a giant leap forward for our state and our country."" He predicted it would revive an industry that ""was all but dead for decades.""

""With the passage of H.B. 14 and associated legislation, Texas is positioned to lead a nuclear renaissance that is now rightly seen as imperative for the energy security and national security of the United States,"" Clay said in a statement to the Statesman.

Meanwhile, Texas A&M University's research-focused RELLIS campus near the system's flagship institution is working to develop a nuclear generation project just a fraction of the size of traditional nuclear plants like those in Comanche Peak, and the South Texas Project. The university's permit is awaiting approval from the NRC. Also, Natura Resources is seeking federal approval for a nuclear plant in Abilene.

The first small modular reactor in Texas will be located on Dow's Seadrift plant just north of San Antonio Bay near Victoria. Dow is partnering with the company X-energy on the project that was bolstered by an initial $80 million grant from the U.S. Energy Department. The formal permit application was filed with the NRC in March.","https://www.statesman.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/05/29/NAAS/83926071007-20250523-t-125100-z-2023065423-rc-2-alaaa-1-ie-1-rtrmadp-3-usastocksnuclearstocks.JPG?crop=5544,3119,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-05-30 18:08:31.313484

Pet policy provisions that House Republicans tucked into the megabill could get ruled out by the Senate parliamentarian for not meeting the Byrd Rule — the requirement that components of a reconciliation package have budgetary impacts.","By Lisa Kashinsky, Mia McCarthy and Ben Leonard

Chuck Schumer tells us Democrats have a ripe new target in their fight against the megabill: leveraging Republican infighting over whether to eviscerate clean-energy credits.

In an exclusive interview with Lisa Thursday, the Senate minority leader said his caucus is looking to make it politically untenable for Majority Leader John Thune and his members to follow House Republicans in gutting green credits under the Biden-era climate law. Those credits, Schumer points out, have widely benefited red states.

Schumer’s game plan: Needle Republicans already wary of job and investment losses back home to compel Thune to skip the drastic cuts that House GOP leaders included to bring hard-liners along.

How Senate Democrats will do it: Ramp up the public pressure campaign Schumer kick-started Thursday against the backdrop of a rooftop solar field in Manhattan, and force Republicans to take tough votes through eventual vote-a-rama amendments.

“There are a whole number of Republicans, particularly those that have a lot of clean-energy investments in their states, who really didn’t like what the House did,” Schumer told Lisa. “And the question is: Will they be able to put enough pressure on Thune, or even vote [with us] on some amendments?”

Why Schumer sees this as a fruitful avenue for attack: A quartet of GOP senators — Lisa Murkowski, Thom Tillis, John Curtis and Jerry Moran — warned their leadership weeks ago against a “full-scale repeal of current credits.” Tillis has already raised concerns about the House language. Schumer said he’s spoken privately to “a good number of Republican colleagues” who dislike the House’s cuts, but declined to name names.

“The irony here is most of the new solar, wind and battery factories are in red states. And so we want to make it clear … [the rollbacks] are going to be huge problems in their states,” Schumer said.

Democrats may have an unlikely ally in this fight. Elon Musk’s Tesla on Thursday blasted plans to phase out the clean-energy tax credits and terminate most credits for electric vehicles at the end of the year, arguing it would “threaten America’s energy independence and the reliability of our grid.”

But Republicans have a more pressing challenge awaiting in the Senate. Pet policy provisions that House Republicans tucked into the megabill could get ruled out by the Senate parliamentarian for not meeting the Byrd Rule — the requirement that components of a reconciliation package have budgetary impacts. And they could get cut in what’s known as a “Byrd Bath.”

The seven “Byrd droppings” to keep an eye on, per our Jordain Carney this morning: tax-cut accounting, AI regulations, judicial powers, gun regulations, farm bill provisions, Planned Parenthood funds and energy permitting.

Julie Leon, 65, was found unresponsive in her car on June 28, 2021 — the hottest day in Seattle's history. The temperature in the city that day peaked at 108 degrees Fahrenheit. By the time Leon died of hyperthermia, her internal temperature had risen to 110 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the lawsuit filed Thursday in King County Superior Court.

The suit names six oil companies, including ExxonMobil, BP and Chevron, that have allegedly known for decades that burning fossil fuels alters the Earth's atmosphere, resulting in more extreme weather and the ""foreseeable loss of human life."" But rather than warn the public, the suit says the oil companies deceived consumers about the risks.

""Defendants have known for all of Julie's life that their affirmative misrepresentations and omissions would claim lives,"" the lawsuit says. ""Julie is a victim of Defendants' conduct.""

In a rapid attribution study released days after the event, a team of scientists said the 2021 heatwave in the Pacific Northwest would have been ""virtually impossible without human-caused climate change.""

A lawyer for Chevron, Theodore Boutrous, criticized the lawsuit. ""Exploiting a personal tragedy to promote politicized climate tort litigation is contrary to law, science, and common sense,"" Boutrous said in a statement to NPR. ""The court should add this far-fetched claim to the growing list of meritless climate lawsuits that state and federal courts have already dismissed.""

Representatives of Shell, ConocoPhillips, BP and Phillips 66 declined to comment. A spokesperson for ExxonMobil said a comment from the company wasn't immediately available.

Julie Leon's daughter, Misti Leon, who filed the wrongful death lawsuit in Washington state, wants the oil companies to pay damages in amounts that would be determined at trial. Misti Leon is also trying to force the oil companies to conduct a public education campaign to correct ""decades of misinformation.""

Fossil fuel companies already face dozens of other climate lawsuits filed by states and localities for allegedly misleading the public for decades about the dangers of burning fossil fuels, the primary cause of climate change. Those lawsuits seek money to help communities cope with the risks and damages from global warming, including more extreme storms, floods and heat waves. The American Petroleum Institute, an industry group, has said repeatedly that the lawsuits are meritless and that climate change is an issue that should be dealt with by Congress, not the courts.

Those kinds of lawsuits have had mixed results. A Pennsylvania judge recently dismissed a climate lawsuit that Bucks County filed against several oil companies. Court of Common Pleas Judge Stephen Corr said the lawsuit was beyond the scope of state law. Since it was primarily about greenhouse gas emissions, he said it was a matter for the federal government to deal with under the Clean Air Act. Judge Corr noted that other courts have dismissed similar lawsuits by cities and states, including New Jersey and Baltimore.

Boutrous, Chevron's lawyer in the Pennsylvania case, told WHYY that climate change is a ""policy issue that needs statewide, nationwide and global cooperation to resolve. These state lawsuits just don't really do anything other than clog the courts.""

Other cases, though, are moving forward. In January, the Supreme Court rejected an effort by oil and gas companies to block a climate lawsuit filed by Honolulu, and in March the justices turned down a request by Republican attorneys general to try to stop climate lawsuits filed by states including California, Connecticut, Minnesota and Rhode Island. The American Petroleum Institute said in statements to NPR at the time that it was disappointed by the Supreme Court's decisions, saying the lawsuits are a ""distraction"" and ""waste of taxpayer resources.""

However, the issue has caught the attention of the Trump administration. On May 1, the Justice Department sued Michigan and Hawaii to try to stop those states from filing climate lawsuits against the fossil fuel industry.

Douglas Kysar, faculty director of the Law, Environment and Animals Program at Yale Law School, said Leon's lawsuit stands out from other climate cases that are working their way through the courts.

""The advantage of this lawsuit is that it puts an individual human face on the massive harmful consequences of collective climate inaction,"" Kysar said in an email to NPR. ""Not only that, the complaint tells a story of industry betrayal of public trust through the eyes of a particular person.""

On Wednesday, Talon Metals Corp. signed a land-use agreement to build a $365 million processing facility at the former Westmoreland Beulah Mine, which closed in 2021.

The Beulah Mineral Processing Facility (BMPF) will handle nickel and copper — vital materials used in electric vehicle batteries, renewable energy systems, stainless steel and military technologies. Construction is expected to begin in 2027, with the aim of supporting national energy independence and revitalizing the local economy.

Talon Metals, a Minnesota-based company, plans to repurpose approximately 256 acres of the former coal mine site, citing the area’s existing infrastructure as a major advantage. The company will transport raw materials by rail from its proposed Tamarack mine in Minnesota — a joint venture with Rio Tinto — to Beulah via BNSF Railway.

“We have the infrastructure here,” said Beulah Mayor Sean Cheatley. “Everything’s there—they don’t have to do any more ground work. It’s going to bring more jobs to the area and bolster our economy.”

Talon estimates the project will create around 150 full-time jobs, with several hundred more expected during construction.

The BMPF is backed by a $115 million grant from the U.S. Department of Energy, awarded through the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. Talon President Mike Kicis called the federal support “essential” to moving the project forward.

Gov. Kelly Armstrong, who spoke at the announcement ceremony, praised the DOE for supporting North Dakota’s role in critical minerals development — despite having voted against the infrastructure law while serving in the U.S. House.

In a 2021 statement, Armstrong said, “We cannot continue to spend money we don’t have and saddle future generations with the consequences of reckless spending.”

Sens. John Hoeven and Kevin Cramer supported the Senate version of the bill and have voiced strong backing for the project.

“This is a priority project, nationally, in terms of manufacturing critical minerals instead of getting them from places like China and Russia,” Hoeven said. “So, this is a big deal — for the Hazen and Beulah area, for North Dakota and for our country.”

Although the Beulah facility has local support, its viability hinges on approval of the Tamarack mine in Minnesota, currently under environmental review by the state’s Department of Natural Resources.

The proposed mine has drawn opposition from Native American groups and environmental organizations concerned about its impact on wild rice habitats and water sources. Talon spokesperson Jessica Johnson said the company revised its mine design after receiving more than 1,600 public comments, opting for an underground structure with an enclosed entrance to reduce pollution and protect water quality.

“We’re very hopeful that it will go through,” Johnson said. “We’ve put a lot of effort into mine design to address environmental concerns brought to us.”

If the Tamarack mine is not approved, Talon says it is exploring other domestic sources for critical minerals, though Tamarack remains the “primary focus.”

At the Beulah site, Talon plans to use dry stacking — a method of dewatering and compacting mine tailings — to manage waste. Though considered safer than traditional slurry storage, dry stacking can still pose a risk of heavy metal leaching during rain or snowmelt. To address this, the company is researching the use of fly ash from local coal plants to chemically stabilize the tailings.

Johnson likened the stabilizing effect to “taking Tums for an upset stomach.”

Talon is also exploring a “Full Value Mining Scenario” that could include building a byproduct processing facility to extract cobalt, iron and other materials from tailings. This facility might also produce cement alternatives for road construction and carbon storage materials, though no budget or timeline has been set.

If both the BMPF and Tamarack mine are approved, construction on each could begin around the same time in 2027, with operations starting as early as 2028. The Beulah facility would help fulfill Talon’s contract to supply Tesla with 75,000 metric tons of nickel concentrate over six years.

“This is about more than just one plant,” said Johnson. “It’s about building a secure, sustainable supply chain for the technologies that are shaping our future.”

Building an underground tunnel for an aging Enbridge oil pipeline that stretches across a Great Lakes channel could destroy wetlands and harm bat habitats but would eliminate the chances of a boat anchor rupturing the line and causing a catastrophic spill, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers said Friday in a long-awaited draft analysis of the proposed project’s environmental impacts.

The analysis moves the corps a step closer to approving the tunnel for Line 5 in the Straits of Mackinac. The tunnel was proposed in 2018 at a cost of $500 million but has been bogged down by legal challenges. The corps fast-tracked the project in April after President Donald Trump ordered federal agencies in January to identify energy projects for expedited emergency permitting.

A final environmental assessment is expected by autumn, with a permitting decision to follow later this year. The agency initially planned to issue a permitting decision in early 2026.

With that permit in hand, Enbridge would only need permission from the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy before it could begin constructing the tunnel. That’s far from a given, though.

Environmentalists have been pressuring the state to deny the permit. Meanwhile, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel and Gov. Gretchen Whitmer are trying to win court rulings that would force Enbridge to remove the existing pipeline from the straits for good.

Construction could have major short-term, long-term impacts

The analysis notes that the tunnel would eliminate the risk of a boat anchor rupturing the pipeline and causing a spill in the straits, a key concern for environmentalists. But the construction would have sweeping effects on everything from recreation to wildlife.

Many of the impacts, such as noise, vistas marred by 400-foot (121-meter) cranes, construction lights degrading stargazing opportunities at Headlands International Dark Sky Park and vibrations that would disturb aquatic wildlife would end when the work is completed, the report found.

Other impacts would last longer, including the loss of wetlands and vegetation on both sides of the strait that connects Lake Huron and Lake Michigan, and the loss of nearly 300 trees that the northern long-eared bat and tricolored bat use to roost. Grading and excavation also could disturb or destroy archaeological sites.

The tunnel-boring machine could cause vibrations that could shift the area’s geology. Soil in the construction area could become contaminated and nearly 200 truck trips daily during the six-year construction period would degrade area roads, the analysis found. Gas mixing with water seeping into the tunnel could result in an explosion, but the analysis notes that Enbridge plans to install fans to properly ventilate the tunnel during excavation.

Enbridge has pledged to comply with all safety standards, replant vegetation where possible and contain erosion, the analysis noted. The company also has said it would try to limit the loudest work to daytime hours as much as possible, and offset harm to wetlands and protected species by buying credits through mitigation banks. That money can then be used to fund restoration in other areas.

“Our goal is to have the smallest possible environmental footprint,” Enbridge officials said in a statement.

The Sierra Club issued a statement Friday saying the tunnel remains “an existential threat.”

“Chances of an oil spill in the Great Lakes — our most valuable freshwater resource — skyrockets if this tunnel is built in the Straits,” the group said. “We can’t drink oil. We can’t fish or swim in oil.”

Julie Goodwin, a senior attorney with Earthjustice, an environmental law group that opposes the project, said the corps failed to consider the impacts of a spill that could still happen on either side of the straits or stopping the flow of oil through the Great Lakes.

“My key takeaways are the Army corps has put blinders are in service to Enbridge and President Trump’s fossil fuel agenda,” she said.

Tunnel would protect portion of Line 5 running through straits

Enbridge has been using the Line 5 pipeline to transport crude oil and natural gas liquids between Superior, Wisconsin, and Sarnia, Ontario, since 1953. Roughly 4 miles (6 kilometers) of the pipeline runs along the bottom of the Straits of Mackinac.

Concerns about the aging pipeline rupturing and causing a potentially disastrous spill in the straits have been building over the last decade. Those fears intensified in 2018 when an anchor damaged the line.

Enbridge contends that the line remains structurally sound, but it struck a deal with then-Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder’s administration in 2018 that calls for the company to replace the straits portion of the line with a new section that would be encased in a protective underground tunnel.

Enbridge and environmentalists spar in court battles

Environmentalists, Native American tribes and Democrats have been fighting in court for years to stop the tunnel and force Enbridge to remove the existing pipeline from the straits. They’ve had little success so far.

A Michigan appellate court in February validated the state Public Service Commission’s permits for the tunnel. Nessel sued in 2019 seeking to void the easement that allows Line 5 to run through the straits. That case is still pending. Whitmer revoked the easement in 2020, but Enbridge challenged that decision and a federal appellate court in April ruled that the case can proceed.

Another legal fight over Line 5 in Wisconsin

About 12 miles (19 kilometers) of Line 5 runs across the Bad River Band of Lake Superior Chippewa’s reservation in northern Wisconsin. That tribe sued in 2019 to force Enbridge to remove the line from the reservation, arguing it’s prone to spilling and that easements allowing it to operate on the reservation expired in 2013.

Enbridge has proposed a 41-mile (66-kilometer) reroute around the reservation. The tribe has filed a lawsuit seeking to void state construction permits for the project and has joined several other groups in challenging the permits through the state’s contested case process.

Public colleges are laying off scientists, canceling projects and turning away brilliant minds — not because we lack potential, but because Big Oil wants it that way.

Nuclear fission isn’t just another energy source — it’s a revolution. A single gram of uranium holds over a million times more energy than a gram of coal. Modern reactor designs are safer, smaller and can even run on spent fuel. Once operational, fission plants can provide uninterrupted, emissions-free electricity for decades at rock-bottom costs. No weather dependency. No supply chain chaos. Just pure, reliable energy — forever.

That’s exactly what the oil and gas lobby fears. If we crack fission wide open, their multi-trillion- dollar empire crumbles. So they do what they’ve always done: funnel cash to politicians, choke off federal research funding and gut science programs at the nation’s universities. The result? America’s best minds are being told to pack up and find something else to study — while China’s scientists build reactors that may one day power the world.

We’re not falling behind — we’re being dragged backward by greed. Every cut to higher education and nuclear research is another nail in the coffin of American energy independence and global leadership.

If we want to lead the future, we have to invest in it. Right now, we’re selling it off for one more tank of gas.

President Trump’s vision to unleash American energy and ensure U.S. global dominance can be realized by embracing the resilience of nuclear energy. Indeed, Mr. Trump can usher in America’s new economic, military and energy renaissance and forge a new era of American prosperity by embracing a new American nuclear future. He can make a strong case to his fellow citizens that there is no American dream without American atomic energy.

The ideal venue for President Trump to share his vision for “Energizing America” through nuclear energy should be from the deck of a nuclear-powered U.S. submarine. He can demonstrate the importance of and support for America’s nuclear renaissance by pointing out that America’s dominance of the global sea lanes has been made possible by nuclear energy, which ironically is also America’s largest source of clean energy. President Trump can argue that if the U.S. fails to lead in delivering nuclear technology, U.S. industries will struggle to compete, the U.S. economy will falter, and as a result, U.S. security at home and abroad will be severely weakened.

The good news is that there is bipartisan support in Congress to significantly expand America’s domestic capacity to generate reliable electricity, always on, and available without risk of outage. According to Senator Risch of Idaho, nuclear energy is the definitive solution to meet President Trump’s vision of making America great again. For example, as AI transforms our world, revolutionizes industries from health care to national security, and reshapes how we live and communicate, our dependence on electricity becomes critical.

Indeed, the race for AI dominance has launched a long-term stampede to connect to America’s vast electricity grid. Tech companies and data center providers need massive amounts of power as soon as possible. Trends suggest that by 2030, data centers for training AI models will require more than 5 gigawatts of electricity, which is about what Manhattan consumes on average. And beyond domestic AI needs, the US is locked into an existential struggle with China for AI supremacy. In short, America’s AI leadership will fall short if more nuclear energy isn’t developed.

President Trump can help accelerate his vision to “Energize America” by calling on the one company with the qualifications to immediately step up to the plate. Entra1 Energy is the exclusive commercialization partner of NuScale Power, the only technology provider and producer of small modular reactors (SMR) that has obtained U.S. nuclear regulatory approval and is ready for commercial deployment.

The advantages of the Entra1 Energy-NuScale alliance are fourfold. First, Entra1-NuScale has been certified by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), a process that can take at least 7 years.

In short, Nuscale is both deployable and can put power in the grid today. Second, NuScale can be deployed “behind the meter” and therefore, not pass on to consumers the higher costs of electricity needed to support America’s AI boom. This is important because at the current rate of total consumption, Americans can see a 70% increase in their electricity bills by 2030. Third, Entra1-NuScale can deploy its SMRs globally. As President Trump gets ready to travel to Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the U.A.E., he can also offer these countries, whose collective sovereign wealth exceeds $3 trillion, to consider companies such as Entra1-NuScale as their nuclear technology partner. And fourth, the Entra1-NuScale technology can help save lives. How? When a doctor is at an emergency room scanning the CT scans of millions of soldiers in hostile territory through 3D image recognition for wound assessment, he needs to ensure reliable and seamless access. Entra1-NuScale can provide this resilience and help save the lives of our brave men and women in uniform.

President Trump should take the following two steps to usher in a new era of American nuclear energy renewal. First, he should ask AI service providers such as NVIDIA, Microsoft, OpenAI, Google and Oracle to work with Nuscale to protect the American consumer but allow uninterrupted power to these leaders of America’s AI revolution. Second, Mr. Trump should instruct the Pentagon to sign with NuScale to provide reliable clean energy to bases inside and outside the US to stay ahead of China in the new race for AI dominance.

Specifically, the President can sign an Executive Order to direct the U.S. Air Force to start now (2025) to purchase power for 5 gigawatts from new SMR projects in the US to protect and grow the nation’s defense data centers and military drones/AI centers. For his Executive Order to be immediately actionable, he can state that the USAF utilize a Gen 3plus SMR technology that is: a) USNRC approved; b) uses readily available conventional fuel that is low-enriched; and c) SMRs deployable now with existing manufacturing facilities and supply chain capabilities. In practical terms, there is a direct connection between an Entra1-NuScale SMR and an MQ9 drone that is flying on enemy territory, taking millions of images for analysis by the US Air Force that cannot be interrupted because of lack of power or sabotage by Iranian, Russian or Chinese hackers.

By helping “Energize America” through nuclear energy, President Trump will ensure America’s long-term economic prosperity.

Community solar lets residential customers save money by sharing the electricity from a local solar array, which doesn’t have to be on their own property.","In other words, multiple businesses could form a shared ​“self-power” system with equipment for electricity generation or battery storage on adjacent land or on premises controlled by one or more of them. Such a system could include numerous generation or storage facilities, allowing a cluster of data centers, factories, or other large energy users to combine multiple behind-the-meter resources, whether they be natural gas, solar, batteries, or small nuclear when it becomes available.

The ability to combine resources means customers wouldn’t necessarily need lots of land to add renewable energy, said Benson. ​“If you want the most power quickly and cleanly, you can use rooftops and parking lots and build out a lot of small-scale generation.”

The law also reduces the overall tax burden for new electricity production. Local governments may collect less revenue but still welcome the jobs and other spending that come with new energy investments. And less stringent requirements might even benefit some communities when new power generation is sited, Borchers suggested.

Ohio’s current tangible personal property tax rates have been so high that companies have often used ​“payments in lieu of taxes,” also known as PILOT programs, to avoid getting walloped by huge tax bills as soon as energy production starts. But counties face somewhat strict requirements for how they must allocate PILOT payments. Developers that take advantage of the lower tax rates available under HB 15 may have more financial flexibility to be able to fund some projects that local governments want most, such as a new fire station or community center, Borchers said.

Taken together, the provisions in HB 15 promise to make it easier to build more solar in the state, industry representatives say.

The governor and legislature saw ​“the urgent need to expand energy generation as Ohio confronts rapidly increasing demand and the threat of escalating costs and supply shortages,” said Will Hinman, executive director for the Utility Scale Solar Energy Coalition of Ohio. ​“House Bill 15 is a critical step towards addressing these challenges by reducing barriers to energy development — including utility-scale solar projects.”

Ohio is still not a level playing field for clean energy

The law still requires projects to meet multiple criteria to benefit from its provisions. For example, power-generating facilities and transmission lines exceeding certain thresholds may need approval from the Ohio Power Siting Board. The state’s director of development must approve local governments’ designations of priority investment areas. And self-power systems have to be independent of the main power grid.

The biggest downside is that the new law left in place a 2021 statute, Senate Bill 52, which requires utility-scale renewable energy developments to get local approval, said Molly Bryden, a climate and sustainability researcher with think tank Policy Matters Ohio.

Under that earlier law, 34 of Ohio’s 88 counties have banned new solar generation in all or part of their territories. Even where the local law doesn’t bar a new project, local officials can still block projects before a developer even seeks a permit from the Ohio Power Siting Board. A county representative and a township representative also get to vote with state siting board members on whether facilities get a permit, even for some projects that were in the grid operator’s queue before the 2021 law.

Another law took effect in early 2023, letting local governments limit small solar and wind projects that connect to the grid but don’t otherwise fall within the scope of the 2021 law.

Requirements of the 2021 and 2023 laws don’t apply to generation fueled by natural gas, coal, or nuclear power. And Ohio’s high court has ruled local governments can’t ban or regulate gas wells and related infrastructure or even enforce broader zoning laws that would prevent such development.

Lawmakers also cut out provisions from an earlier version of HB 15 that would have allowed community solar development.

The Trump administration said the projects, which were approved by President Joe Biden's government, were not economically viable and would not serve U.S. energy interests.
Eastman officials did not respond to a request for comment on how the loss of federal support would affect the project, which would be the company's second chemical recycling facility for plastic waste.

The pullback of Eastman funding comes less than two months after another large plastics recycling project that had received $182 million in Biden DOE funding, an International Recycling Group project in Erie, Pa., canceled its own plans.","President Donald Trump's administration canceled a $375 million federal investment on May 30 for an Eastman Chemical Co. chemical recycling facility planned for Longview, Texas.

The halt in federal funding for the $1.2 billion Eastman project was part of a larger Department of Energy announcement canceling DOE grants for 24 renewable energy and decarbonization projects worth a total of $3.7 billion.

The Trump administration said the projects, which were approved by President Joe Biden's government, were not economically viable and would not serve U.S. energy interests.

Eastman officials did not respond to a request for comment on how the loss of federal support would affect the project, which would be the company's second chemical recycling facility for plastic waste.

On an April 25 earnings call, however, Eastman Chairman and CEO Mark Costa struck an optimistic tone, saying that “we're not getting an indication that the project is at risk.”

“We feel very good about where we are with the DOE,” he said. “They have been highly engaged with us. We think that we've got a good relationship there, and we think that our project actually holds up well in the way President Trump thinks about U.S. manufacturing.”

He said the Longview project fits U.S. security interests in onshoring manufacturing.

“It's also a national security way to make raw materials for food packaging, medical, et cetera,” Costa said. “It's onshoring jobs from Asia because most of all the PET business has now gone to China.”

The Longview plant would use a depolymerization technology to take plastic waste feedstock and produce virgin-quality materials for packaging and textiles.

When it was announced, Eastman said it would have capacity to process about 240 million pounds of plastic waste annually. The company's first molecular recycling plant is at its Kingsport, Tenn., headquarters.

A DOE news release did not name all 24 facilities and department officials did not respond to emails and a phone call for comment, but both the Longview News Journal and the online government-oriented news site NOTUS reported that Eastman's project was among those losing funding.

The Biden DOE had approved the $375 million Eastman funding in March 2024, using money from two laws passed in his presidency, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction Act.

But in the Trump administration's May 30 announcement, the DOE said the projects would not ""advance the energy needs"" of the U.S., were not economically viable and would not generate a positive return on investment on tax dollars.

""While the previous administration failed to conduct a thorough financial review before signing away billions of taxpayer dollars, the Trump administration is doing our due diligence to ensure we are utilizing taxpayer dollars to strengthen our national security, bolster affordable, reliable energy sources and advance projects that generate the highest possible return on investment,"" DOE Secretary Chris Wright said. ""Today, we are acting in the best interest of the American people by canceling these 24 awards.""

The DOE said that federal funding for 16 of the 24 projects was approved between Trump's election day victory in November and when he took office on Jan. 20, and primarily included funding for carbon capture and storage, and decarbonization initiatives.

A Washington-based clean energy research organization, however, said the cuts in what's known as the Industrial Demonstrations Program would ultimately hurt U.S. competitiveness.

""The Industrial Demonstrations Program could have been a centerpiece of achieving the administration's goal to bring manufacturing back to the United States,"" the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy said. ""Locking domestic plants into outdated technology is not a recipe for future competitiveness.""

Energy secretary Chris Wright said the moves were “due diligence” on the part of the Trump administration.
In total, 24 projects are affected by the move, including ones being developed by oil and gas giant Exxon Mobil, food manufacturer Kraft Heinz, industrial heat startup Skyven, cement and alumina startup Brimstone, and cement startup Sublime Systems.

Large corporations and growing startups were caught up in the decision.

Energy secretary Chris Wright said the moves were “due diligence” on the part of the Trump administration. His statement did not cite specific reasons why the projects were canceled, but pointed to a memorandum he issued on May 15, which suggests that the department may attempt to use its audit powers to rescind the awards.

In total, 24 projects are affected by the move, including ones being developed by oil and gas giant Exxon Mobil, food manufacturer Kraft Heinz, industrial heat startup Skyven, cement and alumina startup Brimstone, and cement startup Sublime Systems.

Here’s a sampling of some of the awards in jeopardy:

American Cast Iron Pipe Company (metal manufacturing): $75 million

Brimstone Energy (low-carbon materials): $189 million

Calpine’s Baytown Energy Center (natural gas power plant): $270 million

Calpine’s Sutter Energy Center (natural gas power plant): $270 million

Eastman Chemical Company’s Longview Plant (molecular plastic recycling): $375 million

Exxon Mobil’s Baytown Olefins Plant (chemical plant): $331.9 million

Skyven Technologies (heat pump steam generation): $15.3 million

Sublime Systems (low carbon cement): $86.9 million

Sublime told TechCrunch that it was caught off guard.

“Sublime was surprised and disappointed to receive the news about the termination of our Industrial Demonstrations Program award, given the clear progress we’ve made in scaling our American-invented technology, partnering with some of the Western World’s largest cement producers, and generating a bankable customer base,” spokesperson Rob Kreis said via email. The startup is evaluating its options to continue scaling up its operations.

Brimstone is hopeful that things can be resolved with the DOE.

“Given our project’s strong alignment with President Trump’s priority to increase U.S. production of critical minerals, we believe this was a misunderstanding. Brimstone’s Rock Refinery represents the only economically viable way to produce the critical mineral alumina in the U.S. from U.S.-mined rocks,” Brimstone spokesperson Liza Darwin told TechCrunch via email.

“As the first U.S.-based alumina plant in a generation, our project — which would also make portland cement — would clear a 'mine-to-metal' path for U.S. aluminum production, fortifying the U.S. critical mineral supply chain and creating thousands of jobs,” she added.

The $125,000 grant would fund a framework for early site permitting for nuclear technology, which could be used by other municipal utilities.

The study will assess the suitability of Lakeland Electric's land for different types of nuclear power plants, but doesn't require the utility to build one.

For more than a decade, the idea of Lakeland Electric purchasing or producing nuclear power to provide electricity to customers has been talked about.

Now the city's taking a small step that could make that a reality in the future.

Lakeland commissioners will vote June 2 on whether to accept a $125,000 Demonstration of Energy and Efficiency Developments grant from the American Public Power Association. With the funding, Lakeland Electric would develop a framework for an early site permitting process that other municipal utilities could follow for nuclear technology.

""We want to make sure Lakeland Electric is flexible enough if nuclear technology grows up and if we get to a point where Lakeland choses to go nuclear, we are able to do so,"" said Mike Dammer, LE's manager of emerging technology. ""Why start the process in 15 years if we can do part of the work now?""

With the funds, Dammer said Lakeland Electric will receive the APPA's assistance from experienced nuclear professionals in evaluating the utility's land sites and conducting environmental studies to determine their suitability as future locations for different kinds of nuclear power plants and technology.

""Many of the APPA member utilities are in the same boat we're in: We have no nuclear knowledge, with no nuclear background but are interested in nuclear going forward,"" he said.

Building on research by the national nonprofit Electric Power Research Institute, Deputy City Attorney Ramona Sirianni said the goal is to come up with a framework and set of procedures, or ""playbook,"" that municipal-owned utilities across the country can follow to get permits to build nuclear power plants.

The grant does not require Lakeland Electric to commit to building a nuclear power plant.

""We are not building a nuclear power plant as of right now,"" Dammer said. ""Getting an early site permit does not require you to build a [power] plant. It gives us the option to do so in the future.""

In 2020, Joel Ivy, Lakeland Electric's prior general manager, said he thought Lakeland Electric would make a major investment into nuclear energy if technology continued to advance over the next 10 to 15 years, with small modular nuclear reactors becoming more refined.

Commissioner Stephanie Madden has publicly spoken enthusiastically about the advancements in small modular nuclear reactors, sometimes called SMRs, as a future possibility.

""We could go into this study and find out that our site is just not suited for nuclear, that’s a very real possibility as well,"" Dammer said. ""We want to know what are our options.""

If city officials accept the grant, Lakeland Electric will have through April 1 to complete all necessary studies and work.

Even if Lakeland Electric's sites are found to not be well suited for nuclear, Dammer said the environmental studies performed can help the utility decide what might be the best use moving forward.

When Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in 2022, it was heralded as the most ambitious climate and industrial policy in decades. While its headline focused on clean energy and emissions reduction, the law is also proving to be a massive economic catalyst for historically overlooked regions, especially in Appalachia. From battery manufacturing in Pennsylvania to steel upgrades in Ohio and hydroelectric projects in Kentucky, federal investments are flowing into working-class communities that had long been dismissed as left behind. This is not just climate policy, it’s economic reinvestment, job creation, and community revitalization. Need more insight?

The GREET (greenhouse gases, regulated emissions and energy use in technologies) model was first developed by Argonne National Laboratory in 1994. The tool is designed to access the life cycle impacts of technologies, fuels, products and energy systems across various stages of the supply chain. The agency has since developed multiple GREET models designed for specific use cases.

The DOE in January 2025 released the 45ZCF-GREET model, which is specifically designed to calculate lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for the 45Z clean fuel production tax credit.

The agency has now updated the 45ZCF-GREET model, noting the changes “will allow a wider range of farmers and companies to do business in America’s thriving alternative fuels market.”

Information released by the DOE outlines eight specific changes the agency has made to 45ZCF-GREET. The changes include:

Added pathway for ethanol from U.S. corn wet mills. A simplified plant-level allocation by mass is applied to derive the results for ethanol. The same indirect emissions value per MJ for dry mill corn ethanol is applied to wet mill ethanol.

Revised Methanol input for biodiesel production to be entered in gallons as opposed to units of energy (MMBtu).

Added coal as a process input option for biodiesel via Transesterification pathways.

Clarifies in the GREET User Manual that Carbon capture utilization and sequestration (CCUS) allows CO₂ stored in U.S. Class II wells used for enhanced oil recovery (EOR), in addition to Class VI wells. (Note: No changes to model only revisions to user manual.)

Corrected Summary Table 9b. in the GREET User Manual to reflect final Indirect land use change (ILUC) emissions factors for soy and canola. (Note: No changes to model or modeled results, only correcting summary data as presented in the manual.)

Added pathway for alternative natural gas from coal mine methane (CMM) capture and upgrading.

Lifecycle emissions results updated to include the output in kilograms of CO₂ equivalent per million British thermal units (kg CO₂e/MMBtu), consistent with Section 45Z tax credit.

Added text to the GREET User Manual to quote Notice 2025-11, sec. 401 to clarify that these (and potential future) model updates, including new types, categories or pathways, may be used immediately.

“The Trump administration is committed to helping American fuel producers make the most of our country’s abundant biomass resources,” said Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Lou Hrkman. “The latest version of the 45ZCF-GREET model will allow more of our farmers to reap the benefits of a rapidly expanding market for alternative transportation fuels.”

Growth Energy is welcoming the new guidance, noting it will create jobs and unleash new investments. “By lifting needless restrictions on wet mills and different end uses for captured carbon, the updated user manual ensures that more farmers and biofuel producers will have the freedom and flexibility to invest in U.S. energy dominance while supporting stronger markets for American agriculture,” said Emily Skor, CEO of Growth Energy. “In conjunction with an extension of the credit under consideration by lawmakers, this guidance will help restore market certainty and increase American competitiveness in the race for the next generation of liquid fuel solutions. We applaud Energy Secretary Wright for working with the U.S. Department of the Treasury to deliver a fairer, more accurate model for calculating incentives that will help drive American energy dominance and spur economic growth.”

More broadly, as we reported last November, Biden’s “Investing in America” agenda was linked to $988 billion in private sector investments.
However, Donald Trump does not want the country or the world transitioning from polluting fossil fuels to clean energy and electric vehicles, and policy changes Republicans are moving through Congress put that preference onto paper, with disastrous results.

“Republican congressional districts, which have benefitted the most from the clean energy tax credits passed in 2022, also are seeing the most cancellations.","The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 was a great stimulus for new clean energy projects, EV factories, battery factories, etc. It led to massive new investments, reshoring of countless blue collar jobs, and a more vibrant economy for the fast-growing industries of the future.

More broadly, as we reported last November, Biden’s “Investing in America” agenda was linked to $988 billion in private sector investments.

However, Donald Trump does not want the country or the world transitioning from polluting fossil fuels to clean energy and electric vehicles, and policy changes Republicans are moving through Congress put that preference onto paper, with disastrous results.

According to a new analysis from the nonpartisan organization E2, so far this year, businesses have “cancelled or delayed more than $14 billion in investments and 10,000 new jobs in clean energy and clean vehicle factories” due to concerns about policy changes and especially removal of key tax credits. So much for being businesses friendly and supporting manufacturing in the United States.

Just in April, as talk of repealing clean energy policies heated up (not to mention the tariffs), $4.5 billion in investments in EV, wind power, and battery projects were cancelled. E2 notes that this is “in advance of the U.S. House’s passage of a massive tax and spending package that would essentially kill federal clean energy tax credits.”

In other words, the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” is going to cost us thousands of jobs and billions of dollars of private sector investment in the US.

Ironically, it’s Republican-controlled districts that are being the most hurt by this. “Republican congressional districts, which have benefitted the most from the clean energy tax credits passed in 2022, also are seeing the most cancellations. More than $12 billion and over 13,000 jobs have been cancelled in Republican districts so far.” Yet again, we have a case of Republican politicians doing things that hurt Republican voters — but all the politicians have to do is keep them scared and enraged about things that don’t really harm them and the rest is ignored or forgiven.

“Through April, over 61 percent of all clean energy projects announced—along with 72 percent of all jobs and 82 percent of all investments—are in congressional districts represented by Republicans,” E2 adds.

“Now is not the time to raise taxes on clean energy and compound the business uncertainty that is clearly taking a greater and greater toll on U.S. manufacturing and jobs,” E2 Communications Director Michael Timberlake commented.

“If the tax plan passed by the House last week becomes law, expect to see construction and investments stopping in states across the country as more projects and jobs are cancelled. Businesses are now counting on Congress to come to its senses and stop this costly attack on an industry that is essential to meeting America’s growing energy demand and that’s driving unprecedented economic growth in every part of the country.”

One can dream, but “counting on Congress to come to its senses” doesn’t seem advisable.

The good news is that so many projects were stimulated by the Inflation Reduction Act and other Investing in America policies that some of them will continue on anyway. Also, frankly, these are growing industries and that’s going to continue to be the case for years to come. “While cancellations continue to rise, companies continue to invest in the potential of America’s clean economy,” E2 writes. “Businesses in April announced nearly $500 million in investments for new solar, EV and grid and transmission equipment factories across six states – including a $400 million investment by Corning to expand a solar wafer factory in Michigan that is expected to create at least 400 new jobs and a $9.3 million investment by a Canadian solar equipment manufacturer for a new plant in North Carolina. Combined, the seven projects announced in April are expected to create nearly 3,000 new permanent jobs if completed.”",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Solar-Power-Battery-Energy-Storage-CleanTechnica-Watermark.png,N,,2025-05-30 17:07:39.670560

The ""One Big Beautiful Bill in Congress"" could bar tax credits for batteries produced using Chinese technology, impacting Ford's incoming Marshall plant that would be making battery cells using technology from Chinese battery giant CATL.

""The production tax credit that we made the investment around, it seems to be up for grabs,"" Ford Motor Company Executive Chair Bill Ford said.

BlueOval:

At a conference on Mackinac Island Thursday, Ford said the disappearance of tax credits for EV batteries will threaten their investment in the Marshall plant.

""We made a certain investment based upon a policy that was in place, it's not fair to change policies after all the expenditures have been made,"" Ford said. ""If it really doesn't stay, it will imperil what we do in Marshall.""

This comes amid other challenges the company has faced since building the battery park.

In 2024, Ford cut funding for the project. The state then scaled back their own investment from $210 million to $141 million, blaming a ""turbulent EV market.""

Once complete, BlueOval Battery Park is expected to create 1,700 local jobs when production of batteries for electric vehicles begins in 2026.

Ford believes the federal funding cuts put these jobs in jeopardy.

""We actually don't think it's fair to have offered all those jobs, about to open [the park] and then say, 'sorry, we're changing the policy,'"" Ford said. ""So I'm spending a lot of time, you know, talking about that with politicians.""

Progress:

Lounds is one of over 100 local entities who have in support of keeping the tax credits and continuing the investment in the plant.

""Marshall is a great community, and this would be something that would really help solidify us moving forward,"" Lounds said.

The ""One Big Beautiful Bill in Congress"" has to be passed by the U.S. Senate before heading to President Trump's desk.

,Kentucky American Energy ,2025-05-30 19:47:00+00:00,Canary Media,Trump admin cuts $3.7B for industrial decarbonization and carbon capture - Canary Media,Not Available,,,,,https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-industry/trump-cut-funding-oced,"But the feared elimination of money for carbon capture and industrial decarbonization has become a reality.
The Trump administration is getting rid of funding for several efforts to decarbonize the production of cement, one of the most carbon-intensive industries in the world.
That includes $189 million for Brimstone and $87 million for Sublime Systems, two startups pioneering new low-carbon cement production methods.
Global cement giant Heidelberg Materials will lose its $500 million award to capture carbon emissions at a massive existing cement plant in Indiana.
The DOE is also pulling funding for projects to replace fossil-fueled industrial heating equipment with heat pumps, electric boilers, and thermal energy storage systems.","The Department of Energy announced Friday that it is canceling over $3.7 billion in funding for projects that would cut carbon emissions and toxic air pollution from power plants and industrial sites, ranging from cement kilns to ketchup-processing plants.

The DOE shared a list of the projects to be cut with Canary Media on Friday, which showed that more than half of the awards under the ambitious Industrial Demonstrations Program, housed under the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, will be terminated. OCED funding focused on carbon capture at gas-fired power plants is also impacted.

DOE claimed the projects ​“failed to advance the energy needs of the American people, were not economically viable, and would not generate a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars.”

But advocates disagree. Not only would the projects kickstart efforts to clean up industries that are notoriously tricky to decarbonize — they would have generated serious economic benefits, too.

Analyses from groups including the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions and the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy have found that federal spending from OCED would have created hundreds of thousands of jobs nationwide and helped position U.S. industries to compete in international markets that are increasingly demanding cleaner materials and products.

Stakeholders have for months expected the Trump administration to cut the OCED awards, which were authorized under the Biden administration by the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law and the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.

In March and April, reports surfaced of plans by Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency to eliminate the office’s $6 billion Industrial Demonstrations Program, cut carbon capture and sequestration projects, and cancel billions of dollars of funding for clean-hydrogen hubs based in Democratic-leaning states.

Today’s announcement doesn’t include any hydrogen-hub funding cuts. But the feared elimination of money for carbon capture and industrial decarbonization has become a reality.

The Trump administration is getting rid of funding for several efforts to decarbonize the production of cement, one of the most carbon-intensive industries in the world. That includes $189 million for Brimstone and $87 million for Sublime Systems, two startups pioneering new low-carbon cement production methods. Global cement giant Heidelberg Materials will lose its $500 million award to capture carbon emissions at a massive existing cement plant in Indiana. And the National Cement Company of California won’t receive its $500 million grant to take a multi-technology approach to cutting emissions from its plant in Lebec, California.

The DOE is also pulling funding for projects to replace fossil-fueled industrial heating equipment with heat pumps, electric boilers, and thermal energy storage systems.

Kraft Heinz will lose its $170 million award to install clean heat technologies at 10 of its food production facilities. Beverage giant Diageo North America will no longer receive the $75 million it was promised to help install thermal energy storage systems from startup Rondo Energy at production facilities in Kentucky and Illinois. And Texas-based industrial heat pump manufacturer Skyven Technologies, which had been awarded a $145 million grant to install its technology at a New York state ethanol plant, was listed on DOE’s spreadsheet as having a $15 million grant rescinded. (DOE did not immediately respond to inquiries to determine whether Skyven was set to lose only part of its $145 million grant or if DOE’s spreadsheet was in error.)

Projects to cut pollution from factories that make metals are also on the chopping block. That includes a $75 million grant to back American Cast Iron Pipe Co.’s ​“Next Gen Melt Project,” which would have lowered emissions from iron and steelmaking at its site in Birmingham, Alabama. It also includes $75 million for United States Pipe and Foundry Co. to replace a coal-fired furnace with electric arc furnaces.

The DOE’s cancellations will also impact several projects seeking to reduce carbon emissions from glass production, including $75 million for Gallo Glass in Modesto, California; $57 million for Owens-Brockway Glass Container in Zanesville, Ohio; and $45 million for Libbey Glass in Toledo, Ohio.

Friday’s list also includes projects to cut carbon emissions from chemicals production, including $100 million for Ørsted to capture and use industrial carbon dioxide waste to make shipping fuel at its Star e-Methanol facility in Texas; $375 million for Eastman Chemical Co.’s plastics recycling project in Longview, Texas; and $331 million for Exxon Mobil to use hydrogen instead of fossil gas for ethylene production in Baytown, Texas.

Funding for carbon capture and storage projects at power plants will be scrapped, too. Calpine will not receive a pair of $270 million awards to retrofit power plants in Texas and California.

The list did not include some high-profile metals decarbonization projects, like the $575 million in grants set to flow to two Cleveland-Cliffs steel facilities in Pennsylvania and Ohio — the latter in Middletown, Vice President JD Vance’s hometown — or the $500 million for Century Aluminum to build a ​“green smelter,” likely in Kentucky.

What remains unclear is the extent to which Friday’s cancellations have disrupted ongoing construction, hiring of workers, or other unrecoverable commitments from companies impacted. Firms have been tight-lipped about plans to navigate the consequences of federal funding clawbacks. All of the awards required participating companies to invest at least as much as they were set to receive in federal grants.

A representative of Sublime Systems told Canary Media that the company was ​“surprised and disappointed” by DOE’s decision to cut its grant. Sublime this week announced a deal with Microsoft, which said it would buy 600,000 tons of the low-carbon cement to be produced from the startup’s first commercial-scale plant in Holyoke, Massachusetts — a plant backed by DOE’s grant.

“It is our hope to continue to partner with the DOE to show a success story of American innovation and ingenuity at its finest,” Sublime’s representative said in a Friday email. ​“Nevertheless, we have prepared for the possibility of this disappointing outcome and are evaluating various scenarios that leave our scale-up unimpeded.”

The projects are without a doubt now on far shakier financial footing, and advocates do not expect that they’ll be able to move forward without the federal funding. Should they fail, the effects would be profound, according to Evan Gillespie, a partner at advocacy group Industrious Labs.

“[The projects] would have helped catapult the U.S. into a leadership position in the technologies that will bring down emissions and pace the next generation of industrial evolution,” he said. ​“Killing these projects means more emissions, more pollution, and more people getting sick.”

Energy Secretary Chris Wright, a former oil and gas industry executive who insists that climate change is not a crisis, said in Friday’s announcement that the decision would benefit U.S. taxpayers.

“While the previous administration failed to conduct a thorough financial review before signing away billions of taxpayer dollars, the Trump administration is doing our due diligence to ensure we are utilizing taxpayer dollars to strengthen our national security, bolster affordable, reliable energy sources and advance projects that generate the highest possible return on investment,” he said.

Industrial decarbonization advocates pushed back.

“This program could have been a centerpiece of achieving the administration’s goal to bring manufacturing back to the United States,” Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, said in a Friday statement. ​“Choosing to cancel these awards is shortsighted, and I think we’re going to look back at this moment with regret. Locking domestic plants into outdated technology is not a recipe for future competitiveness or bringing manufacturing jobs back to American communities.”",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/GettyImages-2213269576.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=fe009fbf92252e9a29b1f3e443e57600,N,,2025-05-30 18:09:17.036675

There are no direct changes to the direct-pay option, which effectively makes applicable tax credits “refundable” tax credits.
In addition to the proposed changes to the energy credits addressed above, the Act proposes to terminate the following energy credits: Section 6418 — Third Party Sales of Eligible Credits Current Law.
The third-party sale provisions provide an alternative for renewable energy developers to monetize their tax credits without accessing the tax equity markets.
Section 6418 and the related Treasury Regulations provided various requirements that must be satisfied in order for eligible credits to be sold and eligible credits may not be transferred more than once.","On May 22, 2025, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (Act). The Act includes an accelerated repeal schedule of significant renewable energy tax credits and more restrictive amendments than those initially introduced in the House Ways and Means Committee’s proposed bill (Bill), which was approved by the Ways and Means Committee on May 14, 2025.

As described more fully below, among the changes proposed to the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the IRA)1, the Act includes the following:

repeal of the technology-neutral tax credits (i.e., Section 45Y Clean Electricity Production Credit (45Y PTC) and Section 48E Clean Electricity Investment Credit (48E ITC)) for projects (i) on which construction begins more than 60 days following the date of the Act’s enactment or (ii) that are placed in service after 2028 (without regard to when construction begins)

acceleration, or provision for, the phaseout of most other energy credits

repeal of the credit transferability provision starting (i) two years after enactment of the Act, for the 45Q Carbon Oxide Sequestration Credit, or (ii) in 2028, for the Section 45X Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit and the Section 45Z tax credits Clean Fuel Production Credit

introduction of restrictions and limitations for claiming energy credits by adding foreign entity of concern (FEOC) related provisions starting in 2026

Key Takeaways

If enacted, the Act will significantly affect the renewable energy industry and adversely affect the ability to develop and finance various renewable energy projects.

The new FEOC-related restrictions may cause taxpayers and projects that would otherwise be eligible for such tax credits to lose their eligibility due to ownership and supply-chain issues. Accordingly, the inclusion of the FEOC-related provisions and their broad application will need to be carefully analyzed and discussed in connection with existing and future commercial arrangements.

The Act generally does not affect energy projects that began construction by the end of 2024 and are eligible for tax credits pursuant to Section 48 (Section 48 ITC) and Section 45 (Section 45 PTC). The Act also does not directly change the domestic content or energy community adders, although those adders would be subject to accelerated phaseout (or repeal) in the same manner as the base credits. There are no direct changes to the direct-pay option, which effectively makes applicable tax credits “refundable” tax credits.

The Act now moves to the Senate for continuing debates and negotiations. Numerous Senate Republicans stated that they will have additional changes to the Act and voiced objections to the accelerated phaseout of certain energy credits.

Changes to Existing Energy Credit Provisions

Section 48E / Section 45Y — Zero Emission / Clean Electricity ITCs and PTCs

Current Law. For projects beginning construction after 2024, the IRA replaced the Section 45 PTC and Section 48 ITC with corresponding “technology neutral” credits: the Section 45Y PTC and the Section 48E ITC. Each of these credits is currently subject to a phaseout starting in 2034 (or later, depending on changes in greenhouse gas emissions).

Proposed Changes. The Act proposes to terminate the Section 45Y PTC and Section 48E ITC for any qualified facility that (i) begins construction more than 60 days after the date of the enactment of the Act or (ii) that is placed in service after December 31, 2028. Advanced nuclear facilities and expansions of nuclear facilities that begin construction before January 1, 2029, remain eligible for the Section 45Y PTC or the Section 48E ITC. This differs from the proposal in the Bill that provided an accelerated phaseout of the credits tied to the year in which the project is placed in service (rather than the year in which construction begins).

Key Takeaways. The proposed elimination of the phaseout schedule and the repeal of these credits for projects that either did not begin construction by the end of the 60-day period following the enactment of the Act or will not be placed in service before 2029 is significant and will adversely affect wind, solar, battery storage, and other renewable energy projects.

Under current law, the full credit amount would be available for projects that begin construction prior to 2034 (or later, depending on changes in greenhouse gas emissions). Under existing Internal Revenue Service “beginning-of-construction” guidance, a project satisfying the “physical work test” or “5% safe harbor” in a particular year will be treated as beginning construction in that year so long as it is placed in service during the four years following that year. Accordingly, under current law, projects beginning construction in 2033 would be eligible for the full credit amount so long as they are placed in service before 2038.

If the Act is enacted in its current form, taxpayers that have not yet begun construction on projects intended to qualify for the Section 45Y PTC or the Section 48E ITC will need to evaluate their current construction schedules and consider strategies for satisfying the beginning of construction requirement during the 60-day period following the Act’s enactment. In this regard, while it seems reasonable to assume that the same beginning-of-construction rules that have historically applied in the context of renewable energy projects (i.e., the “physical work test” and the “5% safe harbor”) will apply for these purposes, this is a point that may require confirmation from the Department of the Treasury.

Section 45Q — Carbon Oxide Sequestration Credit

Current Law. Section 45Q entitles taxpayers who (i) own carbon capture equipment used to capture qualified carbon oxide from an industrial facility or from the atmosphere and (ii) physically or contractually sequester or use it for certain purposes as provided by Section 45Q to a credit for each metric ton of qualified carbon oxide captured and sequestered or used during the 12-year period starting on the date the equipment is first placed in service. Taxpayers may claim the Section 45Q credit if construction on a qualified facility begins before January 1, 2033.

Proposed Changes. The Act does not accelerate the expiration of the Section 45Q credit, nor does the Act introduce a phaseout concept applicable to the credit. However, the proposal to repeal the transferability of the tax credits, pursuant to Section 6418, and the new foreign entity of concern provisions (both explained in greater detail in separate sections below) apply to the credit.

Section 45U — Zero Emission Nuclear Power Production Credit

Current Law. The IRA added Section 45U, which provides a two-tier credit, adjusted for inflation, per kWh of electricity produced at a qualified nuclear facility and sold to an unrelated party after 2023 and before 2033.

Proposed Changes. The Act proposes an accelerated phaseout schedule for the Section 45U Zero Emission Nuclear Power PTC based on the year in which the project is placed in service, as follows:

Section 45V — Clean Hydrogen Production Credit

Current Law. The IRA added Section 45V, which provides a two-tier, inflation-adjusted, 10-year PTC for clean hydrogen produced after 2022 at a qualified facility, the construction of which begins before 2033.

Proposed Changes. The Act proposes to terminate the Section 45V Clean Hydrogen Production Credit effective for projects on which construction commences after December 31, 2025, which is seven years earlier than the sunset date under the IRA.

Section 45X — Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit

Current Law. The IRA added Section 45X, which provides tax credits for manufacturers of eligible components that are produced and sold by a taxpayer to an unrelated party. The Section 45X credit amount varies depending on the eligible component. The Section 45X credit begins phasing out in 2030 and is not available for components sold after 2032.

Proposed Changes. The Act proposes to terminate the Section 45X credits for wind energy components sold after December 31, 2027. The Act further proposes an accelerated phaseout schedule for all other eligible components, as follows:

Section 45Z — Clean Fuel Production Credit

Current Law. The IRA added Section 45Z, which provides a clean fuel production tax credit for taxpayers who produce and sell qualifying transportation fuel to an unrelated party before January 1, 2028, with the credit amount determined, in part, by reference to the fuel’s greenhouse gas emissions rate. Among other requirements, the fuel must be produced in the United States for the taxpayer to be eligible for the Section 45Z credit.

Proposed Changes. In contrast to most of the other energy credits, the Act proposes to extend the period this credit can be claimed by four years, until December 31, 2031, but proposes changes to the eligibility requirements and calculation of the credit.

The Act proposes to limit the availability of the Section 45Z credit for fuel sold after December 31, 2025, to fuel that is exclusively derived from a feedstock that was produced or grown in the United States, Mexico, or Canada rather than solely requiring that the fuel be produced in the United States.

The Act also makes two changes to how the emissions rate used in determining the credit amount is calculated. First, the Act provides that the amount of lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions shall be adjusted as necessary to exclude any emissions attributed to indirect land use change. Second, with respect to any transportation fuel derived from animal manure, a distinct emissions rate shall be provided with respect to each of the specific feedstocks used to such produce such fuel (i.e., dairy manure, swine manure, poultry manure, and such other sources determined by the Secretary of the Treasury).

Termination of Other Energy Credits

Proposed Changes. In addition to the proposed changes to the energy credits addressed above, the Act proposes to terminate the following energy credits:

Section 6418 — Third Party Sales of Eligible Credits

Current Law. The IRA added Section 6418 to the Code, which allows eligible taxpayers to transfer all or a portion of their eligible credits for cash, to a taxpayer that is not related to the transferor taxpayer (within the meaning of Section 267(b) or 707(b)(1)). The third-party sale provisions provide an alternative for renewable energy developers to monetize their tax credits without accessing the tax equity markets. Section 6418 and the related Treasury Regulations provided various requirements that must be satisfied in order for eligible credits to be sold and eligible credits may not be transferred more than once.

Proposed Changes. The Act proposes to repeal the transferability provisions with respect to various credits. The chart below lists the affected credits and the effective date of the repeal of their transferability.

Key Takeaways. The proposed repeal of the transferability of the various tax credits is likely to have a material impact on the development and financing of various projects. This alternative method of monetizing the various tax credits had a positive impact on the market since the enactment of the IRA and assisted developers with financing their projects. During taxable year 2024, it is estimated that tax credits in excess of $25 billion were sold pursuant to these rules. Repealing this monetization alternative will require developers and sponsors to rely mainly on the tax equity financing, which was a market historically capped at approximately $20 billion. This may adversely affect the number of projects developed.

There are no changes to the transferability rules for projects eligible for the Section 45Y PTC or Section 48E ITC (contrary to the suggested repeal of these transferability rules as initially proposed in the Bill). However, this should not provide significant comfort to developers of wind, solar, battery storage, and other technologies generally eligible for such tax credits due to the general accelerated repeal of these credits, as discussed above.

Newly Proposed Energy Credit Provisions/Restrictions

In addition to the repeals and accelerated phaseout schedules for existing energy credit provisions, the Act introduces complex restrictions relating to certain relationships with “prohibited foreign entities” (PFEs). These restrictions broaden the category of restricted foreign entities from the Department of Energy’s interpretation of FEOC to the more expansive category of PFEs.

These rules apply to most energy credits, including (as applicable) the Section 45Y PTC, Section 48E ITC, Section 45Q Carbon Oxide Sequestration Credit, Section 45U Zero-Emission Nuclear Power PTC, and Section 45X Advanced Manufacturing PTC.

In general, these restrictions are divided into two sets of restrictions. The first set includes restrictions related to projects owned by a “specified foreign entity” (SFE) or entities controlled or influenced by SFEs. The second set includes restrictions related to projects in which SFEs or entities controlled or influenced by SFEs provide material assistance in connection with the design, construction, or operation of the project.

Ownership-Related Restrictions

Starting in 2026, no tax credit is allowed if a project is owned by an SFE. An SFE is generally an entity that is either (i) identified by reference to an enumerated list of authorities as a threat to the security of the United States or (ii) a “foreign-controlled entity.” A domestic entity will be an SFE only if it is a “foreign-controlled entity,” which generally requires more than 50% ownership by entities with ties to North Korea, China, Russia, and Iran.4

The ownership rules become more restrictive starting two years after enactment of the Act. At that time, no credit will be allowed if the entity that owns the project is a “foreign-controlled entity” or is a “foreign-influenced entity.”

The definition of a “foreign-influenced entity” is much broader than the definition of a foreign-controlled entity. An entity will be treated as a “foreign-influenced entity” during a taxable year if

- an SFE (including foreign-controlled entities and entities otherwise identified as SFEs) has the direct or indirect authority to appoint a board member, executive officer, or person with similar powers

- a single SFE has an ownership interest of 10% or more

- multiple SFEs hold, in the aggregate, ownership interests of 25% or more

- one or more SFEs hold 25% or more of the entity’s outstanding debt

- payments of certain fixed, determinable, annual, or periodic payments (e.g., dividends, interests, royalites, rents, service fees) (FDAP Payments) knowingly made to a single SFE exceed 10% of the amount of such payments for the prior taxable year

- FDAP payments knowingly made to one or more SFEs exceed 25% of the amount of such payments for the prior taxable year

Project/Facility-Level Restrictions

In addition to the ownership restrictions, a project will not be eligible for the Section 45Y PTC, Section 48E ITC, or Section 45X credit if the construction of the project (or production of components in the case of Section 45X) begins following December 31, 2025 (or two years in the case of the Section 45X credit), and such construction (or production of components) includes “material assistance” from a prohibited foreign entity (i.e., an SFE or foreign-influenced entity).

The term “material assistance” means, with respect to any property,

(i) any component, subcomponent, or applicable critical mineral (as defined in Section 45X(c)(6)) included in such property that is extracted, processed, recycled, manufactured, or assembled by a prohibited foreign entity

(ii) any design of such property based on any copyright or patent held by a prohibited foreign entity or any knowhow or trade secret provided by a prohibited foreign entity

“Material assistance” does not include any assembly part, subcomponent, or constituent material provided that such part or material is not (i) exclusively or predominantly produced by PFE, (ii) acquired directly from a PFE, and (iii) uniquely designed for use in construction of a Section 48E ITC or Section 45Y PTC facility or a Section 45X eligible component.5

In addition to the foregoing, for any taxable year beginning after the date that is two years following the date of enactment of the Act, the existence of FDAP Payments made to one or more PFEs during that taxable year would also lead to the ineligibility for such tax credits, if such payments are made

- to a single PFE in an amount equal to or greater than 5% of the total of such payments made during that taxable year or

- to multiple PFEs in an amount equal to or greater than 15% of the total of such payments made during that taxable year.

In the case of Section 48E ITC, the violation of these FDAP Payments rules during the 10-year period following the date the applicable project was placed in service will trigger a 100% recapture of the Section 48E ITC previously claimed.

Section 45X Related Restrictions

In addition to the general ownership and components related restrictions above, there are certain other operational restrictions that could prevent manufacturers from claiming the Section 45X tax credits.

Starting two years after the enactment of the Act, no Section 45X credits will be allowed if the production of certain applicable components is made with “material assistance” from a PFE. In addition to the definition above, “material assistance” for purposes of Section 45X will also be found if

- any design of the component is based on any copyright or patent held by a PFE, or any knowhow or trade secret provided by a PFE, or

- such component is produced subject to a licensing agreement with a PFE with value exceeding $1 million.

Key Takeaways

The imposition of the new FEOC-related restrictions and the broad definitions of the related terms introduce significant complexity to the planning and analysis related to the eligibility of projects for the applicable tax credits. This together with the relatively short transition period included in the Act will require market participants to quickly reevaluate and potentially restructure their ownership and relevant supply chain and related commercial arrangements to mitigate the related risks if the Act will be enacted without changes.

The Act will now be reviewed and negotiated in the Senate, and further revisions to some of these rules are likely. We will continue to monitor this process and provide updates.

Timothy Male is the executive director of the nonprofit Environmental Policy Innovation Center.","In the clash between the competing pro-petroleum and pro-climate visions of the economy, few policy issues are as misunderstood and complicated as our nation’s environmental permitting systems.

The number of permitting actions is enormous.

During a single presidential term, approximately 1.5 million permitting, informal review, and consultation processes are overseen under just five environmental and historic preservation laws. Many of these cover minor actions that would never have required permits in the 1970s and 1980s.

Consider the National Environmental Policy Act. Roughly 400,000 “categorical exclusions” are processed under this law each presidential term, compared to about 1,000 major reviews called “environmental impact statements.” An exclusion isn’t an absence of review; instead, it is akin to a simpler kind of permit. There are categorical exclusions to cover summer picnics by federal agencies, a 90- to 120-day exclusion process for a loan to replace powerlines across North Dakota wheat fields, or exclusions for every Agriculture Department grant to a farmer. Most exclusions involve minimal staff hours and are completed in weeks to months, making it hard to object to any one review. But collectively, their issuance requires hundreds of staff and millions of days of project delays.

Over four years, about a million similar, small permit processes will run their course under the Endangered Species Act, Clean Water Act, Clean Air Act and especially the National Historic Preservation Act.

Yet almost all the attention on reform has focused on the small number of “big” permits.

For example, President Biden’s permitting team reported cutting 25 percent off the average processing time for those 1,000 major environmental impact statements, compared to the first Trump administration, whose permits were also faster than the administration of Obama.

On big permits, Democratic administrations have favored adding staff to write and review documents. That strategy works, but it can be hard to maintain, particularly if agency budgets get cut. And most of the laborious steps to finish an impact statement remained unchanged, with some becoming more expansive.

Republicans tend to favor the wholesale elimination of major permits — at least for fossil fuel infrastructure — and cutting staff. That pattern showed up across President Trump’s executive orders. If maintained by courts and Congress, those orders would eliminate some National Environmental Policy Act regulations and skip most requirements to protect clean water and endangered wildlife by calling permit issuance an emergency. Democrats are increasingly flirting with exemptions for different categories of projects — wind and solar instead of oil and gas, for example.

A problem with taking away major permits is that they often have very significant impacts on things that communities in both red and blue states value. Permit reviews can produce much less harmful outcomes.

Addressing the millions of smaller permits is a missed opportunity with fewer downsides.

First, we should entirely eliminate thousands of small permits by defining the actions they cover as not “major federal actions” — the original, intended scope of the National Environmental Policy Act. For instance, a provision in proposed permitting legislation redefines all grants and loans this way. This change would benefit thousands of towns, cities, nonprofits and businesses that receive federal funding and wouldn’t affect public input because few categorical exclusions ever involve the public in the first place.

Second, we can improve remaining small permit processes by expanding reforms that have proven successful in dramatically accelerating timelines and reducing workload while still avoiding or compensating for harms caused by projects.

For example, government agencies are increasingly using technology-based ‘dashboards’ that allow anyone to track the status of an application and exactly which staff are reviewing it. Virginia has achieved the greatest success with this technology, alongside procedural reforms, delivering an expected 70 percent reduction in application review times for 200,000 state decisions over four years. The Department of Energy is piloting AI technologies that could allow more than 80 percent of small permit documents to be machine written.

Self-permitting under general permits is another promising reform. Projects that agree to use what are effectively common-sense best practices to avoid harm are automatically approved if they submit the paperwork that proves those practices will be followed. General permits exist under clean water and wildlife laws, although the paperwork required to get these automatic approvals could still be significantly reduced.

Offsets — which are opportunities to compensate for unavoidable environmental impacts — also help. Having a supply of pre-approved beneficial offsets has sped up some Clean Water Act permitting by 50 percent. We can’t build everything Americans want without having any environmental effect, and having offsets available allows unavoidable harm to be balanced with benefits to similar environmental features nearby.

The most important change needed to improve or eliminate millions of small procedures is a culture shift among both permitting agencies and permit applicants. Many government staff are dedicated public servants, but some view institutional caution as a mission and environmental permitting as a battleground instead of an opportunity to problem-solve with constituents.

On the other side, many applicants blame agencies when they themselves have submitted flawed or incomplete applications, proposed unreasonable projects, or rejected the idea of regulatory oversight, failing to respect the reality that most Americans want to unlock growth while also stewarding the environment.

Making a million small processes more agile, responsive and effective is a key step toward a government that strikes these balances, and that serves the needs of all Americans.

Designed for narrow streets, the one-seater EV has garnered significant pre-orders, potentially surpassing Toyota's EV sales in Japan. Priced at ¥1 million, the mibot targets rural areas and aims to address skepticism towards EVs with its minimalist design and low production costs.

A Japanese startup, KG Motors, is aiming to boost Japan's electric vehicle (EV) market with an ultra-compact, affordable one-seater EV called the mibot, according to Bloomberg. Resembling a futuristic golf cart, the mibot is designed for Japan's narrow streets and has already pre-sold over half of the 3,300 units planned for delivery in 2027. This puts KG Motors on track to surpass Toyota, which sold around 2,000 EVs in Japan in 2024. This reportedly puts KG Motors on track to sell more EVs in Japan than the world’s biggest automaker, Toyota Motor Corp., which shifted around such 2,000 vehicles in all of 2024. In a country where EVs are still a rare sight, KG Motors is trying to bust a burgeoning myth: That Bigger is Better. “Cars are simply too big,” said Kazunari Kusunoki, KG Motors’ founder and CEO, as quoted by Bloomberg. The mibot, priced at ¥1 million ($7,000) before tax, is half the cost of Japan’s popular Nissan Sakura EV. It offers a 100-kilometer range, a five-hour charge time, and a top speed of 60 km/h. Production is set to begin in October at a new factory east of Hiroshima. Japan’s EV market lags globally, with EVs making up just 3.5% of vehicle sales in 2023 compared to the global average of 18%, per BloombergNEF. Toyota’s multi-pathway approach, favoring hybrids alongside EVs, has shaped public skepticism about EVs’ popularity, Kusunoki noted. However, small kei cars like the Sakura, which sold nearly 23,000 units in 2024, dominate Japan’s EV market. KG Motors’ mibot, with its minimalist design and low production costs, targets rural areas with declining public transport. Bloomberg reports that 95% of the 2,250 pre-orders come from homeowners with at least one vehicle. The startup expects to break even on its second batch of 3,000 units and aims to produce 10,000 annually thereafter.

The move is part of a broader rollback of 24 clean energy projects nationwide that “failed to advance the energy needs of the American people,” according to U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright.
The decision comes more than a year after the federal government announced $6 billion in funding for dozens of industrial decarbonization projects across the country, including six in Texas.
With Friday’s announcement, funding for four of the six Texas projects has now been rescinded.
“Choosing to cancel these awards is shortsighted, and I think we’re going to look back at this moment with regret.”","The U.S. Department of Energy on Friday canceled more than $1 billion in clean energy funding for Texas as part of a continuing effort to reduce federal spending.

The move is part of a broader rollback of 24 clean energy projects nationwide that “failed to advance the energy needs of the American people,” according to U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright.

“The Trump administration is doing our due diligence to ensure we are utilizing taxpayer dollars to strengthen our national security, bolster affordable, reliable energy sources and advance projects that generate the highest possible return on investment,” he said.

Among the canceled awards is a $331.9 million grant to ExxonMobil to replace natural gas with hydrogen at its Baytown Olefins Plant — a move that was expected to cut the facility’s emissions by more than half. Also canceled were a $270 million grant to Calpine for a carbon-capture facility in Baytown, a $375 million award to Eastman Chemical for a molecular recycling project in Longview, and a $99 million grant to Orsted for a clean methanol initiative along the Gulf Coast.

A spokesperson for ExxonMobil declined to comment on Friday. Calpine, Eastman Chemical and Orsted didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.

The decision comes more than a year after the federal government announced $6 billion in funding for dozens of industrial decarbonization projects across the country, including six in Texas. With Friday’s announcement, funding for four of the six Texas projects has now been rescinded.

According to Energy Secretary Wright, the decision is expected to generate “an immediate $3.6 billion in savings for the American people.” Critics, however, argue the cancellations threaten the country’s energy innovation and manufacturing future.

“This program could have been a centerpiece of achieving the administration’s goal to bring manufacturing back to the United States,” said Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy. “Choosing to cancel these awards is shortsighted, and I think we’re going to look back at this moment with regret.”",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f3d6b80/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5551x2914+0+393/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F46%2F3c%2Feba0b2c84e2ba148f5a296dddc24%2Fpower-plant-weatherization-tour-51629999110-o.jpg,N,,2025-05-30 16:09:38.611765

Carbon pricing shifts the external costs of greenhouse gas emissions back to the source of pollution.

Carbon border adjustment mechanisms (CBAMs) generally work by looking at the carbon intensity of an imported material compared to the same material produced domestically. If producing the imported product released more carbon emissions than the production of its domestic counterpart, the entity importing the good is taxed the difference.

The Clean Competition Act (3422/H.R.6622) from the 118th Congress and the Foreign Pollution Fee Act (S.1325), which was reintroduced in April 2025, both aim to set a price on carbon-intensive imported products.

The shift to domestic production, which would likely be spurred by a CBAM-like policy, could create an estimated 30,000 jobs in the steel and aluminum industries annually, according to Third Way.

Greenhouse gas emissions come with a real and substantial price tag, whether from rising sea levels, increased healthcare costs in heavily industrialized communities, or crop damage. Carbon pricing shifts the external costs of greenhouse gas emissions from society back to the source of pollution. With a carbon price, often set per ton of carbon dioxide emitted, the cost of emissions partially rests on the original emitters. There are a variety of methods for pricing emissions, including carbon taxes, cap and trade, and regulations and standards.

Nations that implement carbon pricing within their borders can consider pairing that with a carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM), which levels the playing field by ensuring that both domestic and foreign manufacturers pay the cost of their pollution. Implementing a CBAM without a domestic carbon pricing policy would likely be considered protectionism by trading partners, and could invite retaliation.

Inversely, policy analysts emphasize that environmental degradation is an unfair trade practice. Regulations generally increase the cost of production, so countries with lower industry standards can make cheaper products, but usually with a higher overall emissions intensity. The status quo system perpetuates U.S. companies importing inexpensive and carbon-intensive materials.

The European Union and the United Kingdom, which both have domestic carbon pricing policies in place, have both recently announced CBAM initiatives to tax imported carbon-intensive products and account for the direct and indirect emissions associated with their manufacturing. These CBAM policies work by looking at the carbon intensity of an imported product compared to the same product produced domestically. If producing the imported product released more carbon emissions than the production of its domestic counterpart, the entity importing the good is taxed the difference.

The emissions intensity of a product accounts for the material inputs, off-site electricity and heat, and final product manufacturing emissions (like raw material extraction or transportation). In 2021, stainless steel produced in Indonesia emitted 4.25 times the amount of greenhouse gases of steel produced in the United States, and the steel industry in China had double the emissions intensity of the U.S. steel industry.

CBAM market-based climate policies also aim to limit carbon leakage, or the transfer of production-related emissions to another country to avoid regulation or fees. For example, if a country in Europe should decide to import all of its steel because it is carbon intensive to produce, it would no longer be held accountable for any steel-related carbon emissions. Its domestic emissions would fall, making it easier to meet carbon reduction goals, but overall emissions would likely rise, which would defeat the goals’ purpose. With a CBAM, if the country is importing carbon-intensive steel, there will be a cost associated with that, putting more responsibility on the consuming country. In this way, a CBAM ideally incentivizes trade partners to reduce their production-related emissions.

There are numerous ways to implement a CBAM-like program. Each goes by a different name—CBAM, Methane Border Adjustment Mechanism (Methane BAM), Border Pollution Mechanism, and Foreign Pollution Fee—and involves different fine print, players, and intensity.

In recent years, proposed policies in the United States have attempted to launch carbon pricing mechanisms similar to those across the pond. In the 118th Congress, the Clean Competition Act (S.3422/H.R.6622) and the Foreign Pollution Fee Act (S.3198) both aimed to set a price on carbon-intensive products, but with starkly different approaches. Neither bill made it past introduction last Congress, but the Foreign Pollution Fee Act (S.1325) was reintroduced by Sens. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) and Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) in the 119th Congress in April 2025.

The revenue from the Clean Competition Act’s CBAM, championed by Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), would be directed towards decarbonization, while the Foreign Pollution Fee Act does not specify where the revenue would be sent. The latter focuses more on boosting domestic manufacturing and national security under the Made in America policy agenda, with emissions reductions as a secondary benefit. Furthermore, the foreign pollution fee would only tax imported goods, while the Clean Competition Act would tax both imported and domestic products relative to their carbon emissions. Although emission reductions are likely to be more significant if domestic manufacturers also have a financial incentive to reduce product emissions intensity, a domestic carbon tax is a harder sell politically.

Sens. Whitehouse and Cassidy often speak about their ideas for CBAM-like programs. In February 2025, the Silverado Policy Accelerator hosted a fireside chat with the two lawmakers to examine the impact of carbon pricing on the United States and its trade partners. Silverado presented new research about the potential environmental and economic benefits of a CBAM for the trade of aluminum and steel, which are both carbon intensive to produce. Steel and aluminum are the first products to be affected by the European Union CBAM.

The Silverado study applied two fee-setting approaches: per ton and relative difference. The per ton fee looks at the difference between imported emissions-intensive goods and goods produced domestically, then applies a dollar amount per additional metric ton of carbon emitted by the foreign manufacturer. The relative difference fee is based on the assessed value of the item and set at a rate of either 0.6% or 0.9% for every 1% more emissions intensive the import is than the domestic product.

Using wrought aluminum as an example, if the tax is $55 per metric ton of carbon dioxide equivalent (the starting fee of the Clean Competition Act), then there would be an estimated 18% decrease in imports to the United States from more carbon-intensive sources (e.g., China, South Korea, India, South Africa, Turkey, and Mexico) and a 2% increase in imports to the United States from less carbon-intensive sources (Canada and the European Union). However, a relative difference tax of 0.9% (the highest proposed rate of the Foreign Pollution Fee Act) under the same circumstances would lead to an 82% decrease in imports to the United States from more carbon-intensive sources and a 9% increase in imports to the United States from less-carbon intensive sources. No domestic carbon fee was included in this analysis, and the report assumes that domestic manufacturing would fill the product void from lost imports.

A CBAM program would create an economic opportunity for U.S. producers. The steel industry could see an $8.5 billion increase in domestic markets, with aluminum closely following at $6 billion in newly claimed production by 2030. Additionally, the shift to domestic production would likely create an estimated 30,000 jobs in the steel and aluminum industries annually.

Under a CBAM, the shift of manufacturing back to the United States could encourage energy efficiency in the industrial sector, since the fewer emissions the sector generates, the harder it would be for foreign companies to compete and reduce their CBAM fees. At EESI’s Clean Manufacturing in America briefing, panelist Nora Wang Esram, now the CEO at New Buildings Institute, explained how the industrial sector’s energy usage has doubled in the past 70 years, and an estimated 50% of the energy consumed in industrial applications is lost through waste heat. Certain industries are considering electrification, industrial heat pumps, and thermal heat batteries to increase efficiency. Esram noted that complexity, competition, and cost are three barriers to entry for new, more efficient technologies and retrofitted systems. A CBAM policy could not only encourage reduced carbon intensity of the industrial sector globally, but also help adapt U.S. supply chains and promote investments in clean and efficient equipment and facilities here at home.",,N,,2025-05-30 17:08:55.555711

WASHINGTON — The Department of the Interior today announced the implementation of emergency permitting procedures to expeditiously review geothermal energy projects critical for U.S. national security and Energy Dominance. This action is part of the Department’s efforts to address the national energy emergency declared by President Donald J. Trump on January 20, 2025.

By streamlining environmental reviews, the Department aims to accelerate geothermal projects that address urgent national security and energy needs while maintaining environmental stewardship.

“Geothermal energy is a reliable energy source that can power critical infrastructure for national security and help advance energy independence,” said Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum. “By cutting red tape and advancing President Trump’s American Energy Dominance agenda, we’re fast-tracking reliable energy projects while strengthening national security and supporting American workers.”

Several proposed geothermal projects led by Ormat Nevada, Inc. will be among the first geothermal projects covered by the Department’s new emergency permitting procedures:

Diamond Flat Geothermal Project (near Fallon, Nevada) – Ormat plans to drill test wells and conduct geothermal resource confirmation activities on federally leased land to determine whether the geothermal reservoir is commercially viable.

McGinness Hills Geothermal Optimization Project (Lander County, Nevada) – This effort involves upgrading and expanding three existing geothermal power plants by adding new wells, advanced heat exchangers, cooling fans, and a 15 MW solar photovoltaic field. These improvements aim to increase efficiency and boost output beyond the current 193 megawatts.

Pinto Geothermal Project (near Denio, Nevada) – Ormat is evaluating geothermal potential on leased public lands through test drilling and exploration activities.

These proposed projects pursue the kind of reliable and strategically important energy development the Department seeks to accelerate—supporting both national defense and domestic energy resilience. Once the Bureau of Land Management completes its environmental assessments within a 14-day timeframe, it will determine whether Ormat’s proposed projects can move forward.

The Bureau of Land Management oversees geothermal development on federal lands by leasing sites to companies, conducting environmental reviews, and issuing permits for exploration and production. The bureau ensures projects comply with environmental and safety standards, balances geothermal development with other land uses and manages royalties from operations. Essentially, BLM manages and regulates geothermal resources to promote responsible energy development on public lands.

The Department is using emergency authorities under existing regulations for the National Environmental Policy Act, National Historic Preservation Act and the Endangered Species Act. Interior has prepared a list of frequently asked questions pertaining to the emergency procedures. Project proponents interested in requesting emergency coverage should contact their regular points of contact at the pertinent field, district or state office.

Broadcast version by Isobel Charle for Washington News Service reporting for the WorkingNation-Public News Service Collaboration

As with many cities and towns, if an economy doesn't change with the times, opportunities for work and personal growth can stagnate. Change is crucial.

Historically, the industries of Spokane, Washington were natural resources-related, including mining and timber. ""It's modified over the years to a place where health care, health sciences, and education are really a big part of what we have in the city,"" says Mayor Lisa Brown.

""We have a very diversified economy,"" adding that what she calls 'emerging sectors' - aerospace, tech, and clean energy - are also fueling expansion.

Located in eastern Washington, Spokane has a population of 230,000. About 81% of Spokane's population identifies as white alone, 7.8% as Hispanic or Latino, 2.9% as Asian alone, 2.7% as Black alone, and 1.3% as American Indian and Alaska Native alone, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.

Brown says the area is dominated by the baby boomer generation, but the evolving economy is making Spokane more appealing to a younger population. She says goals for expanding housing, being mindful around land use, and ensuring a good transit system means, ""We can be a more attractive, affordable place for young people.""

Brown assumed her mayoral role in 2024, for a term that runs through 2027. Among her previous roles, she was chancellor of Washington State University Spokane, a state legislator, and director of the Washington State Department of Commerce.

She is using her past experiences in education, government, and business development to pull together a coalition of community thought leaders who are connecting local residents to career opportunities with the goal of building a strong economy.

An even bigger goal is putting residents on the pathway to economic mobility and prosperity.

Exploring Careers at a Young Age

""I describe us as 'infrastructure builders.' We think about the types of things, the conditions that need to be created for us all to be successful 10 years from now, for the economy to grow, and for us all to prosper,"" says Erin Vincent, VP of education and talent at Greater Spokane Inc. (GSI) - the region's business development organization.

GSI notes, ""We can't do this work alone. We partner with local businesses, our community, nonprofits, and the surrounding region to build a robust regional economy.""

Vincent says, ""In my area of workforce development, that means working on childcare. It means working on career-connected learning, thinking about how we can create the conditions for students to think about whatever their best future might be from that postsecondary perspective. It means supporting K-12 education.""

She says young students are getting a glimpse at the idea of careers in a variety of ways, including through career fairs, members of industry visiting schools, and education-focused programming on a local television outlet.

""Whether it's trades, apprenticeships, two-year, four-year, any of those options are great options. They are right for a lot of kids,"" says Vincent. ""The real key is that idea of creating an atmosphere of valuing whatever best suits a student.""

Experiential Learning Introduces Students to Potential Careers

A GSI initiative - Business AfterSchool - gives local students in grades 6-12 the chance to ""gain real-life skills and experiential learning in a workplace setting.""

Vincent says, ""In terms of a mindset perspective, there's probably no better way to actually get a kid to start seeing themselves as X, Y, Z than to actually get them there."" She says about 12 host businesses participate in Business AfterSchool during the academic year.

Vincent says one such business is Wagstaff, Inc., a longstanding partner that brings students in-house to observe various jobs on the manufacturing floor.

The manufacturing workforce pipeline needs a boost, according to Wade Larson, Wagstaff's director of workforce development.

""We did a study for Department of Commerce in the state about three years ago on the workforce for advanced manufacturing and aerospace. Bottom line - we don't have the numbers.""

He says bringing students to Wagstaff for Business AfterSchool is a valuable in-person experience, ""'I need you to come see us. Do cool stuff.' The idea is to capture some of these kids when they come out of high school.""

A more in-depth Wagstaff experience is the Production & Manufacturing Institute (PMI) - a three-week summer immersion program for incoming high school juniors and seniors.

""The students work as product teams to design, manufacture, and sell actual products for customers,"" explains Larson. ""In the meantime, we'll teach 'em a little bit of welding, a little bit of machining, take 'em out to live sites. And through this whole thing, they get to make money. They get to make stuff. They have a full experience.""

He says a lot of effort is made collecting feedback from the students and teacher participants - what they like and don't like, how the experience can be enhanced.

Helping Local Schools Shape Curriculum

Larson notes challenges faced by educators - not being able to always teach what's needed by industry. ""We're not telling the schools what we need. The schools are doing their best to figure it out themselves, but we in business need to step up, take the lead, throw money at it, and step into the classroom to say, 'Here we are. Let us help.'""

The Spokane Public Schools - which offers CTE (career and technical education) programming - states, "" With rising tuition costs, many high school graduates are looking toward trade apprenticeship programs as satisfying alternative career paths.""

Courses are available for both middle and high school students. The district says, ""Middle school CTE courses are exploratory, covering STEM, video production, and publishing.

""In high school, all courses are categorized into one of the 16 nationally recognized Career Clusters, which group jobs and industries by related skills or products/services. Courses typically progress from exploratory to preparatory stages, offering opportunities such as dual credit (college credit), industry certifications, internships, or apprenticeships.""

Opportunities for Advanced Manufacturing

Aerospace and tech are among the sector shifts in Spokane mentioned by Brown. The region's American Aerospace Materials Manufacturing Center (AAMMC) is expected to be ""critical to advancing U.S. economic and national security by onshoring and upscaling manufacturing technologies that support our domestic aircraft supply chain.""

Brown says, ""We have been awarded a significant stream of funding - upwards of $40 million. I will say that this is something that has broad sector support. We've got bipartisan senators supportive of this. So, we're cautiously hopeful that our funds are secure and that we really can make these key investments to build out the vision.""

The AAMMC already has a designated location at a former Triumph aerospace facility, notes Brown. ""This is not just a concept on a piece of paper. There's a facility. There is a set of workforce certificates being developed at the higher ed level and the set of collaborations around how to potentially engage in a scale-up of some manufacturing.""

She says, additionally, the facility will require advanced-level research and a test bed for next-generation materials to see if they're appropriate for the aerospace sector.

""This Tech Hub really brought stakeholders across the workforce system together because the capacity is there. We need everybody.

""We need the colleges, we need the K-12 system, we need the Workforce Councils, and the other training partners,"" says Shana Peschek, executive director of the Machinists Institute - the nonprofit arm of IAM District 751 (International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers).

""That's really where we see ourselves, especially around helping people understand what these careers are.""

Peschek says about the Tech Hub, ""We are leasing a small footprint there. We had a meeting to talk about what exact skills they would want us teaching around those materials - composites and thermal plastics.

""The partnership means that we'll have students in the building where this amazing facility is operating, really being innovative, and a global leader - and the employers and manufacturers have access to individuals from the region that are being skilled-up in that technology.""

Aside from the Tech Hub, the Institute has been involved in skills training for a number of years. Established in 2018, the Institute offers a pre-apprenticeship program called Machinists Institute Career Accelerator (MICA), as well as six Registered Apprenticeship pathways including machinist, industrial machinery technician, and fabrication welder.

Peschek notes in addition to aerospace and advanced manufacturing, other industries are under the Machinists' umbrella including maritime, clean energy, and supply chain.

The Institute is currently expanding its own current training and education center in Spokane. Expected to launch in July, Peschek says the offerings will include welding, machining, and heavy equipment/diesel.

Postsecondary Education Collaboration

Collaboration with community colleges has been highly productive, according to Peschek. ""Our machinist apprentices can get an associate degree at the same time that they journey out.

""We've been really breaking down barriers because we really want our students to understand that this degree, whether they felt like they needed one or not, it's there in the future - just in case - and helps open advanced pathways for them.""

She says Spokane Community College (SCC) has been an important partner.

Brown adds, ""We support people moving into the trades through apprenticeships. And now pre-apprenticeships. Through pre-apprenticeships and apprenticeships, we're also trying to create pathways into more specialized training.""

In order to help get qualified applicants into an apprenticeship program, SCC offers an apprenticeship prep course - Skilled Trades Preparation (STP), explains Kenna May, the school's manager of apprenticeship.

STP runs for 11 weeks, 24 hours per week. May says in addition to spending three hours per day in the shop, students learn extensively about workplace safety.

She notes, ""They also build a tiny house - all the components for that house. They do the blueprints, the framing, the drywall, the roofing. They'll put in doors and windows. They'll run electricity to them. Our goal is to really teach them a little bit about a lot of different trades.""

May notes that about 50% of the students that complete STP will move to a Registered Apprenticeship program - compared to the statewide articulation average of about 38%.

Regarding apprenticeship, she says, ""It's a combination of on-the-job training and classroom time. The college is the classroom portion of apprenticeship. Less than 10% of actual apprenticeship training is in the classroom.

""The majority of the training is done on the job. Our programs vary in length between two and five years, depending on the craft.""

May says the five-year programs include those pathways for electricians, sheet metal workers, plumbers, and steam fitters. Laborers and bricklayers are shorter programs.

She notes SCC's Apprenticeship and Journeyman Training Center is made available for use by several other programs that do not have their own training facilities - at no cost. Overall, SCC partners with 19 different programs representing about 27 trades, according to May.

When someone expresses interest in a particular pathway, May says, that person is referred to the specific program to apply. The program - not SCC - leads the process. ""You do testing in their interview process, then once they accept you in their program - they'll get you a job and put you out to work. Then they give a schedule to the students for when they're going to be coming in for class,"" she explains.

May reminds apprenticeship is dependent upon the economy. ""Our programs are not going to take apprentices if there's not a job for them. Our programs do look to the future of jobs coming up and try to anticipate how many they're going to need.""

Entry into the Trades for People with Barriers to Employment

The Pre-Employment Preparation Program (PEPP) is a hands-on pre-apprenticeship course - that consists of 160 hours over four weeks.

""We work with the building trades and all of our students who graduate with their certifications have a designated benefit of direct entry into the trade that they feel they want to do the most,"" says Shannon Corrick, PEPP's executive director.

According to PEPP, the program encourages ""disenfranchised individuals or those who are working low-wage jobs to apply for the PEPP class.

""We are also working closely with the criminal justice system to assist as many individuals as possible to enroll in PEPP immediately upon reentering the community so that they can be prepared to enter a family-wage apprenticeship position following completion of their PEPP class.""

Corrick notes that wraparound services are a key PEPP component. ""We can take care of their housing for a month. We can take care of their power bill for a month, their phone bill, their internet bill, their car payment, and then daycare, absolutely 100% daycare.

""We like to say it's not a handout, it's a hand up.""

Participants who complete the training earn certifications including OSHA 10, flagging (traffic control), CPR, and forklift qualification credential.

Corrick says trainees have had success transitioning into the trades, ""As far as our grants and our North America's Building Trades Unions (NABTU) certification, we are required to have 15% placements. That's our bare minimum. I do know from the September class, we have a 60% placement rate.""

Health Care Pathways

Brown says, ""We're not known necessarily as a health sciences city, but we have this health sciences cluster.""

""One in five people in Spokane County works in health care. It's our largest industry,"" says Erin William Hueter, executive director of Health Sciences and Services Authority (HSSA) of Spokane County. ""Our focus is on biosciences economic development and the promotion of public health. And we do that mostly through grantmaking,""

Williams Hueter says, ""So, connection to that research and growing that field is beneficial to the health of the residents of our region. But also, these are well-paying jobs. When we have people that are earning a good income and have a stable base in their economic lives, their health improves because they have access to health care in new ways.

""I think what's important about the development of really innovative technologies, innovative practices in health care, when you're in a community where so many of us work in health care and every single one of us is impacted by the health care delivery system - seeing that job growth, seeing new people being trained in that area, it's just critical to our wellbeing.""

As a former chancellor at Washington State University Spokane, Brown says, ""When I was at WSU Spokane, we created the state's second public medical school. So now we actually have both the University of Washington and WSU Medical School.""

Williams Hueter adds the organization - through its grant awards - is addressing the area's provider shortage, particularly how long it takes to see a primary care doctor. ""Contracts have been signed addressing provider shortages. So, we've got organizations that are addressing it through working to train more professionals.""

Grant recipients include Asante Health, Joya Child and Family Development Center, Latinos En Spokane, and Maddie's Place .

""What an incredible resource to have two medical schools in our region because - boy, do we need health care providers. Not just in Spokane County, but in the more rural areas that surround Spokane County, as well. Seeing those doctors stay in the area is so important,"" says Williams Hueter.

Pacific Northwest University - which has an osteopathic medicine program and is based in Yakima - also has a presence in Spokane.

Traci Couture Richmond, executive director of Spokane Teaching Health Center (STHC), explains, ""We are training family medicine and internal medicine residents. They've graduated from medical school. They now have come to their residency. And so, in Spokane, we are responsible for developing the next primary care workforce here.""

She also addresses the need for these doctors, ""What you're seeing is people are being forced into urgent cares, in emergency rooms to take care of issues that they're having - in settings that are not appropriate. That could be prevented by access to primary care.""

In addition, Couture Richmond says Psychiatry Residency Spokane - which is affiliated with both the University of Washington and Washington State University - has its outpatient clinic located at STHC.

""Their residents are here embedded with our internal medicine and family medicine residents. They're able to learn from each other.""

Couture Richmond says not everyone is comfortable seeing a resident for treatment, ""Residency clinics have kind of a quiet stigma - 'I don't want to go there because they're not real doctors.' And they are. They're doctors that are learning. You're also being seen by one of their preceptors who's been a physician for a long period of time.""

Upon completion of their residencies, a number of doctors remain in Spokane or rural communities outside of the area, she notes.

""Of our internal medicine program, we're retaining about 55 to 60% of those in the Spokane area. Many in internal medicine, typically they go off to be a hospitalist or then they move into a critical care fellowship.

""Family medicine has been a little bit of a different story for us. We have retained around 20%, but the other large group of them are going out into small rural communities and practicing the medicine that they were trained to do. From birth to death, they're doing all of that care in these small rural communities.""

The Emerging Clean Energy Sector

Brown says, ""There's really interesting stuff happening in clean energy. I mean, we have this river and waterpower. We've developed solar and wind in eastern Washington, and that has led to now looking at batteries and things like that.""

Spokane has a number of environmental initiatives around renewable energy, urban forestry, and stormwater and wastewater, among others. The local Water Department owns and operates the Upriver Hydroelectric Dam on the Spokane River.

""The basic idea is that the climate crisis continues to get worse and institutions like Gonzaga University have a real clear sense of our mission which involves graduating students who are people - for and with others - who want to create a just society and have care for a common home,"" explains Brian G. Henning, Ph.D., director of the Gonzaga Institute for Climate, Water, and the Environment.

The Gonzaga Climate Institute ""engages in regional capacity building, scholarship, and teaching to promote the flourishing of Inland Northwest communities, waters, and lands in the face of a changing climate.""

Henning says the school offers a BA in environmental studies, a BS in environmental science, as well as a sustainable business minor in the School of Business. ""Those are the programs that are most obviously connected to understanding different aspects of the environment, and we get really amazing students in all of those programs.""

Gonzaga offers career resources for students who complete these areas of study for post-university life.

There are hiring opportunities for students while they are still in school, according to Henning. ""The Climate Literacy Project was one of our very first projects. We started hiring Gonzaga students who serve as climate literacy fellows.

""They're typically environmental studies or environmental science students, but they could be from any discipline. We train them and they go in pairs into K-8 classrooms, and they deliver hands-on climate science lessons.""

He says some of the program's fellows have gone on to pursue environmental education as a career - for example, working for nonprofits in different parts of the country or for the [National] Park Service.

For learners anywhere, Henning says there is the opportunity to earn a professional certificate in climate action planning. He says, ""That program is available to community members from around the world who are interested in helping their communities develop plans for how to understand, how to be resilient, and how to reduce their contributions to climate change.""

Additionally, the Gonzaga Climate Institute created the Climate Resilience Project in 2022 in ""response to the increasing need for extreme heat research and community action."" Henning says, ""We hire students who are climate project assistants...who work 10 to 15 hours a week. They're doing research, they're doing community engagement, they're helping to coordinate and facilitate the combination of those two.""

Due to the threat of wildfire and the resulting smoke, Henning says they are ""developing heat and smoke response plans with the City of Spokane.""

He also mentions the Cataldo Project - which he describes as ""a curriculum and pedagogy workshop that Gonzaga faculty from any discipline can take.

""They come for a two-day workshop to explore how they can incorporate climate and sustainability concepts into their courses, their existing classes - not so much by dislodging content - but by infusing sustainability and climate themes.""

'Where is our village for our parents?'

As the conversation between Brown and WorkingNation was wrapping, she made a point to add, ""I'm very passionate about pre-K and early learning.

""I think a lot of it starts there. And the community is also coming together collaboratively around that sector and around childcare workers and people who are in early learning They need to be supported in order to get this whole thing off the ground right from the very beginning.""

""I really dug my heels into this idea of being a tool of healing and safety for the community, but also to focus on the education of early learners and to ensure that they were kindergarten-ready,"" says Kerra Bower, owner of Little Scholars Development Center and founder of Raze Development. ""We really started building our program to ensure that we closed the education gap as much as we possibly could.""

The programming serves children from four months to 12 years.

""The Maasai tribe asks that question, 'How are the children?' The idea is if the children are well and our community is well, then we are thriving,"" says Bower.

""My question has been, and will always be, 'Where is our village? Where is our village for our parents?' It is incredibly important. In all my programs, across the board, they're built on this idea that the parent is the cornerstone teacher. We are there to support the parent because if the parent is healthy and whole, then we're raising whole healthy humans.""

Bower says she first met Brown when she was with the Washington State Department of Commerce. ""One of the things I said to her [around childcare] was, 'This is a workforce development issue. This is an economic vitality and upward mobility issue. If you don't have a stable childcare environment and industry, you don't have workforce development or economic vitality.'""

After winning her run for mayor, Brown appointed Bower to her transition team. Bower says, ""She could have very well put me into the family engagement and family connection group, which is a very important group.

""But instead, she put me in the workforce and economic development group. I was the only childcare provider, and I would even venture to say the only actual small business in that group. For me, it really pinpointed her understanding.""

Bower says in addition to parents and their children, the teachers and caregivers need support, as well. ""We have to be able to provide a balance for them, and that comes in the form of the mental and behavioral health supports that are readily available to them in their classrooms.

""These are human beings. These are not childcare whisperers. They're not super humans. They are people who just happen to love little people. It's humanizing the individuals that are in your classrooms.""

'Quality of life-focused'

""I want the city to grow and thrive for my son, for my grandson, and for the future,"" says Brown. ""We're the second largest city in Washington State. The region is very quality of life-focused.""

An unsuccessful bid for Congress caused a shift in Brown's perspective. ""It got me even more connected to the region, to the city. I felt like the change that I wanted to see - if I couldn't help make it happen at the national level - that really here was the right place.""

She acknowledges that she is not doing the work alone. ""The best part of this job is that really I deeply engaged and networked. I know higher ed leaders. I know business leaders. I know nonprofit leaders, activists, and so that has made it easier for me.""

Wrapping Up The shift in Canadian EV market share, with GM surpassing Tesla in the first quarter of 2025, underscores the dynamic nature of the electric vehicle revolution.","The electric vehicle landscape in Canada has witnessed a significant power shift in the first quarter of 2025. General Motors (GM) has surged ahead of Tesla in overall EV sales, marking a dramatic turn in a market that many previously considered to be firmly in Tesla's grasp. This remarkable feat comes on the back of a staggering 252% year-over-year increase in GM's electric vehicle sales, fueled by a compelling lineup of new and increasingly popular models. The vehicles leading this charge are the highly anticipated Chevrolet Equinox EV, the robust Silverado EV, and the stylish Cadillac OPTIQ.

This surge in GM's EV sales contrasts sharply with the fortunes of the former Canadian EV sales leader, Tesla. In a stunning reversal, Tesla experienced an 87% drop in sales, plummeting from 5,097 units in the fourth quarter of 2024 to a mere 534 units in the first quarter of 2025. This precipitous decline points to a confluence of factors that have seemingly impacted the brand's appeal and market position in Canada.

Factors Behind Tesla's Sales Plunge

Several elements appear to have contributed to Tesla's significant sales drop in Canada. One key factor is the suspension of both federal and provincial electric vehicle incentives. Canada's Incentives for Zero-Emission Vehicles (iZEV) program, which offered up to CA$5,000 in federal rebates, paused indefinitely on January 12th, 2025, after allocated funds were fully exhausted. Additionally, Quebec's Roulez vert program, a significant provincial incentive, also saw a temporary suspension. The removal of these financial incentives has undoubtedly made EVs, including Teslas, less accessible to a wider range of consumers, impacting overall sales volumes.

Beyond the economic factors, the actions and public persona of Tesla CEO Elon Musk, particularly his alignment with the current US administration, appear to be taking a toll on the brand's reputation and consequently, its sales in Canada. Marketing experts suggest that Musk's outspoken political views have alienated a significant portion of potential buyers who may not align with his stance. In a market like Canada, which often holds distinct political and social views compared to the US, such brand association can have a tangible impact on consumer preferences.

GM's Winning Strategy: Diverse Lineup and Neutral Stance

In contrast to Tesla's challenges, GM's success in Canada seems to stem from a combination of a more diverse EV lineup and a more politically neutral public image. The Chevrolet Equinox EV, with 1,892 units sold in Q1 2025, led GM's charge GM takes over as the '#1 EV seller' in Canada - Electrek. This affordable electric SUV caters to a broad segment of the market looking for a practical and cost-effective EV option. The Silverado EV, with 894 units sold, taps into the popular pickup truck segment, offering an electric alternative to a traditionally gasoline-dominated category. Finally, the Cadillac OPTIQ, with 615 units sold, provides a compelling entry point into the luxury EV market for the GM brand. This diverse portfolio allows GM to appeal to a wider range of buyers with varying needs and preferences.

While direct evidence linking GM's political neutrality to its success in China is less quantifiable, anecdotal observations suggest that in politically sensitive markets, a less overtly political stance can be beneficial. GM has maintained a relatively low public profile regarding contentious political issues, focusing instead on its products and its commitment to the Chinese market. While GM has faced challenges in China, with an overall sales decline in the previous year, there were signs of rebound in the fourth quarter. This suggests that GM's strategy of focusing on its vehicle offerings and maintaining a less polarizing public image may be resonating with consumers in key markets like China, mirroring its current success in Canada.

Wrapping Up

The shift in Canadian EV market share, with GM surpassing Tesla in the first quarter of 2025, underscores the dynamic nature of the electric vehicle revolution. While the suspension of government incentives has undoubtedly played a role, Tesla's significant sales decline also points to the potential impact of brand perception and the actions of its leadership. GM's success, on the other hand, highlights the strength of a diverse EV lineup that caters to different segments of the market, coupled with a potentially advantageous neutral political stance, which may also be contributing to their performance in other significant global markets like China. This Canadian snapshot serves as a compelling reminder that in the rapidly evolving EV landscape, product diversity, market sensitivity, and even the perceived neutrality of a brand can be crucial factors in achieving and maintaining market leadership.

Without direct pay, VBS and the MVHC would have struggled to install solar panels and reap their full benefits.
The clean energy from solar panels offsets the relatively expensive energy from the power grid, resulting in long-term reductions in energy costs.
“From a financial and an environmental point of view, it was worthwhile to install the solar panels,” said Diamond.
“The solar panels are helping us get rid of fossil fuels as we used the savings from the solar panels and installed a heat pump to replace the propane-fueled furnace.","Solar energy is increasingly popular among faith-based institutions. Recently, two synagogues, thousands of miles apart but with similar economic and environmental commitments, have installed solar arrays on their buildings. In California, the Valley Beth Shalom (VBS) synagogue installed 425 kilowatts’ (kW) worth of solar panels to lower energy costs, increase sustainability, and provide an educational opportunity to the community.1 With similar purposes in mind, the Martha’s Vineyard Hebrew Center (MVHC) in Massachusetts installed 75 solar panels, providing 30 kW of energy, in 2023.

Both VBS and the MVHC took advantage of direct pay, the monetization of clean energy tax credits for nonprofits. Until 2022, only organizations with a tax liability could access clean energy tax credits; nonprofits and tax-exempt entities were locked out from claiming such credits when installing solar panels or other clean energy measures. Thanks to the elective pay (a.k.a. direct pay) option introduced by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) (P.L. 117-169), these entities can claim tax incentives when investing in clean energy projects, such as solar energy, ground-source heat pumps, and battery storage devices. These small-scale renewable energy projects enable lower energy bills and increased resilience and can help create quality contractor and installation jobs, generating local wealth and spurring further demand for these distributed technologies.

Without direct pay, VBS and the MVHC would have struggled to install solar panels and reap their full benefits. Direct pay is a game-changer because it gives nonprofits access to the same financial incentives that for-profit companies have received for years when investing in renewable energy. As the monetization of a tax credit, direct pay is not a point-of-sale rebate or a federal grant.

Federal tax credits are handled by the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), so nonprofits seeking to claim direct pay must complete IRS Forms 3468 and 3800, along with their 990-T tax returns. They must file them the year after the eligible clean energy project is “put into service.” Depending on when the clean energy project was installed and placed into service and when the tax return was filed, the entire process can take anywhere between four and 18 months.

In March 2025, the MVHC received the base 30% direct pay payment for its solar array installation, which was put into service last year.2 While most organizations can expect to claim between 30 and 50% of a project’s costs, if the law’s bonus credits are stacked, they can claim up to 70% of the total cost of domestically-sourced projects located in low-income communities. There is no limit to the number of eligible projects a nonprofit can claim direct pay for in a single tax year.

VBS and the MVHC are not alone in pursuing environmental and financial stability by installing solar panels on their buildings. According to a 2023 federal report, places of worship had installed more than 2,500 solar systems by the end of 2021, representing approximately 170 megawatts (MW) of capacity—enough to power more than 28,500 households for one year. With these solar installations, houses of worship collectively avoid 236,000 tons of CO2 emissions a year, equivalent to removing nearly 50,000 cars from the road. Now that houses of worship can benefit from the same tax credits afforded to commercial businesses, their solar installations are expected to accelerate considerably.

Valley Beth Shalom Installs Solar Panels to “Repair the World”

Driven by sustainability, community, and financial considerations, Valley Beth Shalom completed the installation of 868 Q-Cell rooftop solar panels this month, making it the largest solar array installation in a California synagogue and one of the largest for a synagogue in the entire country. Informed by Jewish environmental values, VBS installed solar panels on almost every square foot of the 130,000-square-foot roof of the main building on its five-acre campus in Encino, California. Working with Sunistics Group, which designed the solar installation, VBS initiated construction of the solar array in December 2024.

The 425 kW solar array is expected to save the synagogue approximately 614,552 kWh annually, equivalent to $180,014. By generating clean energy locally, VBS will replace 80% of the energy it currently sources from the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, VBS's local utility. While 43.4% of the utility’s energy mix comes from renewable sources (e.g., solar, wind, geothermal, and hydroelectric), 42.7% still comes from fossil fuels, such as natural gas and coal.

Installing solar panels is a financially viable investment for nonprofit organizations like VBS. Energy costs are the second-highest operational expense for many nonprofits, behind only salaries. The clean energy from solar panels offsets the relatively expensive energy from the power grid, resulting in long-term reductions in energy costs. At VBS, the savings will be invested in educational programs and hands-on learning opportunities for students and families in the community, advancing environmental stewardship and empowering the next generation to embrace sustainability. VBS will develop programs centered around the installed solar panels to educate the community about renewable energy and the connection between sustainability and Jewish values.

The total cost for the solar array installation reached $1.2 million, including inverters. VBS received several grants, low-interest loans, and donations from the community to finance the solar panels. Through the Jewish Solar Challenge, VBS received a $150,000 grant in 2023. In that same year, VBS secured a $100,000 zero-percent interest loan from the Adamah Climate Action Fund, a loan program run by Adamah, a national Jewish climate organization that VBS is a member of. Additionally, as a nonprofit organization, VBS will apply for direct pay this year, once the panels are put into service, to recoup at least 30% of the project costs.

""Everything that we do at Valley Beth Shalom revolves around tikkun olam, or ‘repair the world’,"" said Matthew Weintraub, executive director at VBS. “We are good stewards of the environment, an integral part of our Jewish values. We focus on spending money and energy on things that make an impact on the community.”

Martha’s Vineyard Hebrew Center

Looking to make a significant contribution to its community amid high electricity rates, the MVHC decided to install solar panels. The center completed a 76-panel 30 kW array in May 2023 and put it into service in July of that year. The total cost for the solar array installation was $76,000. The 30 kW solar array is already saving the MVHC hundreds of dollars annually, which they used to install a new heat pump in place of their old propane-fueled furnace.

“In 2022, we installed solar panels in our house, and we wanted to do the same for the Hebrew Center,"" said Ricky Diamond, the first vice president of the MVHC. “We are a small community with 324 members, with many concerned about climate change and how to get off fossil fuels. We saw solar panels as a way to do good for the environment, the community, and save money on our utility bills.”

As a nonprofit organization, the center filed for a 30% direct pay disbursement for its solar panels in June 2024 through IRS forms 990-T, 3800, and 3468. Due to the novelty of the direct pay process, Ricky and his wife Batya had difficulty finding an accountant who was familiar with the required paperwork for nonprofits seeking clean energy credits, so they filed themselves. After months of back-and-forth with the IRS, the MVHC received a check for $24,405.85 in March 2025, representing 30% of the solar project’s costs, plus interest from the IRS for issuing the direct pay payment late.

As a tax-exempt house of worship, Martha’s Vineyard Hebrew Center was never obliged to file tax returns with the IRS. But because direct pay credits are processed through an organization’s tax return, the center had to file a tax return in 2024, the year after its eligible clean energy project was put into service, to claim its credits. The Hebrew Center will not need to file tax returns in subsequent years, unless it claims credits for future projects.

Through its communications with the IRS, the MVHC discovered that, as a first-time tax filer, it could determine the starting month of its tax year without being tied to the calendar year. Given that the clean energy system was fully commissioned with its local utility in July 2023, Martha’s Vineyard Hebrew Center decided to start its tax year that month, and end it in June 2024.

“From a financial and an environmental point of view, it was worthwhile to install the solar panels,” said Diamond. “The solar panels are helping us get rid of fossil fuels as we used the savings from the solar panels and installed a heat pump to replace the propane-fueled furnace. We are slowly becoming energy independent.”

The U.S. Bureau of Land Management appears to be promoting the polluting of mountain views with supposedly green energy. Multiple pages on bureau’s website for siting wind energy on public lands show the same photo of dozens of wind turbines blocking the view of snow-covered mountains.

“Renewables are booming” proclaims a November 2024 headline on the Sierra Club website, right above a picture of a sunset blocked by wind turbines.

The page for “Renewable Energy” from the Union of Concerned Scientists boasts of “little or no pollution” and then provides a photo of wind turbines filling a mountain pass.

The Natural Resources Defense Council website promotes a photo of dozens of wind turbines filling the scenery underneath a snow-capped mountain. The caption reads: “Limiting dirty fossil fuel production and transitioning to clean energy, like wind and solar, are critical in building a livable future.”

Inherent Hypocrisy

Though unintentional, this cheerleading is an honest portrayal of two serious and hypocritical problems inherent in weather-dependent energy systems:

They must devour a lot of land—otherwise known as “the environment” that the environmental groups claim to be conserving.

The windy and sunny land (and ocean frontage) these systems need are often the same open spaces humans enjoy looking at and living near.

A 2021 analysis from Bloomberg News, titled “The U.S. Will Need a Lot of Land for a Zero-Carbon Economy,” came to this conclusion:

Wind farms, solar installations and other forms of clean power take up far more space on a per-watt basis than their fossil-fuel-burning brethren. A 200-megawatt wind farm, for instance, might require spreading turbines over 19 square miles (49 square kilometres). A natural gas power plant with that same generating capacity could fit onto a single city block. [emphasis added]

The Bloomberg report provided this graphic to explain that getting comparable wattage from wind requires 370 times more land than natural gas, and that solar needs 140 times as much land:

As shown above, obtaining electricity from carbon-free nuclear power is also far gentler on land use than wind and solar. Bloomberg provided this commentary:

Natural gas and nuclear energy are very compact power sources. A conventional 1-gigawatt reactor operating on 1,000 acres produces the same power as a wind farm spanning 100,000 acres.

For perspective, 100,000 acres is the equivalent of 156 square miles—or a hunk of the Earth larger than major cities such as Detroit, Michigan.

Similarly, the U.S. Department of Energy reached this conclusion:

Despite producing massive amounts of carbon-free power, nuclear energy produces more electricity on less land than any other clean-air source. A typical 1,000-megawatt nuclear facility in the United States needs a little more than 1 square mile to operate . . . you would need more than 3 million solar panels to produce the same amount of power as a typical commercial reactor or more than 430 wind turbines.

Large corporations and growing startups were caught up in the decision.

Energy secretary Chris Wrights said the moves were “due diligence” on the part of the Trump administration. His statement did not cite specific reasons why the projects were canceled, but pointed to a memorandum he issued on May 15, which suggests that the department may attempt to use its audit powers to rescind the awards.

In total, 24 projects are affected by the move, including ones being developed by oil and gas giant Exxon Mobil, food manufacturer Kraft Heinz, industrial heat startup Skyven, cement and alumina startup Brimstone, and cement startup Sublime Systems.

Here’s a sampling of some of the awards in jeopardy:

American Cast Iron Pipe Company (metal manufacturing): $75 million

Exxon Mobil’s Baytown Olefins Plant (chemical plant): $331.9 million

Skyven Technologies (heat pump steam generation): $15.3 million

Sublime Systems (low carbon cement): $86.9 million

Sublime told TechCrunch that it was caught off guard.

“Sublime was surprised and disappointed to receive the news about the termination of our Industrial Demonstrations Program award, given the clear progress we’ve made in scaling our American-invented technology, partnering with some of the Western World’s largest cement producers, and generating a bankable customer base,” spokesperson Rob Kreis said via email. The startup is evaluating its options to continue scaling up its operations.

On April 25, 2024, Toyota confirmed plans to produce “an all-new, three row battery electric SUV” at its plant in Princeton, Indiana. While the name or the exact launch timeline was not confirmed, we’re expecting this vehicle to be ready in 2026, and it could be called the Highlander Electric.

Produced alongside the combustion model at the same facility, this three-row SUV aims to cater to families seeking an all-electric alternative to the Highlander and Grand Highlander. Competing with the likes of the Kia EV9 and Hyundai Ioniq 9, we expect a circa-55k USD starting price.

7. 3-Row SUV from Kentucky

Toyota’s second family SUV will come from its facility in Georgetown, Kentucky, where the company is investing USD 1.3 billion, with production now slated to begin in 2026. The “all-new, three row battery electric SUV for the U.S. market,” confirmed on February 6, 2024, is expected to be designed to meet the growing demand for larger electric vehicles, complementing the Highlander EV.",https://topelectricsuv.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Toyota-bZ4X-steering-wheel-live-image.jpg,N,,2025-05-30 16:10:38.378850

Many of the canceled projects focused on carbon capture or low-carbon cement.
17 of the canceled projects are from the Industrial Demonstrations Program, which aims to support the decarbonization of heavy industries like steel, cement, and aluminum.
The announcement comes less than a month after Secretary of Energy Chris Wright testified before Congress that no OCED cut lists existed.
BACKGROUND According to Bloomberg, the cuts include funding to Heidelberg Materials and Sublime Systems for pilot projects to manufacture low-carbon cement.","WASHINGTON, DC — Following a pattern of cutting federal programs led by Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), the Department of Energy (DOE) today announced it was canceling $3.7 billion in funding for 24 clean energy projects through its Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations (OCED).

The announcement comes less than a month after Secretary of Energy Chris Wright testified before Congress that no OCED cut lists existed.

In response to the news, the Sierra Club’s Industrial Transformation campaign issued the following statements:

“DOGE and the Trump Administration have just killed dozens of major investments in American competitiveness, good jobs, and cleaner air to support Trump’s tax cuts and line the pockets of billionaires. These projects were not just pro-climate; they were pro-jobs, pro-innovation, and pro-public health. American workers, fenceline communities, and forward-thinking companies have had the rug pulled out from under them,” said Iliana Paul, deputy director for the Industrial Transformation campaign at the Sierra Club.

“As part of the agreement for receiving the grants, companies were all required to engage with the community and address some of the biggest concerns that local residents had with the project. These included pollution and public safety concerns, alongside hiring local workers and investing in programs that would benefit local residents. By pulling the plug from 24 projects, the Trump administration and DOGE are taking away efforts that would support the wellbeing and economic vitality of manufacturing communities. This is a betrayal of public trust,” said Yong Kwon, senior advisor for the Industrial Transformation campaign at the Sierra Club.

BACKGROUND

According to Bloomberg, the cuts include funding to Heidelberg Materials and Sublime Systems for pilot projects to manufacture low-carbon cement. Earlier this week, Sublime announced it had signed an agreement with Microsoft to buy more than 600,000 tons of its low-carbon cement — which calls into question the Trump administration’s argument that the canceled projects were not “economically viable.”

Interestingly, the cut list did not include funding to Cleveland Cliffs for a project to transition its coal-reliant steelmaking processes to hydrogen — despite the fact that the Cleveland Cliffs CEO said in May that it would use the money to instead reline the blast furnace at its Middletown, Ohio facility to extend their lifespan and continue their reliance on coal — which is clearly outside of the original scope of OCED funding for clean energy projects.",https://www.sierraclub.org/sites/default/themes/custom/bootpt/favicon.ico,N,,2025-05-30 15:21:40.477302

The tax credits, bolstered in the landmark climate bill passed under former president Joe Biden in 2022, are crucial for boosting renewable technologies key to the clean energy transition. E2 estimates that $132 billion in plans have been announced since the Inflation Reduction Act passed, not counting the cancellations.

“The House’s plan coupled with the administration’s focus on stomping out clean energy and returning us to a country powered by coal and gas guzzlers is causing businesses to cancel plans, delay their plans and take their money and jobs to other countries instead,” E2 Executive Director Bob Keefe said.

The U.S. Senate is now reviewing the bill with an informal July 4 deadline to get it to the president’s desk.

What Has Been Cancelled

Some of the most recent cancellations include the Kore Power battery factory in Arizona and BorgWarner’s closure of two EV manufacturing sites in Michigan. Bosch suspended a $200 million investment in a hydrogen fuel cell factory in South Carolina, citing changes within the market over the past year in a statement to The Associated Press.

Tariffs, inflationary pressures, nascent company struggles, and low adoption rates for some technologies may also have been reasons for these companies’ plans changing. For instance, the battery storage and electric vehicle sectors have seen the most impact in 2025, with the latter especially having had had a difficult past few years. Several projects spurred by the IRA were also cancelled prior to 2025.

Georgia and Tennessee are particularly at risk because they are highly invested in EV and battery production, said Marilyn Brown, an energy policy professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology who was not involved in the analysis.

“If all of a sudden these tax credits are removed, I’m not sure how these ongoing projects are going to continue,” said Fengqi You, an engineering professor at Cornell University who also was not involved.

A handful of Republican lawmakers have urged the continuation of energy tax credits, with some saying in an April letter to Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) that a repeal could disrupt the American people and weaken the county’s position as a global energy leader.

The U.S. on the Global Stage

The Trump administration has sought to dismantle much of Biden’s environmental and climate-related policy, withdrawing again from the Paris climate agreement, rolling back countless landmark pollution regulations and environmental initiatives, dismissing scientific findings supporting climate action, blocking renewable energy sources, and more in an effort to bolster a fossil fuel-led “American energy dominance” agenda.

Meanwhile other countries are proceeding with green investments. The European Parliament is committing to the European Union Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), a policy meant to prevent “carbon leakage,” or companies moving production to countries where climate policies are less strict. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has proposed to include a CBAM in the new trading relationships his new government plans to negotiate with more reliable international partners.

The International Maritime Organization is moving toward a global carbon tax on shipping, AP says, though the IMO’s record for delivery on its climate promises has been shaky at best.

In a sign that not all hope is lost for the future of renewables in the U.S., April alone saw nearly $500 million in new development, with Japanese manufacturing company Hitachi’s energy arm building out transformer manufacturing in Virginia and materials and technology company Corning investing in solar manufacturing in Michigan. Across the U.S., 24 Democrat-led states representing 50% of the country’s population and 60% of its GDP are recommitting to reducing their climate pollution and carrying on the energy transition.

But they can’t do it all on their own, and $4.5 billion in development was cancelled or delayed last month alone, according to E2’s tally.

This ends critical clean energy industrial policy support about five years ahead of schedule.
This uncertainty, combined with uncertainty surrounding tariff rates and enforcement, has led to a growing number of cancelled projects and factories.
E2 said $14 billion in clean energy projects and 10,000 jobs have been cancelled in 2025.","The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022 kicked off a 10-year clean energy industrial policy in the United States, but it is now under threat of having core elements repealed via the “Big, Beautiful Bill” that has been approved by the House of Representatives and next faces a vote by the Senate.

Unprecedented announcements in U.S. clean energy followed the 2022 law. E2 tracks these announcements in its Clean Economy Works report. Since the IRA was passed, over 390 clean energy projects in 42 states representing over $130 billion in investment and 120,000 jobs have been announced, according to the report.

However, if the Senate passes the budget resolution as-written, core elements of the IRA, including the Investment Tax Credit and Production Tax Credit, will be repealed for projects not placed in service by 2028. This ends critical clean energy industrial policy support about five years ahead of schedule.

This uncertainty, combined with uncertainty surrounding tariff rates and enforcement, has led to a growing number of cancelled projects and factories. E2 said $14 billion in clean energy projects and 10,000 jobs have been cancelled in 2025. About $4.5 billion in cancellations occurred in April alone, said E2.

“Now is not the time to raise taxes on clean energy and compound the business uncertainty that is clearly taking a greater and greater toll on U.S. manufacturing and jobs,” said Michael Timberlake, director of communications, E2.

What’s more, most of the cancelled investments occurred in Republican districts. Democratic House members unanimously voted against the budget bill, but it was approved by a razor-thin majority due to strong Republican support.

More than $12 billion in investment and 13,000 jobs have been cancelled in Republican voting districts thus far, said E2. Through April, over 61% of all clean energy projects announced—along with 72% of all jobs and 82% of all investments —are in congressional districts represented by Republicans.

“Businesses are now counting on Congress to come to its senses and stop this costly attack on an industry that is essential to meeting America’s growing energy demand and that’s driving unprecedented economic growth in every part of the country,” said Timberlake.

Tax credits for geothermal energy would be reduced by 20% each year starting in 2029 ahead of a 2031 sunset.

The cost of a U.S. House of Representatives bill to abruptly sunset clean energy tax credits could be significant in New York.

U.S. Sen. Charles Schumer said the impact of the bill could reach a loss of more than 20,000 jobs and endanger $5 billion in clean manufacturing investments. It’s also expected to increase energy costs for American households by as much as 7%, while increasing pollution.

It’s also ceding ground in the renewable market to China, Schumer said, which produces a majority of the world’s solar panels and increased its solar capacity to 880 gigawatts in 2024. The bill passed the House in May and is now working its way through the U.S. Senate.

The $5 billion in investment coming to New York in wind, solar, battery, electric vehicle and other clean manufacturing was tied to Inflation Reduction Act funding.

“If they eliminate those tax credits, study after study shows we’ll have fewer companies coming here,” Schumer said. “Projects will be dramatically scaled back and up to 20,000 jobs would be lost in construction and manufacturing.”

Business and individual incentives from the Inflation Reduction Act, including electric vehicle tax credits, are on the chopping block in the House bill.

Tech-neutral electricity tax credits have been the most affected, requiring a quick-turn on projects or risk losing funding. The House bill would require:

Repeal of credits for projects starting construction more than 60 days after enactment

Projects beginning within the 60-day period must be in service by Dec. 31, 2028.

The changes would exempt nuclear projects from the 60-day requirement, but would still need to be in service by the 2028 deadline.

Changes to solar credits for your home panels

It would also specifically eliminate credit for leased residential solar installations for any taxable year beginning after enactment. Tax credits for geothermal energy would be reduced by 20% each year starting in 2029 ahead of a 2031 sunset.

Schumer blamed the fossil fuel lobby on the House vote in favor of the bill, despite the growing demand for electricity and the low startup costs of renewables like solar.

“The fossil fuel industry knows their days are numbered because the new kinds of clean power are … not only cleaner, but cheaper and quicker to implement,” the senator said. “And so they want to kill this industry just as it’s really getting started and causing job growth. That’s a damn disgrace.”

Schumer said he’s a supporter of bipartisan efforts to reform permit approvals for grid lines and pipelines to get energy from renewable energy installations to where people live.

“It’s too hard to build these power lines right now,” Schumer said. “So there’s bipartisan hope to pass this permitting reform and the tax credits go hand-in-hand with permitting reform.”","https://www.democratandchronicle.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2024/07/03/PROC/74290070007-sd-070224-hub-6.jpg?crop=4033,2267,x0,y240&width=3200&height=1799&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-05-30 15:21:14.702517

Oracle has announced plans for a gigawatt-scale data center powered by three SMRs, currently in the design phase.","In a decisive step toward reshaping the energy backbone of its AI-driven infrastructure, Google has deepened its commitment to nuclear power through a strategic partnership with Elementl Power. The tech giant will support the early-stage development of three advanced nuclear energy sites from Elementl across the United States, each designed to deliver a minimum of 600 megawatts, for a combined capacity of 1.8 gigawatts.

Announced in early May, the agreement marks another inflection point in Google’s broader strategy to secure scalable, carbon-free baseload power capable of supporting the exponential energy demands of AI-centric data centers. The partnership also signals the sector's growing confidence in advanced nuclear technologies as a viable path to long-term sustainability and energy resilience in digital infrastructure.

Founded in 2022, Elementl Power aims to deploy over 10 gigawatts of advanced nuclear capacity by 2035. Google’s investment will fund key early-phase activities including site permitting, regulatory engagement, and commercial structuring. The backing of a hyperscale player like Google gives Elementl a formidable launch pad—and underscores the intensifying race among tech giants to lock in low-carbon power at scale.

As AI workloads push data center energy requirements to unprecedented levels, nuclear—once viewed as peripheral—is emerging as a cornerstone of next-generation power procurement strategies. With this move, Google isn’t just planning for the future; it's building it. The three Elementl facilities are expected to come online before the end of the decade, positioning Google to lead in deploying utility-scale nuclear energy for digital infrastructure.

Upon completion, Google will have the option to purchase power from these facilities. Amanda Peterson Corio, Global Head of Data Center Energy, Google, reflecting on the importance of these types of investments, said:

Elementl Power Steps Into the Spotlight as a New Nuclear Catalyst

Founded just three years ago, Elementl Power is a relative newcomer to the nuclear energy landscape—but one with outsized ambition and strategic intent. Co-founder and President Ryan Mills describes the company as a purpose-built platform to address a critical industry gap: catalyzing private capital formation to accelerate advanced nuclear projects.

According to Elementl’s mission statement, the company aims to bridge the divide between nuclear technology providers, utilities, and major energy buyers—entities increasingly seeking long-term, carbon-free baseload power as AI infrastructure scales globally.

While Elementl has yet to disclose detailed leadership bios or a track record of past projects, its high-profile partnership with Google is a significant validation. Beyond the investment itself, the collaboration gives Elementl a marquee partner and a proving ground for its “technology-agnostic” strategy—allowing it to source the most promising reactor designs tailored to individual site and grid requirements.

That flexibility may prove critical as the advanced nuclear sector works to commercialize a new generation of reactor technologies over the next decade.

With industry targets converging on the 2030–2035 window for the first wave of commercial deployment, Elementl’s ten-year runway is ambitious—but not implausible. Traditional nuclear development timelines often stretch 15 to 20 years; Elementl’s modular, adaptable approach offers a pragmatic counterpoint. Success will depend on navigating evolving regulatory frameworks, aligning with state-level energy policies, and keeping pace with innovation from a growing cohort of advanced reactor vendors. For Elementl, nimbleness may be as important as engineering.

Google’s Nuclear Playbook Extends Beyond Elementl

The Elementl deal builds on Google’s expanding footprint in nuclear innovation. In October 2024, the company signed a Master Plant Development Agreement with Kairos Power, a California-based startup focused on developing small modular reactors (SMRs) using fluoride salt–cooled high-temperature reactor (FHR) technology. The agreement calls for the deployment of a fleet of Kairos reactors providing up to 500 megawatts of clean energy by 2035—an effort aimed squarely at meeting Google’s growing data center power demands with carbon-free baseload generation.

The first Kairos reactor is slated to go online by 2030, although full commercial deployment may extend several years beyond that. Still, the agreement marked a historic milestone: the first corporate commitment to procure energy from a network of SMRs, signaling a broader shift in how hyperscalers approach long-term energy procurement. Microsoft and Amazon have also engaged with next-gen nuclear developers through letters of intent, underscoring the rising stakes—and fierce competition—around securing future-proof power for data center growth.

Kairos Power, spun out of U.S. national laboratory and university research, has taken an iterative, vertically integrated approach to bring FHR technology to market. A key milestone came in December 2023, when the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission approved a construction permit for Hermes, the company's low-power demonstration reactor in Oak Ridge, Tennessee.

This was the first construction permit granted for a non-light-water reactor in the United States in more than 50 years. Construction began in July 2024, and by May 2025, the first safety-related concrete was poured—marking real progress on what could be a pivotal commercial validation.

Backed by the U.S. Department of Energy’s Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program, Kairos believes it is on track to commercialize its reactor platform in the early 2030s. If successful, projects like Hermes could shift the economics and timelines of nuclear deployment across the data center industry—transforming how digital infrastructure is powered in an era of escalating AI workloads and decarbonization mandates.

U.S. Nuclear Momentum Accelerates Amid Policy Shifts and Hyperscale Demand

Google’s nuclear partnerships with Elementl Power and Kairos Power underscore a broader resurgence in U.S. nuclear energy—driven by hyperscale computing needs, evolving federal policy, and a maturing ecosystem of advanced reactor technologies.

In late May 2025, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission approved NuScale Power’s updated 77 MW small modular reactor (SMR) design, replacing its earlier 50 MW model. This milestone positions NuScale to potentially deploy its first SMR by decade’s end, contingent on securing a customer. Notably, NuScale is reportedly in discussions with five major data center operators, reflecting the sector’s growing interest in SMRs as scalable, carbon-free energy solutions.

Concurrently, President Trump’s administration has enacted a series of executive orders aimed at revitalizing the nuclear industry. These directives mandate expedited reactor licensing processes, authorize development on federal lands, and promote domestic uranium production. The policy shift has reportedly invigorated investor confidence, with companies like Oklo, Centrus Energy, and BWX Technologies experiencing significant stock gains.

The Department of Energy (DOE) is also advancing initiatives to bolster nuclear capacity. A comprehensive roadmap aims to add 35 GW of new capacity by 2035, with an annual addition of 15 GW by 2040. This plan includes repurposing existing power plant sites and transitioning coal plants to nuclear facilities.

In the private sector, tech giants are increasingly integrating nuclear energy into their infrastructure strategies. Amazon has partnered with Dominion Energy and X-energy to develop 5 GW of nuclear capacity, while Microsoft is exploring the revival of the Three Mile Island site for data center power.

The jury is still out on whether the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) has helped contain or reduce inflation. Nevertheless, certain provisions have delivered tangible benefits that deserve closer examination before any potential repeal. While some provisions may not have broad appeal, one success of the IRA has been its impact on strengthening U.S. energy production. The bill speaks more to renewable energy innovation and increase in energy independence to support U.S. economic growth than to direct economic impact. Repealing it wholesale risks far more than we might anticipate.

At its core, the IRA tax credits for energy generation are driving significant investment in innovative energy production. Because renewable energy makes up around 21.4% of the energy mix, these incentives have been passed down the chain to the benefits of the ratepayer, while simultaneously sustaining the creation of entire industries. These investments have sparked construction and manufacturing jobs across both red and blue states, proving that clean energy isn’t just an environmental initiative.

These tax credits have also bolstered America’s energy independence. Renewables like solar, onshore wind and offshore wind are integral to our domestic energy supply chain, reducing reliance on foreign sources, and making our own infrastructure more resilient. They’ve also driven initiatives to improve long-term cost competitiveness, incentivizing developers to innovate to reduce costs.

Our current grid infrastructure and energy generation systems are nearing obsolescence and over the next decade the demand on these systems is expected to skyrocket. Data centers alone are expected to double their electricity demand, and by 2035, over 71 million electric vehicles will require around 400 kWh to charge per month. Urbanization trends are compounding this demand as more people move to cities.

Without the IRA tax credits, we risk slowing down our ability to develop more power generation, growing the risk of rolling blackouts and higher energy costs for the average ratepayer, all while increasing our dependence on foreign sources of energy. Today’s decisions don’t impact today’s costs, they impact tomorrow’s ability to grow our economy.

Tax credits are not a new concept — they have been a bipartisan policy tool used for decades to support emerging technologies. From artificial intelligence and quantum computing, to biotechnology, to government investments driving technologies like GPS and the Internet, these investments have repeatedly demonstrated their value. Renewable energy is no exception.

Since the IRA has been enacted, the renewable energy industry has created thousands of jobs and established numerous domestic manufacturing plants on U.S. soil spurred by these domestic supply tax credit incentives. Manufacturing isn’t the only business reaping these benefits either. These credits have helped support better-paying jobs in specialized professions such as those in the maritime industry for offshore wind or wind technician positions.

Energy diversity isn’t just good economics — it’s a good security policy. With a diverse mix of energy sources (nuclear, fuel based, hydro, renewable), we reduce the risk of monopolies that drive up costs, as seen with Standard Oil’s monopoly in the early 20th century. Competition forces developers to lower costs, driving the cost of energy downwards. Furthermore, the energy has to come from somewhere and the question is not about the current costs of renewable energy but the future cost of energy in general to consumers without renewables in the energy mix of the future. There is nothing more damaging than energy you need but can’t find.

From a national security perspective, energy diversification mirrors a sound investment portfolio. Just as diverse assets protect against market volatility, multiple energy sources safeguard against physical and cyber threats. If one source is cut off, others can fill the gap, ensuring a stable energy supply and reducing our reliance on adversarial nations for critical resources. Not only are we safer from attack, but we are also responsible for our own generation. This further helps reduce costs, but also prevents us from being beholden to other countries, especially our adversaries, for energy and tangential resources such as rare minerals.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/Hv8PCyQkZi0Q_aXEa5Bbam_cDvRz6BlNQ8WwJzkdND8/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0xNDEyMTQ2Mzg2LmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-05-30 15:21:20.748405

Challenges were filed by Colorado’s Eagle County and several environmental organizations. The Court reversed and remanded the D.C. Circuit Court’s decision that found “numerous [National Environmental Policy Act] NEPA violations arising from the EIS.”1

The 88-Mile Railroad Line

The Board, which reviews applications for new railroad lines, approved a proposal by a group of seven Utah counties (the Seven County Infrastructure Coalition) for the construction and operation of an approximately 88-mile railroad line in northeastern Utah. The line would connect Utah’s oil-rich Uinta Basin to the national rail network and would facilitate the transportation of crude oil from Utah to refineries in Louisiana, Texas, and elsewhere.

The Board’s Extraordinarily Lengthy EIS

The Board prepared what the Court referred to as “an extraordinarily lengthy EIS, spanning more than 3,600 pages of environmental analysis” addressing the environmental effects of the railroad line pursuant to NEPA. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit faulted the EIS for not sufficiently considering the “environmental effects of projects separate from the railroad line itself.” The D.C. Circuit Court ruled that the environmental effects that should have been addressed in the EIS included these separate projects:

Increased oil drilling upstream in the Uinta Basin; and

Increased oil refining downstream along the Gulf Coast of Louisiana and Texas.

Holding that the agency’s NEPA analysis was flawed, the D.C. Circuit vacated the Board’s EIS and the Board’s approval of the 88-mile railroad line. That decision further delayed the railroad’s construction even though the Board approved the project nearly four years earlier in December 2021.

Substantial Judicial Deference Required in NEPA Cases

Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh delivered the unanimous 8-0 opinion of the Court2 ruling that:

First, the D.C. Circuit did not afford the Board the substantial judicial deference required in NEPA cases.

Second, the D.C. Circuit ordered the Board to address the environmental effects of projects separate in time or place from the construction and operation of the railroad line.

But NEPA requires agencies to focus on the environmental effects of the project at issue.

Under NEPA, the Board’s EIS did not need to address the environmental effects of upstream oil drilling or downstream oil refining. Rather, it needed to address only the effects of the 88-mile railroad line. And the Board’s EIS did so. (Emphasis added.)

Upstream Oil Drilling and Other Speculative Projects Need Not Be Analyzed

The Court ruled that the Board’s decision was correct that analysis of the environmental effects of upstream oil drilling was not needed emphasizing that the project at issue was an “88-mile railroad line, not an oil well or a drilling permit in the Uinta Basin.” (Emphasis added.)

In addition, the Board possesses “no authority or control over potential future oil and gas development” in the Basin. Future projects would be “subject to the approval processes of other federal, state, local, and tribal agencies.”

The environmental effects of future oil and gas development in the Basin are “speculative” and attenuated from the project at hand.3

NEPA is Purely Procedural – an Agency’s Role – a Court’s Role

Justice Kavanaugh emphasized the need to distinguish the agency’s role from the court’s role. Courts should “defer to agencies’ decisions” about where to draw the line for:

How far to go in considering indirect environmental effects from the project at hand; and

Whether to analyze environmental effects from other projects separate in time or place from the project at hand.

Thus, agencies possess discretion and must have broad latitude to draw a “manageable line.”4

In an attempt to “tie all this together,” Justice Kavanaugh states:

When assessing significant environmental effects and feasible alternatives for purposes of NEPA, an agency will invariably make a series of fact-dependent, context-specific, and policy-laden choices about the depth and breadth of its inquiry – and also about the length, content, and level of detail of the resulting EIS.

Courts should afford substantial deference and should not micromanage those agency choices so long as they fall within a broad zone of reasonableness.

As the Court has emphasized on several occasions, and we doubly underscore again today, “inherent in NEPA . . . is a ‘rule of reason,’ which ensures that agencies determine whether and to what extent to prepare an EIS based on the usefulness of any new potential information to the decision making process.”5 (Emphasis added.)

Delay Upon Delay – the Process Seems to “Border on the Kafkaesque.”

The Court’s critique of the history of NEPA implementation will perhaps reign in the extremes that project proponents have witnessed since President Nixon signed NEPA into law on January 1, 1970 – over 56 years ago. In his review, Justice Kavanaugh criticizes the tendency for agencies to engage in analysis of separate projects that address:

more consideration of attenuated effects, more exploration of alternatives to proposed agency action, more speculation and consultation and estimation and litigation. (Emphasis added.)

He cites the 1978 U.S. Supreme Court decision in Vermont Yankee: “Delay upon delay, so much so that the process sometimes seems to “borde[r] on the Kafkaesque.”6

And further:

A 1970 legislative acorn has grown over the years into a judicial oak that has hindered infrastructure development “under the guise” of just a little more process. . . .

A course correction of sorts is appropriate to bring judicial review under NEPA back in line with the statutory text and common sense. . . .

Congress did not design NEPA for judges to hamstring new infrastructure and construction projects.

On the contrary, as this Court has stressed, courts should and “must defer to ‘the informed discretion of the responsible federal agencies.’”7

The D.C. Circuit Was Wrong on the Merits of NEPA

Beyond requiring that courts defer to the informed discretion of the agency, the majority then addresses the failings of the D.C. Circuit Court’s rulings on the merits under NEPA stating:

The D.C. Circuit erroneously required the Board to address environmental effects from projects that are separate in time or place from the 88-mile railroad project at hand – that is, effects from potential future projects or from geographically separate projects. Moreover, those separate projects fall outside the Board’s authority and would be initiated, if at all, by third parties.

And to ensure that the reader understands the value of footnotes in the Court decision, footnote 5 deserves particular consideration:

Even though not mandated by NEPA to do so, the Board did identify some of the potential effects and marginal risks from projects separate from the 88 miles of additional railroad track in rural Utah. See, e.g., App. 354-358 (forecasting the number of oil wells that could be added in the Uinta Basin as a result of increased production spurred by the new railway); id., at 420-423, 539-542 (evaluating effects from increased oil refining along the Gulf Coast).

The Board should not necessarily earn bonus points for studying more than NEPA demanded. But it should definitely not receive a failing grade just because its 3,600-page EIS was less thorough in analyzing the effects from other projects than the Court of Appeals might have preferred. (Emphasis added.)

In summary:

The proper judicial approach for NEPA cases is straightforward. Courts should review an agency’s EIS to check that it addresses the environmental effects of the project at hand.

The EIS need not address the effects of separate projects.

In conducting that review, courts should afford substantial deference to the agency as to the scope and contents of the EIS.

The Sotomayor Concurrence – the Agency’s Organic Statute and Case Precedent Control

Associate Justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson joined Associate Justice Sonia Sotomayor in her concurring opinion that took a different approach to reach the same conclusion as the majority. The concurring Justices relied on (1) the organic statute pursuant to which the agency acts (here the Interstate Commerce Commission Termination Act, 49 U.S.C. §11101) and (2) earlier Court precedent. Agreeing that the D.C. Circuit Court’s decision was wrong, Justice Sotomayor states:

[U]nder its organic statute, the Board had no authority to reject petitioners’ application on account of the harms third parties would cause with products transported on the proposed railway. The majority takes a different path, unnecessarily grounding its analysis largely in matters of policy.

Justice Sotomayor reviewed the Board’s organic statute and confirmed the Board’s understanding of the scope of its review and the factors the Board must address in reviewing applications by project proponents stating:

As common carriers, railroads subject to the Board’s jurisdiction are required to provide ‘transportation or service on reasonable request’ to any person or commodity.” (49 U.S.C. §11101(a)). In addition, the Act contains a clear presumption in favor of approving new railways.

And of the 15 statutory policies the Board must consider in the exemption process, not one concerns the anticipated use of commodities that will be transported on the proposed railway. See §§10101(1)-(15).

Unlike the Board, meanwhile, other entities do have authority “to approve oil and gas development projects” and to regulate the effects of refining. . . . All this suggests, as the Board concluded, that the Board could not have rejected petitioners’ application in order to prevent the harmful effects of oil drilling and refining.

But the environmental respondents, although conceding that the Board correctly understood its authority to approve or disapprove a project application, argued that the Board should have analyzed environmental impacts that the Board could not lawfully prevent. Justice Sotomayor provided an unsympathetic dismissal of that argument concluding:

Public Citizen squarely forecloses that position. . . . Even a foreseeable environmental effect is outside of NEPA’s scope if the agency could not lawfully decide to modify or reject the proposed action on account of it. NEPA thus did not require the Board to consider the effects of oil drilling and refining.

Under NEPA, agencies must consider the environmental impacts for which their decisions would be responsible. Here, the Board correctly determined it would not be responsible for the consequences of oil production upstream or downstream from the Railway because it could not lawfully consider those consequences as part of the approval process. For that reason, I concur in the Court’s judgment reversing the D.C. Circuit’s holding requiring the Board to consider in further detail harms caused by the oil industry.

Cumulative Impacts or Effects?

Those of us in the midst of dealing with federal agencies and those agencies’ NEPA obligations related to our projects will search in vain for any reference in either the majority or concurring opinions for any reference to “cumulative impacts” or “cumulative effects.” So, will a review of the Seven County decision at least indirectly provide some useful guidance? Maybe.

The NEPA statute itself does not use the terms “indirect” or “cumulative impacts or effects.” However, it has been generally understood for over 50 years that NEPA’s requirement that an EIS should discuss “the relationship between local short-term uses of man’s environment and the maintenance and enhancement of long-term productivity” implies that the scope of an EIS is meant not only to consider the immediate effects of a project but also how a project might impact the environment in the long-term through indirect or cumulative effects with other projects.

Although NEPA does not use the terms explicitly, the regulations issued by the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) were the first to address federal agency responsibility to consider indirect and cumulative impacts and to document that analysis.8

And despite recent court decisions and the Trump Administration’s actions that eliminate the CEQ rules9, every federal agency (including the Surface Transportation Board) has promulgated their own NEPA regulations that require analysis of direct and indirect impacts in their environmental reviews.10

Consider the discussion above as a prelude to our interest in reviewing the Seven County decision to find further guidance as to whether and how federal agencies will now address “cumulative impacts” of our projects. The underlying facts of the case might appear to automatically involve the need to assess cumulative environmental impacts of constructing and operating a new rail line – impacts beyond “just” the rail line itself.

Indeed, what is the “need” for the rail line? The answer: oil development! Without the need to transport oil to the “main rail lines” and distant refineries, there is no need for the line. So, how does one disengage the impacts of one from the impacts of the other?

That’s exactly what the opponents of the rail line argued. For example, the Brief of Respondents Eagle County, Colorado and Center for Biological Diversity, et al in Opposition to Petition for Writ of Certiorari states in part:

Limiting agencies to effects that they directly regulate, rather than effects Congress has authorized them to consider, does not comport with NEPA’s purpose or rule of reason – “that agencies determine whether and to what extent to prepare an EIS based on the usefulness of any potential information in the decision-making process.”

Both the majority and concurring opinions limit the agency’s obligation, however, to a review of the application of the Seven Counties Infrastructure Coalition for an 88-mile railroad – not the arguably “cumulative impacts” and “indirect impacts” that might occur with further oil and gas development in the Uinta Basin. And it is the underlying “organic statute” that provides the authority for this particular agency to do anything that drives the result.

In sum, these are the factors that we, our project proponents, and the federal agencies involved must consider.

Has the federal agency undertaking the NEPA analysis acted within the scope of authority Congress provided in its “organic” statute?

Has the agency incorrectly considered projects that are separate in time or place from the proposed project?

Because the textual focus of NEPA is the “proposed action” – the project at hand – not other separate projects, has the agency gone too far in addressing those separate projects?

Has the agency addressed environmental consequences and feasible alternatives to the relevant project?

Is the agency’s final decision reasonably explained?

And finally, while indirect environmental effects of the project may fall within NEPA’s scope (even if they might extend outside the geographical territory of the project or materialize later in time), the fact that the project might foreseeably lead to the construction or increased use of a separate project does not mean the agency must consider that separate project’s environmental effects.

Among the 24 axed awards was a hydrogen energy initiative led by Exxon Mobil in Baytown, Texas, and several decarbonization projects for the cement sector and for the food and beverage industry, including the Kraft Heinz Co.

Of the canceled grants, only $99 million had gone out the door, DOE said. The majority of the contracts were signed by the Biden DOE after Donald Trump won the presidency last November, the department said.

DOE’s list shows award cancellations for projects that are mostly in Republican-leaning states — Texas, Louisiana, Wyoming, Ohio and Alabama — and for industries that have voiced support for Trump.

“The Trump administration is doing our due diligence to ensure we are utilizing taxpayer dollars to strengthen our national security, bolster affordable, reliable energy sources and advance projects that generate the highest possible return on investment,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a statement.

He added, “the previous administration failed to conduct a thorough financial review before signing away billions of taxpayer dollars.”

The department says it used a review process announced earlier this month to cancel the awards, deciding the grants “did not meet the economic, national security or energy security standards necessary to sustain DOE’s investment.”

Democratic lawmakers, environmentalists, energy efficiency groups and some manufacturing advocates panned the grant cancellations.

“We’re ceding ground to global competitors racing ahead in innovation and energy efficiency,” Rep. Marcy Kaptur (D-Ohio) said in a statement.

“The American people deserve leadership that meets the moment — not one that backs away from the challenge of a clean, affordable energy future. If the Trump Administration was looking to give Communist China everything they wanted, they are well on their way,” said Kaptur, the ranking member of the House Energy-Water Appropriations Subcommittee, which has jurisdiction over DOE.

The largest canceled awards are for carbon capture projects at cement plants. Heidelberg Materials received $500 million for a project, and the National Cement Co. of California won an award for the same amount.

An $189 million award for cement company Brimstone Energy was also canceled. Brimstone spokesperson Liza Darwin said the company believes the decision to cancel was based on a “misunderstanding,” given the “project’s strong alignment with President Trump’s priority to increase U.S. production of critical minerals.”

“Brimstone’s Rock Refinery represents the only economically viable way to produce the critical mineral alumina in the U.S. from U.S.-mined rocks,” Darwin said in a statement.

Erin Glabets, spokesperson for Sublime Systems, which had an $87 million cement grant canceled, said the company was “surprised and disappointed.”

Heidelberg Materials spokesperson David Perkins said in an interview, “DOE indicates this decision can be appealed.”

“We are in the process of evaluating this course as we consider our next steps,” he said.

Meanwhile, natural gas plants appear to be big targets for the cancellations.

Among DOE’s award cancellations is one for a gas-fired power plant in Kentucky, which DOE selected last February for a federal cost share of $72 million. The Cane Run Generating Station intended to install CCS and trap roughly 200 tons of carbon dioxide per day.

Power generator Calpine and its carbon capture projects also took a hit. On the list of cancellations was a $270 million award to Calpine Texas CCUS Holdings for the company’s project in Baytown, Texas.

A $332 million canceled award for Exxon Mobil was for a project that planned to swap out natural gas for hydrogen at a textile and plastic production site in Baytown. At the time of the Biden award announcement, DOE said the project would avoid 2.7 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions annually, along with roughly 200 tons per year of nitrogen oxide.

Exxon declined to comment.

Another axed award, for just over $49 million, was headed to a carbon capture pilot at the Wyoming Integrated Test Center, which is outside of the Dry Fork power station in Gillette, Wyoming. That award was also announced in February 2024.

Jessie Stolark, executive director of the Carbon Capture Coalition — a group that works to build policy support for greater deployment of carbon management technologies — said DOE’s decision to cancel awards is “hugely disappointing.”

“Businesses require certainty to plan and execute projects, and carbon management is no different,” Stolark said in a statement. “For decades, the United States has been the global leader in the development and deployment of carbon management technologies but moves like this risk ceding America’s energy and technological leadership to other nations. As the policy framework in other nations for carbon management continues to mature, we risk being left behind.”

Trump has pledged to revive American manufacturing with a sweeping package of import tariffs. Tariffs implemented under the president’s declared emergency last month are now stuck in a legal limbo, after a federal court decision Wednesday striking down the levies was followed by an appeals court allowing the tariffs to stay in place while appeals play out.

“This program could have been a centerpiece of achieving the administration’s goal to bring manufacturing back to the United States,” Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, said of the canceled DOE awards. “Locking domestic plants into outdated technology is not a recipe for future competitiveness or bringing manufacturing jobs back to American communities.”

Nadel called the DOE decision “shortsighted.”

EPA promotes carbon capture

DOE’s award terminations contrast with EPA efforts to speed up permitting of wells used to sequester heat-trapping carbon dioxide deep into underground formations.

Earlier this year, EPA granted top regulatory authority over Class VI wells, to the state of West Virginia. It also recently proposed granting that authority — called “primacy” — to Arizona for all six classes of injection wells, including Class VI.

“EPA received a complete Class VI primacy application from Texas on February 28, 2025,” EPA spokesperson Carolyn Holran said in a statement Thursday.

The agency “is working expeditiously to propose and then finalize this rulemaking. EPA’s goal is to support a timely and efficient primacy decision that protects groundwater resources and supports cooperative federalism,” Holran said.

The list didn’t include some of the largest projects — such as hydrogen hubs — potentially slated for cancellation at DOE’s Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, according to documents that have been circulating among DOE officials and lobbyists for weeks.

It’s possible that those other projects may be terminated later, as Wright has said DOE is conducting a broad review of projects to be completed this summer. According to the documents, four of seven hydrogen hubs funded with $7 billion from the bipartisan infrastructure law may be on the chopping block.

The 24 projects nixed Friday were on the circulating lists.

OCED also is facing a staffing plunge. More than 70 percent of employees have opted to leave the office voluntarily as part of a deferred resignation program. The department has not provided a final tally of how many resignation offers have been approved.

According to modeling from the environmental think tank Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, the closure of OCED could result in the loss of more than 290,000 jobs.",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/63/ae/f154bca745c494039412b11694bc/senate-energy-82284.jpg,N,,2025-05-30 15:23:43.684849

Businesses have canceled or delayed some $14-billion worth of clean energy projects just since January, alongside some 10,000 announced jobs, according to a new analysis by business and advocacy group E2. Furthermore, if Trump’s tax and spending bill passes into law, E2 anticipates steeper losses.

“If the tax plan passed by the House last week becomes law, expect to see construction and investments stopping in states across the country as more projects and jobs are cancelled,” E2 communications director Michael Timberlake said in a statement.

E2 tracks private investments and job creation that have been announced in the clean energy industry since the 2022 passage of the Inflation Reduction Act. The organization tallies projects in manufacturing, R&D, and electricity generation, as well as recycling, repair, and maintenance projects. Sectors E2 follows include batteries, EVs, hydrogen, semiconductors, solar, and wind. Since the bill’s 2022 passage, E2 notes some 390 projects, worth some $132 billion, have been announced, along with roughly 123,000 jobs.

E2 notes that Republican-run congressional districts have reaped the majority of benefits: 61 percent of projects, 72 percent of jobs, and 82 percent of investment. As a result, Republican districts are also taking a majority of the losses, to the tune of some $12 billion in project cancellations and 13,000 canceled jobs.

Some Republican lawmakers have begun sounding the alarm on the version of Trump’s bill that passed the House, which restricts the ability for clean energy producers of wind and solar to access credits but carves out exceptions for nuclear power, Politico reported last week. Five Senate Republicans told Politico they plan to consider changes to the House’s version of the bill, with Finance Committee member Senator Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) saying, “Undoubtedly, there’s going to be changes.”

Trump’s former top adviser, Elon Musk, has similarly expressed distaste with provisions in the bill that would at the close of the year terminate EV incentives worth up to $7,500—including for Tesla models. It’s a change in tune for the Tesla CEO, who previously seemed to endorse erasure of the incentives as beneficial to Tesla. Musk announced his official departure from White House duties on Wednesday.

Tesla’s energy division, which sells solar supplies and battery storage, is similarly at risk from the planned repeal of residential solar credits and phaseout of clean energy investment incentives.

Commenting on an X user’s post that referred to the bill’s removal of solar energy credits as “unjust,” Musk wrote, “There is no change to tax incentives for oil & gas, just EV/solar.”

Musk also shared a post from Tesla Energy, urging the Senate “to enact legislation with a sensible wind down” of credits for residential solar and low carbon electricity, rather than “abruptly ending the energy tax credits” in order to support grid integrity, domestic manufacturing, and AI.

What could change, however, is the permitting process for fossil fuel projects. The current version of Trump’s bill contains provisions seeking to streamline and expedite that process, Politico reported, but that component may not make it through the Senate.","https://img-cdn.inc.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit/vip/2025/05/trump-cuts-climate-tech-projects-inc.jpg",N,,2025-05-30 16:09:58.281386

Why buy a 2026 Cadillac Vistiq?","The Cadillac six-passenger Vistiq electric luxury vehicle is expected to have a 305-mile range on a charge.

With the Vistiq all-wheel drive is standard.

The question isn’t whether buyers will love Cadillac’s six-passenger 2026 Vistiq electric luxury SUV. They will.

The question is why it took Cadillac decades to build this baby Escalade ― easier than the massive original to park and helm through city traffic, but still packing the luxury, technology and sheer presence that’s made the Escalade an icon; arguably the most successful and important vehicle in Cadillac’s 122-year history.

Infusing the Escalade’s essence into a vehicle in the higher-volume midsize SUV segment seems obvious in retrospect, but Cadillac never tried. It built smaller SUVs, some very good, but none approached the Escalade’s status and swagger.

Honestly, though, who cares? The Vistiq rolling into Cadillac dealers now is such a natural fit for the brand that asking what took so long is the cheapest Monday morning quarterbacking. If you didn’t have the idea, you don’t get to call other people slow for not thinking of it sooner.

What matters is that the Vistiq has arrived, with the bravado, power and sheer heft that make the Escalade ― and the new Escalade IQ EV ― impossible to ignore in a market crowded with luxury and electric SUVs.

Built in Spring Hill, Tennessee, the Vistiq is on sale now. Prices run from $77,395 to $96,495, excluding a $1,695 destination charge.

What makes the Vistiq special?

Cadillac has bet big on EVs. They account for 23% of sales so far this year, with a target of 35% by year end.

The Vistiq’s calling cards are:

Road presence

Advanced features

Comfort

Style

Room

Big battery, good range, poor charging transparency

A midsize three-row SUV with six or seven seats, the Vistiq plays in one of the most popular vehicle segments.

All-wheel drive from a pair of electric motors is standard. They produce 615 hp and 650 pound-feet of torque that blast the SUV to 60 mph in 3.7 seconds.

A 102 kWh battery provides up to 305 miles range.

Cadillac continues GM’s refusal to quantify DC charging speed by the commonly used and easily understood, “xx minutes from 10%-80%” of battery capacity, but the Vistiq’s battery can accept 190kW current, adding “up to 79 miles in about 10 minutes.”

On the possibly naive assumption that GM’s acting in good faith, simple math suggests 10%-80% could be achieved in less than 30 minutes ― fast enough there’s no reason not to announce it.

When reality just isn’t good enough

An advanced new augmented reality system projects navigation information ― including arrows floating in front of the Vistiq to indicate turns ― and alerts. New optics make the display, which appears to be projected in space 10 meters in front of the Vistiq, clearer and more effective than earlier AR systems.

The Vistiq is one of a handful of vehicles that uses active noise cancellation to reduce road noise from the tires and suspension. That’s particularly welcome given that its electric drivetrain eliminates many sounds and vibrations that mask those noises in internal combustion vehicles.

Driving impressions

The Vistiq drives like a smaller vehicle. That’s a very good thing, particularly for a vehicle that can haul six or seven adults in comfort. The optional four-wheel steering tightens its running radius and enables quick, stable maneuvers at highway speed.

Why buy a 2026 Cadillac Vistiq?","The Cadillac six-passenger Vistiq electric luxury vehicle is expected to have a 305-mile range on a charge.

With the Vistiq all-wheel drive is standard.

The question isn’t whether buyers will love Cadillac’s six-passenger 2026 Vistiq electric luxury SUV. They will.

The question is why it took Cadillac decades to build this baby Escalade ― easier than the massive original to park and helm through city traffic, but still packing the luxury, technology and sheer presence that’s made the Escalade an icon; arguably the most successful and important vehicle in Cadillac’s 122-year history.

Infusing the Escalade’s essence into a vehicle in the higher-volume midsize SUV segment seems obvious in retrospect, but Cadillac never tried. It built smaller SUVs, some very good, but none approached the Escalade’s status and swagger.

Honestly, though, who cares? The Vistiq rolling into Cadillac dealers now is such a natural fit for the brand that asking what took so long is the cheapest Monday morning quarterbacking. If you didn’t have the idea, you don’t get to call other people slow for not thinking of it sooner.

What matters is that the Vistiq has arrived, with the bravado, power and sheer heft that make the Escalade ― and the new Escalade IQ EV ― impossible to ignore in a market crowded with luxury and electric SUVs.

Built in Spring Hill, Tennessee, the Vistiq is on sale now. Prices run from $77,395 to $96,495, excluding a $1,695 destination charge.

What makes the Vistiq special?

Cadillac has bet big on EVs. They account for 23% of sales so far this year, with a target of 35% by year end.

The Vistiq’s calling cards are:

Road presence

Advanced features

Comfort

Style

Room

Big battery, good range, poor charging transparency

A midsize three-row SUV with six or seven seats, the Vistiq plays in one of the most popular vehicle segments.

All-wheel drive from a pair of electric motors is standard. They produce 615 hp and 650 pound-feet of torque that blast the SUV to 60 mph in 3.7 seconds.

A 102 kWh battery provides up to 305 miles range.

Cadillac continues GM’s refusal to quantify DC charging speed by the commonly used and easily understood, “xx minutes from 10%-80%” of battery capacity, but the Vistiq’s battery can accept 190kW current, adding “up to 79 miles in about 10 minutes.”

On the possibly naive assumption that GM’s acting in good faith, simple math suggests 10%-80% could be achieved in less than 30 minutes ― fast enough there’s no reason not to announce it.

When reality just isn’t good enough

An advanced new augmented reality system projects navigation information ― including arrows floating in front of the Vistiq to indicate turns ― and alerts. New optics make the display, which appears to be projected in space 10 meters in front of the Vistiq, clearer and more effective than earlier AR systems.

The Vistiq is one of a handful of vehicles that uses active noise cancellation to reduce road noise from the tires and suspension. That’s particularly welcome given that its electric drivetrain eliminates many sounds and vibrations that mask those noises in internal combustion vehicles.

Driving impressions

The Vistiq drives like a smaller vehicle. That’s a very good thing, particularly for a vehicle that can haul six or seven adults in comfort. The optional four-wheel steering tightens its running radius and enables quick, stable maneuvers at highway speed. An air suspension that’s packaged with the 4WS (four-wheel steering) smooths rough surfaces and virtually eliminates body roll, squat and dive in enthusiastic driving.

And it’s hard not to drive enthusiastically in a vehicle that combines inherently quiet EV operation with active road-noise cancellation and plenty of acoustic insulation.

The order set off a panicked evacuation of staff and patients at the Al-Awda Hospital, which was the last functioning hospital in the region. Health officials say Israeli attacks on hospitals have killed more than 1,400 medical workers since October 2023.

On Thursday, Israeli attacks across Gaza killed at least 70 Palestinians; airstrikes since dawn today have killed a further 18 people, according to Gaza hospital officials. Al Jazeera reports Israeli troops shot and wounded 20 Palestinians trying to reach an aid distribution point set up by the controversial U.S.- and Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. It’s the third aid center set up by the group so far. The United Nations has said the foundation’s decision to open a handful of aid hubs exclusively in the south of the Gaza Strip puts civilian lives in danger and encourages mass displacement by using aid as “bait.”

Gaza’s food crisis continues to worsen, as the trickle of aid now entering the territory is far too little for its population of over 2 million people. This is Khawla Abu Zeitar, mother of an 11-month-old child suffering from malnutrition, who said she did not manage to get a meal after waiting in line at a soup kitchen in Gaza City Wednesday.

Khawla Abu Zeitar: “This boy is suffering from extreme malnutrition. … The average weight for his age is 12 kilograms. Now he only weighs 3.9 kilograms. He has been granted a medical evacuation 20 days ago, but I’m still waiting.”

On Thursday, the White House said Israel had agreed to a U.S.-crafted Gaza ceasefire proposal and that Trump’s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff had submitted it to Hamas. Drop Site News reports the deal includes a 60-day initial truce, a “redeployment” of some Israeli occupation forces, and an exchange of captives, including 10 living Israelis held in Gaza. It would also require the “immediate” delivery of humanitarian aid, including by the United Nations and the Red Crescent. Hamas officials said they were studying the deal, but a member of the group’s political bureau told Reuters the proposal in its current form would result in “the continuation of killing and famine” in Gaza.

Saudi Arabia’s defense minister warned leaders of Iran last month that they should accept President Trump’s offer to negotiate a new nuclear agreement with the U.S. — or face military action by Israel. That’s according to Reuters, which reports Saudi Prince Khalid bin Salman personally delivered the message that Trump’s team would want to reach a deal quickly, that the window for diplomacy would close fast, and that an Israeli attack was possible if the talks broke down. Khalid bin Salman’s visit to Iran in April was the first by a high-ranking member of the Saudi royal family in more than two decades.

A federal appeals court on Thursday temporarily reinstated Trump’s sweeping global tariffs, staying a decision by a trade court that had blocked those tariffs one day earlier after finding Trump overstepped presidential authority by invoking emergency powers. Prior to Thursday’s stay, another federal court, this time in Washington, D.C., had also blocked Trump’s tariffs. The case is expected to make its way to the Supreme Court. Trump’s trade war has roiled global markets and already cost companies $34 billion, according to Reuters. A number of smaller businesses have been forced to shutter. We’ll have more on this story with the Brennan Center’s Elizabeth Goitein later in the broadcast.

The founder of the private mercenary firm Blackwater is working with Haiti’s interim government on a plan to conduct lethal operations against the gangs that now control much of Haiti’s territory. The New York Times reports Erik Prince recently shipped a large supply of weapons to Haiti and is planning to send up to 150 mercenaries there this summer. Prince is reportedly part of a secret task force that has spent the past several weeks operating drones meant to kill gang members. A Haitian human rights group blames the drones for the deaths of over 200 people.

The daughter of a woman who died during the 2021 Pacific Northwest heat wave is suing seven oil and gas companies for her mother’s wrongful death. Juliana Leon died of hyperthermia, or overheating, as a “heat dome” choked the region and sent temperatures in Seattle skyrocketing to 108 degrees. Nearly 200 people died during the heat wave. The lawsuit is the first of its kind and accuses the fossil fuel companies of concealing their role in creating the climate crisis and failing to warn people of the dangers of their emissions.

This comes as a new report today found half the world population endured 30 additional days of extreme heat over the past year due to human-created climate change.

The Supreme Court has sharply limited the scope of the National Environmental Policy Act, a ruling that will accelerate the development of major infrastructure projects including highways, pipelines and liquefied natural gas export terminals. The court’s 8-0 ruling on Thursday will allow federal agencies conducting environmental reviews to take a more limited view of the impacts of major transportation and energy projects. Earthjustice said in a statement, “The Trump administration will treat this decision as an invitation to ignore environmental concerns as it tries to promote fossil fuels, kill off renewable energy, and destroy sensible pollution regulations.”

A court in Germany ruled against a Peruvian farmer who was seeking redress from the energy company RWE for its role in the melting of Andean glaciers, which has put the farmer and his community in Huaraz at risk of flooding. But climate activists are celebrating the ruling as a major victory, as the German court also found major polluters can be held responsible for the consequences of climate change, setting up a possible precedent as similar cases play out in other countries. This is German lawyer Roda Verheyen, who represented Saúl Luciano Lliuya in the landmark case.

Roda Verheyen: “But what is important is the legal obligation of companies like RWE has been established here today. The legal obligation to deal with the consequences of their actions and to bear responsibility for them is something that has never before been established anywhere in the world in this form.”

A major report on chronic health conditions by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was found to contain citations to nonexistent studies. According to the outlet NOTUS, the 73-page “Make America Healthy Again” document contains references to at least seven fabricated studies, while other studies are misinterpreted.

This comes as the Health Department has just canceled a $600 million contract with Moderna to develop mRNA vaccines protecting against flu subtypes which could develop into pandemics, including bird flu. RFK Jr. has expressed skepticism over mRNA technology, which was used in COVID vaccines that are widely credited with saving millions of lives and preventing millions of cases of severe disease.

Here in New York, a judge extended a temporary restraining order protecting Columbia University student Yunseo Chung from deportation until a hearing on June 5. Chung, a South Korean national, is a green card holder who has lived in the U.S. since she was 7. She’s been targeted by immigration authorities for participating in Palestinian rights protests at Columbia. Community members rallied in support of Chung as her lawyers appeared in court Thursday. This is Yunmi from the group Nodutdol.

Yunmi: “She’s being attacked because she has views that go against the Trump administration and their desires in Israel and also against the general ruling class. So, by persecuting her on also baseless grounds — there’s no evidence against her — who can say what the Trump administration and the federal government are willing to do next to anyone, regardless of their immigration status?”

The renowned Kenyan author, playwright and professor Ngũgĩ wa Thiong’o has died at the age of 87. Over six decades, he chronicled Kenya’s transition from a British colony to independence. Thiong’o’s work landed him in jail and in exile as he wrote searing criticisms of colonial rule, as well as the emerging independent state, which he accused of benefiting elites at the expense of Kenyan society. In 2010, Democracy Now! interviewed him in our studio after he’d just released his memoir, “Dreams in a Time of War.”

Ngũgĩ wa Thiong’o: “In all the settler colonies, like Kenya, Nigeria — not Nigeria — Kenya, South Africa and Zimbabwe — Mozambique is another example, Algeria is another example — independence was won through armed struggle. In all of those, there was armed liberation movements, and the land question was at the basis of the whole struggle. So, with Kenya, we had one of the earliest anti-colonial guerrilla movements. Ours was by the name of Mau Mau.”

While BEVs use charged battery packs, hydrogen fuel cell EVs generate electricity through a chemical reaction between hydrogen and oxygen. The only byproducts are water vapor and warm air, making them a zero-emission alternative to gas-powered cars.

Instead of a lithium-ion battery pack, hydrogen cars rely on electricity from the hydrogen-oxygen reaction to power their motors. However, hydrogen vehicles still face major hurdles before achieving mass adoption. Toyota is the only automaker to make a notable investment in them, though its efforts haven’t gained much traction in the market.

Most automakers prioritized BEVs, and many drivers haven’t heard of hydrogen-powered vehicles or the environmental benefits they offer. Furthermore, hydrogen cars have yet to prove their effectiveness compared to BEVs and gas-powered vehicles.

Still, many auto industry leaders believe hydrogen technology could play a key role in long-haul transport and certain commercial applications. Toyota emphasizes that hydrogen cars serve specific needs. According to the company’s Mobility Communication Consultant Josh Burns, a customer’s budget, lifestyle, and available infrastructure will determine whether hydrogen or battery electric makes more sense.

Though hydrogen cars emit no pollutants, their sustainability depends on how the hydrogen is produced. Clean hydrogen, derived from renewable sources, is essential if hydrogen vehicles are to be considered truly green.

One of the biggest upsides of hydrogen vehicles is convenience. Refueling takes as little as five minutes, much faster than charging most BEVs, and the process is just as easy as filling up a gas tank. Hydrogen cars also offer more consistent performance over time since they don’t rely on batteries that degrade with age.

A typical hydrogen vehicle can travel around 400 miles on a single tank, comparable to or better than many electric cars. However, hydrogen fuel is more expensive than gasoline or electricity, and the limited number of refueling stations restricts where these vehicles can realistically operate.

Because of this, hydrogen car owners must plan their routes carefully. Drivers outside areas with hydrogen infrastructure, mostly in California, Japan, and a few parts of Europe, simply don’t have the option of owning one.

While hydrogen fuel cell vehicles remain a niche market today, their fast refueling, long range, and zero emissions keep them in the conversation about the future of clean transportation, especially for uses where battery electric vehicles may fall short.

As HFCEV technology is further developed, it will have to prove itself against competition from fossil-fueled vehicles and EVs from various manufacturers like Massimo Group (NASDAQ: MAMO).

If you buy the right trim, you can get up to 478 miles of range. Not in a slickly aerodynamic Lucid Air sedan. In a full-size pickup truck.

Quietly Becoming The Class Leader

It seems that the Sierra EV hasn't had a lot of headlines despite having a reasonable entry price of $64,495 and a brutal amount of power available with the range – up to 760 horsepower (Denali Max Range) with 785 lb-ft of torque.

With a GM-estimated 478 miles of range, the Sierra EV AT4 with available Max Range can travel from Los Angeles to Phoenix, San Francisco to Santa Barbara or New York City to Virginia Beach on a full charge. This surpasses the 2025 Ford F-150 Lightning, Rivian R1T and Tesla Cybertruck to stand out in the all-electric truck market.

As you can see above, GMC isn't afraid of throwing some shade at Ford, Rivian, and Tesla over this. In reality, going so nuts for range doesn't make a huge amount of logical sense. Most people don't travel more than an average of 40 miles a day, although work trucks can easily average a hundred miles a day. While people will occasionally make 400-mile journeys, that's an awful lot of battery to carry around daily for those occasions. However, range anxiety isn't logical, but it is very real, and getting caught on a journey with no chargers around or only broken chargers isn't fun.

A lawsuit filed in a Washington state court claims oil companies are responsible for the death of a woman in Seattle during a record-breaking heat wave several years ago.

The case marks the first time oil companies have been sued over the death of a person in a ""climate disaster,"" according to the Center for Climate Integrity, an advocacy group.

Julie Leon, 65, was found unresponsive in her car on June 28, 2021 — the hottest day in Seattle's history. The temperature in the city that day peaked at 108 degrees Fahrenheit. By the time Leon died of hyperthermia, her internal temperature had risen to 110 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the lawsuit filed Thursday in King County Superior Court.

The suit names six oil companies, including ExxonMobil, BP and Chevron, that have allegedly known for decades that burning fossil fuels alters the Earth's atmosphere, resulting in more extreme weather and the ""foreseeable loss of human life."" But rather than warn the public, the suit says the oil companies deceived consumers about the risks.

""Defendants have known for all of Julie's life that their affirmative misrepresentations and omissions would claim lives,"" the lawsuit says. ""Julie is a victim of Defendants' conduct.""

In a rapid attribution study released days after the event, a team of scientists said the 2021 heatwave in the Pacific Northwest would have been ""virtually impossible without human-caused climate change.""

A lawyer for Chevron, Theodore Boutrous, criticized the lawsuit. ""Exploiting a personal tragedy to promote politicized climate tort litigation is contrary to law, science, and common sense,"" Boutrous said in a statement to NPR. ""The court should add this far-fetched claim to the growing list of meritless climate lawsuits that state and federal courts have already dismissed.""

Representatives of Shell, ConocoPhillips, BP and Phillips 66 declined to comment. A spokesperson for ExxonMobil said a comment from the company wasn't immediately available.

Julie Leon's daughter, Misti Leon, who filed the wrongful death lawsuit in Washington state, wants the oil companies to pay damages in amounts that would be determined at trial. Misti Leon is also trying to force the oil companies to conduct a public education campaign to correct ""decades of misinformation.""

Fossil fuel companies already face dozens of other climate lawsuits filed by states and localities for allegedly misleading the public for decades about the dangers of burning fossil fuels, the primary cause of climate change. Those lawsuits seek money to help communities cope with the risks and damages from global warming, including more extreme storms, floods and heat waves. The American Petroleum Institute, an industry group, has said repeatedly that the lawsuits are meritless and that climate change is an issue that should be dealt with by Congress, not the courts.

Those kinds of lawsuits have had mixed results. A Pennsylvania judge recently dismissed a climate lawsuit that Bucks County filed against several oil companies. Court of Common Pleas Judge Stephen Corr said the lawsuit was beyond the scope of state law. Since it was primarily about greenhouse gas emissions, he said it was a matter for the federal government to deal with under the Clean Air Act. Judge Corr noted that other courts have dismissed similar lawsuits by cities and states, including New Jersey and Baltimore.

Boutrous, Chevron's lawyer in the Pennsylvania case, told WHYY that climate change is a ""policy issue that needs statewide, nationwide and global cooperation to resolve. These state lawsuits just don't really do anything other than clog the courts.""

Other cases, though, are moving forward. In January, the Supreme Court rejected an effort by oil and gas companies to block a climate lawsuit filed by Honolulu, and in March the justices turned down a request by Republican attorneys general to try to stop climate lawsuits filed by states including California, Connecticut, Minnesota and Rhode Island. The American Petroleum Institute said in statements to NPR at the time that it was disappointed by the Supreme Court's decisions, saying the lawsuits are a ""distraction"" and ""waste of taxpayer resources.""

However, the issue has caught the attention of the Trump administration. On May 1, the Justice Department sued Michigan and Hawaii to try to stop those states from filing climate lawsuits against the fossil fuel industry.

Douglas Kysar, faculty director of the Law, Environment and Animals Program at Yale Law School, said Leon's lawsuit stands out from other climate cases that are working their way through the courts.

""The advantage of this lawsuit is that it puts an individual human face on the massive harmful consequences of collective climate inaction,"" Kysar said in an email to NPR. ""Not only that, the complaint tells a story of industry betrayal of public trust through the eyes of a particular person.""

The Permitting Technology Action Plan provides a government-wide strategy to optimize technology to effectively and efficiently evaluate environmental permits, allowing for seamless information exchange between agencies, simplified interactions for applicants, and greater transparency and predictability on environmental review and permitting schedules for sponsors and stakeholders.

The Permitting Technology Action Plan contains:

Minimum functional requirements for environmental review and permitting systems;

An initial National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and permitting data and technology standard;

A timeline and implementation roadmap for agencies; and

A governance structure for implementation.

This Permitting Technology Action Plan is a testament to the Trump Administration’s commitment to expediting and simplifying the environmental review and permitting process. It delivers on President Trump’s Memorandum, Updating Permitting Technology for the 21st Century, and follows the establishment of the Permitting Innovation Center. Working with the General Services Administration’s Technology Transformation Services, the CEQ-led Permitting Innovation Center will design and test prototype permitting technology systems in order to advise Federal agencies on the adoption of the best-in-class-tools.

“The Trump Administration is working tirelessly to implement innovation-driven environmental review and permitting reforms to eliminate needless delays that cripple the growth of the U.S. economy, replacing outdated technology with efficient, speedier solutions,” said Katherine Scarlett, Chief of Staff at the White House Council on Environmental Quality. “Through interagency coordination, this Administration has taken bold action to streamline the NEPA process and get America back to building infrastructure projects of all kinds.”

“Under President Trump’s leadership, we will ensure the Federal government is maximizing modern technologies to streamline permitting,” said Thomas Shedd, Technology Transformation Services Director at the General Services Administration. “Technology Transformation Services remains committed to supporting the execution of the Permitting Technology Action Plan by building the tools agencies can use to accelerate their environmental review and permitting processes – with results in weeks or months, not years.”

The solutions laid out in the Permitting Technology Action Plan will leverage technology to tackle longstanding problems identified in CEQ’s E-NEPA Report to Congress—including, reliance on outdated systems, fragmented data management, and disconnected digital tools—reinforcing this Administration’s unwavering dedication to deliver outstanding results at 21st century speeds.

In Case You Missed It: President Trump Unleashes Permitting Technology for the 21st Century

“We need to drill more, map more, mine more, and build more — all while innovating faster than our global competitors,” said Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum. “The Permitting Technology Action Plan will channel our greatest asset, American innovation and technology, to overhaul our current permitting process and power our nation faster, better, cleaner, and more reliably than ever before. Embracing cutting-edge development and modernizing this outdated system will pave the way to American success.”

“With President Trump’s leadership, this administration is taking action to fix a broken system that’s slowing down critical energy projects across the country. Outdated permitting systems are creating costly delays at the exact moment we need to be expanding capacity, strengthening our energy security, and building the infrastructure that powers American industry and lowers costs for families,” said Secretary of Energy Chris Wright. “As Secretary of Energy and Vice Chair of the National Energy Dominance Council, I welcome this decisive action to modernize permitting technology, cut red tape, and align the full force of the federal government behind getting these essential projects approved and built—because energy dominance isn’t possible without the infrastructure to support it.”

“When President Trump says American farmers and ranchers have been the lifeblood of our economy for centuries, he means it. For too long, our producers have experienced delays and uncertainty as they navigate a complex permitting process that gets in the way of American innovation and stifles energy and timber production. This historic Memorandum will increase efficiency and transparency so farmers, foresters, and producers can get back to the work they do every day to feed, fuel, and clothe our nation,” said Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins.

“It takes too long to build in America,” said Secretary of Transportation Sean P. Duffy. “Ridiculous red tape and outdated regulations add cost and delays to projects. It has to stop. Thanks to President Trump’s leadership, we are slashing the bureaucracy and getting back to actually building things in America again. We are doing that by harnessing innovative technology to expedite the permitting process.”",https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/WH47-Social-Share-Card.jpg,N,,2025-05-30 14:28:38.203682

Ford received a reduced incentive package from Michigan last year for the battery plant after it cut expected production there to match slowing demand for electric vehicles. Since the automaker announced the plant in 2023, it has drawn scrutiny from some lawmakers for its ties to the Chinese company.

Over the past few months, the Texas Senate passed three bills that could’ve devastated the state’s nation-leading renewable energy rollout — but clean energy appears to have dodged the bullet.

The first of those bills would establish new fees, setback requirements, and other permitting regulations on utility-scale wind and solar development, even though fossil-fuel plants don’t face the same restrictions. The second would require large renewables installations to buy gas generation as a backup.

And the third would ensure all renewable power development came with a side of fossil fuels, as it directed that 50% of all new power plant capacity added to the state’s grid come from dispatchable resources other than battery storage. That would have amounted to a gas mandate: Since solar panels and wind turbines can only produce power under certain conditions (sun shining, wind blowing, you know the drill), they can only be dispatchable power sources if batteries are involved. An earlier version of the bill explicitly said 50% of new capacity would have to come from gas.

These bills would have seriously slowed Texas’ deployment of solar, batteries, and wind power, which are shattering power-generation records in the state and helping its grid withstand extreme weather and meet surging electricity demand. The legislation would have caused reliability to fall and utility bills to soar, according to an April report from Aurora Energy Research.

But the Texas House’s session is set to end on June 2, and none of those three bills have been scheduled for consideration. This doesn’t necessarily mean they won’t resurface at some point, but they’re at least dead as standalone bills for this session, Doug Lewin writes in his Texas Energy and Power newsletter.

There are growing signs that these sorts of restrictions on renewables aren’t popular among many Texas Republicans and business interests. Recent polling from Conservative Texans for Energy Innovation shows widespread Republican support for renewables, while even the Texas Oil and Gas Association allied with renewable power generators to oppose the state House’s companion to the Senate’s bill requiring gas backup for clean energy.

Similar efforts in the state were defeated two years ago as well.

More big energy stories

DOE orders a coal plant to stay open

The Trump administration took its pro-coal agenda to a new level last Friday, ordering a retiring Michigan coal plant to stay open through at least the end of August. The J.H. Campbell plant was supposed to shut down tomorrow, and Michigan utility Consumers Energy had been working since at least 2021 to do so. But the administration contended that the Midwest faces an ​“energy emergency” and needs the plant to guarantee power reliability.

Clean energy advocates, consumer watchdogs, and even Michigan’s top energy regulator disagree. ​“We currently produce more energy in Michigan than needed,” Michigan Public Service Commission Chair Dan Scripps said in a statement. ​“The unnecessary recent order from the U.S. Department of Energy will increase the cost of power for homes and businesses across the Midwest.”

Trump’s nuclear orders probably won’t outweigh cuts

President Donald Trump signed a series of executive orders late last week to boost nuclear power — though they probably won’t counteract his many moves to weaken the industry. The four orders will:

Expedite nuclear reactor testing at federal labs, with a goal of approving three new designs by next year.

Slash regulations for building nuclear reactors on federal lands.

Speed the Nuclear Regulatory Commission’s reviews of reactor licenses.

Boost uranium mining and enrichment.

But in recent months, the Trump administration has also looked to reduce funding for the Energy Department’s Office of Nuclear Energy, and cut staff at the Loan Programs Office, even though it funds nuclear reactor projects. And though nuclear made out better than other low-carbon energy sources in the federal budget bill recently passed by the House, projects would only be eligible for tax credits if they start construction by 2028 — an ambitious timeline for a famously slow-to-build energy source. Those are big setbacks that won’t ​“magically be solved” by simply cutting red tape, Josh Freed, who heads the climate and energy program at that think tank Third Way, told Latitude Media.

The Detroit District is inviting the public and concerned parties to participate in a 30-day public comment period, which runs from May 30 to June 30, 2025. Comments can be submitted through several methods, including the , virtual public meetings, and written submissions.

Virtual public meetings are scheduled for Wednesday, June 18, 2025, from 1 to 4 p.m., and Wednesday, June 25, 2025, from 5 to 8 p.m. Written comments must be postmarked by June 30, 2025, and sent to Line 5 Tunnel EIS, 6501 Shady Grove Road, P.O. Box 10178, Gaithersburg, MD 20898.

The analysis moves the corps a step closer to approving the tunnel for Line 5 in the Straits of Mackinac. The tunnel was proposed in 2018 at a cost of $500 million but has been bogged down by legal challenges. The corps fast-tracked the project in April after President Donald Trump ordered federal agencies in January to identify energy projects for expedited emergency permitting.

A final environmental assessment is expected by autumn, with a permitting decision to follow later this year. The agency initially planned to issue a permitting decision in early 2026.

With that permit in hand, Enbridge would only need permission from the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy before it could begin constructing the tunnel. That's far from a given, though.

Environmentalists have been pressuring the state to deny the permit. Meanwhile, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel and Gov. Gretchen Whitmer are trying to win court rulings that would force Enbridge to remove the existing pipeline from the straits for good.

Construction could have major short-term, long-term impacts

The analysis notes that the tunnel would eliminate the risk of a boat anchor rupturing the pipeline and causing a spill in the straits, a key concern for environmentalists. But the construction would have sweeping effects on everything from recreation to wildlife.

Many of the impacts, such as noise, vistas marred by 400-foot (121-meter) cranes, construction lights degrading stargazing opportunities at Headlands International Dark Sky Park and vibrations that would disturb aquatic wildlife would end when the work is completed, the report found.

Other impacts would last longer, including the loss of wetlands and vegetation on both sides of the strait that connects Lake Huron and Lake Michigan, and the loss of nearly 300 trees that the northern long-eared bat and tricolored bat use to roost. Grading and excavation also could disturb or destroy archaeological sites.

The tunnel-boring machine could cause vibrations that could shift the area's geology. Soil in the construction area could become contaminated and nearly 200 truck trips daily during the six-year construction period would degrade area roads, the analysis found. Gas mixing with water seeping into the tunnel could result in an explosion, but the analysis notes that Enbridge plans to install fans to properly ventilate the tunnel during excavation.

Enbridge has pledged to comply with all safety standards, replant vegetation where possible and contain erosion, the analysis noted. The company also has said it would try to limit the loudest work to daytime hours as much as possible, and offset harm to wetlands and protected species by buying credits through mitigation banks. That money can then be used to fund restoration in other areas.

""Our goal is to have the smallest possible environmental footprint,"" Enbridge officials said in a statement.

The Sierra Club issued a statement Friday saying the tunnel remains ""an existential threat.""

""Chances of an oil spill in the Great Lakes — our most valuable freshwater resource — skyrockets if this tunnel is built in the Straits,"" the group said. ""We can't drink oil. We can't fish or swim in oil.""

Julie Goodwin, a senior attorney with Earthjustice, an environmental law group that opposes the project, said the corps failed to consider the impacts of a spill that could still happen on either side of the straits or stopping the flow of oil through the Great Lakes.

""My key takeaways are the Army corps has put blinders are in service to Enbridge and President Trump's fossil fuel agenda,"" she said.

Tunnel would protect portion of Line 5 running through straits

Enbridge has been using the Line 5 pipeline to transport crude oil and natural gas liquids between Superior, Wisconsin, and Sarnia, Ontario, since 1953. Roughly 4 miles (6 kilometers) of the pipeline runs along the bottom of the Straits of Mackinac.

Concerns about the aging pipeline rupturing and causing a potentially disastrous spill in the straits have been building over the last decade. Those fears intensified in 2018 when an anchor damaged the line.

Enbridge contends that the line remains structurally sound, but it struck a deal with then-Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder's administration in 2018 that calls for the company to replace the straits portion of the line with a new section that would be encased in a protective underground tunnel.

Enbridge and environmentalists spar in court battles

Environmentalists, Native American tribes and Democrats have been fighting in court for years to stop the tunnel and force Enbridge to remove the existing pipeline from the straits. They've had little success so far.

A Michigan appellate court in February validated the state Public Service Commission's permits for the tunnel. Nessel sued in 2019 seeking to void the easement that allows Line 5 to run through the straits. That case is still pending. Whitmer revoked the easement in 2020, but Enbridge challenged that decision and a federal appellate court in April ruled that the case can proceed.

Another legal fight over Line 5 in Wisconsin

About 12 miles (19 kilometers) of Line 5 runs across the Bad River Band of Lake Superior Chippewa's reservation in northern Wisconsin. That tribe sued in 2019 to force Enbridge to remove the line from the reservation, arguing it's prone to spilling and that easements allowing it to operate on the reservation expired in 2013.

The increased threat of litigation has forced federal agencies to better cover their bases, leading to longer and more expensive environmental reviews.","The Supreme Court ruled in favor of a Utah railroad project on Thursday, setting a precedent that could make it easier to build things in the United States.

The case at hand—Seven County Infrastructure Coalition v. Eagle County—involved an 88-mile-long railroad track in an oil-rich and rural area of Utah. The project would have connected this area to the national rail network, making it easier and more efficient to transport crude oil extracted in the region to refineries in Gulf Coast states.

In 2020, a group of seven Utah counties known as the Seven Counties Infrastructure Coalition submitted its application to the federal Surface Transportation Board (STB) for the project. During its review process, the board conducted six public meetings and collected over 1,900 comments to produce an environmental impact statement (EIS)—which is required by the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)—that spanned over 3,600 pages. The board approved the project's construction in 2021.

Before construction could begin, however, Eagle County, Colorado, and several environmental groups filed suit, challenging the STB's approval. Specifically, this coalition argued that the STB did not consider the downstream environmental effects of the project—such as increased oil drilling in Utah and refining in the Gulf Coast. The Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit agreed with the plaintiffs and vacated the railroad's construction approval.

In an 8–0 decision on Thursday (Justice Neil Gorsuch recused himself from the case), the Supreme Court overturned the lower court's ruling.

In its majority opinion, authored by Justice Brett Kavanaugh, the Court clarified that under NEPA the STB ""did not need to evaluate potential environmental impacts of the separate upstream and downstream projects."" The Court concluded that the ""proper judicial approach for NEPA cases is straightforward: Courts should review an agency's EIS to check that it addresses the environmental effects of the project at hand. The EIS need not address the effects of separate projects.""

This statement ""is particularly significant for infrastructure projects, such as pipelines or transmission lines, and should help reduce NEPA's burdens (at least at the margins),"" wrote Jonathan Adler, a law professor at the Case Western Reserve University School of Law, in The Volokh Conspiracy. ""The opinion will also likely hamper any future efforts, perhaps by Democratic administrations, to expand or restore more fulsome (and burdensome) NEPA requirements.""

One recent example is former President Joe Biden, who finalized rules requiring federal agencies to consider a project's impacts on climate change—a global issue that is incredibly complex and hard to forecast—in their NEPA analyses. The Trump administration recently rescinded this requirement.

Kavanaugh's opinion also clarified that courts should ""afford substantial deference"" to federal agencies in their EIS reviews and ""should not micromanage"" agency choices ""so long as they fall within a broad zone of reasonableness.""

This point could reduce one of the largest delays caused by NEPA: litigation. Since its passage in 1969, NEPA has been weaponized by environmental groups to stunt disfavored projects—which has disproportionately impacted clean energy projects. On average, these challenges delay a permitted project's start time by 4.2 years, according to The Breakthrough Institute.

The increased threat of litigation has forced federal agencies to better cover their bases, leading to longer and more expensive environmental reviews. With courts deferring more to agency decisions, litigation could be settled more quickly.

""NEPA has transformed from a modest procedural requirement into a blunt and haphazard tool employed by project opponents (who may not always be entirely motivated by concern for the environment) to try to stop or at least slow down new infrastructure and construction projects,"" wrote Kavanaugh. ""All of that has led to more agency analysis of separate projects, more consideration of attenuated effects, more exploration of alternatives to proposed agency action, more speculation and consultation and estimation and litigation.""",https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2024/02/dreamstime_l_12184614-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-05-30 15:22:52.726322

""Once that tax credit goes away, I'm expecting [electric vehicles] to be about 2% of sales,"" Fix said, noting that EVs currently account for around 8% of total car sales in the U.S. ""There will still be electric vehicle sales, Tesla will still survive and [Elon Musk] will do well.

Tesla, the leading EV manufacturer in the U.S., has focused more on selling carbon credits to other automakers than it has on consumer tax incentives. The company, which has moved the bulk of its production to Texas, has also become ""more efficient and effective"" in its manufacturing, according to Fix.

""What Tesla has done, and they don't really care about the $7,500 tax credit, is they were selling carbon credits to all the other car manufacturers,"" Fix said. ""That's where they've made their profits.""
