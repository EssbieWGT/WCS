Stellantis is making a decisive move to strengthen its presence in the US auto market, committing $13 billion to expand its domestic production footprint. The investment is the largest in the company’s 100-year US history and reflects a strategic bet on American manufacturing as the industry enters a pivotal phase of transformation.

The four-year plan includes five new vehicle launches, 19 refreshed models and the creation of more than 5,000 jobs across facilities in Illinois, Ohio, Michigan and Indiana. Stellantis expects to boost annual vehicle production in the US by 50 percent, reinforcing its long-term strategy to compete in high-demand segments and deliver new technologies to market.

Jeep factory reopens in Illinois

A centerpiece of the plan is the reopening of the Belvidere, Illinois, plant. Once idled in 2023, the facility will resume production with two key Jeep models, the Cherokee and Compass, beginning in 2027. The Jeep factory reopening will create about 3,300 jobs and signals a renewed commitment to domestic assembly.

In addition, the Toledo, Ohio, plant will receive nearly $400 million to support the production of a new midsize truck. Originally designated for Belvidere, the program has been reassigned to Toledo, where the Jeep Wrangler and Gladiator are currently built. Stellantis says the investment will generate more than 900 jobs at the complex.

EV and engine production expands

The company is also preparing for a more electrified product line. In Warren, Michigan, Stellantis plans to retool its plant to build a large SUV powered by both a range-extended electric system and a traditional internal combustion engine. Production is expected to begin in 2028 and add more than 900 jobs. In Detroit, the company will invest $130 million to launch the next-generation Dodge Durango by 2029.

In Indiana, more than $100 million will go toward expanding Stellantis’ powertrain output. The Kokomo facilities will become the production hub for the new GMET4 EVO four-cylinder engine starting in 2026. The expansion is expected to create over 100 jobs and anchor Indiana’s role in advanced engine manufacturing.

A shift in US car manufacturing

This move by Stellantis reflects a growing trend in US car manufacturing growth. As automakers respond to shifting consumer preferences and federal incentives, domestic investment is becoming critical to long-term competitiveness. The US electric vehicle market is expanding, and companies like Stellantis are adopting flexible production strategies that support both electric and gasoline-powered models.

The $13 billion Stellantis US investment is not only a show of confidence in American manufacturing, it is also a response to rising pressure to localize production. As federal policies reward homegrown development, Stellantis appears well positioned to lead the next phase of automotive growth.

Orsted operates a large portfolio of offshore wind farms and is building six more.
Since then, Orsted has led the way in building wind farms in waters off Europe and elsewhere, including Taiwan.
Not all of the Danish wind industry is struggling.
The Trump administration has taken several steps to curb offshore wind, including halting construction on two wind farms off the East Coast of the United States.","For the Danish wind farm developer Orsted, the bad news has not stopped. Once on its way to becoming a giant of renewable energy, the company is now shrinking in everything from stock market value to ambition.

The reversal of fortune comes amid a broad downturn in the offshore wind industry set off by rising construction costs and interest rates after the pandemic and exacerbated by President Trump’s dislike of wind farms.

Orsted, which helped create and dominated the offshore wind industry, has felt a huge impact from these setbacks. The company said last week that it would lay off 2,000 people, or 25 percent of its staff, over the next two years.

Rasmus Errboe, the company’s president and chief executive, offered a blunt explanation for the job cuts: Orsted was narrowing its focus and dialing back its aspirations.

Instead of lining up new, multibillion-dollar wind farms to build in shallow waters around the globe, Orsted will mainly focus on finishing those it has under construction and managing them or selling them off.

The company will complete “our large construction portfolio in the coming years, which is why we’ll need fewer employees,” Mr. Errboe said in a statement.

Orsted operates a large portfolio of offshore wind farms and is building six more. These arrays of enormous turbines produce the bulk of the company’s revenue, close to $7 billion this year, according to analysts’ estimates.

The reshaping of Orsted is rippling across its home country, Denmark, which for half a century has been a nurturing ground of the contemporary wind industry.

A predecessor of Orsted built the world’s first offshore wind farm, Vindeby, in 1991 in Denmark. Since then, Orsted has led the way in building wind farms in waters off Europe and elsewhere, including Taiwan. Europe now has more than 3,600 offshore wind turbines, many of them developed by Orsted.

Not all of the Danish wind industry is struggling. Vestas Wind Systems, the leading maker of wind turbines, looks better positioned for the current environment because it is largely focused on land-based equipment rather than offshore machines and has factories in Colorado that should help buffer any impact from Mr. Trump’s tariffs.

Orsted said 235 of the 500 layoffs planned for this quarter would be in Denmark, where some 33,000 people work in the wind industry, according to Green Power Denmark, an industry group.

The wind industry employs roughly 370,000 people in Europe and accounts for around 20 percent of the region’s electricity generation, according to WindEurope, a trade body.

As much as any country, Denmark has embraced a vision of a future in which much of the global economy runs to a great extent on electricity generated from green sources.

Recent developments, though, including rising costs and the Trump administration’s efforts to stymie renewable energy, have prompted a reassessment of some of the goals that the European Union and national authorities have set for the industry.

Wood Mackenzie, an energy consulting firm, forecast that less than 50 percent of the cumulative targets set by national governments, excluding China, for offshore wind for the end of the decade will be achieved.

“I think, in terms of electrification, there are certainly warning signs,” said Anders Kronborg, senior economist at Copenhagen Economics, a research firm.

The Trump administration has taken several steps to curb offshore wind, including halting construction on two wind farms off the East Coast of the United States. It later allowed one, Empire Wind off New York, to move forward. A federal judge ruled that the other, Revolution Wind, a nearly completed Orsted project off Rhode Island, could continue.

Still, the intervention in projects where billions of dollars have already been spent has created uncertainty about investing in the United States.

“In the coming years, nobody will start any new projects in offshore wind in the U.S.,” said Anders Schelde, the chief financial officer of AkademikerPension, a Danish pension fund that invests in green energy. “I’m sure that it will probably also have some impact on other renewables,” he added.

Welcon, which fashions giant wind turbine sections called towers in the town of Give, in western Denmark, is supplying Orsted’s Revolution Wind and Sunrise Wind projects but is not expecting any new business from across the Atlantic.

“I don’t believe in the U.S. before we have a new president,” said Carsten Pedersen, the company’s chairman.

Mr. Pedersen said that Welcon’s vast factory in the flatlands of the Jutland peninsula had orders through 2027 but that he worried about the stamina of weaker companies and the lost momentum toward cleaner energy.

“It’s so sad, I think, what’s happening now,” he said. “We had a chance to make the green transition.”

The Danish government, which owns a majority of Orsted’s shares, has had to come to the aid of the company and the wind industry it supports by putting around $4.7 billion into a recent offering to shareholders.

“In my view, this is a business that is going to be around,” said Charles Lemonides, founder of ValueWorks, a New York-based fund management company that increased its stake in Orsted to about $15 million. “The world’s not using less electricity,” he added.

Analysts, though, say that in the coming years, Orsted is likely to be diminished as an instrument for expanding wind power. The company has been forced to concentrate on survival.

“After these assets are built, they don’t really have any other live projects,” said Deepa Venkateswaran, a utility analyst at Bernstein, a Wall Street research firm.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/16/multimedia/16biz-renewable-europe-01-zgbt/16biz-renewable-europe-01-zgbt-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-10-16 04:58:28.599666

Bowen was also slated to meet Power Minister Manohar Lal for the 5th India-Australia Energy Dialogue.

In November last year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Australian counterpart, Anthony Albanese, held the second India-Australia Annual Summit on the sidelines of the Group of 20 (G20) Summit in Rio de Janeiro. They shared an ambition to move faster, work together and deploy complementary capabilities to drive climate action.

PM Modi lauded the launch of the India-Australia Renewable Energy Partnership (REP), which would provide the framework for practical cooperation in priority areas such as solar PV, green hydrogen, energy storage, two-way investment in renewable energy projects and allied areas; and upgraded skills training for the renewable workforce of the future.

Sign up for their newsletter here.

During a recent visit to a Long Island power station, U.S. Department of Energy Secretary Chris Wright criticized Biden-era policies that supported the development of renewable energy sources.

“There was a lot of that money allocated under the Biden administration that was to encourage business and utilities to … spend money to make electricity more expensive and less reliable,” Wright said during a press conference.

The next day, the Trump administration announced the termination of 321 awards, claiming $7.5 billion in cuts for clean-energy projects. Inside Climate News recently reported that many of these awards were already past their end date.

Empire Clean Cities, which promotes the advancement of alternative fuels and alternative-fuel vehicles to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, was among the organizations that had its funds cut.

The Manhattan-based nonprofit will lose more than 90% of the funds for its $1.7 million award. So far, Empire Clean Cities had received only $162,631 of its award for a project designed to reduce emissions in Hunts Point in the Bronx, according to federal spending data. Largely due to truck traffic, this neighborhood has an annual child asthma hospitalization rate double the citywide average.

“It’s where folks live and work, and so they see every day the impact of truck traffic emissions on their air quality, on their health,” said Joy Gardner, the executive director of Empire Clean Cities. ​“This was a real opportunity to make a drastic change in just the general quality of life.”

Hunts Point attracts a high volume of freight traffic partly due to its proximity to food centers, including the Hunts Point Food Distribution Center. The city estimates that the center distributes around 4.5 billion pounds of food every year.

Empire Clean Cities is on the cusp of publishing an electrification plan for Hunts Point, with engagement from local businesses, communities, and city agencies. The plan would offer a pathway to electrification for vehicles operating in the neighborhood—and subsequently help alleviate the health issues many residents face.

Though Gardner said the plan is likely to still be published, other aspects of the plan could be delayed or may not happen at all. The nonprofit planned to install six fast-charging electric ports in the neighborhoods, for personal and freight vehicles, according to Gardner.

Empire Clean Cities also planned to provide technical assistance to businesses looking to electrify their truck fleets and information sessions for community members who might want to buy an electric vehicle. According to federal spending data, the nonprofit would ​“undertake an extensive suite of community outreach activities designed to break down the knowledge barriers preventing [electric vehicle] adoption in the neighborhood.”

“It’s really disappointing not to be able to take this over the finish line, especially with just a year left on the grant,” said Gardner. ​“We would have been able to do a tremendous amount with that.”

In a statement about the grant cancellations, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul (D) said, ​“These cuts directly impact local businesses and major companies, putting workers out of jobs, shuttering factories, and slowing our state’s economic progress.”

In response to questions from Inside Climate News, Ken Lovett, Hochul’s senior communications advisor on energy and environment, wrote that the announcement ​“came as no surprise given the Trump administration’s full-on assault on clean energy.”

The Trump administration announced the termination of 321 grants on Oct. 2. An Inside Climate News analysis of federal government spending data for the awards found that only 188 were still active, according to their stated end dates, at the end of September.

ICN subtracted money already sent to recipients from the sums obligated to be spent, calculating a total of $4.87 billion in cuts, roughly two-thirds of the dollar amount announced by the Department of Energy.

For recipients based in New York state, 20 awards were still active when the Trump administration announced the cuts. After accounting for the money already distributed, the state lost out on about $146 million.

But for Hochul, the grant cuts seem to be just the latest setback to her plans to deliver on the state’s lofty climate goals and address energy concerns. She has recently admitted that New York is unlikely to meet its climate targets, drawing the ire of many residents.

Hochul says she remains committed to reducing emissions in the state and has invested considerable funds toward that goal. She recently allocated $1 billion to clean-energy projects and emissions-reduction efforts and has directed the state-owned utility, the New York Power Authority, to build at least one new nuclear plant by 2040.

Hochul’s predicament

At a Brooklyn church in early September, the advocacy group Public Power NY hosted a People’s Hearing for Public Renewables, where officials, environmentalists, and a few dozen New York residents discussed the state’s renewable-energy plans and expressed disappointment with Hochul’s progress.

“We have a movement behind us that is fighting for something better,” said state Sen. Jabari Brisport, a Democrat who represents a district in Brooklyn. ​“We have a governor who wants to drag her feet.”

New York’s Climate Act requires the state to achieve a 40% reduction from 1990 levels in economy-wide greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and an 85% reduction by 2050. The act also requires that 70% of the state’s electricity come from renewable sources by 2030.

Residents were advocating for the New York Power Authority to build 15 gigawatts of renewable energy by 2030, which they view as necessary to meet the state’s goal of net-zero emissions from the electricity grid by 2040. Currently, the utility plans to build 7 gigawatts of renewable energy, despite state law requiring it to fill all gaps in electricity generation left by the private sector.

“Hurricane Ida completely destroyed my district,” said former Democratic U.S. Rep. Jamaal Bowman, whose district included White Plains and Yonkers. ​“We need a governor with human-centered leadership … and if not, we need a new governor.”

Much of the focus on achieving these climate goals has been on electrifying building heating and cooling with heat pumps and moving away from gas systems. In 2023, the state passed the All-Electric Building Act, which mandated that most buildings use electric appliances, and the all-electric standard was written into the state building code in July.

The legislation effectively requires most new buildings to be completely electric — so no gas heating or cooking. A similar law was passed in New York City in 2021.

At a recent press conference, Wright, the federal energy secretary, alluded to the ​“many productive dialogues” he has had with the governor, and said that two proposed gas pipelines, which would pass through the state and which state officials have rejected in the past, were ​“already planned” and would ​“lower the cost of heating.”

There has been speculation, fueled by a May post on X by Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum, that Hochul ​“would move forward on critical pipeline capacity.” The implication was that this was a trade-off for allowing the Empire Wind offshore wind project south of Long Island in the Atlantic Ocean to proceed after the administration halted construction.

Within a month, two previously rejected gas pipelines — the Constitution pipeline and the Northeast Supply Enhancement pipeline, or NESE — entered the regulatory process once again. Hochul has denied that she made a deal with the White House, but the Trump administration has said that she ​“caved” and agreed to allow the pipeline construction, according to Politico’s E&E News.

The Constitution pipeline, which the state rejected in 2016, would run from Pennsylvania’s Marcellus shale fracking sites to upstate New York. The NESE pipeline would extend an existing pipeline, building off the coast of New Jersey and Staten Island to eventually connect with existing pipes in Queens, and add gas infrastructure to Pennsylvania. The state has rejected it three times.

In July, National Grid, the gas utility that serves Staten Island, Long Island, and parts of Brooklyn and Queens, added the NESE pipeline to its long-term gas plan as an addendum.

The utility has to file a long-term gas plan as a result of a dispute with former Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D). The heart of the 2019 dispute was, ironically, an earlier proposal for the NESE pipeline, which the Department of Environmental Conservation had rejected due to its potential impacts on water quality.

The rejection led to a standoff between the utility and state officials, with National Grid refusing to connect customers to gas lines. The dispute only ended because Cuomo threatened to suspend the utility’s license to operate in the state. In the end, National Grid agreed to periodically file a long-term gas plan for review by the state’s Public Service Commission, which regulates utility rates.

The NESE pipeline resurfaces

While reviewing the utility’s plan for the future last month, members of the Public Service Commission found that the NESE project would help the state meet the energy needs of its residents and businesses, particularly in the wake of Winter Storm Elliott in 2022. A report by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission found that some areas of New York were at extreme risk of experiencing gas shutoffs at one point during the storm.

But many New Yorkers were dismayed by the commission’s choice, which has no regulatory authority over the pipeline, but which many believe could signal to the Department of Environmental Conservation that the pipeline is necessary and that it should approve its water permit.

“We are in a week-by-week, hour-by-hour, fight to hold [Hochul] off and keep her from approving this thing,” Pete Sikora, the climate and inequality campaigns director with New York Communities for Change, said about the fight to stop the NESE pipeline.

Several public officials, including Staten Island Borough President Vito Fossella (R) and U.S. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D), spoke out against the pipeline, as did the city of New York. Water-quality concerns and fears of substantial rate increases abound.

“The governor is willing to put the law off to the side in order to appease fossil-fuel interests, big private business interests … and for New York families to foot the bill for that,” said Kim Fraczek, the executive director of Sane Energy, a nonprofit organization that is advocating for the replacement of gas infrastructure with renewable energy. ​“Our costs will only increase, and that’s for ratepayers and for businesses.”

A report by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, an energy-research think tank, estimated that the pipeline would cost $1.25 billion — almost $200 million more than what National Grid had said — due to construction inflation. Even if National Grid’s figures are correct, ratepayers would suffer a substantial monthly increase.

Hochul is also experiencing pressure from the other side of the aisle. Energy Secretary Wright recently criticized the state’s Climate Act, which requires the state to have a net-zero-emissions electricity grid by 2040, calling it ​“totally nuts.”

“The longer and more aggressively [net-zero] is pursued, the more you elevate your energy prices and impoverish your citizens,” Wright told journalists at the press conference in Long Island earlier this month. ​“Let’s build more energy infrastructure to drive down the cost of energy here in New York state, across New England, and across our country.”

Whether the Climate Act drives the state’s high energy prices remains a subject of debate. A recent Public Service Commission report found that cost recovery for Climate Act measures accounted for anywhere from 5% to 9.5% of a residential customer’s monthly electric bill — but consistently 2% or less of their gas bill — in 2024.

Another factor contributing to higher rates has been large-scale improvements in gas infrastructure. Last year, residents in downstate New York experienced rate hikes when National Grid began a $5 billion system upgrade, which included replacing ​“leak-prone” pipes across the region.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/GettyImages-2203085341.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=a990d02fba6305386b51364ddd7350d3,N,,2025-10-16 04:58:40.271173

The U.S electric vehicle market size was valued at USD 48.03 billion in 2024 and is anticipated to reach USD 60.26 billion in 2025 to USD 369.88 billion by 2033, growing at a CAGR of 25.46% during the forecast period from 2025 to 2033.

The electric vehicle is a structural reconfiguration of mobility, infrastructure, and industrial identity. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, EVs accounted for 11.2% of all new light-duty vehicle sales in 2023, up from just 4.6% in 2020, yet only 38% of American households live within five miles of a DC fast charger, as mapped by the Department of Transportation’s National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Program.

MARKET DRIVERS

Corporate Fleet Electrification as a Supply Chain Imperative

The acceleration of EV adoption is orchestrated by corporate logistics and procurement mandates that treat electrification as an operational necessity, which is augmented in propelling the growth of the U.S. electric vehicle market. In 2023 alone, these fleets ordered more than 150,000 electric vans and trucks, surpassing retail EV sales in several months, as documented by the Electrification Coalition’s Fleet Adoption Tracker. These fleets operate on fixed routes, predictable schedules, and centralized charging hubs, making them ideal candidates for electrification long before individual buyers overcome range anxiety.

State-Level Zero-Emission Vehicle Mandates Reshaping Dealer Networks

California, New York, and Washington now enforce Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) mandates requiring automakers to sell increasing percentages of EVs or face financial penalties, which is leveraging the growth of TheS. Electric vehicle market. Automakers are responding not by expanding retail offerings, while Ford redirecting F-150 Lightning production to prioritize regions where compliance incentives outweigh federal tax credit delays. These mandates bypass consumer hesitation entirely, forcing manufacturers to build EVs even when demand lags.

MARKET RESTRAINTS

Charging Infrastructure Disparities and Grid Strain in Rural and Low-Income Communities

The EV charging in affluent urban corridors, which is leaving rural and low-income communities behind, is restricting the growth of the U.S. electric vehicle market. Simultaneously, grid operators in areas like Arizona and Texas report transformer overloads caused by clusters of home EV charging during evening peaks, prompting utilities to impose “EV connection moratoriums” in neighborhoods without substation upgrades. The EV transition risks deepening mobility inequality, which is turning clean transportation into a privilege of zip code rather than policy.

Battery Raw Material Dependency and Supply Chain Fragility

The dependence on foreign-sourced minerals is undermining its claim to energy sovereignty, which is quietly inhibiting the growth of the U.S. electric vehicle market. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, 78% of lithium and 62% of cobalt used in U.S.-assembled EV batteries are imported from China, Australia, and the Democratic Republic of Congo, while less than 1% of lithium refining occurs domestically. Even recycling infrastructure lags, as only 5% of end-of-life EV batteries are currently processed domestically, per the ReCell Center’s 2023 Recovery Report.

MARKET OPPORTUNITIES

Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) Integration as a Distributed Energy Resource

The electric vehicles are evolving from passive consumers into active grid assets through bidirectional charging systems that allow EVs to discharge stored energy back into homes or the grid during peak demand. The growing demand is ascribed to boosting the growth of the U.S. electric vehicle market to some extent. According to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, pilot programs in California and Vermont demonstrated that a single V2G-enabled EV can provide up to 8 kWh of backup power, enough to sustain a household for six hours during an outage. Meanwhile, Ford’s F-150 Lightning, now sold with Home Power Backup capability, has been integrated into utility demand-response programs in Texas, where owners earn $150/month for allowing their vehicles to feed power back during emergencies.

Industrial-Grade Charging Hubs as Economic Anchors in Declining Regions

The deployment of high-capacity EV charging stations along major freight corridors is becoming a catalyst for regional revitalization in economically distressed communities. Similarly, in Detroit, the city partnered with Electrify America to install 120 charging ports across abandoned auto plants, transforming shuttered industrial sites into mobility innovation zones with training centers for EV technicians. These hubs serve not just passenger vehicles, but delivery fleets, transit buses, and heavy-duty trucks sectors that are rapidly electrifying under federal mandates.

MARKET CHALLENGES

Cybersecurity Vulnerabilities in the Connected EV Ecosystem

GA's growing number of cyber threats, with the penetration of internet connectivity with EEVs, is merely a challenging factor for the growth of the U.S. electric vehicle market. According to the SAE International Cybersecurity Benchmark Report, 89% of EV models tested in 2023 had exploitable vulnerabilities in telematics systems, including unencrypted communication channels, default passwords in firmware, and remote access flaws that could allow hackers to disable brakes, lock doors, or drain batteries remotely. The threat is not theoretical, but a coordinated cyberattack targeting EV charging networks could trigger cascading grid failures, especially during peak demand events. The future of mobility is being wired without armor.

Consumer Perception Gap Between Cost of Ownership and Upfront Price

The persistent consumer resistance from the psychological dissonance between upfront price and long-term savings is expected to slow the growth of the U.S. electric vehicle market. Meanwhile, insurance premiums for EVs remain 18–22% higher than ICE vehicles due to repair complexity and parts scarcity, further eroding perceived value. The car may be cheaper to run, but the story hasn’t been told right.

REPORT COVERAGE

SEGMENT ANALYSIS

By Vehicle Insights

The passenger electric cars segment was the largest and held a dominant share of the U.S. EV market in 2024, with the environmental idealism, but in cultural familiarity and infrastructure accessibility, passenger EVs leverage existing residential charging networks and benefit from decades of automotive branding that equates ownership with personal identity. Tesla’s Model Y became the best-selling vehicle in America across all fuel types in Q4 2023, per Cox Automotive data, while Ford Mustang Mach-E and Chevrolet Bolt EV gained traction among middle-income households seeking tech-forward alternatives to gasoline sedans.

The commercial electric vehicles segment is likely to grow with a significant CAGR of 58.7% from 2025 to 2033. The U.S. Postal Service ordered 10,000 Oshkosh-built electric delivery vans in 2023 alone, which is a program that will replace 16% of its entire fleet by 2026, according to USPS Office of Inspector General reports. Walmart, FedEx, and UPS have collectively committed to over 200,000 EVs by 2030, creating predictable, large-scale demand that automakers prioritize over consumer models. These fleets operate on fixed routes, centralized depots, and predictable usage cycles by making them ideal candidates for electrification long before individual consumers overcome range anxiety. California was the top performer of the U.S. EV market by capturing 39.3% of share in 2024, with the nation’s most populous state and regulatory laboratory, making it the de facto proving ground for electrification policy.

Throwing billions of taxpayer dollars at our failing coal stations, and repealing our Renewable Energy Targets, does nothing but scare away renewable energy investors at a time when we need new energy supply to drive down emissions and power bills.

The Crisafulli Government is playing Queenslanders for fools by pretending they’re going to keep their emission reduction promises while pledging to keep coal chugging along for decades.

Keeping coal power stations on taxpayer-funded life support and massively expanding polluting gas is incompatible with reducing emissions. The Crisafulli Government is not following through on their word to protect our communities and Great Barrier Reef from the worst impacts of climate change.

Climate change is already having significant impacts on hundreds of thousands of Queenslanders every year through more unnatural weather events. Without urgent action, it is likely that 6.5% of Queensland homes could be uninsurable by 2030.

Queensland’s electricity sector is responsible for 34%, or the lion’s share, of the state’s climate pollution. It’s vital to repower our energy system with renewable energy backed by storage in order to underpin the decarbonisation in other sectors, like transport.

In the Crisafulli Government’s new Energy Roadmap they effectively model a stifling of new renewable energy supply so that we only achieve 55 per cent renewable energy by 2035.

In the past ten years renewable energy grew from less than 3% of Queensland’s electricity needs to 30%. And now solar and battery storage are cheaper than ever.

India’s Robust Push Toward Electric Mobility India EV market is growing at unprecedented speed.","China has officially filed a complaint against India at the World Trade Organisation (WTO), alleging that New Delhi’s electric vehicle (EV) and battery manufacturing subsidies give domestic companies an unfair advantage over global competitors. The dispute marks a new flashpoint in the fast-growing global EV industry. The use of WTO mechanisms by China, ironically seen as one of the biggest backers of subsidies for domestic industry will not be missed by anyone.

China’s Complaint and Its Concerns

According to reports, China’s Ministry of Commerce has warned that it will take “firm measures” to protect the rights of Chinese EV manufacturers. Beijing claims that India’s extensive incentive programmes - ranging from EV production subsidies to concessional tax benefits - distort the playing field for Chinese automakers considering entry into the Indian market.

The complaint comes at a time when India is planning to create a National Critical Mineral Stockpile (NCMS). The NCMS aims to secure long-term access to essential rare earth elements used in EV batteries, solar panels, and wind turbines. This initiative follows China’s recent restrictions on exporting key minerals, a move that has intensified global efforts to diversify supply chains away from Beijing.

Under WTO rules, India now has 30 days to enter consultations with China to resolve the issue. If both nations fail to reach an agreement, China can request the formation of a dispute settlement panel to adjudicate the case.

EV Overcapacity and China’s Expanding Push Abroad

China’s EV industry has developed rapidly over the past decade with strong state support, including subsidies, tax rebates, and consumer incentives. In a now familiar templete, domestic capacities have been bult to serve the global market, leading to serious overcapacity issues as countries have sought to block cheaper Chinese entrants. On top of that , as China's domestic market slows and production capacity outpaces demand, many Chinese automakers, such as BYD, face a massive challange without access to newer, significant markets. Interestingly, the recent report by AlixPartners noted that only 15 out of the 129 electric vehicle (EV) and plug-in hybrid brands currently operating in China are expected to remain financially viable by 2030.

India, with its vast consumer base and growing clean mobility ecosystem, presents an attractive opportunity. However, India’s increasing protection for domestic manufacturing and preference for local value addition have raised concerns for foreign firms attempting to compete on equal terms.

India’s Robust Push Toward Electric Mobility

India EV market is growing at unprecedented speed. In FY 2024–25, electric two‑wheeler sales reached 11.49 lakh units, up 21 percent from the previous year. This expansion is being built on the back of several government schemes designed to make India a hub for clean transportation and advanced battery manufacturing.

Government Incentives Driving Growth

FAME Phase-I & National Electric Mobility Mission Plan (NEMMP) 2020:

FAME India Scheme (Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric Vehicles) was implemented from 2015 to 2019 to encourage the adoption of electric and hybrid vehicles. Under the first phase of FAME (Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric Vehicles), more than 2.55 lakh EVs were supported, along with the development of essential charging infrastructure.

National Electric Mobility Mission Plan (NEMMP) 2020 was launched to accelerate EV production and adoption.

FAME India Phase‑II:

Introduced in April 2019 with a budget of ₹11,500 crore, this scheme boosted EV adoption on a national scale. As of June 2025, 16.29 lakh vehicles have received support under FAME II. The programme also focused on strengthening India’s electric bus network and expanding fast‑charging facilities.

PLI Schemes for EVs and Batteries:

The Production Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme for the automobile sector, worth ₹25,938 crore, incentivizes domestic manufacturing of Advanced Automotive Technologies (AAT). By March 2025, investments under this scheme exceeded ₹29,500 crore. Participation requires at least 50% domestic value addition to qualify for the incentives.

Another major initiative—the PLI Scheme for Advanced Chemistry Cell (ACC) Battery Storage—targets local manufacturing capacity of 50 GWh by leveraging ₹18,100 crore in investment support. As of February 2025, 40 GWh of projects have been awarded.

PM Electric Drive Revolution in Innovative Vehicle Enhancement (PM E-DRIVE):

Approved in September 2024 and implemented till March 2028 with ₹10,900 crore, this comprehensive scheme provides direct subsidies to consumers. As of July 2025:

24.79 lakh e‑two‑wheelers received ₹1,772 crore in incentives.

3.15 lakh e‑three‑wheelers received ₹907 crore.

5,643 e‑trucks and several e‑ambulances received a combined ₹1,000 crore support.

14,028 electric buses were supported with ₹4,391 crore in funding.

Scheme for Promotion of Manufacturing of Electric Passenger Cars (SPMEPCI):

Launched in March 2024, this scheme blends consumer incentives with localization targets, complementing India’s central initiatives such as ‘Make in India’ and ‘Aatmanirbhar Bharat’.

PM‑eBus Sewa Scheme:

Introduced in August 2023 with a budget of ₹20,000 crore, this plan aims to deploy 10,000 electric buses under a Public‑Private Partnership (PPP) model, helping modernize urban transport.",https://img-cdn.publive.online/fit-in/1200x675/saur-energy/media/media_files/2025/10/16/china-challenges-indias-ev-subsidies-at-world-trade-organisation-2025-10-16-11-33-03.jpg,N,,2025-10-16 03:58:10.827208

The document warns that the PJM region — which serves roughly 65 million customers and is the country’s largest energy region — must deploy at least 16 GW of energy storage by 2032 and 23 GW by 2040 in order to maintain grid reliability. Without such build-out, the region risks forced load shedding during extreme weather, sharp increases in electricity costs (projected ~ 38% by 2028), and broader reliability challenges. Furthermore, the group notes that hundreds of energy storage projects are currently stalled in PJM’s interconnection queue, with regulatory, permitting, and market design barriers delaying critical deployment.

Energy storage is positioned as a bridging technology that complements most renewable generation by delivering dispatchable power during peak demand, smoothing variability, and helping avoid costly infrastructure overbuild. The report urges state and PJM policymakers to streamline interconnection processes, reform market rules to properly value storage services, clarify transmission charge allocations, and modernize permitting standards.

For Maryland counties, the expansion of energy storage carries direct and growing implications. Storage projects can help stabilize local grids and reduce strain on distribution infrastructure. Still, these systems come with new public safety risks, and should they fail, they can create a serious local or regional crisis.

Sure, thousands of drivers now have access to Tesla Supercharging, but I’d wager that most real EV drivers won’t really ever use them.","For years, it was assumed by many in the car industry that concerns about the charging network were the sole reason why Tesla was seeing such runaway success. After all, Tesla had successfully convinced its customers that its cars and charging network came with almost no compromises—that they could be used just like gas vehicles. And if other EVs couldn’t offer the same experience, they were essentially destined to fail.

This is kind of the whole reason why we’ve got a switch en masse to Tesla’s power plug, known as the North American Charging Standard (NACS). A few deals and handshakes a couple of years ago, and now virtually every EV brand has made the switch to the plug, with the goal of gaining access to Tesla’s Supercharger network.

Charging could then be seamless, everywhere, powered by a slimmer plug instead of a bulky CCS unit, and actually work on the first attempt. Finally, I wouldn’t have to hear anyone say they’d never buy an EV until they could use the “Tesla Plug”. Here you go, damn you, every collective automaker told consumers who were on the fence about buying an EV. We even gave it a big award here at InsideEVs last year.

And yet, as the initial crop of NACS-equipped cars makes their way to roads, and we get our hands on them for more than just an afternoon drive, I don’t know if the change was as dramatic as everyone insisted it’d be. This month, I’ve driven three cars with native NACS plugs: the Lucid Gravity, the 2026 Nissan Leaf and the updated Kia EV6. And I am not convinced that NACS is the lifesaver we thought it would be.

In fact, it made things a bit harder.

My first run-in with native NACS outside of Tesla came via the new Kia EV6 facelift. It’s not just a new plug, either. Kia went out of its way to make sure it’s Tesla Supercharger-ready, moving the rear-mounted port from the passenger side to the driver’s side, like on a Model Y or a Model 3.

I had the EV6 press tester delivered from Detroit to Ohio, where I live. And as I usually do, I asked the fleet drivers not to recharge it during the trip so I could do my own 10% to 80% charging test later.

Yet, about 45 minutes before the EV6 was to show up at my door, I got a call.

The driver of the EV6 got nervous. About 30 miles away from my house, he called asking if I knew of a place where he could charge. He was at about 21%, enough to make it to my front door, but I can understand why the lack of range would cause trepidation for a fleet driver driving freeway speeds.

After a short conversation, I ascertained that either Kia or the fleet company itself had only given him a NACS to J1772 charging adapter. That would allow him to plug the EV6 into any slower, Level 2 charger, but he’d need a different adapter to use a non-Tesla DC fast-charger—and he didn’t have one.

There was a Tesla supercharging station somewhat on his journey, but he had no Tesla app account and would have needed to pay with a special corporate card that wasn’t set up for Tesla Supercharging.

I told him to take it slow and continue to drive. With luck, he got the EV6 to me at 8%; not bad, but I can only imagine how nerve-racking that was.

This may sound like a narrow and very specific use case, the kind of thing that won’t happen to most EV drivers. In reality, it’s more of the same: be prepared. Know where your stations are. Make sure you have the right equipment, which in this case is various adapters. Is that really any easier than before? Plus, there’s the fact that not all Tesla Supercharger stations are open to all non-Tesla EVs; you won’t know this until you fire up the app, but many stations remain exclusive to the home team.

While in my possession, the EV6 was locked out of all my traditional DC fast charging test spots, forcing me to either go significantly out of my way to a new Ionna charging station or use a Tesla Supercharger. Also, the EV6’s famously high charging speeds are limited when using the Supercharger; tack on an extra 10 to 15 minutes of charging time if you do.

Most drivers do (and should) use Level 2 charging, either at home or in public, and reconfiguring a car’s charging port to cater to what is kind of a niche experience for most EV owners seems weird. I shudder to picture the confusion of a NACS-native car that pulls up to a J1772 Level 2 charging station from ChargePoint or something, only to realize they can’t plug in.

It sounds silly, but stuff like this adds friction and points of pain and confusion for drivers. We’re already having issues getting people to buy these things in the first place, so this just seems like it would make it worse.

It appears that on some level, Nissan agrees with me, too. The latest 2026 Nissan Leaf famously has two ports: a Tesla NACS-port for DC fast charging on one side, but also a J1772 port for Level 2 charging on the other side. It’s weird, and clearly a stopgap meant to satiate the new NACS-native push that came as a prerequisite for access to the Tesla Supercharging network.

But Nissan kept the standard port on purpose. “If you look at Level 1, Level 2 charging, the most common ports are the J1772. So instead of delaying the vehicle to be able to have AC and DC commonized into one port, we decided that in this transition period that it would be best for the customer to just have both,” said Jeff Tessmer, a senior R&D engineer at Nissan.

And he’s right. I miss my Mitsubishi i-MiEV, but my example famously did not have any DC fast charging. (Believe it or not, that was an optional add-on, once.) Before my car went to the great big graveyard in the sky, it did 75% of my daily driving. I had a routine of known charging stations that I’d frequent; Level 2 was always enough for my driving needs, since the car would be sitting for hours. I’d wager that smartly-placed Level 2 charging stations would be all anyone ever needs, save for the one-off road trip where DC fast charging would come into play.

Now, this isn’t just me deriding NACS. I think the plug shape itself has a significantly more ergonomic design compared to the bulky and unwieldy CCS. Most NACS plugs I’ve used are dead simple and easy to plug in.

And this also, unfortunately, highlights the advantage Tesla still has with charging. It’s one plug that does it all, from Destination to Superchargers. I suspect the vast majority of Tesla owners only really ever mess with J1772 adapters sometimes. Why bother with CCS when you have Superchargers everywhere? For the rest of us, we’ll still be stuck in App and Adapter Hell a bit longer.

I just am not convinced this will be the industry-saving innovation that brands and EV enthusiasts really think it will be. Sure, thousands of drivers now have access to Tesla Supercharging, but I’d wager that most real EV drivers won’t really ever use them. Because you kind of don’t need it.

Doing so could have trade-offs when it comes to energy production on site, however.
The effectiveness of the method changed depending on whether or not the mill was integrated, but all types saw reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.
Integrated mills benefitted significantly from replacing their limited fossil fuel usage with biomass, especially when electricity costs exceeded that of natural gas.

Researchers began with a simulation of mills defined by two characteristics: whether they used virgin or recycled fibers, and whether they were integrated or not. A virgin mill creates pulp and paper from fresh wood that is being used for the first time, while a recycled fiber mill re-uses readily available fibers which may have been previously processed. A mill is considered integrated if it has the capability to turn wood and other biomass into pulp and paper on site, whereas a non-integrated mill uses pulp that has been produced and dried off site.

“When looking at decarbonization, most prior studies have looked at one product or one type of mill,” said Lokendra Pal, co-author of the study and professor in the Department of Forest Biomaterials and the Department of Mechanical & Aerospace Engineering at NC State. “By building a whole-mill simulation for each of these four categories, we can capture the relative strengths and weaknesses of each. Mixing these different variables lets us understand the tradeoffs and interdependencies of operations in far more detail than has previously been available.”

Virgin integrated mills account for 30% of annual U.S. paper production and 33 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, the largest shares of both between the four types of mills. While these mills produce between 80 and 90% of their energy using waste wood sourced on site, they also typically include a natural gas boiler to provide the remaining necessary energy. Non-integrated mills, on the other hand, do not produce energy on site and rely entirely on natural gas boilers and purchased electricity for heating and drying during the paper-making process. Taken together, the paper industry accounts for 6% of the total U.S. industrial energy consumption, making it the fourth-largest industrial energy consumer.

Researchers found that by moving to electric-powered boilers, these mills could reduce their emissions by as much as 61%, potentially reaching zero net emissions. Doing so would require changes in how electricity is produced, Pal said, so that emissions from electricity production would not cancel out reductions at the mill.

“The electric system in the United States is expected to increase its share of clean and renewable energy by 2050, which would make boilers powered by that electricity much cleaner than using natural gas,” he said. “What we’ve found is that there is a path toward zero emissions for these mills, but only if that progress is made in the electrical grid.”

Researchers also examined the decarbonization effects of using energy-efficient dewatering methods like enzymatic treatments and mechanical presses to remove excess water before the thermal drying process. Drying traditionally involves jetting wet pulp on a moving wire, removing most of the water by gravity and vacuum, and then transferring the wet paper web to press rollers which mechanically squeeze out more water before the paper is passed around steam-heated metal cylinders to boil and evaporate the rest. This heating method, known as thermal drying, is the most energy-intensive part of the papermaking process.

Increasing the water removal during pressing resulted in significant energy savings and reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, said Maria E. Gonzalez, lead author and Ph.D. student in the Department of Forest Biomaterials at NC State. Doing so could have trade-offs when it comes to energy production on site, however.

“We found that each 1% of water removed before drying translated to a 3% increase in total energy efficiency for the papermaking process. However, it also meant less steam production, which is used to power turbines,” said González. “Mill operations are often interdependent, so if you change one process it may impact others. We are trying to overcome the interdependency by offering multiple strategies for mills to pick and choose from.”

The final strategy researchers analyzed was the use of low-carbon alternatives, like using waste wood in boilers instead of fossil fuels. The effectiveness of the method changed depending on whether or not the mill was integrated, but all types saw reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.

Integrated mills benefitted significantly from replacing their limited fossil fuel usage with biomass, especially when electricity costs exceeded that of natural gas. They could also opt to supplement the steam used for powering their turbines with biomass combustion. Overall, this method showed decarbonization rates of between 24 and 48%, depending on how completely the mill replaced its fossil fuels. While these numbers do not reach the emission reductions gained from full electrification, biomass is also a readily available fuel source which could provide mills with higher energy independence, Pal said.

“Looking at all three of these strategies together is a significant step toward improving the sustainability and competitive edge of the U.S. pulp and paper industry,” Pal said. “Trade-offs like this appear no matter what strategy or strategies you use. There is no one-size-fits-all answer to sustainability.”

The paper, “Advancing sustainability in the U.S. pulp and paper industry: Decarbonization through energy efficiency, electrification, low-carbon fuels, and the social cost of emissions,” is published in the Journal of Cleaner Production.

EPA states that under the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA), “comments on the information collection provisions are best assured of consideration if the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) receives a copy of your comments on or before October 23, 2025.” The proposed rule is well crafted and the changes to the risk evaluation framework are unsurprising. For more information on the amendments and our commentary, please read the full memorandum.

EPA Announces Settlements With Four Companies To Improve TRI Reporting: EPA announced on September 30, 2025, that it took action against four companies in New York, New Jersey, and Puerto Rico for failing to report the use of hazardous chemicals, as required by the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA). According to EPA, the settlements strengthen community safety by ensuring companies comply with the Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) program, “help[ing] neighborhoods stay informed about potentially dangerous substances nearby.” The settlements include the following companies:

New Jersey Galvanizing and Tinning Works (Newark, New Jersey): Failed to report nickel usage for three consecutive years. An EPA inspection in August 2024 led to a settlement of $63,800. The Company also certified its current compliance and agreed to adopt a compliance plan to help ensure future compliance;

US Polychemical Corporation (Chestnut Ridge, New York): Exceeded reporting thresholds and failed to report for glycol ethers and nonylphenol ethoxylates over three years. The Company certified its current compliance and will pay a $39,800 penalty, as well as implement a compliance plan to avoid future violations;

L.D. McCauley, LLC. (Orchard Park, New York): Did not report nitrate compounds for 2020 and 2021. After an EPA review, the Company certified to its current compliance, agreed to pay a $45,400 penalty, and will implement improved compliance measures; and

Quality Electroplating Corporation (Caguas, Puerto Rico): Submitted late reports for zinc compounds and provided inaccurate data for nitric acid and cyanide compounds. The Company certified to its current compliance, agreed to pay a penalty of $22,900, and created and will implement a plan to stay in compliance.

EPA Releases Meeting Minutes And Final SACC Report On Phthalates: EPA announced on October 6, 2025, that it released the meeting minutes and final report from the August 4-8, 2025, SACC virtual public meeting to discuss the draft risk evaluations and associated materials for the five phthalates that are currently undergoing risk evaluation under TSCA. The five phthalates are dibutyl phthalate (DBP), di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), butyl benzyl phthalate (BBP), diisobutyl phthalate (DIBP), and dicyclohexyl phthalate (DCHP). SACC peer reviewed technical support documents for all five phthalates, the draft risk evaluations for DCHP (released January 2025), and DBP and DEHP (both released June 2025). SACC also peer reviewed a draft carcinogenicity assessment and a draft cumulative risk analysis for the five phthalates. EPA states that it is in the process of reviewing feedback from the meeting, including the final report, and will use this feedback, along with feedback received from the public, to inform the final risk evaluations for DBP, DEHP, BBP, DIBP, and DCHP.

EPA Adds Additional PFAS To TRI: EPA announced on October 7, 2025, the addition of a per- and polyfluoroalkyl substance (PFAS) to the list of chemicals covered by the TRI. EPA added sodium perfluorohexanesulfonate (PFHxS-Na) to the TRI list pursuant to the Fiscal Year 2020 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). EPA states that the addition is due to EPA issuing a final toxicity value in 2025 entitled “IRIS Toxicological Review of Perfluorohexanesulfonic Acid (PFHxS, CASRN 335-46-4) and Related Salts.” EPA notes that the TRI chemical list already includes PFHxS and some of the salts identified in the assessment, but that PFHxS-Na, which is also identified in the assessment, was not on the TRI list. Accordingly, per the framework for automatic additions of PFAS provided in the 2020 NDAA, the publication of this assessment adds PFHxS-Na to the TRI list with an effective date of January 1, 2026, bringing the total number of PFAS subject to TRI reporting to 206.

LEGISLATIVE

House Bill Would Ban Diquat: On September 8, 2025, Representative Anna Paulina Luna (R-FL) introduced the Protect Our Farmers and Families Act of 2025 (H.R. 5196) to cancel the registration and prohibit all uses of diquat in the United States. Luna’s September 10, 2025, press release states that under the legislation:

All current uses of diquat will be deemed unsafe and canceled under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA);

EPA will revoke any existing food residue tolerances associated with diquat;

Sale, distribution, and use of existing stocks will be immediately prohibited; and

EPA will be barred from re-registering diquat for any future use.

Bipartisan, Bicameral Legislation Would Prohibit Manufacture And Use Of Asbestos: On September 16, 2025, Senator Jeff Merkley (D-OR) and Representatives Suzanne Bonamici (D-OR) and Don Bacon (R-NE) introduced bipartisan legislation (H.R. 5373, S. 2811) that would prohibit the manufacture, processing, use, and distribution in commerce of “all six recognized asbestos fibers,” according to Merkley’s September 16, 2025, press release. The bill would amend TSCA to prohibit the manufacture, processing, use, and distribution in commerce of commercial asbestos and mixtures and articles containing commercial asbestos. The bill defines commercial asbestos as the asbestiform varieties of the following, if extracted and processed for their commercial value: chrysotile (serpentine); crocidolite (riebeckite); amosite (cummingtonite-grunerite); anthophyllite; tremolite; actinolite; richterite; and winchite.

House Bill Would Amend FIFRA To Require More Coordination Between EPA And USDA: On September 26, 2025, Representative Jodey Arrington (R-TX), Chair of the House Budget Committee, introduced the USDA Communication Regarding Oversight of Pesticides (CROP) Act of 2025 (.R. 5564), which would require the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Office of Pest Management Policy (OPMP), “which frequently communicates with producers, to have a meaningful voice in the regulation of crop protection products.” Arrington’s September 30, 2025, press release states that:

Currently, OPMP provides feedback to EPA on the safe use of crop protection products, but EPA is not required to respond or consider OPMP’s guidance, giving EPA disproportionate input in regulation;

The CROP Act will create a more equitable balance of USDA and EPA input, ensuring that regulations reflect both producer and environmental considerations;

U.S. farmers and ranchers are coping with record inflation and broken supply chains. If these producers lose the ability to use certain crop protection products, farms will be forced to forgo conservation practices, like no-till farming, and revert to full tillage methods to control pests; and

It is vital that OPMP, which coordinates frequently with producers, has a role in this process to help EPA use the best science possible in conducting pesticide registrations and rulemakings to ensure users are not being subject to unnecessary, unscientific conditions.

Bipartisan Legislation Would Expand Access To PFAS Blood Testing For Seniors: On September 26, 2025, Representatives Debbie Dingell (D-MI) and Brian Fitzpatrick (R-PA), Co-Chairs of the bipartisan Congressional PFAS Task Force, introduced legislation (H.R. 5571) to enable Medicare beneficiaries to get blood tested for PFAS at no cost. According to Dingell’s September 26, 2025, press release, scientific studies have linked PFAS to a variety of health hazards, “including various cancers, increases in cholesterol levels, reproductive problems, as well as low birth weight and weakened childhood immunity.”

MISCELLANEOUS

ALJ Disapproves Minnesota’s Proposed PFAS Rule Package Pending Correction: As reported in our May 29, 2025, memorandum, on May 22, 2025, the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) held a public hearing on its proposed PFAS reporting rule. Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) Jim Mortenson considered the comments provided both during the hearing and in writing as he evaluated the proposed rule. His August 28, 2025, report on the proposed rule concludes that:

The proposed rule package must be disapproved for a procedural reason: MPCA failed to include an assessment of the cumulative effect of the proposed rules with federal TSCA regulations on PFAS reporting.

Based on a careful examination of the law, MPCA’s explanations, and public comments, the ALJ finds several provisions of the proposed rules that must be disapproved because they are either not rationally related to MPCA’s objective or the record does not demonstrate the need or reasonableness of the rule; exceeds, conflicts with, or does not comply with the enabling statute; and is not a rule or is otherwise not an enforceable law:

7026.0010, subp. 14 (definition of manufacturer);

7026.0040 (reporting updates);

7026.0050 (waivers);

7026.0090 (reporting exemptions); and

7026.0100 (fees).

The ALJ offers recommendations for correcting these deficiencies and suggestions for additional improvements to the proposed rules for the MPCA Commissioner to consider. More information is available in our September 26, 2025, blog item.

The evolution of wireless electric vehicle charging is backed by significant government investment and concrete international standards. This progress is setting the stage for a future where plugging in becomes a thing of the past. This in-depth analysis explores the key segments, recent technological breakthroughs, and quantitative data that illustrate the explosive potential of charging electric cars wirelessly.

New Performance Benchmarks Validate Wireless Charging's Competitive Edge

The conversation around electric vehicle wireless charging is no longer just about convenience; it is now firmly about performance. Recent tests in the wireless EV charging market have demonstrated remarkable capabilities that rival traditional methods. For instance, researchers at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) developed a system that charges a Hyundai Kona Electric with 100 kW of power. This was achieved at a breakthrough 96% efficiency. The system successfully transferred this power across a 5-inch airgap, adding a 50% charge in just 20 minutes.

Moreover, an earlier benchtop test achieved an even higher 120 kW of power with 97% efficiency. This performance is 8 to 10 times the power density of previous technologies. Systems are now being developed across a range of power levels, with some wireless charging companies like Plugless Power offering 3.6 kW to 7.2 kW systems, while the 11 kW to 50 kW segment sees major development.

The delegation, comprised of Ranking Republican on the Senate Energy Committee Mario R. Mattera (2nd Senate District), Senator Anthony Palumbo (1st Senate District), Senator Dean Murray (3rd Senate District), Senator Steven Rhoads (5th Senate District), Senator Jack Martins (7th Senate District), Senator Alexis Weik (8th Senate District), and Senator Patricia Canzoneri-Fitzpatrick (9th Senate District), emphasized in their letter that NESE represents a strategic investment in the state’s energy future, with measurable economic and environmental benefits.
“The NESE project is about more than energy—it’s about jobs, reliability, and keeping Long Island’s economy strong,” said Senator Mattera.
Governor Hochul should move this project forward without delay.” ""The Northeast Supply Enhancement Project is a smart, forward-thinking investment in New York's future.

This project is an essential energy infrastructure initiative that would strengthen New York’s energy reliability, stimulate the economy, and advance environmental sustainability goals.

The delegation, comprised of Ranking Republican on the Senate Energy Committee Mario R. Mattera (2nd Senate District), Senator Anthony Palumbo (1st Senate District), Senator Dean Murray (3rd Senate District), Senator Steven Rhoads (5th Senate District), Senator Jack Martins (7th Senate District), Senator Alexis Weik (8th Senate District), and Senator Patricia Canzoneri-Fitzpatrick (9th Senate District), emphasized in their letter that NESE represents a strategic investment in the state’s energy future, with measurable economic and environmental benefits.

The NESE project is projected to increase New York’s natural gas capacity by approximately 13%, addressing the growing demand from residents, small businesses, and emerging industries such as artificial intelligence–driven data centers. This increase in capacity would help ensure system resilience amid extreme weather events and potential supply disruptions.

Economically, NESE represents a $1 billion direct investment, expected to generate $548 million in economic activity, produce nearly $37 million in state and local tax revenue, and support approximately 2,000 direct and indirect jobs—including 1,200 construction jobs. The project is also anticipated to deliver $230 million in wages and benefits to New York’s workforce.

“The NESE project is about more than energy—it’s about jobs, reliability, and keeping Long Island’s economy strong,” said Senator Mattera. “This project will create thousands of good-paying union jobs for our hardworking men and women of labor, help protect consumers from rising energy costs, and ensure our communities have the stable, affordable energy they need for years to come. Governor Hochul should move this project forward without delay.”

""The Northeast Supply Enhancement Project is a smart, forward-thinking investment in New York's future. It not only creates thousands of good-paying union jobs, but also provides environmental benefits, and strengthens our energy infrastructure. I urge Governor Hochul to support this critical, common-sense project that will help keep New York's energy system reliable and strong,"" stated Senator Murray.

“This project is about ensuring Long Island and New York have the reliable energy infrastructure we need to power our homes and businesses. The NESE project is a smart investment in our future that strengthens our economy and supports good-paying jobs,” added Senator Canzoneri-Fitzpatrick.

“The Northeast Supply Enhancement Project is a common sense investment in our energy infrastructrue that will increase the supply of clean, efficient natural gas for our homes, our communities and our economy. The governor needs to support this vital project,” said Senator Weik.

""The NESE project is a direct investment in our working families and local workforce,” added Senator Steven Rhoads. “Long Islanders expect and deserve safe, affordable and dependable energy options, especially as the cost of living continues rise. This project offers real relief — delivering long-term savings, diversifying our energy portfolio, and creating thousands of good-paying union jobs. A recent bipartisan poll shows that 72% of New Yorkers support new natural gas pipelines like NESE, 84% see natural gas as a reliable energy source, and 76% consider it affordable. It’s time to make energy decisions based upon affordability and common sense. Governor Hochul should listen to her constituents and make NESE a priority for New York’s future.”

Independent analysis cited in the letter indicates NESE could save New Yorkers up to $6 billion in electricity costs over the next 15 years, with nearly half of those savings benefitting downstate residents.

Additionally, by reducing reliance on diesel-fueled truck deliveries of liquefied natural gas (LNG), the project is expected to cut greenhouse gas emissions and decrease oil dependence—advancing New York’s broader environmental objectives.

The delegation’s letter concludes with a call for the Governor’s timely action, emphasizing that New Yorkers deserve an energy system that is reliable, affordable, and environmentally responsible.",https://www.nysenate.gov/sites/default/files/2025/10/15/nese-map-875x548.jpg,N,,2025-10-16 01:59:46.182582

In Việt Nam, six national greenhouse gas inventories have been conducted, showing the government's determination to transparently report emission data and fulfill international obligations.
Agriculture accounts for a large proportion of the total national emissions, primarily from paddy cultivation, livestock farming, and fertilizer use.
In livestock farming, Nghệ An, together with TH Group, has pioneered the trend of green production, applying high technology and reducing emissions.

This was the key theme of the training programme ""Enhancing Media Capacity for Carbon Neutrality"" organised by the Ministry of Agriculture and Environment on October 15.

According to Assoc. Prof., Dr. Mai Văn Trịnh, Director of the Institute of Agricultural Environment, climate change is affecting all sectors, with agriculture being both impacted and a major source of emissions.

“Measuring and managing greenhouse gas emissions is an essential requirement for moving towards a green, sustainable agriculture,” said Dr. Trịnh.

In Việt Nam, six national greenhouse gas inventories have been conducted, showing the government's determination to transparently report emission data and fulfill international obligations. Agriculture accounts for a large proportion of the total national emissions, primarily from paddy cultivation, livestock farming, and fertilizer use.

Greenhouse gas emissions not only affect the environment but also directly impact the productivity, quality, and reputation of Vietnamese agricultural products in the international market. The EU, Japan, and the United States have all established carbon standards as technical barriers.

""If we do not proactively control [emissions], Vietnamese agriculture will lose opportunities in the global supply chain,"" he said.

Measurement, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) of emissions is the ""backbone"" of modern carbon governance.

2025 marks a significant turning point as the Government approved the Scheme to establish a domestic carbon market under Decision 232/QD-TTg. The pilot phase from 2025-2028 aims for the official operation of the carbon exchange from 2029, allowing organisations and enterprises to trade and buy/sell ""carbon credits"" – equivalent to 1 ton of reduced CO₂ emissions.

Additionally, Decree 119/2025/ND-CP has just been issued, supplementing and perfecting the legal framework for the carbon market. It clearly stipulates the responsibilities of ministries, sectors, localities, and enterprises in inventorying and reporting emissions, while also encouraging voluntary and innovative models in emission reduction and carbon absorption.

""If MRV and carbon market participation are handled well, Vietnamese agriculture will not only contribute to achieving the Net Zero 2050 commitment but also open up new revenue streams from carbon credits, providing farmers and businesses with additional motivation to invest in green production,"" said Dr. Trịnh.

As carbon becomes a measurable and tradable ""asset,"" Vietnamese agriculture needs to transform quickly. Investing in emission measurement technology, circular economy models, and international standard MRV will be key for Việt Nam to affirm its position in the global green economy.

According to Deputy Director of the ministry’s Department of Climate Change Nguyễn Tuấn Quang Việt Nam has finalised many important policies to achieve carbon neutrality. The Prime Minister’s Decision No 896/QD-TTg of 2022 approved the National Strategy on Climate Change to 2050, setting a net-zero emissions target by 2050.

On that basis, ministries, sectors, and localities have specified these commitments through action plans, technical guidelines, and management mechanisms. The Ministry of Industry and Trade and the Ministry of Construction have issued circulars on technical standards and energy management, while the Ministry of Agriculture and Environment coordinates in developing national reports and action plans to implement the Net Zero commitment.

From a local perspective, Deputy Director of Nghệ An Province's Department of Agriculture and Environment Nguyễn Danh Hùng, stated that the locality has proactively applied sustainable development solutions, adapted to climate change, and reduced methane emissions in agriculture. Specifically, Nghệ An is focusing on promoting low-emission agricultural and forestry production models, contributing towards the carbon neutrality goal.

The forestry sector is significantly benefiting as Nghệ An is among the localities with the largest forest area nationwide, boasting over 1.036 million hectares, including 790,000ha of natural forest.

The province has been selected to participate in the North Central Region's Emission Reduction Payment Agreement (ERPA) programme for the 2023–2025 period, with over 38,400 forest owners receiving payments from carbon credits. This model is likened to ""a rain shower in the dry season,"" helping locals improve their livelihoods while raising awareness about forest protection.

In livestock farming, Nghệ An, together with TH Group, has pioneered the trend of green production, applying high technology and reducing emissions. Two key enterprises of TH Group have been certified as carbon neutral by Control Union (Netherlands) according to international standard PAS 2060:2014.

“This is a testament to the vision of ""green agriculture – circular economy – sustainable development,"" while also paving the way for other businesses,” said Hùng.

Additionally, the province is collaborating with pioneering enterprises such as Green Carbon and Faeger to implement a low-emission rice production project, applying the ""alternate wetting and drying"" technique on over 19,000ha, creating a premise for low-carbon agricultural production. VNS

Estimated Federal Cost The estimated budgetary effect of S. 688 is shown in Table 1.
Basis of Estimate CBO assumes that S. 688 will be enacted by the end of calendar year 2025 and that the authorized and necessary amounts will be available in each year.
S. 688 would authorize the appropriation of $112 million annually from 2026 through 2031 for the National Sea Grant College Program.
S. 688 contains no intergovernmental mandates as defined in UMRA.","Bill Summary

S. 688 would reauthorize the National Sea Grant College Program until September 30, 2031. In addition, the bill would authorize appropriations for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and other federal agencies to expand enforcement of regulations against illegal, unreported, or unregulated (IUU) fishing and establish and maintain a blacklist of foreign vessels involved in those activities. The bill would increase sanctions and penalties for violators and would require agencies to track the use of forced labor on those vessels.

Estimated Federal Cost

The estimated budgetary effect of S. 688 is shown in Table 1. The costs of the legislation fall within budget function 300 (natural resources and environment).

Basis of Estimate

CBO assumes that S. 688 will be enacted by the end of calendar year 2025 and that the authorized and necessary amounts will be available in each year.

Spending Subject to Appropriation

Based on historical spending patterns, CBO estimates that implementing the bill would cost $587 million over the 2026-2030 period.

National Sea Grant College Program. S. 688 would authorize the appropriation of $112 million annually from 2026 through 2031 for the National Sea Grant College Program. That program is a partnership between NOAA and 34 universities that focuses on research, conservation, and the effective use of U.S. coastal resources. In 2024, the Congress provided $80 million for the program. CBO estimates that implementing the provision would cost $489 million over the 2026-2030 period and $175 million after 2030, assuming appropriation of the authorized amounts.

Enforcement of Illegal-Fishing Regulations and Blacklisting Violators. S. 688 would authorize the appropriation of $20 million annually from 2026 through 2030 for NOAA, in coordination with Customs and Border Protection, and the Departments of Labor and State, to expand enforcement of regulations against IUU fishing.

Under the bill, NOAA would maintain and publish a blacklist of foreign vessels that violate IUU‑fishing regulations and that are identified as using forced labor in those activities. The agency also would be directed to issue regulations for adding vessels to and removing them from the list.

S. 688 also would authorize $4 million for the National Academy of Sciences to study the use of forced labor in IUU fishing, the costs to the global economy of those activities, and the effectiveness of strategies for deterring them.

CBO estimates that implementing those provisions would cost $91 million over the 2026‑2030 period and $12 million after 2030, assuming appropriation of the authorized amounts.

Administrative Costs. Using information from the agencies, CBO estimates that implementing S. 688 would cost NOAA $4 million in the first year to develop a strategy to increase IUU-fishing inspection and enforcement programs, to coordinate with other federal agencies and regional fisheries management organizations, and to collect and analyze data and prepare reports. Thereafter, costs would total about $1 million annually for enforcement and increased screening of seafood imports. CBO estimates that those activities would cost a total of $7 million over the 2026‑2030 period; any related spending would be subject to the availability of appropriated funds.

Direct Spending and Revenues

S. 688 would allow the Administration to impose sanctions on any foreign persons or entities engaging in IUU fishing. CBO estimates that enacting the bill would have an insignificant effect on direct spending and revenues over the 2026-2035 period stemming from the sanctions the bill would authorize.

Under current law, the Administration can sanction foreign persons and entities that engage in corruption, including IUU fishing. If the enactment of S. 688 leads the Administration to broaden those sanctions, more people would be denied visas by the Department of State, resulting in an insignificant decrease in revenues from visa fees. Although most visa fees are retained by the Department of State and spent, some collections are deposited in the Treasury as revenues. Denying foreign nationals entry into the United States also would reduce direct spending on federal benefits (emergency Medicaid or federal subsidies for health insurance, for example) for which those people might otherwise be eligible.

The bill would block transactions involving certain assets either in the United States or under the control of people or entities in the United States. Under the bill, any person or entity violating those prohibitions would be subject to civil or criminal monetary penalties. Such penalties are recorded as revenues, and a portion can be spent without further appropriation.

Using data from similar sanctions, CBO estimates that any additional sanctions imposed under the bill would affect a small number of people. Thus, enacting S. 688 would have insignificant effects on revenues and direct spending, and would, on net, reduce deficits by insignificant amounts over the 2026-2035 period.

Pay-As-You-Go Considerations

The Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010 establishes budget-reporting and enforcement procedures for legislation affecting direct spending or revenues. CBO estimates that enacting the bill would change direct spending and revenues by less than $500,000 over the 2026‑2035 period.

Increase in Long-Term Net Direct Spending and Deficits

CBO estimates that enacting S. 688 would not increase net direct spending or on-budget deficits in any of the four consecutive 10-year periods beginning in 2036.

Mandates

S. 688 would impose a private-sector mandate as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA) by expanding the scope of authority for the Administration to regulate transactions between entities in the United States and foreign entities and officials of foreign governments who would be subject to sanctions under the bill. That expansion would result in additional burdens on individuals and entities, such as banks, in the United States that are required to monitor and report on foreign transactions and to block access to certain assets owned by sanctioned entities. Such an expansion also would prohibit transactions between entities in the United States and sanctioned parties that otherwise would be permitted under current law.

The cost of the mandate would be any income or profit lost as a result of the bill’s enactment. CBO expects that because a small number of people or entities would be affected, the loss of income from any incremental increase in restrictions imposed by the bill would be small as well. CBO estimates that the cost of the mandate would fall well below the annual threshold established in UMRA for private-sector mandates ($206 million in 2025, adjusted annually for inflation).

S. 688 contains no intergovernmental mandates as defined in UMRA.

Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a critical part of maintaining and growing the manufacturing industry in our state.","BATON ROUGE, La. (Louisiana First) — Gov. Jeff Landry declared a moratorium on new carbon capture injection wells applications in Louisiana on Wednesday.

The Louisiana Department of Conservation and Energy is ordered to reevaluate the status of Class VI permit applications over the next 45 days. Landry explained that the order is to give residents and local officials a “clear roadmap” to ensure that applications for proposed projects follow state rules for carbon injection and carbon dioxide pipelines.

Landry said it is necessary that the department can take a methodical approach to application review and permitting, with safety for people and the environment in mind.

Industry groups release statements

Statement from the Louisiana Association of Business and Industry.

“Louisiana’s energy sector is the envy of the nation and the world. The expertise and talent of our workforce, combined with the state’s abundant natural resources, make the state a global destination for energy investment and innovation. LABI’s commitment to ensuring that Louisiana remains a top destination for investment, technological advancement and job creation is ironclad.

“While this appears to be a shared goal of the Landry administration, today’s executive

order on carbon capture and sequestration sends the wrong message. The order risks

ceding Louisiana’s competitive advantage to neighboring states eager to move forward with CCS investments.

“Carbon capture and sequestration is a key piece to growing and retaining the high-wage energy, industrial and manufacturing jobs that sustain Louisiana families, while also ensuring the long-term viability of our state’s oil, gas and petrochemical industries.

“Louisiana has already secured billions of dollars in CCS-related investments from

companies committed to delivering products and energy safely and efficiently with a lower carbon footprint. These projects generate millions in local tax revenue, supporting infrastructure improvements, school upgrades and economic development in communities.

“The momentum Louisiana has built is no accident. It is the direct result of securing state primacy and leveraging our unique geology, world-class energy infrastructure and highly skilled workforce. Together, these advantages have positioned Louisiana as a global leader in the energy marketplace. By injecting uncertainty and regulatory hurdles into this process, we stand to undo all the progress that state leaders have touted for months.

“We cannot yield our position to states like Texas that stand ready to capture these same opportunities. CCS represents a chance to strengthen Louisiana’s energy sector and make us the energy giant of the future we know we can be.

“LABI stands ready to work with the Landry administration and President Trump to ensure Louisiana secures our energy future, creating good-paying jobs and thriving local communities for generations to come. This shared vision can only be realized by building on our existing resources and embracing innovative technologies like carbon capture and sequestration, sending a clear message: Louisiana is open for business.”

Statement from the Louisiana Chemical Association.

“The Louisiana Chemical Association appreciates Governor Landry’s focus on public safety, environmental stewardship, and economic growth. We share his commitment to responsible industrial development and community engagement, and we value the Administration’s broader efforts to establish Louisiana as a premier place for business investments. To that end, our industry has already committed over $60 billion to projects that depend on carbon capture and storage.

“That is why we are concerned that a conditional moratorium on new Class VI permit applications, as announced today, sends the wrong message to the market at a pivotal moment for Louisiana’s economy. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a critical part of maintaining and growing the manufacturing industry in our state. A pause on applications, regardless of the reasoning, signals uncertainty for projects that enable lower-emissions production, support thousands of high-wage jobs, and encourage future reinvestment.

“Louisiana earned federal approval to run its own Class VI program so that permitting could be rigorous, predictable, and efficient here at home. That hard-won primacy, and the state’s recent issuance of its first Class VI permit, demonstrate that Louisiana can safely develop these projects in a way that protects communities and natural resources while continuing to encourage industrial investment in the state. A moratorium undermines that predictability at the very time companies are making multi-billion-dollar, multi-decade siting decisions.

“LCA remains committed to working with the Governor, state agencies, and local officials to address concerns and deliver the environmental and economic benefits made possible by CCS projects in the state. Louisiana should proudly lead the nation in safe, responsible industrial decarbonization rather than signaling hesitation that allows other states to seize this opportunity.”

Statement from the Louisiana Oil and Gas Association.

“We respectfully disagree with the Governor‘s decision to halt the review of any new CCUS applications.

“We are thankful that the Governor didn’t cancel existing CCUS projects, which will continue to prove how safe this technology actually is, and we encourage industry to continue moving forward with the hope that the Governor will lift this moratorium sooner rather than later.

“For 75+ years Louisiana’s regulatory arm has safely authorized and governed injection wells. AND for 40+ years through Enhanced Oil Recovery, the Department has safely regulated the injection of CO2. In fact, since 2010, over 47 billion metric tons of CO2 have been safely injected and ultimately stored in Louisiana formations.

“Carbon capture is a proven tool that will bring significant economic development and new opportunities to our state and our country, and we remain committed to advancing these benefits for Louisiana.”

Statement from American Petroleum Institute Gulf Coast Region Director Gifford Briggs.

“We share the governor’s goal of addressing the backlog of CCS project applications, but an indefinite moratorium undermines Louisiana’s energy leadership and sets a precedent that could discourage development and innovation across the Gulf Coast and the nation. This executive order creates uncertainty that could delay projects, and send jobs and opportunities elsewhere. Now, Louisiana’s leadership role in American energy security is in jeopardy.”

The decision has left the 3,000 workers at the Brampton plant in limbo as they wait to hear future plans.
“Americans don’t want to buy cars that are made in Canada,” Trump said.
Unifor national president Lana Payne said the federal government needs to do all it can to defend the Brampton plant, the auto sector and other industries feeling the weight of tariffs.
“If the U.S. turns Canada into its enemy, the automotive industry of Canada will look elsewhere for partners.”","The federal government threatened legal action after carmaker Stellantis said it will move planned vehicle production from its plant in Brampton, Ont., to Illinois, sparking fears about the future of Canada’s auto industry as U.S. President Donald Trump tries to undo 60 years of integration.

Industry Minister Melanie Joly expressed her “extreme concern” about the move in a letter Wednesday to the company where she threatened legal action.

“The business decision to move the mandate of the Jeep Compass is unacceptable,” she said in the letter, a copy of which was obtained by CityNews.

She said the company had agreed to maintain its full Canadian footprint, including Brampton operations, in exchange for substantial financial support over decades. It refers to the 2009 government bailouts of the auto sector during the financial crisis when Stellantis was on “the brink of bankruptcy.”

“Anything short of fulfilling that commitment will be considered as default.”

Stellantis said in a statement that it has plans for the Brampton plant, but didn’t provide any details on what those might be.

The company also said it continues to invest in Canada, including adding a third shift to the Windsor Assembly Plant where it produces the Chrysler Pacifica minivan and Dodge Charger.

“Canada is very important to us,” said Stellantis spokeswoman LouAnn Gosselin in a statement.

Ontario Premier Doug Ford said the company has told him they’re going to keep the plant, but that reopening will be delayed as they figure out which vehicle they’ll produce there.

He said he’s told the company how disappointed he is in the decision, and that the company won’t be getting any more funding until it fulfils its obligations.

“I’m not going to give them a penny,” Ford said Wednesday.

Stellantis announced the decision as part of a US$13-billion spending commitment in the U.S. that will see it boost production in the country by 50 per cent over the next four years.

The decision has left the 3,000 workers at the Brampton plant in limbo as they wait to hear future plans.

Joly said the company will have to extend supports for those workers until at least 2027 in light of the latest decision.

Opposition Leader Pierre Poilievre said the government was failing to protect autoworkers.

“After promising to ‘negotiate a win’ with President Trump and giving billions in handouts to the company, the elbows-down Prime Minister got no job guarantees for autoworkers,” he said in a statement.

Prime Minister Mark Carney met with Trump in Washington last week, where the president showed no signs of relenting on tariffs. He said the U.S. wants to make its own steel and autos and warned that Canada and the U.S. have “natural” business conflicts.

“Americans don’t want to buy cars that are made in Canada,” Trump said. “It’s a tough situation because we want to make our cars here. At the same time, we want Canada to do well making cars. So, we’re working on formulas and I think we’ll get there.”

Joly said on Wednesday the federal government will work to hold Stellantis to account.

“We will fight for these jobs,” she told reporters following a fireside chat in Fredericton.

“I’ll continue to work night and day on this issue.”

The loss of a committed vehicle makes the outlook for Brampton more dire, and the need to find new partners beyond U.S. automakers more pressing, said Greig Mordue, associate professor at McMaster University’s W Booth School of Engineering.

“Any reasonable person looking at the status of Brampton could probably look at it and say, that’s in tough shape, and frankly, yesterday’s announcement made it even tougher.”

Production at the plant ended in late December 2023 and retooling began in January 2024 to prepare for the Jeep Compass. After Trump started rolling out tariffs earlier this year, the company halted work on retooling in February.

The latest decision by Stellantis follows on several moves by Detroit automakers to delay or cut back production in Canada, as tariffs come in and electric vehicle adoption has been slower than expected.

General Motors idled its CAMI assembly plant that produces EV delivery trucks in Ingersoll, Ont., for months this year and is moving to a single shift there. The company is also set to cut a shift at its Oshawa plant in January. Meanwhile, Ford last year shifted plans for its Oakville assembly plant that will see production delayed.

“The reality is those U.S. automakers have almost abandoned Canada. I mean, they’ve got a plant in Windsor, and a declining plant in Oshawa making vehicles. That’s it,” said Mordue.

Given the current situation, he said it’s time Canada look to potentially try and attract rising auto producers, especially from China, if it wants to maintain the sector long-term.

Unifor national president Lana Payne said the federal government needs to do all it can to defend the Brampton plant, the auto sector and other industries feeling the weight of tariffs.

“Targeted Canadian industries are already experiencing the financial impact and job losses due to Trump’s sustained attacks,” she said in a statement.

“Stellantis cannot be allowed to renege on its commitments to Canadian workers, and governments cannot stand by while our jobs are shifted to the United States.”

Flavio Volpe, head of the Automotive Parts Manufacturers’ Association, said parts suppliers that have invested hundreds of millions of dollars to supply the Brampton plant only found out about the decision through the news.

He said the cowardly decision also puts in doubt the jobs of some 10,000 workers at parts suppliers are also relying on Brampton getting a product.

“It’s not OK,” said Volpe.

“Canadians have been committed to investing in the auto sector because they trust these companies to follow through.”

He said he doesn’t put much stock in the company’s vague commitments for Brampton.

“I’ve been around long enough to know a plan and a car are two different things.”

While the company says it remains committed to Canada, the decision dilutes the potential of the Brampton plant going forward, said Sam Fiorani, vice-president of global vehicle forecasting at AutoForecast Solutions.

“A move like this falls right into the hands of the Trump administration’s desire to move product to the U.S.”

He said that given the company’s announcement to build so many other vehicles in the U.S., it looks like the Windsor plant is still at least needed.

The wider concern is the fragmenting of the North American auto industry will weaken the sectors in all three countries, said Fiorani.

“Canada, U.S., and Mexico made a great team on the global market, and none of those countries is large enough or strong enough to compete with the likes of China and the EU.”

He said that if the U.S. keeps moving forward with shutting out Canada’s auto sector, then it might make sense to look to partner with Chinese manufacturers that have been looking at Canada for over a decade.

The new guidance from the state Department of Conservation and Energy is part of a concerted effort to prioritize carbon capture projects and implement a new law requiring more local input in the regulatory process.

The six priority projects are:

Capio Sherburne CCS Well No. 1 in Pointe Coupee Parish.

CCS 2 - Wilcox by CapturePoint in Vernon Parish.

Goose Lake by Gulf Coast Sequestration in Calcasieu Parish.

Minerva by Gulf Coast Sequestration in Cameron Parish.

Louisiana Green Fuels Columbia in Caldwell Parish.

River Parish Sequestration - RPN 1 in Ascension Parish.

On Sept. 1, Tyler Gray, Gov. Jeff Landry's outgoing energy secretary, directed staff to focus on those projects to efficiently allocate department resources.

Agency officials say it takes about 2,000 man-hours to review an application but are trying to have them reviewed within two years of submission.

Dustin Davidson, who took over as energy secretary after Gray, is following through on the directive, according to a department spokesman. Davidson was deputy secretary under Gray.

In an interview Wednesday, Davidson said the six projects selected had the best economics and the least amount of ""leak paths.""

One of the key points of review on carbon capture and sequestration projects is how well underground formations can hold carbon dioxide and how many faults, old wells and other underground penetrations exist that could provide a route for stored CO2 to escape.

""That is what allows us to determine that those are good projects to move forward with and prioritize,"" Davidson said. ""We will continue to do that process moving forward in terms of identifying, again, the safest in terms of the amount of leak paths and the best economic value to the state and to the local communities.""

All of the six, except for the two by Gulf Coast Sequestration, have been in technical review by the department since the spring of 2024. The review stage is the last but also one of the lengthiest steps before projects go to public hearings and receive final consideration.

Though industry groups have criticized a new executive order that laid out the administration's plans for reviewing carbon capture and sequestration projects, one of the companies on the department's short list welcomed the news.

CapturePoint Solutions' CENLA Hub in Vernon Parish is on the short list. Officials said they appreciated Landry's establishment of a clear, responsible framework for carbon management and storage in Louisiana.

""This is a major step forward for the CENLA Hub and for Louisiana’s carbon management future,"" said Greg Harper, CapturePoint president and CEO. ""We’re pleased that Louisiana recognizes the CENLA Hub as an industry leader – designed for safety, environmental protection, economic development and genuine community partnership.”

The $5 billion hub would support more than 55 permanent high-paying jobs and more than 500 construction jobs, the company says.

Projects that rely on the storage site could generate up to $17 billion in new industrial facilities and carbon capture equipment, creating more than 800 additional full-time jobs.

Those combined investments would support regional industries like paper, pulp, manufacturing and energy, the company says.

But the state's top short list leaves off other applications by the same companies in different or even the same parishes.

Other projects that have generated considerable controversy were also left off the list, including Air Products' proposed injection field in Lake Maurepas. Projects proposed in Allen Parish by ExxonMobil's and Occidental's carbon capture subsidiaries did not make the list; neither did a project by Occidental in Livingston Parish.

Davidson said some projects have generated significant public concern because work started happening before local officials even knew what was happening.

In the third quarter of 2025, “zero-emission vehicles” (as defined by the California Energy Commission) accounted for 29.1% of new car sales, the highest quarterly sales share ever recorded in the state.

Now, the CEC’s definition of ZEVs is a little different than the one the rest of us use—it includes both battery EVs and plug-in hybrids. If we de-hype their figures, we find that battery EVs achieved a 25% market share in the 3rd quarter (and 21% year-to-date). That’s still a record, and still impressive. We also find that EVs are soundly outselling PHEVs (277,444 vs 48,085 YTD). (Yes, fuel cell vehicles are still around, but only in trace amounts—239 have been sold YTD.)

“This is unprecedented – we’re nearing a third of all new vehicles sold in the fourth largest economy on the planet being clean cars,” said Governor Gavin Newsom. “We’re setting new records because this state believes in innovation, not isolation. While [the federal government] sells out American innovation to China, California will keep charging ahead on our path to a future of cleaner air.”

“This is a defining moment for California’s ZEV progress and sends a clear message to Washington: ZEVs are here to stay,” said California Energy Commissioner Nancy Skinner.

Other stats back up Ms. Skinner’s assertion: In Q1 of this year, there were 146 ZEV models available in the state, compared to 105 models in Q1 of last year.

We’re setting new records because this state believes in innovation, not isolation,"" said Gov. Gavin Newsom in a statement. ""While Trump sells out American innovation to China, California will keep charging ahead on our path to a future of cleaner air.”

Federal tax credits cut in 'Big Beautiful Bill'

The recent surge in ZEV purchases is attributed to the Sept. 30 expiration of the federal tax credit, which offered up to $7,500 for new EVs and $4,000 for used models.

Originally set to expire in 2032 as part of the Inflation Reduction Act, the Biden-era incentives were eliminated in HR 1 - ""The Big Beautiful Bill,"" signed by President Trump in July.

The lapsed federal tax credits meant significant savings to consumers, as reported by EnergySage. A $7,500 credit represented a 13% discount towards the $57,245 average cost of a new electric vehicle in August, according to Kelly Blue Book.

""Despite the efforts by the Trump administration to derail the ZEV industry and raise the cost of a clean car, Californians made it clear they want to drive ZEVs as they scooped up the remaining federal tax credits that expired at the end of last month,"" the California governor's statement continued.

Are there any EV tax credits still available?

While no federal tax credits exist and the popular California Clean Vehicle Rebate Project expired in 2023, grants and rebates are available for low-income Californians to purchase ZEVs, with information available at ClimateAction.ca.gov or ElectricForAll.org.

Californians may also find EV purchase incentives depending on where they live.

Generally offered by utility providers, the rebates vary in amount and scope. For example, Los Angeles Department of Water and Power customers can get rebates up to $4,000 on used electric or plug-in hybrid vehicles.

The San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District's Drive Clean in the San Joaquin Rebate Program provides rebates up to $3,000 to Valley residents and businesses to purchase or lease new, clean-air vehicles.

Rebates are not always guaranteed, can change, or programs can run out of funds, so a good rule of thumb is to regularly check your local utility or district for the most up-to-date information.

Where to find reliable EV chargers

If you are about to buy an EV or are one of the millions of Californians who already own one, finding a reliable charging station will be at your mind.

In California, there are now over 200,000 publicly accessible EV charging stations, announced the state last month.

Their state is also about to get a whole lot more.

The California Energy Commission also recently approved two National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Program projects to build 64 fast EV chargers along key highway corridors.

The commission also approved three grants totaling more than $10 million that will build out more than 1,000 Level 2 EV charging ports, the vast majority in low-income, disadvantaged, or affordable multifamily housing complexes throughout the state.

EV chargers are available at grocery stores, park and ride lots, and gas stations.

Shared EV chargers can also be found at apartment complexes, workplaces, doctors’ offices, sports facilities, and other parking areas with restricted access.

The statewide network of public and shared private EV chargers is in addition to the estimated 800,000 EV chargers installed in single-family homes, according to the governor's office.

The website PlugShare has a live map of EV charging stations nationwide. You can plan your trip, and zoom in on individual charging sites to find out what type of station is available.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/oCLmrZOnd5LRYdQPZMfL5w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD05MDA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the-desert-sun/5d2f1c988227944b048665510d8808db,N,,2025-10-15 23:03:43.309006

“If federal clean energy and clean vehicle incentives are rolled back, the job growth and resurgence of clean energy manufacturing could be at risk,” the report states.
Percentage-wise, Kansas had the smallest clean energy jobs workforce, at 1.9 percent of its total workforce employed in clean energy jobs.
Breaking down the numbers The report from Clean Jobs Midwest found that energy efficiency work made up “well over half” of Iowa’s clean energy jobs.
Linn County is in second place statewide and 52nd across the Midwest with 2,778 clean energy jobs, while Scott County’s 1,886 clean energy jobs earns it the rank of 72nd across the Midwest.","The number of clean energy jobs in Iowa reached a record high in 2024, with more than 33,000 Iowans holding jobs in the clean energy space, surpassing the state’s previous record of 31,910 jobs in 2019.

Clean Jobs Midwest on Wednesday released its annual report, which tracks clean energy workforce growth across the Midwest and breaks down each state by county.

According to the report, clean energy jobs in Iowa grew six times faster than the state’s overall economy in 2024, resulting in a 2.8 percent jump — an increase of 917 workers statewide — in clean energy jobs compared to 2023.

“Clean energy’s economic role in the region is vital: the industry added jobs almost six times faster than Iowa’s overall economy, and nearly six times as many Iowans work in clean energy than the number of lawyers, web developers and real estate agents combined,” the report states.

The report also states that clean energy job growth is expected to “surge” in 2025 by about 3.6 percent.

This prediction comes as some federal clean energy programs and tax incentives — mainly created by the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act — have been repealed under the Trump administration.

“If federal clean energy and clean vehicle incentives are rolled back, the job growth and resurgence of clean energy manufacturing could be at risk,” the report states.

Of the 12 Midwest states examined in the report, Micaela Preskill, director of state advocacy for E2 — a national nonprofit organization that advocate for smart energy policies — said all states saw clean energy job growth that outpaced each state’s economy.

However, Preskill noted that clean energy job growth did slow between 2023 and 2024. From 2022 to 2023, clean energy jobs in Iowa grew by 4.5 percent.

Preskill said some of that slowdown likely was anticipation of federal changes.

“Our survey looks at jobs up until the end of 2024, and I think a lot of industries were starting to pause and adjust as we got closer to more and more federal uncertainty, and that definitely impacted the industry,” Preskill said.

The Midwest region as a whole saw a 3.9 percent increase in clean energy jobs in 2023 as well.

Of the states examined in the study — which include Iowa, Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, Wisconsin, Michigan and Ohio — Iowa is in the middle of the pack for the number of clean energy workers per state.

Of the 12 Midwest states, North Dakota has the smallest clean energy workforce, with about 9,513 workers in 2024. Illinois has the largest, with about 132,239 clean energy workers employed statewide.

Percentage-wise, Kansas had the smallest clean energy jobs workforce, at 1.9 percent of its total workforce employed in clean energy jobs. Michigan had the largest percentage at 2.9 percent of its workforce in clean energy jobs. In Iowa, 2.2 percent of the workforce holds a clean energy job.

In presenting the information Wednesday, Preskill noted that the numbers in the report reflect the number of clean energy jobs per state before federal rollbacks to clean energy funding and the approval of the Trump administration’s One Big, Beautiful Bill.

She said the report is “both a snapshot of success and a warning of what's at stake” in regard to the clean energy industry.

Breaking down the numbers

The report from Clean Jobs Midwest found that energy efficiency work made up “well over half” of Iowa’s clean energy jobs.

Researchers found that 20,153 Iowans make up the energy efficiency workforce in Iowa, completing work like manufacturing ENERGY STAR-rated appliances, installing efficient lighting, connecting heat pumps and other highly efficient heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems.

The clean vehicle energy sector — including EVs and hybrid EVs — added about 331 new jobs for 4,135 workers across Iowa in 2024. Electric vehicle jobs experienced the steepest growth rate at about 9.8 percent.

Renewable energy job growth in solar also rose by about 13 percent, and wind energy jobs grew by 1.1 percent.

In Iowa, construction work made up about 51.6 percent of clean energy jobs, while the manufacturing sector made up about 17.9 percent.

And in 2024, about 10.1 percent of Iowa’s clean energy workforce was made up of veterans.

The report breaks down clean energy jobs by county. Polk County’s 7,082 clean energy workers is the most of any county in Iowa, and ranks 18 among the counties in all 12 Midwest states.

Linn County is in second place statewide and 52nd across the Midwest with 2,778 clean energy jobs, while Scott County’s 1,886 clean energy jobs earns it the rank of 72nd across the Midwest.

Five new vehicles will be developed and produced through 2029 as part of the investment into factories in Illinois, Ohio, Michigan, and Indiana. This investment will support the production of a new four-cylinder engine and reopen the Belvidere Assembly Plant in Illinois, which will allow the automaker to expand production of the Jeep Cherokee and Jeep Compass for the U.S. market. This would also create around 5,000 jobs across the country.

Unlike previous multi-billion-dollar investments, this one does not focus on electrification. One of the five new vehicles will be a range-extended EV produced at the Warren Truck Assembly Plant in Michigan beginning in 2028.

The remaining products include a next-generation Dodge Durango that will be produced at the Detroit Assembly Complex in 2029, a new midsize truck that will be assembled at its Toledo Assembly Complex in Ohio, and an all-new four-cylinder engine called the GMET4 EVO that will go into production beginning in 2026 at its factory in Kokomo, Indiana.

Antonio Filosa, the CEO and North America COO of Stellantis, said the investment will drive the automaker’s growth, strengthen its manufacturing footprint and “bring more American jobs to the states we call home.”

“Accelerating growth in the U.S. has been a top priority since my first day. Success in America is not just good for Stellantis in the U.S. — it makes us stronger everywhere,” he said in a statement.

Reed’s view

General Motors announced in a regulatory filing Tuesday that it was taking a $1.2 billion charge on its struggling electric vehicle business.

The subtext of its filing is just how much governments at every level dictate GM’s product road map, and has similar implications for tech overall.

A few years ago, GM thought gas-powered vehicles were going to be essentially outlawed in major US markets. Now, the $7,500 tax credit that made EV economics work is going away, and emissions standards, at least in the US, are being relaxed. GM has done its share of lobbying, too.

So the automaker is slowing its EV rollout, while reckoning with steel tariffs that favor foreign rivals, even as it frets about the ascendant Chinese auto industry.

AD

GM’s woes are the product of an American industrial policy that … is clearly not working the way industrial policy is supposed to. If you’re going to dictate what products your companies make, you can’t keep changing your mind between administrations.

But that’s now happening across tech, where the previous administration fought US companies in some areas and supported them in others. The current White House has different priorities, producing a regulatory whipsaw that is going to force companies to waste money and resources — even as they hasten to praise our wise leaders, whoever they happen to be.

In this article:

Room for Disagreement

Former Ford CEO Mark Fields said on Tuesday that car companies “went full bore” into making EVs without a clear understanding of consumer demand, adding that he expects GM to take further charges in the future. “This is clearly an issue where the market didn’t develop the way automakers thought,” he added, suggesting that changing White House policies aren’t completely to blame.

Notable

GM’s 2035 goal for electric vehicles “was aspirational” and “more an idea than a strategy,” Alan Baum, an auto analyst from Detroit, told Politico. “GM’s doing a better job than many of their competitors, but there’s obviously a relatively low ceiling because of the lack of supportive policy.”

The Trump administration’s rollback of EV incentives is not all bad for GM, like for many of its legacy peers: They can now go back to relying more heavily on their internal combustion engine vehicles and keep more of the profits, Bloomberg energy columnist Liam Denning wrote.

DirecTV adds AI avatars to TV breaks for personalized shopping

OpenAI eyes Argentina for data center expansion

Talent giant CAA taps lobbyists on Hollywood AI issues

DirecTV is injecting AI avatars of users, their families, and their pets into television breaks. In partnership with Indian AI company Glance, the TV giant is creating custom screensavers and videos that users can insert themselves into using Glance’s mobile app. They can then shop the products shown in the AI-generated scenes — such as clothing their avatar is wearing — using Glance’s reverse image search technology.

Users indicate their permission by uploading photos of themselves into the Glance app. Still, the capability highlights broader privacy concerns around the integration of AI into users’ homes, personal devices, and everyday lives. It is also a step towards understanding how advertising becomes embedded into generative technologies. Glance’s AI doesn’t currently market specific products in these scenes, but it opens the door for advertisers keen on finding the next frontier for consumer engagement.

OpenAI is exploring a large-scale data center project in Argentina as part of its first Stargate initiative in Latin America, the company announced Tuesday. The proposal could see an investment of up to $25 billion into the country, equivalent to roughly 4% of its gross domestic product last year. The ChatGPT maker is working with local energy firm Sur Energy as the infrastructure developer for the planned 500-megawatt facility, which will focus on advanced AI computing.

Argentina is one of the more developed AI markets in the region, especially with respect to available infrastructure. A new report by Chile’s national AI center and the UN’s Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean ranked it sixth in the region. While much of the world’s AI focus has been concentrated on the US, Europe, and China, Latin America is becoming a global hot spot for new data center builds. The investment could help the region diversify away from commodities and position it as a key cog in the digital supply chain.

Talent representation giant Creative Artists Agency has for the first time retained external lobbyists in Washington to protect actors as AI and other issues emerge, Politico reported. The move builds on the intensified lobbying efforts by Hollywood unions and production studios in recent years, as AI threatens to supplant creative roles and challenge the intellectual property rights of established talent. CAA’s decision signals the fight in Washington may be ramping up, with new players willing to stand up to an AI-friendly Trump administration.

Hollywood has already taken issue with AI several times recently. Earlier this month, a new AI actress drew criticism from the actors’ union. OpenAI’s latest video generation tool allows users to create content that includes the intellectual property of studios, who must opt out. The AI company was also in hot water with Scarlett Johansson last year over its launch of an AI voice that she claimed sounds similar to hers.

The World

at a Glance

Apple CEO Tim Cook vowed to increase investment in China, as trade tensions between Washington and Beijing force global tech firms into a delicate balancing act.

Cook, who met with China’s tech minister on Wednesday, notched a strategic win as Chinese regulators paved the way for Apple to release its new iPhone Air next week. Apple’s new investment pledge, though, risks irking US President Donald Trump, who previously blasted Cook over plans to move more iPhone production to India, rather than the US.

Apple still makes the bulk of its phones in China, even as it reduces dependency in other arenas: The company is building a slate of home devices, including a tabletop robot, in Vietnam.

The IMF on Wednesday issued a stark warning over soaring global government debt, saying it is on track to exceed 100% of GDP by 2029.

Such a ratio would be the highest since 1948, when large economies were rebuilding post-war. Today, “there is little political appetite for belt-tightening,” The Economist wrote: Rich nations are reluctant to raise taxes on their beleaguered electorates — but they’re facing pressure to spend more on defense, and on social services for aging populations. Higher long-term bond yields, meanwhile, suggest investor wariness over governments’ balance sheets.

In the short term, the debt concerns manifest in political disruption: France’s budget fight recently toppled another government, while the US federal shutdown highlights the tension between new spending demands and deficit reduction.

Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa met Russia’s Vladimir Putin on Wednesday as the Kremlin’s influence in the Middle East wanes.

The Moscow meeting was remarkable given that Russia is harboring Syria’s former president, Bashar al-Assad, whose government was overthrown by rebels led by al-Sharaa. Putin is keen to reboot relations with Damascus to maintain his country’s military bases in Syria, analysts said. But the Kremlin’s diminishing MidEast clout was put in stark relief this week as Arab leaders rushed to Egypt for a US-led Gaza peace summit, leading Moscow to cancel a Russia-Arab conference.

“Russia has not been sidelined diplomatically in the Middle East like this since it intervened in Syria in 2015,” one analyst said.

Israel warned Tuesday it would reduce the amount of aid flowing into Gaza over Hamas’ slow release of the remains of deceased hostages.

While the Gaza ceasefire deal required the immediate handover of all remaining bodies, Hamas said destruction in the enclave has made some difficult to locate. The back-and-forth provides an early test for the tenuous truce: US President Donald Trump also heaped pressure on Hamas, saying it must disarm or “we will disarm them… quickly and perhaps violently.”

Hamas, which returned more bodies after Israel’s threat, will “play along” with the ceasefire, an expert on the group wrote in Foreign Affairs. But it “will fight tooth and nail to preserve its political and military standing in Gaza.”

US President Donald Trump said that his country’s $20 billion bailout for Argentina was contingent on Javier Milei’s party prevailing in midterm elections.

Buenos Aires is suffering a currency crisis; in a meeting in Washington, Trump reiterated Washington’s willingness to help, but added that “if he loses, we are not going to be generous.” Milei and Trump consider themselves political bedfellows, although they have very different approaches: The libertarian Milei has removed tariffs and import controls, while Trump has imposed new ones.

Trump often ties diplomacy up with politics, though not always successfully: His comments during Canada’s election hurt the Conservative Party’s prospects, and Brazil’s left-wing leader has seen a poll boost following Trump’s criticism of him.

The US carried out another strike on a vessel off the Venezuelan coast, killing six and ramping up tensions between Washington and Caracas.

The US military has stepped up attacks on what President Donald Trump said are “narcoterrorists.” Trump did not specify the nationality of the victims, but the Navy has deployed several warships to the Caribbean Sea and stepped up pressure on Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro: One analyst told El País that the attacks are not about drugs but “bringing about a change of regime — a deeply corrupt and criminal regime” as cheaply as possible.

Experts have questioned the legality of the strikes, saying that simply designating drug smugglers as narcoterrorists does not make them lawful targets.

US President Donald Trump is seeking further diplomatic wins on the back of his success brokering a truce between Israel and Hamas.

The ceasefire is a diplomatic coup for Trump, who promised long-term peace in the Middle East. Insiders told The New York Times that Trump pushed Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu towards a deal, while also pressuring Hamas.

The victory has buoyed Trump, who is looking for new foreign policy wins: On Friday he meets with Ukrainian President Volodymy Zelenskyy, who said the breakthrough offers “hope” to end the Ukraine war. Trump also offered an olive branch to Iran, suggested intervening in fighting between Afghanistan and Pakistan, and the US may facilitate a ceasefire between Thailand and Cambodia.

A Chinese effort to attract top foreign scientists has been met with a domestic backlash.

Beijing recently advertised its new visa for leading experts as a step towards establishing China as the world’s leading scientific power. The visa was also seen as a way to lure talent that would have otherwise gone to the US, where new laws have priced out many would-be migrants. But the visa sparked anger within China — where youth unemployment is high — with prominent influencers accusing the government of inviting foreigners to steal domestic jobs, The New York Times reported.

One analyst who praised the plan was accused of being a race traitor, and other critics have voiced fears that China will be overrun by outsiders.

US President Donald Trump hosted Argentine leader Javier Milei at the White House on Tuesday as Washington races to finalize a $20 billion bailout for Buenos Aires.

The rare, direct foreign intervention, which will take the form of a currency swap, is aimed at boosting a collapsing peso and calming market volatility ahead of Argentina’s midterm elections later this month. That contest will determine if Milei maintains a political mandate to further his aggressive cost-cutting agenda.

The bailout looms over this week’s IMF and World Bank meetings and shows how Trump has merged politics and economics in his approach to Latin America, the BBC wrote: While he helps an ideological ally in Argentina, neighboring Brazil is grappling with 50% US tariffs.

A surge in dealmaking and trading boosted the profits of the largest US banks, though some CEOs warned that investor excitement fuels the risk of a bubble.

Wall Street banks are getting “their party hats on,” the Financial Times wrote, as the AI boom has helped prop up the private sector despite looming concerns over the labor market and inflation. While executives like Citi CEO Jane Fraser cautioned about “pockets of valuation frothiness,” the banks credited a “resilient” economy for their strong earnings.

The global economy has indeed held up this year despite trade and geopolitical turbulence, the IMF said Tuesday, lifting its 2025 GDP growth forecast to 3.2%.

Maritime shipping emerged as the latest flashpoint in the US-China trade war.

Both Washington and Beijing on Tuesday began charging new tit-for-tat port fees on each other’s ships; the levies are part of a ballooning economic conflict between the countries that flared up last week, cooled slightly over the weekend, and ramped back up Tuesday. In a move that could further dent ties, China sanctioned five US subsidiaries of a South Korean shipbuilder, alleging they cooperated with Washington’s probe of the Chinese maritime industry.

Global commerce has been under strain this year as companies grapple with a flurry of on-again, off-again trade policies; the new port fees will likely make shipping rates more volatile, analysts said.

US President Donald Trump led a “peace summit” of world leaders on a whirlwind trip to the Middle East, hailing the end of the war in Gaza, but analysts said major sticking points could block lasting peace.

Trump flew to Israel and then Egypt to cement an end to a two-year conflict that saw upwards of 1,200 Israelis and 67,000 Palestinians die and upended the balance of power in the Middle East. Trump’s victory lap came as hostages held in Gaza and Palestinian prisoners in Israel returned home. Yet there is still a “big gap” between Israel and the Arab world on the pathway to a two-state solution, one analyst told The Washington Post.

The Gaza peace plan was a diplomatic coup for US President Donald Trump, analysts said, drawing praise from even his political foes.

World leaders were summoned to Egypt at short notice — “like 20 minutes” in some cases, according to Trump — to witness the signing of a document committing to supporting peace between Israelis and Palestinians. The event offered “a brutal lesson in realpolitik,” The Guardian said, with leaders jockeying to position themselves next to Trump.

Even former US President Joe Biden, who sharply criticized Trump during two election campaigns, casting him as a threat to democracy, commended him for pulling it off. It was “a stunning display of personal and presidential power,” NBC’s chief international correspondent wrote.

SpaceX’s Starship, the biggest and most powerful spacecraft ever launched, successfully completed its 11th test flight, bringing the company closer to sending humans to other worlds.

SpaceX CEO Elon Musk wants to take humans to the moon, and eventually Mars. NASA chose Starship to carry its crewed lander on its Artemis missions, which hope to put astronauts on the lunar surface in 2027.

Test flights seven, eight, and nine ended in “rapid unexpected disassembly,” but this and the last performed well, with the splashdown in the Indian Ocean so accurate that it landed within sight of a camera buoy which captured the ship’s last moments. This iteration of the rocket is the last before an even larger variant is built.

The US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent accused China of deliberately harming the global economy, as tensions between Beijing and Washington reignited again after an apparent reprieve.

The superpowers imposed punishing tariffs on one another earlier this year, only to lower them, and had for months been discussing a trade deal. The mood has soured recently, though, with each side imposing additional curbs; new US tariffs come into effect today.

US officials signaled openness to a trade deal yesterday, leading to a brief stock rally, but the diplomatic tone has toughened. Bessent told the Financial Times that Beijing wants to “pull everybody else down,” while China said: “If there’s a fight, we’ll fight… if there’s a talk, the door is open.”

Lead poisoning, all but eradicated in the West, still harms millions of children in the developing world, with lead-acid battery recycling a key culprit.

Car batteries contain about $15 worth of lead, a significant sum in the Global South. Informal salvage businesses buy old batteries and melt the lead in makeshift furnaces, releasing waste that ends up in the air, soil, and water.

An estimated one in three children worldwide — 800 million — have blood lead levels as high as those in Flint, Michigan’s 2014 water crisis. Lead is a neurotoxin that impairs brain development. Fixing the problem should be simple, Vox reported: Removing taxes on licensed, safer recyclers, allowing them to compete with unlicensed ones, would be a start.

US President Donald Trump urged Israel to seize the chance for peace and called on Palestinians to turn “forever from the path of terror” in a speech to the Israeli parliament Monday, hours after Hamas released all 20 living hostages.

Trump received a hero’s welcome by the Knesset — as well as being briefly heckled by a left-wing member, who was promptly escorted out — after brokering a ceasefire that raised hopes for lasting peace in the region.

“Generations from now, this will be remembered as the moment that everything began to change,” Trump told lawmakers, describing the truce as “the end of the age of terror and death.”

It came amid scenes of jubilation in Tel Aviv, where huge numbers gathered for public screenings of the hostages being released. Shortly after, bus-loads of Palestinian prisoners freed by Israel arrived in the occupied West Bank city of Ramallah, AFP reported.

Trump used his address to say it would be “great to get a peace deal” with Iran, Israel’s other major conflict, after the US aided the Jewish state in striking Tehran’s nuclear sites earlier this year.

Analysts are skeptical over whether the Gaza peace agreement — which calls for a full disarmament of Hamas, among other vexxing issues — will be fully implemented, even as its initial phase looked to be unfolding as hoped.

US stocks bounced back Monday on signs that Washington’s trade tensions with China were easing, coupled with deescalation in the Middle East.

Following Wall Street’s worst selloff since April on Friday, top US officials signaled openness to a trade deal with Beijing to resolve a fresh spat over rare earth exports. Optimism over a permanent peace in Gaza following a landmark ceasefire deal also buoyed global markets as traders reassessed the geopolitical risk premium that has dominated sentiment.

Wall Street is confident heading into earnings season, as the big banks begin reporting Tuesday: A rebound in dealmaking has boosted bank stocks, but thorny issues like AI spending and tariffs will loom over the corporate reports, Bloomberg wrote.

The Dutch government took control of a Chinese-owned chipmaker, a rare intervention that threatens to escalate tensions between Beijing and the West over access to critical technologies.

Citing national security concerns, the Netherlands said it was worried about Nexperia possibly transferring tech to its Chinese parent company, Wingtech, which in response accused the Dutch government of “geopolitical bias.” Wingtech is already on a US blacklist amid broader pressure aimed at curbing Beijing’s tech advances.

The Nexperia takeover, which sparked speculation about possible Chinese countermeasures aimed at Dutch firms, is an “escalation of an existing trend,” with governments pressuring companies to unravel assets deemed geopolitical risks, the Financial Times wrote.

The economics Nobel went to three researchers who showed how growth is driven by “creative destruction.”

Joel Mokyr, Philippe Aghion, and Peter Howitt demonstrated that innovation is what pushes economies forwards: New technologies and methods drive out old ones, sometimes destroying a sector of the economy — and some jobs — but improving the quality of our lives overall.

A classic example would be the growth of mechanized farming, which put millions of farmers out of work but led to a richer and better-fed world. Mokyr took half the award, for identifying the mechanism, while Aghion and Howitt shared the other half, for creating the mathematical model for how products enter the market and drive older ones out.

Chinese trade figures beat expectations, suggesting Beijing may be weathering pressure from Washington amid intensifying tariff threats from the White House.

The upbeat export and import data came despite trade with the US cratering, indicating Chinese firms are finding new markets for their goods.

The figures came after US President Donald Trump threatened an extra 100% duty on Chinese goods in response to Beijing tightening curbs on exports of rare earths, heightening tensions ahead of a potential meeting between Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping this month.

“Neither China nor the US wishes to return to mutually damaging tit-for-tat escalations and retaliations,” ING’s China chief economist wrote. “However, the past few weeks show that the possibility of miscalculation is always present.”

A coup is under way in Madagascar, the country’s presidency said. Madagascar has seen weeks of protests, initially spurred by shortages of water and power but now encompassing deeper unhappiness over corruption, inflation, and high unemployment.

Demonstrators have gathered in the capital Antananarivo, and there are reports of shooting between police and the army. The protests are led by a youth movement which uses symbols — including a pirate flag from popular Japanese manga One Piece, a stand-in for confronting oppression — associated with demonstrations in other countries, including Morocco, Nepal, and Peru. Yet Madagascar has its own history of upheaval: The army has led several coups since the country’s independence from France in 1960, most recently in 2009.

US President Donald Trump said he was considering sending long-range missiles to Ukraine for use against Russia, as part of what appears to be strengthening military cooperation between Washington and Kyiv.

Ties between the US and Ukraine frayed at the beginning of Trump’s term, illustrated by a heated Oval Office exchange between Trump and his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

But relations now look to be improving: Washington has for months been providing intelligence to Kyiv to mount aerial attacks on Russian energy facilities, the Financial Times said, and Trump told reporters on Sunday he may demand Russian President Vladimir Putin seriously commit to peace talks, or face the US transferring Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine.

Sébastien Lecornu, who resigned as French prime minister last Monday before being reappointed on Friday, named the first cabinet of his new tenure.

His previous attempt to appoint ministers prompted a broad parliamentary revolt and thus his resignation, making him the shortest-serving premier in France’s modern history. Four days later, President Emmanuel Macron reappointed him.

Macron has now had either seven or eight prime ministers in his presidency, including either four or five in 12 months, depending on whether you count Lecornu twice. The new cabinet, containing many of the same figures as the last one, faces the same challenges: A minority government, and convincing a hostile parliament to pass an unpopular but economically necessary budget.

The White House is considering invoking the Insurrection Act as officials ramp up federal law enforcement action in US cities, Vice President JD Vance said.

The 1807 statute would allow President Donald Trump to deploy active-duty military personnel; the government has already sent National Guard troops to Democratic-run cities with the stated aim of protecting immigration agents from protests.

Courts have blocked some of those deployments, but analysts say the legal setbacks could push Trump to take a more aggressive route and invoke the act.

Top Trump adviser Stephen Miller has called the unfavorable court rulings a “legal insurrection,” but polls show that most Americans oppose using active troops in US cities.

Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro called opposition leader María Corina Machado a “demonic witch” in his first comments since she won the Nobel Peace Prize.

Maduro is under pressure: The award has concentrated international attention on his regime, and the US military has repeatedly struck alleged Venezuelan vessels as part of its attacks on Caracas-backed drug-smuggling networks.

There is more US firepower in the Caribbean Sea than Washington committed to the Battle of Midway, Americas Quarterly reported. Maduro did not mention Machado by name, but said “90% of the population rejects the demonic witch.”

Deadly clashes erupted along Afghanistan’s border with Pakistan, marking a new low in the countries’ ties since the Taliban retook power in 2021.

The violence killed dozens of Pakistani soldiers and Taliban fighters and comes days after Islamabad bombed an Afghan market close to the border, alleging it held a terrorist base.

Pakistan has accused Afghanistan’s Taliban government of offering a safe haven to militants carrying out cross-border attacks.

The confrontations, while risking a broader conflict, also pose a geopolitical opportunity for India, which has cautiously sought to improve relations with the Taliban, perhaps filling the diplomatic hole left by its regional rival, Pakistan, analysts said.

China on Sunday vowed countermeasures against the US if President Donald Trump imposes a further 100% duty on Beijing, escalating the countries’ spat over rare earth minerals.

Trump made his latest tariff threat on Friday after China imposed new restrictions on rare earth exports.

Both sides are digging in: US Vice President JD Vance said settling the dispute will be a “delicate dance,” but Washington has “far more cards” than Beijing, which signaled it is “not afraid” of a trade war.

US stocks tumbled after Trump went on the offensive; a broader deterioration of ties could also imperil China’s recent market rally and cast fresh doubts over the country’s investability.

Green turtles, once on the brink of extinction, have bounced back, a new report found.

The species is one of the world’s largest sea turtles, and humans have long hunted it to make turtle soup and to eat its eggs as a delicacy; it has been listed as endangered by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature since the 1980s.

But conservation efforts, including protecting buried eggs and releasing hatchlings to avoid predators and accidental capture in fishing nets, have helped their numbers recover, although the population remains far below its pre-industrial peak.

Other animals have been less fortunate: Notably, more than half of all bird species were found to be “in decline.”

US President Donald Trump threatened a “massive increase” of tariffs on China on Friday, arguing it was necessary to “financially counter” new rare earth export controls that China has imposed on America.

Posting on Truth Social, Trump said that there was no way that China “should be allowed to hold the World “captive”″ over its export policies. He added that Beijing’s new policy meant that there was “no reason” to hold a planned meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in South Korea later this month.

The wind sector is particularly badly hit, with projections of a mere 1.8% in capacity growth in the current year, the lowest since 2010, largely due to policy headwinds by the Trump administration including the cancellation of hundreds of millions in offshore wind funding as well as freezing permitting for offshore wind projects. However, the transitory nature of the U.S. government is likely to keep clean energy innovation in the country alive and well.

China is the global leader in clean energy innovation, including in the manufacturing, large-scale deployment, investment, and the development of new technologies like fast-charging electric vehicles. The country's dominance in the supply chain for key clean energy technologies like solar panels, wind turbines, and batteries is significant, supported by decades of strategic planning and massive government and private investments. In April, Chinese scientists unveiled the world’s first operational thorium reactor. According to Guangming Daily, the 2-megawatt experimental reactor is located in the Gobi Desert, and the latest milestone puts China at the forefront in the race to build a practical thorium reactor–long considered a more abundant and safer alternative to uranium. More significantly, China relied heavily on long-abandoned American research in the field. In the 1960s, American scientists built and tested molten salt reactors, but Washington eventually shelved the program in favor of uranium-based technology. “The US left its research publicly available, waiting for the right successor. We were that successor,” project chief scientist Xu Hongjie said. “Rabbits sometimes make mistakes or grow lazy. That’s when the tortoise seizes its chance,” he added.

U.S. based companies and startups are still pursuing patents near historically high levels, including in the battery and electric vehicle sectors. These companies use these patents as tools or corporate assets to achieve various business objectives such as creation of barriers to entry, protection of competitive differentiators and protection of market share, among other important uses. The fact that the vast majority of cleantech innovations are now happening outside the United States makes it harder to find non-U.S. prior art especially for overbroad patent portfolios. Prior art documents are any publicly available information that existed before the filing date of a patent application, such as patents, publications, websites, and products, that can be used to determine if an invention is novel and non-obvious. Patent examiners use prior art to decide if an invention meets the criteria for being new and not an obvious modification of what already exists. Patents experts are increasingly advising their clients to prepare at least a part of their patent portfolio in a more narrow manner to lower the risk of future litigations airing from unconsidered prior art arising that can result in significant legal costs.

Recent patent cases involving U.S. energy companies include Tigo Energy's (NASDAQ:TYGO) settlement with SMA over solar technology and Maxeon Solar's (NASDAQ:MAXN) lawsuits against competitors like Canadian Solar (NASDAQ:CSIQ) and REC Solar for allegedly infringing on its TOPCon solar panel technology. Tigo Energy reached a multi-year settlement with SMA in May 2025 to end a patent infringement lawsuit concerning Tigo's rapid shutdown technology for solar systems. Tigo filed the lawsuit in July 2022, alleging that SMA infringed on several of its patents related to rapid shutdown features required by the U.S. National Electrical Code (NEC). The settlement concluded the legal dispute, though the specific terms remain confidential. Meanwhile, Maxeon Solar sued Canadian Solar in March 2024 for infringing on its patents for TOPCon solar cell technology, alleging that Canadian Solar's n-type solar panels with TOPCon cells violate its intellectual property. This lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas and is part of a broader effort by Maxeon to protect its patents against companies that make, import, or sell TOPCon products. Canadian Solar has indicated it will defend itself against the claims.

In July, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) rejected parts of PJM’s compliance filing for Order No.
Failure to consider them leads to projects paying unnecessarily high grid upgrade costs, projects dropping out of the queue, and customers paying unjust and unreasonable rates.","Congressman Don Beyer (D-VA) today led 21 U.S. Representatives representing districts within the PJM Interconnection service territory, the largest power grid operator in the United States, to demand that PJM take key steps to address skyrocketing energy bills for American households. The Members stressed that PJM must use current information and technologies, particularly on batteries and Alternative Transmission Technologies (ATTs), to fully comply with FERC Order 2023 and lower energy costs.

In a letter addressed to PJM Interconnection’s President and CEO they wrote:

“Dear Mr. Asthana:

As members of Congress serving constituents within the PJM Interconnection service territory, we have a significant interest in ensuring that PJM is providing affordable electricity to its customers. There have been stark increases in electricity rates for our constituents. Some of our districts are facing electricity rate increases above 20 percent, and these unacceptably higher bills are coming when many households are already struggling to keep up with a higher cost of living. These rate increases are unaffordable and necessitate that PJM respond effectively to pursue reforms to the interconnection process that would address and prevent current and future rate hikes.

In the face of rising electricity demand, including from data centers, electrification, and increased manufacturing, it is paramount that PJM work to connect and approve new power generation projects expeditiously. Despite the predictable rise in demand, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory found PJM’s interconnection queue to be amongst the most backlogged in the country, even after PJM froze the queue from accepting new applicants for several years. The average project in the queue is waiting several years for an interconnection agreement. Additionally, when projects do get through the backlogged queue, they are assessed with sky-high network upgrade costs. Because PJM has neglected to proactively support planning or building sufficient new transmission lines, each project in the queue is paying high costs for new transmission lines.

Given that more rapid interconnection could have saved our constituents from these price shocks, we feel it imperative to urge PJM to address the interconnection issue with urgency, beyond the initial reforms already undertaken. In July, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) rejected parts of PJM’s compliance filing for Order No. 2023, Improvements to Generator Interconnection Procedures and Agreements. In particular, FERC found PJM’s filing inadequate regarding: charging assumptions and high grid upgrade costs for battery storage projects and consideration of Alternative Transmission Technologies (ATTs). We agree with FERC’s finding and the need to address these compliance gaps as past reforms and practices are insufficient and request that PJM fully address each of these shortfalls in its refiling, due October 22 of this year.

It's concerning that when battery storage projects are a low-cost technology and quick way to add capacity to the existing grid, PJM insists on relying upon on outdated and conservative charging assumptions to unfairly make battery projects uneconomic, contributing to the low penetration of this key technology compared to other regions that have deployed nearly 50 times more capacity and where batteries are helping maintain reliability. In its order, FERC found that PJM’s Order 2023 compliance proposal on operating assumptions for energy storage resources represented “an impermissible collateral attack on the final rule.” In this era of rising prices, PJM must cease its attacks on FERC’s final rule, acknowledge its requirements, and ensure that its updated compliance proposal later this month fully accounts for FERC’s orders on energy storage assumptions.

PJM must also consider all enumerated ATTs for all projects and report transparently on their evaluation. ATTs can provide substantial benefits due to their quicker deployment and lower costs compared to traditional network upgrades. Failure to consider them leads to projects paying unnecessarily high grid upgrade costs, projects dropping out of the queue, and customers paying unjust and unreasonable rates. This failure has contributed to the capacity auction shortfalls and higher prices we are seeing today. While we appreciate that PJM’s newly-developed Technical Reference Guide pushes the consideration of ATT’s, a requirement for them to be considered must be codified within PJM’s tariff.

We fully expect PJM to comply with FERC’s direction on these topics, and urge PJM to make haste in achieving the 1-2 year interconnection study timelines it promises in its compliance filing. Our constituents and their pocketbooks are counting on it.

Beyond FERC Order No. 2023, we urge PJM to pursue deeper interconnection reforms to bring much-needed capacity online quickly and to achieve these interconnection study timelines. Other grid operators have seen great results come from so-called “connect and manage” techniques, and PJM should work to make its energy-only interconnection pathway, the Energy Resource Interconnection Service, easier to use and faster than alternatives. The reality is that the grid – and our constituents – need power as soon as possible, and PJM should be pursuing every available opportunity to hook clean power up to the grid.

While PJM’s announced partnership with Tapestry to consider study automation was a step in the right direction, PJM lags behind other regions in pursuing these vital software solutions. We are concerned that automation efforts won’t deliver faster study timelines for years to come, and we ask you to accelerate these efforts and implement automation solutions within the next year.

We are further concerned by your efforts to prioritize some resource types over others, namely natural gas plants. After promising that the Reliability Resource Initiative (RRI) was a “one-time” queue jumping mechanism, PJM proposed a new “Expedited Interconnection Track” within the large load Critical Issue Fast Path. This new track would once again come before the first cycle of its regular queue is opened. This contradicts testimony that Mr. Asim Haque, PJM’s Senior Vice President for Governmental and Member Services, gave at an Energy and Commerce Committee hearing in March of this year, when he confirmed that the RRI intervention was a one-time solution, and that PJM was working to create an interconnection process that did not need manual interventions. Any proposal to again authorize queue interventions would be in immediate legal jeopardy and would waste time that PJM and our constituents do not have.

We fear that a focus on new queue-jumping fast tracks for certain resource types or projects serving certain customers betrays a lack of seriousness in fixing the regular-order queue. We urge PJM to focus instead on speeding interconnection studies for the hundreds of projects, primarily low-cost clean energy and storage, that have been lingering in PJM’s queue for years—and to open the queue to new applicants as soon as possible.

If PJM is serious about fixing the cost crisis it has had a role in shaping — the organization must take responsibility for the parts of the project development process it does control and fully address each of the above matters in its revised Order No. 2023 compliance filing while making deeper reforms to speed interconnection. Anything else would be a dereliction of PJM’s duty to provide electricity to our constituents at just and reasonable rates.”

The letter also notes forecasts of rising costs for electric power that the energy policy think tank Energy Innovation attributes to the tax and spending cut megabill that President Donald Trump signed July 4.
“Terminating these funding awards at a time of record-high energy demand and rising costs would be counterintuitive, reckless and ill-advised,” Evers concludes in his letter to Wright.","With more than $1.5 billion in federal energy investments in Wisconsin at risk, Gov. Tony Evers is urging the Trump administration not to roll back previously awarded funds in the face of rising energy costs.

Evers’ response, in a letter to U.S. Department of Energy Secretary Chris Wright, followed multiple news reports in the last week about energy projects on target lists for cancellation.

The governor’s office has compiled a list of 22 projects for which federal Energy Department funding totaling $1.56 billion has been marked for cancellation.

“Federal support plays a critical role in advancing the Wisconsin Idea and American innovation, lowering energy bills for families across America, supporting clean energy development to improve energy independence and resilience, creating good-paying jobs in innovative industries and sectors, and maintaining our nation’s leadership in science and technology,” Evers wrote Tuesday in his letter to Wright.

“Given these clear benefits and the importance of these investments to Wisconsin’s and our nation’s economy, I was deeply concerned to see reporting last week containing a list of over 600 DOE funding awards that are potentially going to be targeted for termination with no clear reasoning or justification.”

Evers’ letter mentions several Wisconsin projects and companies on the target list, including several that the Wisconsin Examiner reported on this week.

The letter also notes forecasts of rising costs for electric power that the energy policy think tank Energy Innovation attributes to the tax and spending cut megabill that President Donald Trump signed July 4.

“Terminating these funding awards at a time of record-high energy demand and rising costs would be counterintuitive, reckless and ill-advised,” Evers concludes in his letter to Wright. “I urge you to reaffirm DOE’s commitment to honoring these funding awards and to continue supporting these investments that drive Wisconsin’s and the nation’s energy landscape forward.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-99/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/pxl_20250304_191115239-1024x5761760566605.jpg?h=c12e0b96&itok=fVK-U7RP,N,,2025-10-15 21:05:50.006985

The lapsed federal tax credits meant significant savings to consumers, as reported by EnergySage.
EV chargers are available at grocery stores, park and ride lots, and gas stations.
Shared EV chargers can also be found at apartment complexes, workplaces, doctors’ offices, sports facilities, and other parking areas with restricted access.
The statewide network of public and shared private EV chargers is in addition to the estimated 800,000 EV chargers installed in single-family homes, according to the governor's office.","More Californians are ditching the gas pump and going electric, with zero-emission vehicles making up more than 29% of new car sales in the three months ending in September—a record high.

California motorists purchased 124,755 zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs) in Q3 2025, a spike of nearly 30% over the previous quarter, according to the Governor's Office. The previous high of 26.9% of total car sales was set in Q3 2023.

This comes after last month's announcement that clean truck sales rose in California in 2024, with manufacturers reporting nearly 1 in 4 trucks, buses, and vans sold were zero-emission.

Californians have purchased 2,468,158 new ZEVs, surpassing the state's goal of 1.5 million ZEVs on California roads by 2025.

""This is unprecedented, we’re nearing a third of all new vehicles sold in the fourth largest economy on the planet being clean cars. We’re setting new records because this state believes in innovation, not isolation,"" said Gov. Gavin Newsom in a statement. ""While Trump sells out American innovation to China, California will keep charging ahead on our path to a future of cleaner air.”

Federal tax credits cut in 'Big Beautiful Bill'

The recent surge in ZEV purchases is attributed to the Sept. 30 expiration of the federal tax credit, which offered up to $7,500 for new EVs and $4,000 for used models.

Originally set to expire in 2032 as part of the Inflation Reduction Act, the Biden-era incentives were eliminated in HR 1 - ""The Big Beautiful Bill,"" signed by President Trump in July.

The lapsed federal tax credits meant significant savings to consumers, as reported by EnergySage. A $7,500 credit represented a 13% discount towards the $57,245 average cost of a new electric vehicle in August, according to Kelly Blue Book.

""Despite the efforts by the Trump administration to derail the ZEV industry and raise the cost of a clean car, Californians made it clear they want to drive ZEVs as they scooped up the remaining federal tax credits that expired at the end of last month,"" the California governor's statement continued.

Are there any EV tax credits still available?

While no federal tax credits exist and the popular California Clean Vehicle Rebate Project expired in 2023, grants and rebates are available for low-income Californians to purchase ZEVs, with information available at ClimateAction.ca.gov or ElectricForAll.org.

Californians may also find EV purchase incentives depending on where they live.

Generally offered by utility providers, the rebates vary in amount and scope. For example, Los Angeles Department of Water and Power customers can get rebates up to $4,000 on used electric or plug-in hybrid vehicles.

The San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District's Drive Clean in the San Joaquin Rebate Program provides rebates up to $3,000 to Valley residents and businesses to purchase or lease new, clean-air vehicles.

Rebates are not always guaranteed, can change, or programs can run out of funds, so a good rule of thumb is to regularly check your local utility or district for the most up-to-date information.

Where to find reliable EV chargers

If you are about to buy an EV or are one of the millions of Californians who already own one, finding a reliable charging station will be at your mind.

In California, there are now over 200,000 publicly accessible EV charging stations, announced the state last month.

Their state is also about to get a whole lot more.

The California Energy Commission also recently approved two National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Program projects to build 64 fast EV chargers along key highway corridors.

The commission also approved three grants totaling more than $10 million that will build out more than 1,000 Level 2 EV charging ports, the vast majority in low-income, disadvantaged, or affordable multifamily housing complexes throughout the state.

EV chargers are available at grocery stores, park and ride lots, and gas stations.

Shared EV chargers can also be found at apartment complexes, workplaces, doctors’ offices, sports facilities, and other parking areas with restricted access.

The statewide network of public and shared private EV chargers is in addition to the estimated 800,000 EV chargers installed in single-family homes, according to the governor's office.","https://www.desertsun.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/10/02/PFTC/86477685007-usatsi-26499302.jpg?crop=5711,3213,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-10-15 19:07:24.350364

Evers calls on Trump's energy department to preserve $1.5B in funding - WPR,"joe.schulz, Joe Schulz",,,,,https://www.wpr.org/news/evers-trump-energy-department-preserve-funding,"Tony Evers is calling on the Trump administration to preserve more than $1.5 billion in federal energy grants allocated in Wisconsin.
The U.S. Department of Energy is reportedly considering terminating more than 600 Biden-era funding awards across the country that total almost $24 billion.
Evers sent a letter to U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright on Tuesday, urging the administration to reconsider any plans to halt Department of Energy funding previously allocated to projects and organizations in the state.
“Terminating these funding awards at a time of record-high energy demand and rising costs would be counterintuitive, reckless, and ill-advised,” Evers wrote.
A new report from clean energy groups found about 75,000 Wisconsinites work in renewable energy, energy efficiency, electric vehicle manufacturing and other related fields.","Gov. Tony Evers is calling on the Trump administration to preserve more than $1.5 billion in federal energy grants allocated in Wisconsin.

The U.S. Department of Energy is reportedly considering terminating more than 600 Biden-era funding awards across the country that total almost $24 billion. That’s up from the agency’s announcement earlier this month that it would terminate 321 financial awards totaling about $7.5 billion in funding.

Among the more than 600 potential terminations are 22 awards to Wisconsin companies, organizations and projects that collectively could face more than $1.5 billion in lost funding, according to the governor’s office and a document obtained by business publication Latitude Media.

Evers sent a letter to U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright on Tuesday, urging the administration to reconsider any plans to halt Department of Energy funding previously allocated to projects and organizations in the state.

“Terminating these funding awards at a time of record-high energy demand and rising costs would be counterintuitive, reckless, and ill-advised,” Evers wrote. “I urge you to reaffirm DOE’s commitment to honoring these funding awards and to continue supporting these investments that drive Wisconsin’s and the nation’s energy landscape forward.”

The U.S. Department of Energy did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Evers’ letter. In a press release announcing the initial funding termination, Wright said the agency was reviewing billions of dollars in awards “rushed through in the final months of the Biden administration.”

“Rest assured, the Energy Department will continue reviewing awards to ensure that every dollar works for the American people,” Wright said in a statement.

At least two of the organizations identified by the governor’s office as being in danger of losing funding say they haven’t been notified of any changes to their awards.

Madison-based Alliant Energy could lose $80.7 million, according to the document. That’s broken into two awards of $50 million and $30.7 million. The up to $50 million would help bring smart grid technology to rural and underserved communities, while the $30.7 million would support a state-of-the-art energy storage system in Columbia County.

In a statement, Alliant Energy spokesperson Cindy Tomlinson said the utility is aware that the Trump administration and the Department of Energy are “working through their budgets and have notified some businesses of changes to grant announcements.”

“At this time, we have not been made aware of any changes to the announced DOE grants for our Alliant Energy projects,” Tomlinson said. “We are optimistic the value and viability of these projects is clear and that they will remain fully funded. These projects deliver economic and customer benefits.”

La Crosse-based Dairyland Power Cooperative could lose $28 million, according to the document. That money would support the development of three battery storage facilities in Dairyland’s rural service area.

Dairyland spokesperson Katie Thomson said in a statement that the cooperative “has not received any communication from the U.S. Department of Energy regarding a change in project status.”

“We remain committed to serving our members and supporting the region with safe, reliable, innovative and cost-competitive electricity,” Thomson said.

Of the awards identified in Wisconsin, the largest potential funding loss would be $925 million for the Heartland Hydrogen Hub, according to the governor’s office. The Heartland Hydrogen Hub is a regional partnership to produce low-carbon hydrogen and create energy and agriculture jobs in six states, including Wisconsin.

The Heartland Hydrogen Hub did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Other Wisconsin entities that could lose out on funding include Harley-Davidson, Johnson Controls, Generac Power Systems, Kohler Co., the Universities of Wisconsin and the city of Kaukauna, according to the document and the governor’s office. Those entities either declined to comment or did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Department of Energy awards to those entities included $89 million awarded to Harley to support electric motorcycle manufacturing in Pennsylvania and $33 million to Johnson Controls to support domestic heat pump manufacturing, according to press announcements matching dollar amounts from the governor’s office.

Amy Barrilleaux, a spokesperson for the nonprofit Clean Wisconsin, said the reports reflect the “uncertainty and chaos coming from the Trump administration.” She said it’s another sign of the administration’s preference toward fossil fuels.

“These investments were about looking forward,” she said. “They’re about energy efficiency, about making sure our grid is ready for the demands of climate change and other issues that we’re experiencing right now.”

Alex Beld, a spokesperson for the nonprofit RENEW Wisconsin, said federal funding cuts could slow job growth in the clean energy sector.

A new report from clean energy groups found about 75,000 Wisconsinites work in renewable energy, energy efficiency, electric vehicle manufacturing and other related fields.

“Jobs in that industry are growing at a rate of about four-and-a-half times of the rest of the economy, so we’d be putting that growth at risk,” Beld said.",https://www.wpr.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AP25175619817069-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-15 19:06:57.225692

The move follows the cancellation of a key federal initiative promoting EV purchases, which is expected to cause a steep drop in demand.

Breakdown of GM’s $1.6 billion hit

GM’s charges include “non-cash impairment and other charges of $1.2 billion as a result of adjustments to our EV capacity,” the automaker said in a public filing on Tuesday. The remaining $400 million will have a cash impact, mainly related to contract cancellation fees and commercial settlements tied to EV investments, the company explained.

Early EV gamble fails to pay off

The Detroit-based manufacturer was one of the first in the United States to make a major commitment to electric vehicles, a decision that hasn’t delivered the expected returns. GM currently produces the widest range of EV models in the country and holds a 13.8% market share, second only to Tesla’s 43.1%.

However, the overall market is considerably smaller than anticipated just a few years ago. In October 2021, GM announced plans to spend $35 billion on EV and autonomous vehicle development by 2025, a plan that was scaled back.

Impact of policy changes and slowing demand

In Tuesday’s filing, GM acknowledged it now expects “adoption rates of EVs to slow,” largely due to the Trump administration scrapping the $7,500 tax credit for EV buyers that had been introduced under President Biden.

“The charge doesn’t come as a surprise given recent market developments and the fact GM had made probably the most aggressive EV push of any traditional automaker,” Garrett Nelson, a senior equity analyst at CFRA Research, told Reuters.

Industrywide struggles with EV strategy

Ford Motor, one of GM’s main competitors, has also announced a $1.9 billion charge tied to its EV business. Industry insiders warn that more bad news could follow for automakers navigating the volatile electric market.

“I think we’re going to see multibillion-dollar write-downs flooding the headlines for the next few years,” Bank of America analyst John Murphy said in June.

Another financial blow after tariff impact

The $1.6 billion charge follows a $1.1 billion hit GM took in the second quarter of 2025, primarily due to tariffs imposed by President Trump.

Shaping the future of AI

Larry Fink, chairman and CEO of BlackRock and the chairman of AIP, said the consortium is “positioned to meet the growing demand for the infrastructure required as AI continues to reshape the global economy.”

“This partnership is bringing together leading companies and mobilizing private capital to accelerate AI innovation and drive global economic growth and productivity,” Fink added in a statement. “With this investment in Aligned Data Centers, we further our goal of delivering the infrastructure necessary to power the future of AI, while offering our clients attractive opportunities to participate in its growth,” said in a statement.

Aligned has 50 data center campuses across the U.S. and Latin America

AIP said that in less than a decade, Aligned has evolved into one of the largest and fastest growing data center companies in the world. It designs, builds, and operates cutting-edge data campuses and data centers for the world’s premier hyperscalers, neocloud, and enterprise innovators.

Aligned’s portfolio includes 50 campuses and more than 5 gigawatts of operational and planned capacity, including assets under development, primarily located in key Tier I digital gateway regions across the U.S. and Latin America, including Dallas, Northern Virginia, Chicago, Ohio, Phoenix, Salt Lake City, Sao Paulo (Brazil), Queretaro (Mexico), and Santiago (Chile).

AIP said that Aligned’s rapid expansion has been fueled by strong execution and operating capabilities under the leadership of Aligned’s experienced management team.

Aligned’s Gigascale, Build-to-Scale, and Multi-Tenant Enterprise solutions leverage patented and patent-pending air, liquid, and hybrid cooling systems to deliver maximum adaptability and support evolving high-density AI workloads, even in energy-constrained regions, AIP said. Also, Aligned’s robust supply chain, strong partnerships, strategic land acquisitions, and energy enablement are driving efficiency and reliability.

According to AIP, Aligned also benefits from access to multiple sources of capital, providing financial flexibility for future growth.

View from investors

The Consortium brings deep expertise and capabilities across AI and digital infrastructure and includes AIP’s strategic partnership group and ability to form capital at scale, MGX’s leading global investment focus on AI and advanced technologies, and GIP’s long track record as a leading infrastructure investor with experience owning and operating some of the world’s most complex infrastructure assets.

The investment will equip Aligned with the capital and strategic support needed to accelerate growth and meet the rising demand for scalable, sustainable digital infrastructure. With backing from the Consortium, Aligned said it will accelerate the expansion of its footprint, drive further innovation, and continue delivering next-generation data center solutions.

“We are entering a new era in which AI will fundamentally reengineer our economies and enable accelerated growth. Compute infrastructure at scale will be foundational to that progress. Our investment in Aligned Data Centers will direct scalable capital to an operator built for efficiency and growth, with the mission to deliver the infrastructure needed to support global AI adoption.” Ahmed Yahia Al Idrissi, managing director and CEO of MGX and vice chairman of AIP, said.

Bayo Ogunlesi, chairman and CEO of Global Infrastructure Partners, a part of BlackRock, said the deal will have lasting impact.

“AI is reshaping every sector of the global economy,” Ogunlesi said. “By combining Aligned’s scalable, adaptable platform with AIP’s capital and capabilities, we will build the infrastructure to support innovation at scale—creating resilient, sustainable communities and unlocking transformative growth worldwide.”

Follows February announcement of new Aligned data center in Mansfield

In February, Dallas Innovates wrote about Aligned’s plans to open announced it will open a new data center in Mansfield to help meet demand for AI, cloud, and enterprise applications.

The campus, Aligned’s DFW-03, will be on a 27-acre site at 3801 Britton Road near State Highway 360 in the eastern part of Mansfield. The new data center marks an expansion of the company’s presence in Dallas-Fort Worth, the company said.

Tony Evers is urging the Trump administration not to roll back previously awarded funds in the face of rising energy costs.

Evers’ response, in a letter to U.S. Department of Energy Secretary Chris Wright, followed multiple news reports in the last week about energy projects on target lists for cancellation.

The governor’s office has compiled a list of 22 projects for which federal Energy Department funding totaling $1.56 billion has been marked for cancellation.

“Federal support plays a critical role in advancing the Wisconsin Idea and American innovation, lowering energy bills for families across America, supporting clean energy development to improve energy independence and resilience, creating good-paying jobs in innovative industries and sectors, and maintaining our nation’s leadership in science and technology,” Evers wrote Tuesday in his letter to Wright.

“Given these clear benefits and the importance of these investments to Wisconsin’s and our nation’s economy, I was deeply concerned to see reporting last week containing a list of over 600 DOE funding awards that are potentially going to be targeted for termination with no clear reasoning or justification.”

Evers’ letter mentions several Wisconsin projects and companies on the target list, including several that the Wisconsin Examiner reported on this week.

The letter also notes forecasts of rising costs for electric power that the energy policy think tank Energy Innovation attributes to the tax and spending cut megabill that President Donald Trump signed July 4.

“Terminating these funding awards at a time of record-high energy demand and rising costs would be counterintuitive, reckless and ill-advised,” Evers concludes in his letter to Wright. “I urge you to reaffirm DOE’s commitment to honoring these funding awards and to continue supporting these investments that drive Wisconsin’s and the nation’s energy landscape forward.”",https://wisconsinexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/PXL_20250304_191115239-2048x1152.jpg,N,,2025-10-15 19:06:42.714984

Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a critical part of maintaining and growing the manufacturing industry in our state.","BATON ROUGE, La. (Louisiana First) — Gov. Jeff Landry declared a moratorium on new carbon capture injection wells applications in Louisiana on Wednesday.

The Louisiana Department of Conservation and Energy is ordered to reevaluate the status of Class VI permit applications over the next 45 days. Landry explained that the order is to give residents and local officials a “clear roadmap” to ensure that applications for proposed projects follow state rules for carbon injection and carbon dioxide pipelines.

Landry said it is necessary that the department can take a methodical approach to application review and permitting, with safety for people and the environment in mind.

Industry groups release statements

Statement from the Louisiana Association of Business and Industry.

“Louisiana’s energy sector is the envy of the nation and the world. The expertise and talent of our workforce, combined with the state’s abundant natural resources, make the state a global destination for energy investment and innovation. LABI’s commitment to ensuring that Louisiana remains a top destination for investment, technological advancement and job creation is ironclad.

“While this appears to be a shared goal of the Landry administration, today’s executive

order on carbon capture and sequestration sends the wrong message. The order risks

ceding Louisiana’s competitive advantage to neighboring states eager to move forward with CCS investments.

“Carbon capture and sequestration is a key piece to growing and retaining the high-wage energy, industrial and manufacturing jobs that sustain Louisiana families, while also ensuring the long-term viability of our state’s oil, gas and petrochemical industries.

“Louisiana has already secured billions of dollars in CCS-related investments from

companies committed to delivering products and energy safely and efficiently with a lower carbon footprint. These projects generate millions in local tax revenue, supporting infrastructure improvements, school upgrades and economic development in communities.

“The momentum Louisiana has built is no accident. It is the direct result of securing state primacy and leveraging our unique geology, world-class energy infrastructure and highly skilled workforce. Together, these advantages have positioned Louisiana as a global leader in the energy marketplace. By injecting uncertainty and regulatory hurdles into this process, we stand to undo all the progress that state leaders have touted for months.

“We cannot yield our position to states like Texas that stand ready to capture these same opportunities. CCS represents a chance to strengthen Louisiana’s energy sector and make us the energy giant of the future we know we can be.

“LABI stands ready to work with the Landry administration and President Trump to ensure Louisiana secures our energy future, creating good-paying jobs and thriving local communities for generations to come. This shared vision can only be realized by building on our existing resources and embracing innovative technologies like carbon capture and sequestration, sending a clear message: Louisiana is open for business.”

Statement from the Louisiana Chemical Association.

“The Louisiana Chemical Association appreciates Governor Landry’s focus on public safety, environmental stewardship, and economic growth. We share his commitment to responsible industrial development and community engagement, and we value the Administration’s broader efforts to establish Louisiana as a premier place for business investments. To that end, our industry has already committed over $60 billion to projects that depend on carbon capture and storage.

That is why we are concerned that a conditional moratorium on new Class VI permit applications, as announced today, sends the wrong message to the market at a pivotal moment for Louisiana’s economy. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a critical part of maintaining and growing the manufacturing industry in our state. A pause on applications, regardless of the reasoning, signals uncertainty for projects that enable lower-emissions production, support thousands of high-wage jobs, and encourage future reinvestment.

Louisiana earned federal approval to run its own Class VI program so that permitting could be rigorous, predictable, and efficient here at home. That hard-won primacy, and the state’s recent issuance of its first Class VI permit, demonstrate that Louisiana can safely develop these projects in a way that protects communities and natural resources while continuing to encourage industrial investment in the state. A moratorium undermines that predictability at the very time companies are making multi-billion-dollar, multi-decade siting decisions.

LCA remains committed to working with the Governor, state agencies, and local officials to address concerns and deliver the environmental and economic benefits made possible by CCS projects in the state. Louisiana should proudly lead the nation in safe, responsible industrial decarbonization rather than signaling hesitation that allows other states to seize this opportunity.”

Statement from the Louisiana Oil and Gas Association.

“We respectfully disagree with the Governor‘s decision to halt the review of any new CCUS applications.

“We are thankful that the Governor didn’t cancel existing CCUS projects, which will continue to prove how safe this technology actually is, and we encourage industry to continue moving forward with the hope that the Governor will lift this moratorium sooner rather than later.

“For 75+ years Louisiana’s regulatory arm has safely authorized and governed injection wells. AND for 40+ years through Enhanced Oil Recovery, the Department has safely regulated the injection of CO2. In fact, since 2010, over 47 billion metric tons of CO2 have been safely injected and ultimately stored in Louisiana formations.

“Carbon capture is a proven tool that will bring significant economic development and new opportunities to our state and our country, and we remain committed to advancing these benefits for Louisiana.”

Statement from American Petroleum Institute Gulf Coast Region Director Gifford Briggs.

“We share the governor’s goal of addressing the backlog of CCS project applications, but an indefinite moratorium undermines Louisiana’s energy leadership and sets a precedent that could discourage development and innovation across the Gulf Coast and the nation. This executive order creates uncertainty that could delay projects, and send jobs and opportunities elsewhere. Now, Louisiana’s leadership role in American energy security is in jeopardy.”

The agency has begun so-called reductions in force in the offices of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Clean Energy Demonstrations, State and Community Energy Programs, and Minority Economic Impact.","A green bubble might be about to pop, as clean energy companies struggle to stay afloat under President Donald Trump.

Residential solar installer Sunnova, the solar lender Solar Mosaic and the panel maker Meyer Burger have all filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection this year. Now, utility-scale solar developer Pine Gate Renewables, based in Asheville, North Carolina, plans to file for bankruptcy protection in early November, according to a person with knowledge of its business plans.

The financial woes mark the likely end of a green investment boom that emerged under former President Joe Biden, who signed generous tax credits for renewable development, but has become increasingly strained in recent years as interest rates rose and supply chains labored to keep up. Trump has piled on more pressure, phasing out Biden’s tax credits, trashing permits for planned developments and imposing tariffs on a wide range of imported components.

“You had the look of a bubble in 2019-2020 when everyone and their mother was a renewable energy developer,” said Patrick Worrall, the chief financial officer of New Columbia Solar and a longtime industry observer. The industry, he said, is now “in the process of seeing the beginning part of a depression.”

Pine Gate increasingly looks like a cautionary tale. Founded in 2016, it claims to have secured more than $7 billion in project financing and capital investment. It has more than 100 solar facilities operating across the country with a combined 2 gigawatts of capacity.

It was already under financial duress before Trump took office. Pine Gate executives were racing to raise money to stave off a cash crunch last year, and the company has been forced to pay for construction mistakes made by its subsidiary, Blue Ridge Power. The company notified North Carolina regulators last month it was planning to lay off more than 500 people at Blue Ridge Power, according to PV Magazine. A Pine Gate spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment.

Bloomberg was the first to report that the company was pondering a bankruptcy filing.

‘The climate imperative’

Demand for electricity is growing, and analysts say the long lead times needed to build traditional power plants that run on natural gas or nuclear energy mean wind, solar and batteries still have a place in the U.S. power mix. In the short term, business is booming as developers rush to get projects into construction before the clean energy tax credits disappear in July.

The outlook for the industry darkens after 2026. Several analysts said they expect a wave of consolidation and bankruptcies, as companies struggle to navigate the combination of tariffs, the loss of tax credits and lenders’ increasing hesitance to invest in early stage renewable projects.

Large investors including Generate Capital, the green investment fund that holds a stake in Pine Gate, are shifting their strategy by investing in projects rather than development companies. A Generate Capital spokesperson declined to comment, but the fund’s thinking was outlined in a recent blog post by CEO David Crane.

The industry needs to be “honest about our mistakes,” Crane wrote, arguing that the sector’s growth and climate aspirations clouded its business judgment.

“Our priority today is to invest in sound projects, sponsored and implemented by well-run companies focused on the fundamentals,” said Crane, a former utility executive who served in the Biden administration. “This is where the climate imperative rests right now.”

DOE blames Biden for staff cuts

The Department of Energy has accused at least six of its own offices of “wasteful spending” and told staffers they may be reassigned, fired or transferred, write Hannah Northey and Carlos Anchondo.

The agency has begun so-called reductions in force in the offices of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Clean Energy Demonstrations, State and Community Energy Programs, and Minority Economic Impact. EERE contains three offices that focus on solar, wind and hydrogen.

“All these offices played a major role in the Biden administration’s war on American Energy,” said DOE spokesperson Ben Dietderich. The moves come after Trump on Tuesday said he would soon cut “Democrat programs” and warned “they’re never going to come back in many cases.”

Other emergency managers say they fear that could scare away immigrants and Hispanic citizens from seeking help after a natural disaster. “A detention center for immigrants is not something emergency managers should build,” said Sarah Miller, who formerly coordinated emergency management for 16 cities near Seattle.

It’s an unusual arrangement: The other four detention centers created by the Trump administration for immigration-related arrests operate at prisons or are run by the state departments of correction. But Florida emergency manager Kevin Guthrie has played a central role in the construction and operation of Alligator Alcatraz.

Florida DEM spokesperson Stephanie Hartman said of the criticism, “illegal immigration is a national emergency.”

Cut red tape and oppose Trump, Danish minister says

The Danish foreign minister believes the EU can deregulate without bowing to Trump, writes Camille Gijs.

Brussels has been torching swaths of environmental red tape for over a year, as it tries to restore industry competitiveness with U.S. and Chinese rivals. Next week, EU leaders are expected to urge the bloc’s executive to speed up the efforts, which now span the defense, environmental and digital sectors.

Danish Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen said the move is vital to keeping Europe globally competitive.

“If our investors are met with the red carpet in the U.S. and by red tape in Europe, they will, at the end of the day, choose the U.S.,” he stressed.

What their engineers found are two completely different approaches to cooling.

One prioritizes simplicity, while the other squeezes out efficiency using some surprising engineering.

Cooling an electric motor seems like a science that we've had down for years. Just throw some liquid antifreeze through some tubes, make sure air is blowing through a sufficiently sized radiator and everything is fine. But there's a fine science that goes into making sure each component is cooled to just the right amount and in the right places.

Recently, Sandy Munro's engineering firm, Munro & Associates, decided to tear down two electric traction motors. One is from a Tesla Cybertruck and the other is from a Chevrolet Equinox—meaning that we're getting a taste of Silicon Valley's latest and greatest, as well as Detroit's take on making an affordable electric powertrain. The differences show that the automakers have wildly different strategies for cooling their drive motors.

The technical explainer of the two motors is given by Munro's Paul Turnbull. He shows off the internals of both motors, as well as the various parts needed to cool them, and notes the trade-offs between the two platforms.

Let's start with GM's approach to cooling the motor. Turnbull explains that GM's brilliance is in the simplicity of how it achieves cooling—rather than use complex plumbing and pumps, GM uses the motor itself as kind of an ingenious gear system to fling oil upwards into cast channels that then use gravity to rain down over the motor. This cools the windings, magnets, and cast metal all at once.

This method is cheap to engineer and simple because there are fewer moving parts to fail. It also doesn't require sapping additional power from the car's battery to run any external cooling hardware (more on this in a moment with Tesla's approach). It's also an old trick that Toyota used more than a decade ago in the Prius C.

But this clever setup has limits. It's dependent on the motor speed, basically self-throttling oil when you're flying down the highway but not so much when the motor is stationary in traffic. And if you're on a steep hill or thrashing around a track, the system's ""rainfall"" method of cooling can shift off target, which might not be ideal for an electric motor that can spin at speed of around 10,000 RPM.

Tesla, on the other hand, uses a more precise method of cooling. It uses a high-pressure pump to force oil into channels where it flows over specific components like the electrical windings and magnets to keep them nice and cool. This approach to cooling is also why Tesla can use cheaper neodymium magnets in its powertrains rather than rare earth metals.

By not over-cooling the motor itself (but rather precisely applying the oil to the points where temperature matters the most), Tesla's approach means that the motor's casing stays at a higher temperature despite its cooler internals. This increases the electrical resistance of the case and reduces the formation of eddy currents.

Eddy currents, for those who don't know, are basically tiny whirlpools of electricity that occur as the magnetic fields from an EV motor changes while it spins. This isn't a problem unique to EVs at all, but we're talking about it today because EVs use magnets to power the drive motors. Every time the magnetic field flips within the motor as it turns, tiny loops of unwanted electricity are stirred up and bleed into the metal encasing components. These small fields create extra heat and waste energy—basically causing an efficiency problem that can be reduced by keeping the motor's casing warmer and naturally increasing its resistance to electricity.

The trade-off is that the pump eats energy from the battery just to keep things cool. But so does the physical resistance created using GM's method. It is a bit more complex, though, as extra machining is needed for the specific passages in Tesla's motor, plus extra parts, plumbing and the pump itself.

In short: GM is trusting physics while Tesla is trusting plumping. But in a roundabout way, the more complex way—Tesla's way—is more technologically groundbreaking. It allows the brand to cut costs inside of the motor thanks to some funky electrical wizardry and squeeze out every extra ounce of performance.

Both ways are smart, and both ways certainly work. If nothing else, it's proof that there are plenty of ways to go about achieving the same task in the EV world using wildly different methods. The question is: does the automaker prioritize efficiency or simplicity? That's what shapes the solution.",https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/lElz3g/s1/tesla-gm-electric-motor-comparison-hero.jpg,N,,2025-10-15 21:04:43.791703

“I put public lands and conservation in that category.” Public lands are, by definition, for everyone.
Public Lands as Common Ground Public lands in the U.S. have historically been contested terrain, according to Peterson.
Park-related ballot measures regularly pass with strong support from voters across the political spectrum as Americans of all political affiliations continue to use, appreciate and advocate for public lands.
But the broader issue of preserving public confidence in the organizations that oversee America’s public lands requires thoughtful consideration, according to Larson.","A recent complaint filed by an environmental advocacy group has drawn new attention to the intersection of politics, public lands and the agencies that manage them.

The complaint, brought by the Center for Biological Diversity, argues that a banner on the U.S. Forest Service website violates the Hatch Act, a 1939 law designed to prevent the use of taxpayer-funded resources for partisan political purposes.

As of October 15, 2025, the site includes a banner that reads, “The Radical Left Democrats shut down the government … President Trump has made it clear he wants to keep the government open and support those who feed, fuel, and clothe the American people.”

Whether the banner crosses a legal line remains unclear. Still, the case underscores a deeper concern: the potential erosion of political neutrality in federal land management agencies and the growing polarization of public lands and conservation efforts.

The U.S. Forest Service manages approximately 193 million acres of public land across the United States, including 154 national forests and 20 national grasslands across 43 states, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. Most of this land is open to the public for a wide range of recreational activities.

“There’s a reason the Hatch Act exists, and that’s to keep politics out of basic government functioning, particularly when discussing provision of essential services,” said Lincoln Larson, an associate professor of parks, recreation and tourism management at North Carolina State University. “I put public lands and conservation in that category.”

Public lands are, by definition, for everyone. And they offer countless benefits, including recreation, conservation of wildlife and natural resources, and support for local economies. The use of politicized language, especially when presented on official government platforms for these lands, could jeopardize the bipartisan support that has protected them for more than a century.

“If people think that parks or public lands are somehow partisan, they might be less likely to use or support them. In that case, everyone loses,” said Larson, who has conducted research on the political polarization of conservation issues.

That concern is particularly relevant today, when political identity is playing a greater role in shaping Americans’ views on a wide range of issues, from science to public health to environmental policy.

“Anytime you brand something with politics these days, it matters. In the past, people were able to hold multiple identities simultaneously. But today, our political identities seem to define pretty much everything,” Larson said.

Nils Peterson, a professor of forestry and environmental resources at NC State and one of Larson’s frequent collaborators, noted that while relatively few people may actually see messages on federal websites, the symbolism matters.

“If it becomes the norm for the political party controlling the executive branch to use federal agencies for campaigning, that might eventually encourage people to view federal agencies as partisan entities,” said Peterson, who studies public attitudes toward land management.

Public Lands as Common Ground

Public lands in the U.S. have historically been contested terrain, according to Peterson. From the Sagebrush Rebellion of the 1970s to more recent debates over energy development and land use, federal lands have often reflected deeper ideological divides.

“Fights over federal lands and land management agencies go all the way back to their origins,” Peterson said.

Conflicts usually stem from differing priorities, such as whether to allow grazing and mining activities or to protect the land for recreation and conservation, underscoring the difficulty of reconciling local needs with federal management.

Yet despite this contentious history, public lands have also emerged as one of the few policy areas to garner broad bipartisan support. In recent decades, conservation and public lands have often served as unifying issues. As Larson noted, they have acted as “a bridge, not a wedge” across political divides.

The data supports this view, according to Larson. Park-related ballot measures regularly pass with strong support from voters across the political spectrum as Americans of all political affiliations continue to use, appreciate and advocate for public lands.

But as Larson noted, that unity is fragile as political polarization threatens to turn even widely shared values into partisan battlegrounds, raising concerns not only about the sustainability of public lands but also about the neutrality of federal agencies tasked with managing them.

Hope Rises from Shared Responsibility

The outcome of the Hatch Act complaint will be decided by legal experts. But the broader issue of preserving public confidence in the organizations that oversee America’s public lands requires thoughtful consideration, according to Larson.

Growing political polarization around public lands, and the looming threat of privatization, carries consequences that are far from symbolic, potentially influencing everything from funding priorities and conservation policies to how Americans across the political spectrum experience and value these spaces.

Larson emphasized that national parks and other public lands require the dedication and support of all Americans to confront increasing challenges, including deteriorating infrastructure, insufficient staffing, climate change impacts and unprecedented levels of visitation.

“I still firmly believe that public lands can serve as a common ground.”

Sustained public engagement and investment, both in terms of advocacy and financial support, are essential to overcoming these challenges. Without widespread support, the ability to maintain and protect public lands will be significantly limited.

“Ensuring the long-term health of these shared spaces requires not just policy action, but a sustained, nationwide commitment to their stewardship,” Larson said.

As debates over budgets, shutdowns and political messaging continue, Larson reiterated that conservation has the potential to unite more than it divides. “I still firmly believe that public lands can serve as a common ground, offering a unique opportunity to bring people together, improve our quality of life, and inspire a shared sense of responsibility to protect and enjoy America’s natural and cultural treasures.”",https://cnr.ncsu.edu/news/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2025/10/mount-baker-snoqualmie-national-forest-zoshua-colah-unsplash-1146x600-1.jpeg,N,,2025-10-15 18:13:52.480703

Soon, that number will dwindle just a little, thanks to a $125 million grant from the Michigan Department of Education (MDE).

Districts across the state will receive 10 propane and 87 electric buses, which will replace older diesel-powered buses in 23 school districts.

The program is a partnership between the MDE, the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy (EGLE). It’s received support from environmental advocacy groups like It’s Electric! and Michigan Association of Pupil Transportation (MAPT).

A third round investment of the Clean Bus Energy Grant, totaling $35.9 million, paid for the 100 additional buses.

The Environmental Protection Agency provided states with $5 billion over five years to create the Clean School Bus Program. Michigan’s program was “created after that to kind of help fill the gaps that we felt the federal program was missing,” Kindra Weid, the Coalition Coordinator of It’s Electric, said.

Public schools could apply for the grant. A primary goal of increasing the number of cleaner-powered buses was to reduce diesel emissions, which are a detriment to air quality. EGLE found which areas of the state were most polluted through mapping tool MI EJScreen, Troy Hansbarger, MDE's Manager of Office of Health Safety, said.

“Our goal was to really target those areas so that we can remove a lot of those diesel buses and replace those with cleaner emission vehicles.”

Asthma is a leading cause of absenteeism, according to the state health department. Each year, as a result of asthma, about 1 in 8 Michigan students miss more than six days of school. Diesel exhaust is a common trigger of asthma.

“And so, that's like a big driver for why we want cleaner buses,” Weid said. “Some kids throughout rural Michigan are on the bus for a very long time, and that means that their exposure to diesel exhaust is extensive on the drive in and the drive home.”

Katrina Morris, the executive director of MAPT, is from West Shore Educational Service District in Northwest Michigan. She transports about 130 students across distances the size of Delaware. She hopes the cleaner-powered buses will yield quieter rides, which provide a better environment for students susceptible to sound issues.

“We carry a lot of severely, multiply impaired children that have severe needs, medical needs,” Morris said. “And so this will help them to be able to have that safer ride, which is what we are all here for.”

Already, though, the program has faced challenges at the federal level. Districts relying on federal funding were “left in the dark,” Hansbarger said.

They didn't know when those funds were to be released, so they didn't know how much they had available to them. So, they didn't know how much they needed from Michigan to complete their projects.

Other districts had chosen a bus company, like Lion Electric, that stopped servicing the U.S.

Not all the cleaner-powered buses have been purchased or entered into service yet. The grant will provide a final $44 million round of investment.

“It can’t be subsidized by the US taxpayer — the president has been 100% clear on that. And we don’t want it reliant on foreign sources like China,” Agen, executive director of the White House National Energy Dominance Council, said at Semafor’s World Economy Summit on Wednesday. “If you have American companies, and you’re not reliant on US taxpayers, that’s the hurdle to get over.”

Many components of renewable energy technologies are manufactured outside the US, and some in China. Wind and solar are among the cheapest and fastest ways to add capacity to the grid in many regions, but those suppliers are running up against policy shifts that favor baseload power like fossil fuels and nuclear. The White House has placed greater emphasis on mining operations and piping infrastructure to move fossil fuels more efficiently across the country. In recent months, Trump has reduced federal subsidies for clean energy, imposed tighter requirements, and fast-tracked fossil fuel projects.

Trump is checking gasoline and power prices every day, Agen said, adding that the administration is working to speed the production of fossil fuel projects to compete with solar and wind power, which are often easier to build. “That’s why we’ve changed permitting. That’s why we’ve changed some of the way we’re looking at funding,” he said.

Clint Woods spoke at a recent hearing about the Clean Air Act at the U.S. House Committee on Energy and Commerce.

The last major update to the Clean Air Act was 35 years ago. Though rules that come out of the act are updated more frequently — like the National Ambient Air Quality Standards, which are updated about every five years.

On the new limits for soot

Woods said the federal government should repeal the Biden administration’s standard for soot — pollution that can harm your heart and lungs that often comes from things like cars, factories and coal plants.

The Environmental Protection Agency under former President Joe Biden lowered the amount of soot allowed from 12 micrograms per cubic meter to 9 micrograms. Woods said while most of Indiana is expected to meet the stricter standard, it's doesn't leave much ""headroom.""

“It really limits the ability of new investment to come in — whether that's a data center new energy generation opportunity for advanced manufacturing. And so, that really is a limiting factor in a state like ours,"" Woods said.

Woods called the standard “legally and scientifically dubious” but didn’t explain why. Like most EPA rules, industry had the opportunity to weigh-in on the new soot standard.

Janet McCabe served as the deputy EPA administrator under Biden. She is a visiting professor with the Indiana University McKinney School of Law and affiliated with IU's Environmental Resilience Institute.

She said the National Ambient Air Quality Standards — like the one for soot — are one of the biggest decisions that the EPA takes on.

""It is highly documented and supported. And I actually think that of all the pollutants out there, there is the most agreement around particulate matter,"" McCabe said. ""The science shows that there is no threshold below which it is safe to breathe in particulate matter. The risk gets less and less as you get lower and lower. But the in terms of lives saved and health improved, when you lower that standard, you are protecting public health. So I really would wonder about statements that question the how well that decision was supported.""

The new standard is expected to save thousands of lives in the U.S. every year — including in Indiana's metro areas.

On EPA's review of state decisions

Woods said the EPA often “second-guesses” Indiana’s decisions — like its plans for implementing federal air quality standards and the permits it grants for facilities that pollute. He said this causes delays, threatening the state’s ability to compete for business.

""[EPA's review process sometimes] expands issues that are not within that key provision of the act and that narrowing that review process would go a long way to ensure that you don't have delays in key projects and that state-led delegated programs that work effectively in providing environmentally protective and legally durable permits could move much more quickly,"" Woods said.

McCabe said when permit reviews take a while, it's often because there are complicated issues at play. She said it’s the agency’s job to make sure things like permitting are done properly and consistently across the country.

""This is a partnership and EPA should not be micromanaging states — but does have a legitimate role to play,"" she said. ""Especially when members of the public have brought questions to EPA about either whether things are properly explained, whether input from the community has been responded to and and whether decisions are adequately explained and documented.""

On wildfire smoke and pollution that crosses state lines

Woods said the Clean Air Act also needs to do more to ensure that states like Indiana aren’t penalized for pollution that’s out of its control — like wildfire smoke from Canada or ozone pollution that may have drifted from Chicago.

""A week or two of catastrophic wildfire in California emits more greenhouse gasses an entire year of all energy-related activity in Indiana. So those things are incredibly impactful,"" Woods said.

He said environmental regulators now have a better ability to understand where pollution is coming from than what they did 35 years ago — and those tools need to be updated.

McCabe said while states shouldn't be held responsible for pollution they can't control, it’s important for the EPA to make sure wildfires are, in fact, the cause of that excess pollution.

""We're having more and more of these [wildfires]. If you have a couple a year, then it's not so hard. If you have dozens and dozens and dozens a year, then it they can build up and become a backlog and take a long time. And and so it's not crazy to say, let's look at that process and make sure it's as efficient as possible,"" she said.

McCabe said the issue of pollution crossing state lines into Indiana is nothing new. It's part of the reason why the Lake Michigan Air Directors Consortium exists — to help understand what causes air pollution in the region and discuss solutions.

""But you also need to pay attention to what the people who live in your state are exposed to day to day, and do your best to protect them from even more air pollution,"" she said.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/094a409/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2744x1441+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fa3%2Fde%2Fec30ae1947229eff67058875407b%2Fclintwoods2.PNG,N,,2025-10-15 21:05:45.647469

But the new policy actually supports several forms of renewable energy, including biomass, hydropower and geothermal. In an interesting development, marine energy sourced from the movement of oceans and rivers also meets the plan’s 24/7 deliverability standard, and recent moves open the door for a plentiful new source of clean electricity for coastal communities and ocean-based industries.

Marine energy and the American Energy Dominance plan

The American Energy Dominance plan provides federal support for energy resources that can deliver electricity on a reliable 24/7 basis — regardless of seasonal changes, weather conditions or time of day. That standard includes coal, oil and natural gas along with nuclear energy. It excludes wind and solar energy, declining to recognize that modern energy storage and grid management systems can cover those gaps in wind and solar availability.

In contrast, biomass, hydropower and geothermal power plants can operate on a 24/7 basis, meeting the same standard that applies to fossil fuels and nuclear energy. The January 20 presidential Executive Order titled “Unleashing American Energy” lists biomass and hydropower among the resources to be supported. In February, Energy Secretary Chris Wright followed up with another order, titled “Unleashing the Golden Age of American Energy Dominance,” which also mentioned hydropower along with geothermal.

Neither document refers directly to marine power sourced from devices that transfer the kinetic energy of waves, tides and currents into electricity. But it meets the 24/7 standard, and the Department of Energy continues host an online footprint for its Marine Energy Program.

“The power coursing through oceans and rivers equates to nearly 60 percent of the United States’ total electricity needs,” the Energy Department’s program webpage reads reads, referring to resources that are technically available, but not necessarily recoverable.

Shipping, fishing and other existing uses are among the factors that can limit the amount of marine energy that is actually recoverable. Even so, marine energy has potential to play a key role in the U.S. energy profile. “Even if only a small portion of the energy from these waterways is harvested, marine energy could still make significant contributions to the nation’s energy needs and provide millions of Americans with locally-sourced, reliable and affordable energy,” according to the Energy Department.

Signs of life for marine power at the U.S. Department of Energy

As may be expected, the Marine Energy Program has not publicized any new projects in 2025, but the agency did expand a longstanding agreement with Norway to include marine energy.

The department has worked with Norway’s Royal Ministry of Energy on hydropower since 2004. By combining the work of U.S. national laboratories and Norway’s SINTEF Energy Research, the partners developed new ways to modernize and improve the efficiency of hydropower systems, which use dams to generate power from rivers. In an updated agreedment signed in July, they’re now setting their sights on deploying marine energy systems to harness the natural movement of oceans and other water sources. “We are building upon our two nations’ shared expertise and advanced marine energy technologies to support President Trump’s pro-growth energy agenda for the American people,” Energy Secretary Wright emphasized.

A newly purchased 3D printer may also help a key U.S. research lab, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), to fine-tune more marine energy devices. Developed by the Tennessee startup One-Off Robotics, the new laser-powered metal 3D-printing system can create specialty parts capable of withstanding the merciless force of ocean currents — creating new pathways for NREL research into marine power.

Instead of waiting for up to nine months for a single part to arrive from a remote factory, research teams at the lab can now fabricate their own parts, on site, in a matter of days. “We have a good amount of experience doing rapid prototyping and additive manufacturing with smaller machines,” said Casey Nichols, an NREL research engineer focused on novel marine energy technologies, in a statement. “But getting a larger 3D printer lets us do more at-scale research.”

The new resource will allow researchers to perform real-life testing on full-scale prototypes more rapidly and economically, and help them to assess how 3D printing can reduce the cost of manufacturing marine energy devices for the commercial market, Nichols said.

Developers are moving forward with marine energy in the U.S., with or without federal support

While the U.S. Department of Energy could opt to push ahead or pull back from funding new marine energy development programs, developers and researchers continue to show potential for growth in the U.S. market. In 2023, for example, the Israeli startup EcoWave Power committed to a install a pilot-scale version of its new wave energy harvesting system at the Port of Los Angeles in California, with 50 percent of the funding provided by Shell through its Marine Energy Program.

Switched on earlier this year, the system consists of a row of bright blue floaters fixed to a jetty that bob up and down with every wave, creating hydraulic pressure which drives a generator to produce electricity. It’s meant to serves as a demonstration and educational platform to show what wave power can do. “We know there’s incredible potential for wave energy to power our communities and protect our environment,” U.S. Rep. Nanette Barragán said on a recent visit to the Eco Wave installation. Barragán represents the communities around the Port of Los Angeles and last week introduced the $1 billion Marine Energy Technologies Acceleration Act to channel more federal support to the fledgling industry.",https://triplepundit.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/cropped-3P-Icon-32x32.png,N,,2025-10-15 18:11:34.778760

China’s investments in South American energy infrastructure encompass two distinct sectors: energy generation and energy distribution.
China’s initial investments in South America stressed the generation aspect, focused on megaprojects billed as dramatically boosting host countries’ energy supply.
Energy infrastructure, along with ports, railways, and telecommunications, all constitute elements of this physical sanctions network.
To begin, the United States should seek to boost the ability of South American regulators to spot and prevent problematic investments in their energy infrastructure.","In Lima, Peru, electricity to the city of 10 million is controlled by just two companies, China Southern Power Grid International (CSGI) and China Three Gorges Corporation. Both are state-owned enterprises based in the People’s Republic of China (PRC). Together, these firms account for 54 percent and 46 percent of the electricity distribution to a city that is home to roughly one-third of the population of Peru. Even setting aside geopolitical considerations, such a degree of market concentration would normally turn heads; the fact that this structure provides a direct line to a foreign government should be cause for further alarm.

Peru is not alone in this story. In neighboring Chile, Chinese companies account for roughly two-thirds of power distribution, while in Brazil, China has poured billions into electricity transmission projects. These investments curtail strategic autonomy and shape the options available to countries for housing and industrial policy, and, in a worst-case scenario, could be actively weaponized by the PRC.

However, China’s growing presence in South American energy generation and distribution has largely gone underreported, even as it risks placing critical infrastructure under foreign influence. Properly grasping the nature of this influence is of particular importance as the United States finds itself in the midst of a shift to a more competitive stance in its foreign policy approach in the Western Hemisphere.

Under the Trump administration, Washington appears increasingly willing to ask countries to choose between the United States and the PRC. From ports along the Panama Canal to space observatories in the Atacama, infrastructure projects subject to Chinese influence are facing drastically heightened pressure. In a world of more sharp-elbowed foreign policy, control over critical infrastructure—or the generation capacity to power it—gives China influence that trade relationships and diplomatic ties cannot buy. As the United States amps up its efforts to displace China from key infrastructure in the region, it seems increasingly likely that China will fall back to its power position in regional energy projects as a backstop.

Energy: A Win-Win Collaboration?

South America has all the tools at its disposal to become a global energy leader, and a remarkably green one at that. While the continent is home to vast reserves of oil and natural gas, it also possesses lithium to build batteries and solar cells, and powerful rivers to generate hydropower. The region has even experimented with more emerging technologies like geothermal power in a bid to further diversify energy sources.

However, recent events have shown that this energy potential has yet to be realized or otherwise rests on unsteady foundations. In February 2025, Chile was roiled by country-wide blackouts that left millions without power and led to widespread disruptions in the country’s crucial mining and industrial sectors as well. Reliance on hydropower in countries like Ecuador and Brazil has helped make grids less carbon-intensive, but also increases vulnerability to climate change–induced droughts, which sap the rivers needed to power hydroelectric dams and create tension with local communities who rely on the same sources for drinking water and irrigation.

For this reason, South American governments have been eager to cultivate international partnerships to better develop their energy resources and increase the reliability of their electrical grids. Both are areas where the PRC has eagerly entered the fray.

China’s investments in South American energy infrastructure encompass two distinct sectors: energy generation and energy distribution. The first of these concerns power plants and generators that produce energy, typically by burning fossil fuels or else through hydroelectric dams, wind, or solar farms. Distribution involves sending the energy produced from these power plants first to substations closer to population centers via transmission lines, and then eventually to individual households, businesses, or factories.

China’s initial investments in South America stressed the generation aspect, focused on megaprojects billed as dramatically boosting host countries’ energy supply. China’s own massive power buildout and success with megaprojects like the Three Gorges Dam meant PRC-based firms brought extensive technical expertise to the table, typically at far lower costs than U.S. or European competitors. These initiatives nevertheless left a checkered history, saddling recipients with unsustainable levels of debt and leaving behind a string of allegations of environmental malpractice.

Power Corrupts

Ecuador is particularly illustrative of the way courting the PRC for energy investment can undermine national sovereignty and crimp strategic autonomy. Beginning in 2009, then-President Rafael Correa agreed to a $1 billion loan from China to be secured against Ecuador’s oil industry. This loan would be the first of many that Correa would sign, leveraging China’s demand for oil in exchange for development financing. Indeed, just one year later, Ecuador would take out another $1.7 billion from the China Import-Export Bank to help finance the construction of the Coca Codo Sinclair hydroelectric dam. Intended to be a legacy-defining project for Correa and deliver massive returns to the Ecuadorian economy in the form of cheap, plentiful, clean energy, the project has turned into a boondoggle and symbol of failed PRC megaprojects in the region.

Even at the time of its construction, concerns about the dam were widespread. Independent reviews by experts cited inconsistent water levels, meaning that the advertised 1,500 megawatts of installed generation capacity could only be achieved under certain conditions. The dam’s location, near the active Reventador volcano, meant it would come under significant geological stress, which could potentially trigger a collapse of the structure if poorly designed. Since coming online in 2016, the dam has vindicated these criticisms and more. It has operated at closer to 59 percent of capacity since an initial full-power test compromised Ecuador’s electrical grid. Shoddy construction coupled with geological activity has led to more than 17,000 cracks in the dam being reported, leading experts to deem the facility a “time bomb.” Finally, the $3 billion final price tag of the project, and $19 billion in total loans taken from China under the Correa government, have saddled Ecuador with an unsustainable debt burden and birthed still-simmering corruption scandals.

Despite the sordid history of Ecuador’s engagement with China, Beijing’s influence over the South American country persists. Since Correa, three successive governments have continued to sell oil at discounted rates to the PRC as part of the country’s debt service. According to a 2022 report from the National Assembly, this arrangement caused Ecuador to forgo some $5 billion in oil revenues had it been able to sell at market prices instead. Meanwhile, Chinese oil companies Sinopec and China National Petroleum Corporation obtained licenses to drill on Ecuadorian territory in 2021 and 2022, respectively. Most recently, the government of President Daniel Noboa announced it had reached an agreement with state-owned electricity company PowerChina to assume control of operations at Coca Codo Sinclair. As part of the deal, PowerChina would invest an additional $400 million in Ecuador’s energy sector, focused on renewable power generation and storage.

In Peru as well, China Three Gorges has acquired a dominant position in both the generation and transmission sectors, with potentially harmful consequences for consumers in the country. In 2018, it purchased the Chaglla hydroelectric dam from embattled Brazilian company Odebrecht. Then, in 2020, it took a majority stake in Luz del Sur, an electrical utility responsible for the majority of power distribution to Lima. Peruvian regulators and civil society at the time feared this concentration could prejudice competition, allowing China Three Gorges to essentially buy power from itself, letting it manipulate rates at will. Accordingly, Luz del Sur was prohibited from buying power from generators owned by China Three Gorges without a bidding process. When CSGI acquired Italian electrical utility Enel’s infrastructure in Peru in 2023, a similar stipulation was imposed. However, according to one analysis, these provisions may merely forestall the inevitable, as they will expire in 2030, at which point, both China Three Gorges and CSGI will be well-positioned to squeeze remaining competitors out of the Peruvian market.

The PRC’s increasing investments in transmission infrastructure could also pave the way for further dominance of South America’s digital domain. China is a major supplier of smart meters, providing some 600,000 meters to Uruguay in 2021. This technology is vital for the region, where power loss, energy that is generated but never makes it to the consumer, is as high as 15 percent. Smart meters can prevent power loss by monitoring electricity use in real time and relaying that information back to distributors who can reroute power to correct inefficiencies. But smart meters also create new cybersecurity vulnerabilities, particularly when, as in the case of Uruguay, they are connected to and routed through national telecommunications networks. Petty criminals already hack smart meters to dodge fees, and Russia-linked hackers have targeted power grids in Ukraine and Lithuania with cyberattacks, underscoring the importance of shoring up digital defenses for this critical infrastructure. Research from Oregon State University has further shown how a cyberattack could exploit smart meters themselves to simulate oscillations in the grid, causing power shut-offs. These risks are further magnified when the malicious actor is not a criminal group, but rather the supplier of the meters, who could have access to zero-day vulnerabilities.

Reenergizing Competition

Whether along the Panama Canal or Mexican car imports, the United States is increasingly applying pressure against Latin American governments to minimize their ties to China and has shown itself willing to use hard power threats and tariffs to do so. While China is working diligently to minimize its own exposure to U.S. economic sanctions, it also appears to be seeking to build its own system of physical infrastructure sanctions. Energy infrastructure, along with ports, railways, and telecommunications, all constitute elements of this physical sanctions network. Countries that have come to depend on Chinese companies to move goods, illuminate their cities, and provide internet to their people will likely be loath to turn against the PRC for fear of losing its support in these essential functions.

While the PRC is already well-entrenched in South America’s energy sector, it is not immovably so. More canny commercial diplomacy and capacity-building could go a long way to defang China’s infrastructure dominance strategy in the Americas. In doing so, the United States, alongside partner governments, should strive to employ “insulation” strategies, not seeking to extirpate Chinese influence entirely, but rather to minimize the potential that the PRC could leverage its position to coerce governments.

To begin, the United States should seek to boost the ability of South American regulators to spot and prevent problematic investments in their energy infrastructure. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) serves to review foreign investments in the United States and ensure these do not leave a potential malign actor in control of critical infrastructure. No South American government possesses an equivalent to CFIUS, and while many countries have regulatory bodies that exist to prevent harmful concentration in a given sector, these entities often lack the tools to identify and respond to China’s opaque business practices. The United States should consider connecting CFIUS representatives to countries in the region to highlight best practices and help countries stand up their own equivalents, either as independent agencies or constituent bodies of regulators. All of this can be done in the name of bolstering national sovereignty and preserving strategic autonomy—goals that should strongly resonate with Latin American countries as great power competition increases.

The United States can also employ “competition” strategies aimed at encouraging U.S. and allied power companies to return to South America. While China has gained ground in recent years, Western companies like Sempra, Bechtel, and Enel all have a current or recent history in the region and remain globally competitive players. Brazil may be a promising first step in this regard, as the country is currently facing challenges integrating new wind and solar projects into its grid. These energy sources have high intermittency, meaning they fluctuate significantly over the course of the day in terms of how much power is produced, and are difficult to integrate into legacy transmission infrastructure. Recent reports have found that some Brazilian states, like Bahia, may need to intentionally reduce solar and wind production by as much as 30 percent below full capacity to keep the grid stable. While China dominates in selling wind and solar equipment, the United States has a qualitative management in the kinds of advanced grid technologies and data management platforms Brazil needs to effectively modernize its energy supply. The Department of Commerce, in partnership with U.S. embassies in the region, can identify upcoming tenders for strategic energy projects and bring delegations of U.S. companies to encourage them to bid on these.

Finally, financial institutions, especially the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC), Export-Import Bank, and Inter-American Development Bank, can play an enabling role in supporting U.S. bids for energy generation and transmission infrastructure. Particularly as the DFC heads towards reauthorization in the U.S. Congress, bolstering its authorities to work in South America should be a priority for any America-first development strategy.

WASHINGTON — A federal judge issued a temporary restraining order Wednesday, blocking the Trump administration from moving forward with the thousands of layoffs it initiated after the government shutdown began Oct. 1, as well as any others that officials might want to carry out.

The hearing in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California took place at the same time White House budget director Russ Vought appeared on the conservative Charlie Kirk podcast to preview his next steps.

Vought warned the initial Reductions in Force, the technical term for a layoff notice, were just “a snapshot” and that as many as 10,000 federal workers would lose their jobs if the shutdown drags on.

“We’re going to keep those RIFs rolling throughout this shutdown because we think it’s important to stay on offense for the American taxpayer and the American people,” Vought said. “We want to be very aggressive where we can be in shuttering the bureaucracy, not just the funding, but the bureaucracy.”

Judge Susan Illston said during the hearing that she granted the temporary restraining order because Trump administration officials had “taken advantage of the lapse in government spending, government functioning to assume that all bets are off, that the laws don’t apply to them anymore and that they can impose the structures that they like on the government situation that they don’t like.”

Illston said laws and regulations still apply during a shutdown and that, by all appearances, the Trump administration's actions in the case are politically motivated.

“Things are being done before they’re thought through — very much ready, fire, aim,” Illston said.

The ruling will put the approximately 4,000 layoffs noticed during the shutdown on hold as the court case proceeds.

DOJ unprepared to speak on merits of case

Elizabeth Hedges, a Justice Department attorney arguing the case on behalf of the Trump administration, said several times during the brief hearing she wasn’t prepared to speak about the merits of the case — a position that confounded the judge, who gave Hedges several chances to reverse course.

“We may be able to address the merits at the next stage,” Hedges said, after telling Illston she would need to check with others before making any statements about why the administration believes its actions are legal.

Danielle Leonard, an attorney representing the labor unions that brought the lawsuit, urged the judge to grant a temporary restraining order for all the departments and agencies that make up the executive branch, not just those that have announced RIFs.

Leonard said she believes Trump administration officials have decided how many additional federal employees to lay off during the shutdown, but have opted not to share that information with the court.

“The decision has been made, it's just a question of implementation and timing,” Leonard said, around the same time Vought was giving his podcast interview.

Illston, who was nominated by former President Bill Clinton, said at the end of the hearing she expected the attorneys to find a day in the coming weeks when they can attend a hearing on the next stage, which would be a preliminary injunction.

Senate deadlocks for ninth time

On the other side of the country, Republicans and Democrats continued to spar on Capitol Hill over the reasons for the shutdown, as the Senate failed for a ninth time to advance a short-term government spending bill.

The 51-44 vote was nearly identical to the others that have taken place since mid-September, and neither side appeared inclined to make concessions or even try to negotiate.

Nevada Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto and Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman, both Democrats, and Maine independent Sen. Angus King voted with Republicans to advance the bill. Kentucky GOP Sen. Rand Paul voted no.

Democrats maintain there must be a bipartisan deal to extend the enhanced tax credits that are set to expire at the end of this year for people who get their health insurance from the Affordable Care Act Marketplace.

GOP leaders said they are willing to begin negotiations on that issue, but only after Democrats vote to advance the stopgap bill that would fund government through Nov. 21.

The House voted mostly along party lines to approve the legislation in mid-September, but it has remained stalled in the Senate ever since, unable to garner the 60 votes needed to advance toward final passage. Republicans control the chamber with 53 seats.

Congress needs to approve the stopgap bill since it, once again, failed to approve all 12 of the full-year government funding bills by the Oct. 1 start of the new fiscal year.

The only other way to end the funding lapse would be for both chambers to reach a broadly bipartisan consensus on all of those appropriations bills.

Layoffs across agencies

The layoffs initiated by the Trump administration during the shutdown were detailed further on Tuesday in court filings from the labor unions’ attorneys as well as Trump administration officials.

Stephen Billy, senior adviser at the Office of Management and Budget, wrote the number of layoff notices had changed since Friday when he outlined the Reductions in Force to the court.

The numbers have fluctuated significantly for some departments, but not for all.

Commerce: Approximately 600 employees, up from 315

Education: Remained at 466 employees

Health and Human Services: 982 employees, down from a range of 1,100 to 1,200

Housing and Urban Development: Stayed at 442 employees

Homeland Security: Decreased to 54 from 176 employees

Treasury: Reduced somewhat to 1,377 employees, from 1,446

Energy, EPA layoffs

Federal workers at those departments have 60 days between when the notice was sent and when they will no longer have jobs, though a different standard is in place at the Energy Department and the Environmental Protection Agency.

Energy officials, the document says, “issued a general RIF notice informing 179 employees that they may receive a specific notice in the future if it is determined they will be part of any RIF. If so, that notice would provide the relevant notice period.”

But a spokesperson for the Energy Department emailed States Newsroom on Tuesday evening to confirm officials had issued RIF notices to workers in the Offices of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Clean Energy Demonstrations, State and Community Energy Programs and Minority Economic Impact.

“All these offices played a major role in the Biden administration’s war on American Energy,” the spokesperson wrote. “They oversaw billions of dollars in wasteful spending and massive regulatory overreach, resulting in more expensive and less reliable energy. These offices are being realigned to reflect the Trump administration’s commitment to advancing affordable, reliable, and secure energy for the American people and a more responsible stewardship of taxpayer dollars.”

Further confusing the situation at the Energy Department, a footnote in the court document filed by Billy said that particular agency isn’t actually experiencing a lapse in funding.

The Billy court document said EPA officials sent 28 employees “intent to RIF” notices and will send formal RIF notices “to any affected employees at least 60 days prior to the effective date.”

A separate document, filed by Thomas J. Nagy Jr., deputy assistant secretary for Human Resources at HHS, said “data discrepancies and processing errors” led to 1,760 employees receiving layoff notices instead of the intended 982.

“Employees have been working since October 10, 2025, to rescind the notices that had been issued in error,” Nagy wrote.

At CDC, 'eliminating entire offices'

Yolanda Jacobs, president of the American Federation of Government Employees Local 2883, wrote in a brief to the court that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention “issued RIF notices to approximately 1,300 employees, eliminating entire offices at the agency. Then, within 24 hours, the CDC rescinded approximately 700 of those RIF notices.”

Jacobs wrote the 600 CDC workers who received RIFs will officially lose their jobs on Dec. 8, even though they have already lost access to work email and computers.

“Many Union members have told me that they are experiencing serious mental health problems and have found it very difficult to get their work done, given all of the turmoil that they have experienced this year,” Jacobs wrote, referencing previous RIF notices and reinstatements. “Members have told me that they worry on a day-to-day basis about whether they will have a job the next day. They said that they have felt like the Trump Administration has been using them as bargaining chips this year.”

Jacobs wrote that the Trump administration has decided to lay off many human resources workers, which had blocked other workers who received RIFs from being able to get information about how to roll over their health insurance coverage.

During past RIFs, she wrote, workers had “access to the employment records, including paystubs and performance records, that they need for processing their separations,” but cannot since they are locked out of computer systems.

Layoffs hit Department of Education

Rachel Gittleman, president of AFGE Local 252, which represents nearly 3,000 Education Department workers, wrote in a separate filing the layoffs will impact numerous programs, including civil rights, communications and outreach, elementary and secondary education, post secondary education, and special education and rehabilitative services.

“Receiving RIF notices has caused many employees enormous stress. A father of two young boys contacted me—he just moved into a new home and relies on his job to support his family,” Gittleman wrote. “He told me (he) doesn’t know what he will do next.”

Workers on maternity or disability leave also received layoff notices, “forcing them to job-hunt and face financial insecurity while managing newborns or health conditions,” she wrote.

Following past RIF notices, the department provided “career transitioning and counseling, benefits and retirement training, and access to other human resources and employee assistance programs.” But Gittleman wrote that isn’t happening this time.

‘Devastated’ HUD employees

Ashaki Robinson, regional vice president for AFGE Council 222, which represents nearly 5,000 HUD workers, said the layoff notices for that department will impact employees in Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Massachusetts, Puerto Rico, Texas and Washington, D.C., who manage a variety of programs.

“They are devastated that the RIF is happening and are very concerned about losing their incomes, health insurance coverage for themselves and dependents, and other employment benefits in 60 days, when they will be separated from employment,” Robinson wrote.

The hundreds of HUD workers who have received RIF notices, she wrote, were “targeted for termination not because of anything they did themselves, but because of decisions made by elected officials that may have been driven by politics.”",https://cdn.newsfromthestates.com/styles/social_large/s3/2025-10/arboretumclosed_0.jpg?h=f361150e&itok=wFwzMgxG,N,,2025-10-15 18:13:16.193464

“The administration’s unwillingness to negotiate but rather prepare to use the shutdown as an opportunity to fire more federal workers and permanently destroy programs focused on protecting American families continues to demonstrate the cruelty with which Trump governs,” said Quentin Scott, federal policy director for the Chesapeake Climate Action Network (CCAN) Action Fund.

On Oct. 10, a court filing from the United States Office of Management and Budget stated that more than 4,000 federal workers across seven agencies received Reductions in Force (RIF) notices. Approximately 187 employees from the Department of Energy (DOE) received layoff notices, and 20 to 30 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) employees were told they could possibly receive an RIF in the future.

According to the National Park Service’s (NPS) contingency plan, published ahead of the shutdown, approximately 9,296 of the agency’s 14,500 employees were expected to be furloughed. Because of this, more than 35 former park superintendents sent a letter to the Trump administration, urging the parks be closed in the event of a shutdown.

The previous 2018 impasse left the NPS without sufficient personnel to take care of and protect the parks, meaning many landscapes suffered vandalism and destruction.

Theresa Pierno, president and CEO of the National Parks Conservation Association (NPCA), described leaving park gates open to the public during the shutdown as both irresponsible and dangerous.

“Our national parks have never been more at risk,” Pierno said in a statement. “Congress must immediately fund the government, fully support the Park Service and its staff, and stop any more devastating cuts, before it’s too late.”

Clean Energy Innovation at Risk

On Oct. 2, the day after the shutdown began, DOE announced that 321 financial awards supporting 223 projects could face termination. The discontinued awards were supplied by branches that championed innovative energy technologies, such as the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations (OCED), Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Grid Deployment Office(GDO) and others.

Maryland is one of the many states affected by these funding cuts, as 12 projects costing almost $88 million will be canceled. According to a list published by the Democratic members of the House Appropriations Committee’s, some of the terminated award recipients in Maryland include: the Power 52 Foundation, which offers employment in the solar industry and other green job industries to underserved adults; and ClearlyEnergy, which uses climate policy analysis and software development to create a sustainable and energy-efficient future.

In response to these funding cuts, members of the Maryland Congressional delegation released a statement condemning both the shutdown and the attack on clean energy and sustainability initiatives, calling the dismantling of these projects “partisan” and “likely illegal.”

“Terminating these lawfully approved projects will raise energy prices for Maryland families, threaten good-paying American infrastructure jobs and prevent local energy companies from enhancing grid flexibility and improving the resilience of the power system against extreme weather,” delegation members wrote.

In the joint statement, delegates stated they consider the termination of such projects as the current administration’s way of leaving American business and families to fend for themselves.

“We will continue pushing Republicans to responsibly fund the government and end this shameful shutdown,” the group of Maryland leaders continued.

Washington will also be affected by the DOE’s cuts, as a $4.8 million reward to the Interstate Renewable Energy Council (IREC) was canceled, per the House Appropriations Committee’s list. Since the IREC is a nonprofit that is adamantly building the foundation for accessible renewable energy, and the District has a goal of completely relying on clean energy sources by 2032, this could be detrimental to the city’s vision for a sustainable future.

As Congress remains in a standstill— not able to agree on a funding plan— more environmental programs are at risk of being cut, threatening the fight for cleaner and affordable energy and the preservation of treasured landscapes.

“Government shutdowns are painful, but the pain the Trump administration has inflicted on the American people has arguably been even worse,” Scott, who has served as CCAN’s policy director since 2021. “Reopening the government in a bipartisan way is the only path forward.”",https://www.washingtoninformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-94.jpg,N,,2025-10-15 17:09:08.883761

ChargePoint will begin rolling out 600 kW chargers in the country, promising they will top up an EV in 10 minutes.","ChargePoint plans to roll out 600-kW chargers starting next year.

There are no EVs currently available or even planned for release in the U.S. that need that much charging power.

The most powerful EV chargers currently operational in America top out at 400 kW.

By now, it's no secret that China is way ahead in the electric-vehicle race, and the rest of the world has little potential of catching up. That includes EV charging infrastructure. The Chinese market now has several cars for sale that charge at 1 megawatt—1,000 kilowatts—and public charging stations are ready to provide that power.

In practical terms, that means EV recharging can be done in about five minutes or so. That's being billed as a game-changer in China because it puts EV charging on par with the time it takes to fill up a gas car.

Right behind China is Europe, which has lots of EVs and an expansive network of chargers. But no cars here charge quicker than 400 kW, and there are only a handful that can hit that number.

But even more powerful chargers are coming to the U.S. next year, according to USA Today. ChargePoint will begin rolling out 600 kW chargers in the country, promising they will top up an EV in 10 minutes.

Now, that would be true if there were any EVs that can take that kind of charging power, but there aren’t—and none are on the horizon, either in the U.S. or in Europe.

Europe’s most powerful chargers generally top out at 420 kW, although these are pretty rare. Some 600 kW units are coming this year and next. In the U.S., Gravity offers the most powerful chargers around, which provide up to 500 kW of power. But only EV is currently on sale that charges at more than 350 kW. The Lucid Gravity can take 400 kW, and it will be joined next year by the BMW iX3 and Porsche Cayenne EV, which will match it.

These 600 kW stalls will be present in ChargePoint Express charging stations with help from electronics giant Eaton. The charging giant notes that these new chargers will require a 30% lower investment than before, have a 30% smaller footprint and bring a 30% reduction in operating costs.

The company didn’t say exactly how many of these it plans to roll out or where they will be installed, but it is future-proofing these chargers while waiting for EVs with more charging power to appear on the U.S. market.

When will we see EVs capable of taking 600 kW of power in the States? Well, there are no plans by American or European manufacturers to make any with those kinds of numbers, so unless the sky-high import tariffs on Chinese electric cars disappear overnight and the market gets flooded by fast-charging models from the People’s Republic (which may happen in neighboring Canada), it doesn’t look like it will be anytime soon.

You can’t really charge a 400-volt EV much higher than 250 kW. Teslas and the Volvo EX90 are examples of EVs that run on 400-volt architectures and can achieve that peak charging rate. But to go higher than that, you need to go to 800 volts or more, because otherwise you would need such a high amperage that no public charger could provide. Cars like the Porsche Macan EV and the upcoming BMW iX have a voltage close to that. And the Lucid Gravity actually runs at over 900 volts (up to 926 volts, to be precise), similar numbers to China’s EVs capable of megawatt charging rates.

For more info, read our Privacy Policy & Terms of Use.

So Lucid could, in the future, update the Gravity (and the Air sedan, which currently tops out at 300 kW) to charge even quicker because they have the voltage to do it. But otherwise, there’s not much use for 600 kW chargers in the United States with the current outlook for EVs. Hyundai and Kia recommend a 350 kW charger for their E-GMP-based EVs to be able to achieve their full charging potential, although they don’t charge at more than 240 kW currently, even with their 800-volt architecture.

This is because only a 350 kW charger can sustain the 800 volts and 300 amps that these cars need to reach the peak advertised charging power. You can still charge them from a 250 kW charger, and they will still have excellent charging performance, but they won’t reach the advertised peak. So there is a point to having chargers that provide more than a vehicle’s maximum claimed charging power, but there are currently no cars that require 600 kW.

We actually tried China’s five-minute chargers with peak speeds of over 1 megawatt, and once you see one in action and how quickly it actually replenishes a battery, the Lucid Gravity, with its 10%-80% charging time of around 23 minutes, isn’t as impressive. BMW says the iX3 can do the 10%-80% charging dash in 21 minutes, but nobody has tested one to see how well it actually does.",https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/MkM9XN/s1/chargepoint-and-eaton.jpg,N,,2025-10-15 18:11:03.887419

Clint Woods spoke at a recent hearing about the Clean Air Act at the U.S. House Committee on Energy and Commerce.

The last major update to the Clean Air Act was 35 years ago. Though rules that come out of the act are updated more frequently — like the National Ambient Air Quality Standards, which are updated about every five years.

On the new limits for soot

Woods said the federal government should repeal the Biden administration's standard for soot — pollution that can harm your heart and lungs that often comes from things like cars, factories and coal plants.

The Environmental Protection Agency under former President Joe Biden lowered the amount of soot allowed from 12 micrograms per cubic meter to 9 micrograms. Woods said while most of Indiana is expected to meet the stricter standard, it's doesn't leave much ""headroom.""

""It really limits the ability of new investment to come in — whether that's a data center new energy generation opportunity for advanced manufacturing. And so, that really is a limiting factor in a state like ours,"" Woods said.

Woods called the standard ""legally and scientifically dubious"" but didn't explain why. Like most EPA rules, industry had the opportunity to weigh-in on the new soot standard.

Janet McCabe served as the deputy EPA administrator under Biden. She is a visiting professor with the Indiana University McKinney School of Law and affiliated with IU's Environmental Resilience Institute.

She said the National Ambient Air Quality Standards — like the one for soot — are one of the biggest decisions that the EPA takes on.

""It is highly documented and supported. And I actually think that of all the pollutants out there, there is the most agreement around particulate matter,"" McCabe said. ""The science shows that there is no threshold below which it is safe to breathe in particulate matter. The risk gets less and less as you get lower and lower. But the in terms of lives saved and health improved, when you lower that standard, you are protecting public health. So I really would wonder about statements that question the how well that decision was supported.""

The new standard is expected to save thousands of lives in the U.S. every year — including in Indiana's metro areas.

On EPA's review of state decisions

Woods said the EPA often ""second-guesses"" Indiana's decisions — like its plans for implementing federal air quality standards and the permits it grants for facilities that pollute. He said this causes delays, threatening the state's ability to compete for business.

""[EPA's review process sometimes] expands issues that are not within that key provision of the act and that narrowing that review process would go a long way to ensure that you don't have delays in key projects and that state-led delegated programs that work effectively in providing environmentally protective and legally durable permits could move much more quickly,"" Woods said.

McCabe said when permit reviews take a while, it's often because there are complicated issues at play. She said it's the agency's job to make sure things like permitting are done properly and consistently across the country.

""This is a partnership and EPA should not be micromanaging states — but does have a legitimate role to play,"" she said. ""Especially when members of the public have brought questions to EPA about either whether things are properly explained, whether input from the community has been responded to and and whether decisions are adequately explained and documented.""

On wildfire smoke and pollution that crosses state lines

Woods said the Clean Air Act also needs to do more to ensure that states like Indiana aren't penalized for pollution that's out of its control — like wildfire smoke from Canada or ozone pollution that may have drifted from Chicago.

""A week or two of catastrophic wildfire in California emits more greenhouse gasses an entire year of all energy-related activity in Indiana. So those things are incredibly impactful,"" Woods said.

He said environmental regulators now have a better ability to understand where pollution is coming from than what they did 35 years ago — and those tools need to be updated.

McCabe said while states shouldn't be held responsible for pollution they can't control, it's important for the EPA to make sure wildfires are, in fact, the cause of that excess pollution.

""We're having more and more of these [wildfires]. If you have a couple a year, then it's not so hard. If you have dozens and dozens and dozens a year, then it they can build up and become a backlog and take a long time. And and so it's not crazy to say, let's look at that process and make sure it's as efficient as possible,"" she said.

McCabe said the issue of pollution crossing state lines into Indiana is nothing new. It's part of the reason why the Lake Michigan Air Directors Consortium exists — to help understand what causes air pollution in the region and discuss solutions.

""But you also need to pay attention to what the people who live in your state are exposed to day to day, and do your best to protect them from even more air pollution,"" she said.",https://www.wfyi.org/files/wfyi/articles/original/file_RG27MHJ0.jpg,N,,2025-10-15 17:09:13.524806

Every time you turn on a light switch, a complex system delivers electricity from power plants to your home. This system, the electric grid, includes the bulk power system (BPS) and the distribution system, and it works 24/7 to keep the lights on.

What is the bulk power system (BPS)?

The electric “grid” delivers electricity from producers to consumers. It includes the:

Generation system

Transmission system

Distribution system

The “Bulk Power System” (BPS) includes the generation and transmission systems. The North American Electricity Reliability Corporation (NERC) defines the BPS as “the facilities and control systems necessary for operating an interconnected electric energy transmission network (or any portion thereof); and electric energy from generation facilities needed to maintain transmission system reliability. The term does not include facilities used in the local distribution of electric energy”Footnote 1.

Maintaining the reliability of the BPS is crucial to ensuring the overall reliability of the electric grid.

Figure 1: Bulk Power System (BPS)

BPS reliability

Most Canadian provinces follow NERC’s reliability standards. Each province is responsible for maintaining the reliability of its BPS. NERC defines BPS reliability in terms of two parts:

AdequacyFootnote 2 means having enough resources to provide electricity at the proper voltage and frequency to continuously meet customer demand, virtually all the time. This is more generally referred to as resource adequacyFootnote 3 and is evaluated at the planning stage. In this planning stage, power system planners look ahead to predict how much electricity will be needed in the future, and make sure enough power plants and other resources will be available to meet that need, including some extra capacity for emergencies.

Operating reliabilityFootnote 4 refers to always keeping the power on—the ability of the electric system to withstand sudden and unexpected disturbances like short circuits or unplanned outagesFootnote 5. This is an issue that is managed in real time in the operational stage.

A reliable BPS is one that meets both these conditions, virtually all the time. An indicator of grid reliability difficulties is the Energy Emergency Alert (EEA). EEAs are alerts sent out by system operators during major grid events. These alerts are classified at different levels by NERC; level 3 being the most criticalFootnote 6, indicating the highest threat to grid reliability. Considering one of the provinces, Alberta for example, EEA events increased notably during 2022-2023, with four EEA 2 events and seven EEA 3 events in 2022. The trend continued into 2024 with six EEA-3 events, indicating sustained grid stress during this period.

Figure 2: Frequency of EEA 2 and EEA 3 events in Alberta since 2010

Managing unplanned outages

The reliability of the BPS can be impacted by unplanned outages, which can be caused by extreme weather conditions and create reliability issues if the power system isn’t flexible. Operators need to adjust quickly by redispatching other generators or by using operating reserves. Without adequate resources, the system may struggle to respond to unplanned outages, leading to potential reliability issues. Also, if there are no alternative transmission lines, or if the existing ones are congested, it can be even more challenging.

Recent extreme weather events surfaced these challenges across Canada. For example, in January 2024, Alberta narrowly avoided a rolling blackout during a severe cold weather event that also restricted electricity importsFootnote 7. With transmission lines from neighboring provinces congested and limited operating reserves available, the Alberta Electricity System Operator (AESO) took measures to maintain power supply, including asking residents to reduce their electricity usageFootnote 8. Later, in March 2025, a major ice storm left over a million customers without power in Ontario, with some outages lasting over a week due to extensive damage to transmission and distribution infrastructureFootnote 9. The widespread damage limited available transmission alternatives and overwhelmed system operators’ ability to redispatch resources.

How will future trends affect reliability?

Electricity demand is expected to increase significantly in the coming yearsFootnote 10. Trends driving increased demand include electricity’s projected role in decarbonization efforts, with growing electrification of end-uses (like increased electric vehicle use and heat pump adoption).Footnote 11 Further, new areas of demand growth, like data centers (ex. used to power AI) could also lead to increased growth in electricity demand.

Meeting this rising electricity demand could be a reliability challengeFootnote 12. Higher electricity consumption could make it difficult for grid operators to reliably provide sufficient power during peak periods.

To meet increased demand while keeping costs and emissions from electricity generation low, additional supply from clean energy sources is widely expected across energy forecasts. Even in scenarios that reflect current policies, many reports project substantial growth in variable renewable energy sources (VRES) like wind and solar, primarily due to their competitive costs.Footnote 13 Net-zero scenarios naturally show even greater VRES deployment. However, due to their intermittency, VRES must be managed carefully to maintain grid reliability.

Weather conditions also affect consumer electricity demand patterns. During extreme weather events, like heat waves or cold snaps, demand sometimes peaks while VRES output drops, leading to supply shortfallsFootnote 14. On the other hand, when weather conditions are ideal for VRES generation, output may be high while demand is low, resulting in supply surplusFootnote 15. This variability poses a challenge for the grid because, unlike conventional generators, solar and wind technologies lack the ability to adjust their output and are not easily dispatchable.

Ways to improve reliability

To ensure a reliable grid, the power system must continuously and safely operate during equipment outages, supply shortfalls, or surpluses. This requires a flexible grid, having the right mix of supply and transmission assets capable of responding to sudden changes in demand or unplanned outages.

One example of how grid reliability can be maintained is supply diversification by integrating VRES with dispatchable technologies such as battery storage and conventional power plants. Battery storage can store excess power during periods of surplus and provide power when needed, while other dispatchable technologies can provide base load capacity to complement VRESFootnote 16.

Increasing transmission capacity through new transmission lines or non-wire solutions (such as dynamic line rating) can facilitate power transfer from areas with surplus to those experiencing shortfalls. Demand management solutions, like enhanced demand response and the adoption of more energy-efficient devices, can also alleviate grid load.

Widespread grid modernization efforts could help improve reliability. This may include proposing new market structures, integrating new technologies like more accurate forecasting, advanced smart metering, grid automation and Internet of Things (IoT) technology, and energy storage systemsFootnote 17Footnote 18.

However, as grid modernization helps improve reliability, new vulnerabilities are also being introduced. These vulnerabilities involve physical and cyber threats and can be seen in smart grids, IoT sensors, and automated systems. To maintain reliability, modernized grids require safeguarding to manage and mitigate these new risks.

In the last year alone, Priority Hire workers earned $16 million in wages, plus benefits.
Residents and experienced construction workers from Seattle’s most racially diverse ZIP code 98118 uncovered a lack of local workers on City construction projects.
“We are honored to join Mayor Bruce Harrell, City leaders and staff as well as other community leaders to celebrate the tenth year of the City of Seattle’s impactful Priority Hire program.
“The past 10 years have shown that programs like Priority Hire can be transformative,” said District 4 Councilmember Maritza Rivera, who’s been a strong proponent of the Priority Hire program.","Seattle –Today, Mayor Bruce Harrell joined the Department of Finance and Administrative Services (FAS), union leaders, contractors, and training and community partners today to celebrate the 10-year impact of the City’s Priority Hire program.

Created in 2015 through a City Ordinance co-sponsored by then-Councilmember Harrell, the program is operated by FAS and establishes a community workforce agreement (CWA) among the City and labor partners. The CWA creates hiring goals that prioritize workers from economically distressed communities on City construction projects totaling $5 million or more.

“For over a decade, Seattle’s landmark Priority Hire program has opened doors for workers from historically underserved communities, connecting them with competitive paying construction and clean energy jobs,” said Mayor Harrell. “This program has served as a regional and national model for how we can invest in our communities and advance economic mobility, racial equity, and environmental justice goals. As we celebrate this milestone, we remain committed to building a city where everyone – regardless of their zip code or background – can access job opportunities and thrive.

Since its creation, construction workers who’ve gone through the program have earned $120 million dollars in wages—an amount that’s estimated to be double what they would have earned without Priority Hire. Many of these workers are BIPOC and women. In the last year alone, Priority Hire workers earned $16 million in wages, plus benefits.

“The Priority Hire program is helping ensure residents receive a fair share of wealth-generating construction jobs,” said FAS Director Kiersten Grove, whose department manages the program. “Thanks to the collective work of community, public-private partners, labor unions, contractors, and training partners, women and BIPOC workers have increased their share of hours worked on City projects by 60 percent since the program started, from 25 percent to 40 percent in 2024. And these jobs have a real and immediate impact on workers and their families.”

The program was created following the demolition and construction of the Rainier Beach Community Center. Residents and experienced construction workers from Seattle’s most racially diverse ZIP code 98118 uncovered a lack of local workers on City construction projects. They formed a coalition to increase access to work on large public works project and City leaders responded with the passage of the historic Priority Hire Ordinance in 2015. The ordinance was designed to expand economic opportunity and employment to racially diverse and economically disadvantaged Seattle area residents and, since its creation, has been a model throughout the region and nation that others have adopted.

“Priority Hire is one of those neighborhood derived policies that helps Seattle realize its promise as a city able to support the dreams and aspirations for all that come here, particularly those that settle in underinvested neighborhood,” said Gregory Davis, Managing Strategist at Rainier Beach Action Coalition.

The City estimates that apprentices on Priority Hire projects in 2024 earned about double the minimum wage of $19.97 an hour in Seattle, plus benefits. And workers who started as apprentices on the City’s earliest projects are now leaders in labor unions, contracting firms, and training programs — reshaping the industry from within.

“We are honored to join Mayor Bruce Harrell, City leaders and staff as well as other community leaders to celebrate the tenth year of the City of Seattle’s impactful Priority Hire program. Priority Hire fosters economic opportunity through careers in construction and pathways out of poverty for the most vulnerable through apprenticeship. The good, family-wage construction jobs for skilled craftspeople supported through this successful program are helping build better lives. We deeply value our partnership with the City of Seattle, and we are excited to keep strengthening and expanding the program,” said Monty Anderson, Executive Secretary, Seattle Building & Construction Trades Council.

As part of the program, Mayor Harrell issued a directive that recommits the City to the Priority Hire program and directs FAS to establish an interdepartmental team composed of representatives from all City departments that participate in or support private projects with significant City investment.

The City will build off of its success and investments in long-term worker success. Since 2016, the City has put $9.6 million toward construction outreach, training, and wraparound support – helping a thousand community members discover and access construction careers they might not have otherwise considered. In 2024, 30 percent of the City-funded pre-apprenticeship graduates who entered apprenticeship were women.

“The past 10 years have shown that programs like Priority Hire can be transformative,” said District 4 Councilmember Maritza Rivera, who’s been a strong proponent of the Priority Hire program. “As the daughter of a welder, I am proud to support this program that creates economic opportunities for people of color, women, and residents from economically troubled communities. This program is a national model for how to create long-term life-changing wages for Seattle communities.”

“What Seattle’s Priority Hire has meant to me personally is seeing hundreds of our Carpenter and other building trades pre-apprenticeship graduates step onto jobsites and into life-changing careers that support their families and futures,” said Marianna Hyke, Western States Regional Council of Carpenters and Priority Hire Advisory Committee Member. “It’s been incredible to witness how this program has brought education, pre-apprenticeship, apprenticeship programs, and contractors closer together, building real partnerships that strengthen our workforce. Most importantly, it has uplifted our local communities that are too often overlooked, helping small, minority, and women-owned businesses grow while transforming lives across our region.”",https://harrell.seattle.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/23/2025/10/DSC3137-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-15 17:08:40.338397

Earlier this month, the U.S. Department of Energy announced it was cancelling more than $7.5 billion in federal funding for clean energy projects across 16 states. That included cancelling 38 projects in Colorado.

Much of the clean energy funding came from the 2021 Infrastructure and Jobs Act and the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, two key legislative priorities of former President Joe Biden.

In an Oct. 14 letter to U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright, Sens. Michael Bennet and John Hickenlooper and Reps. Joe Neguse, Jason Crow, Brittany Pettersen and Diana DeGette said the cancellations “will result in the abandonment of cutting-edge research and private-sector investments, threatening Colorado jobs and energy affordability.”

The funding was designated for a wide range of projects across private industries, utilities, universities, state agencies and rural electric cooperatives, the lawmakers said. Those investments included university testing facilities, grid reliability improvements, rural cooperative load management, oil and gas infrastructure upgrades and dispatchable power for transitioning communities.

“We are concerned about the effect of these cancellations on Colorado’s workforce, economy, and energy costs,” the lawmakers wrote in their letter to Wright, a longtime oil and gas industry executive from Colorado.

“As a Colorado native, you know firsthand that families, farmers and businesses across our state depend on affordable, dependable energy to power their homes, grow their crops and sustain local economies,” their letter continued.

Lawmakers pressed Wright for “detailed responses” to a list of questions about the Department of Energy’s justification for cancelling projects in Colorado, including how many of the 38 projects had a signed legal contract in place.

They also asked Wright whether he had sought the input of longtime department staff or an external review when deciding what projects to cancel, whether the department had analyzed what the cancellations would mean for the economy, and information on how to appeal.

The Department of Energy, when it announced the cancellations, said entities would have 30 days to appeal the decision. Lawmakers asked what the criteria are for a project’s funding to be reinstated and how long it could take to renew that funding.

The funding cutoffs are part of a larger push by the Trump administration to overturn Biden-era climate policies that it has labelled “‘green’ corporate welfare.” Trump’s marquee domestic policy bill from this summer included a rollback of subsidies for electric vehicles and clean energy home upgrades, as well as an end to tax breaks for clean energy projects for the private sector.

Wright, in a statement earlier this month , framed the cancellation of $7.5 billion in projects as a way to save money for taxpayers. He said the funding had been “rushed through in the final months of the Biden administration with inadequate documentation by any reasonable business standard.”

“President Trump promised to protect taxpayer dollars and expand America’s supply of affordable, reliable and secure energy,” Wright said. “Rest assured, the Energy Department will continue reviewing awards to ensure that every dollar works for the American people.”

Along with the draft template, CARB also posted an explanatory memorandum.

This draft guidance from CARB is potentially helpful for reporting entities to understand what CARB will require in future reporting years, especially given that the legislative deadline for CARB to issue implementing regulations passed several months ago, as explained in our previous post. In recent months, CARB has been focused on presenting concepts for its regulations and identifying entities subject to reporting, as explained here.

The comment period will remain open until October 27, 2025. Interested parties can submit comments on the online docket or via email to climatedisclosure@arb.ca.gov.

Overview of the Climate Corporate Data Accountability Act

SB 253 is aimed at creating transparency for the public regarding reporting of GHG emissions for certain larger businesses. To that end, it requires “reporting entities” to disclose their GHG emissions in a format accessible to the public. Reporting entities are broadly defined as entities with an annual revenue exceeding $1 billion that “do business in California.” Inaugural reporting of Scope 1 and 2 emissions starts next year, despite the fact that CARB is still working on implementing regulations to clarify requirements. CARB is expected to set the exact reporting deadline in these upcoming regulations.

The New Draft Template

The explanatory memorandum states that CARB intends for the draft template to “streamline reporting, especially for entities disclosing GHG emissions for the very first time.”[1] Use of the template is, however, voluntary for the 2026 reporting cycle.

The draft template lists 74 mandatory fields and 100 optional fields for future reporting years. It contains fields for expected types of information, like general organization identification information and contact information. It also includes several technical questions tied to the emission disclosures requirements of SB 253, necessitating extensive data collection and verifiable calculations to answer. The questions are categorized, and the data type (i.e., text or numeric) is identified. The table organizes Scope 1 emissions disclosures by mobile, stationary, or fugitive sources.

One of the key issues related to SB 253 is how an organization is defined for reporting purposes – i.e., where to draw the line around the entity that is reporting the information. The template asks questions on how the entity defines its organizational boundaries, leaving entities with a choice of which approach to use, of those provided for under the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (i.e., equity share, financial control, or operational control approach). The template also asks questions about the entity’s emission reductions associated with use of renewable electricity or renewable gas. The majority of the optional questions are variations of the mandatory emissions questions but focused on a specific greenhouse gas. There is also an optional question allowing the entity to explain any limitations or uncertainties in the report.

Again, use of the template for reporting in 2026 is voluntary. CARB noted that it will publish further guidance on reporting as part of the regulatory process",https://www.hunton.com/the-nickel-report/assets/images-t1760560271/201213.png,N,,2025-10-15 17:09:27.977961

CICIL’s business model poses a bigger question: Could sustainability be the future of North Carolina textiles?","DURHAM, N.C. – For decades, North Carolina’s textile industry has been in freefall. Since the 1990s, the state has lost more than 80% of its textile jobs, leaving behind shuttered mills and fading traditions, according to the North Carolina Department of Commerce.

But a handful of small companies and researchers believe the industry could be on the cusp of a new chapter–one focused less on mass production and more on sustainability, transparency and regional supply chains.

The question is whether such an approach can scale and whether consumers are willing to support it.

A changing industry

Textiles were once synonymous with North Carolina manufacturing. The state’s textile mills powered the state’s economy for more than a century, employing generations of families and anchoring small-town life.

At the sector’s peak in the mid-20th century, North Carolina produced more than 40% of U.S. textiles. But when companies began chasing cheaper labor overseas in the late 20th century, that dominance unraveled with globalization.

Between 1993 and 2022, employment in North Carolina’s textile industry fell by 85%, according to the Department of Commerce. In 1996, more than 2,100 plants employed over 230,000 workers. By 2006, employment dropped to about 80,000.

“North Carolina was built on textiles. But in the 1990s and 2000s, jobs moved overseas and the industry hollowed out,” said Dr. Kativa Mathur, a professor at N.C. State University’s Wilson College of Textiles. “What we’re seeing now is not the end of textiles, just something new.”

What remains is a smaller, more specialized sector. Mills that once churned out low-cost apparel fabrics now focus on industrial materials, performance fabrics and, increasingly, sustainable products.

The push for sustainability

Beyond economics, environmental stakes loom large. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimates textiles accounted for 17 million tons of municipal solid waste in 2018, with a recycling rate under 15%.

The shift towards sustainable business reflects broader consumer and environmental pressures. Globally, textiles are responsible for an estimated 6% to 8% of greenhouse gas emissions, according to a 2023 study published in Frontiers in Environmental Science. Synthetic fibers, which make up about two-thirds of clothing worldwide, shed microplastics that pollute waterways and contribute to long-term waste.

That has spurred interest in natural fibers like cotton and wool, as well as more transparent supply chains. North Carolina is uniquely positioned to meet these demands: The state is home to one of the world’s leading textile research hubs, a skilled labor force and a heritage of craftsmanship that startup companies are eager to tap into.

State officials have also pointed to textiles as an area for innovation. Initiatives like the Manufacturing Solutions Center in Conover, North Carolina, are supporting startups and manufacturers experimenting with new materials and business models.

CICIL, a Durham-based rug startup, is one of the several companies trying to test that model.

Its founders, Caroline Cockerham and Laura Tripp, say building their brand around sourcing directly from East Coast farms and manufacturing in North Carolina is designed to break from the very practices that unraveled the industry in the first place.

“We like to say we’re textile nerds,” said Cockerham, who studied at NC State’s College of Textiles before working with Tripp as material developers at a California-based clothing company. “We saw firsthand how global supply chains were broken. There was slave labor in cotton, false claims about organic sourcing and products being made in places the brand didn’t even know about. It was backwards.”

Frustrated by that opacity, the pair founded CICIL in 2021 with a simple mission: rebuild a transparent, regional textile supply chain. Instead of outsourcing production, they turned to East Coast farms and a third-generation mill in North Carolina, creating toxin-free rugs that travel fewer than 1,000 miles from sheep to showroom.

“We said, ‘We have these beautiful heritage textiles in our backyard. Why aren’t we using them?’” Cockerham said. “We built the supply chain first, then created the product that worked for it.”

Farmers find opportunity

For small and mid-sized wool farms, which often struggle to compete against global commodity prices, companies like CICIL provide rare stability.

“My partner and I started with 4-H animals when we were kids, and we just never gave it up,” said Siri Swanson, a Vermont farmer and sheep shearer who supplies to CICIL. “Shearing became our launching pad into farming full-time, but selling wool is tough. It’s too small for the commodity market, too big for just farmers’ markets. CICIL stepped in and gave us an outlet.”

Swanson said the partnership not only sustains her farm but also offers a model for others.

Unlike traditional textile companies, which often externalize environmental costs and rely on opaque supply chains, CICIL builds sustainability into each decision, Cockerham said. The company pays fair prices for wool that might otherwise be discarded and ensures production remains regional, prioritizing accountability.

CICIL’s rugs avoid synthetics, dyes and harsh chemicals. The natural fibers not only make them biodegradable but also highlight the unique colors of wool sourced from small farms.

Can it scale?

CICIL’s business model poses a bigger question: Could sustainability be the future of North Carolina textiles?

Mathur said the industry is at a crossroads. “The challenge is that sustainable textiles cost more. Consumers say they want them, but not everyone is willing to pay a premium,” she said.

According to the National Retail Federation, over 53% of U.S. consumers think sustainable products cost too much.

Although a PwC’s 2024 Voice of the Consumer Survey cites, “while the cost-of-living pressures weigh, some consumers say they are willing to pay 9.7% more, on average, for sustainably produced or sourced goods.”

A wool rug from CICIL starts at several hundred dollars, far more than synthetic alternatives available at big-box stores.

Mathur also cautioned that small startups alone cannot revive an entire industry. “To scale, we need investment in infrastructure, modernized mills and strong consumer demand,” she said.

The type of consumer who supports companies like CICIL are fond of the quality and uniqueness of the products. “I love anything different and alternative and I discovered CICIL on a Google search,” said Pam Parker, a South Carolina resident and a frequent consumer of CICIL.

“I’ve purchased three rugs and I love their fabrics. Their products are different, excellent quality and they have fabulous customer service,” Parker said.

The stakes

Advocates say natural fibers and regional supply chains could reduce the industry’s footprint, though scaling up remains difficult. The United States produced less than 1% of the world’s wool in 2020, according to the nonprofit Textile Exchange, and sustainable production often requires higher upfront costs.

For CICIL, the mission is about more than rugs.

“Companies like CICIL are a huge light forward for us,” said Swanson, who supplies for over 200 brands. “They are willing to work with our constraints. It is the type of wool we can actually grow here, in this climate. That gives us hope. It shows there’s a path between these tiny operations and the massive community farms.”",https://i0.wp.com/mediahub.unc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/CICIL-200x200.jpg,N,,2025-10-15 21:05:32.784442

Building the Power Backbone for AI

Brookfield and Bloom Energy have announced a $5 billion strategic partnership to build and power the next generation of “AI factories,” combining infrastructure investment with on-site clean power systems to address the surging energy demand driven by artificial intelligence.

The deal marks Brookfield’s first investment under its new AI Infrastructure strategy, which focuses on large-scale facilities designed to integrate compute, power, and capital from inception. Bloom Energy, known for its solid oxide fuel cell systems, will become the preferred onsite power provider for Brookfield’s global AI factory developments.

“AI infrastructure must be built like a factory—with purpose, speed, and scale,” said KR Sridhar, Founder, Chairman and CEO of Bloom Energy. “The lean AI factory is achieved when power, infrastructure, and compute are designed in sync from day one.”

A Grid-Independent Model for AI Expansion

Unlike conventional data centers dependent on legacy grids, AI factories envisioned by the partnership will use behind-the-meter power—energy generated and consumed on-site. This approach offers resilience against grid congestion and instability, which are emerging as critical risks as AI power demand accelerates.

“Behind-the-meter power solutions are essential to closing the grid gap for AI factories,” said Sikander Rashid, Global Head of AI Infrastructure at Brookfield. “Bloom’s fuel cell technology gives us the capability to design and construct modern AI factories with a holistic and innovative approach to power needs.”

Bloom’s fuel cells can generate continuous, dispatchable electricity directly on-site using natural gas, biogas, or hydrogen. Unlike intermittent renewables, fuel cells can provide consistent baseload power with near-zero particulate emissions. This flexibility is increasingly attractive to hyperscale developers and institutional investors navigating regulatory and physical grid bottlenecks.

The first joint AI factory site will be located in Europe, with an announcement expected before year-end.

The Coming Surge in AI Power Demand

AI’s power intensity is quickly redefining data infrastructure. Analysts estimate that AI data centers in the United States alone could exceed 100 gigawatts of power demand by 2035, roughly equivalent to the entire consumption of California today.

That scale of growth has spurred interest in modular, off-grid power solutions capable of being deployed quickly and replicated globally. Bloom Energy’s systems—already operating at facilities run by American Electric Power, Equinix, and Oracle—demonstrate the technology’s viability at industrial scale.

By combining Bloom’s engineering expertise with Brookfield’s project-finance capabilities, the partnership aims to create a repeatable AI factory model that can be adapted to different regional energy markets, policy environments, and fuel sources.

Brookfield’s Growing Digital and Energy Portfolio

Brookfield, with over $550 billion in critical infrastructure assets, has rapidly expanded its exposure to the digital and clean energy sectors. Recent deals include stakes in Compass Datacenters, Duke Energy Florida, and Hotwire Communications, as well as a multi-gigawatt agreement to supply Google with hydropower across the United States.

The AI Infrastructure strategy builds on more than $100 billion Brookfield has invested in digital assets globally, including data centers, fiber networks, and renewable energy. The company sees AI-driven infrastructure as the next convergence point between its energy and digital portfolios.

“Power has become the defining constraint—and opportunity—in the AI era,” said a senior Brookfield executive familiar with the strategy. “Owning and integrating both sides of the equation will determine who scales fastest.”

Global Implications

The Brookfield–Bloom partnership is emerging as a test case for how institutional capital, clean technology, and energy system design can evolve to meet AI’s exponential load growth. As governments tighten net-zero mandates and grid upgrades lag behind, decentralized clean power generation is likely to become a defining theme in global data infrastructure financing.

For C-suite leaders and investors, the partnership signals a structural realignment of how digital infrastructure is financed and powered—where energy autonomy, emissions compliance, and capital efficiency converge to shape the next wave of AI investment.

Administration strips $1 billion for PacNW Hydrogen Hub, risking thousands of jobs and huge regional effort to reduce carbon pollution

WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA), senior member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee and ranking member of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, joined Senate colleagues to demand the Trump administration restore funding for 223 energy projects in Democratic-led states that were unlawfully canceled even though Congress had approved and appropriated funding for them.

“We write in strong opposition to the Trump administration unlawfully cancelling $8 billion in federal investments in 223 energy projects,” the senators wrote to U.S. Department of Energy Secretary Chris Wright and the U.S. Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought. “For the 21 states with impacted projects, your cancellations will mean thousands of lost jobs for Americans, many of whom had every reason to rely on the stability of their jobs before these cancellations and all of whom will face uncertain job markets in our increasingly slowing economy.”

“218 out of 223 projects that were terminated are in states with Democratic leadership. Even in programs where awards were made across all 50 states, such as the Grid Resilience and Innovation Partnerships program, only projects in Democratically led states were cancelled—while similar projects in ‘red states’ remain,” the senators continued.

“These are impacts that will be felt by Americans, regardless of their political views,” the senators concluded. “For the good of our country, the rule of law, and the American people, we demand that you change course and restore the previously awarded funding.”

Earlier this month Sen. Cantwell criticized the Administration’s decision to target the Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Association (PNWH2) as part of the cuts. The PNWH2 supports clean energy efforts in Washington, Idaho, Montana, and Oregon.

“The Trump Administration’s politically motivated decision to strip funds from the pioneering Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Hub is unprecedented and corrupt. Our region was awarded this Hub following an intensive national competition because we showed we had the pioneering researchers, clean energy resources, and over $5 billion in committed local investment that it would take to show that clean hydrogen can work. I will be fighting to restore these funds,” Sen. Cantwell following the administration’s Oct. 1 announcement.

The letter was led by U.S. Senators Martin Heinrich (D-NM), ranking member of the U.S. Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee and Patty Murray (D-WA), vice chair of the U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee.

The massive investment will expand domestic production by 50%, including five new vehicle launches, and add more than 5,000 jobs across factories in Illinois, Indiana, Michigan and Ohio, Stellantis stated.

“This investment in the US – the single largest in the company’s history – will drive our growth, strengthen our manufacturing footprint and bring more American jobs to the states we call home,” Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa said in a Wednesday statement.

“Accelerating growth in the US has been a top priority since my first day,” added Filosa, who took the helm in June and has been eager to boost sales after his predecessor, Carlos Tavares, focused on profits over volumes.

Trump has been pushing US auto giants to ramp up their domestic manufacturing efforts. His tariffs – including a 25% levy on imported car parts and a 50% tariff on foreign steel and aluminum – have squeezed supply chains across the industry.

In June, Stellantis said the tariffs cost the company nearly $350 million in the first half of 2025 as it was forced to pause production at some plants and cut back on shipments of imported vehicles.

Shares in Stellantis – which owns brands like Jeep, Ram and Dodge – jumped 2.3% Wednesday. The stock is down about 20% so far this year.

More than $600 million of the new investment will go toward reopening a plant in Belvidere, Ill., where the production of a new Jeep Cherokee and Jeep Compass will create 3,300 new jobs by 2027, the automaker stated.

A new mid-size truck will be assembled at the company’s Toledo, Ohio, plant thanks to a $400 million investment, the company said. That is expected to create 900 new jobs by 2028.

Nearly $100 million will back the production of a new electric vehicle and large SUV at a Warren, Mich., plant in 2028, which will support 900 new jobs, according to Stellantis.

It said about $130 million will also go to the Detroit plant, where the next-generation Dodge Durango will be manufactured by 2029.

New four-cylinder engines will be produced at the company’s facilities in Kokomo, Ind., starting in 2026 — thanks to a $100 million investment — the company said. The new engines will create more than 100 new jobs, it added.

While boosting spending in the US, Stellantis scrapped plans to reopen a Canadian plant that previously employed roughly 3,000 workers.

The company said its four-year investment plan builds on promises to expand US manufacturing that its chairman, John Elkann, made when Trump took office in January and started pushing big firms to reshore their operations.

If built, Commonwealth LNG would permanently destroy over 75 acres of wetlands in the Calcesieu Pass area, and alter hundreds more, adding to the already staggering permanent alteration of over 500 acres of wetlands approved for just two of the neighboring coastal LNG projects.

I am relieved that the Judge upheld our concerns with Commonwealth LNG, and that LDENR failed the people of Cameron Parish.","CAMERON PARISH, LA – A Louisiana state court terminated the coastal use permit for the proposed Commonwealth LNG export facility, finding state officials violated the Louisiana Constitution by failing to consider the environmental impacts on the surrounding communities of color and low-income communities.

“We are heartened by the court’s ruling that LDENR’s refusal to consider the environmental justice impacts of the project violated the Louisiana Constitution. It is past time for LDENR to account for the true costs of its permits on Louisiana’s coastline and communities in terms of loss of wetlands and storm buffers,” said Eric Huber, Managing Attorney at Sierra Club. “This is another in a series of permits by LDNR for the LNG build-out on the Gulf, including the permit for CP2 directly across Calcasieu Pass. We urge LDENR to stop its pro-forma permitting and carry out its mission to protect the public health and welfare of all Louisianans.”

The court found that the Louisiana Department of Energy and Natural Resources (LDENR) violated the Louisiana Constitution by issuing the Coastal Use Permit for the proposed Commonwealth LNG export facility without considering its disproportionate effect on the surrounding communities of color and low-income communities, alongside the climate change impacts and cumulative impacts with other export facilities already in the area.

If built, Commonwealth LNG would permanently destroy over 75 acres of wetlands in the Calcesieu Pass area, and alter hundreds more, adding to the already staggering permanent alteration of over 500 acres of wetlands approved for just two of the neighboring coastal LNG projects. The liquefied methane gas, known as LNG, it would export would have annual greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to 14 coal-fired power plants or 13 million new gasoline powered vehicles.

“This is an area of the Louisiana coastline that is being devastated by LNG facilities,” said Joanie Steinhaus, Ocean Program Director for Turtle Island Restoration Network. “These agencies have long ignored the cumulative impact to air and water quality and the health of the local community members and the environment”

This is not the first court ruling against Commonwealth LNG. In July, 2024, a three judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit rejected the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s (FERC) authorization for this same project. The Court ruled FERC failed to adequately assess the cumulative and direct environmental and health impacts that would be caused by air pollution from the facility. This caused FERC to revise its air pollution analysis and, on Sept. 18, 2025, FERC finally gave the facility the go-ahead to begin site preparation for construction. The Cameron Parish court’s decision however vacated the state coastal use permit, which should effectively stop the project’s construction unless and until a new lawful permit is issued that complies with the Louisiana Constitution.

“Like the rest of the gas export industry, Commonwealth would be a polluting disaster that would destroy fragile fishing areas and further decimate fishing families in southwest Louisiana. It should never have been permitted. We hope this ruling shakes Louisiana to its senses,” said Anne Rolfes, director of Louisiana Bucket Brigade. “On one side are out of state profiteers who export our natural resources and pollute us in the process. On the other are Louisiana families who want to be able to live here and catch and eat our seafood. Commonwealth would destroy our coast and our culture. It would make us more vulnerable to storms. The coastal use permit needs to be revoked.”

There are already six LNG export terminals proposed, approved, under construction, or operating in the area—including Venture Global’s Calcesieu Pass and CP2 facilities. These facilities contribute to the loss of hundreds of acres of wetland and habitat for sensitive species, increased flooding, loss of buffer areas from storms, air and water pollution, and increased risks of catastrophic industrial accidents.

“As a long-term landowner in Cameron Parish who lives adjacent to the Commonwealth LNG site and one mile from Venture Global’s Calcasieu Pass LNG, I see the effects of LNG export terminals every day— the frequent flaring, the noise and light pollution, and destruction of our wetlands and fisheries,” said John Allaire, a resident of Cameron Parish. “It’s a massive burden and destroying our community. I am relieved that the Judge upheld our concerns with Commonwealth LNG, and that LDENR failed the people of Cameron Parish. My hat is off to the local district court for this unbiased decision to hopefully protect the citizens and save a piece of God’s country in Cameron Parish.”

“This ruling is a victory for the people and the wetlands of Southwest Louisiana,” said James Hiatt, Director of For a Better Bayou. “It shows that when our government fails to protect our coast from reckless industrial expansion, the courts can still uphold the law. For too long, communities like ours have carried the burden of pollution, flooding, and destruction while corporations profit. This decision is a reminder that our coast is not a sacrifice zone—it’s our home, and it deserves protection.”",https://i0.wp.com/seaturtles.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/82000.png?fit=1640%2C924&ssl=1,N,,2025-10-15 17:10:24.679455

(AP) — Federal officials rejected a company's bid to acquire 167 million tons of coal on public lands in Montana for less than a penny per ton, in what would have been the biggest U.S. government coal sale in more than a decade.

The failed sale underscores a continued low appetite for coal among utilities that are turning to cheaper natural gas and renewables such as wind and solar to generate electricity. Emissions from burning coal are a leading driver of climate change, which scientists say is raising sea levels and making weather more extreme.

President Donald Trump has made reviving the coal industry a centerpiece of his agenda to increase U.S. energy production. But economists say Trump's attempts to boost coal are unlikely to reverse its yearslong decline.

The Department of Interior said in a Tuesday statement that last week's $186,000 bid from the Navajo Transitional Energy Co. (NTEC) did not meet the requirements of the Mineral Leasing Act.

Agency representatives did not provide further details, and it's unclear if they will attempt to hold the sale again.

The leasing act requires bids to be at or above fair market value. At the last successful government lease sale in the region, a subsidiary of Peabody Energy paid $793 million, or $1.10 per ton, for 721 million tons of coal in Wyoming.

President Joe Biden's administration sought to end coal sales in the Powder River Basin of Montana and Wyoming, citing climate change.

A second proposed lease sale under Trump — 440 million tons of coal near an NTEC mine in central Wyoming — was postponed last week following the low bid received in the Montana sale. Interior Department officials have not said when the Wyoming sale will be rescheduled.

NTEC is owned by the Navajo Nation of Arizona, New Mexico and Utah.

In documents submitted in the run-up to the Montana sale, NTEC indicated the coal had little value because of declining demand for the fuel. The Associated Press emailed a company representative regarding the rejected bid.

Most power plants using fuel from NTEC's Spring Creek mine in Montana and Antelope mine in Wyoming are scheduled to stop burning coal in the next decade, according to an analysis by The Associated Press.

Spring Creek also ships coal overseas to customers in Asia. Increasing those shipments could help it offset lessening domestic demand, but a shortage of port capacity has hobbled prior industry aspirations to boost coal exports.",https://wehco.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/img/photos/2025/10/15/AP25276571856086_t1200.jpg?57a0c2296240c280e9492005c3cad63e7cbe80f4,N,,2025-10-15 16:09:49.107371

Basically, Fields noted, Ford—and most every other United States automaker—overestimated the size of the EV market and started ramping up production before they really had the market to justify it. Fields explained, “Over the last couple of years, the automakers really went full bore in putting in capacity for EVs. They really didn’t have a good discussion on the consumer, in terms of what it was going to take to get the consumer to buy these EV products.”

This echoes the sentiment from Farley, who declared that the EV market was “…way smaller than we thought,” especially once the electric vehicle tax credits were slated for removal.

Price Cuts

But Ford is not planning to go down without a fight. Ford is launching a cost-cutting plan on its F-150 Lightning electric pickup line, and is also augmenting it with some improvements in overall range. With Ford grappling with rival Tesla (TSLA) for the top-seller slot in electric pickups, such a move may help Ford cement its newly-recovered crown.

Ford is paring back costs on the Lightning by as much as $4,000, reports note, and the STX now offers an extra 50 miles of driving range. These may be rather minor improvements, but minor improvements may be enough to sway fence-sitters and turn them into buyers, a definite plus for Ford.

Is Ford Stock a Good Buy Right Now?

Turning to Wall Street, analysts have a Hold consensus rating on F stock based on two Buys, 10 Holds and two Sells assigned in the past three months, as indicated by the graphic below. After a 5.62% rally in its share price over the past year, the average F price target of $11.41 per share implies 2.93% downside risk.

The company said its decision was motivated by better market opportunities in Texas, rather than an unfavorable business environment in California.
GAF Energy, which is owned by Standard Industries, opened a manufacturing facility in Texas last year.
The consolidation to a Texas headquarters will help the company “drive efficiencies, foster stronger collaboration and partnership amongst teams, and better serve customers,” the spokesperson said.
GAF Energy did not point to faults in California’s business environment as a reason for moving operations to Texas.","A San José-based tech company that sells roof shingles with built-in solar panels is the latest to announce plans to leave the Golden State for Texas.

GAF Energy will relocate its headquarters to Georgetown, Texas, on Dec. 13, the company announced in a notification document filed with state officials. The company said its decision was motivated by better market opportunities in Texas, rather than an unfavorable business environment in California.

The company will lay off 138 California-based employees, including technicians, engineers and managers.

The San José headquarters, which is currently used for research, development and solar panel manufacturing, was opened in 2021. Both in-person and remote employees will be affected by its closure, the notice said.

Required by the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, or WARN, the notice must be issued by a company 60 days before a mass layoff.

GAF Energy, which is owned by Standard Industries, opened a manufacturing facility in Texas last year. The company plans to consolidate its operations at a new headquarters in the state, President Martin DeBono said.

“In light of ongoing changes in the solar industry, we are aligning our business and our team to focus on key markets where solar is most compelling for builders and homeowners,” a company spokesperson said in a statement. “This decision was not taken lightly. We are grateful to our employees in San Jose for their contributions to the business and are committed to assisting those impacted through this transition.”

GAF Energy advertises a more practical approach to rooftop solar energy by embedding solar panels directly into shingles, rather than installing them on top of a roof.

The consolidation to a Texas headquarters will help the company “drive efficiencies, foster stronger collaboration and partnership amongst teams, and better serve customers,” the spokesperson said.

Though Silicon Valley is known as a premier tech hub and incubator for young companies, many firms have left the state in recent years, complaining of strict regulations, high taxes and costly labor.

Tesla moved its headquarters out of Palo Alto in 2021, the same year that financial services firm Charles Schwab relocated from San Francisco to North Texas. Elon Musk moved the head offices of his other companies — SpaceX and X — to Texas last year, as did Chevron, the oil giant that was started in California.

Bed Bath & Beyond’s chief executive Marcus Lemonis recently took aim at California and announced that the company would not reopen stores in the state, writing on X that “California has created one of the most overregulated, expensive, and risky environments for businesses.”

Economists said the state remains the fourth-largest economy in the world, boasts a diverse pool of talent and is a hub of technological innovation.

The projects funded will replace lead service lines, rehabilitate aging systems, upgrade treatment and service capabilities, and reduce environmental contaminants to ensure Pennsylvanians have access to clean, safe water.

“Every Pennsylvanian has a constitutional right to clean air and pure water — and my Administration is investing historic resources to make sure that right is protected all across our Commonwealth,” said Governor Josh Shapiro. “PENNVEST project help communities modernize their water systems, protect public health, and create jobs — and working together across party lines and all levels of government, we’re getting stuff done, delivering results for the good people of Pennsylvania, and building a stronger, more resilient future.”

“In just the past five years, PENNVEST has seen an 83 percent increase in demand for water infrastructure funding — a clear sign of the need for continued investment across Pennsylvania,” said Robert Boos, Executive Director of PENNVEST. “Our revolving loan model ensures these projects are sustainable for the long term — as loans are repaid, those funds are recycled to support future projects. Thanks to this structure, PENNVEST has been able to fully fund every eligible, shovel-ready application since 2015.”

With the national focus on strengthening infrastructure through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL), PENNVEST has more capacity than ever to provide cost-effective financing for critical water quality projects. PENNVEST continues to adapt and expand opportunities for communities to upgrade their systems and incorporate clean energy solutions — such as solar, anaerobic digesters, and hydropower — that reduce long-term operating costs and qualify for Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) tax incentives.

PENNVEST funding for these projects originates from a combination of state funds approved by voters, Growing Greener funds, Marcellus Legacy funds, the Infrastructure Investment & Jobs Act (IIJA), federal grants from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency under the Clean Water Act and Safe Drinking Water Act, and recycled loan repayments from previous PENNVEST awards.

Cambria County

***Highland Sewer and Water Authority – received a $6,619,251 grant and a $1,897,419 loan for improvements to the Croyle Township Water Authority (CTWA) system, which will be absorbed by the Highland Sewer and Water Authority (HSWA) upon completion of the system upgrade. The project consists of the installation of three (3) water storage tanks and three (3) pump stations, as well as all appurtenances and site work necessary to complete these installations and connection to the waterline that will be installed under the scope of work planned for two future PENNVEST applications supporting additional upgrades. The new tank installations will be located at Falcon Field, Swigle Mountain, and New Germany. The Falcon Field and Swigle Mountain sites will be developed for new tank installation. The existing New Germany tank will be dismantled and returned to HSWA for future use. A new chlorine and telecommunications building will be constructed on the New Germany tank site to allow for additional chlorination and integration of the CTWA system with HSWA’s existing communication network. A new pump station will be constructed to replace the existing Flennertown pump station; the existing Jackson Street pump station will be replaced with a new Pine Street pump station; and the New Germany pump station will be constructed at the Swigle Mountain tank site. The additional tanks and pump stations will improve water pressure conditions, longevity, and serviceability of the system.

*Jackson Township Water Authority – received a $4,477,000 loan for upgrades at the George Wyse and Whitetail Road pump stations and at the Mile Hill storage tank. Rehabilitation to the pump stations include replacing existing pumps with higher capacity pumps, and upgrading the controls, variable frequency drives (VFDs), and interior piping. Approximately 5,000 feet of 8-inch polyvinyl chloride (PVC) waterline will be installed between the George Wyse pump station and State Route 22 to replace the existing 6-inch waterline; and 25 customers currently connected to this mainline will be upgraded to a new 0.75-inch pipe. Additionally, the Mile Hill storage tank will be raised from 29 feet to 89 feet tall, involving a 13-ring expansion to increase the storage capacity to 488,000 gallons. This project will increase water storage capabilities and water pressure which will provide better fire protection.

Clinton County

*City of Lock Haven – received an $8,800,000 loan to develop a supplemental water source to bolster the City’s reservoir serving 2,897 households within 4 municipalities. The project includes the development of two groundwater wells, Matz and Quaker Hill, that will be connected to the Central Clinton County Water Filtration Authority’s water treatment plant. A well operation building will be constructed, including an emergency generator and all necessary electrical components and controls. A new well transmission line will also be constructed to interconnect to the Central Clinton County Water Filtration Authority’s water treatment plant with all required internal plant pipe connections and chemical feed injection points. A meter pressure control and monitoring facility will be installed to regulate downstream system pressure and meter water flow to the service area. This project will ensure robust and reliable delivery of water.

Columbia County

***Pennsylvania American Water Company – received a $1,087,628 grant and a $24,362,372 loan for Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) remediation and treatment at the Berwick water treatment plant serving 6,721 households within 5 municipalities throughout Columbia and Luzerne Counties. A new treatment plant will be constructed adjacent to the existing plant and will include a buried clear well, wet well, and granular-activated carbon (GAC) pressure filters designed for the removal of PFAS substances. Equipment installation will include disinfection and corrosion control systems, a sodium hypochlorite disinfection system to replace the existing chlorine gas system, new pipeline to transfer raw water from the existing four (4) wells to the new treatment plant, and new finished water transmission main to convey finished water from the new treatment plant to the existing 20-inch distribution system. Completion of this project will extend the life of the system and ensure compliance with new regulations for PFAS.

Delaware County

***Aqua Pennsylvania, Inc. – received a $3,900,704 grant and a $31,099,296 loan to minimize the presence of Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in finished water via treatment at the existing Ridley water treatment plant serving 15,760 residents in Media. The PFAS treatment involves the usage of granular-activated carbon (GAC) in trains of dual vessels to adsorb the PFAS compounds. The vessels will be housed in a new brick building and include a new electrical room for pump starters and variable frequency drives. The project also includes a low lift pump station with four (4) vertical turbine pumps to push water through the treatment vessels, and a 100,000-gallon waste equalization tank with two submersible transfer pumps to facilitate media rinses and backwashes. The project will address health and safety concerns associated with Perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) and Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) contamination.

Erie County

***Erie City Water Authority – received a $9,629,116 grant and a $370,884 loan for Phase 4 of a lead service line replacement project within the City of Erie. The Authority will replace approximately 1,000 service connections consisting of galvanized pipe formerly attached to, and located downstream of, water mains containing lead goosenecks and other lead components. The Authority previously removed lead components from the public side of the service line over the prior decades in advance of street paving projects or routine leak repairs. This project will support the replacement of the remaining portion of downstream private-side service lines. Removal of all galvanized and leaded water service lines will directly improve the water quality for the system’s customers and is consistent with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PADEP) initiatives to remove lead-containing lines from the public water supply.

Fayette County

*Borough of Masontown – received a $975,223 grant and a $3,523,749 loan for a water meter relocation project.

,North Carolina and Evs,2025-10-15 19:24:38+00:00,FleetOwner,Ford Pro and Southern Company demonstrate dynamic pricing and fleet charging ... - FleetOwner,Jade Brasher,,,,,https://www.fleetowner.com/emissions-efficiency/article/55323503/ford-pro-and-southern-company-demonstrate-dynamic-pricing-and-fleet-charging-management-without-impacting-vehicle-uptime,"Ford Pro recently teamed up with Southern Company to help answer some of these electrification questions, especially the fleet-focused ones.
The pilot program sought to answer questions surrounding fleet vehicle charge management at multiple Southern Company locations while charging Ford EVs.
The pilot took place over six months using Southern Company’s own Ford Lightning electric pickup trucks (about 200 of them) and Ford Pro chargers.
Through this pilot, Ford Pro and Southern Company found that these vehicles were sufficiently charged and ready for work even with the staggered charging.
While the pilot with Southern Company was particular to Southern Company’s fleet, Gupta believes the information gathered and data received from the pilot can help other fleets.","There’s no denying that utility companies stand to benefit from the electrification of the automobile and trucking industries. But because electrification is still a relatively new concept—considering the lack of infrastructure, less experience owning electric vehicles (EVs), and more—there are still aspects of widespread electrification that require more research and a little trial and error.

Ford Pro recently teamed up with Southern Company to help answer some of these electrification questions, especially the fleet-focused ones. This Atlanta-based utility company provides electricity to customers in Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi.

The pilot program sought to answer questions surrounding fleet vehicle charge management at multiple Southern Company locations while charging Ford EVs.

“The focus of this pilot was two key levers: to reduce technical and commercial barriers to widespread EV adoption while also adding benefits to the grid,” Ford Pro Product Manager Ananya Gupta told FleetOwner. “It was twofold: How does the grid benefit from this, and how do our customers and commercial customers take advantage of the products and services available to them?”

To accomplish this task, Southern Company and Ford Pro reviewed whether EVs can be used as a “demand response resource” and how to optimize charging through dynamic pricing.

The pilot took place over six months using Southern Company’s own Ford Lightning electric pickup trucks (about 200 of them) and Ford Pro chargers.

Optimizing fleet EV operations through dynamic and smart charging technology

Managing peak grid demand with demand response and staggered EV charging

Ford Pro and Southern Company’s pilot also sought to test the effectiveness of pausing vehicle charging at times when the grid was strained.

Gupta explained that each time these vehicles charge, they consume energy from the grid. If these EVs all charge at scale, that energy puts significant strain on the grid. The Ford Pro team sought to mitigate this strain proactively, Gupta said.

Using technology similar to dynamic charging, which allows the vehicle to accept charge at specific times, demand response can prevent the vehicle from pulling charge when excessive stress is placed on the grid.

“We can take a signal from the grid and say, ‘OK, can you stop charging for a certain time on these assets so that energy can be used somewhere else?’” Gupta said.

While this likely won’t affect your average commercial fleet, managing charging in this way benefits Southern Company by ensuring the electricity it provides is used for essential services across its network, not for its own fleet vehicles.

Using Southern Company’s expertise, the two parties determined the best times to test demand response charging. They tested this at three different times of the day when Southern Company indicated a high demand on grid activity (think: peak times).

Ford Pro then planned for these events within its charging platform, enabling the chargers to receive signals from the grid and ensuring the charging pause and charging restart would happen seamlessly with no human intervention. The pilot proved successful.

“We did three demand response events at different times of the day for different hours, but all of them delivered consistent and verifiable load reductions” on the grid, Gupta said. “In one of the events, we dropped half a megawatt of power from the grid within minutes. That [power] could be redeployed elsewhere or reduce the strain on the grid.”

That half megawatt was reduced by delaying charging for just Southern Company’s fleet. Gupta stressed that the effect could be much more if all EV fleets staggered their charging in this way.

But just because charging these vehicles is made a lesser priority for the grid at a certain time, this doesn’t mean they were neglected. In fact, the goal of this pilot was to ensure no impact on fleet uptime. Through this pilot, Ford Pro and Southern Company found that these vehicles were sufficiently charged and ready for work even with the staggered charging. Gupta put it this way:

“We made sure there was no problem as we did [demand response charging],” he said. Once the demand event was over, “the vehicle started charging again. The charger responded accurately. There was no drop-off in terms of someone needing to come in and plug charging again. It just happened seamlessly, and it was invisible to anyone at the back end. It didn't impact their operations, but it was like a small intervention that we did and tried to see what would happen. It worked really well.""

Ensuring fleet uptime while implementing staggered and managed EV charging

Staggered charging or pausing EV charging might leave a fleet owner, manager, or driver skeptical. What if it doesn’t charge enough to be ready for work when you are? Thankfully, Gupta said Ford Pro chargers recognize when a vehicle’s battery is too low and—if the vehicle needs to be charged by a specific time the next day—won’t interfere with charging if it could jeopardize vehicle uptime.

While the pilot with Southern Company was particular to Southern Company’s fleet, Gupta believes the information gathered and data received from the pilot can help other fleets.

“The lessons and the data from this pilot allow us to tailor-manage charging to each [fleet],” Gupta explained. “Our team has already begun applying these learnings with a large national customer where our energy management platform is driving measurable savings without sacrificing uptime—and that’s the key. Scale isn’t about one-size-fits-all. It's all about using the foundation we've built to adapt intelligently.”

Managed charging also has the potential to enable electric fleet vehicles to reach cost parity with gas-powered fleet vehicles, as charge management software prevents vehicles from charging when rates are highest, as long as uptime allows.

Throughout the pilot, Southern Company was able to reduce its charging demand by half a megawatt during a 30-minute demand response event, and its chargers improved efficiency by approximately 10 kW per charger. That’s a savings that fleets can take to their bottom line.","https://img.fleetowner.com/files/base/ebm/fleetowner/image/2025/10/68efe261bdb3ecfaf52f3143-img_9307.png?auto=format,compress&fit=fill&fill=blur&w=1200&h=630",N,,2025-10-15 16:11:03.389413

The investments will center in the American Midwest, including Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, and Michigan, and almost every Stellantis brand sold here will benefit from the rollout.

Welcome To The Family, GME-T4 EVO

One of the most significant additions to the production cadence will be Stellantis' newest four-cylinder engine. A development of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles' Global Medium Engine (GME) family of four-cylinders, the Hurricane T4 EVO engine is rumored to eventually replace the Pentastar 3.6-liter V6 in most of its existing applications (and spread to corporate partner Alfa Romeo). That could mean the new turbo four will come to the Jeep Grand Cherokee, Chrysler Pacifica, and maybe even the Ram 1500, where it should make at least 300 horsepower and 300 pound-feet of torque – an upgrade from the Pentastar.

The GME-T4 EVO ""Hurricane"" will continue to be built at Stellantis' engine plant in Kokomo, Indiana. The company will invest $100 million into the facility to prepare it for the EVO, which will add 100 new jobs to the plant. The previous-generation GME turbo four, which sees duty in everything from the Alfa Romeo Tonale to the Jeep Wrangler 4xe, was exclusively built in Italy until 2022, when Stellantis added the engine to the Kokomo facility's portfolio for U.S.-market vehicles.

The Belvidere Factory Will Reopen Soon

Upon its closure in 2023, Stellantis' facility in Belvidere, Illinois, was slated to reopen to build a rumored Ram midsize truck. Although that plan didn't come to fruition, the automaker is remaining committed to its existing production framework and will invest $600 million to revitalize FCA Belvidere Assembly to produce the recently revealed Jeep Cherokee and an Americanized version of the global Jeep Compass. Although both are expected for the 2026 model year, the Belvidere-assembled crossovers won't likely roll off the line until 2027. But in the lead-up to that production launch, Stellantis expects to offer around 3,300 new jobs in Illinois.

The midsize Ram pickup will migrate instead to Jeep's factory in Toledo, Ohio, where it will be built alongside the Wrangler and Gladiator. Toledo will receive a $400 million investment and create 900 new jobs to build the truck, which Stellantis says is expected in 2028.

New Trucks And SUVs For Michigan

Stellantis also confirmed that it would build a next-generation version of the Dodge Durango, which will likely share its platform with the Jeep Grand Cherokee, at the Detroit Assembly Complex, earmarking $130 million for the task.

The letter was led by U.S. Senators Tim Kaine (D-VA), Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Angela Alsobrooks (D-MD), and Mark R. Warner (D-VA) and U.S. Representatives Don Beyer (D-VA-08) and Steny Hoyer (D-MD-05). The members underscore that the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019, which was passed(link is external) and signed into law during the last shutdown under President Trump, is clear that all federal employees, whether they are excepted or furloughed, are entitled to back pay after a government shutdown ends.

“During the 2018-2019 shutdown, we worked with President Trump to enact the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act (GEFTA) of 2019, the intent of which is clear – federal employees are entitled to retroactive pay in the event of a government shutdown. We applauded President Trump for signing this bipartisan bill into law,” the members wrote.

“The law is clear: all impacted government employees, regardless of excepted or furloughed status, are entitled to back pay after a government shutdown ends, which is consistent with the guidance currently provided by federal agencies, including the Office of Personnel Management (OPM),” the members wrote. “OPM’s shutdown guidance from September 2025 still states that furloughed federal workers will be provided back pay once the government reopens.”

The members continued, “The decision by OMB to remove critical guidance on federal employee back pay is causing unnecessary stress for the federal workforce comprised of nearly 2.2 million employees.”

“We request you immediately clarify and update the Frequently Asked Questions During a Lapse in Appropriations Document and other relevant materials to affirm that furloughed employees will receive back pay, as is required by law,” the members concluded.

Dear Director Vought:

The Office of Management and Budget’s (OMB) recent update to the Frequently Asked Questions During a Lapse in Appropriations document implies that furloughed federal workers are not entitled to back pay. Additionally, a draft OMB memo stated the administration would deny back pay to furloughed federal workers for the current government shutdown. During the 2018-2019 shutdown, we worked with President Trump to enact the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act (GEFTA) of 2019, the intent of which is clear – federal employees are entitled to retroactive pay in the event of a government shutdown. We applauded President Trump for signing this bipartisan bill into law.

On January 16, 2019, the Senate unanimously passed the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act to guarantee back pay for all impacted federal workers once a government shutdown ends. This law was enacted during the longest government shutdown which lasted 35 days at the end of 2018, and into the beginning of 2019. Prior to the law’s passage, Congress had to pass specific legislation after each shutdown to ensure furloughed workers received back pay.

Explicitly, the law guarantees back pay for all federal employees in the event of a government shutdown. “Each employee of the United States Government or of a District of Columbia public employer furloughed as a result of a covered lapse in appropriations shall be paid for the period of the lapse in appropriations, and each excepted employee who is required to perform work during a covered lapse in appropriations shall be paid for such work, at the employee’s standard rate of pay, at the earliest date possible after the lapse in appropriations ends, regardless of scheduled pay dates, and subject to the enactment of appropriations Acts ending the lapse.” The law requires that retroactive pay be required in the event of any government shutdown after December 22, 2018.

The law is clear: all impacted government employees, regardless of excepted or furloughed status, are entitled to back pay after a government shutdown ends, which is consistent with the guidance currently provided by federal agencies, including the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). OPM’s shutdown guidance from September 2025 still states that furloughed federal workers will be provided back pay once the government reopens. The decision by OMB to remove critical guidance on federal employee back pay is causing unnecessary stress for the federal workforce comprised of nearly 2.2 million employees.

Thus, we request you immediately clarify and update the Frequently Asked Questions During a Lapse in Appropriations Document and other relevant materials to affirm that furloughed employees will receive back pay, as is required by law.",http://evans.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/evans.house.gov/files/evo-media-image/Seal_of_the_United_States_Congress.svg_.png,N,,2025-10-15 16:09:52.286522

In a letter sent Tuesday to Energy Secretary Chris Wright, the Democratic lawmakers railed against the DOE’s “abrupt cancellation of $7.56 billion in energy project funding,” including more than $600 million that had been awarded to 38 Colorado projects.
“DOE investments are vital to lowering costs for consumers and maintaining U.S. leadership in a rapidly evolving global energy landscape,” the lawmakers wrote.

In a letter sent Tuesday to Energy Secretary Chris Wright, the Democratic lawmakers railed against the DOE’s “abrupt cancellation of $7.56 billion in energy project funding,” including more than $600 million that had been awarded to 38 Colorado projects.

Sens. Michael Bennet and John Hickenlooper, and Reps. Joe Neguse, Diana DeGette, Jason Crow, and Brittany Pettersen made the case that the terminations of those projects will not only have “harmful impacts” on Colorado’s workforce and economy, but also on energy costs throughout the state amid the rapid buildout of AI data centers all over the country.

“DOE investments are vital to lowering costs for consumers and maintaining U.S. leadership in a rapidly evolving global energy landscape,” the lawmakers wrote. “In an era where artificial intelligence and data centers are driving a rise in energy demand, we must meet these challenges by investing in responsible and affordable energy solutions, rather than destabilizing them.”

The Energy Department announced the elimination of 321 financial awards supporting 223 projects on the second day of the ongoing government shutdown, proclaiming in a press release that those projects “did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs, were not economically viable, and would not provide a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars.”

Renewable energy projects were hit especially hard, as the DOE slashed awards issued by the Offices of Clean Energy Demonstrations, Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, and Grid Deployment. Other canceled projects were initiated by the Manufacturing and Energy Supply Chains, Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy, and Fossil Energy offices.

“On day one, the Energy Department began the critical task of reviewing billions of dollars in financial awards, many rushed through in the final months of the Biden administration with inadequate documentation by any reasonable business standard,” Wright said in a statement. “President Trump promised to protect taxpayer dollars and expand America’s supply of affordable, reliable, and secure energy. Today’s cancellation’s deliver on that commitment. Rest assured, the Energy Department will continue reviewing awards to ensure that every dollar works for the American people.”

The Colorado Democrats strongly rejected Wright’s assertion that projects were “rushed” through the process, noting that applicants “underwent rigorous, externally vetted” reviews and had “invested significant private capital, trusting that the federal government would honor their commitments.”

“Some companies now face closure or layoffs as a direct result of these cancellations,” they noted.

A DOE spokesperson said in a statement to FedScoop that the agency “conducted a thorough, case-by-case review of every award. The Secretary’s May memorandum formalized that process, establishing clear standards to safeguard taxpayer resources. The 321 awards terminated failed to meet the standards required to justify continued taxpayer investment and would have led to less reliable, more expensive energy.

“As the Secretary has stated repeatedly, the Department is restoring common sense by prioritizing affordable, reliable, and secure energy while protecting the best interests of the American people.”

The Colorado Energy Office, meanwhile, is bracing for big changes in peak demand, projecting that the state could see a 14% jump between 2024 and 2031. Increases of that kind have become common across the country with the speedy construction of AI data centers, sparking massive pushback from consumers who can’t keep up with their utility bills.

Congress has begun to take note, with one bipartisan House bill introduced last month that calls for a study from the DOE and the departments of Interior and Agriculture into the impact AI data centers are having on rural areas. Trump’s AI Action Plan, however, pushes for the swift buildout of data centers by embracing “new sources of energy to power it all.”

,Texas Environment,2025-10-15 19:12:58+00:00,El Paso Matters,Meta to build $1.5 billion data center in Northeast El Paso,"Diego Mendoza-Moyers, El Paso Water",,,,,https://elpasomatters.org/2025/10/15/meta-el-paso-texas-data-center-water-electricity-borderplex-alliance/,"El Paso Water each year supplies around 40 billion gallons of water to customers sourced mostly from groundwater wells and, to a lesser extent, the Rio Grande.
El Paso Electric, the water utility’s biggest customer, consumed an average of 19 million gallons of water daily last year, according to El Paso Water’s financial report.
John Balliew, El Paso Water’s chief executive, has previously said that Meta’s El Paso data center would only need to ramp up water usage on extremely hot days.
And El Paso Electric wants to build new infrastructure that serves the data center, because the utility can earn a profit margin on that capital investment.
“From an El Paso standpoint, we were able to identify an amazing site that had great access to infrastructure and energy,” Davis said about why Meta selected the El Paso site for a new facility.","Technology giant Meta Platforms is investing $1.5 billion to build a data center that will employ 100 workers on a 1,000-acre parcel in far Northeast El Paso near the Texas-New Mexico state line, a scaled-up investment from what the company committed to in late 2023.

The increased investment comes as the global artificial intelligence race has led some of the world’s largest companies to the El Paso area to develop new data center facilities that power the modern internet.

A month after Doña Ana County officials approved a separate $165 billion data center campus that OpenAI and Oracle will develop, Meta representatives for the first time Wednesday announced the company’s El Paso data center project publicly during an event at the Plaza Hotel Pioneer Park in Downtown.

In late 2023, Meta negotiated an incentive package with the city in exchange for investing $800 million and also secured a water supply agreement with El Paso Water. But a Meta executive said the company decided to increase its investment amid the industrywide escalation in AI technology development.

“What you’re seeing here is us having to grow with the needs of our business,” Brad Davis, Meta’s director of data center community and economic development, told El Paso Matters.

“Everything that is ultimately needed with Meta and, frankly, everything that’s needed online, is driven by data centers. They’re the backbone that makes everything in modern society possible, allows us to connect billions of people across the world,” Davis said. “This growth that you’re seeing, a lot of it is driven by AI. This data center itself will be optimized for AI workloads.”

Meta center’s electricity, water usage

Companies have been spending hundreds of billions of dollars in recent years across the United States wherever electricity, water and land are readily available in order to develop data centers that house hardware and computer servers that enable AI products.

Davis said Meta’s new El Paso data center will utilize a “closed-loop” liquid cooling system that will recycle water instead of the water-intensive evaporative cooling technology that older data centers use to keep computer equipment from overheating.

Meta’s water supply agreement with El Paso Water permits the site to use an average of 750,000 gallons of potable water daily initially, and that increases to permitted daily average usage of 1.5 million gallons after the campus is fully built out.

El Paso Water each year supplies around 40 billion gallons of water to customers sourced mostly from groundwater wells and, to a lesser extent, the Rio Grande. El Paso Electric, the water utility’s biggest customer, consumed an average of 19 million gallons of water daily last year, according to El Paso Water’s financial report.

At the full usage detailed in the water supply agreement, the Meta facility will be permitted to consume more water than Marathon Petroleum’s refinery in South-Central El Paso used last year, when it purchased 1.1 million gallons from El Paso Water each day on average.

However, Davis said Meta’s facility will use far less water than the permitted amount.

John Balliew, El Paso Water’s chief executive, has previously said that Meta’s El Paso data center would only need to ramp up water usage on extremely hot days.

“That’s what’s ultimately in our contract. It’s probably a number that’s not necessarily indicative of what actual consumption numbers will necessarily be,” Davis said of the permitted water usage figures. “I’m assuming our consumption numbers will be far less.”

Davis said Meta will report the data center’s electricity and water usage in its annual sustainability report posted on its website along with figures for the two dozen other data centers the company operates in the United States.

In addition to 100 permanent positions, Davis said the site will employ 1,800 workers during the construction phase. He said some early work at the site has started, and the goal is to bring the data center into operation by 2028.

El Paso Electric over the last year developed a special electricity rate for Meta’s data center, which the utility said would require more than 100 megawatts of electricity capacity – enough to power tens of thousands of homes – and would operate at 90% efficiency, meaning the data center’s electricity consumption would rarely fluctuate.

In testimony submitted to the Public Utility Commission of Texas, El Paso Electric executives said they conducted a detailed study to determine how much it would cost to serve the large amount of power Meta’s incoming data center will require. The utility’s rates will ensure the company pays the full cost of service and that Meta will not receive discounted rates, according to the utility’s testimony.

“At full operation, the new Data Center will be EPE’ s largest retail customer,” James Schichtl, vice president of customer and regulatory solutions for El Paso Electric, said in filings submitted to the PUC. “The proposed rates are based on a full cost of service analysis for the expected customer retail load profile and do not represent a ‘discount’ relative to the applicable retail rates that would otherwise apply.”

Before the data center’s rates were finalized in August, Public Utility Commissioner Courtney Hjaltman raised the concern that El Paso Electric customers could subsidize the cost to serve Meta’s data center.

As a result, El Paso Electric guaranteed in writing that the next time it seeks to raise customers’ rates, the utility will “provide evidence” that Meta’s El Paso data center is “not being subsidized by other customers and that the rates contained therein do not constitute discounted rates,” according to filings submitted to the PUC.

Meta’s facility likely will be powered by solar panels, although the full details of its electricity supply aren’t clear. Schichtl told the PUC that El Paso Electric assumed the facility would require two large solar farms to meet its power needs. By comparison, the Project Jupiter data center near the Santa Teresa port of entry will rely on a massive natural gas power plant for its power supply.

In general, El Paso Electric is incentivized to welcome data centers into its service territory. For one, data centers that run constantly are customers that produce steady revenue and cash flow compared with residential customers. And El Paso Electric wants to build new infrastructure that serves the data center, because the utility can earn a profit margin on that capital investment.

While Meta’s facility will directly tie into El Paso Electric’s power grid, the Project Jupiter campus in Santa Teresa will not connect to El Paso Electric’s system and is developing its own isolated electricity generation system.

El Paso Meta data center’s city incentives

The main part of the incentive deal Meta negotiated with the city is an abatement of 80% of city property taxes over 35 years. And the city will give $12.5 million to Meta to improve road infrastructure near the data center.

The city pulled that money from the Texas Economic Development fund, a pot of money established after El Paso Electric agreed to pay the city $80 million over 15 years in exchange for the city’s approval of the acquisition of the utility in 2020 by a J.P. Morgan-owned investment fund.

Local supporters of Meta’s project have said the tax breaks are a good deal for the region because, while the city will forgo most of the new potential tax revenue for decades, other taxing entities will receive full property tax payments from Meta. And it’s possible the taxes Meta pays to the city and local taxing entities could grow over time as Meta invests more in the years ahead to refresh computer equipment at its facility.

Critics of tax breaks for data centers, however, argue the projects strain infrastructure and create relatively few jobs in exchange for foregone tax revenue. The city of Tucson rejected an Amazon-led data center project that would have consumed 2 million gallons of water daily.

“Our community has been clamoring for spreading the tax burden from residential taxpayers to the commercial sector,” said Jon Barela, CEO of the Borderplex Alliance, an economic development organization in the region.

“This project will go very far in absorbing much of that tax burden, especially when it comes to the schools, both the Ysleta school district, El Paso Community College, but also health care,” he said, referring to public health care entities such as University Medical Center of El Paso.

Barela and others have touted the benefits the construction of a Meta data center had on Los Lunas, New Mexico, after construction began there in 2015.

Officials with the New Mexico Economic Development Department have said the population of Los Lunas grew by 20% over the last decade – compared with 1% statewide population growth across New Mexico – and attributed that to Meta’s data center investment there.

“It’s pretty safe to draw a straight line from (Meta’s data center) in Los Lunas to this population growth,” Mark Roper, acting secretary of the New Mexico Economic Development Department, recently told the Doña Ana County Board of Commissioners.

The El Paso region broadly may be seeing the beginning of a regional industry centered around building and servicing data centers.

The El Paso City Council last month voted to give incentives worth $875,000 to a San Jose, California-based technology startup company called Ferveret that develops technology to cool data centers with a liquid solution. In exchange, Ferveret said it would hire 30 workers for its facility located at the so-called Innovation Factory at El Paso International Airport.

“Economic development projects, especially at this level of expenditure, will lead to a clustering of potential other data centers,” Barela said. “But let me be clear: not all data centers are created equal. Meta is a world leader in providing the most efficient and cutting-edge data centers when it comes to environmental footprint,” he said, adding that the company invests heavily to minimize the impact of their data center facilities.

The Project Jupiter data center campus – a wholly separate project from Meta’s but a similar facility meant to enable AI – was welcomed by some residents of Doña Ana County, but was also met with fierce criticism and intense concern from others.

After the Doña Ana Board of County Commissioners approved the Project Jupiter data center project during a meeting in Las Cruces on Sept. 19, residents who had spoken for hours in opposition formed a raucous protest in the chambers and screamed and jeered at the commissioners, largely over concerns that project would be an unsustainable drag on the region’s water apply.

Project Jupiter’s developers have said the campus will consume an average of 20,000 gallons of water per day.

Why did Meta choose El Paso?

Davis declined to comment on the opposition to Project Jupiter, but said the local governments and utilities in El Paso were good and welcoming partners to Meta.

“When we’re going through this process, we want to make sure that a data center suits the needs of that particular community,” he said, adding that Meta plans to partner with the nonprofit Dig Deep, which works to provide first-time water service to colonias that lack water or sewer services.

“From an El Paso standpoint, we were able to identify an amazing site that had great access to infrastructure and energy,” Davis said about why Meta selected the El Paso site for a new facility.

“It has a strong pool of talent that we feel absolutely confident will allow us to construct the data center on an optimal timeline at the quality that we require,” Davis said. “We have no concerns about operational staffing.”

On October 8th, state environmental groups delivered letters to members of Congress signed by organizations and companies across ten states: Alaska, Arizona, California, North Carolina, Nevada, Maine, Michigan, Oregon, Pennsylvania, and Washington.

Why we’re defending appliance energy efficiency standards

Federal appliance energy efficiency standards set minimum energy or water efficiency requirements for certain products. These standards save Americans money every day while reducing emissions by avoiding unnecessary energy generation and use. Updated periodically, the standards ensure that each generation of Americans can do more with less energy.

The next round of updated efficiency standards could save the average U.S. household nearly $150 annually on utility bills over two decades. Nationally, businesses could save $13.8 billion every year.

Appliance energy efficiency standards are a common-sense way to protect the environment, consumers’ wallets, and businesses’ bottom line. That’s why Environment America and ten of our state affiliates worked in partnership with other groups to reach out to businesses and organizations across the country to rally support for these standards.

About the letters

Each state’s letter is signed by several organizations, companies, or non-profits in the state that want Congress to protect federal energy efficiency standards and combat rollbacks of the program. Supporters range from companies to local governments to environmental non-profits.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) today led 31 senators in calling on the Trump administration to immediately restore the Solar for All program — a landmark initiative Sanders wrote to help working class families afford rooftop and community-based solar energy.
Energy bills are soaring across the country and millions of families are facing higher living costs.
Indeed, electricity bills are 6.2 percent higher than this time last year, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics,” Sanders and the senators wrote.
“EPA’s reckless decision to terminate Solar for All directly undermines efforts by Congress to reduce energy costs and improve grid resilience.
“The EPA’s illegal termination of Solar for All has left states, communities, and businesses across the country in limbo, with critical projects stalled and vulnerable households facing higher energy costs.","WASHINGTON, Oct. 15 — Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) today led 31 senators in calling on the Trump administration to immediately restore the Solar for All program — a landmark initiative Sanders wrote to help working class families afford rooftop and community-based solar energy.

In a letter to Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Lee Zeldin, Sanders and his colleagues condemned the administration’s decision to cancel $7 billion in Solar for All funding in August. The program would have created tens of thousands of good-paying jobs in communities across the country, lowered residential electricity bills by at least 20% for more than 900,000 households and saved working families more than $8.7 billion in electric costs over the lifetime of the panels.

Joining Sanders as cosigners on the letter are Sens. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Lisa Blunt Rochester (D-Del.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), John Hickenlooper (D-Colo.), Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), Tim Kaine (D-Va.), Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.), Andy Kim (D-N.J.), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Ben Ray Lujan (D-N.M.), Ed Markey (D-Mass.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Patty Murray (D-Wash.), Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), Gary Peters (D-Mich.), Jack Reed (D-R.I.), Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H), Tina Smith (D-Minn.), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), Mark Warner (D-Va.), Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Peter Welch (D-Vt.) and Ron Wyden (D-Ore.).

“Your agency’s decision to terminate Solar for All is not only unlawful — given this funding was congressionally appropriated and fully obligated — but also ill-timed. Energy bills are soaring across the country and millions of families are facing higher living costs. Indeed, electricity bills are 6.2 percent higher than this time last year, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics,” Sanders and the senators wrote. “EPA’s reckless decision to terminate Solar for All directly undermines efforts by Congress to reduce energy costs and improve grid resilience. It jeopardizes economic investments and inflicts severe job losses across the country while undermining the trust and financial certainty that communities, businesses, and local governments have placed in the federal government. Further, it disrupts workforce training initiatives, such as those in West Virginia, Alaska and across the Midwest where solar career pathways and apprenticeship programs are already underway.”

Sanders wrote and passed into law the Solar for All program to slash utility bills, promote clean energy job training and invest in American manufacturing. Vermont was slated to receive more than $62 million to help households install residential solar systems through the initiative.

“The EPA’s illegal termination of Solar for All has left states, communities, and businesses across the country in limbo, with critical projects stalled and vulnerable households facing higher energy costs. We demand the EPA immediately reinstate the Solar for All program, rectify the damage caused by this termination, and ensure grantees can proceed with the swift implementation of residential solar projects to slash utility bills and create many thousands of good jobs. In the meantime, we require a full accounting of how the EPA will rectify the damage caused by this program’s disruptive termination,” Sanders and the senators concluded. “The American people deserve transparency, accountability, and a government that honors its commitments.”",https://www.sanders.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/cropped-Shape-Map-VT-3-32x32.png,N,,2025-10-15 16:10:17.452307

The PV project will power nearly 600 low-income households, a local park district and a commercial business.

Located on Highway 20, the project features 12,000 solar panels spanning 26 acres, with a capacity of just under 5 MW. The project was supported by the Illinois Shines program with an $8.7 million in a renewable energy credit contract.

“Illinois has one of the most ambitious clean energy efforts in the entire nation, and we’re building our future around projects like the Highway 20 Community Solar Farm to accelerate the clean energy transition, revitalize communities and create new jobs,” said Gov. JB Pritzker. “In Illinois, we’ve incentivized tens of billions of dollars in private investment in renewable and clean energy development.

SMART 3.0 is a sustainable incentive program that will advance solar energy development in Massachusetts while being able to quickly respond to changing market conditions.
This will allow DOER to adjust certain program components in response to project development, economic drivers, and overall program costs.
With its previous solar incentive programs, Massachusetts built a nation-leading solar industry, creating thousands of jobs and hundreds of businesses.
The redesigned SMART program is part of a broader initiative by the Healey-Driscoll Administration to lower energy bills for residents and businesses, and to bring more energy into Massachusetts.","Boston — Today, the Healey-Driscoll Administration opened Massachusetts’ updated solar incentive program, Solar Massachusetts Renewable Target 3.0 (SMART). The newly redesigned program was released in June on an emergency basis ahead of the Trump Administration’s rollbacks of bipartisan solar tax credits to help bring more low-cost energy supply into Massachusetts. The incentive program is expected to reduce electricity costs by $300 million next year and will make it easier for companies to invest in Massachusetts.

“To drive down costs, we need more energy - and solar is the fastest, cheapest energy we can bring into Massachusetts” said Governor Maura Healey. “Massachusetts is open for solar business – applications open today.”

“Solar is a homegrown Massachusetts industry,” said Lieutenant Governor Kim Driscoll. “Thousands of our residents rely on solar for their livelihood and to power their homes. We’re ramping up our solar programs to get solar built affordably and in the areas of the state that need it the most.”

“On hot days and cold days, solar is keeping the lights on and powering our businesses. Solar is low-cost energy we can bring online quickly, and it plays a vital role in the reliability of our electric grid,” said Energy and Environmental Affairs Secretary Rebecca Tepper. “With SMART 3.0, we are revitalizing a successful program to lower costs for customers and boost our economy.”

“We are actively working to produce more homegrown clean energy, and strengthening our ability to build more solar is key to that. SMART 3.0 is agile and will respond to rapidly changing market conditions, provide our solar industry with stability, and keep residents employed,” said Energy Resources Commissioner Elizabeth Mahony. “This is how we lower costs for our residents and businesses and provide our region with ample, reliable power.”

DOER will begin accepting applications for the updated SMART program today. The program opening follows updated regulations that became effective on June 20, 2025 and were finalized on September 12, 2025. Program Year 2025 will offer 900 MW of available capacity in an effort to maximize projects that can participate in the SMART 3.0 program and take advantage of the federal Investment Tax Credit. This will lower costs for ratepayers and help to quickly add more locally generated to Massachusetts.

SMART 3.0 is a sustainable incentive program that will advance solar energy development in Massachusetts while being able to quickly respond to changing market conditions. The program provides a flat incentive rate for residential customers and enhanced incentive offerings for low-income households. SMART 3.0 includes strong consumer protection provisions to ensure best practices by solar installers, which will result in fair contracts and meaningful savings for consumers.

The program also takes an innovative approach to land use policy by establishing a mitigation fund that will collect dollars from large solar installations and use those funds to invest in conservation, biodiversity, and other programs targeted at protecting Massachusetts’ natural landscapes to offset the impacts of solar infrastructure. SMART 3.0 provides added incentives for canopy projects and those installed on landfills and brownfields, prioritizing projects in the built environment. The updated program uses a mechanism to respond to market change annually through robust economic analysis. This will allow DOER to adjust certain program components in response to project development, economic drivers, and overall program costs.

The updates increase equity in the SMART program. In addition to a higher incentive rate for low-income households, those customers can qualify through participation in other needs-based programs or through self-attestation. All community solar projects are required to enroll a minimum of 40% low-income customers. A minimum discount on community solar bill credits for low-income customers is also required. SMART 3.0 expands the low-income property definition to include homeless shelters, deed-restricted condos, and properties enrolled in other housing assistance programs. It also supports affordable housing. For every $1.00 of SMART incentive, there are $2.64 in additional financial benefits to affordable housing properties.

With its previous solar incentive programs, Massachusetts built a nation-leading solar industry, creating thousands of jobs and hundreds of businesses. Under DOER’s solar programs, more than 140,000 solar projects, representing more than 4 gigawatts DC of clean energy, have been installed in Massachusetts. This solar deployment has transformed how the New England electric grid operates, helping to keep the lights on and lowering prices for ratepayers.

Solar reduces the need to build transmission and distribution infrastructure, saving hundreds of millions – if not billions – of dollars that ratepayers would otherwise pay to maintain system reliability. During the summer, solar helps reduce peak demand and lowers energy costs and grid investment needs. During the winter, solar production helps avoid the use of scarce fossil fuel resources by other electric generators, which improves system reliability and lowers energy prices for all customers. And during the spring and fall, solar can provide a significant portion of the region’s energy needs and reduce the wholesale costs of energy for everyone. For example, during the afternoon of April 20, 2025, over 55% of the electricity demand on the New England electric grid was met by distributed solar facilities. Demand on the electric grid that afternoon reached an all-time low.

The redesigned SMART program is part of a broader initiative by the Healey-Driscoll Administration to lower energy bills for residents and businesses, and to bring more energy into Massachusetts. In March, Governor Healey announced the Administration’s Energy Affordability Agenda to identify and advance actions to lower energy bills, which will save about $6 billion over five years. In May, Governor Healey filed the Energy Affordability, Independence & Innovation Act, which will get charges off bills and bring more energy into the state. To drive more solar development, the legislation equips the state with a more authority to procure energy resources like solar and secure the best price as market conditions evolve, while still reducing ratepayer net metering costs. An independent analysis of the bill’s savings found it could save customers over $13 billion. On September 29, Governor Healey hosted a Solar Summit to convene solar developers, trade associations, and labor and policy leaders to identify actions Massachusetts can take to harness the potential of solar to lower costs and attract investment. And yesterday, the Governor called on the DPU to launch the first-ever comprehensive review to lower gas and electric costs.

Statements of Support

Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell:

“In response to consumer complaints received by my office, SMART 3.0 strengthens consumer protections by eliminating early termination fees and unreasonable cancellation delays for community shared solar customers. I am grateful to the Healey-Driscoll Administration for their partnership on this important issue. As the Commonwealth's ratepayer advocate, I will continue to advance clean energy solutions that support Massachusetts' clean energy goals while keeping affordability and equity top of mind for all residents.""

Kate Daniel, Northeast Regional Director, Coalition for Community Solar Access (CCSA):

“The Healey-Driscoll Administration continues to show strong leadership in prioritizing solar as a solution to rising energy costs. The expansion and modernizing of the SMART program is an important step forward. We look forward to working with the DOER team to ensure projects can participate starting on day one, and that the program improvements translate into real, immediate benefits for all Massachusetts customers.”

Kris Sarri, State Director, The Nature Conservancy in Massachusetts:

“SMART 3.0 is a practical way to accelerate the rollout of much-needed renewable energy, while using solid science to influence siting for better outcomes for people and nature. We were pleased to collaborate with the state to help achieve a balanced approach that The Nature Conservancy stands for.”

“The decision to terminate the DOE’s agreement with ARCHES is not only in clear violation of its grant agreement, but profoundly shortsighted,” wrote the lawmakers.","Washington, D.C. — Following the Trump administration’s decision to illegally cancel roughly $8 billion of federal funding for clean energy projects, including $1.2 billion for the Alliance for Renewable Clean Hydrogen Energy Systems (ARCHES) Hydrogen Hub, Rep. Dave Min, along with Representatives Mike Levin and George Whitesides, led the full California Democratic delegation in a letter to Energy Secretary Chris Wright condemning the Department of Energy’s (DOE) cut to ARCHES, and demanding the funding be restored.

California’s regional hydrogen hub was projected to create hundreds of thousands of new jobs throughout the state, drive cutting-edge technological innovation, and help the United States maintain its domestic energy dominance, all while reducing rising energy costs and improving air quality for millions of California residents.

“We know that the economy of the future will be based on cheap and plentiful renewable energies,” said Rep.

We cannot concede global energy dominance to China, and hydrogen fuel storage will be an important pillar of providing the energy needed for our economy in the 21st century. I urge the Department of Energy to reverse this decision.”

You can read the full letterhere.

“The decision to terminate the DOE’s agreement with ARCHES is not only in clear violation of its grant agreement, but profoundly shortsighted,” wrote the lawmakers. “Data centers and artificial intelligence are driving an aggressive demand for new sources of power, and countries that innovate to overcome these bottlenecks will lead the 21st - century economy. This administration cannot be pulling the plug on an American industry and crushing domestic innovation as China races ahead, pouring billions of dollars into its own energy sector.”

They continued, “This unlawful action is all the more alarming considering that ARCHES has demonstrated significant progress and remains a success story in the regional hydrogen hub program. Terminating the grant agreement will kneecap a major economic driver for the State of California—as ARCHES is projected to create over 200,000 jobs—while also harming local economies in Republican and Democratic states alike. The hub is already driving further demand to invest in and build new factories throughout the United States, with many ARCHES projects placing purchase orders or leveraging existing manufacturing facilities in states like Alabama, Arizona, Georgia, Texas, and others.”

The representatives are demanding answers as to the legal justification for the cancellation of these grants by October 29, 2025.

Vice President Kashim Shettima announced this at the inaugural Nigerian Renewable Energy Innovation Forum (NREIF) 2025 in Abuja on Tuesday, reports The Nation.
He assured investors and development partners of the administration’s commitment to policy reforms that de-risk private investment, promote local manufacturing, and strengthen the renewable energy value chain.
“We are enhancing incentives for local manufacturing, streamlining regulatory frameworks, and deepening collaboration with state governments and investors to accelerate the emergence of a self-sustaining renewable energy market,” he added.
The Vice President also called on governors to promote renewable industrial clusters as engines of green growth across the country.","Nigeria is set to unlock over $400 million in new investments as part of its ambitious plan to become Africa’s hub for renewable energy. Vice President Kashim Shettima announced this at the inaugural Nigerian Renewable Energy Innovation Forum (NREIF) 2025 in Abuja on Tuesday, reports The Nation.

Speaking on behalf of President Bola Tinubu, Shettima said the country’s energy transition is being structured to attract major investments, expand access to electricity, and create a self-sustaining clean energy market to power homes, industries, and innovation nationwide.

According to the Vice President’s office, over $23 billion is needed to bridge Nigeria’s energy access gap and connect millions still living without reliable electricity, even as the administration targets a total installed capacity of 277 gigawatts by 2060.

“We are blessed with the minerals that power clean technologies, and Nigeria brings to the table youth, ambition, and untapped renewable potential. Let us seize this moment and affirm that Nigeria is ready to harness her resources, unlock her capital, and become the vibrant heartbeat of Africa’s renewable energy revolution,” Shettima said.

He assured investors and development partners of the administration’s commitment to policy reforms that de-risk private investment, promote local manufacturing, and strengthen the renewable energy value chain. “We are enhancing incentives for local manufacturing, streamlining regulatory frameworks, and deepening collaboration with state governments and investors to accelerate the emergence of a self-sustaining renewable energy market,” he added.

The Vice President highlighted the “Nigeria First” industrial strategy, which envisions localised renewable energy supply chains, from solar panel assembly plants in Lagos to battery recycling hubs across industrial corridors. This strategy aims to position Nigeria as a leader in Africa’s clean energy sector.

He announced that the forum had mobilised over $400 million in investment commitments, covering solar panels, smart meters, battery storage, and recycling facilities, expected to generate more than 1,500 direct jobs across several states. “The Ministry of Power is working on policies that will lay the foundation for a more decentralised, competitive, and inclusive electricity market,” Shettima said, urging development partners and Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) to localise technologies and invest in skills and knowledge transfer.

The Vice President also called on governors to promote renewable industrial clusters as engines of green growth across the country.

Minister of Power, Chief Adebayo Adelabu, described the forum as a new chapter in Nigeria’s energy transformation, highlighting the government’s commitment to large-scale local solar production and energy diversification. Mallam Abba Aliyu, Managing Director of the Rural Electrification Agency (REA), said NREIF bridges policy and research to accelerate Nigeria’s transition to a sustainable green energy ecosystem.

In a goodwill message, UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed, represented by UN Resident Coordinator Mohammed M. Malick Fall, pledged support for Nigeria’s renewable energy agenda, noting the forum reflects Africa’s determination to power homes, schools, and industries through clean energy.

The Dutch Ambassador to Nigeria, Bengt van Loosdrecht, also reaffirmed the Netherlands’ partnership with Nigeria in renewable energy, calling the forum “a milestone in the deepening of bilateral cooperation.”

During the event, Vice President Shettima, along with the governors of Jigawa, Bayelsa, and Ogun states, and representatives from REA and other agencies, signed several multi-million-dollar Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) with private sector players and development partners, including the Dutch government, aimed at expanding Nigeria’s renewable energy manufacturing base.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Renewable-Energy-Solar.jpeg,N,,2025-10-15 18:11:30.518999

Community Standards

While A.I. data center facilities are critical to our modern economy, they often rely on powerful cooling systems, backup generators, and other industrial equipment that can cause significant disruptions for nearby residents, schools, and community spaces.

Currently, there are no consistent statewide standards that require data centers to mitigate these impacts. This gap leaves communities vulnerable to quality-of-life concerns when facilities are sited nearby.

For these reasons, we will be introducing legislation directing municipalities to regulate data centers and adopt local ordinances to limit harmful impacts on nearby communities.

These ordinances would include provisions for sound barriers, set back distances, building design standards, equipment modifications, and other measures to reduce community disruptions.

If data centers are going to be built in our neighborhoods, they must be sited and regulated with the well-being of nearby residents in mind.

This legislation will:

-- Protect the health and well-being of residents living near data centers.

-- Ensure responsible siting and operation of these facilities.

-- Support sustainable economic development that preserves community quality of life.

Water Use

A.I. data center facilities often consume substantial amounts of water, primarily for cooling. Larger data centers consume millions of gallons daily, on par with entire communities.

The impact of these massive withdrawals on local water supplies remains unclear, but one thing is certain: we must make sure that our residents, communities, and environment are not disproportionately affected.

New legislation would require covered data center projects with substantial water needs to proactively inform the state prior to construction.

This step will ensure that state agencies, in collaboration with local governments and river basin commissions, can assess potential impacts and ensure adequate considerations are in place to protect our water supplies.

Energy Efficiency

Data centers require an enormous amount of uninterrupted electricity to power computer servers, cooling systems, and supporting infrastructure.

While some companies are working to incorporate energy-efficient technologies, more must be done to mitigate the impacts on utility customers and Pennsylvania’s already strained energy grid.

New legislation will require data centers seeking the state sales tax exemptions to obtain recognized energy efficiency certifications, such as LEED, Energy Star, Green Globes, or International Organization for Standardization (ISO).

This proposal will ensure that only data centers meeting the highest efficiency standards can benefit from state tax incentives.

Data centers that achieved such certifications have seen lower operational costs, improved sustainability, and a stronger market reputation, creating a win-win situation for both businesses and communities.

With this proposal, we can incentivize data centers to operate sustainably, reduce electricity demands, and help meet Pennsylvania’s future energy needs. At the end of the day, the cleanest and cheapest energy is the energy we don’t use.

Transparency

Without clear reporting, it is difficult for policymakers to fully understand and mitigate impacts on ratepayers, the electric grid, local water supplies, and our environment.

New legislation would require data center developers and end users to disclose the nature of their operations and report energy and water usage to the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources (DCNR).

Based on this reporting, DCNR would prepare an impact report and make recommendations to the General Assembly on how to address any environmental concerns posed by data centers.

These transparency measures will play a crucial role in protecting our residents, informing sound policy decisions, and safeguarding natural resources for future generations.

Appropriate guardrails can only be applied to this growing industry if residents and policymakers alike have an unrestricted view into data center development and operation.

Emergency Preparedness

The high-density layout of computing and storage equipment could lead to fast-spreading fires.

The consequences of a data center fire extend beyond service interruptions, loss of data, and threats to facilities; fires of this type pose special hazards to firefighters and other first responders.

Data centers are huge buildings with complex floor plans, ultra-secure perimeters, and high-value equipment that reacts poorly to water.

As such, fighting fires at data centers require specialized training, planning, and cooperation between firefighters and on-site staff such as security and engineering personnel.

New legislation would assist local governments and fire departments in the event of this type of emergency, including requiring data centers to meet the National Fire Protection Association’s standards for energy storage facilities, updated fire plans and coordination with local government and emergency response agencies.

Data center fires are rare. Nonetheless, it is our responsibility to give those on the ground all the tools they need to quickly and safely extinguish data center fires.

Click Here for the co-sponsor memo.

Prevailing Wage

Under Act 25 of 2021, purchases of computer data center equipment are exempt from the Pennsylvania sales and use tax.

While these exemptions are intended to encourage private investment, there are no eligibility requirements that guarantee family-sustaining wages for the men and women who build these facilities.

As a result, public dollars may indirectly subsidize low-wage or out-of-state contractors at the expense of our skilled local workforce.

New legislation would require data center developers to pay the prevailing wage on all construction projects to remain eligible for the state sales tax exemption.

This reform strikes a balance: developers would still have access to incentives to grow in our state, while workers would be protected with fair wages that reflect the going rate in their trades and regions.

A Wisconsin Examiner piece published Monday highlights the continued costs of the Trump administration’s vendetta against clean energy

Madison, WI – As Semafor recently reported, the Trump administration is considering cutting an additional $12 billion worth of clean energy projects, including $130 million worth of projects based in Wisconsin. A piece published Monday in the Wisconsin Examiner highlighted how these potential cuts threaten Wisconsin’s burgeoning clean energy industry, leading to lost jobs and even higher utility bills for Wisconsinites.

Key quotes from the Wisconsin Examiner piece include:

“These [investments] are all win-win that all of us want regardless of our political affiliation. This is all bottom-line stuff…[Cuts] mean[s] higher electric bills, higher energy bills, fewer choices and lost jobs. We’re going to lose momentum.” – John Imes, director of the Wisconsin Environmental Initiative

“We’re trying to make our energy systems more efficient and better so everybody’s paying less for energy…“Everything we’re doing is trying to make buildings and homes more affordable to live in with lower utility bills. If we’re not able to do that, that’s also a cost to people in Wisconsin.” – Scott Hackel, Slipstream’s vice president for research

“Collateral damage from the Trump administration’s remarkably poor governance record continues to collect, this time in Kaukauna. I can’t think of something more insulting than making the electric grid of a place known as ‘Electric City’ less safe or efficient.” – Outagamie County Executive Tom Nelson

“They’re just trying to roll back a lot of the green energy and infrastructure [investments]. … It’s trying to make time stand still, and it just won’t if the United States is going to compete globally…It’s not just taking money away and eliminating classes. It’s eliminating opportunities and a chance for generational change for people who really need it.” – Dan Bukiewicz, head of the Milwaukee Building Trades Council

Power generation from solar photovoltaic installations is also expected to shrink compared to 2022’s estimates due to the Trump policy u-turn, although only by 5%.
A major takeaway, however, is that the higher generation peak comes with a sharp rise in power emissions that could be avoided if a cleaner power mix was deployed instead.","(Reuters) – The abrupt cuts to U.S. federal clean energy incentives alongside fresh support for coal and gas-fired power will trigger a swell in North America’s emissions in the coming decades as the U.S. generation mix remains fossil fuel reliant.

Indeed, consultancy DNV projects that North America’s power emissions from 2025 to 2050 will be 3 billion metric tons more than was projected in 2022, when the previous U.S. administration rolled out aggressive clean power goals.

Expanded use of fossil fuels, however, will result in a faster climb in total power generation from now through 2040 compared to 2022’s projections, which contained a steep drop-off in estimated coal-fired output over the coming years.

COAL’S LONGER LIFE

North American power generation by fossil fuel power sources from 2025 to 2050 will grow by around 8% compared to DNV’s 2022 estimates, due mainly to the Trump administration’s stated expansions to coal and gas-fired power.

Coal-fired power generation from now through 2050 is projected to be 46% more than was estimated by DNV in 2022, following the Trump administration’s new policies that will extend the life of U.S. coal power plants by several years.

North American gas-fired generation through 2050 will grow by around 5% from DNV’s 2022 estimate, due in large part to expectations that new gas capacity will be developed over the coming decade in response to gas-friendly policies in the U.S.

WIND WOES

Generation from clean power sources during 2025 to 2050 will decline by around 3% from 2022’s estimates, again due to U.S. policy changes that have resulted in sharp drops to federal incentives for clean power deployment.

Total power generation from wind farms in North America is estimated to fall by around 24% from DNV’s 2022 estimate, following the aggressive slashing of U.S. federal support for wind development since President Trump returned to office.

Power generation from solar photovoltaic installations is also expected to shrink compared to 2022’s estimates due to the Trump policy u-turn, although only by 5%.

Steady declines in solar system costs, coupled with the fact that solar systems remain the fastest source of new electricity for grid managers, are expected to keep solar capacity growth relatively firm despite the policy shifts.

Continued federal support for battery systems going forward is expected to result in a 71% surge in generation from solar-plus-storage systems compared to DNV’s 2022 estimates.

Sharply lower battery costs compared to 2022 are another factor driving expected solar-plus-storage uptake compared to 2022.

EMISSIONS IMPACT

In its 2022 outlook for global energy generation and emissions, DNV estimated that North America’s power emissions after carbon capture sequestration and storage were likely to steadily decline from around 1.2 billion tons of CO2 a year in the 2020s to around 360 million tons a year by the 2040s.

In its 2025 report, however, those emissions estimates veer higher for the next decade or so due to the extension of coal use within the United States, and average around 100 million tons of CO2 more than the 2022 emissions estimates.

Emissions from coal-fired generation had been projected to average around 310 million tons of CO2 a year through 2035 in the DNV 2022 report.

In this year’s report, coal-fired emissions are seen averaging around 470 million tons a year through 2035, which marks a more than a 50% increase.

Between 2025 and 2050, that sustained higher level of coal-fired generation is expected to result in 2.6 billion tons of CO2 more than was projected in 2022, and around 3.2 billion tons more of total power sector emissions.

To justify the extended use of coal plants, the Trump administration has argued that rapidly rising electricity demand from data centres and other businesses could result in potential power shortages unless output from fossil fuel plants increased.

And it is clear from DNV’s generation projections that total power output in North America will rise faster through 2040 under the current administration’s policy scenario than under the policies that governed DNV’s projections in 2022.

A major takeaway, however, is that the higher generation peak comes with a sharp rise in power emissions that could be avoided if a cleaner power mix was deployed instead.

The credit, officially started under the Energy Improvement and Extension Act of 2008, revised under The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, and expanded under former President Biden’s 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, had been a key driver of EV sales in the United States. Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act on July 4, which set Sept. 30 as the final date for receiving EV purchase credits, effectively terminating the benefit.

“Following recent U.S. government policy changes, including the termination of certain consumer tax incentives for EV purchases and the reduction in the stringency of emissions regulations, we expect the adoption rate of EVs to slow,” GM said in a filing.

GM shares fell 2.5% in premarket trading, but have rebounded since as the broad market recovered...

As Evgenia Filimianova details below for The Epoch Times, according to the filing, $1.2 billion of the loss is related to non-cash impairments, mostly write-downs of EV assets.

The remaining $400 million will be paid in cash for contract cancellations and commercial settlements tied to EV investments.

The company said its review of EV manufacturing and battery component investments is ongoing.

“It is reasonably possible that we will recognize additional future material cash and non-cash charges that may adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows in the period in which they are recognized,” GM added.

GM noted that the costs, along with several smaller ones this quarter, will be recorded as adjustments in its non-GAAP results, which exclude one-time items from the company’s official earnings reported under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).

The automaker also said its EV realignment will not affect current Chevrolet, GMC, and Cadillac electric models, which “remain available to consumers.”

Industry Changes

GM had previously pledged to invest up to $35 billion in electric and autonomous vehicles through 2025, aiming to transition most of its portfolio to zero-emission models later in the decade.

However, slower-than-expected consumer adoption, high production costs, and uncertain government policy have made that goal more difficult to achieve.

GM joins other automakers reassessing the EV market, including rival Ford Motor Co. Last year, Ford said it would take a $1.9 billion hit from plans that included canceling an all-electric SUV and delaying an electric pickup truck.

Despite the planned cutbacks, GM said this month that its overall sales remain strong. The automaker reported total U.S. vehicle sales of 2.2 million through the first three quarters of 2025, its fastest pace in a decade.

GM said the Chevrolet Equinox EV was the best-selling electric model outside Tesla, while its Cadillac Lyriq, Optiq, and Vistiq models all ranked among the top 10 in U.S. EV sales.

Analysts have said that the end of the federal EV tax credit “will test whether the electric vehicle market is mature enough to thrive on its own fundamentals or still needs support to expand further.”

In a Sept. 2 report, Duncan Aldred, GM’s North America president, said the company expects lower EV sales next quarter after the tax credits end on Sept. 30. He added that it may take a few months for the market to steady.

“Still, we believe GM can continue to grow EV market share,” he wrote. “We are seeing marginal competitors dramatically scale back their products and plans, which should end much of the overproduction and irrational discounts we’ve seen in the marketplace.”

On the gap-filling and thermal interface front, H.B.","Effective thermal management is one of the most critical aspects of EV battery pack design. Engineers must not only ensure efficient heat dissipation during charging and discharging cycles but also maintain uniform temperature across all cells to optimize performance and extend battery life. This requires integrating advanced materials—such as flame-retardant foams, adhesives, and gap fillers—that can simultaneously control heat flow, provide structural reinforcement, and improve overall safety.

To learn more about addressing these thermal challenges at the material level, Charged recently chatted with Germaine Mariaselvaraj, Technical Service Manager at H.B. Fuller. Germaine explained how their EV Protect foam series addresses a core challenge in EV battery design: preventing thermal runaway from propagating between cells. The foam acts as a fire‐retardant barrier, helping isolate a single failing cell so that the rest of the pack remains intact. Beyond just safety, it also delivers structural and vibration-resistance benefits, which many battery integrators rely on to meet durability standards without adding heavy metal or plastic stiffeners.

H.B. Fuller’s first offering, EV Protect 4006, is a semi-structural foam that flows into cavities and expands to encapsulate components. As market demands shifted toward more structural solutions, H.B. Fuller introduced EV Protect 5006, 5008, and 5009—versions with increased stiffness that allow for the reduction or replacement of traditional structural parts. The upshot: reduced part count, lower mass and a more integrated pack layout that supports newer architectures like cell-to-pack or cell-to-chassis.

Beyond thermal management, the foam contributes to noise, vibration and harshness (NVH) control and thermal insulation. Some customers rely on the foam to help them pass vibration testing that they could not achieve with bare components, and because the foam envelops the cells, it also mitigates temperature swings in extreme ambient conditions. In cold or hot environments, the foam moderates local temperatures, helping reduce the impact on range or battery performance.

Germaine also discussed H.B. Fuller’s EV Bond 775, a reactive hot-melt adhesive that streamlines battery module assembly. By replacing tape or multi-step adhesive processes, this reactive hot-melt enables faster bonding of mica to lids, cells and cooling tubes. That accelerates cycle time, reduces handling, and cuts scrap or rework—all valuable in high-volume battery manufacturing.

On the gap-filling and thermal interface front, H.B. Fuller’s EV Them 288 (a silicone-free MS polymer) competes with traditional silicone gap fillers. Because it’s silicone-free, it helps meet stricter OEM constraints on materials in the manufacturing environment.",https://chargedevs.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/HB-Fuller-Final.jpg,N,,2025-10-15 15:11:00.136317

Called RetailEdge, these next-gen chargers have a slim design with a 27-inch touchscreen that includes an AI-assisted interface. They can self-diagnose and address software errors that most often take down chargers.

The Seattle-based startup not only sells its fast-chargers to retailers, but it also installs and services the stations, with first deliveries slated for later next year.

Many EV owners have been there. With their battery's state of charge getting low, they pull into an unoccupied stall at a public DC fast-charger only to find that it's not working. It's a frustrating feeling that's unfortunately more common than it should be as the number of registered electric vehicles continues to grow. Perhaps surprisingly, the problem usually isn't caused by faulty hardware but rather a software issue, according to Electric Era CEO Quincy Lee. Luckily, his company's newly unveiled fast-chargers can self-diagnose and fix those glitches ASAP, which should make its retail-focused public chargers more reliable.

A New Era of Public Charging

Haven't heard of Electric Era? The Seattle-based startup was founded in 2020, and its first charging stations went live in late 2022. Currently, it claims 130 stalls in 13 states, but EE is different from, say, Electrify America or Tesla's Supercharger network. Unlike those forward-facing brands, Electric Era calls itself a ""solutions provider,"" as it's basically a one-stop shop for retailers such as Costco to buy fast-chargers and have them installed and maintained without dealing with a middleman. And that's where EE's next-generation chargers, coined RetailEdge, come into play, as they're now available to order and aim to make the user experience more effortless than frustrating.

A charger that works is obviously less frustrating than one that doesn't, and Electric Era claims an uptime rate of 99.8 percent per port. The fast-chargers also feature an innovative battery-backed platform that's said to help with reliability and reduce operating costs by up to 70 percent versus traditional chargers. The lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) battery cells are similar to EV batteries, with EE packs providing 220- or 379-kWh capacities. The other bonus of using standalone batteries is that it reduces the peak energy draw from the grid, not to mention these stations take less time to install by avoiding major upgrades to electric infrastructure. Electric Era claims that it can complete an entire installation in 54 days.

The new RetailEdge kiosks are attractive—for an EV charger, anyway—and retailers have countless branding options. Along with CCS-type and NACS plugs, the chargers have a sleek design that EE claims is dramatically slimmer than their predecessors. And each unit includes a 27-inch display that responds to touch and voice inputs. The customizable interface also allows people to tap-to-pay, and it incorporates a ""HaloAI"" assistant to help rookies and veterans alike understand what they're doing as well as troubleshoot any problems.

And that brings us back to the common problem among public fast-chargers: reliability. Electric Era appears to have an effective strategy, with its vertically integrated chargers able to operate on a local real-time control loop and autonomously address repair faults, so no waiting for a human to arrive on the scene. ""We engineered our systems to detect and correct errors on our chargers before the customer even sees them,"" said Lee, who previously worked for Starlink, a satellite internet service developed by SpaceX. With these new fast-chargers, customers will also have the option to add a Starlink-based connection for an extra layer of reliability.

Electric Era hasn't yet announced any commercial partnerships, but it did say that the first deliveries of its RetailEdge chargers should take place sometime in the second half of next year.

""Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a critical part of maintaining and growing the manufacturing industry in our state.
Those concerns led to a push in the most recent legislative session to block or restrict carbon capture.","Gov. Jeff Landry declared a moratorium Wednesday on new applications for carbon capture injection wells in Louisiana and wants state regulators to prioritize review of the more than 30 applications already before them.

Landry's order calls for companies to make more effort to seek out public and local government input on pending projects. That tracks recent changes in state law and new internal policies in Landry's administration.

Landry also said the state Department of Conservation and Energy is creating a new priority list for existing carbon capture projects. Companies will be required to take a number of steps before their projects can get on the list.

In a 12-page executive order, Landry says the changes are happening ""to provide a clear roadmap for citizens and local officials,"" to create transparency for the public and to recognize the reality of the intensive time required to review each project — an estimated 2,000 hours.

""Local government and citizens, through their local government, have a right to be heard to ensure safety, transparency, and local input,"" part of the preamble to the governor's order says.

The department has also already prioritized six projects among the more than 30 due to the economic impact and lack of old wells and other routes that could provide a path for leaking CO2.

Carbon capture and sequestration involves pumping carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases produced from industrial processes deep underground, compressed to a near-liquid state. The chemicals would be stored there permanently.

Industry, LSU scientists and other sources argue Louisiana's sedimentary geology is prime to safely use the technology.

The technology, however, has recently sparked opposition in conservative-leaning rural Louisiana, which typically is supportive of oil and gas and new industries. It has also drawn criticism from the state's more left-leaning environmental justice movement.

They worry about storing waste carbon dioxide under tens of thousands of acres of farm and pasture land, country estates, and timber properties.

Though Landry calls on state departments to work together, the order has the potential to slow an oil, gas and petrochemical industry push to find carbon storage sites across Louisiana and make the state's fossil fuel-heavy industries more competitive in foreign markets worried about climate change.

The order sparked an immediate response from the Louisiana Chemical Association, a major trade group for big manufacturers in the Mississippi River corridor and elsewhere in the state.

David Cresson, president and CEO of the group, said the association appreciated Landry's ""focus on public safety, environmental stewardship, and economic growth"" but was troubled by the new order that, Cresson said, could undermine the efficiency that gaining state primacy over carbon capture applications in 2024 had promised.

Primacy allowed the state to take over final approval of carbon capture projects from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in hopes of speeding along the process.

Cresson noted LCA members have already invested $60 billion in Louisiana projects that depend on carbon capture and storage, but the ""conditional moratorium"" sends ""the wrong message to the market at a pivotal moment for Louisiana’s economy.""

""Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a critical part of maintaining and growing the manufacturing industry in our state. A pause on applications, regardless of the reasoning, signals uncertainty for projects that enable lower-emissions production, support thousands of high-wage jobs, and encourage future reinvestment,"" Cresson said.

Concerns from critics of carbon capture revolve around a mix of issues: land rights; the impact on underground aquifers if CO2 leaks; skepticism of climate change; skepticism of its effectiveness in fully capturing CO2; and the use of federal money to finance the effort.

Those concerns led to a push in the most recent legislative session to block or restrict carbon capture. Though most of those bills failed, one requiring the state give substantial consideration to local officials' concerns has triggered new directives within the state Department of Conservation and Energy.

The order also says other recent changes on land acquisition for CO2 pipelines and creating carbon storage areas would constitute a new ""landowner bill of rights"" that should guide government decision-making on new carbon capture projects.

Those new laws make it harder for pipeline companies to gain land expropriation power for CO2 pipelines, increase public notice requirements about expropriation plans and raise the percentage of landowners who must agree—from 75% to 85%—before a region, or ""unit,"" can be set aside for underground CO2 storage.

Since gaining primacy in early 2024, the state, through its Department of Conservation and Energy, has been asked to review 33 projects with more than 100 wells.

GM’s reversal shows that even the biggest names can get swept up in the wave of optimism that electric cars would take over faster than they have.
This isn’t the end of electric vehicles.
Electric vehicles are part of the future, but not the whole future.
I’ve talked on air for a number of years about the future losses electric cars would cause.","Nobody likes a wise guy. You know the type: They are always telling you “I told you so!” I’m not that kind of guy, I hope you know that by now, but in this case, I did indeed tell you-back in 2017. To be more precise, I warned the automakers to slow their roll dumping billions into electric cars when there was no evidence Americans wanted them.

So, when General Motors announced this week that it would take a $1.6 billion write-off tied to its electric vehicle investments, it wasn’t just a financial footnote. It was a huge red flag. GM said about $1.2 billion of that is a non-cash impairment on manufacturing capacity, and another $400 million covers canceled supplier contracts and other costs. This isn’t a minor accounting adjustment; it’s a course correction. Behind the numbers lies a story of ambition colliding with reality.

GM’S $1.6 BILLION DOLLAR LOSS ON EVS—IN PERSPECTIVE

If you had $1.6 billion, you could buy:

• Roughly 22,000 brand-new Chevrolet Silverado pickups—even if each one stickered at $70,000.

• About 30,000 Cadillac LYRIQs, GM’s own electric SUV that costs around $55,000.

• Every single Corvette built this year—and still have money left over for a private jet to park next to them.

• A small NFL franchise, like the Cincinnati Bengals or Jacksonville Jaguars were valued not long ago.

• Half of the Detroit Tigers, or most of an NHL team.

• Ten years of NASCAR sponsorship at a top-tier team.

• A brand-new assembly plant and still have several hundred million left for R&D.

• Around 40 million barrels of oil—which is more than the U.S. burns in two days.

• Or, as a reminder of scale, enough to buy a fleet of 40 Gulfstream G700 jets or an entire year’s production of Lucid Airs at current sales rates.

In the regulatory filing this week, GM went on to say:

“The reassessment of our EV capacity and manufacturing footprint, including our investments in our battery component manufacturing, is ongoing, and it is reasonably possible that we will recognize additional future material cash and non-cash charges that may adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows in the period in which they are recognized.”

(Translated: There are going to be more losses, we just don’t know how big a bloodbath it is yet.)

Stop The Insanity!

Way back in 2017, I wrote a column titled “Stop the Electric Car Insanity,” where I warned automakers to slow down and let the market decide how fast consumers wanted to transition to electric vehicles. I raised concerns about range anxiety, charging infrastructure, battery recycling, and whether there would be enough demand to absorb a flood of EVs. Fast-forward eight years, and many of those challenges haven’t just lingered—they’ve grown.

GM’s loss makes that clear. The company blamed policy shifts, including the removal of the $7,500 federal EV tax credit and changes to emissions rules. That shouldn’t surprise anyone. The EV market has been heavily propped up by government incentives since day one, and when those fade, so does a big part of the buying motivation.

GM insists it’s not abandoning electric vehicles entirely. Chevrolet, GMC, and Cadillac will continue with their current EV lineups, but the company is reviewing its factory footprint and investment priorities. Translation: GM is hedging its all-electric bet. The shame here is that I’ve said many times on the Car Pro Show that currently, GM was producing the very best EVs on the market.

I Warned Ford’s CEO As Well

This moment reminds me of what I told Ford CEO Jim Farley in my open letter last year. Ford had just admitted it was losing roughly $100,000 on every EV it sold. I said then—and it holds true now—that building a product the public isn’t asking for is not leadership. It’s gambling. I urged him to “dance with the one that brung you”—to remember that Ford’s profitability and brand loyalty were built on trucks, SUVs, and performance cars that people actually want. The same message now applies to GM.

What frustrates me most is how little the industry seems to have learned. Back when automakers were chasing Tesla’s shadow, I said they were sprinting into the future without checking the fuel gauge. Building dozens of EV models before the public truly demanded them was always going to create a glut. It’s basic economics: supply without demand equals losses, and the losses per vehicle were mind-boggling.

So Many Questions Still Unanswered

The same pain points remain. Charging stations are still too few and too unreliable in much of the country. Battery degradation and recycling are still big question marks. Depreciation is brutal—many EVs lose staggering amounts of value after the first year, which is why I tell listeners to LEASE, not purchase, EVs. And outside of early adopters, consumers are hesitant to pay a premium for a product that feels like it’s still in beta testing.

GM’s reversal shows that even the biggest names can get swept up in the wave of optimism that electric cars would take over faster than they have. Reality is different. Buyers still want trucks and SUVs with long range, fast refueling, and affordable price tags. GM’s move back toward hybrids and efficient gas models isn’t regression—it’s realism.

This isn’t the end of electric vehicles. It’s a reset. The industry is realizing that “all-electric by 2035” slogans make for good headlines but don’t always make business sense. Policy changes, consumer hesitation, and infrastructure gaps have turned what was supposed to be a straight road into a winding detour.

Will Automakers Learn From This?

For the auto industry, the lessons are clear: build capacity only when demand justifies it, don’t rely on endless subsidies, and remember that internal combustion and hybrid vehicles still have a long future ahead. The market—not regulators, not press releases—should set the pace. The sudden move toward hybrids by all automakers makes really good sense, I only wish they poured the billions of dollars into hybrids and plug-in hybrids instead of all-electric vehicles.

GM’s $1.6 billion loss is a reminder that even well-intentioned revolutions can get ahead of themselves. Electric vehicles are part of the future, but not the whole future. The goal should never be to push people into a product before they’re ready for it. It should be to make that product good enough—and affordable enough—that they want it on their own.

I’ve talked on air for a number of years about the future losses electric cars would cause. Not because of the cars themselves, but because automakers and our own government was shoving them down our throats. General Motors was the first to fess up to jumping the gun, but there are many more billions of dollars in red ink coming. Who knows the full impact? I certainly don’t, but over 10 billion would not be a surprise. Keep in mind, there have already been billions of dollars of losses written off each quarter over the past decade. Let that sink in.

Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy – $1.69 billion","Last week, the U.S. Department of Energy pulled the plug on billions of dollars’ worth of funding designated for advanced manufacturing, grid modernization, community resiliency hubs, academic institutions, and various clean energy and efficiency initiatives. These cuts are in addition to 321 financial awards supporting 223 projects that were set adrift on October 2.

The implications are grave for domestic supply chain revitalization efforts and even more so for ratepayers. Major automakers will have to find another way to advance electric vehicle (EV) production, American companies will be forced to rely on foreign supply, and utilities must rethink how they’ll pay for desperately-needed updates to aging electric infrastructure.

Environmental group Sierra Club’s Jeremy Fisher has assembled a visualization of the latest DOE cuts and sorted them by funding office. The October 7 decision to cut about 600 infrastructure projects slashed roughly $15.5 billion total in federal spending, another $13.3 billion in matching state funds, and all but assured the wipeout of billions in corresponding private investments.

The Biggest Cuts and Who They Hurt Most

Major automakers and suppliers are facing the most painful project cuts, mostly targeted toward EV and battery manufacturing. Fiat Chrysler is losing out on $530 million in federal funding for EV factories in Illinois and Indiana. General Motors is forgoing $500 million for new electric motor factories in Michigan, Kansas, and Kentucky. Volvo ($208 million, North Carolina) and Harley-Davidson ($89 million, Pennsylvania) are also drawing short straws.

Grid modernization plans made by utilities and state commissions, both large and small, are on the DOE’s chopping block, including $630.6 million set to go to the California Energy Commission (CEC) for reconductoring more than 100 miles of transmission lines and building others, $464.5 million designated for Minnesota’s Department of Commerce to improve grid interconnection, and $249.1 million intended for the Georgia Environmental Finance Authority to address reliability and resiliency concerns in disadvantaged areas.

“These projects are critical not only to the communities and jobs that they serve, but are core to a robust supply chain to keep prices – and emissions – low for consumers and businesses. This kind of federal funding is the stuff that actually makes things work,” stated Fisher, Principal Advisor on climate and energy with the Sierra Club’s Environmental Law Program. “Investments in our economy drive new industries, drive American innovation, and keep our economy competitive. Slashing these programs is a relatively small short-term gain for a huge long-term loss.”

Why do we need a Complete Streets ordinance?
Let’s work together to improve the quality of life and safety for everyone in our community through an honest and open discussion and work toward passing a Complete Streets Ordinance.","We all want and deserve to live in safe, healthy communities. Complete Streets policies make communities and neighborhoods more livable by ensuring all people can get safely to where they need to go — work, school, the library, grocery stores, or parks. They also help people feel more connected to their neighbors, which improves quality of life.

Sounds like a great deal, right? Detroit has made an investment in complete streets through its Complete Streets team, which has a designated staff and works regularly on projects that make it safe for people to share the road with cars and trucks. But Detroit does not have a Complete Streets Ordinance, which would codify these policies and ensure the safety of everyone who uses the roads in our community.

Why does Detroit need Complete Streets?

• Detroit has disproportionately high rates of obesity, Type 2 diabetes, cancer and cardio-metabolic conditions, all of which have stress- and physical inactivity-related causes. By providing active transportation options like walking and biking, Complete Streets can improve physical and mental health.

• 22% of Detroit households don’t have vehicles, and the high cost of car ownership makes them unaffordable for many. Complete Streets provides more options for everyone to get where they need to go.

• Detroit has one of the highest pedestrian fatality rates among all U.S. cities. Factors have led to a major increase in road fatalities for motorists, bicyclists, and pedestrians. In recent years, these fatality numbers have continued to climb.

In addition, Complete Streets help reduce speeding without the need for police enforcement. They also improve economic development by making retail areas flourish through investments that make it easier for residents to access local businesses.

Why do we need a Complete Streets ordinance?

Our current administration, including the mayor and his administrative team, have done a great job of supporting complete streets projects that include sidewalks that connect to parks, public transportation and schools; roads that include designated and protected bike lanes; and streets that accommodate all people.

But what happens when there is a change in administration? How do we ensure that these policies — which help us safely be active and improve the quality of life for everyone — continue?

Several community organizations, including the Detroit Greenways Coalition and the American Heart Association, have tried to convince the Department of Public Works of the need for a Complete Streets ordinance, but without success.

That reluctance to codify this important policy need has been baffling many of us involved in the process. We know that there are fewer crashes involving walkers when streets have sidewalks. People, including parents with strollers, people with disabilities, children and older adults, need sidewalks and crosswalks to feel safe.

It is puzzling that a department charged with ensuring the safety of all who use the streets in our community would not want to discuss this important policy with community members.

Let’s work together to improve the quality of life and safety for everyone in our community through an honest and open discussion and work toward passing a Complete Streets Ordinance.

The round was led by Addition, with participation from returning investors including Trust Ventures, Valor Equity Partners, Thrive Capital, Lightspeed, Andreessen Horowitz, Altimeter, StepStone, Elad Gil, 137 Ventures, Terrain, and Waybury. New backers joining the round include Ribbit, CapitalG, Spark, BOND, Lowercarbon, Avenir, Glade Brook, Positive Sum, and 1789.

The funding will accelerate Base Power’s mission to modernize the U.S. energy system and make affordable, reliable power available to households nationwide.

As the country faces mounting challenges from an aging and unreliable electric grid, Base Power aims to reshape how Americans generate, store, and access electricity. The company operates a distributed energy platform that uses advanced storage technologies to supply dependable, low-cost power both to individual homes and the grid at large.

Since its founding in 2023, Base Power has quickly expanded its footprint, deploying more than 100 megawatt-hours (MWh) of residential battery capacity in less than two years. That achievement positions Base among the fastest-scaling distributed energy platforms in the United States.

The company’s growth has been driven by strong consumer demand, strategic partnerships with homebuilders like Lennar, and collaborations with progressive utilities. Base Power currently serves customers across Dallas–Fort Worth, Houston, and Austin, with plans to expand across the country.

To meet surging demand, Base is building its first U.S. manufacturing facility in downtown Austin at the site of the former Austin American-Statesman printing press. The plant will produce energy storage and power electronics equipment, marking a major investment in domestic manufacturing capacity.

Base Power also recently qualified for Texas’s Aggregated Distributed Energy Resource (ADER) program, which enables distributed batteries to be combined and bid directly into the state’s power grid. This innovation strengthens statewide grid reliability and generates new revenue streams, helping Base reduce electricity costs for homeowners while demonstrating that distributed energy assets can perform effectively at utility scale.

How the funding will be used: The company plans to continue expanding its infrastructure and workforce to meet growing nationwide energy needs. With this funding, Base Power aims to accelerate deployment, increase U.S.-based manufacturing, and scale production of its distributed storage systems — critical steps toward what the company describes as a new era of “energy abundance.”

KEY QUOTES:

“The chance to reinvent our power system comes once in a generation. The challenge ahead requires the best engineers and operators to solve it and we’re scaling the team to make our abundant energy future a reality.” Zach Dell, CEO and Co-founder, Base Power

“We’re building domestic manufacturing capacity for fixing the grid. The only way to add capacity to the grid is physically deploying hardware, and we need to make that here in the U.S., ourselves. This factory in Austin is our first, and we’re already planning for our second. We’re building the infrastructure, systems, tools, processes, supporting software, and team that’s reindustrializing America and reinventing the grid.”",https://cdn.pulse2.com/cdn/2025/10/Base-Power-Logo.jpeg,N,,2025-10-15 15:11:47.149240

> Veolia’s commitment to environmental security, sustainability and community support drives partnership with Louisiana’s largest community college and its average enrollment of 21,000 students at five campuses

Veolia, the world’s leading provider of water services and environmental solutions, and Delgado Community College, the largest community college in Louisiana, are launching a Workforce Development Internship Program to provide students with hands-on experience to help them obtain jobs and start careers in the wastewater treatment, sustainability and environmental sectors.

The program offers students the opportunity to work alongside Veolia's experienced professionals at the New Orleans East Bank and West Bank wastewater treatment facilities. The internships will prepare students to build strong careers while providing environmental security to hundreds of thousands of people in the region.

“Delgado Community College’s broad reach across greater New Orleans and its dynamic population of motivated students makes it a natural partner for Veolia, as we meet both the environmental and community needs of the people we serve,” said Joseph Tackett, Veolia’s CEO of Municipal Water Contract Operations in North America. “The water and wastewater industry faces a generational challenge to replenish its aging workforce at the same time it confronts unprecedented environmental changes and threats. Partnering with Delgado creates strong pathways for these students as well as for our environment.”

“Delgado looks forward to launching and growing this partnership with Veolia, which will place our students in a professional environment where they can learn and thrive,” said Dr. Larissa Littleton-Steib, Chancellor at Delgado Community College. “The internships will allow students to position themselves for sustainable careers upon graduation while providing critical workforce needs for the water and wastewater sectors.”

Internship program offers practical training and coaching

Delgado Community College serves an average of 21,000 students annually, and its graduates account for 1 of every 90 jobs in the New Orleans region. Delgado’s Workforce Development, which is collaborating with Veolia on the internships, works with business and industry partners to provide a variety of traditional and non-traditional educational opportunities to students. The initial cohort will provide internships to 15 students.

“The Veolia internships will benefit students enrolled in Delgado Community College’s Water and Wastewater Technology program, which equips students with the technical skills and environmental knowledge needed for careers in water treatment and sustainability,” said Dr. April Noble, Assistant Chair of Physical Science Director of Chemical Technology, and leader of the Water and Wastewater Technology Program at Delgado.

Delgado’s curriculum, paired with Veolia’s hands-on training, will provide students with real-world experience that prepares them for certification and employment in the vital water and wastewater sectors. These experiences will foster a deeper understanding of water industry practices, promote problem solving skills, and help students build relationships with water sector professionals.

Veolia continues to expand its workforce development footprint, targeting high school students and recent graduates, opportunity youth, technical and community colleges, universities and retired military members. In the 2024-25 school year, Veolia reached more than 55,000 students across its American municipal water operations, including educational tours for thousands of students and more than 2,000 classes taught. By building strong partnerships with school systems and non-profit organizations, Veolia is transforming workforce development and opening new career pathways for the next generation of the water workforce.

Veolia’s strategic GreenUp program to depollute, decarbonize and preserve resources inspires its comprehensive workforce development efforts across the United States, which provide outreach, training and support to help people find fulfilling careers in the water industry. Veolia programs offer specialized outreach to high school and college students as well as promising individuals who never received their degrees; retired military members entering the civilian workforce after serving their country; and people in underserved areas seeking good jobs that help their communities.

If you’re thinking about upgrading your home with solar panels, energy-efficient windows, or a new HVAC system, the clock is ticking. Two of America’s biggest eco-friendly tax credits — the Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit (EEHIC) and the Residential Clean Energy Credit (RCEC) — are set to expire on January 1, 2026, after the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBA).

Homeowners across the United States have a limited window to claim valuable federal energy tax credits. These incentives can save thousands of dollars on energy-efficient home upgrades. But the clock is ticking. All credits are set to expire on December 31, 2025.

The two main credits available are the Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit and the Residential Clean Energy Credit. Both are designed to encourage homeowners to reduce energy use and adopt clean energy solutions. These programs have been a major financial help to homeowners looking to make their homes more eco-friendly.

The Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit covers 30% of qualifying home improvement costs. This includes upgrades like insulation, energy-efficient windows, doors, and HVAC systems. Homeowners can claim up to $1,200 per year for general improvements. Specific upgrades, such as heat pumps and water heaters, have higher limits, reaching $2,000 per year.

Meanwhile, the Residential Clean Energy Credit offers a 30% tax credit for renewable energy installations. This includes solar panels, wind turbines, geothermal heat pumps, and battery storage systems. Unlike the home improvement credit, there is no annual or lifetime cap, making it a huge opportunity for homeowners investing in larger clean energy systems.

Both programs were first created under the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and later expanded through the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) under the Biden administration. The IRA extended these incentives to 2032, but the OBBA rolled back that timeline by six years — also ending the popular $7,500 electric vehicle tax credit.

Live Events

The goal of these credits is to reward homeowners for investing in energy-saving or renewable systems. That includes projects like:

Replacing old windows, doors, or insulation

Installing energy-efficient air conditioners or heat pumps

Adding solar panels, battery storage, or geothermal systems

Many homeowners are still unaware of these savings. Small projects like insulating your attic or replacing old windows can yield tax benefits. Larger projects, such as installing solar panels or geothermal systems, can provide thousands in savings. Acting before the deadline ensures that you can take full advantage.

These credits not only lower your tax bill but also improve home comfort. Energy-efficient upgrades reduce utility costs, help maintain stable indoor temperatures, and increase your property’s market value. They are investments that pay off in both savings and long-term sustainability.

To claim these credits, homeowners need to file IRS Form 5695 with their tax return. Keeping detailed records, including receipts and manufacturer certifications, is essential. Only improvements completed and installed before December 31, 2025, qualify for the credits.

These tax credits can make a serious dent in your tax bill:

The average EEHIC claim in 2023 was $880.

The average RCEC deduction reached about $5,000.

The EEHIC typically covers 30% of qualifying improvement costs, up to specific annual limits ($600 for windows, $500 for doors, $2,000 for heat pumps). The RCEC allows a similar 30% deduction for renewable energy systems such as solar, wind, and geothermal installations.

With less than three months remaining before the expiration, now is the time to plan and execute your upgrades. By acting quickly, homeowners can maximize savings, improve their homes, and contribute to a greener future. Missing the deadline could mean losing out on substantial financial benefits.

What home energy tax credits are expiring soon?

Homeowners have a limited time to take advantage of federal tax credits for energy-efficient home improvements and clean energy systems. These credits are set to expire on December 31, 2025.

The Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit and the Residential Clean Energy Credit can save you hundreds or even thousands of dollars. But if you delay, you may miss out entirely.

These credits are designed to encourage homeowners to make upgrades that reduce energy use. They also help lower your monthly utility bills while making your home more eco-friendly.

Many homeowners are unaware of the savings available. Acting now ensures you get the full benefit before the credits disappear at the end of the year.

How much can I save with the energy efficient home improvement credit?

The energy-efficient home improvement credit covers 30% of the cost of qualifying home improvements. This can include insulation, new windows, doors, and HVAC systems.

There are specific annual limits. You can claim up to $1,200 per year for general improvements. For certain high-efficiency upgrades like heat pumps, water heaters, and biomass stoves, you can claim up to $2,000 per year.

This means that if you plan carefully, you could save as much as $3,200 in a single year on eligible improvements. Small upgrades like insulation and new doors can make a difference, but larger systems like heat pumps can maximize your savings.

Claiming these credits also helps increase the value of your home. Energy-efficient upgrades are attractive to buyers and can make your home more comfortable and cost-efficient.

What counts for the residential clean energy credit?

The residential clean energy credit provides a 30% tax credit for installing renewable energy systems. This includes solar panels, solar water heaters, wind turbines, geothermal heat pumps, and battery storage systems.

Unlike the home improvement credit, there is no annual or lifetime cap on this credit. You can claim 30% of the total cost, which can amount to thousands of dollars depending on the system you install.

This credit encourages homeowners to adopt clean energy solutions that reduce reliance on traditional energy sources. Solar panels, for example, not only save money on electricity bills but also reduce your carbon footprint.

If you are planning a major upgrade like solar or geothermal systems, now is the perfect time to act. The full credit is available only for projects installed before the end of 2025.

How do I claim these tax credits?

Claiming energy tax credits is straightforward if you follow the steps carefully. First, make sure your improvements are installed and in use before December 31, 2025. Only completed and operational systems qualify.

Next, file IRS Form 5695 with your tax return for the year the improvements were made. This form reports the cost of your energy-efficient or clean energy upgrades.

It’s essential to keep detailed records. Save receipts, manufacturer certifications, and installation dates for every qualifying improvement. These documents may be required if the IRS asks for verification.

Complete your project before Dec. 31, 2025. Only improvements placed in service by this date qualify.

Save your receipts and manufacturer certifications. You’ll need proof of energy efficiency and installation costs.

File IRS Form 5695 (“Residential Energy Credits”) when submitting your federal tax return for the year you completed the work.

Claim 30% of eligible costs on your return — but remember, these are non-refundable credits, meaning they can reduce your tax bill but won’t trigger a refund beyond your owed taxes.

Following these steps carefully ensures you maximize your savings and avoid errors that could delay your refund or reduce your credit.

Who is eligible for these credits?

The credits are available only for your primary residence. Vacation homes or rental properties do not qualify.

The credits are nonrefundable, meaning they can reduce your tax bill to zero but will not generate a refund beyond what you owe. You also cannot carry forward unused credits to future years.

Certain improvements require a Qualified Manufacturer Identification Number (QMID). This applies to heat pumps, biomass stoves, and some water heaters. Make sure to include the QMID on your tax forms to avoid problems with your claim.

These rules are in place to ensure only eligible homeowners benefit from the program. Double-check each item before claiming the credit.

Why should I act now to get these credits?

With the deadline approaching, now is the best time to plan and install your energy-efficient upgrades. Waiting until next year will mean losing these tax-saving opportunities.

Making upgrades now allows you to save money on taxes, lower your utility bills, and increase your home’s energy efficiency. Small upgrades, like sealing air leaks or upgrading insulation, can make an immediate difference.

For larger projects, like solar panels or geothermal systems, acting now ensures you capture the maximum credit before the program expires. Homeowners who wait risk missing out entirely.

Upgrading your home before the end of 2025 is also a step toward a more sustainable lifestyle, helping reduce your environmental impact.

How can I maximize my savings?

To get the most from these credits, combine multiple qualifying improvements. For example, pair new insulation with a heat pump or add solar panels alongside energy-efficient windows.

Plan your projects so that all systems are installed and operational before December 31, 2025. This ensures full credit eligibility.

Keep careful records of every improvement, including receipts, certifications, and installation dates. Accurate documentation is essential for a smooth tax filing process.

Consider consulting a tax professional if you have multiple improvements or larger projects. They can help you calculate your total credit and ensure you claim every eligible dollar.

RTI had grant and contract terminations totaling $1.2 billion according to DOGE data, the study notes.
RTI accounted for more than two-thirds of that total, the report notes.
The contract terminations have prompted three rounds of layoffs, affecting more than a third of its workforce, the report notes.
The largest RTI grant detailed by DOGE was a $95 million grant to “identify and support underserved communities in desperate need of environmental assistance,” the report notes.","The Trump Administration’s decision to roll back federal spending on science and medical studies has affected many U.S. research institutions, but the impact on Durham-based Research Triangle Institute “is in a category of its own,” according to a new study.

In the administration’s first seven months, RTI received notice that 57 research grants and 52 contracts were terminated, according to the study by Harris Search Associates, a Columbus, Ohio-based executive search and consulting firm that specializes in higher education. No other institution had more than eight cancellations.

Harris studied the effects of cancellations at 76 members of the Association of Independent Research Institutes, which include St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee, the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center in Seattle and the Scripps Research Institute in San Diego. Each suffered from one to eight grant terminations in a process led by the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, which the Trump Administration directed to ferret out waste and fraud.

RTI had grant and contract terminations totaling $1.2 billion according to DOGE data, the study notes.

Overall, DOGE’s online database shows 18 members of the research institution trade group had experienced at least one federal grant or contract termination, with overall savings of $1.65 billion. RTI accounted for more than two-thirds of that total, the report notes.

The accuracy of DOGE’s statistics have been challenged by many groups, which contend savings from cuts are exaggerated. But the real world impact on RTI is clear.

“Since its creation back in the late 1950s as an anchor to Research Triangle Park, RTI was buoyed by this narrative that science and logic and a can-do spirit can solve vexing problems here and abroad, says Jon Schwantes, a Harris senior consultant who worked on the study. “But they were in the wrong place at the wrong time.”

RTI celebrated its 60th anniversary in 2023 with more than 6,000 employees in 90-plus countries, including about 2,000 in the Triangle. The contract terminations have prompted three rounds of layoffs, affecting more than a third of its workforce, the report notes.

The key factor is that RTI hitched its wagon to the US Agency for International Development, or USAID, receiving $2.3 billion between 2013-22, ranking sixth among all agency grantees, Schwantes says. That included $219 million in 2024, more than any other group except for Catholic Relief Services and Durham-based FHI 360, formerly called Family Health International, Harris said in its report.

But on his first day in office, President Donald Trump suspended all foreign aid for 90 days, and showed particular rancor towards USAID, which was formed in 1961 in the Kennedy Administration.

Beyond its reliance on USAID, RTI’s other challenge was its involvement in many programs that could be perceived as woke,” Schwantes says. Those include projects involving gun violence, tobacco usage, environmental justice, carbon capture and many other topics. The largest RTI grant detailed by DOGE was a $95 million grant to “identify and support underserved communities in desperate need of environmental assistance,” the report notes.

Harris didn’t have an agenda in producing the report, Schwates says. “Our intent is to bring clarity to a subject that has not received the kind of attention it deserves.”

RTI CEO Tim Gabel has said the group is working to diversify its portfolio, including more projects in healthcare and defense.",https://images.businessnc.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/BusinessNC_2021_logo_orange.jpg,N,,2025-10-15 13:10:44.919201

""We need to fix charging to sell EVs, to take internal combustion engine cars off the road over time and avoid emissions,"" Buckberg said.
Realities for drivers According to Buckberg, most electric vehicles on the market have a range of 230 miles or more on a single charge.
According to Buckberg, this investment is crucial to increasing the share of EVs on the road and reaping the environmental benefits.
""It's a really cheap option at a time where we've got pullback of federal incentives that would raise the number of registered EVs.""","Compared to gasoline-powered cars, electric vehicles can save money at the pump, produce less harmful emissions, and avoid high maintenance costs. Why then, are so few Americans switching to EVs? The main reason, according to Elaine Buckberg, senior fellow at Harvard's Salata Institute for Climate and Sustainability, is the hassle of charging on the go.

In a recent talk at Harvard Kennedy School, Buckberg, a former chief economist for General Motors, explored the realities of commuting with an electric vehicle, and why the lack of charging infrastructure is preventing the shift in consumer behavior needed to reduce transportation emissions.

Transportation accounts for 28% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, and light-duty vehicles like passenger cars account for a total of 17%.

""We need to fix charging to sell EVs, to take internal combustion engine cars off the road over time and avoid emissions,"" Buckberg said.

Realities for drivers

According to Buckberg, most electric vehicles on the market have a range of 230 miles or more on a single charge. For most Americans, that's an average week of driving.

But consumers aren't thinking about their daily, or even weekly, habits when considering making the switch to an electric vehicle, said Buckberg. What car buyers want is a vehicle that can reliably take them on a cross-country trip should the need arise.

""What if some weekend, they needed to take both kids and drop them off in different places, one at a soccer match and one had, I don't know, dance competition, and they were both long-distance,"" she said. ""That might be a problem.""

At present, Buckberg said, most EV owners are also homeowners with access to at-home charging. But public infrastructure—which would be crucial to expanding EV ownership—is still spotty.

""So people who can't charge at home, or maybe can't also charge in their workplace, they're really going to rely on public charging,"" she said. ""That's generally city dwellers and renters.""

Publicly available chargers—including both Level 2, which take roughly three to five hours to reach a full charge, and fast chargers that can reach a nearly full charge in around 20 minutes—currently sit at around 61,000 across the country, according to Buckberg. That's up from 46,000 last year.

""But not nearly keeping up with the stock of EVs,"" she added.

For comparison, there are more than double the amount of gas-fueling stations in the U.S.—many with multiple pumps for use.

Buckberg added that there is little reliability in a charger working, and a lack of real-time data for drivers. According to her research, only 34% of charging stations share real-time data that apps like Chargepoint and PlugShare use to inform their users on where to plug in. On some of the highways her team has studied, the gaps in available data exceed 1,300 miles.

""There's no one-stop app to find chargers, which means it can be hard to find out whether a charger is working,"" she said. ""Who's responsible? Who do you tell when it's broken? So they don't get fixed.""

Potential policy solutions

Currently, the federal government is not prioritizing increasing EV purchasing, as has been a trend in recent years, she said. It has cut incentive programs, including tax credits and spending programs, to improve availability of real-time charger data for drivers.

According to Buckberg, this investment is crucial to increasing the share of EVs on the road and reaping the environmental benefits. Her research shows that universal real-time data on highway fast chargers would raise new EV sales by 6.4 percentage points in 2030—or 3.5 million additional EVs on the road in 2030 compared to the status quo. That would grow the overall share of EVs on the road by 15% and in turn create a reduction in emissions of about 15 million metric tons, she said.

""Data transparency could cure range anxiety,"" she said in her talk. ""Imagine that you could go to Google Maps, you could go to Apple Maps, you could go to whatever is the killer new EV app, and you could get reliable information.""

But there is still hope, she said. In partnership with scholars Ari Peskoe, Carrie Jenks, and Eliza Martin at Harvard Law School, Buckberg's team has developed example legislation for state governments that would establish common standards for EV-charging providers to increase the reliability of their data.

""No expensive federal investment or tax credits,"" she said. ""It's a really cheap option at a time where we've got pullback of federal incentives that would raise the number of registered EVs.""

And, Buckberg said, having states take the lead would reduce resistance for charging providers that have not made sharing data a priority.

""From a state perspective, this could be justified because it yields benefits at very low cost,"" she said.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2025/want-americans-to-love.jpg,N,,2025-10-15 16:09:29.736000

Stellantis plans to invest $13 billion in the U.S. over the next four years to increase domestic finished vehicle production by 50% over current levels and boost its market share, per an Oct. 14 press release.

The plans involve launching five new vehicles in key segments, including production of a new 4-cylinder engine. The automaker’s manufacturing investments will add over 5,000 new jobs across four of its factories in Illinois, Ohio, Michigan and Indiana.

“This investment in the U.S. — the single largest in the Company’s history — will drive our growth, strengthen our manufacturing footprint and bring more American jobs to the states we call home,” Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa said in a statement.

Dive Insight:

As part of the $13 billion investment, Stellantis plans to launch 19 refreshed products across all of its U.S. manufacturing facilities through 2029, including models with updated powertrains.

“As we begin our next 100 years, we are putting the customer at the center of our strategy, expanding our vehicle offerings and giving them the freedom to choose the products they want and love,” Filosa said in a statement.

Stellantis plans to invest more than $600 million to reopen its shuttered Belvidere Assembly Plant in Illinois to expand production of the Jeep Cherokee and Jeep Compass SUVs for the U.S. market. The Belvidere facility is expected to add roughly 3,300 jobs and begin producing the first vehicles in 2027. Stellantis closed the Illinois factory in February 2023 as part of a cost-cutting move, but in September told WardsAuto that it had plans to reopen the plant.

In Ohio, the automaker plans to invest $400 million in its Toledo Assembly Complex to build an all-new mid-size pickup. Production is scheduled to start in 2028 and expected to create around 900 jobs. The Ohio factory will also produce the Jeep Wrangler and Gladiator.

In Michigan, Stellantis is investing $100 million to retool its Warren Truck Assembly Plant to produce an all-new range-extended EV and a new full-size SUV with an internal combustion engine. Production is expected to start in 2028. The plant currently produces the Jeep Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer.

The automaker unveiled the redesigned 2026 Grand Wagoneer this week, which is being offered with two powertrain options, a range-extended version and a model equipped with the automaker’s 3.0-liter Hurricane twin-turbo engine.

Stellantis also plans to invest $130 million to prepare its Detroit Assembly Complex to build the next-generation Dodge Durango SUV. Production is expected to begin in 2029.

Meanwhile, in Indiana, Stellantis will begin producing a new 4-cylinder engine at its Kokomo plant beginning in 2026. The automaker is investing over $100 million in the factory to produce the engine, which is expected to add over 100 jobs.

The $13 billion investment announcement comes as Stellantis works to regain its footing in 2025 following significant revenue declines in 2024.

In July, the automaker reported that its first half revenues fell 13% compared to the same period last year, resulting in an operating loss of 2.3 billion euros. The company’s net revenue for the first six months of 2025 also fell to 74.3 billion euros, which it largely blamed on sales declines and loss of market share in North America and Europe.

But the company has been working on its turnaround plans since appointing Antonio Filosa as its new CEO on June 23. He succeeded Carlos Tavares, who resigned in December 2024 amid declining sales and profits. Filosa announced a new leadership team on the same day, made up of executives who he said “bring an entrepreneurial spirit and profound understanding of the company’s brands.”

Stellantis currently operates 34 manufacturing facilities, distribution centers, and research and development sites in the U.S., which together support over 48,000 employees, according to the release.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/H-lfd0Xzogm-CtpcMmY-RtqA9uD_RZvBPBR2MeF86w8/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS85M2VhYjVkMDg3NjZlMGI0ZmUzY2ZkNWU5MDE0ZTgwMS53ZWJw.webp,N,,2025-10-15 14:04:10.116021

Taking a page from Starlink satellites, the chargers include software to let chargers self-identify and fix faults remotely.
Efficient EV Charging Transformers EV drivers have seen the hulking green transformer boxes that supply stations, including ones with roughly 1,000 kilovolt-amperes, the unit that describes a system’s total electrical power.
The latter results in “demand charges” that are a notorious obstacle to a profitable, sustainable EV charging business.
And that can translate to more-reasonable prices for drivers, Lee says.","As a young SpaceX engineer, Quincy Lee led a rollout of hundreds of terrestrial antennas for Elon Musk’s Starlink Internet service. The project covered three continents, took just 24 months—and turned out to be great preparation for Lee’s next chapter.

Lee, now the founder and CEO of Electric Era, wants to make EV charging faster, ubiquitous, and more affordable for drivers and for retailers looking to lure customers and still turn a profit on electricity. As part of that, the company today announced its second-generation RetailEdge chargers. The sleek DC chargers can deliver up to 400 kilowatts, on par with the most-powerful public chargers in America. But for the Seattle-based company, the real innovation is stationary power storage, something you won’t find at any charger from top players such as Tesla, Electrify America, or Ionna.

The RetailEdge stations can amass 370 kilowatt-hours of storage for a station with eight customer stalls. Taking a page from Starlink satellites, the chargers include software to let chargers self-identify and fix faults remotely. Backed by a box full of prismatic LFP batteries, sourced from China, the company’s chargers can deliver roughly four times as much power as what’s actually being supplied by the grid itself. Lee calls that a potential game-changer for an aging, overmatched electrical grid that was not built for a world in which millions of drivers would demand access to industrial-level juice.

“A simple way to think about it is, a typical charging station consumes 1,000 homes’ worth of power on a city block. We can take that down to about 300 homes,” Lee says, while still delivering charging speeds that rival the industry’s best.

Efficient EV Charging Transformers

EV drivers have seen the hulking green transformer boxes that supply stations, including ones with roughly 1,000 kilovolt-amperes, the unit that describes a system’s total electrical power. In contrast, Electric Era stations use smaller, circular transformers—think the ones hung from telephone poles in residential neighborhoods—that can cost as little as US $16,000. (those beefier units can cost up to $100,000.) That makes for faster permitting and grid upgrades, a potential end-run around construction snafus that can delay DC projects, with some taking more than two years to complete

“The transformers are cheaper, easier to source, and take up less space,” Lee says. “We can swap larger pieces of power conversion equipment for smaller ones, and still serve up to 140 charging sessions a day for our midsized stations.”

With nearly 120 of its first-generation, 200-kilowatt DC chargers currently in the ground for customers including Costco and Shell, Electric Era says it can decrease installation times and costs by roughly a factor of four. Projects are going from contract to completion in six to nine months on average, and some in as little as two to three months.

For its midsize stations with four charging stalls, the company needs only 370 kilovolt-amperes of installed capacity, about one-third that of some typical DC stations. (The kVa figure describes total apparent power, the product of a circuit’s maximum voltage and current.) The rest is supplied by 220 kilowatt-hours of stationary battery storage, barely more than the 205 kilowatt-hours found in a Cadillac Escalade IQ or GMC Hummer EV.

As drivers plug in, the system automatically balances power between grid and battery supplies. EVs get all the juice they can handle, with stations able to operate 24/7 without any significant curtailment of power.

“Most EVs are only accepting peak power for a few minutes, so we can then use intelligent load management to service another car, and power all the cars at the right time,” Lee says.

Electricity becomes dramatically cheaper as well. Utility customers pay for both electricity they actually use, and the infrastructure wiring that guarantees a ready supply at peak demand. The latter results in “demand charges” that are a notorious obstacle to a profitable, sustainable EV charging business. The higher the ultimate capacity, the higher the charges, even when no car is actually filling up.

“That makes the economics much easier to pencil,” Lee says. “Our customers’ electricity charges are about 50 percent lower, because of demand-charge savings.”

AI-Driven Cost Savings for EV Stations

The company says its system, backed by an AI platform and an intuitive, voice-based screen assistant that can operate in multiple languages, can reduce retail operator costs by up to 70 percent. And that can translate to more-reasonable prices for drivers, Lee says. A 2024 Harvard Business School study of EV charging that analyzed 1 million consumer reviews of charging experiences around the United States showed that “Wild West” pricing, and a lack of pricing transparency, are major sources of frustration for drivers.

Or don’t ask Harvard: At many Electrify America stations, such as one near me in Providence, R.I., drivers pay up to 64 cents per kilowatt-hour. The cost of convenience is daunting: According to an EV calculator, at those prices, a driver would spend roughly $3,000 a year for enough juice to cover 15,000 miles in a Hyundai Ioniq5 SUV. At current prices for regular unleaded, a driver would spend only $1,600 to drive the same distance in a model that gets 30 miles per gallon (about 13 kilometers per liter).

At Electric Era stations, where retailers set their own prices, customers pay about 45 cents per kilowatt-hour on average, about one-third less than many EA stations.

As EVs proliferate, more retailers are seeing the long-predicted upside of luring customers with electricity. A captive charging audience will hopefully spend money at the business, whether it’s a gas station, convenience store, restaurant, or shopping mall.

“For years, that didn’t work, because there were too few EVs on the road,” Lee says. “But the calculus is shifting, and retailers are putting real estate aside (for chargers).”

The company claims a 99.8-percent uptime, and a 93-percent reliability rate, meaning seven percent of people who plug in fail to get a charge for any reason, from payment glitches to user error. The same Harvard study posted a troubling 78-percent reliability score for public charging, meaning about one in five charging attempts ended in failure.

As Lee says, “One of the things we learned at SpaceX is that you can’t send a repair truck to space, and we’ve adopted the same methodology.”",https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/image.jpg?id=61747215&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C497%2C0%2C453,N,,2025-10-15 17:09:46.768481

In the early 2000s, blackouts rocked California. More than two dozen of them in total.

""It's still debated to this day what happened,"" said Andy Campbell, the executive director of the Energy Institute at Haas at UC Berkeley. ""A lot of things happened, but a key enabler of the energy crisis were actions of the California legislature.""

Campbell works with a dozen energy and environmental economists, researching the energy of the future — which sometimes requires examining the past.

""Laws were passed in the mid-1990s. There was sort of a desire at that time to try to reform the way the energy business was structured,"" Campbell said. ""There were several large vertically integrated utilities. The same company owned all the power plants, they owned all the transmission lines, they owned all the distribution lines. There was sort of a desire to see if there's a different way of doing things.""

According to Campbell, a major problem was the state legislature passed laws requiring buyers of electricity to buy all of their electricity on a real-time basis.

""They just had to buy energy at the price that was available at the point in time they bought it,"" Campbell said.

This left open the possibility for bad actors to game California's energy system by causing supply and demand issues. When demand outpaces supply, the grid becomes strained, and without any additional energy to make up the difference, major outages can occur. And in 2000 and 2001, they did.

""Enron was not the only one, but Enron was the biggest one to basically manipulate the market,"" Campbell said. ""They'd (Enron) basically tell the grid operator, 'Oh sorry, my power plant is broken. There's a problem with the power plant, it's down.' Prices would spike. Enron had some other power plants. They're now selling energy at those very high prices.""

During the energy crisis, some of the state’s biggest investor-owned utilities — such as Pacific Gas and Electric — went bankrupt. The state legislature passed several emergency bills, with the primary goal of stabilizing the grid. And in an effort to avoid a similar crisis in the future, California began taking more active roles in planning new power generation and transmission lines.

""Our job is to keep the lights on,"" said Elliot Mainzer, speaking from an observation room above the control room floor of the California Independent System Operator, better known as CAISO.

""I like to sometimes say that we're sort of a combination of a control tower operator and the NASDAQ,"" said Mainzer, the president and CEO of CAISO. ""We have the responsibility of overseeing the flow of electricity across the high voltage transmission system in California and making sure that there's a constant balance of supply and demand. We're constantly taking bids for supply and demand and balancing the system at the lowest possible cost, both within the state of California and administer a market that covers about 80% of the Western United States.""

CAISO plays a role somewhat like an air traffic controller for a power grid that includes most of Arizona, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Washington and Wyoming — and of course, all of California.

""All of this requires a lot of coordination, a lot of collaboration, and a lot of synchronization to make sure we accomplish all these functions efficiently,"" Mainzer said. ""California is sitting on a very healthy, pretty balanced portfolio, and I think part of our challenge in the years ahead is to continue to work with our energy planners to make sure that we have that portfolio that is cleaner and cleaner and cleaner over the years.""

A big player in California's energy portfolio is Pacific Gas and Electric. PG&E is one of the state’s — and the country’s — largest utility companies.

""We have really strong partnerships with California ISO,"" said Quinn Nakayama, PG&E's senior director of Grid Innovation, Research, and Development. He was speaking in front of one of his company's recently upgraded substations in Sutter County.

""We partner very closely together around where are our major load growths are going towards,"" Nakayama said. ""And then we work together to say, well, which of these assets need to then be built out to accommodate that load?""

And a lot more load is expected. Over the next 20 years, PG&E is forecasting an increase of 70%.

""As all these industries continue to develop and rise, and especially with data centers which have significant amounts of power draw with things like artificial intelligence now becoming a real big thing here in California, we're having to build out infrastructure,"" Nakayama said. ""We can't get away from the build, but where we want to do innovation is in areas where maybe we don't need to build as much.""

""One great example is that we have a technology called smart wires or smart valves,"" Nakayama said.

He shared an example with cars and freeways.

""You have the 80 freeway and the 50 freeway, and these two freeways feed Sacramento to be able to take people from the outer areas into Sacramento,"" Nakayama said. ""Maybe too many people are driving on the 80 freeway and not enough people are driving on the 50 freeway. And more people are trying to drive on the 80 freeway, and now you're needing to build out new infrastructure for the 80 to accommodate all these new people.""

""But if I'm able to take those cars and push them to the 50 freeway and not cause problems, then now I can share the load between these freeways and still feed all of Sacramento,"" Nakayama said. ""To be able to help them grow Sacramento area, while at the same time not having to build another freeway. We're doing the same thing here in our substations.""

It's not all just about upgrades. Being smarter about how the grid distributes power is part of it too.

""When the air conditioning is running, maybe I don't want to charge my car as fast. If we can figure out how to modulate this type of stuff, so it doesn't all need to suck up as much energy all at the same time, all the time, we might not have to upgrade all of our systems to be able to accommodate that,"" Nakayama said.

""If we can do that while not impacting our customers – like, I need to get my car charged at 6 o'clock in the morning – as long as I don't impact that, maybe we can create an environment where we'll be willing to work in that energy ecosystem and then I don't have to do those upgrades, that doesn't have to appear on your bill and everybody saves money,"" Nakayama said. ""That's the beautiful thing about innovation, what we're looking to try to do.""

California has been innovating in other ways too.

""We've done a lot of work to coordinate and anticipate issues, and we've really been able to ride through some pretty hot events here in California without having to call on Flex Alerts,"" Mainzer said.

Flex Alerts were created and first issued in California during the 2000-2001 energy crisis. They are a measure of last resort, calling on Californians to conserve power to avoid rolling blackouts as demand outpaces supply.

""The number of days of the year that we're going to call on these are going to be relatively modest, but it makes a big difference if consumers in relatively large numbers take modest steps to flex their demand for a few hours,"" Mainzer said. ""Particularly that 4 p.m. to 9 p.m. period is the time of day when demand can still be very high, and of course, as the sun starts to set and our solar energy resources start to reduce the amount of power. That can become a strained period on the grid.""

Flex Alerts are instances of true grid shortages, where all available resources are utilized but aren’t enough to meet the demand. California hasn’t had a Flex Alert issued since September 2022, when much of the state saw all-time record heat but no blackouts — thanks in large part to more battery storage.

""Back in 2020, we only had about 200 megawatts of batteries on our grid. In the last 4 or 5 years, we've now got almost 13,000 megawatts of batteries on our system. It's made a huge difference,"" Mainzer said.

It also helps to have a power grid that is bigger than the weather, something Mainzer often says. By connecting to other states in the west, CAISO can send power from typically cooler states – like Idaho or Washington – to California during the summer to meet increased demand. And during the winter, California can send excess power up north.

""We have a grid that's bigger than the weather,"" Mainzer said. ""We have huge amount of transmission that connects up to the hydro resources in the Pacific Northwest. We've got transmission resources that go out into the Desert Southwest all the way out into the Intermountain West. We're also engaged in the construction of some big new transmission lines that will further open up into New Mexico, up into Wyoming, and all the way across Nevada up into Idaho that will give California additional access to clean energy resources, create some additional opportunities for us to export surplus and will strengthen the foundation of our regional energy market.""

All of this is just part of meeting California's clean energy goal.

""We are continually looking for new technologies and new energy procurements to get us to a net zero energy system by 2045,"" Nakayama said.

Chapter 3: Can California Build to a Carbon-Free Future?

California’s goal of reaching 100% carbon-free energy by 2045 depends on a delicate balance — generating enough clean, reliable power to meet a rapidly growing demand while keeping costs affordable for residents and businesses.

High in the Sierra Nevada, a network of lakes and reservoirs powers communities far below. The Sacramento Municipal Utility District (SMUD) operates 12 reservoirs and nine powerhouses that not only provide recreation and wildlife habitat but also supply hydropower to the Sacramento area.

“Hydropower is a tried and true method going back to the 1800s — spinning a wheel with water,” said Darold Perry of SMUD. “It provides about 20% of our energy needs in an average year. It can go higher in wetter years, and it allows us to provide reliable, affordable energy.”

The district’s hydroelectric system, built in the 1950s and 1960s, has evolved from providing steady “baseline” power to delivering more energy during peak afternoon and evening hours when demand and prices rise.

“Our hydrogeneration portfolio is critical for SMUD’s 2030 zero-carbon initiative,” said Dan Strickland, adding that the plan is among the most aggressive in the country. “We want to keep our rates as low as possible for all Sacramento ratepayers.”

California’s broader clean-energy goals mirror that ambition. SMUD aims to go 100% renewable by 2030, while the state’s target is a carbon-free grid by 2045.

Much of that push is powered by the sun. Nearly 2 million homes in California now generate solar electricity, helping make it cheaper and more abundant. This year, solar energy became the state’s largest source of power, surpassing natural gas and supplying more than one-third of California’s total energy.

The growth of solar has created a new challenge known as the “duck curve.” During daylight hours, energy demand dips as solar production peaks, then it surges again in the late afternoon as the sun sets and air conditioners and appliances switch on.

To meet those needs, California is fast-tracking massive new solar and storage projects. The Darden Clean Energy Project in Fresno County will use more than 3 million solar panels and batteries to power 850,000 homes. The Cornucopia Hybrid Project is expected to supply energy for up to 300,000 homes.

Innovation continues at the local level, too. The Turlock Irrigation District received a $20 million state grant to install solar panels over irrigation canals, an experiment designed to both generate power and reduce water evaporation.

“We’re the oldest irrigation district but trying new things is in our DNA,” said TID spokesperson Josh Weimer. “We say yes to projects. We look at different solutions for the challenges ahead of us.

If successful, the canal project could eventually expand to sections of the California Aqueduct.

“It’s a potential solution, because we’re going to need all options on the table to reach a 100% carbon-free grid by 2045,” Weimer said.

Wind power is another major piece of the state’s clean-energy equation. California’s wind industry began in the 1980s in the Altamont Pass, but stronger and steadier winds blow offshore along the coast. Proposed offshore projects near Humboldt and Morro Bay have drawn pushback from fishermen and coastal residents worried about environmental and economic impacts.

“We don’t know what the cumulative impacts will be — not just on fisheries but on the entire marine ecosystem,” said Mike Conroy of West Coast Fisheries Consultants. “If we’re going to do this, let’s do it right.”

Despite the challenges, energy experts say California continues to break ground on renewable milestones.

“Last year alone, California’s grid ran on 100% clean energy for the equivalent of 51 full days,” said Alex Jackson with the American Clean Power Association. “If trends hold, that number could rise to 80 days this year.”

Stanford researchers project the state could operate on 100% renewable energy around the clock by 2033.

Just last month, California compiled data from 2023 and found that 67% of its energy came from renewable sources, breaking the record for the third straight year.

Current challenges from federal funding of renewable projects may temporarily slow or stop some projects in the near future, but many existing projects are currently in the planning or construction phases. Renewable energy sources in many cases provide the cheapest and fastest source of new energy even without subsidies from government grants.",https://media.abc10.com/assets/KXTV/images/decdd2e5-bea9-486e-bbf5-ad3f29fa5d64/20251002T173517/decdd2e5-bea9-486e-bbf5-ad3f29fa5d64_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-10-15 18:11:42.072976

MADISON — Gov. Tony Evers sent a letter amid reports that the Trump Administration plans to terminate over 600 U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) funding awards, including more than $1.5 billion in approved funding to Wisconsin-based companies and organizations or projects located in Wisconsin with energy-related goals and objectives. In a letter to DOE Secretary Chris Wright, Gov. Evers noted that terminating these funding awards at a time of record-high energy demand and rising costs would be “counterintuitive, reckless, and ill-advised.”

This letter comes as the governor recently highlighted that efforts by President Trump and Republicans in Congress to roll back clean energy investments will cause the average household energy costs across the U.S. to increase by an additional $170 annually over the next decade, according to a recent analysis by Energy Innovation. In Wisconsin alone, Wisconsinites will face a $300 annual increase on household energy bills due to the actions of the Trump Administration by 2035.

Among the Wisconsin-based projects, companies, and organizations facing terminated funding, totaling over $1.5 billion, include:

Honeywell International Inc. – $123.8 million

Slipstream Group Inc. – $5.1 million

Johnson Controls Inc. – $33 million

A.O. Smith Corporation – $25 million

Slipstream Group Inc. – $2.8 million

Wisconsin Regional Training Partnership Inc. – $1.5 million

A copy of the governor’s letter to U.S. DOE Secretary Wright is available here, and a transcript of the letter is available below.

Dear Secretary Wright:

I am writing to express my concern regarding potential terminations of U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) funding awards to entities and businesses in Wisconsin and to urge the Trump Administration to reconsider any plans to terminate these awards. Federal support plays a critical role in advancing the Wisconsin Idea and American innovation, lowering energy bills for families across America, supporting clean energy development to improve energy independence and resilience, creating good-paying jobs in innovative industries and sectors, and maintaining our nation’s leadership in science and technology.

Given these clear benefits and the importance of these investments to Wisconsin’s and our nation’s economy, I was deeply concerned to see reporting last week containing a list of over 600 DOE funding awards that are potentially going to be targeted for termination with no clear reasoning or justification.

From that list, awards to Wisconsin-based companies and organization or projects located partially or fully in Wisconsin total over $1.5 billion alone.

The funding awards in question span across multiple programs with multiple energy-related goals and objectives. For example, multiple funding awards to Wisconsin entities through the Grid Resilience and Innovation Partnerships (GRIP) Program are targeted for termination. The GRIP Program is designed to enhance grid flexibility and improve the resilience of power systems against extreme weather. Terminating this funding will harm Wisconsinites and leave communities more susceptible to power outages and more costly repairs from future extreme weather events.

In addition, the list includes multiple funding awards to Slipstream Inc., a Wisconsin-based organization, to help communities implement energy-saving power systems in buildings. These technologies reduce energy use and lower energy bills, both of which are critical in this moment as we are seeing record-high energy demand and folks across our state are struggling with rising costs. Multiple funding awards through the Long-Duration Energy Storage Demonstrations Program are also listed, including a $28 million award to Dairyland Power Cooperative, headquartered in La Crosse, to build out behind-the-meter energy storage systems to increase energy capacity and improve resilience in rural communities. Further, multiple Wisconsin entities were awarded funding from DOE to help increase domestic production of electric heat pumps through the Heat Pump Defense Production Act Program to drive energy innovation and security while creating new good-paying jobs nationwide. These funding awards are also included on the reported list for termination, creating significant uncertainty.

The University of Wisconsin-Madison is also among the recipients included in the proposed list of projects to be terminated. Our state university system has long been a hub for advanced energy research, and federal funds support cutting-edge work in fields like battery storage, carbon capture, grid modernization, and biofuels. These are areas that are critical for the future of U.S. energy independence, and losing this support will slow technological progress and hamper critical research into new and emerging technologies.

Finally, a roughly $1.5 million award to the Wisconsin Regional Training Partnership (WRTP) to support energy-related workforce training is included in the list for potential termination. Wisconsin is a national leader in apprenticeship and pre-apprenticeship programing, thanks to the work of state and local partners like WRTP. As new technologies develop and building code updates move forward in Wisconsin, a skilled energy workforce will become even more essential.

The projects and funding awards highlighted here are just a few of the many Wisconsin-connected awards and projects facing potential termination. Terminating these funding awards at a time of record-high energy demand and rising costs would be counterintuitive, reckless, and ill-advised. I urge you to reaffirm DOE’s commitment to honoring these funding awards and to continue supporting these investments that drive Wisconsin’s and the nation’s energy landscape forward.

Yours in service,

Tony Evers

Texas is a leader in the carbon economy today, and it should act now to ensure that it remains a leader in the new carbon economy of tomorrow.","The state’s existing workforce, infrastructure, and geological assets make it a natural fit to lead in the new carbon economy, and recently resolved federal policy makes the case even stronger.

Texas has long been a byword for energy leadership, whether that’s in its more-than-century-old oil industry or its position as the number one state in the nation for solar and wind capacity. Another accolade could soon be in reach for the Lone Star state: carbon management pioneer. By utilizing its world-class workforce, pipeline expertise, and unbeatable geological assets, Texas can be the global leader in the new multi-billion-dollar economy of storing and utilizing carbon — creating jobs, revenue, and cementing its status as a first-mover state.

Why now is different

The passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act was a significant moment for nearly every energy technology in the United States, but holds particular promise for carbon management — an emerging industry that creates value from the carbon dioxide produced from industrial activity, either by capturing and reusing it or by storing it. This can take the form of point-source carbon capture from industrial waste streams, direct air capture (DAC), pipelines to transport the carbon dioxide for various end uses, and using geological formations to store the carbon.

One of the critical policies for carbon management is the 45Q carbon oxide sequestration tax credit. Before July 2025, the tax credit was calculated based on the specific features of the project. Under that formulation of the credit, outlined in the Inflation Reduction Act, direct air capture projects qualified for more credit than point-source capture, and projects that stored the captured carbon in permanent storage qualified for more credit than those that sold or used the carbon for further industrial processes. However, the OBBBA modified the credit by raising the value of projects that utilize or sell carbon to equal that of projects that sequester carbon, for both point-source capture facilities and DAC facilities.

Exhibit 1

These changes will have a significant impact on the carbon management industry, closing the cost gap for more types of projects and presenting highly significant financial and job creation opportunities in states that pursue projects and infrastructure supportive of a carbon management economy.

Texas is poised to lead this growing industry

The increased value in 45Q presents a prime opportunity for Texas’s industrial clusters to source carbon at scale and unlock its considerable economic potential. Major industrial activities in Houston, San Antonio, Austin, Dallas-Fort Worth, Corpus Christi, and East Texas represent both sides of the supply and demand equation for carbon management processes, creating the potential for a homegrown industry.

Existing cement, refining, petrochemical, and plastic facilities offer both abundant carbon dioxide streams as well as strong demand for the captured carbon in order to produce urea, synthetic fuels, and other materials. The state offers a large carbon dioxide pool as industry produces over 367 million metric tons (Mt) of CO2 annually statewide, including power generation. Furthermore, the existing 2,325 miles of CO2 pipeline infrastructure, accounting for over 40% of the entire CO2 pipeline infrastructure in the US, can provide the needed infrastructure support to move the carbon where it is needed.

Beyond capturing and utilizing carbon, Texas’s subsurface geography provides unmatched long-term carbon storage capacity. The Department of Energy has estimated that Texas possesses over 1.6 billion Mt in potential storage capacity — equivalent to 4,000 years of today’s carbon output in the state. Texas offers an extensive carbon storage basin through depleted oil and gas reservoirs, and deep saline aquifer formations, which allow for proven containment with reduced costs and technical risks.

This storage capacity can be monetized. Companies that sequester the carbon dioxide underground are eligible to receive the federal 45Q tax credits, while an additional revenue stream can be created through the sale of carbon credits in voluntary carbon markets. Momentum is also building on the regulatory front: the EPA proposed approval of Texas’s Class VI underground injection well primacy application in June 2025. This represents one of the critical steps that will allow the state to streamline permitting for storage and accelerate carbon management.

Given this profile, over $10 billion in investments in carbon management are already flowing into Texas. Occidental Petroleum is investing $500 million to build the world’s largest DAC project in the Permian Basin, with the potential to capture 500,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. ExxonMobil’s acquisition of the 1,300-mile CO2 Denbury pipeline for $1.9 billion is also a critical infrastructure investment to facilitate carbon transportation in the Gulf. In Baytown, ExxonMobil is developing a $7 billion blue hydrogen facility (hydrogen produced via natural gas with carbon capture), the largest of its type in the world, to fuel its olefins plant and capture over 7 Mt of carbon annually. These projects demonstrate the scale and tangibility of Texas’s carbon management opportunity.

Exhibit 2

Exhibit 3

Texas stands to benefit immensely from the near-term opportunity to capture federal dollars from tax credits and generate economic growth. RMI analysis estimates that by 2050, Texas could see between $12 billion and $94 billion in investments in carbon management, and a cumulative economic benefit of $24 billion to $182 billion. (See Exhibit 4)

But carbon management’s benefits extend beyond the bottom line and reach into the wider Texas economy. Addressing carbon management proactively will retain Texas’s national and global status as an energy leader, with all the economic benefits that it brings. It also provides Texas with a low-risk, high-reward response to commercial opportunities from the global shift toward low-carbon energy.

The scaling of the carbon management industry can also support the creation of new jobs in engineering, construction of pipelines and carbon capture hubs, operations for hydrogen, carbon capture, and storage facilities, and advanced manufacturing for newer technologies like DAC and carbon utilization technologies. The world-class Texas oil and gas workforce is perfectly suited to transition into these new roles.

Depending on the uptake of carbon management in Texas, RMI analysis anticipates a cumulative creation of 21,000 to 211,000 new jobs through 2050 (See Exhibit 4).

Exhibit 4

Preparing for, rather than reacting to, the growing carbon management industry is the smartest way for Texas to seize this opportunity

The energy landscape is changing, new technology is emerging, and new policy frameworks are coming. Texas is a leader in the carbon economy today, and it should act now to ensure that it remains a leader in the new carbon economy of tomorrow.

The incentives through OBBBA will further help the economic case for projects that include carbon management technologies, and with its century of expertise in petroleum engineering and geology, and some of the highest-potential injection sites in the country, Texas has the foundation to define the future of carbon management in the United States. This opportunity is Texas’s to seize, and proactive policymakers and economic development organizations should start to get ready.",https://rmi.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/iStock-1780661745-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-15 14:02:21.033167

For the industry, smart grids are fast becoming a prerequisite. Global firms in electronics, automotive, and textiles now demand traceable low-carbon supply chains to meet tightening ESG standards. Countries that can guarantee reliable, renewable-powered electricity will have a competitive edge in attracting these investments. This translates into jobs not only in manufacturing, but also in the construction, installation, and long-term maintenance of the infrastructure that supports industrial growth.

In Senegal, a $10 million smart grid project created nearly 600 jobs, from engineers and construction workers to logistics providers and local service suppliers.

Scaling this to ASEAN’s estimated $4-10.7 billion investment need suggests up to 650,000 jobs could be created across the region. These roles would span design and engineering, digital meter installation, IT integration, and operations, while stimulating opportunities for local businesses that supply equipment, transport, and services.

The social dividends go beyond jobs. By reducing outages, smart grids cut reliance on diesel backup generators, which are widely used by households and businesses in countries like the Philippines and Myanmar. These generators are not only expensive to run but also a major source of urban air pollution.

Cleaner grids mean lower household energy costs, more reliable electricity for small enterprises, and measurable health benefits through reduced respiratory illness linked to pollution.

Smart grids can unlock the full potential of renewables, integrate distributed energy, and make systems more resilient, flexible, and investment-ready, serving as ASEAN’s bridge to a clean energy future and a competitive global edge.

Electric cars are getting better, cheaper, and have more options to choose from.
All of these early electric vehicles benefited from tax breaks approved by Democrats in Congress.
● Used electric cars are now selling faster than their gas counterparts, largely because they are cheaper.
Electric cars are not fizzling out and consumers want to drive them—and for some, doing so is the cheaper option.","If you were looking to buy an electric vehicle and take advantage of the federal tax break that offered car owners between $4,000 and $7,000 in savings, you are SOL.

As of October 1, the break offered through Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act has gone the way of the dodo.

Its demise won’t surprise anyone who’s been following the Trump administration’s systematic dismantling of clean energy programs and incentives. President Donald Trump’s first-day executive order, “Unleashing American Energy,” called for the “elimination of unfair subsidies” and froze a $5 billion program to establish charging stations in rural areas and disadvantaged communities. A federal court this summer ordered the funds to be restored after 14 states sued.

But the end of the EV rebate has highlighted an encouraging reality: It turns out that electric vehicles are more popular than Republicans have been giving them credit for.

In the final days of the rebate, purchases soared. Sales of EVs between July, August and September shot up 21% compared to last year, according to forecasts from tech company Cox Automotive, a 30% increase just from this spring.

Even without the tax breaks, data shows that EVs are here to stay. And the market is proving it.

Elaine Buckberg, a former General Motors economist now at Harvard University’s Salata Institute for Climate and Sustainability, told Bloomberg that she estimates 37% of new cars bought in 2030 will be electric. The reason? Electric cars are getting better, cheaper, and have more options to choose from.

“In the most likely scenario, you end up about two years behind on adoption,” Buckberg said of the impact of the rebate elimination. ”I think [EVs] will be more resilient than people are thinking.”

By all indications, electric vehicles have become commercial enough, economical enough, and—may I suggest—desirable enough that the future of ownership actually feels bright.

Everyone has a different cultural reference when they think back to the early days of clean energy cars. I have memories of stinky, vegetable-oil-guzzling hippie vans I saw traversing my hometown of Santa Barbara, California, and later the OG Prius hybrid hatchbacks my friend’s parents picked us up in after days spent at the beach. In short: They were not cool.

It was in college at George Washington University in 2011 that I got to drive the prototype of the Nissan Leaf, the first mass-market, all-electric vehicle offered in the United States. (I’ll never forget the shame I felt after I took the car out of the parking lot and promptly clipped a curb. All in the name of science, right?)

Later, Teslas helped change the image of electric vehicles from the car for the environmentalist to cars for anyone—well, those who could afford to shell out at least $98,000.

All of these early electric vehicles benefited from tax breaks approved by Democrats in Congress. Back in 2009, Congress passed a bill that offered $2,500 to $7,500 in tax rebates for the purchase of a new, qualified, plug-in EV. Originally, the program limited the credits to the first 200,000 qualifying plug-in EVs sold by each automaker; Tesla and GM were the first to hit the limit by 2019.

Republicans for years threatened to repeal the credits, but Biden actually helped expand the rebate through his 2022 Inflation Reduction Act and lifted the cap.

It would have kept the program going until 2032.

Despite the end to the rebate, there are many promising signs that EVs aren’t going anywhere.

● For one, charging stations expanded 19% just in the first nine months of this year—including a record number of new fast chargers—a growth attributed to companies working to meet the public’s increased demand.

● Brands like Waffle House, Cracker Barrel, and Target are boosting the technology by expanding fast-charging options in their parking lots, including in the deep south.

● Used electric cars are now selling faster than their gas counterparts, largely because they are cheaper. And it’s leading unlikely consumers to consider buying EVs for the first time.

●Internationally, countries are also doubling down on electric-vehicle investment. Last week, Germany’s chancellor agreed to offer €3 billion (nearly $3.5 billion) in EV purchase incentives. Italy’s incentives program starts this month. Other countries that offer big price cuts include Poland and Greece.

●At home, 17 states offer state tax incentives for EV purchases. Colorado recently upped its incentive, now offering car owners up to $9,000 to swap their gas vehicles for an EV lease or sale. The city of Burlington, Vermont, in September announced plans to double its EV rebate to $5,000.

Of course, it’s not all rosey. Some predict the EV market will take a big dip after the tax breaks end. A study in November 2024 from professors at the University of California, Berkeley and Duke University estimated that EV registrations could fall 27% without the tax credit.

Still, history offers an important precedent. The Obama administration was the first to make a big bet on electric cars with limited tax breaks, which were only meant to jump-start the tech before consumers took the lead. And it’s looking like that bet paid off. Electric cars are not fizzling out and consumers want to drive them—and for some, doing so is the cheaper option. We are living in an era where EVs are now interwoven in our collective futures and the technology will continue unabated, even without the White House’s help.",https://atmos.earth/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/EV-tax-breaks-hor-1280x720.jpg,N,,2025-10-15 14:02:46.574493

The Allam-Fetvedt Cycle requires high-purity oxygen separated from air, which is mostly nitrogen and trace amounts of other gases.
If that rises to 30%, the problems associated with fluctuations in wind and solar energy production will be exacerbated, making energy storage critical for overall grid reliability,” Moore said.
“Currently, there’s no large-scale energy storage system on the grid, though research is underway.
“Air separation and liquid oxygen generation have been around for decades.","SAN ANTONIO — October 15, 2025 — Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) and 8 Rivers have patented a system that leverages fluctuations in energy demand by using liquid oxygen storage (LOX) to make power plants more cost-effective and efficient. To accomplish this, the Institute modified a recently developed power cycle, the Allam-Fetvedt Cycle, which combusts fuel, like natural gas, using an oxygen and carbon dioxide mixture to allow complete carbon capture, producing minimal greenhouse gas emissions.

The Allam-Fetvedt Cycle requires high-purity oxygen separated from air, which is mostly nitrogen and trace amounts of other gases. This separation process is energy-intense and consumes 10% of a power plant’s output.

“Our idea is to generate oxygen during off-peak hours, when electricity is less expensive because demand is lower,” said SwRI Institute Engineer Dr. Jeffrey Moore, one of the new system’s inventors. “The oxygen can then be stored in liquid form and then converted back into gas for use in the plant later. This boosts plant output while lowering operating costs.”

To ensure that a power plant utilizing this technology would be profitable, SwRI conducted a techno-economic analysis, modeling both plant performance and hour-by-hour costs over a full year. Studies by Princeton University and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory showed that current price volatility for electricity will continue to increase as more forms of renewable energy come online, indicating that the economic benefits of the application will persist or grow in the future.

“The data show that in some regions prices may stay low for weeks, then spike for long periods, depending on renewable penetration. Right now, the grid is about 10–15% renewables. If that rises to 30%, the problems associated with fluctuations in wind and solar energy production will be exacerbated, making energy storage critical for overall grid reliability,” Moore said. “Currently, there’s no large-scale energy storage system on the grid, though research is underway. This oxygen storage system is one way to effectively store energy, by generating liquid oxygen when power is cheap and using it later when prices are higher.”

The researchers are also considering incorporating it into the Supercritical Transformational Electric Power (STEP) Demo pilot plant at SwRI’s San Antonio headquarters. It’s one of the largest demonstration facilities in the world for supercritical carbon dioxide power generation. Adding LOX and the Allam-Fetvedt cycle to STEP would make it even more fuel-efficient.

“The components of this system are very mature,” Moore said. “Air separation and liquid oxygen generation have been around for decades. That’s what got us to the moon. We’re putting these tested individual pieces together at larger scales, to reach greater heights in clean energy production and improving net present value of the plant.”

Due to the tariff, AEP was able to remove ""the most speculative or uncertain data center projects,"" said a spokesperson.
While demand fell abruptly in Ohio, demand across other states is expected to remain very high.
Meanwhile, Oregon’s data center power demand is expected to exceed 4GW by the end of 2025, up from 3.5GW last year.","According to a forecast from 451 Research, part of S&P Global, utility power provided to hyperscale, leased, and crypto-mining data centers will rise by roughly 11.3GW in 2025 to 61.8GW.

In 2026, US data center demand is projected to rise to 75.8GW for IT equipment, cooling, lighting, and other uses, and expand to 108GW in 2028, and 134.4GW in 2030. The outlook does not include enterprise-owned data centers outside of hyperscale tech giants such as Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and Apple.

Despite forecasting significant demand increases, the forecast notes that some utilities are reporting declining data center interconnection requests. S&P highlights the recent announcement by American Electric Power Ohio (AEP) that it had cut its data center pipeline in half, with demand falling from more than 30GW to 13GW.

The reduction, according to AEP Ohio, was the result of a new data center tariff, approved by the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO) in July, that required data centers to pay for a portion of their energy requests, even if the electricity is not ultimately needed. Due to the tariff, AEP was able to remove ""the most speculative or uncertain data center projects,"" said a spokesperson.

While demand fell abruptly in Ohio, demand across other states is expected to remain very high.

As noted by forecasts from 451 Research, data center electricity demand in Virginia is projected to reach approximately 12.1GW in 2025, up from 9.3GW in 2024.

In Texas, power consumption from data centers is expected to climb to around 9.7GW this year, up from just under 8GW in the previous year, fueled largely by crypto-mining operations and leasing activity.

Meanwhile, Oregon’s data center power demand is expected to exceed 4GW by the end of 2025, up from 3.5GW last year. Other states - including Arizona, Georgia, Ohio, California, Illinois, and Iowa - are projected to record statewide data center demand ranging from 2.3GW to 3.2GW, according to the same analysis.

Reflecting on the report, Stefanie Williams, a senior analyst at 451 Research, said: ""Ample land, reasonable power costs, dense fiber, and demand from hyperscalers continue to drive growth in the state.

""Additionally, we see significant growth in Ohio, particularly around Columbus, where data center operators have clustered for years.""

The report also notes that demand is increasing in several smaller markets, namely, Idaho, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and smaller cities in West Texas. Unlike in more established markets, due to grid limitations, onsite power options have grown in popularity, often centered on areas with ample natural gas supply, such as the Permian Basin in Texas.

""This is largely driven by the search for stranded power and alternative energy generation opportunities,"" Williams said.",https://media.datacenterdynamics.com/media/images/GettyImages-950365224_BAgITcr.2e16d0ba.fill-1200x630.jpg,N,,2025-10-15 14:04:58.672510

But for the portion that was covered by the clean energy tax credits, these federal tax credits, they are hoping to replace with either local sources of funding or state sources of funding.

The Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act allocated money for clean energy vehicles, including electric school buses. It was supposed to last through the end of 2032, but the One Big Beautiful Bill Act ended them at the end of September.

According to the Electric School Bus Initiative, Arizona districts had nearly 230 electric school buses committed, but only 49 that either have been delivered or are operating.

With the tax credit ending, those numbers — both in Arizona and around the country — may not see much increase.

Julia Gentin has covered climate education at The Hechinger Report. She joined The Show to discuss the status of states, districts and schools that were banking on being able to change out some of their bus fleets to electric?

Full conversation

JULIA GENTIN: Well, basically under the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act, schools were going to be able to have this tax credit for electric vehicles for the next seven years. So, it was set to expire in 2032. But now, under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, or H.R. 1, any electric vehicle that is acquired after September 30 of this year, 2025, will not be eligible for tax credits.

MARK BRODIE: So does that mean that there are likely going to be fewer electric school buses on the roads around the country than districts maybe had thought?

GENTIN: Yeah, for schools that have already purchased their buses but not yet received them, they are going to be OK and they can still continue to receive that tax credit because they've entered into this contract and purchased the buses. But for schools that have had considered for more long term, you know, adding the electric school buses, they will not be able to receive the tax credit if they haven't been purchased by Sept. 30.

BRODIE: Do you have a sense of how many buses or what percentage of electric school buses this might entail, in terms of districts that had been hoping to have them that will not be able to get them because they don't have the tax incentive anymore?

GENTIN: I would say I don't have a number on that, but the amount that it could affect per vehicle from the loss of these tax credits would be about $40,000. So for districts that were considering, or who had these in more of a long-term net zero energy-type resolution, they would not be able to count on federal funding anymore in that form.

BRODIE: What did some of the districts with whom you spoke for your reporting tell you that they planned to do?

GENTIN: Well, I talked to the Los Angeles Unified School District. So this is outside of Arizona, but they were at first really worried because the wording in H.R. 1 had initially been interpreted as ""buses placed into service"" and they weren't supposed to receive buses. They just got a notification that it was going to be before the first quarter of 2026, but they didn't know when they were coming.

So, they were really worried because they had already purchased these buses and were hoping to get the 30% of those costs covered by the Inflation Reduction Act-era tax credits. But then they thought that they couldn't anymore. The good thing is, on Aug. 15, there was sort of a rewording of that because I think the government realized there were a lot of districts in that same situation — where they had ordered the buses, but they hadn't come yet.

And that's something that Sue Gander at the World Resource Institute Electric School Bus Initiative was telling me — that there were a lot of school districts in that same situation that were stressed about when they would, they didn't know when they would get the buses. But luckily, the new Treasury Department guidance said, ""OK, for schools in that situation, as long as you purchase the bus, you'll be OK.""

For Tucson, though, in their school district, they had already gotten — I think — a 10-bus fleet. That was in Nov. 2024. So, that was through funding from the federal government, but a slightly different bucket of funding. It was the Environmental Protection Agency's Clean School Bus Program. But that, for most districts, only covered about two-thirds of the funding, and the remaining one-third was to be covered by this federal tax credit.

BRODIE: What are folks in the advocacy world supporting the adoption of more electric school buses saying about what kind of impact the loss of this tax credit might have?

GENTIN: Well, I think I said before this, but the loss of that tax credit could impact around $40,000 per vehicle. So, that means across the country there are more than half a million buses transporting 21 million kids to school. And there are all sorts of environmental impacts that come with these diesel- or fossil-fueled buses.

So, the hope was that the transition could continue, but now it's more of like, telling districts, ""you have to get these buses as soon as possible; otherwise, you won't be able to receive tax credits for them and you won't be able to electrify your fleet."" So, I think it will delay a lot of the electrification processes and the majority — this 90% of fossil fuel diesel school buses — will continue operating.

BRODIE: Does it seem as though advocates think this really is just a delay and not sort of the ending of this effort to electrify fleets?

GENTIN: It seems like districts still have hope and advocates still have hope that there could be some other funding sources that they look to to fill that gap. However, the Environmental Protection Agency's Clean School Bus Program, I believe, is expiring in two years. So that's, that's another setback. But for the portion that was covered by the clean energy tax credits, these federal tax credits, they are hoping to replace with either local sources of funding or state sources of funding.

But some states are more fortunate than others. For example, California has a lot of resources to fund electric school buses and electric vehicles, but some other states just don't have those resources.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/596f246/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5150x2704+0+1243/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fd7%2F56%2Fd190939e4f8fb5bf7fdad76d2634%2Fjulia-gentin-20251014.jpeg,N,,2025-10-15 13:09:06.946350

Enrollees can claim this refundable credit in full even if they have little to no tax liability.

The PTC is also advanceable (referred to as the Advance Premium Tax Credit, or APTC) to reduce up-front premium costs, as consumers can choose to have the APTC automatically applied to monthly health insurance premiums.i When taken as an APTC, the credit is paid directly to the insurer.

Figure 1: How Do PTCs and Enhanced PTCs Work?

Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, Congress passed the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (ARPA), which temporarily expanded the populations eligible for these tax credits and the amount of financial assistance provided for two years. Under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA), Congress extended these so-called enhanced PTCs (also known as enhanced Advance Premium Tax Credits, or eAPTCs) through December 31, 2025.

Congress now faces a set of difficult choices with significant implications for the federal deficit, the number of insured Americans, and the financial burden insurance imposes on consumers.

With expiration approaching, Congress could:

permanently extend enhanced PTCs at current levels;

allow the enhanced PTCs to expire (and revert to standard PTC levels);

temporarily extend the enhanced PTCs for a limited duration; or

modify eligibility criteria or the size of the enhanced PTCs.ii

Any policy action—or inaction—is likely to impact both the federal deficit and marketplace rates for 2026. Insurers’ proposed rate filings indicate that individual market premiums will increase approximately 18% in 2026, up from the 7% increase proposed last year, although the actual increase that will take effect January 1, 2026, will likely differ.iii[1]

This issue brief addresses: (1) PTCs and subsequent changes, (2) populations that would be significantly affected if the enhanced PTCs expire, (3) the various options to reform the enhanced PTCs, and (4) recent policy proposals, including available cost and coverage impacts.

Premium Tax Credits and Subsequent Changes

Premium Tax Credits include several features that were temporarily enhanced under ARPA and extended under the IRA through the end of 2025.ivv The enhanced PTCs temporarily expanded eligibility for premium subsidies to individuals with incomes above 400% of the federal poverty line (FPL) and increased the available subsidies.vi See Figure 2.

Figure 2: Key Features of PTCs and Enhanced PTCs

Features PTC

(Permanent Law) Enhanced PTC

(Temporary Changes from PTC) Eligibility

Eligibility for premium assistance is limited to households with incomes between 100% and 400% of FPL (or up to $62,600 for a single adult and $128,600 for a household of four in 2025), among other requirements.

The eligibility cutoff at 400% of FPL is often referred to as the “subsidy cliff.”

The previous eligibility limit of up to 400% of FPL is temporarily eliminated, allowing households with incomes above 400% of FPL to qualify for the subsidies.

This temporarily eliminates the “subsidy cliff.”

Income-based, Sliding Scale Subsidies

Enrollees pay a sliding-scale share of their income toward a benchmark “silver” plan premium.

No change.

Maximum Share of Income that Individuals Are Required to Contribute

The sliding-scale share rises with income, from about 2% of income (for households up to 133% of FPL) up to 9.5% of income (for households at 400% of FPL).

People with incomes under 150% of FPL have zero or near-zero premiums.

Households do not pay more than 8.5% of income for the benchmark silver plan premium.

Absent congressional action, the enhanced PTCs will sunset in December 2025, with coverage reverting to the less generous pre‑ARPA PTC schedule. See Figure 4.

Most recently, in July 2025, Congress passed reconciliation legislation (H.R. 1) that contained several enhanced PTC-related changes (but with no change to enhanced PTCs’ expiration date). These legislated changes followed related regulatory changes in the June 2025 Marketplace Integrity and Affordability Final Rule issued by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). Taken together, H.R. 1 and the Marketplace Integrity Rule tighten enrollment and administrative requirements, limiting access to enhanced PTCs and reducing the number of consumers who can claim the credits.vii Relevant provisions in H.R. 1 and CMS’s recent regulation are outlined in Figure 3.

Figure 3: Key Changes to Premium Subsidies under H.R. 1 and the 2025 Marketplace Integrity Rule

Rescinds Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients’ eligibility for PTCs.

Ends 60-day auto-extension for resolving data matching issues.

Adjusts actuarial value rules and de minimis thresholds.

Establishes more rigorous income verification (2026).

Requires pre-enrollment verification for SEP eligibility (2026).

Pauses year-round SEP for persons with incomes ≤150% of FPL (2026).

Ends automatic reenrollment in $0 premium plans (2026).

Eliminates fixed-dollar and gross percentage-based premium payment thresholds (2026).

Ends APTC for failure to file and reconcile (also codified in H.R. 1).

Many of these changes respond to concerns related to potential improper payment of premium tax credits.

By design, advance payment of the tax credit requires enrollees to make a good-faith effort to project how much money they will make in the year to come, as this estimate determines the size of the tax credit. As discussed in the Bipartisan Policy Center’s 2024 article, “Paying the 2025 Tax Bill: Health Care Improper Payments,” projecting income is particularly difficult for people with fluctuating incomes due to tenuous attachments to the workforce, the vagaries of hourly and/or seasonal jobs, or working in the gig economy.x

The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that 1.3 million marketplace enrollees improperly claimed the tax credit for 2023 and an estimated 2.3 million enrollees did so for 2025, based on enrollment data demonstrating an unusual concentration of enrollees reporting income just above the FPL.xi

CMS’s recent regulatory changes have drawn several ongoing court challenges, reflecting disagreement over the agency’s authority to regulate ACA marketplaces. In August 2025, a federal judge paused implementation of parts of the Marketplace Rule, following a challenge brought by the cities of Chicago and Baltimore. The cities argued that the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) violated the Administrative Procedure Act and that parts of the Marketplace Rule violate the ACA.xii

Estimated Impact of Enhanced PTCs’ Expiration

Health insurance enrollment through ACA marketplaces reached 24.3 million in 2025, more than double the 11.4 million who were enrolled in 2020.xiii About 22.4 million enrollees (92%) received advance payments of the enhanced premium tax credit in 2025.xiv

Expiration of the enhanced PTCs will increase premiums for these individuals and their families, with the size of the increase varying based on income, household size, and location. Higher premiums will especially affect several key populations, including individuals under age 55; older adults with incomes above 400% of FPL; individuals and families with low (up to 150% of FPL) and middle incomes (400%-500% of FPL); populations with higher uninsurance risk; and individuals and families in rural areas.xvxvi

Younger, Healthier Individuals Could Exit the Marketplace. Since Congress established the enhanced PTCs, individuals under age 55 have accounted for an increasing portion of open enrollment period plan selections through the marketplace.xviii At the same time, the portion of older adults ages 55+ has decreased from 30% of marketplace participants in 2020 to 24% in 2025.xix See Figure 6.

Accordingly, enhanced PTCs have been credited with making ACA coverage more affordable and bringing more people, including healthier or lower-cost enrollees, into the marketplace.xxxxi These trends also align with CBO’s estimate that permanent extension of the enhanced PTCs would lower gross premiums for benchmark plans by 7.6% on average in each year from 2026-2035 due to an expected healthier risk pool.xxii

Given the surge in marketplace enrollment following enhanced PTC implementation, it is reasonable to assume that enhanced PTCs have enabled more people to get health care.xxiiixxiv Studies have documented these ACA-related increases, particularly in primary and preventive care visits, while early ARPA-period surveys have demonstrated improved access to and uptake of routine services.xxvxxvi This uptake then, in turn, can both help prevent and manage costly chronic diseases.xxviixxviii

Older adults (ages 50-64) with incomes above 400% of FPL. Marketplace plan premiums increase significantly with age, as a 64-year-old pays three times more for coverage than younger adults ages 21-24 in most states.xxix This means that expiration of the enhanced PTCs will disproportionately affect older adults who earn just above the pre-ARPA PTC income eligibility limit of 400% of FPL. For example, a 60-year-old couple with an annual income at 402% of FPL (about $85,000) could pay a yearly premium of $22,600 in 2026, or about a quarter of their annual income, instead of 8.5% of their income (as established under enhanced PTCs).xxx

Individuals and families with low and middle incomes. As 45% of all enrollees (or 10.9 million people) with OEP plan selections had incomes between 100% and 150% of FPL in 2025, many of these individuals could see their premiums increase from $0 in 2025 up to 4% of income (for those at the top of the income range) in 2026 upon expiration of the enhanced PTCs. For example, a family of four with a household income of $45,000 (140% of FPL) with a $0 premium in 2025 will see their premiums increase to $1,607 a year. See Figure 7.

Similarly, an analysis by the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) in coordination with CBO showed that extension of the enhanced PTCs would disproportionately benefit individuals and families with incomes between $100,000 and $150,000.xxxi For example, a family of four with a household income of $110,000 could see an increase of $3,201 in their annual premium payment in 2026, with the premium reaching 10% of the family’s income ($10,956) instead of 7.1% ($7,755).xxxii See Figure 7.

Individuals and families with incomes above 400% of FPL will also see significant premium increases absent the enhanced PTCs. Moreover, almost 725,000 individuals and families with incomes between 400% and 500% of FPL (or 4% of marketplace enrollees) will no longer be eligible to receive the PTC following the expiration of the enhanced PTCs.xxxiii One estimate finds that average premiums for this population with a household income over 400% of FPL (or over $62,600 for an individual and $128,600 for a family of four in 2025) will increase by more than $2,900 per year if the enhanced PTCs expire.xxxiv

FPL stands for Federal Poverty Level. Required contribution percentages refer to the maximum share of income ACA Marketplace enrollees are required to pay for a benchmark plan. The “2026 Tax Credits” scenario represents the required contribution percentages that will be in place for 2026 if enhanced tax credits are not renewed. Premium increases will vary for enrollees with incomes over 400% of poverty based on family size, age, and location.

Small businesses and gig workers. The Department of the Treasury’s Office of Tax Analysis estimated that, in 2022, over 2.7 million (or 82%) of self-employed workers and small-business owners claimed the PTC, including about 285,000 taxpayers with incomes over 400% of FPL.xxxvi

Similarly, an analysis from KFF estimates that almost half of adult enrollees in the individual health insurance market (the majority of which is purchased through marketplaces) are small-business owners, employees, or self-employed workers, and certain occupations are particularly reliant on individual market coverage.xxxvii

These occupations in which at least a quarter of adult workers relied on individual market coverage in 2023 included chiropractors (34%) and dentists (26%); real estate brokers and sales agents (28%); and farmers, ranchers, and agricultural managers (27%).xxxviii

Populations with high uninsurance risk. Certain populations with a higher uninsurance risk, including Black and Latino consumers, will be disproportionately impacted by the expiration of the enhanced PTCs.xxxixxlAlthough these populations are still substantially more likely to be uninsured compared with other populations, they have seen significant gains in recent years that have helped to reduce coverage disparities.

Between 2020 and 2024, HealthCare.gov plan selections increased by over 200% among Black consumers and by 185% among Latinos, according to HHS’s assistant secretary for planning and evaluation (ASPE).xli CMS data similarly shows that the percentage of total consumers with OEP plan selections increased among Hispanics/Latinos from 18% in 2020 to 22% in 2025 and Blacks from 8% in 2020 to 10% in 2025.xlii

Although these populations still account for a smaller portion of marketplace consumers compared with white consumers (52% in 2025), recent coverage gains could be lost if the enhanced PTCs expire.xliii

Individuals and families in rural areas. Among the 17.1 million consumers who enrolled through HealthCare.gov in 2025, 3.1 million (or 18.1%) were in rural areas.xlivxlv These individuals disproportionately benefit from the enhanced PTCs compared with their urban counterparts. An HHS study found that the enhanced PTCs saved enrollees in rural areas an average of $890 per year in 2024, about 28% more than their urban counterparts.xlvi

Some estimates project that most rural states will experience, on average, a 30% decrease in marketplace coverage and a 37% increase in uninsured populations if the enhanced PTCs expire, as premiums could increase from $760 up to $3,000 or more in rural areas.xlviixlviii

Key Policy Levers for Adjusting Enhanced PTCs

When assessing reform options, Congress can consider adjusting the enhanced PTCs’ sunset date, changing the income eligibility limit, adjusting the maximum share of income that individuals are required to contribute toward the premium, and enacting paused provisions of the 2025 Marketplace Integrity Rule.xlixlPolicymakers can also consider a combination of these policy levers.

Adjust the sunset date: Extend the enhanced PTCs (e.g., permanently or for 1, 2, 3, 5, or 10 years), either with no change to eligibility or premium contribution levels or with some modifications. See Figure 8 for available data on the cost of various extension options and the coverage effects. An extension could include grandfathering existing enhanced PTC recipients but eliminating or restricting eligibility for enhanced PTCs in future years.

Adjust income eligibility: If extending the enhanced PTC, Congress can consider restoring the PTC income eligibility limit of 400% of FPL or establishing an income limit at some percentage above 400% of FPL. This option could include establishing and gradually phasing down an income eligibility limit for enhanced PTCs to prior PTC levels.

Adjust the maximum share of income that individuals are required to contribute toward the premium: If extending the enhanced PTC, Congress could gradually ratchet up the cap on the maximum percentage of household income that individuals are required to contribute toward the premium.

Target individuals with incomes at 400%+ of FPL: For example, extending two years, in 2027, increase the cap from 8.5% to 9% of income for an individual with an income at 400%+ of FPL.

Target restriction or elimination of $0 premiums for individuals with low incomes: Some policymakers have recently suggested ensuring that individuals have “skin in the game” by eliminating $0 premiums to address program integrity concerns that some enrollees may have been automatically enrolled and are unaware that they have coverage.li For example, Congress could increase the cap from 0% to 1% for some portion of individuals with incomes up to 150% of FPL.

Enact paused provisions of the 2025 Marketplace Integrity Rule through legislation: As discussed above, legal challenges have paused implementation of certain provisions of the 2025 Marketplace Integrity Rule, including shortened annual enrollment; rescinding of eligibility for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients; SEP eligibility verification and ending enrollment in $0 premium plans. Policymakers desiring implementation of certain provisions impacting enhanced PTCs could overcome these legal challenges by enacting the provisions into law.

The CBO baseline assumes the expiration of the enhanced PTC as provided for in current law. Permanently extending the enhanced PTCs would increase the federal deficit by $350 billion from 2026-2035 and the number of people with health insurance by 3.8 million in 2035, according to CBO.lii See Figure 8.

In recent months, some members of Congress have introduced legislation, including bipartisan legislation, to extend the enhanced PTCs for one to two years. These bills include the following:

R. 5145, the Bipartisan Premium Tax Credit Extension Act. Introduced by Rep. Jennifer Kiggans (R-VA), with 13 Republican and 10 Democratic cosponsors, this bill would extend enhanced PTCs for one year through December 31, 2026.

2824, a bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to extend the temporary enhanced premium credits.

Figure 8: Policy Options for Extension of Enhanced PTCs and Available Cost and Coverage Impacts (CBO and JCT Estimates)

Policy Options Policy Details Federal Deficit Impact Coverage Impact Permanent extension Congress makes enhanced PTCs permanent (as established under ARPA and extended under IRA). Increases the federal deficit by $349.8 billion from 2026–2035, with the financial benefits primarily reaching individuals with incomes from $15K–$30K and $100K–$150K.liii

Similarly, an earlier CBO and JCT estimate (2024) found that about half of the increase in enrollment and 69% of the total cost of the premium tax credit for people who enrolled because of a permanent extension would be for people with income below 400% of FPL, and 31% ($113 billion) would be for those with incomes at or above 400% of FPL.liv

Increases the number of insured by 3.8 million in 2035.lv One-year extension (2026) Congress extends current enhanced PTCs to December 31, 2026.

Proposed legislation: H.R. 5145, Bipartisan Premium Tax Credit Extension Act.

Increases the federal deficit by $23.4 billion in 2026, with the financial benefits primarily reaching individuals with incomes under $200K.lvi Increases the number of insured by 2 million by 2026.lvii Two-year extension (2026–2027) Congress extends enhanced PTCs to December 31, 2027.

Proposed legislation: S. 2824, a bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to extend the temporary enhanced premium credits.

Increases the federal deficit by $55.3 billion from 2026–2027.lviii Increases the number of insured by 3.5 million by 2027.lix Three-year extension (2026–2028) Congress extends enhanced PTCs to December 31, 2028. Increases the federal deficit by $85.7 billion.lx Increases the number of insured by 3.7 million by 2028.lxi

Conclusion

Congress faces challenging decisions that will have major implications for both the private insurance market and federal deficits. As Congress considers a path forward on the expiring enhanced PTCs, any bipartisan agreement should balance stabilizing coverage and maintaining fiscal sustainability by offsetting costs associated with any potential extension of the enhanced PTCs.lxii

[lxxxviii] In a Health Affairs Forefront article (May 2025) with scholars from the American Enterprise Institute (AEI) and the Brookings Institution, BPC recommended four reforms to rein in health care costs and ensure that health care dollars are spent more effectively while still ensuring that people have access to needed care. Notably, among these, implementing site neutral payments in Medicare could reduce federal deficits by $157 billion between 2026 and 2034, according to CBO.

India’s state-owned refiners reduced purchases of Russian oil by more than 45% between June and September this year, according to data from Kpler.","New Delhi: India would be willing to step up its purchases of American oil and gas if prices are competitive, a senior government official said, at a time when New Delhi has come under intense US pressure for buying discounted Russian crude.

Union commerce secretary Rajesh Agarwal, who left for Washington on Wednesday to join the negotiations for the bilateral trade agreement (BTA) with the US, said that India is open to increasing its crude and gas imports from the US if prices remain viable for domestic refiners.

India, on average, imports $12–13 billion worth of crude oil and gas from the US every year. There is headroom for an additional $12–13 billion in purchases without requiring any changes to refinery configurations, he said, adding that India will consider buying more energy products, keeping in view the cost dynamics.

“Our team is currently in the US, holding discussions with American counterparts on energy trade and related cooperation,” Agarwal said on the sidelines of a press conference held to announce the monthly trade data.

The Indian team will hold trade pact discussions with their counterparts till 17 October.

His comments come against the backdrop of the US decision to impose an additional 25% tariff on India’s exports for buying Russian oil, a measure that is expected to sharply raise costs for Indian refiners and complicate New Delhi’s energy diversification strategy. Indian exports to the US now face 50% tariffs.

“To secure a deal, India may eventually have to halt its imports of Russian oil unless the US court strikes down the current levy. The earlier price discounts on Russian crude are no longer available, and with the narrowing price gap, India’s purchases of Russian oil are likely to taper off in the coming months,” said Ajay Srivastava, co-founder, Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI), a think-tank.

The US has said that India's purchases of Russian oil fuel Moscow's war against Ukraine.

Earlier, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on 10 October that India is expected to begin shifting its energy imports, reducing purchases of Russian oil.

Bessent had said, “Do you think, in your estimation, you've run all the numbers, would this war be possible now, were it not for China and India's involvement in those purchases? Absolutely not. So they're keeping the war going.”

Mint reported on 25 September that the US has asked India to give an assurance, possibly in writing, that it will taper its purchases of Russian oil and boost imports of American crude before a trade deal between the two nations can be finalised.

Energy imports have become the main sticking point in the ongoing talks, which are being steered by US trade representative (USTR) Jamieson Greer, and not by commerce secretary Howard Lutnick.

The Indian negotiating team is also expected to discuss other contentious issues such as agriculture, dairy, genetically modified (GM) crops, and non-tariff barriers during the talks. The US has been insisting on deeper market access for its agricultural and dairy exports, areas that remain a red line for India.

India’s state-owned refiners reduced purchases of Russian oil by more than 45% between June and September this year, according to data from Kpler. The data show that refiners imported around 600,000 barrels per day (bpd) of oil from Russia in September, a significant decline from about 1.1 million bpd in June.

Historically, Russia wasn't India's primary source of crude oil. After Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, India ramped up its oil imports from a negligible 0.2% of total imports to 35–40%, saving an estimated $17 billion through discounted purchases.

India has also signaled its willingness to make concessions amid the ongoing trade tensions by waiving the 11% duty on cotton imports until the end of the year, in what is seen as a gesture towards the United States.

As per the commerce ministry data, bilateral trade between India and the US stood at $71.41 billion in H1 FY26, up by 11.8% from $63.89 billion in H1 FY25. Exports to the US grew by 13.4%, rising from $40.42 billion in H1 FY25 to $45.82 billion, while imports increased by 9% from $23.47 billion to $25.59 billion.

100% Did You Cash In On the EV Tax Credit?","It’s now a post-electric-forward world here in the United States, and that means that a lot of programs and tax incentives for EVs have been straight-up cancelled. That meant a surge of electric buyers while those offers lasted, but unsurprisingly, some brands did much better than others.

Welcome back to Critical Materials, your morning roundup of industry and technology news. Today, we’re talking about some big EV projects slated for loss of funding from the U.S. Department of Energy, but also the winners and losers in terms of EV sales before tax credits officially collapsed. Meanwhile, in China, Polestar has officially closed its last store—what's next for the brand there?

30% EV Registrations Surge Before IRA Ends

Photo by: InsideEVs

It’s officially over, folks. The IRA tax credit is done and gone for, but before it ended, lots of EV buyers rushed to cash in before the tax credit evaporated entirely.

The tax credits ended in September, but it always takes a few weeks for new car registration data to trickle in. Now, we have a sense of the winners and losers in August. EV registrations were up a whopping 24% that month, but not all models were equally loved, according to reporting from Automotive News.

Mainstream brands won big, while luxury brands were fairly ignored. The Honda Prologue was one of the biggest winners, but on the backs of heavy incentives. Emphasis mine below:

The Honda Prologue was among August’s biggest winners as registrations jumped 81 percent to 9,005 vehicles. The Prologue was the No. 3 most-popular EV for the month after the Tesla Model Y crossover and Model 3 sedan, S&P Global Mobility said.

Registration data serve as a proxy for sales because some EV makers don’t separate U.S. results or report sales by model. Many automakers also don’t report sales monthly.

The Prologue came with incentives of $12,704 per vehicle in August, compared with $5,813 a year earlier, Motor Intelligence said. In contrast, Honda’s gasoline-powered CR-V crossover had $2,016 in August incentives, the data provider said.

The real information here is that buyers are clearly shopping on price. Buyers want a cheap car, and the Prologue has some of the best incentives and deals to get drivers behind the wheel. Likewise, cars like the Hyundai Ioniq 5 also have strong pricing incentives to get buyers in the door. But that's a lot of cash on the hood to get people to buy a Honda EV, for example.

Also up: the Tesla Model Y, Chevrolet's EVs and the Ioniq 5. Down: Cadillac Lyriq didn’t see all that much growth, partially because of the brand’s incentive cut for that model, the Tesla Model 3 (people may just be buying the SUV instead) and the Cybertruck.

I think going forward, the U.S. EV market will likely continue to fall along lines of price. So, cars like the new Chevrolet Bolt, Nissan Leaf or updated Hyundai Ioniq 5 will likely continue to be winners for most consumers—and hopefully more cheap options are on their way.

60% The Department of Energy Pulls the Plug on Some EV Projects

It’s not been an easy time for any EV manufacturer in the United States.

Since President Trump has taken office, EVs and clean energy have become incredibly politicized. Of course, the Inflation Reduction Act’s promises, including the EV tax credit, may have been the most visible on the chopping block, but there are other changes, too. The Department of Energy isn’t too fond of EV manufacturing or clean energy, and it’s been slashing funding once awarded to big companies to make new stuff. In fact, it’s taken the axe to 233 projects that it’s dubbed part of “the left’s climate agenda.”

That includes big projects and awards for General Motors and Stellantis. A whopping $500 million for GM to convert a manufacturing facility to EV is now gone. Likewise, a $335 million grant for Stellantis to do something similar at its Belvidere, Ill. plant is also gone. The worst part is, that nothing has officially been confirmed, but just ascertained via a list that fell into the hands of journalists, analysts and politicians.

There are two lists, the second of which has the cancellations from Stellantis and GM. From Automotive News:

A day later, the department said in a news release that the DOE terminated 321 financial awards supporting 223 projects totaling $7.56 billion.

“Following a thorough, individualized financial review, DOE determined that these projects did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs, were not economically viable, and would not provide a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars,” it said.

Analysts told Automotive News that the Department of Energy did not release the first list of terminated projects. However, the news outlet Latitude Media obtained the list and published it online.

That first list of terminated projects includes investments in hydrogen, industrial decarbonization and transmission and distribution of electricity.

Days later, the second list appeared.

This is not great news, especially for automakers that desperately need the cash to help offset the great losses from EV sales and manufacturing. Unfortunately, it doesn’t seem like the Trump Administration is all that interested in making sure the U.S.’s manufacturing stays globally competitive, instead opting to mire itself in weirdly partisan politics. We're in for a strange couple of years.

90% Polestar Closes Up Shop in China (Sort Of)

Polestar certainly hasn’t fared all that well in China. That’s interesting, the brand has started to find its roots globally, increasing sales in European and American markets, but it’s been a non-starter in China. Just a few weeks ago, we reported on how it closed all of its stores but one, and had a dismal 69 cars sold in China for the whole first half of the year.

Well, it looks like Polestar is kind of done in China. It’s shifting to an entirely online business model, and it has closed its last store, once located in Shanghai. Oof. From CarNewsChina:

Polestar officially closed its final direct sales store in the Chinese market. The store was located at L+Plaza in Qiantan, Shanghai, according to Auto-home. The company stated that this move is part of a strategic adjustment to its China business model. It emphasized that other operations in the country, as well as customer rights, remain unaffected. Polestar now primarily sells its vehicles through online channels.

Now, Polestar still has more models coming for the rest of the world. The Polestar 5, as well as the Geely-based Polestar 7 are still on the way, even if they won’t make their debut in China. Polestar still exists in China, and is very much a part of China's Geely group—but it looks like the brand is pivoting to focus more on its successes elsewhere across the globe.

100% Did You Cash In On the EV Tax Credit?

The IRA is over. But the deals are hard to deny; whether you were purchasing new or used, or rolling the $7,500 into a lease, the IRA brought the prices down for a lot of everyday people.

So, did you cash in before the Sept. 30 deadline? Or, was the IRA’s advantage not much of a selling point? Let us know about your car-buying choices this year, or what's on the horizon for you, by dropping a note into the comments.

This surge is fuelled by the aggressive expansion of Chinese manufacturers, who dominate the market. The largest 25 manufacturers tracked by Enerdata show combined PV modules shipments increasing from 172 GW in 2021 to 687 GW in 2024, a 300% increase in 4 years1.

For several years, the Chinese companies have been dominating the manufacturing and supply of solar panels with only 1 or 2 maximum of non-Chinese companies make it to the list of 10 manufacturers. In 2024, the top 10 companies by modules shipment stayed unchanged compared to 2023, with some players trading placed. The top four players sustained their positions from 2023 while growing their overall shipments. Jinko Solar maintains its 1st place with shipments increasing from 79 GW to 93 GW, followed by Longi, which increased its shipments from 68 GW to 78 GW. Both Trina Solar and JA Solar share the 3rd place with shipments of 77 GW each. Canadian Solar retreated from the 5th position in 2023 to the 7th place in 2024 with an identical shipment volume of 31 GW in both years. TW Solar (Tongwei) and Astronergy (Chint) moved up to the 5th and 6th places with 49 GW and 40 GW module shipments, respectively. GCL (25 GW), Risen Energy (25 GW), and DAS Solar (23 GW) completed the top 10 by modules shipments.

Figure 2: Historical Modules Shipments in GW

The top 10 achieved an average shipment volume increase of 27% between 2023 and 2024, except for Risen Energy, whose shipments decreased by 4%. The highest annual shipment increase is achieved by TW Solar (+69%), followed by GCL (+52%) and Astronergy (+43%). Beyond the top 10 by modules shipments, other notable manufacturers achieved significant shipments in 2024, such as Yingli (20 GW), DMEGC (17 GW), First Solar (14 GW), and Seraphim (12 GW). The shipments of the following companies are below the 10 GW threshold 1.

As of total market share based on PV modules shipments, Jinko Solar leads with 13%, followed by Longi, Trina solar, and JA Solar, each with around 11%. The next tier includes TW solar (7%), Astronergy (6%), Canadian solar (5%), GCL and Risen Solar (4%), and DAS Solar (3%). Beyond the top 10, notable manufacturers include Yingli (3%), DMEGC (2%), First Solar (2%), Seraphim (2%), while the remaining 16% (107 GW) is held by other manufacturers.

Figure 3: PV Modules Shipment & Market Share (GW; 2024)

The industry is growing rapidly, and operational production capacity is expanding accordingly. In addition to existing capacity, numerous players are planning or constructing large-scale production facilities, continually increasing their output and diversifying their manufacturing base across several countries—a strategy likely aimed at overcoming trade barriers. For example, Jinko is planning a 3 GW solar module production facility in Vietnam, as well as a 10 GW cell and module facility in Saudi Arabia. Similarly, JA Solar has announced a 3 GW facility in Oman and a 2 GW facility in Egypt, while Longi is developing a 1.6 GW facility in Indonesia, among others 2&3.

In 2024, the top 10 manufacturers by module shipments collectively reached over 805 GW of production capacity, with combined module shipments amounting to 517 GW. This resulted in a 65% utilisation rate, which, despite appearing low, represents an improvement compared to 2023, when the utilisation rate for the same top 10 manufacturers was 59%. The highest utilisation rate in 2024 was achieved by GCL (83%), followed by Trina Solar and JA Solar (77%). The lowest utilisation rates were recorded by Canadian Solar and Longi, both with 52%. Notably, Canadian Solar added 3 GW of production capacity while maintaining the same shipment volume as in 2023. Longi significantly expanded its production capacity by 30 GW (+25%) in 2024, though its module shipments grew by only 15% compared to 2023. Longi remains the largest manufacturer in terms of production capacity with 150 GW, followed by Jinko Solar with 130 GW.

As competition intensifies, profit margins are shrinking for most key players, who struggle to maintain healthy profitability while simultaneously investing in R&D and production expansion. Continuous price declines and aggressive competition restrict companies’ ability to manoeuvre and balance their finances. In 2024, Zhejiang Akcome Photoelectricity Technology filed for bankruptcy, citing an inability to meet debt obligations4 .

With average selling prices for utility-scale modules hitting historic lows—dropping to $0.08–$0.10 per watt— manufacturers across the board felt a severe margin squeeze5 . One source reports that the top 10 module manufacturers suffered combined losses of $4 billion in 2024, amid year-over-year revenue declines. A recent report employed the Altman Z-Score6 , according to which six of the top 10 manufacturers—including Jinko, Longi, Trina, Astronergy, TW Solar, and JA Solar—fell into the grey zone, showing worsening financial health compared to the previous year, with the exception of Jinko, which improved its score in 2024.

Focusing on the largest players, the top five manufacturers experienced significant revenue declines in 2024 versus 2023, despite increased module shipments. Furthermore, all top five companies reported substantial losses in 2024, contrasting with their positive earnings or smaller losses in the prior year7.

Jinko Solar reported an operating loss of -$0.47 billion while revenues were $12.64 billion down 22.3%, gross profit $1.37 billion, down 47.4% and gross margin of 10.9% down 5.1%8. Longi’s revenue hit $11.5 billion down 37%, net loss $1.3 billion compared to profit of $1.75 billion and a growth margin 7.4%9 . Trina made a revenue of $11.15 billion a decrease 30%, loss of -$0.26 billion compared to earnings of 2023 of $1.10 billion10 . JA Solar gained a revenue of $9.7 billion a decrease 18%, loss of -$0.65 billion compared to $1 billion earnings in 202311. Tongwei achieved a revenue of $12.8, a decrease of 51%, loss of - $1.2 billion compared to losses of - $1 billion in 202312.

Reshuffling production bases

The market continues to feature a rapid cycle of innovation and technology deployment with technologies like TOPCon, HJT, and IBC achieving higher efficiency compared to older technologies13. Companies invest considerable amounts on innovation and new technologies to ensure their survival in the competition landscape. Some estimates put industry average R&D investments at 4%14. However, these investments increase financial pressure with only marginal impact on the market. Coupled with overcapacity and continuous expansion, this creates downward price pressure, leading to fierce competition for market share at the expense of profitability. Meanwhile, the market actually seeks standardised, certified, mass-produced, and stable modules.

Striking this fine balance between these different dynamics is what differentiates successful companies. For the European market, brands must not only provide efficient modules but also meet stringent regulations, be responsive to local EPCs, and participate in public tenders, with failure to do so raising project complexity. Furthermore, European and American markets are gradually transitioning to favour locally produced components, with considerable strategies advocating local production increasing barriers on imports. These two markets still see locally produced modules prices higher than Chinese imported modules, even after levies and import taxes. This is attributed to the extensive integration of the Chinese solar industry value chain, the massive production scale, and the size of local demand in China, which absorbs a considerable percentage of the production.

Europe and the USA Manufacturing Evolution

Escalating trade wars—particularly between the USA and China—have introduced trade barriers and increased import levies. Moreover, growing concerns over supply risks and trade imbalances that could be weaponised as political leverage have contributed to a resurgence of local solar manufacturing. Both Europe and the USA have announced substantial new solar PV production capacities. At the same time, Chinese companies have dispersed some of their new production facilities across multiple countries to circumvent trade barriers targeting Chinese products.

The Net Zero Industry Act (NZIA) sets an ambitious target for the European Union: achieving 30 GW of domestic solar photovoltaic (PV) manufacturing capacity across the entire value chain by 2030. Building this capacity represents a significant challenge. According to Enerdata, the EU currently operates around 60 plants producing PV modules, with a combined manufacturing capacity of 8.4 GW. However, over the past two years, approximately 2.4 GW of capacity has been shut down, and an additional 2.7 GW has been put on hold15.

Despite these setbacks, more than 50 GW of additional PV module manufacturing capacity has been announced for completion by 2030. Notable projects include AE Solar in Romania, Siliconvalen in Spain, and Holosolis in France. Furthermore, around 20 GW of ingot and wafer manufacturing capacity has also been announced. The question remains whether these announcements will translate into operational factories.

However, these potential production capacities are far from meeting the increasing demand of solar PV installation in Europe that reached 65 GW16 in 2024 and projected to reach between 81 GW and 112 GW in 2028. Similarly, on a larger energy scale, according to Enerdata’s Enerfuture scenarios17 & 18. According to Enerfuture, by 2030 the share of renewables in the European primary energy could reach 18%, 23% or 28% according to the scenario. This implicated an installed solar energy capacity of 2.6 thousands GW, 3.5 thousands GW or 5 thousands GW respectively. These capacities are far from the 2024 installed capacity of 338 GW 15.

In Q3 2024, the United States reached a record-breaking 9.3 GW of new solar module manufacturing capacity. Five new or expanded factories in Alabama, Florida, Ohio, and Texas brought the total U.S. solar module manufacturing capacity to nearly 40 GW19. In the same quarter, First Solar and Runergy opened a 3.5 GW and 5 GW PV modules facility, respectively, both located in Alabama. The NREL estimates the available nameplate production capacity in the USA at 50 GW as of 2024209.

U.S. Solar Market Insight Q4 estimates that the USA currently has 24.1 GW of PV module production capacity under construction, and another 13.1 GW announced. Within 2024, the country brought online 24 GW of new module production capacity, a momentum spurred by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA)21. However, the Trump administration has tightened renewable energy tax credit and rescinded the designation of solar manufacturing as critical to national security. As such, the industry stays alert to these changes and potential negative impacts on the industry22.",https://d1owejb4br3l12.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/images/solar-market-H.jpg,N,,2025-10-15 13:09:21.316265

In September, Congress ended a Biden-era program providing a $7,500 tax credit for purchasing an electric vehicle.

General Motors followed the trend of government rather than consumer sentiment, and now it's scrambling to adapt when the government changes hands.","Sales of electric vehicles (E.V.s) surged in August and September as buyers took advantage of a federal tax credit before it expired. Now, automakers expect to sell fewer E.V.s—and lose money on them—for the rest of the year.

It raises the question, Is the American E.V. market just a creation of government policy?

""General Motors said it is reducing its electric-vehicle manufacturing capacity and booking a $1.6 billion charge on its EV business as demand sinks,"" reports The Wall Street Journal's Sharon Terlep. ""In a regulatory filing, the company said that EV sales are expected to fall with the end of government-funded subsidies and regulatory mandates that fueled EV growth.""

This was a monumental shift within just a few years: In 2021, General Motors CEO Mary Barra announced the auto giant would phase out all gas-burning vehicles by 2035.

Under the Biden administration, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) adopted emissions rules that would effectively require more than half of all new vehicles produced by 2032 to be electric. The agency rescinded those rules in March, after President Donald Trump reentered office.

In September, Congress ended a Biden-era program providing a $7,500 tax credit for purchasing an electric vehicle. Motorists apparently flocked to dealerships ahead of the program's sunset date, but analysts expected demand to plummet once the credit went away. ""The demise of the tax credit will probably bring the party to an end,"" Neal E. Boudette wrote last month in The New York Times. ""Sales of electric models are expected to plummet in the last three months of the year and then remain sluggish for some time.""

To be clear, slow electric vehicle sales are not General Motors' only problem, or even the biggest drag on its profits: The tariffs Trump has imposed by fiat are hurting the automaker's bottom line, as well. As Terlep noted, the $1.6 billion E.V. charge ""comes on top of an estimated $4 billion to $5 billion that GM projects it will pay in tariff-related costs this year."" Just in the second quarter of this year, Ford Motor Co. paid $800 million in tariffs and posted its first quarterly financial loss since 2023.

Still, General Motors' announcement supports the concern that without infusions of taxpayer money, E.V.s are not entirely viable on their own. It's no wonder, since they have not been driven by consumer preference.

From the start, the Biden-era rules prioritized all-electric vehicles over hybrids, which the EPA estimated would account for only 16 percent of all new vehicles sold by 2032. (For comparison, it estimated there would still be nearly twice that many cars with internal combustion engines.) But consumers have made it clear that if they get rid of their gas-burning cars, they're more comfortable with a hybrid than an electric.

""While EV sales are growing, their pace is falling well short of the industry's ambitious timetable for transitioning away from combustion engines,"" Tom Krisher of the Associated Press reported in 2023. ""Instead, buyers are increasingly embracing a quarter-century-old technology whose popularity has been surging: The gas-electric hybrid, which alternates from gas to battery power to maximize efficiency.""

In its 2024 annual consumer survey, the American Automobile Association (AAA) found similar results: While only 18 percent of respondents said they were likely to buy an electric, 31 percent were open to a hybrid.

""Access to a hybrid vehicle lessens the anxiety for consumers because it allows people to enjoy the benefits of electrification without feeling like they are disrupting their current lifestyle or travel plans (longer distance driving, less charging options, etc.),"" AAA noted of its findings.

Even though federal incentives have nudged them in other directions, automakers have tried to follow consumer sentiment. In August 2024, Ford announced it was shifting focus from electrics to hybrids. The automaker had separated its production lines into traditional and electric divisions just two years earlier, and since then, ""Ford's electric vehicle division has lost $12 billion, including $2.2 billion in the first half of this year,"" the Times reported in August.

In January 2024, Toyota chairman Akio Toyoda predicted all-electric vehicles would only ever make up about 30 percent of the total automotive market. Instead, Toyoda advocated a ""multi-pathway approach"" to cutting carbon emissions on the road, and said ""customers, not regulations or politics,"" should drive innovation.

Toyoda is right. General Motors followed the trend of government rather than consumer sentiment, and now it's scrambling to adapt when the government changes hands.",https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2025/10/general-motors-gm-building-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-15 12:12:26.238408

In a regulatory filing, GM indicated that the adoption rate of EVs is anticipated to decline following the cessation of certain consumer tax incentives and the relaxation of emissions regulations.

The EV tax credit, which provided up to $7,500 for new vehicles and $4,000 for used ones, expired last month.

The company outlined that the charge will encompass non-cash impairment and other costs totalling $1.2bn, attributed to adjustments in EV capacity.

Additionally, GM expects to incur $400m in expenses primarily associated with contract cancellations and commercial settlements linked to its EV investments.

It has cautioned that further financial impacts may arise as it continues to reassess its EV capacity and manufacturing footprint, including investments in battery component production.

The automaker stated that it is “reasonably possible” it will recognise additional material cash and non-cash charges that could negatively influence its operational results and cash flows.

Despite these adjustments, GM clarified that the realignment of its EV capacity will not affect its current retail offerings, including the Chevrolet, GMC, and Cadillac EV models that are already in production.

Last month, GM decided to scale back production at one of its key EV manufacturing facilities.

A report from Reuters indicated that the company will temporarily halt production of two electric Cadillac SUV models at its Spring Hill, Tennessee plant in December, responding to the reduced federal support for EVs under the current administration.

The energy sector across Europe has seen significant increases in renewable energy production that can be attributed to a variety of factors. Leading the charge is the exceedingly hot weather in Europe, which has resulted in an increase in renewable energy generation.

Industry insiders have noted the increased generation from the renewable energy sector in Europe

For far too long, the world has relied on the conventional energy sector to meet energy demands. That reliance has had a disastrous impact on the global environment, as climate disasters become an all too real result of the world’s proclivity for non-renewable energy sources.

As the climate problems have become too significant to ignore, the world’s leaders have laid out their nations’ plans to reduce reliance on the non-renewable energy sector in favor of the renewable power that solar and wind present. What we must remember is that this transition will not take place overnight, but we can take solace in the fact that most nations across the world have made significant steps towards realizing a future where renewable energy is the dominant force in the sector.

Solar power leads the charge, with wind power set to see significant increases by the year 2030

The general acceptance and embrace of the renewable energy sector seen in Europe has been a welcome change from the status quo. A report from the University of Surrey noted that solar energy is the cheapest source of power on the continent.

That report stated that in June of this year, solar power became the EU’s largest source of electricity, outpacing the conventional oil and gas sectors substantially. The report also noted that wind power started the summer strong, with the highest ever generation for the months of May and June.

During this year alone, wind farms generated 16.6% (33.7 TWh) and 15.8% (32.4 TWh) of EU electricity during May and June, respectively. This astonishing turnaround in the European energy sector aligns with the global calls for a reduction in the coal and gas sectors.

Wind power is set to continue to increase and could potentially outpace its solar-powered cousin in the renewable energy sector. When that does happen, wind power will become the dominant force in the energy sector. Coal and gas have seen a significant reduction in production due to a myriad of mitigating factors, including the war in Ukraine and the rise in AI-driven data centers in the United States.

The global proclivity for wind power has seen several countries investing vast amounts of money in new wind farms, further accelerating the transition to the renewable energy sector globally. A prerequisite for the global calls for decarbonization is to invest heavily in both the wind and solar power sectors.

The political leaders in the United States have been urging the global energy sector to embrace the potential that the renewable energy sector presents.

“I strongly agree with Vice President Gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence, but must fast-track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power, wind power and advanced biofuels…” – Former US President Barack Obama

A second proposed lease sale under Trump — 440 million tons of coal near an NTEC mine in central Wyoming — was postponed last week following the low bid received in the Montana sale.
In documents submitted in the run-up to the Montana sale, NTEC indicated the coal had little value because of declining demand for the fuel.","BILLINGS, Mont. (AP) — Federal officials rejected a company's bid to acquire 167 million tons of coal on public lands in Montana for less than a penny per ton, in what would have been the biggest U.S. government coal sale in more than a decade.

The failed sale underscores a continued low appetite for coal among utilities that are turning to cheaper natural gas and renewables such as wind and solar to generate electricity. Emissions from burning coal are a leading driver of climate change, which scientists say is raising sea levels and making weather more extreme.

President Donald Trump has made reviving the coal industry a centerpiece of his agenda to increase U.S. energy production. But economists say Trump's attempts to boost coal are unlikely to reverse its yearslong decline.

The Department of Interior said in a Tuesday statement that last week's $186,000 bid from the Navajo Transitional Energy Co. (NTEC) did not meet the requirements of the Mineral Leasing Act.

Agency representatives did not provide further details, and it's unclear if they will attempt to hold the sale again.

The leasing act requires bids to be at or above fair market value. At the last successful government lease sale in the region, a subsidiary of Peabody Energy paid $793 million, or $1.10 per ton, for 721 million tons of coal in Wyoming.

President Joe Biden's administration sought to end coal sales in the Powder River Basin of Montana and Wyoming, citing climate change.

A second proposed lease sale under Trump — 440 million tons of coal near an NTEC mine in central Wyoming — was postponed last week following the low bid received in the Montana sale. Interior Department officials have not said when the Wyoming sale will be rescheduled.

NTEC is owned by the Navajo Nation of Arizona, New Mexico and Utah.

In documents submitted in the run-up to the Montana sale, NTEC indicated the coal had little value because of declining demand for the fuel. The Associated Press emailed a company representative regarding the rejected bid.

Most power plants using fuel from NTEC's Spring Creek mine in Montana and Antelope mine in Wyoming are scheduled to stop burning coal in the next decade, according to an analysis by The Associated Press.

Spring Creek also ships coal overseas to customers in Asia. Increasing those shipments could help it offset lessening domestic demand, but a shortage of port capacity has hobbled prior industry aspirations to boost coal exports.",https://img.ien.com/mindful/im/workspaces/default/uploads/2025/10/ap25287538260305.Gu15JjHRt2.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&crop=focalpoint&fit=max&fp-x=0.54&fp-y=0.51&q=70&w=1200,N,,2025-10-15 16:10:56.675119

A Living Lab for Carbon Efficiency

In Elkhart, Indiana, Amazon has transformed a delivery station into a testing ground for the next generation of sustainable logistics. Known internally as DII5, the site combines operations with an experimental framework—housing more than 40 market-ready technologies aimed at reducing emissions, energy use, and material intensity.

From the moment you approach the facility, the difference is visible. The building’s exposed timber interiors, vast glass windows, and 170 electric vehicle charging stations set a new tone for how e-commerce infrastructure can function in a low-carbon future.

“DII5 continues years of experimentation across Amazon’s real estate portfolio,” said Daniel Mallory, Amazon’s Vice President of Global Realty. “It brings together lessons learned from how we operate and how we build, and it will guide us as we move closer to our climate goals.”

Building Design as Climate Strategy

Globally, buildings and construction contribute nearly 40% of greenhouse gas emissions, according to the Carbon Leadership Forum. Amazon’s Climate Pledge—committing the company to reach net-zero carbon by 2040—places building innovation among its highest operational priorities.

The Elkhart station serves as a microcosm of that ambition. Its integrated systems measure performance across heating, lighting, materials, and energy use in real time. The company’s intent is not simply to operate one sustainable site, but to determine which design and operational models can be scaled across its logistics and fulfillment network worldwide.

Materials and Systems Under Test

Amazon’s design approach at DII5 moves beyond standard retrofits. Heat pumps replace fossil fuel–based systems, avoiding on-site combustion. Air curtains limit the loss of conditioned air at entryways, improving thermal comfort and reducing electricity demand.

Clerestory windows and large glazed openings allow daylight to replace much of the artificial lighting load. All installed lighting is LED-based, calibrated for efficiency and brightness uniformity across work zones.

Construction materials were chosen for their lower embodied carbon content. Interior walls use wooden studs in place of steel, paired with bio-based wood fiber insulation rather than fiberglass. An ultra-light, low-carbon drywall alternative was used throughout, while acoustic ceilings and flooring rely on renewable finishes.

Even Amazon’s signature “door desks” were reimagined—replaced with salvaged-wood versions supplied by Cambium, a company that upcycles reclaimed timber for commercial interiors.

Capturing Data for Global Application

Each system installed at DII5 is part of a feedback loop. Amazon’s facilities team will monitor emissions, energy, and comfort metrics to determine which technologies offer the best balance between cost and performance. Early findings are expected to influence upcoming builds and retrofits in Amazon’s growing logistics network.

“Buildings are not only operational assets—they’re climate assets,” said a senior facilities engineer involved in the project. “This site helps us quantify that value.”

Some of the early concepts tested at Elkhart are already being integrated into other Amazon facilities, particularly energy-efficient HVAC configurations and daylight-optimised design principles.

Beyond Elkhart: The Global Relevance

Amazon’s experiment arrives amid growing scrutiny of corporate building portfolios. The International Energy Agency has warned that without rapid decarbonization in the construction and real estate sectors, global net-zero targets remain out of reach.

By converting an operational delivery site into a full-scale testing environment, Amazon joins a growing list of multinationals—from Microsoft to IKEA—reassessing their real estate footprints as climate laboratories.

The lessons from DII5 could extend beyond logistics. If proven cost-effective, Amazon’s model of live testing and scalable adoption may serve as a prototype for how large corporates integrate ESG innovation into physical infrastructure.

For Amazon, the stakes extend far beyond one building in Indiana. The Elkhart project is designed to feed evidence-based decisions across thousands of facilities globally. As the company moves toward its 2040 net-zero commitment, what it learns here will help shape not only its own carbon trajectory but the emerging standards for sustainable industrial architecture worldwide.",https://esgnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Amazon-Tests-Next-Gen-Decarbonization-Strategies-at-New-Indiana-Facility.jpg,N,,2025-10-15 13:10:50.247628

In its Endangerment Finding One Pager, EPA states that “The 2009 Endangerment Finding was the first step in the Obama-Biden Administration’s (and later the Biden-Harris Administration’s) overreaching climate agenda.
Subsequent court decisions, even ones that invalidated specific EPA climate rules (such as the 2015 Clean Power Plan), have not reversed or undermined the ruling in Mass v. EPA.
Every one of EPA’s greenhouse gas regulations has been challenged in court, with exhaustive discussion of EPA’s legal underpinnings, technical analysis, cost-benefit analysis, and the scientific basis of the Finding.
There are lots of summaries available from different perspectives, and fact-checking posts such as EPA attacks climate science.","EPA is calling it the “largest deregulatory action in U.S. history.” The New York Times called it “President Trump’s most consequential step yet to derail federal climate efforts,” which “appears to represent a shift toward outright denial of the scientific consensus.” Others say that the proposal “rejects mainstream science and misunderstands the law” and “relies on misinterpretations of the law and recent cases, fringe science, and tortured cost analysis.” And that EPA is choosing “polluters over people.”

Whatever side of the science and policy issues you find yourself on, this proposal is big news. And rightfully so. The Endangerment Finding, which EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson issued in 2009 under Section 202(a) of the Clean Air Act, is the legal underpinning for the rules EPA has issued in the past 15 years that limit emissions of greenhouse gases from motor vehicles and has provided vital support for rules limiting greenhouse gas emissions from power plants, oil and gas operations, and landfills. Motor vehicles and power plants make up about half of US emissions; oil and gas operations are the largest single industrial source; and landfills are significant emitters of methane, a greenhouse gas more potent than CO2. If the proposal is finalized and withstands legal challenge, it could well preclude EPA from regulating greenhouse gases in the future (indeed, this is the objective of the rulemaking), meaning that the only way greenhouse gases could be controlled at the federal level in the United States would be if Congress passed a law either doing so itself or giving EPA specific new authority to do so.

In its Endangerment Finding One Pager, EPA states that “The 2009 Endangerment Finding was the first step in the Obama-Biden Administration’s (and later the Biden-Harris Administration’s) overreaching climate agenda. That agenda has imposed trillions of dollars of costs on Americans. For a generation, defenders of this agenda have avoided scrutiny of how it all began.” As someone who worked in EPA’s Office of Air and Radiation when the Endangerment Finding was issued and throughout the rest of the Obama Administration and then again during the Biden Administration, it is difficult to read statements like these without providing a response.

First Claim: Has EPA’s “climate agenda” been overreaching? Climate scientists around the world are increasingly in agreement that 1) anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions are the major cause of increased GHGs in the atmosphere; 2) that those increased GHGs are causing the earth’s surface to warm; 3) that the warming is affecting not just the “climate” (i.e., long term, geographically broad conditions of temperature, precipitation, wind speed, etc.) but also the “weather” (e.g., do I need an umbrella today? Are we having a hurricane or windstorm or heat wave today?). The Clean Air Act charged EPA with addressing “any air pollutant” that the Administrator determines “may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare,” and to set standards regulating the emission of that air pollutant from mobile sources. CAA Section 202(a)(1). The US Supreme Court decided in 2007 in Massachusetts v. EPA that greenhouse gases do fit within the term “air pollutant,” and EPA should therefore respond—in whatever way it determined was correct—to a petition asking the agency to regulate GHGs from motor vehicles under Section 202(a)(1). Subsequent court decisions, even ones that invalidated specific EPA climate rules (such as the 2015 Clean Power Plan), have not reversed or undermined the ruling in Mass v. EPA.

Second Claim: Has EPA’s regulation of GHGs imposed trillions of dollars of costs on Americans? EPA does not provide support for this statement, and I am hard-pressed to understand how it could be true. The Regulatory Impact Assessment for the GHG rules for powerplants finalized in 2024 calculated around $20B in costs for the power plant rule. For the 2024 motor vehicle rules, the cost was projected to be $40B. Cost-benefit analysis is both art and science, and the many choices agencies make about what costs to count and how to count them can dramatically change the outcome. What is clear in this rulemaking action, however, and in the “trillions of dollars of costs” statement, is that the EPA is choosing not to consider any of the benefits that have already been experienced by the American people or that will be in the future from less pollution and mitigation of climate change impacts. A CBS review of the Draft Regulatory Impact Assessment found that the Administration’s own analysis shows that if the current GHG standards were repealed as proposed, gasoline prices would increase, and nearly a half million jobs would be lost by 2035. The regulatory impact analysis shows, under its two most likely and realistic scenarios, that repealing the vehicle GHG standards would result in a cost of $260 billion dollars between 2027 and 2055 in one case and $350 billion dollars in net costs in the other.

Third Claim: Have “defenders of this agenda…avoided scrutiny of how it all began”? Not hardly. Every one of EPA’s greenhouse gas regulations has been challenged in court, with exhaustive discussion of EPA’s legal underpinnings, technical analysis, cost-benefit analysis, and the scientific basis of the Finding. EPA has kept pace with science over the years; the more recent rules have updated the facts on the ground and the predictions of future climate impacts. Indeed, the scientific record has grown ever more robust, with each year of record temperatures, runaway wildfires that affect air quality across massive areas of the US, and storms that take lives and destroy property. The Endangerment Finding has been examined in a sea of lawsuits and withstood each challenge. (See Inside Trump’s Renewed Effort to Undo a Major Climate Rule, Zraick and Friedman, NYT January 18, 2025).

We’ll see what happens this time. The proposal relies on several legal arguments for overturning the 2009 Finding, the passage of time, court decisions such as West Virginia v. EPA (major questions), and a draft report from the Department of Energy to support its conclusions that EPA does not have the authority to regulate greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act, did it wrong in 2009, and alternatively, that circumstances have changed such that a finding (and the subsequent regulation of emissions from mobile sources) is no longer warranted. There are lots of summaries available from different perspectives, and fact-checking posts such as EPA attacks climate science. Here are the facts. – E&E News by POLITICO, and I encourage you to read them. You may also want to read the report issued by the National Academies of Science on September 17, which focuses on climate science since 2009 and finds that “the evidence for current and future harm to human health and welfare created by human-caused greenhouse gases is beyond scientific dispute.”

Every day that goes by with more greenhouse gases emitted and the delay of available opportunities to shift to cleaner sources of energy makes it that much harder for society to manage what the future will look like.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15968_154.jpg,N,,2025-10-15 12:12:12.950568

Stellantis' operations in the U.S. include 34 manufacturing plants, parts distribution centers and research and development sites across 14 states.
In July, the Netherlands-based automaker reported half-year results that included losses of 2.3 billion euros (nearly $2.7 billion).
During the period, U.S. shipments were down by nearly a quarter as the carmaker reduced the importation vehicles produced abroad.
Shares in Stellantis fell sharply in after-hours trading after closing 4.8% lower during regular trading Tuesday.","Stellantis says it will invest $13 billion over the next four years to expand its manufacturing capacity in the United States, a move that the automaker says will increase its domestic vehicle production by 50% and add more than 5,000 jobs.

The world's fourth-largest carmaker said Tuesday the investment will support the introduction of five new vehicles, including a Dodge Durango to be built in Detroit and a midsize truck to be assembled in Toledo, Ohio. The new jobs will be spread across plants in Illinois, Ohio, Michigan and Indiana.

Stellantis, which was created 4½ years ago from the merger of Fiat Chrysler and PSA Peugeot, is hoping to counteract some of the expected 1.5 billion-euro ($1.7 billion) cost of tariffs this year on cars produced in Canada and Mexico by boosting North American profitability with new model launches like the discontinued Jeep Cherokee.

The new product launches will be in addition to 19 ""refreshed"" products across all U.S. assembly plants and updated powertrains planned through 2029, the company said.

""This investment in the U.S. — the single largest in the company's history — will drive our growth, strengthen our manufacturing footprint and bring more American jobs to the states we call home,"" CEO Antonio Filosa said in a statement.

Stellantis' operations in the U.S. include 34 manufacturing plants, parts distribution centers and research and development sites across 14 states.

Of the 16 million cars Stellantis produces for sale in the U.S. market, 8 million are made in domestic plants, and another 4 million in Canada and Mexico — all with a large number of U.S. components. Another 4 million are imported from Europe and Asia, with virtually no U.S. components.

In pursuit of a U.S. turnaround, Filosa is also relaunching in the second half of 2025 models that previous management nixed two years ago: a new Jeep Cherokee, which will be produced in Mexico and the popular ICE Dodge Charger.

Earlier this year, Stellantis also relaunched the Ram Hemi V8 because of dealer and customer demand.

In July, the Netherlands-based automaker reported half-year results that included losses of 2.3 billion euros (nearly $2.7 billion). During the period, U.S. shipments were down by nearly a quarter as the carmaker reduced the importation vehicles produced abroad.

RU4M brings together four of the nation’s top research institutions: Michigan State University, Michigan Technological University, the University of Michigan, and Wayne State University.
For the RU4M universities, sustainability is a top priority, recognized as such by presidents, researchers, staff, and students alike.
This year, RU4M launched the Livable Futures Initiative, a bold effort to catalyze cross-disciplinary research that helps Michigan communities thrive.
For example, Michigan State University is piloting bioreactors to reduce agricultural runoff.","Michigan is a state defined by its natural abundance and resilience. Our lakes, rivers and forests are woven into our identity, our economy and our future. Yet, this abundance also comes with responsibility. Communities across Michigan are facing mounting challenges: flooding in Detroit neighborhoods, failing dams in Midland, harmful algal blooms in Lake Erie, and pressures on our energy and transportation systems. Climate change, population shifts and economic disruption are no longer distant possibilities; they are realities shaping our present. At Research Universities for Michigan (RU4M), we believe the solutions to these challenges — and the opportunities they present — begin with collaboration.

RU4M brings together four of the nation’s top research institutions: Michigan State University, Michigan Technological University, the University of Michigan, and Wayne State University. Together, we represent one of the most research-intensive coalitions in the country, uniquely positioned to advance sustainability, innovation, and prosperity across our state and the Great Lakes region. For the RU4M universities, sustainability is a top priority, recognized as such by presidents, researchers, staff, and students alike. While acknowledging the significant challenges posed by current environmental and resource issues, the university community understands that the myriad technologies and talents required to build a sustainable future also represent a considerable economic opportunity for today’s innovators.

This year, RU4M launched the Livable Futures Initiative, a bold effort to catalyze cross-disciplinary research that helps Michigan communities thrive. This initiative is about more than solving problems. It’s about imagining and building futures where Michigan leads the world in sustainable solutions, leveraging our unique assets: abundant freshwater, engineering and manufacturing expertise, and a deep culture of innovation.

Investing in Seed Grants for Change

As part of this initiative, RU4M recently announced the Livable Futures – Water Collaboration Grants, a $400,000 seed funding program to support innovative, interdisciplinary research across our universities. These projects will tackle some of the most urgent questions facing our state:

How do we protect our lakes while meeting increased demand for potable water and wastewater management in growing cities and agricultural regions?

What strategies will help us manage coastlines and low-lying communities vulnerable to flooding?

How can we build a resilient “blue economy” that sustains shipping, energy, and fisheries while protecting ecosystems?

By design, these grants require collaboration across at least three RU4M universities, and preference is given to projects involving all four. This ensures we are not working in silos but instead leveraging the full breadth of expertise across institutions, whether in engineering, natural sciences, public health, or policy. Equally important, we are prioritizing projects that engage communities directly. Sustainability cannot be solved in labs alone. By incorporating stakeholder input from local governments, businesses, and residents, we can ensure the research is not just innovative but also practical, inclusive and responsive to Michigan’s real-world needs.

The Power of Collaboration

The scale of today’s challenges requires more than technical fixes. It demands new models of collaboration. Michigan’s four research universities collectively generate more than $1 billion in sustainability research every five years. By connecting these efforts, aligning agendas, and creating shared pathways for impact, RU4M multiplies the effect of every dollar invested. For example, Michigan State University is piloting bioreactors to reduce agricultural runoff. Michigan Technological University is developing new tools for resource management in tandem with engineering solutions. The University of Michigan is leading on water infrastructure resilience, while Wayne State researchers are working closely with Detroit communities on flooding solutions. Together, these efforts create a research ecosystem that protects the environment while fueling economic growth and job creation.

The idea that sustainability and economic prosperity need not be considered trade-offs and can, in fact, reinforce one another is what Matt Elliott, Blue Lakes Ideas Founder and former president of Bank of America Michigan, calls “The Power of &.” We agree and see examples in our work. Clean water protects public health, attracts families and businesses, and drives industries from recreation to shipping. Climate-smart infrastructure strengthens communities while reducing costly disasters. Innovation in clean energy and mobility not only generates environmental benefits but also drives the industries of the future.

Michigan’s Global Responsibility

Michigan sits at the center of one of the world’s greatest freshwater resources. Some have called us the “freshwater capital of the world.” But that abundance comes with responsibility. If managed wisely, Michigan can set the global standard for water innovation: how to protect, manage and leverage freshwater resources for both economic and environmental resilience.

This is not just about Michigan. Climate change and demographic shifts are already prompting families and businesses from across the country to look to the Great Lakes region as a place of stability and opportunity. With moderate weather, vast water resources, and strong infrastructure, Michigan could see significant population and investment growth in the coming decades. The question is whether we are ready. The Livable Futures Initiative is about ensuring that we are — not just reacting to challenges but leading with foresight.

Preparing the Next Generation

Another central goal of RU4M’s work is preparing students—the future leaders, scientists, and entrepreneurs who will carry this mission forward. Through incubators, accelerators, and entrepreneurial programs, RU4M universities are not only training students in cutting-edge research but also encouraging them to launch ventures that tackle sustainability challenges head-on. Already, one in five RU4M alumni become entrepreneurs, with many building startups in clean technology, advanced materials, and water innovation.

Equally, we are ensuring that university curricula reflect the skills industry needs. By listening to employers and aligning training with emerging fields, we are creating a talent pipeline ready to meet Michigan’s sustainability and economic development goals.

A Call to Action

The Sustainable Urban Design Summit provides an ideal backdrop for these conversations. This gathering of researchers, practitioners, policymakers, and community leaders underscores a central truth: no single sector can build livable futures alone. We need collaboration across institutions, across industries, and across communities.

Michigan has the assets, the talent, and the drive to lead the global conversation on sustainability. But leadership requires action. It requires investing in research and innovation today to secure the future we want for our children and grandchildren.

The Livable Futures Initiative is RU4M’s commitment to that future. It is an investment not only in Michigan’s resilience, but also in its prosperity and its role as a global leader. Together with universities, policymakers, businesses, and communities working hand in hand, we can ensure that Michigan’s future is not only livable but thriving.",https://detroitisit.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SUDS-2025-Sponsors-2.png,N,,2025-10-15 13:09:52.365829

Her passion for preserving forests — from the mountains to the coast — is unmistakable.

“Trees are amazing,” Cohen says with a smile. “Just think about the products we get from forests: building supplies, food, textiles. We can manipulate them to get what we need but still maintain their ecological integrity.”

With master’s and PhD degrees in forestry, Cohen has spent most of her career exploring how to conserve and sustainably manage our nation’s forests. Before joining the UNC Institute for the Environment in 2018, she worked with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) at Camp Lejeune, studying the resilience of coastal, estuarine, and forest ecosystems surrounding the military base.

“The DoD manages almost 30 million acres of natural resources, which often surprises people,” Cohen says. “The military uses those land and water resources for training, and that is very compatible with managing habitat and ecosystem services.”

Her deep-rooted love for forests hasn’t changed — but her toolkit has. Today, Cohen is just as enthusiastic about drones as she is about trees.

“Drones are a game-changer,” she says. “They allow us to collect data faster, safer, and often more accurately than traditional methods.”

When Cohen arrived at Carolina, she quickly realized that while many researchers were using drones, there was no centralized hub for training, equipment, or collaboration. So in 2021, she helped launch the Carolina Drone Lab (CARDNL) to harness aerial technology for tackling environmental challenges.

Now, CARDNL supports researchers across UNC-Chapel Hill and beyond, offering technical expertise and data solutions that elevate environmental research.

Cohen will be one of 26 participants at this year’s Research and Discovery Fair, part of University Research Week, on Wednesday, October 22 from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. at the FPG Student Union. The event showcases active research spaces across campus — all offering opportunities for students to get involved.

UNC Research Stories sat down with Cohen to learn more about her work and why hands-on research experiences are so important for students.

What’s the main goal of your research?

Our mission is to provide tools and actionable information to the people managing and stewarding our natural resources. The pitch is simple: Come and do important field work and collect data, fly drones, and help solve problems.

What projects are you working on now?

We have many projects, but I have a few favorites. One is studying how the moisture content in the understory plants longleaf pine forests changes over time. This is a major factor for determining if and how a prescribed fire is set and then how it behaves. You’d be surprised by how that moisture changes hourly. This project uses remote sensing — when aerial sensors obtain data — but is really based on traditional on-the-ground field work. Fire managers and modelers want that information.

The other project is working in the marshes and sea grass beds of Currituck Sound to understand their resilience and track changes over time from restoration efforts. These ecosystems have incredible social and economic benefits. We are using drones, machine learning, and remote sensing to help our partners manage those marshes. This work has applications across North Carolina and beyond.

What are the biggest challenges in your research?

Funding is always the biggest challenge, but once we acquire that, it’s logistics and planning. Sometimes, we work in challenging conditions and do intensive fieldwork like wading through marsh muck or working in severe heat. And the drones have lots of rules and regulations, which can be difficult to navigate. For example, you have to be able to see the drone at all times, which is super hard in a forest. And batteries definitely don’t last long enough.

What’s the most surprising discovery your team has made recently?

We’re seeing some early data showing a clear difference in how certain sections of bunch grasses — plants that benefit from fire, which removes dead vegetation and stimulates new growth — hold moisture. Specifically, the leaves near the ground and the flowering parts higher up dry out at different rates and have noticeably different moisture levels. It might sound like a small detail, but it can have a big impact when it comes to how fire behaves.

If your research could solve one big problem, what would it be?

A big interest of mine is getting rid of invasive species in forest habitats. They destroy biodiversity and ecosystem function and cost a shocking amount of money to control.

What’s the coolest tool you use in the lab?

It is hard to deny that our big drones are pretty cool. Folks are familiar with the smaller ones that tend to be more widely owned, but our biggest, heavy lift drone makes an impression with its size and the noise it makes when flying. It sounds like a helicopter.

Can undergraduate students get involved in your lab?

Some projects have funding built in to support student involvement, and we try to create those opportunities. Unfortunately, our field schedule for data collection often doesn’t jive with students’ class and semester schedules. But there is so much work to do in addition to field work and data collection like literature reviews, data entry, processing imagery, and analyzing data. It isn’t very glamorous, but these are critical parts of research.

What do students gain from working with you?

Students are immediately exposed to teams collaborating on research projects and independent work addressing parts of a project. We talk about natural resource challenges and management a lot, so there is broad exposure to that world, from attending meetings with collaborators to organizing projects to translating data. And while we might not be able to take a student to the field, we always make sure there is plenty of drone flying, map making, and a chance to take their FAA Part 107 test to become a certified drone pilot.

Share a specific anecdote of how a former student on your team took what they learned and applied it in the real world.

One is working with the Mojave Desert Land Trust to help identify conservation priorities and strategies to prioritize lands. Another is a graduate student who does remote sensing of surface water and ice.

The Hazardous Waste Subcommittee of the Association of State and Territorial Solid Waste Management Officials (“ASTSWMO”) sent a September 16th letter providing comments to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) for submission to the upcoming Hazardous Waste Electronic Manifest System (“e-Manifest”) Advisory Board meeting.

The Advisory Board meeting was held from September 23 – 25.

EPA had announced the e-Manifest Advisory Board meeting and also included in the Federal Register notice:

Charge Questions posed to the e-Manifest Advisory Board.

Background White Paper providing information on the issues to be discussed by the Board.

ASTSWMO describes itself as an organization representing the 50 States, 5 Territories and the District of Columbia whose mission is to enhance and promote effective State and Territorial programs and to affect relevant national policies for waste and materials management, environmentally sustainable practices, and environmental restoration.

The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) cradle-to-grave Hazardous Waste Tracking System attempts to ensure that hazardous waste is properly generated, transported, and treated or disposed. The cradle-to-grave system has always been a key component of RCRA.

Federal legislation enacted in 2012 tasked EPA with the development of a national electronic manifest system. Further, it authorized the federal agency to assess the cost of developing and operating an e-Manifest system from user fees. Such fees would be charged to those who use the hazardous waste manifest to track off-shipments of their waste.

The e-Manifest system is a national database that similarly tracks hazardous waste shipments. It was launched by EPA in 2009. The goal of the e-Manifest system is to improve access to higher quality and timely data while also saving time and resources for industry, state, and territorial programs.

ASTSWMO notes in its September 16th comments that the theme of the Advisory Board meeting is referenced as:

Accelerating the Future: Phasing out Paper Manifests to Unlock the Full Potential of e-Manifest.

ASTSWMO states that it has reversed its position regarding retention of use of paper manifests. It states that the organization:

…now supports the use of fully electronic manifests.

One stated reason for this position is the concern that because data quality issues persist, it believes that maintaining two separate systems is contributing is contributing to such problems and that a transition to fully electronic manifesting, with all entities providing an electronic signature is preferrable.

Additional points raised in the ASTSWMO comments include:

Coordinating with the U.S. Department of Transportation is necessary, as it appears to be one of the most significant impediments to achieving a fully electronic e-Manifest system (noting DOT requires a physical paper copy of the manifest to be in the transport vehicle).

If EPA chooses to sunset paper manifests and transition to a fully electronic system:

Facilities that are normally very small quantity generators but have an episodic event should be required to register with the e-Manifest system in order to retain records.

EPA should consider the impact of the paper sunset requirement on the use of voluntary manifests as contemplated in the e-Manifest Frequently Asked Questions.

Supports EPA requiring e-Manifest registration for all entities involved in the waste handling process, including the generator, transporter, and the designated facility.

Supports removing the existing paper-based manifest record-retention requirements (entities currently required to maintain a paper manifest should be obligated to establish and maintain electronic access to their manifest via the e-Manifest system).

Supports a delayed enforcement and compliance approach to sunset paper manifests.

Appreciates EPA’s acknowledgement of state regulators and providing user support and management of the user registration process.

Supports EPA hosting an e-Manifest User Conference as outlined in the Background White Paper.

Added work on e-Manifest information has stretched limited state program resources and may not be sustainable without revisiting funding levels or expectations of workload.

agrees with EPA’s proposal related to the replacement manifest as outlined in the Background White Paper in the event that the e-Manifest system becomes temporarily unavailable for electronic manifest tracking.

Supports the sunsetting of paper manifests to assist with the integration of e-Manifest and the Biennial Report.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15833_1120.jpg,N,,2025-10-15 12:12:22.204232

Earlier this year, FAS sounded the alarm that federal reductions in force, funding pauses and freezes, program elimination, and other actions were stalling or setting back national preparedness for extreme heat – just as summer was kicking into gear. The areas we focused on included:

Leadership and governance infrastructure

Key personnel and their expertise

Data, forecasts, and information availability

Funding sources and programs for preparedness, risk mitigation and resilience

Progress towards heat policy goals

With summer 2025 in the rearview mirror, we’re taking a look back to see how federal actions impacted heat preparedness and response on the ground, what’s still changing, and what the road ahead looks like for heat resilience. Consider this your 2025 State of the Heat.

2025 State of the Heat

The State of Summer: How Hot Was It and How Did Communities Cope?

Summer didn’t feel as sweltering this year as it has the past couple of years. That’s objectively true – but only because the summers of 2023 and 2024 were true scorchers.

Summer 2025 was still the third-hottest on record. High temperature records were shattered across the country. Eight states broke their all-time heat records for June, and in July almost the entire country – including Alaska – saw above-average temperatures. Temperature extremes continued into September. Places like the San Francisco Bay Area experienced their hottest temperatures of the year even as the season turned to autumn. In addition, humidity was a particularly potent threat. One hundred twenty million people experienced near-record humidity this summer alongside temperature extremes. Humidity and heat are a deadly combination because sweating is less effective when humidity is high, raising the risk of overheating and experiencing heat-related illness. This heat led to spikes in heat-related illnesses and hospitalizations, longer droughts, road buckling and damage, and even a federal energy emergency in June 2025.

Since January 2025, and continuing over the course of the summer, FAS’s Climate and Health team has been in regular touch with local and state government officials involved in heat preparedness, response, and resilience. These officials generally shared that heat management activities continued successfully in most places throughout the summer despite disruptions to federal funding and programs. Officials emphasized three specific developments that helped enable that continuity:

Tools like the National Weather Service’s HeatRisk tool remained functional. HeatRisk is a critical tool for subnational governments to understand risks, inform and coordinate partners, and design thresholds for emergency response alerts and actions. Further, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)’s Heat and Health Tracker, which monitors heat-related visits in emergency departments across the country, was brought back online following reversals in CDC reductions in force.

Some key sources of federal funds, like American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) funding, remained available. Many local governments – particularly in places without large emergency management programs and Hazard Mitigation Assistance Program (HMGP) funds – have used ARPA funding to support heat response.

Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) funding was released after considerable advocacy from the external community and members of Congress. This funding is critical to support home energy assistance for cooling bills.

Yet this continuity is fragile:

The future of the National Integrated Heat Health Information System (NIHHIS) and the CDC’s Climate and Health program remains uncertain and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and CDC have faced notable staffing cuts and could face more cuts, jeopardizing the maintenance and existence of tools like HeatRisk and the Heat and Health Tracker.

Officials are also concerned about their ability to keep robust heat response programs going in a more austere funding landscape. For example, ARPA funding must be spent by December 31, 2026, and many officials are expecting a steep funding cliff that could lead to cuts to heat-related programs. We are already seeing evidence of this in Miami-Dade County, which eliminated its Chief Heat Officer position as a part of an effort to close a $400 million funding gap that emerged in part as ARPA funds were exhausted. Additional cuts to, and restrictions on, federal health preparedness programs and emergency management programs will also impact the staffing capacity of state and local governments. For example, one of the state officials FAS was working with on heat lost their job because of state budget shortfalls, and others have worried about their future job security.

Finally, while the LIHEAP program is currently intact, and has bipartisan support in Congress, it could be undermined by Executive Branch pocket rescissions and reductions in force.

The State of Federal Heat Governance: What Changed?

The federal heat landscape continues to be highly dynamic. While extreme heat is no longer a stated priority of the federal government, both this Administration and Congress have acknowledged heat’s risks. Against this backdrop, federal agencies are advancing a mixed bag of heat-related policies. For example:

The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) continues to pursue a heat rule. This rule, which was initiated under the Biden Administration and is a top priority for worker advocates, was included on the Trump Administration’s Unified Agenda as a regulation in development. However, given comments made at summer hearings on this rule, recent reporting has hypothesized that OSHA may model the rule after Nevada’s newer and weaker “performance-based” standards. This rule includes no “trigger temperatures” above which certain protections are required. An evaluation of the Nevada rule’s effectiveness will be limited by cuts to the staff at the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), and less funding for NIOSH’s research.

The National Institutes of Health (NIH) recommits to research on extreme heat and health. The NIH’s Climate Change and Health (CCH) Initiative was reintroduced as the Program on Health and Extreme Weather (HEW). The HEW Program’s strategic framework eliminates language directly referencing climate change and greenhouse gases and aligns with the Department of Health and Human Services’ broader MAHA strategy. As both houses of Congress rejected cuts to the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), there could be funding available through NIEHS for studies on the outcomes of heat exposure, long-term health risks, and preventative measures.

The Government Accountability Office (GAO) says the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) needs to evaluate its role in addressing extreme heat. A recent GAO report recommended that FEMA improve its benefit-cost analysis for heat, identify heat mitigation projects it might fund, and evaluate its role in heat response – all recommendations from FAS’s 2025 Heat Policy Agenda. FEMA agreed to act partially on the recommendations, citing changes made to HMGP to make extreme heat projects ineligible for standalone funding as a barrier to full action.

The Department of Energy acknowledges heatwaves as a particular risk. In July, the Department of Energy published a report entitled A Critical Review of the Science of Climate Change. This report has been widely discredited for cherry-picking and misrepresenting scientific studies. However, it is notable that even as the report minimizes the risks of greenhouse gas emissions, it emphasizes the importance of taking action on extreme heat, stating that “heatwaves have important effects on society that must be addressed” and that “inability to afford energy leaves low-income households exposed to weather extremes”. While there are partisan disagreements on how to secure that affordable energy, the report demonstrates that heat risk is an area of consensus between the parties that merits further pursuit.

The ongoing government shutdown could be used by the Trump Administration to continue their mass firing of federal workers. With the status of Appropriations negotiations stalled, the Office of Management and Budget has asked agencies to prepare contingency plans, and has threatened mass layoffs of furloughed employees. Given that most heat-related activities are not statutorily authorized, this could lead to further cuts to the federal heat workforce. On Friday October 10th, hundreds of workers were laid off across Health and Human Services, including at the CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics and the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response.

Congressional actions are also shaping what’s possible for nationwide heat preparedness. To start, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) cut funding necessary to mitigate extreme heat’s impacts as well as respond to the negative health consequences of heat. Impacts include:

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act cut funding necessary to mitigate extreme heat’s impacts

Rescinding heat resilience grant program fundingRescinding $138 million from the Green and Resilient Retrofit Program, which went to affordable multifamily housing units to install cool roofs, heat pumps, distributed energy resources, and improved insulation and windows. Rescinding $192 million from the Climate Pollution Reduction Grant Program, which went to building improvements that lower energy bills and increased resilience. Rescinding $516 million from the Environmental and Climate Justice Block Grants, which went to community heat risk mitigation activities and technical assistance. Rescinding $101 million from the Urban and Community Forestry Grant Program, which went to tree canopy projects that mitigate both urban and suburban heat islands. Rescinding $2.4 billion from the Neighborhood Access and Equity Program, which went to urban heat island reduction. Ending and restricting tax credits for cooling infrastructure investmentsEnding the Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit and Residential Clean Energy Credit on December 31, 2025, which helped homeowners make their homes more resilient to the impacts of extreme heat. Ending the New Energy Efficient Home Credit and Energy Efficient Commercial Buildings Deduction on June 30, 2026, which helped developers build more resilient homes. Removing eligibility for projects that use battery components sourced from certain foreign entities of concern (FEOCs) for the Investment Tax Credit (ITC), which helped grid operators make investments in battery storage technologies. Ending wind and solar as qualifying projects for the ITC and Production Tax Credits on July 4, 2026, which were going towards putting new energy on the grid. Restrictions and cuts to health funding to prepare for heat events and respond to heat illnessesSetting new limits on Section 1115 Demonstrations of Medicaid to require proof of cost-neutrality. States are using these waivers to cover things like air conditioners as a medical expense. Combined with the March 2025 rescission of the “health-related social needs” guidance and the phase out of funding for “Designated State Health Programs”, states may be limited in what preventative services they can offer. Changing health insurance policy (Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act) in ways that could lead to up to 16 million people to lose healthcare coverage. Less federal funding for health care will also have knock on effects. Low-resourced hospitals, such as those serving rural areas, may compromise their care or force some to close entirely.

Beyond OBBBA, Congressional appropriations proposals for Fiscal Year (FY) 2026 represent a mixed bag for federal heat policy. The House and the Senate proposals diverge in key ways, and will need to be rectified. Some of the things we are tracking include:

Congressional appropriations proposals for FY26 represent a mixed bag for federal heat policy

Funding levels for agencies that lead federal heat governanceNOAA: Both chambers fund the Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research, where NIHHIS is housed. Only the Senate’s appropriations proposal references NIHHIS and its critical role in heat governance and research CDC: The Senate provides full funding for the CDC’s Climate and Health program, while the House eliminates funding for the program. Both the House and Senate propose maintaining the National Environmental Public Health Tracking Network, which collects data on the health impacts of heat. Further, the Senate’s proposal calls on the CDC to improve tracking the costs of extreme heat as well as ensure public health departments are ready for disasters; meanwhile, the House’s proposal includes a provision that bars Health and Human Services from implementing any climate policies. Funding levels for partner agencies that drive heat-related data collection, research, and developmentNIEHS: Both chambers keep NIEHS at NIH and maintain FY25 funding levels. This rejects the proposed move of NIEHS to the Administration for a Healthy America and potential cuts that would co-occur with that move. NIOSH: Both chambers reject steep cuts to the agency, with the Senate even providing additional funding above FY25 levels. The Senate’s proposal also calls on the agency to improve its tracking of heat-related injuries and illnesses on the job. National Aeronautics and Space Administration: Both chambers retain FY25 funding levels for the agency. National Science Foundation: Both chambers reject the $5 billion dollar reduction in the agency’s funding, but the House still cuts $2 billion from FY25 funding levels of $9 billion. The House’s proposal also prohibits NSF funding from being used for the Global Change Research Program or the Clean Energy Technology Program, which could limit heat-related research. Funding levels for key heat preparedness grant programsLIHEAP remains funded at $4 billion in both the House and Senate proposals. The Senate’s proposal also includes a recommendation to review the LIHEAP formula, indicating an understanding of the growing need to address the costs of cooling. The Weatherization Assistance Program remains funded in the House’s proposal, though at a 45% reduction from FY24 funding levels, which will impact households. The Building Resilience in Communities Grant Program is reinstated in the House’s proposal, while adding restrictions that would make extreme heat projects ineligible. The Public Health Emergency Preparedness Cooperative Agreement is flat funded, maintaining funding for public health departments to do disaster response. The Hospital Preparedness Program is funded at $309 million in the Senate’s proposal and only $65 million in the House’s proposal. This is all while both proposals identify a need to address shortages in the emergency medical services workforces which could jeopardize health preparedness in the face of disasters. New heat-related policy and funding actionsThe House’s Agriculture Appropriations bill commits $400,000 to support bovine health, breeding, and genetics research related to heat stress mitigation. The Senate’s Agriculture Appropriations bill includes provisions to advance the science of dryland farming (tolerating heat and drought) and recognizes the importance of soil health to the resilience of crops to extreme heat. The House’s Energy-Water Appropriations bill calls on the Department of Energy to investigate the impacts of extreme weather events like heat waves, hurricanes, coastal and inland flooding, wildfires, and extreme droughts on U.S. energy systems. The House’s Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations bill calls on the Department of Defense to procure building materials that are resilient. This includes resilience to extreme temperatures. Finally, the House’s Transportation-Housing and Urban Development Appropriations bill calls on the Department of Transportation to ensure materials for federal infrastructure projects meet standards for durability and resilience.

State of the Future: What Comes Next for Heat Policy

Looking ahead, it is essential that the federal government maintains its role as a data collector, steward, and analyst, supports heat-related research and development, supports social services for the most vulnerable American households facing extreme heat. and continues to make investments in state, local, territorial, and tribal (SLTT) governments and their heat mitigation infrastructure and preparedness capacity. At the same time, SLTT governments are rapidly innovating in heat policy, and will be sites of innovation to watch this next year. Our team is tracking promising signs in three key areas:

More places are standing up heat governance infrastructure. A growing number of state, regional, and local plans acknowledge extreme heat as a risk; at the same time, more and more communities are developing standalone heat preparedness, response, or action plans (see heatplans.org to learn more, and read our “Framework for a Heat Ready Nation” to learn about progress in the Sunbelt region). New heat plans that launched in 2025 include Lincoln-Lancaster Heat Response Plan, the Low Country Heat Action Plan Toolkit, Orange County, NC’s Heat Action Plan, and King County’s Extreme Heat Mitigation Strategy. Many more plans are in the development pipeline. Further, more networks of local governments, including the Ten Across Network and Climate Mayors, are making heat technical assistance a priority.

More places are expanding their extreme heat protections. Policies that protect people from extreme heat exposure inside of their homes, inside of schools, and at the workplace are also starting to see uptake. LA County set an indoor temperature maximum of 82°F for rental units, creating a legal right to cooling for tenants. Meanwhile, the state of California recently enacted a law that all homes should be able to attain and maintain safe indoor temperatures, without specifying that limit. New Jersey now restricts utilities from shutting off the power due to non-payment from June 15 through August 31; New Jersey is also providing direct utility relief to New Jersey ratepayers. New York State became the first state in the country to regulate extreme heat in schools, setting a maximum temperature threshold of 88F for safe school operations. Finally, in Boston and in New Orleans, ordinances passed that require basic protections from heat, like rest breaks, for all city workers and city contractors. Scaling up these policies that minimize heat overexposure will be critical to be ready for hotter heat seasons to come.

Regional networks are forming to advance evidence-based public health measures. In light of rollbacks to public health infrastructure at the federal level, two regional networks have formed to coordinate across state public health departments, the West Coast Health Alliance and the Northeast Public Health Collaborative. While the initial focus is on developing evidence-based recommendations on vaccines and combining forces on vaccine procurement for their populations, we will be tracking how these networks address other public health efforts under threat, such as the health risks of extreme heat.

Protecting Americans from extreme heat will require a multiplicity of leadership across the levels of government in the United States and the capacity to connect hundreds of diverse organizations and experts around a shared solution set. To meet this moment, FAS will develop the 2026 State & Local Heat Policy Agenda, a blueprint for polycentric action towards a Heat Ready Nation. The 2026 Heat Policy Agenda will align the growing heat community around a shared set of objectives and equip state and local decision makers with the strategies they can deploy for heat season 2026 and beyond. We are focused on strategies that (1) build government capacity to address the threat of extreme heat and (2) ensure every American can be safe from heat in their homes, in their workplaces, and in their communities.

Over the next couple of months, the FAS team will be documenting the policy levers available at the state and local levels to address extreme heat and crafting model guidance, model executive orders, model legislation, and financing models.

Kiggans and Milito noted that more than 35 vessels have already been built, and 23 more have been announced or are currently under construction.
“These aren’t theoretical investments,” explain Rep. Kiggans and Milito.
“That is precisely the kind of domestic production that both sides of the aisle should support,” Rep. Kiggans and Milito said.
“We must move quickly to ensure Americans have the power to meet surging electric demand,” Rep. Kiggans and Milito wrote.
Rep. Kiggans and Milito acknowledge that for the permitting legislation to pass in the Senate, it must clear the 60-vote cloture threshold.","“From the Gulf Coast to the waters off Virginia, offshore energy is powering our economy and strengthening national security… Right now, companies want to invest across a range of technologies: oil and gas, wind, carbon capture, hydrogen, nuclear, geothermal and deep-sea mining. These projects represent billions in private investment, hundreds of thousands of jobs and the next generation of U.S. energy leadership,” reflected Rep. Jen Kiggans (R-VA-02) and National Ocean Industries Association (NOIA) President Erik Milito in an op-ed published in The Hill. “But if we want this momentum to last through future administrations, we must fix our broken permitting system.”

In the opinion piece, the authors reflected on the country’s potential for energy leadership. Offshore energy development is spurring domestic investment along the nation’s coasts, which Rep. Kiggans and Milito label “a story of industrial revitalization.” They highlight shipbuilding as an industry that has particularly benefited from this trend. As of the end of last year, the Oceantic Network totalled $1.8 billion in American shipbuilding contracts to support the offshore wind industry, creating more than 3,000 jobs for workers such as steelworkers and welders. Rep. Kiggans and Milito noted that more than 35 vessels have already been built, and 23 more have been announced or are currently under construction.

A significant amount of investment is also flowing into America’s ports along the East and Gulf coasts. Of the $12 billion in announced investments into America’s offshore wind industry, the American Clean Power Association (ACP) calculated nearly $3 billion to be allocated for ports. The Virginia Port Authority alone spent $223 million to upgrade the Portsmouth Marine Terminal with the help of a $20 million grant from the U.S. Department of Transportation. These upgrades enable Dominion Energy to transport equipment and infrastructure to its 176-turbine Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project, located approximately 27 miles offshore.

“These aren’t theoretical investments,” explain Rep. Kiggans and Milito. “They are real, made-in-America projects rebuilding our industrial base, reinforcing supply chains and strengthening maritime capabilities.”

Meanwhile, Wood Mackenzie estimates that deepwater oil producers in the Gulf will add 300,000 barrels per day this year and an additional 250,000 barrels next year. This uptick will swell production to more than 2 million barrels daily, a 40% increase since 2020. The National Ocean Industries Association (NOIA) reported in 2023 that the carbon intensity of production in the Gulf is 46% lower than the global average outside the U.S. and Canada, making it more environmentally friendly than other producing countries, such as Russia, China, Brazil, Iran, Iraq, and Nigeria.

“That is precisely the kind of domestic production that both sides of the aisle should support,” Rep. Kiggans and Milito said. “Offshore energy is not a zero-sum game; it’s additive. We need all forms of energy. Oil and gas projects in the Gulf can produce for decades, while offshore wind will continue to ramp up and build a reliable supply for other coastal areas.”

All of these forms of offshore energy will play a crucial role in addressing growing energy demand, which the authors attribute to a combination of population growth and the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. The International Energy Agency expects data centers to be responsible for nearly half of the growth in energy demand in the U.S. by 2030. By that time, they will consume more electricity than all energy-intensive manufacturing sectors combined. Virginia’s Loudon County, also known as “Data Centre Alley,” is just one region that will require as much secure and scalable power as possible, with 200 completed facilities spanning 49 million square feet. “We must move quickly to ensure Americans have the power to meet surging electric demand,” Rep. Kiggans and Milito wrote.

At the same time, Rep. Kiggans and Milito highlighted the various factors that contribute to long project development timelines and delays. For example, they explained that the deepwater oil projects in the Gulf can take at least a decade to plan and require billions of dollars of investment. “But both time and money depend on regulatory certainty. When that slips, so can production and investment in the U.S.,” they added.

They also acknowledged that although the intentions behind the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) were admirable, it now results in years-long delays stemming from administrative reviews and litigation: “The bottom line: projects stall, costs rise, investment dries up and America loses ground.”

The authors concluded that “we need bipartisan, durable and foundational permitting reform that protects U.S. energy leadership, provides legal certainty and ensures progress survives as presidents change.” They wrote that the bipartisan Streamlining Procurement for Effective Execution and Delivery (SPEED) Act “is a step in the right direction.” Introduced by Rep. Mike Rogers (R-AL-03), the provisions include limiting standing for civil actions to individuals who substantively participated in the public comment period and instituting a statute of limitations for NEPA cases.

Rep. Kiggans and Milito acknowledge that for the permitting legislation to pass in the Senate, it must clear the 60-vote cloture threshold. “Fortunately, there is broad agreement that the current system is broken and reform is overdue,” they said. “We have a bipartisan imperative to act. Smart, targeted reform will unlock offshore energy investments that generate billions in revenue, strengthen energy security, support high-wage jobs and ensure American leadership in a competitive global energy landscape.”",https://thebusinessdownload.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/483892016_641744858796298_4503683068630223356_n-1-e1760536533445.jpg,N,,2025-10-15 12:13:32.513441

""Responsible energy development on public lands strengthens America's energy security, powers our economy and supports state and local conservation efforts.""","Oct. 15 (UPI) -- The Trump administration has vowed to open up public land to usher in an age of American energy dominance but in the Western United States there is little frontier left.

More than 81% of public lands administered by the Bureau of Land Management in the Western United States are already open for oil and gas production leasing, according to a report by The Wilderness Society, a nonprofit organization focused on conservation.

The U.S. Geological Survey estimates that there is much more oil and gas that can be extracted from federally managed public lands, according to a report published in June. It estimates there are 29.4 billion barrels of oil and 391.6 trillion cubic feet of gas that are technically recoverable, meaning they can be produced using currently available technology and industry practices.

""This is an acceleration and amplification of what we saw in the energy dominance agenda under the first Trump administration,"" Ben Tettlebaum, director and senior staff attorney for the Wilderness Society, told UPI. ""What is distinct right now is its claim for wanting so-called energy dominance, particularly leveraging our shared public lands for that use. It seems it's trying to leverage that use above all others.""

The focus of President Donald Trump is not on the lower 48 states alone. Last week, Trump approved the Ambler Road project, a 211-mile industrial road that will cross the Gates of the Arctic National Park and Preserve.

The road will be used to enable trucks and equipment to access the Ambler Mining District, a region in Northwestern Alaska with copper, zinc, gold, lead and silver deposits.

The U.S. government has reached an agreement with Trilogy Metals, a mineral mining company based in Vancouver that operates in the Ambler Mining District. According to the White House and Trilogy Metals, the U.S. Department of War will invest $35.6 million in the company, making it a 10% shareholder as part of the agreement. It will also have the future option to purchase

Trilogy Metals is partnered with Ambler Metals in a joint agreement to mine in the Ambler district.

Last year, the Biden administration blocked the Ambler Road project. President Joe Biden said the project was blocked to protect 28 million acres of land and Native communities in Alaska.

The move by the Trump administration reverses course on Biden-era efforts to maintain public lands. It also marks the second high-profile instance of the U.S. government buying a stake in a private company under the Trump administration.

In August, the Trump administration purchased a 10% stake in chip manufacturer Intel.

The U.S. government has invested in private companies on rare occasions though the circumstances in this instance are unique. Notably those were domestic companies, unlike Trilogy Metals.

The government invests in American companies when there is a risk of those companies collapsing, such as banks and vehicle manufacturers during the Great Recession. Those investments were tied to a government interest: avoiding further economic hardship. They were also temporary investments with recipients of government assistance required to pay the government back.

In the case of the Ambler Road project, the White House cited a public interest in accessing critical minerals domestically.

""[American Petroleum Institute] continues to welcome the administration's efforts to restore a pro-development approach to land use and leverage our nation's vast resources,"" Tim Charters, director of upstream policy for the American Petroleum Institute, told UPI. ""Responsible energy development on public lands strengthens America's energy security, powers our economy and supports state and local conservation efforts.""

The Permian Basin in Southeast New Mexico and West Texas is a hotspot for oil drilling and industry experts told UPI it will see increased attention as the Trump administration invites more energy production.

Eli Hilbert, organizing director at Texas Permian Future Generations, told UPI residents of the basin are deeply tied to the oil industry. Most of them are supportive of the president's desire to increase production. Yet volatility in the industry ushered in by Trump's tariff and international policies is dragging down oil prices and causing layoffs.

""Oil was staying pretty steady at $70 to $72 a barrel until Trump announced tariffs,"" Hilbert said. ""Ever since it's been up and down between $70 and $55. They still support Donald Trump, who is leading energy in the direction of more layoffs and less drilling.""

ConocoPhillips announced last month that it will lay off about 25% of its workforce by the end of the year.

Earlier this year, Chevron announced it would lay off 15 to 20% of its workforce.

While jobs come and go as the oil market fluctuates, the effects of drilling are long lasting. If and when drilling ends at a site, maintenance of the drill site must continue indefinitely.

""We will need to maintain these oil wells forever,"" Hilbert said. ""There are tens of thousands in West Texas we're going to have to plug and check for millenia. We could employ every single person working in oil doing that for the next 100 years. The problem is there's no money in that.""

Hilbert adds that many who work in the oil business are not concerned with the environmental or health effects associated with drilling.

""The problem is people don't really live in Midland and Odessa [Texas] for long periods of time,"" Hilbert. ""It's a place you come, make your money and leave.""

Texans have seen what happens when abandoned oil wells are not plugged and maintained. The artificial lake, covering 60 acres of land, is filled with toxic water due to a leaking oil well. It spews hundreds of gallons of toxic wastewater per minute and has been doing so for more than 20 years.

""It smells terrible. It has dangerous levels of hydrogen sulfide,"" Hilbert said. ""Because nobody took care of it 20 years ago, it's ballooned into a huge problem.""

A struggle has persisted over the years to determine who is responsible for the cleanup. The Railroad Commission, the state agency responsible for regulating the oil and gas industry, and the county water district are in a dispute over which body is responsible for plugging the well.",https://cdnph.upi.com/sv/ph/og/upi/8411760534258/2025/1/3886f3146b270c653812c890efe4b5d8/v1.5/Most-public-land-already-open-to-energy-production-Trump-wants-more.jpg,N,,2025-10-15 12:13:36.199497

Second, this of course is not the only challenge we face in our energy system.
It is homegrown clean energy, which cannot be weaponised by dictators or petrostates, giving us much greater energy sovereignty.","Let me start by offering sincere thanks for Energy UK for hosting this conference.

And I want to thank Dhara [Vyas] for your leadership over the last year as CEO, can you join me in giving this tribute.

You are a brilliant champion of this industry.

Coming here today I am once again reminded that it is an incredibly exciting time for the energy sector.

Wherever you work, there is a sense of huge possibility for the future—and I want to thank you all for the work you are doing.

And I am incredibly proud of everything we have achieved together over the last 15 months, it has only been possible because of our work together, including:

Consenting record amounts of clean energy, enough to power the equivalent of more than 7.5 million homes—including just today Tillbridge solar farm, which alone will power hundreds of thousands of homes.

We are ending the first come first served grid connections queue.

Introducing the biggest reform of planning in a generation.

Setting up Great British Energy.

Investing in the biggest nuclear building programme in half a century.

And kickstarting our carbon capture and hydrogen industries.

None of this would have been possible without your advice, support and delivery.

All these achievements speaks to a wider purpose, which I believe unites so many people in this room.

Building our country’s clean energy future as part of a bigger vision of a fairer, more prosperous economy.

Soon we’ll publish our Clean Energy Jobs Plan, which will show not just the hundreds of thousands of good jobs that already exist in this sector, but also the hundreds of thousands of new jobs we expect to be created by 2030. This making a difference.

But of course, we also know that creating an economy for the many involves tackling the long-running cost of living crisis that so many people face.

And that’s what I want to focus on today.

We will be judged on the success of our mission in delivering for consumers, and rightly so.

My case today is this:

First, our exposure to fossil fuel markets remains the Achilles heel of our energy system, keeping bills high and giving us no long-term certainty over price.

Second, that we face further challenges of historic under-investment in our energy system and growing electricity demand. The choice for the future is therefore what kind of energy system we want to build, not whether we want to build it at all.

Third, building clean energy is the right choice for the country because, despite the challenges, it is the only route to a system that can reliably bring down bills for good, and give us clean energy abundance.

Fourth, as we build this new infrastructure, the government is determined to work with you to bring the benefits to families and businesses as quickly as possible.

First, memories can be short in Westminster.

But we should never forget the huge damage to family finances, business finances and the public finances caused by the energy shock we have been through in recent years—a shock that still reverberates today.

And the reason for this damage is because the UK was and is so exposed to international fossil fuel markets due to our dependence on gas across the economy.

Even today, wholesale gas costs for households are still 75% higher than before the energy crisis.

If they were at pre-crisis levels, bills would be more than £200 a year lower than they are today for families.

The same story applies to business.

Industrial electricity prices soared at the start of the energy crisis and have remained stuck at high levels.

So while it is true we have inherited a system of paying for network and other costs which is less weighted towards public spending than other countries, a large part of the issue facing industry in the UK is our exposure to fossil fuels.

As UK Steel said earlier this year when talking about why energy intensive industries like theirs pay higher electricity prices in the UK than our European competitors:

“The main driver of the price disparity is now wholesale electricity costs, driven by the UK’s reliance on natural gas power generation.”

Going back further, this has been a long-standing weakness at the heart of the British economy and society, with half of our recessions since 1970 caused by fossil fuel shocks.

And looking forward it remains a massive risk, particularly at a time of global instability.

According to the Office for Budget Responsibility, if gas price spikes occurred even once every decade, it could cost the UK between 2 to 3% of GDP annually.

So anyone who tells you we can solve the issues of energy security and affordability without addressing our reliance on fossil fuels seems to me to be ignoring the evidence before our eyes and this country’s painful recent experience.

Second, this of course is not the only challenge we face in our energy system.

In the years ahead, we expect a massive increase in electricity demand—around 50% by 2035 and a more than doubling by 2050.

This is a massive opportunity for us.

We want as a country to seize the opportunities of electric vehicles that are cheaper to run, new industries such as AI, and the benefits of electrification across the economy.

But this task is made harder by the legacy of decades of under-investment in energy in this country to overcome.

Whatever power sources they favour, people need to confront this reality.

Much of the UK’s current nuclear fleet began operating in the 1980s and we haven’t brought a new nuclear power station onto the system since Sizewell B 30 years ago.

At the same time, according to NESO, half the existing gas fleet has already been operating for over 20 years.

To listen to some people talk, you would think there was a free pass to just carry on using unlimited gas from existing stations for the next few decades, but that is simply not the case.

Of course, we could decide to stop building renewables and just rely on a whole new fleet of gas-fired power stations, but we need to be candid that this would involve the costs of building not just operating these plants.

And the underinvestment we face isn’t just about generation:

Much of the electricity grid was built in the 1960s and hasn’t been upgraded since.

So the reality is there is no alternative to investment in both generation and the network to keep the power system running and seize the opportunities and meet the needs of the future.

If the question therefore is not whether to build but what to build, the third part of my remarks is about why the government believes clean power is the right choice for the country.

Let’s be absolutely clear what the cheapest sources of power are in this country, according to levelised cost estimates.

Solar power and onshore wind.

Strike prices for solar and onshore wind in our last auction, AR6, were nearly 50% cheaper than the levelised cost estimate to build and operate a new gas plant.

Offshore wind, despite global cost pressures, was also cheaper than new gas.

At a systems level, the prize of a renewables-based system, supported by nuclear and other technologies, is clear:

It gets us off the fossil fuel rollercoaster, reducing our exposure as a country. Clean power 2030 will mean volatile gas sets the wholesale electricity price much less often than today.

It is homegrown clean energy, which cannot be weaponised by dictators or petrostates, giving us much greater energy sovereignty.

And it will significantly lower the wholesale costs of electricity, which will benefit heavy industry and has the potential to bring down consumer bills for good.

At the same time, of course, wholesale prices aren’t the only costs paid for by consumers, and we need to fund investment in energy infrastructure—including in the upgrade that is now sorely needed because of previous neglect.

In 2023 the previous government estimated four times as much transmission infrastructure needed to be built by the end of the decade as had been built since 1990.

That network infrastructure is what is now being delivered under this government.

Even taking this investment into account, the independent Climate Change Committee was clear in its Carbon Budget 7 advice:

“As the electricity system decarbonises, with wind and solar displacing unabated gas, the underlying costs of electricity supply are expected to fall over time.”

Of course, in this majority renewables system we are building, we will need a mix of energy technologies.

That is why we are driving forward on renewables, nuclear, storage, CCUS, hydrogen, and gas will continue to play an important backup role for some time to come.

Now as I have said, people are entitled to advocate for more fossil fuels and less, or even no more renewables as part of this mix.

But here is the reality:

They would leave us more exposed because we don’t control the price.

They are more expensive to build and operate.

They would leave us losing out in the global race for the jobs, investment and industries of the future.

And they would drive a coach and horses through our efforts to tackle the climate crisis.

That is why we believe that clean power is the right choice for the country.

And the task ahead is to bear down on the costs of building, which face significant upward pressures, and work relentlessly to translate the lower wholesale costs of clean power into lower bills for consumers.

As we face these challenges, we are looking at all the tools at our disposal:

How public investment can help reduce costs, as we are doing through Sizewell C, for example.

Using Reformed National Pricing to plan and build a more efficient system, which provides the right incentives to build the right generation in the right places. This is crucial to reduce constraint costs.

And relentlessly focussing on value for money in each and every decision, as we have done for example by halving the subsidy for Drax power generation.

And this approach will be what we apply to the upcoming auction round, AR7, and beyond, where delivering value for money is our top priority.

We have made reforms to the auction to maximise competition between bidders and reduce the costs to consumers.

And there are multiple pathways and technology mixes that can get us to clean power 2030.

I want to be clear:

We won’t buy at any price and if specific technologies aren’t competitive, we will look elsewhere.

We will take the long-term decisions to secure the right amount of capacity at the right price for the country.

In the coming weeks I will set the initial budget for AR7, working with the Treasury, and we will only go beyond it if it delivers clear value for money.

As we drive towards clean power, we know that many are struggling with their bills now.

And that takes me to the fourth part of my remarks about what we are doing to help families and businesses.

This winter we are expanding the Warm Home Discount to give nearly three million more families on the lowest incomes £150 off their energy bills.

We are increasing support for 7,000 energy intensive businesses.

And we will shortly publish our Warm Homes Plan, kicking off Britain’s biggest programme of home upgrades in generations.

Backed by £13.2 billion of public investment to upgrade up to 5 million homes over this parliament.

The Warm Homes Plan will help families with the costs of solar, batteries, heat pumps and insulation to lower bills and tackle fuel poverty.

In this room, we all know the potential this has to bring the benefit of clean electricity to people and lower their bills.

This is something consumers with the means to do so are already taking advantage of.

We want to spread those benefits much more widely so that this is not just a privilege for those who can afford it.

Alongside this, we will reform the system of consumer protection and advice to help families make the choices that work for them and ensure the highest standards of installation.

We also want to go further.

That is why we will ensure new homes are built with solar and clean heating as standard.

A common-sense policy which has been demanded by the public, championed by this industry, and will be delivered with the Future Homes Standard.

And we don’t just want to stop at new homes.

Solar power offers a cheap and quick way for people to generate their own energy and cut their bills by hundreds of pounds a year.

Currently just 1.5 million homes—around 1 in 20—have solar panels installed.

This is a massive opportunity to cut bills using the free resource of the sun.

I am determined to extend this possibility to millions more families and I want to work with you to do it.

So this is our plan: pursuing clean power by 2030 and bringing the benefits to families as quickly as possible to help with the pressures of affordability that so many face.

The final point I want to make is this.

There are two roads opening up for Britain, in a way that hasn’t been true for the last two decades.

One road, a sprint to clean power—a partnership between industry and government.

The other road, doubling down on our exposure to fossil fuels and turning our back not just on the progress in clean energy of the last 15 months but on the partnership of government and business over many decades.

Going down this road would lose:

The good jobs from the best economic opportunity of the 21st century.

The energy security and sovereignty within our reach.

And of course, our efforts on the climate crisis.

Indeed, waving the white flag in the climate fight would mean we were rightly held in infamy by future generations.

Now of course the breakdown of this consensus poses a challenge to our shared agenda.

I am really confident we can persuade people that the road we have chosen is the right one.

Because the country wants a positive vision and hope for the future and you are all in the hope business. I spoke to an apprentice at Sizewell C and he was buzzing about the opportunity and there will be many others.

This country wants hope and optimism.

Because it is in our economic interests as a country.

And because it is the answer to the affordability challenges that families and businesses face.

I feel humbled to be Energy Secretary.

Together I am determined we will make the right decisions in the months and years ahead to show the British people how our shared agenda can deliver for them.",https://www.gov.uk/assets/frontend/govuk-opengraph-image-4196a4d6333cf92aaf720047f56cfd91b3532d7635fc21ebcf0d5897df6b5f77.png,N,,2025-10-15 12:12:01.016484

Investment in advanced battery technologies, autonomous driving systems and smart cabin features is proving more critical than maintaining traditional production centres associated with legacy brand prestige.
Manufacturing systems need the flexibility to incorporate sophisticated features across price ranges whilst maintaining cost discipline.
The survey suggests that success requires production systems built for rapid technology iteration, dual-powertrain flexibility and feature democratisation across price segments.","China's automotive market is sending a clear signal to global manufacturers: the old playbook no longer works. A comprehensive survey of 2,498 Chinese consumers, conducted by McKinsey between the fourth quarter of 2024 and first quarter of 2025, reveals fundamental shifts in buyer preferences that carry profound implications for production strategies worldwide.

The findings challenge several assumptions that have guided manufacturing investment decisions. Most significantly, the relentless price competition that has dominated headlines is delivering diminishing returns. Despite discount rates in the internal combustion engine (ICE) market rising by nearly eight percentage points in 2024 compared with 2023, and electric vehicle (EV) discounts increasing by nearly five percentage points, the net stimulus effect on consumer demand grew by a mere 0.6 percentage points, from 3.0 percent to 3.6 percent.

Innovation outpaces discounting

By contrast, consumers responded far more enthusiastically to accelerated product development cycles. The survey found that shortened release cycles for new models and technologies generated a net stimulus effect of 10.8 percent, three times higher than price competition. This gap widens further among higher-income consumers, where the innovation stimulus reaches 22.9 percent.

For manufacturing operations, this suggests that flexible production systems capable of rapid model changeovers and technology integration will deliver better returns than capacity dedicated to cost reduction alone. The ability to bring new features to market quickly is becoming a more valuable manufacturing capability than the ability to produce cheaply.

Stellantis stakes $13bn on US manufacturing renaissance

The transatlantic carmaker's largest-ever domestic commitment signals a decisive pivot towards US production, promising five new vehicles and 5,000 jobs as it pursues a 50% capacity expansion across the industrial Midwest.

The brand landscape is undergoing equally dramatic transformation. Twenty new brands have emerged since 2021, each achieving monthly sales exceeding 1,000 units, whilst nine incumbent brands have exited. Yet the average number of brands in consumers' initial consideration sets has grown only modestly, from 2.5 in 2021 to 3.4 in 2024. This creates a winner-takes-most dynamic where manufacturing capacity must either align with emerging leaders or risk underutilisation.

Heritage versus technology

Traditional premium German brands maintain strong luxury recognition, scoring between 4.5 and 4.8 on a five-point scale. However, this perception advantage is failing to translate into EV sales. When asked about EV brands specifically, Chinese manufacturers dominate consumer awareness. Premium German brands that once led consideration sets in the overall market show markedly weaker performance in the EV segment.

The survey identifies why: Chinese consumers now rank brand heritage as only marginally more important than objective factors such as safety and manoeuvrability when defining premium brands. The heritage advantage stands at just four percentage points over safety considerations. More tellingly, among high-income consumers and residents of tier-one cities, brand heritage carries even less weight.

This shift has direct manufacturing implications. Investment in advanced battery technologies, autonomous driving systems and smart cabin features is proving more critical than maintaining traditional production centres associated with legacy brand prestige. Chinese manufacturers account for eight of the top ten brands in autonomous driving perception, nine of ten in advanced electric powertrain technology, and eight of ten in smart cockpit capabilities.

The plug-in hybrid surprise

Perhaps the most unexpected finding concerns powertrain preferences. Whilst global attention has focused on battery electric vehicle (BEV) adoption, the survey reveals growing appeal for plug-in hybrid and extended-range EVs. The regret rate among pure BEV owners who purchased more than three years ago has risen to 32 percent in 2024 from 22 percent in 2023. Even recent BEV buyers show a 13 percent regret rate.

Europe’s carmakers cut production as overcapacity bites

Stellantis, Volkswagen, and Ford are pausing production at multiple plants across Europe amid falling demand, rising inventories, and shrinking market share. With utilisation rates dropping, industry-wide plant closures are beginning to look inevitable.

By contrast, plug-in hybrid and extended-range vehicle owners maintain regret rates around 10 percent regardless of ownership duration. The primary driver is charging infrastructure: China's vehicle-to-charging-pile ratio deteriorated from 7.1:1 in 2023 to 8.4:1 in 2024, whilst the ratio of new vehicles to new charging piles jumped from 7.8:1 to 12.6:1.

Manufacturing operations must adapt accordingly. The survey found that 81 percent of potential EV buyers in 2024 included plug-in hybrids or extended-range vehicles in their consideration sets, up from 71 percent in 2023. This dual-powertrain approach requires different production capabilities than pure BEV manufacturing, particularly in managing complexity across battery, motor and ICE systems.

Notably, plug-in hybrid and extended-range vehicle owners use pure-electric mode for approximately 50 percent of their driving, far exceeding the roughly 20 percent that electric-only range represents of total vehicle range. Nearly half of owners report preferring charging to refuelling, with only 2 percent never charging. This behaviour pattern validates the technology's environmental credentials whilst accommodating infrastructure limitations.

Technology democratisation reshapes differentiation

The survey reveals surging consumer awareness of autonomous driving features, with exposure increasing substantially between 2023 and 2024. Users of city-based navigation-on-autopilot features grew from 23 percent to 45 percent of those with autonomous driving experience. Satisfaction rates improved across all feature levels, and the proportion wanting upgrades to more sophisticated systems increased.

This democratisation of advanced features creates new manufacturing challenges. Long electric range, fast charging capability and autonomous driving are now considered indispensable even among price-conscious buyers of vehicles costing between 100,000 and 150,000 renminbi (between $13,800 and $20,700). Traditional differentiators such as air suspension and rear-wheel steering gain importance only at higher price points.

Driving quality forward: Why digitalisation is transforming automotive manufacturing

In this AMS webinar, we’ll explore how digitalisation and automation are redefining quality in automotive manufacturing — from digital measurement to embedding quality directly into production lines.

For production planning, this implies that advanced technology integration must extend deep into volume segments rather than remaining exclusive to premium lines. Manufacturing systems need the flexibility to incorporate sophisticated features across price ranges whilst maintaining cost discipline.

The implications extend beyond China. As the world's largest automotive market and increasingly its innovation laboratory, Chinese consumer preferences are likely to influence global demand patterns. Manufacturing footprints optimised for yesterday's priorities risk obsolescence as these preferences spread. The survey suggests that success requires production systems built for rapid technology iteration, dual-powertrain flexibility and feature democratisation across price segments. Those capabilities matter more than traditional economies of scale or brand heritage.",https://image.automotivemanufacturingsolutions.com/1589113.jpg?imageId=1589113&x=0&y=0&cropw=100&croph=100&panox=0&panoy=0&panow=100&panoh=100&width=1200&height=683,N,,2025-10-15 12:12:32.870991

But now, STX will formally match the MBTA’s methane fuel consumption with specific RINs.
While methane-fueled buses produce fewer tailpipe emissions than a diesel bus, methane still generates carbon dioxide when it's burned, and the methane drilling and pipeline system itself is a major source of planet-heating pollution.
An MBTA spokesperson told StreetsblogMASS that the overhaul project is currently underway.
The MBTA spokesperson also told StreetsblogMASS that the agency currently does not have plans to reduce its use of methane fuels over the next 5 years.","Last month, the MBTA announced a new partnership that would let the agency participate in a federal biofuel incentive program – but in a way that won't change its bus fleet or the kinds of fuel it consumes.

The T plans to partner with the STX Group, a commodities trading firm, to participate in the Federal Renewable Fuel Standard (RFSII) program.

That program, established in 2005 during George W. Bush's presidency, requires fuel refiners and importers to produce a certain volume of ""renewable"" fuels that aren't drilled out of the ground.

The Environmental Protection Agency tracks compliance with tradable credits called “Renewable Identification Numbers,” or RINs, that represent a certain volume of renewable fuel production. Companies that produce biofuel can sell their RINs to fossil fuel companies to help them meet their quotas.

Critically, an RIN can only fulfill those quotas after the credit has been ""retired,"" or used. That's where the MBTA comes in.

The MBTA's methane-fueled buses consume 200 billion BTUs of energy each year, which is roughly 200 million cubic feet of gas (editor's note: The fossil fuel industry markets methane gas as ""natural"" gas – a term that can mislead the public into believing that the fuel is clean or environmentally benign. StreetsblogMASS refers to the fuel by its primary chemical component and source of energy, which is methane).

Most of that methane is fracked from underground wells. However, a small portion is ""biogas"" that's captured from decomposing organic matter in landfills, sewage treatment plants, and farms. When that happens, the biogas generates an RIN, and the recovered methane often gets injected into the national network of gas distribution pipelines, where it's mixed with fossil methane and delivered to customers like the T.

An MBTA spokesperson explained that the MBTA will continue to use the same fuel as before, with the same methane-fueled buses. The contract with STX will not change anything about the price the T pays for that fuel, or how it's delivered.

But now, STX will formally match the MBTA’s methane fuel consumption with specific RINs.

""This transaction structure allows the MBTA to participate in the RIN marketplace without any operational changes to its existing bus fleet or exposure to future price volatility in the RIN marketplace,"" an MBTA spokesperson explained.

The agency expects to receive $800,000 per year from STX over the course of its 5-year contract.

To put that in context, in fiscal year 2025, the T spent approximately $2 million on methane fuels, a spokesperson told StreetsblogMASS.

Electric buses on pause

The new contract is part of a pause for the MBTA's wider decarbonization strategy.

While methane-fueled buses produce fewer tailpipe emissions than a diesel bus, methane still generates carbon dioxide when it's burned, and the methane drilling and pipeline system itself is a major source of planet-heating pollution.

The state's climate laws require the MBTA to procure only zero-emission buses starting in 2031, and to operate only zero-emission buses after December 31, 2040.

The MBTA currently operates about 175 methane-fueled buses that were manufactured in 2016 and 2017.

120 of those buses are based out of the agency's Arborway bus depot in Jamaica Plain, and 55 are based at Cabot Yard in South Boston (pictured at the top of this article), according to the NETransit vehicle roster.

Until recently, the T had been planning to phase out most of those vehicles by the end of the decade, and had been designing a new maintenance garage designed for a new fleet of zero-emission electric buses at its Arborway bus depot.

But the Massachusetts Legislature and Governor Maura Healey haven't put up any of the necessary funding to implement the MBTA's electric bus plans. This spring, the T removed the Arborway garage construction project from its 5-year capital plan, citing a lack of funding.

Meanwhile, the new capital budget added a new $54 million project to overhaul all 175 methane-fueled buses in the MBTA fleet – a project that would keep the vehicles in service well into the new decade.

An MBTA spokesperson told StreetsblogMASS that the overhaul project is currently underway.

The MBTA spokesperson also told StreetsblogMASS that the agency currently does not have plans to reduce its use of methane fuels over the next 5 years.",https://lede-admin.mass.streetsblog.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/49/2025/10/CNG-fuelling-at-MBTA-Cabot-Garage-10.10.2025.jpg,N,,2025-10-15 10:03:37.272456

But Amy Mooney, Founder of Mutha Cuva, is turning that assumption on its head.
The funding will enable Mutha Cuva to onboard its first 1,000 homes, build a brilliant small team, and scale the platform to launch nationally.
Lead Investor, Advisor and Non-Executive Director, Simon Moyle, said: “Mutha Cuva will become a pioneer showing the way forward.
“There is also something very powerful about building this from the North East.","For years, many founders have believed that raising equity in the North East is next to impossible – particularly for women and those in emerging sectors like climate tech. But Amy Mooney, Founder of Mutha Cuva, is turning that assumption on its head.

From sceptic to champion

Amy is no stranger to building businesses. She co-founded, scaled, and sold a digital agency before investing in and growing a renewable heating company. But when it came to launching her third venture – a subscription-based heat pump servicing platform – she faced a new challenge: raising equity investment for the first time.

Amy explains: “I didn’t know anything about equity and angel investment, and thought it wasn’t for me. I’d always bootstrapped and reinvested profits. Everyone told me raising in the North East would be impossible, especially as a female founder in climate tech, so I went to London for my first investor.”

It was through conversations with James Robson MBE that Amy was introduced to the Pathways to Funding programme and Northern Investor Hub, delivered by Innovation SuperNetwork and powered by UMi. That introduction, she says, changed everything.

The right support at the right time

The programme provided expert input from advisors like Andrew Hodgson, who helped sense-check Amy’s business plan, pitch deck, and financial model, adding the crucial investor lens. Amy was also invited to pitch at a Womble Bond Dickinson event, where she connected with investor Victoria Taylor, who went on to introduce her to further networks.

Behind the scenes, UMi’s financial experts helped extend Amy’s forecasts, building an integrated five-year model covering P&L, balance sheet, and cashflow. And when complex negotiations came up, she had a team she could turn to for advice and confidence.

“I felt I wasn’t alone. As a solo founder new to raising, that made all the difference. The support has been incredible, and it’s helped me secure the majority of my investment here in the North East – something I never thought possible.”

Fuel for growth – and the region’s future

Amy has now closed her £250,000 SEIS pre-seed round, with most investors coming from the region. The funding will enable Mutha Cuva to onboard its first 1,000 homes, build a brilliant small team, and scale the platform to launch nationally. More broadly, she says, it will contribute to reduced carbon emissions, supporting the UK’s transition to net zero and demonstrating the North East’s potential to lead the clean growth economy.

Lead Investor, Advisor and Non-Executive Director, Simon Moyle, said:

“Mutha Cuva will become a pioneer showing the way forward. It is exactly the kind of tech-enabled business, rooted in customer need and delivering tangible outcomes, that I believe has the potential to scale rapidly and make a lasting impact.

“There is also something very powerful about building this from the North East. The region has an incredible tradition of engineering, innovation and resilience, and Mutha Cuva is showing that climate tech start-ups don’t need to be based in London to attract investment or talent. That is one of the reasons I was so keen to get involved.”

Investor Victoria Taylor, CEO of Probe Industries, said:“Mutha Cuva is exactly the kind of innovative, high-potential business we want to see thriving in the North East. Amy’s vision, combined with her deep sector knowledge and execution skills, made investing in her business an obvious choice. Her success demonstrates that the North East has a strong community of investors ready to back ambitious founders, and that this region is a place where equity funding can succeed.”

Looking back, Amy reflects on how far her perspective has shifted:

“If I hadn’t been introduced to Pathways to Funding and the Northern Investor Hub, I’d never have thought raising in the North East was worth my time. Now, I know it absolutely is, and I’m proud to say the majority of our backers are from right here.”

As Mutha Cuva gears up to scale, Amy’s story shows what’s possible when the right support, networks, and ambition come together – not only for one founder, but for the future of investment across the region.

“Amy’s success demonstrates perfectly why the Pathways to Funding programme exists,” said Karl Murray, Specialist Adviser at UMi. “Her raise shows there is strong appetite among investors to back North East businesses, and the Northern Investor Hub is here to help connect ambitious founders with these active investors.”

Phil Witcherley, Director of Economic Growth and Regeneration North East Combined Authority, said:

“Amy’s success with Mutha Cuva reflects the ambition, innovation and talent we’re proud to see across the North East. It also shows the strength of our region’s investment ecosystem, which is creating real opportunities for businesses to scale and thrive here. We want the North East to be the home of the green energy revolution, and we’re committed to supporting entrepreneurs like Amy who are driving clean energy, creating jobs and making a positive difference to communities.”

State investigations into EPIC City

The backstory:

EPIC City has drawn the attention of Governor Greg Abbott, Attorney General Ken Paxton and other Texas leaders.

The developers and East Plano Islamic Center have also been targeted by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, who sent a letter to CCP about the permits required to create a municipal utility district.

Gov. Greg Abbott has also asked the Texas Rangers to investigate the mosque and related businesses.

In a post about EPIC City on social media, Abbott commented, ""Sharia law is not allowed in Texas.""

The mosque was also sent a letter from the Texas Funeral Service Commission and has drawn the attention of the Texas Workforce Commission.

Related

Paxton opened an investigation into communications between EPIC and city officials in Plano, Richardson and Wylie. His office is also looking into CCP.

Dept. of Justice investigation

Sen. John Cornyn requested a DOJ investigation into EPIC City in April, bringing up concerns that the community could discriminate based on faith.

Cornyn sent the letter to Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon, the assistant attorney general for civil rights, asking the agency to look into possible discrimination against other religious groups.

The investigation was dropped in June.

In a letter to Community Capital Partners, Dhillon said the department was closing its investigation.

""CCP has affirmed that all will be welcome in any future development, and that you plan to revise and develop marketing materials to reinforce that message consistent with your obligations under the Fair Housing Act,"" Dhillon said in the June 13 letter. ""Based on this information, the Department is closing its investigation at this time.""

What is EPIC City?

EPIC City is a planned development near Josephine, Texas, about 40 miles northeast of Dallas.

The East Plano Islamic Center, or EPIC, is the organization behind the proposed development.

EPIC’s for-profit company, Community Capital Partners, purchased the 402 acres with the goal of building a mosque, along with 1,000 homes, townhomes, and apartments.

The development sold out its first phase of development, around 500 lots, within six months. Developers are still accepting investors for the second phase of the development.

This can result in a company’s effective tax rate for regular tax being reduced below 15%, which correspondingly can result in a CAMT liability.
Foreign tax credits: Navigating new boundaries CAMT includes a foreign tax credit mechanism, allowing corporations to offset CAMT liability with eligible foreign income taxes.
Modeling these scenarios is essential, as the chosen election may have long-term impacts for both CAMT and regular tax liability.
As used in this document, “Deloitte” means Deloitte Tax LLP, and Deloitte Consulting LLP, which are separate subsidiaries of Deloitte LLP.","CAMT: A new chapter in corporate tax

Enacted in 2022 as part of the Inflation Reduction Act, CAMT imposes a 15% minimum tax on adjusted financial statement income (AFSI)—a measure based on financial statement income, with certain adjustments. This means that even if a company’s regular taxable liability is low, the company may still face a significant tax bill if it is subject to the CAMT (i.e., the company is an applicable corporation) and its AFSI remains high.

Prior to CAMT, deductions could result in substantial tax savings for a company. However, if those deductions do not also reduce AFSI, the company could unexpectedly cross into CAMT liability. While a credit for CAMT paid is available against regular tax liability, some companies could be perpetual CAMT taxpayers. Additionally, the use of CAMT credits is subject to various limitations (especially if the company has significant general business credits). This shift has had an impact on tax planning considerations, and companies may need to rethink or adapt their approach.

OBBBA: Flexibility and complexity

OBBBA provided certain expensing benefits and extended certain provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) that should result in cash-tax savings. However, these benefits may also result in complexity and potentially unintended consequences, inadvertently subjecting some to CAMT, thereby decreasing cash-tax savings. The main provisions of OBBBA that interact with CAMT include:

Section 174 (R&E Expenditures): OBBBA allows corporations to choose between immediately expensing domestic research and experimental (R&E) costs or capitalizing and amortizing them over time. This flexibility is a change from the previous mandatory capitalization rules since R&E costs generally are immediately expensed for book purposes. Transition rules also permit deduction of unamortized balances from prior years over one or two years, which could create a significant book-tax difference and result in a CAMT liability. While a company could elect to capitalize R&E costs to mitigate this difference, this may not align with a company’s objectives.

Section 163(j) (Interest Limitation): OBBBA changes the calculation of adjusted taxable income (ATI) by excluding depreciation and amortization. This allows companies to deduct more interest, which can reduce regular taxable income. However, there would not be a corresponding reduction in AFSI, which could make CAMT liability more likely.

FDII: OBBBA also significantly impacts foreign-derived intangible income (FDII), which is renamed foreign-derived deduction-eligible income (FDDEI), and is subject to a 14% tax rate. OBBBA allocates R&E costs and interest deductions away from FDDEI to income that is subject to a 21% tax rate. This can result in a company’s effective tax rate for regular tax being reduced below 15%, which correspondingly can result in a CAMT liability.

These changes mean that tax teams should not only understand the new rules but also anticipate how different choices may affect both regular tax and CAMT over time. Tax teams may need to undertake modeling exercises to gain a better understanding of the impact of the changes made by the OBBBA.

Foreign tax credits: Navigating new boundaries

CAMT includes a foreign tax credit mechanism, allowing corporations to offset CAMT liability with eligible foreign income taxes. The rules are nuanced:

US-level taxes: Income taxes paid by a US consolidated group are generally fully creditable against CAMT.

CFC-level taxes: Taxes paid by controlled foreign corporations (CFCs) are subject to a limitation—only up to 15% of the CFC’s AFSI can be credited, with excess taxes carried forward for up to five years.

Understanding the distinction between US and CFC-level taxes is critical for managing CAMT exposure, especially for multinational corporations. Ongoing statutory interpretation and proposed regulations may further influence how these credits are applied.

Partnerships: Complexity and relief

For corporations that own interests in partnerships, the CAMT rules are especially complex. However, recent IRS guidance, Notice 2025-28, has provided new elections and methods for calculating AFSI from a partnership investment under CAMT. These options aim to reduce compliance burdens but provide additional considerations with respect to tax planning. Under the statute, there are two partnership adjustments. These are the distributive share adjustments and transactions between partners and the partnership. The Notice provides several different elections for partners and the partnership in determining the two partnership adjustments. Careful analysis is a requirement to understand the impact, both retroactively and prospectively, on adopting these elections.

Modeling these scenarios is essential, as the chosen election may have long-term impacts for both CAMT and regular tax liability.

Modeling and accounting: The path forward

As the rules have evolved, one lesson stands out: Robust modeling is essential. Tax teams may want to consider simulating various scenarios to understand how OBBBA provisions and CAMT interact. This is especially relevant for:

FDDEI and other permanent differences: Favorable rules may push some corporations into perpetual CAMT liability.

General business credits (GBCs): The ordering rules for using CAMT credits can limit their usability, sometimes requiring a valuation allowance.

ASC 740 (Deferred Tax Assets): A corporation that expects to perpetually pay CAMT should analyze, in the period that includes the enactment date, whether to assess the realizability of its deferred tax assets on the basis of all available information or, alternatively, only assess the realizability of its deferred tax assets on the basis of the regular tax system.

Analyzing whether a corporation will be a perpetual CAMT taxpayer requires careful consideration and may have an impact on financial statement presentation and tax planning.

As the tax environment continues to evolve, staying informed and proactive is key. Recently released Notices 2025-46 and 2025-49 from the Treasury and the IRS represent significant steps in the ongoing evolution of the CAMT. Consult with your tax adviser, model your options, and monitor for additional guidance to navigate CAMT and OBBBA with confidence. The story of CAMT is still unfolding, and those who stay ahead of the curve may be positioned to manage risk and identify potential opportunities.

We have been tracking the administration’s actions since February, and our Executive Action Tracker (jointly maintained by the Center for Progressive Reform and Governing for Impact) highlights the speed and effectiveness with which the administration has advanced Project 2025’s goals.

According to our latest analysis, the Trump administration managed to initiate or fulfill more than 47 percent of the Project 2025 domestic regulatory agenda before the current government shutdown. This represents a substantial increase in the administration’s progress since April, when we found that 28 percent of the agenda had been completed.

In all, 251 of the 532 recommended actions identified in the tracker have been fully or partially completed, with the vast majority of them being actions that directly match the letter of Project 2025. The image below shows these numbers, depicting actions that have been initiated or completed (both direct and indirect) and pending actions.

To get a better sense of how these actions are distributed, we grouped them by agency (the 20 agencies within the executive branch explicitly called out in Project 2025) and divided them into direct, indirect, and pending. Direct actions are those that were initiated or completed by the agency listed as the responsible in Project 2025, and indirect actions are those that achieve the same policy goal but that were implemented by other agencies or Congress.

A clear example of an indirect action is the rollback of Resource Management Plans, crafted by the Bureau of Land Management, which is being achieved using Congressional Review Act resolutions. Despite not being rescinded by BLM, like Project 2025 asked for, the ultimate goal is still being fulfilled.

Similarly, Project 2025 called for restoring the Department of Transportation’s primacy on setting auto fuel efficiency, which is technically being pursued by having the Environmental Protection Agency abandon greenhouse emission standards altogether. This case also shows that, in some cases, the administration has gone beyond even Project 2025’s already extreme recommendations.

Moreover, it’s clear that many of the Trump administration’s signature actions arguably fit the spirit of Project 2025 — centralizing power within the White House or weakening civil rights for marginalized populations — though they were not explicitly called for in the plan. The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) seizure of agency information systems and the attacks on universities would fall into this category, for example.

The Detroit News

(TNS)

General Motors Co. on Tuesday reported that it sunk roughly $1.6 billion into electric vehicle manufacturing capacity that it no longer is using because of shifting federal auto policies under President Donald Trump.

GM reported the loss to the Securities and Exchange Commission as what’s known as an impairment charge. Impairment charges reflect assets that are not expected to bring in profits as initially expected.

GM “made significant investments and contractual commitments in the development of electric vehicles (EVs) to help the Company’s vehicle fleet comply with emissions and fuel economy regulations that were scheduled to become increasingly stringent,” according to a company filing.

“Following recent U.S. Government policy changes, including the termination of certain consumer tax incentives for EV purchases and the reduction in the stringency of emissions regulations, we expect the adoption rate of EVs to slow,” according to GM’s filing. “These developments have caused us to reassess our EV capacity and manufacturing footprint.”

GM executives have continued to call electrification the company’s “North Star.” But, along with other EV makers, the company has been shaken this year by Republicans’ removal of a $7,500 tax credit for EV buyers and lessees, as well as Trump’s efforts to pull back federal rules limiting vehicle greenhouse gas emissions.

GM more than doubled its electric vehicle sales in the third quarter compared with the same period a year ago, largely due to drivers hoping to take advantage of the tax credits before they expired Sept. 30. Analysts predict a steep drop-off in EV sales in the coming months.

Interest in EVs among U.S. drivers, while increasing, is also doing so at a far slower pace than many in the industry expected.

The bulk of GM’s impairment charge—$1.2 billion—represents machinery and other equipment to make EVs that is now sitting unused. The other $400 million is mostly from canceled contracts with suppliers to provide GM with more parts, materials and equipment than it now can use.

The life sciences and healthcare sector is an inherently collaborative and creative industry, and those traits remain crucial to countering the difficult funding market that continues through 2025. Uncertainty over tariffs, interest rates, prescription drug pricing and geopolitical conflicts is injecting volatility into valuations and access to capital. These macro variables continue to influence deal timing, structure and pricing, and they have extended diligence cycles. Yet the message from the conference was not one of retrenchment. Fundraising is occurring, innovation remains vibrant, and well-matched partners are finding ways to transact. Investors were encouraged to be bolder about exchanging ideas, form syndicates around promising platforms and bring conviction to earlier stage opportunities. For smaller biotechs, cultivating relationships with large pharma and embedding strategic partnerships into the financing plan were recurring themes.

Partnerships as capital efficiency

In a capital constrained environment, partnership is not merely optional—it is a capital efficiency strategy. Companies are using divestitures to sharpen focus, co developing to share cost and risk, and licensing by indication or territory to advance assets while conserving resources and leveraging external expertise. These structures enable companies to keep programs moving without overextending balance sheets, while buyers gain optionality through phased economics and rights tailored to their strategic needs.

The supply demand imbalance for de risked assets

There is more demand for de risked assets than supply. Buyers seeking either proven, non novel products or innovative assets with established data often confront competitive processes and premium pricing. As a result, many are looking earlier in the development continuum. Later stage deals face added friction from supply chain uncertainty and higher manufacturing costs, while earlier stage transactions shift more R&D investment to the buyer and therefore tend to feature lower upfront valuations, tranched funding, and milestone heavy economics. This is pushing dealmakers to craft structures that balance risk sharing with sufficient incentives to keep programs on track.

The patent cliff as a catalyst for M&A

Throughout the conference, speakers highlighted the looming patent cliff that will affect a significant number of high revenue products over the next five years. Large pharma executives noted that planning for loss of exclusivity is a constant feature of portfolio management, but the magnitude of expirations ahead raises the stakes. The consensus was clear: internal R&D alone cannot close the gap. Expect a steady pickup in M&A and late stage partnering as companies look to fill anticipated revenue holes, diversify therapeutic exposure and secure platform technologies that can generate multiple shots on goal.

AI: acceleration and disruption

Artificial intelligence is accelerating drug discovery, trial design and data analysis, while simultaneously reshaping capital flows. Where capital is available, AI centric companies are capturing a meaningful share, heightening competition for funding across the broader life sciences ecosystem. Diagnostics companies are among those deploying AI in particularly promising ways, but the quality of outputs depends on the quality of inputs. Historical limitations in data collection—such as the underrepresentation of women in certain clinical trials—can propagate bias into models. A pragmatic approach discussed at the conference was to partner with “tech tech”: let technology firms focus on building and refining models, while pharma and biotech provide the proprietary domain data and governance required to train those models responsibly and effectively. This division of labor can accelerate timelines while mitigating risk.

What this means for M&A in 2025

Taken together, these dynamics point to an M&A market that is selective but active. Strategic acquirers are sharpening their theses around core therapeutic areas and platform capabilities. Boards are insisting on disciplined capital allocation, which favors structured deals, earn outs and option based collaborations. Sellers who can articulate clear value inflection points, present clean data packages and offer rights that align with buyer strategy are best positioned. Meanwhile, the patent cliff and the maturation of AI enabled discovery are likely to sustain deal flow as buyers seek both near term revenue and long term growth engines.",https://edge.sitecorecloud.io/allenoveryllp1-aoshearmanwe0db-production-ecf3/media/project/aoshearman/aoshearman/blogs/images/on-life-sciences/digital-dna-gettyimages684137700.jpg?h=1063&iar=0&w=1600,N,,2025-10-15 12:12:16.968948

The Global Carbon Fiber Market size is expected to be worth around USD 9.2 Billion by 2034, from USD 4.4 Billion in 2024, growing at a CAGR of 7.7% during the forecast period from 2025 to 2034.

Carbon fiber (CF) is a high-performance material made from precursor fibers (most commonly polyacrylonitrile, or PAN) which are converted by stabilization, carbonization, and graphitization processes. It offers exceptional strength-to-weight ratio, stiffness, corrosion resistance, and thermal stability. These attributes make carbon fiber a preferred material in demanding applications such as aerospace, wind turbine blades, high-end automotive, pressure vessels, sports equipment, and advanced infrastructure components.

The growth of this industry is underpinned by several strong driving factors. First, the global push toward decarbonization and energy transition stimulates demand in clean-energy infrastructure—especially wind and hydrogen sectors—where carbon fiber’s lightweight, high-strength traits enable longer blades and lighter pressure vessels. For example, in hydrogen storage applications, carbon fiber currently accounts for about 50% of the cost of the storage tank system; research efforts are targeting carbon fiber production costs below USD 15/kg to accelerate adoption.

From a policy and government initiative vantage, several jurisdictions are encouraging carbon fiber deployment or manufacturing. In the United States, agencies such as the DOE have explored policy instruments to support carbon fiber manufacturing via R&D funding, economic development incentives, and clustering strategies.

For instance, the DOE’s Bioenergy Technologies Office announced a USD 12 million funding opportunity to develop renewable carbon fiber from biomass feedstocks. Government incentive frameworks frequently include tax credits, grants, or infrastructure support to promote advanced materials manufacturing, especially when aligned with clean energy goals. In the trade domain, recent U.S. tariff adjustments increased duties on imported carbon fiber tow to 25% effective March 2025, which may encourage domestic production substitution.

Rise of Circular & Recyclable Carbon Fiber Composites

Carbon fiber composites today often result in significant scrap or waste during manufacturing: up to 40 % of carbon fiber (or CFRP) material is reportedly sent to landfill during fabrication or trimming steps. That’s not trivial — imagine almost half of the “super material” ending up unused or tossed. To counter this, researchers and manufacturers are pushing for “zero-waste” manufacturing methods or ways to reclaim fibers effectively.

Particularly promising is the work from the U.S. National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). Their team has developed carbon fiber composites made with bio-derivable resin (a greener kind of polymer) that can be recycled at least three times using a mild depolymerization process. This means a part made of carbon fiber composite might live through three life cycles instead of ending in waste after one use. If scaled and commercialized, this would drastically lower the effective cost and environmental burden of carbon fiber parts.

Another indicator of the trend’s strength is the technological maturity of recycling research. A study tracking research output and development maturity estimated that in 2018, the maturity of carbon fiber composite recycling was around 10%, but projections expect it to hit 50% by 2028, and almost 90% by 2038.

Governments and research bodies are paying attention too. Many countries now include “recyclable materials” or “circular economy” as part of their roadmap or industrial policy. For instance, clean manufacturing and extended producer responsibility (EPR) policies often require producers to think of end-of-life management. Though I didn’t find a carbon-fiber-specific national policy in this latest scan, these broader policies push composite manufacturers to adopt recyclable strategies.

Drivers

Light-weighting to Improve Energy Efficiency in Transportation

One of the most powerful forces steering the growth of carbon fiber is the urgent need to make vehicles lighter so they consume less fuel or electricity. In simple terms: lighter vehicles mean less energy used. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, cutting vehicle weight by just 10% can boost fuel efficiency by 6–8 %. That relationship makes carbon fiber — which offers very high strength for low weight — highly attractive for automakers who must meet tighter emissions and efficiency rules.

In many countries, governments are pushing for stricter standards on fuel economy and carbon emissions. For example, regulatory bodies may require auto manufacturers to reduce fleet average emissions in grams of CO₂ per kilometer. That puts pressure on car companies to look for advanced materials. Replace parts made of steel or aluminum with carbon fiber composites, and you can shave off handfuls of kilos across the body, chassis, or internal components — and those kilos saved translate into real energy and emissions benefits over millions of vehicles.

Governments are also actively supporting research and policies to make lightweight materials more affordable and to encourage their adoption. In the U.S., for instance, Department of Energy (DOE) programs aim to develop lower-cost carbon fiber processes so that this “super material” becomes viable for more regular cars (not just premium models). Public funding, tax incentives, or matching grants for manufacturing modernization are typical levers used in many countries (though the details differ). This kind of support helps offset the high cost of carbon fiber production and encourages industry to scale innovations.

Restraints

High Energy & Environmental Cost of Production

One of the biggest brakes slowing down carbon fiber’s wider adoption is how energy-hungry and carbon-intensive its production can be. That’s more than a technical issue — it touches economics, environment, and public perception.

To start with, producing carbon fiber demands vast amounts of energy. Studies show that making 1 kg of carbon fiber typically consumes between 50 and 80 kWh of energy in conventional routes. In more intensive cases or less optimized processes, the energy use can vary even more widely — from 2.1 to 132.8 kWh per kg in some literature estimates. On the climate side, this high energy use translates into heavy greenhouse gas emissions: many evaluations put the carbon footprint of virgin carbon fiber production in the range of 13 to 34 kg CO₂ per kg of fiber.

This energy and emissions burden is not just a “nice to avoid” — it becomes a competitive liability. In applications that are very sensitive to life-cycle emissions, or where consumers or regulators demand low-carbon materials (for instance, in transportation or green infrastructure), carbon fiber’s footprint can work against it. The higher emissions profile becomes a cost in regulatory compliance, carbon taxes, or environmental disclosures.

Another angle where this restraint bites hard is cost structure. In a detailed cost model for a reasonably large production plant, producing 1 kg of carbon fiber was estimated to cost USD 10.87, where the precursor material alone accounted for ~53.4% of that cost, and energy contributed ~7%. This means that any fluctuation in energy prices or stricter carbon pricing policies can rapidly make carbon fiber less competitive compared to lighter metals or advanced aluminum alloys. Indeed, for new world-scale plants targeting a 10% internal rate of return, industry analysts forecast that costs per kg might need to be around USD 25 under certain energy-intensive assumptions.

Carbon fiber producers often face tension: to lower their carbon footprint or energy demand, they must invest in advanced equipment, cleaner energy sources, or process innovations — all of which require capital and time. For example, the U.S. Department of Energy’s manufacturing programs aim to drive down energy use in carbon fiber production by up to 75% over a decade, relative to baseline processes.

Opportunity

Expansion in Wind Turbine Blades and Renewable Energy

One of the most promising growth opportunities for carbon fiber lies in its application in wind turbine blades, especially as nations push to scale up renewable energy. Wind power is a central part of many countries’ clean energy targets, and carbon fiber offers a way to build longer, lighter, stronger blades — enabling turbines to generate more electricity with each rotation.

In the U.S., the wind energy supply chain report highlights that fiber-reinforced composites — including carbon fiber — compose primary materials used in blades. The report also mentions that demand for carbon fiber for wind turbines could triple by around 2027. This “tripling” is not just hype — it reflects how wind project developers are eyeing carbon fiber to leap past limitations of existing blade technology. As turbines go offshore into harsher environments, the durability, fatigue resistance, and lightweight nature of carbon fiber become more compelling.

Governments increasingly support this shift. Renewable energy mandates, feed-in tariffs, auctions, and subsidies for wind development help drive demand for higher-performance blade materials. Many countries include local content requirements, R&D funding, or tax benefits for innovation in wind tech. For instance, national wind energy agencies often partner with composite material labs or institutes to support novel blade designs that incorporate carbon fiber. These policies de-risk investment in new materials, making carbon fiber more attractive to wind OEMs and blade manufacturers.

Beyond wind, the growth opportunity extends to hybrid energy systems. As more grids integrate solar, storage, and offshore wind, developers demand materials that can handle cyclic loads, corrosion, and material fatigue over decades. Carbon fiber is positioned well in that niche. The global push toward renewable energy is not slowing.

According to the IEA’s Global Energy Review 2025, global energy demand grew 2.2% in 2024, with electricity demand rising 4.3 % — and renewables contributed 38% of that growth in energy supply. This trend means more investments in wind and solar assets — meaning more demand for advanced materials like carbon fiber.

Regional Insights

Europe dominates with 34.70% share amounting to USD 1.5 Billion as regional carbon fiber leader

In 2024, the European carbon fiber market stood at approximately USD 1.5 billion, corresponding to around 34.70% of the global market. This dominant position is rooted in the strong presence of key industries in Europe—automotive, aerospace, renewable energy (notably wind turbines), and high-performance sports equipment—that demand high-quality carbon fiber for lightweighting and performance.

Year 2024 in Europe saw demand rising particularly in automotive sectors where OEMs increase carbon fiber usage for body structures, frames, and internal parts to reduce vehicle weight and meet stricter emission regulations. Similarly, the wind energy sector placed large orders for carbon fiber used in turbine blades as offshore and onshore wind projects proliferated in Northern Europe. Aerospace further contributed significantly, with European aircraft manufacturers (e.g. Airbus) incorporating carbon fiber in fuselage and wing components.

The Evolution of Illinois Green Energy Policy

Key Policy Milestones

Illinois has made significant strides in green energy policy over the past two decades. In 2007, the state launched its first Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS), setting initial clean energy goals. A major breakthrough came in 2016 with the Future Energy Jobs Act (FEJA), which strengthened the RPS and established ambitious solar programs.

The landmark Climate and Equitable Jobs Act (CEJA) of 2021 marked a turning point, committing Illinois to 100% clean energy by 2050. This legislation created the Coal-to-Solar Energy Storage Initiative and expanded the Illinois Solar for All program, making solar energy more accessible to low-income communities.

In 2022, the state introduced additional incentives through the Illinois Shines program, offering renewable energy credits to homeowners and businesses investing in solar installations. The Smart Grid Infrastructure program, implemented in phases since 2011, continues to modernize the power grid to accommodate increasing renewable energy capacity.

Most recently, Illinois launched the Clean Energy Innovation Fund in 2023, providing grants for emerging green technologies and supporting local clean energy businesses.

Current Policy Framework

Illinois currently operates under a comprehensive renewable energy framework that combines state and federal initiatives. The Illinois Clean Energy Jobs Act (CEJA) serves as the cornerstone of state policy, mandating 100% clean energy by 2045 and establishing robust incentives for renewable energy adoption.

Key elements include the Solar Renewable Energy Credit (SREC) program, which provides financial incentives for solar installations, and the Illinois Shines program, offering rebates to homeowners and businesses investing in solar technology. The state also maintains net metering policies, allowing energy producers to receive credits for excess power fed back into the grid.

Federal support complements these state initiatives through the Investment Tax Credit (ITC), which currently offers a 30% tax credit for solar installations. Additional programs include accelerated depreciation benefits for businesses and various grant opportunities through the Department of Energy.

Local municipalities often supplement these frameworks with their own incentives, such as expedited permitting processes and property tax exemptions for renewable energy installations. These multi-layered policies create a supportive environment for green energy adoption across Illinois.

Advocacy Partnerships Driving Change

Successful Coalition Models

Illinois has emerged as a leader in demonstrating how public-private solar partnerships can drive meaningful change in green energy policy. The Illinois Clean Energy Community Foundation’s collaboration with local municipalities has successfully implemented solar projects in over 100 communities, proving that coordinated efforts yield substantial results.

A standout example is the Bloomington-Normal Solar Initiative, where business leaders partnered with environmental groups and local government to create a comprehensive solar adoption program. This partnership resulted in a 300% increase in residential solar installations within its first year, while creating dozens of local green energy jobs.

The Chicago Clean Energy Alliance demonstrates another successful model, bringing together utility companies, community organizations, and policy advocates. Their collaborative approach led to the development of community solar gardens in underserved neighborhoods, making clean energy accessible to residents who previously couldn’t afford solar installations.

These coalitions work because they address multiple stakeholder needs simultaneously. Businesses gain market opportunities, communities receive clean energy benefits and job creation, and policymakers achieve their environmental goals. The key to their success lies in transparent communication, shared goal-setting, and equitable distribution of benefits among all partners.

Small business owners and homeowners can participate in these initiatives through local chambers of commerce or community energy programs, which provide resources and support for green energy adoption.

Green energy partnerships create ripple effects that extend far beyond environmental benefits, directly impacting local communities and economies in Illinois. When municipalities and businesses collaborate on renewable energy initiatives, they often generate new job opportunities in installation, maintenance, and manufacturing sectors. These positions typically offer competitive wages and provide sustainable career paths for local residents.

Communities that embrace green energy policies frequently experience reduced energy costs, which benefits both households and businesses. For example, several Illinois towns have reported significant savings on municipal electricity bills after implementing solar projects, redirecting those funds to essential community services and infrastructure improvements.

These partnerships also strengthen local economic resilience. By diversifying energy sources and creating local power generation, communities become less dependent on external energy markets and their price fluctuations. This stability attracts new businesses and investments, contributing to economic growth and development.

Educational institutions benefit through hands-on learning opportunities and workforce development programs. Many Illinois schools and community colleges have established renewable energy training programs in partnership with local solar companies, preparing students for careers in the growing green energy sector.

Additionally, green energy initiatives often include community solar projects, allowing residents who cannot install their own solar panels to participate in renewable energy programs. This inclusive approach ensures that the benefits of clean energy are accessible to all community members, regardless of home ownership or income level.

Economic Benefits of Green Energy Policies

Illinois offers numerous financial incentives and support programs that make transitioning to renewable energy increasingly attractive. Through various green energy financing options, both homeowners and businesses can significantly reduce their initial investment costs.

The Illinois Solar for All program provides substantial rebates and incentives for low-income households, making solar energy accessible to more communities. Additionally, the federal Investment Tax Credit (ITC) allows property owners to deduct 30% of their solar installation costs from their federal taxes.

Local utilities offer net metering programs, enabling customers to earn credits for excess energy production, effectively reducing energy costs over time. Commercial property owners can also benefit from accelerated depreciation through the Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System (MACRS).

The Smart Inverter Rebate Program provides additional savings for grid-connected solar installations, while Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) financing allows property owners to fund renewable energy improvements through their property tax assessments. These programs, combined with decreasing equipment costs, make green energy investments increasingly cost-effective for Illinois residents and businesses.

Job Creation and Economic Growth

The transition to green energy has emerged as a powerful economic driver in Illinois, creating numerous job opportunities across various sectors. Solar installation teams, wind turbine technicians, and energy efficiency specialists represent just a fraction of the new positions being created. Recent studies indicate that renewable energy projects in Illinois generate approximately three times more jobs per dollar invested compared to fossil fuel initiatives.

General Motors, which had led the way among U.S. automakers with plans to convert production to an electric fleet of vehicles, said in a regulatory filing on Tuesday that it will have to book charges that include non-cash impairment and other charges of $1.2 billion due to EV capacity adjustments. There's also $400 million in charges mostly related to contract cancellation fees and commercial settlements associated with EV-related investments.

GM warned that it may take additional hits as it adjusts production, with non-cash charges potentially impacting operations and cash flow in the future.

The company said that its EV capacity realignment doesn't impact its retail portfolio of Chevrolet, GMC and Cadillac EVs currently in production, and that it expects those models to remain available to consumers.

EVs were considered to be the future of the US automotive industry. GM had announced in 2020 that it was going to invest $27 billion in electric and autonomous vehicles in the next five years, a 35% increase over plans made before the pandemic.

In 2021, GM said that it planned to have more than half of its North American and China factories be capable of making electric vehicles by 2030. It also pledged at the time to increase its investment in EV charging networks by nearly $750 million through 2025.

A year later, GM CEO Mary Barra said that the automaker would sell more electric vehicles in the U.S. than Tesla by the middle of the decade. GM also had a goal of making the vast majority of the vehicles it produces electric by 2035, and the entire company carbon neutral, including operations, five years after that.

Yet U.S. automakers are being hampered in some of their long-term planning, with drastic changes in economic and environmental policy from one administration to the next. The automakers are also facing increased competition from automakers such as China's BYD, which announced in July that its sales grew 31% in the first six months of the year to 2.1 million cars.

BYD’s sales have skyrocketed on the back of a government-driven EV boom in China. The rise of BYD and other Chinese electric vehicle makers is a challenge for Tesla and the world’s other major automakers as Chinese competitors push into Europe, Southeast Asia and other overseas markets with a relatively affordable option for drivers who want to go green.",https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3c6ea46/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5467x2870+0+134/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fewscripps.brightspotcdn.com%2Fbe%2Fbf%2F599634064054a37d5ea4f9df3029%2Fap25287409798899.jpg,N,,2025-10-15 08:59:29.756389

Prime Minister Carney pledges support for Canadian auto workers amid tariff-driven production shift

Stellantis has announced a $13 billion investment over the next four years to expand its U.S. manufacturing operations, a move that will increase domestic production by 50% while raising concerns about the future of Canadian automotive jobs. The investment, described as the largest in the company’s 100-year history, will support five new vehicle launches, 19 product refreshes, and the creation of more than 5,000 jobs at facilities in Illinois, Ohio, Michigan, and Indiana.

The plan includes reopening the Belvidere, Illinois, assembly plant to produce the Jeep Cherokee and Jeep Compass for the U.S. market. According to Radio-Canada, the next-generation Compass, previously assembled in Canada, will now be built at Belvidere starting in 2027. LouAnn Gosselin, Stellantis Canada’s communications director, confirmed the production shift but noted the company will add a third shift at its Windsor, Ontario, assembly plant to meet demand.

“This investment in the U.S. – the single largest in the Company’s history – will drive our growth, strengthen our manufacturing footprint and bring more American jobs to the states we call home,” said Antonio Filosa, Stellantis CEO and North America COO.

Canadian Union and Government Response

Unifor, which represents approximately 320,000 workers across Canada including thousands at Stellantis’ Brampton and Windsor plants, expressed alarm at the announcement. National president Lana Payne stated that Canadian automotive jobs are being sacrificed due to U.S. trade policies and called on governments to demand investment commitments in Brampton.

Prime Minister Mark Carney responded with a pledge to support Canadian auto workers, stating Ottawa will work with the Ontario government and Unifor to protect Stellantis employees and create new opportunities in Brampton and the region. “This decision today is a direct consequence of current U.S. tariffs and potential future trade measures,” Carney said, according to Radio-Canada. The prime minister added that the federal budget, scheduled for November 4, will include investments to build Canada’s economy while ensuring workers can seize new opportunities.

The announcement follows Stellantis’ temporary suspension of its Brampton plant operations in February 2025, shortly after 25% tariffs on Canadian products imported to the U.S. took effect. The company anticipated losing approximately $2.4 billion CAD in tariff costs for 2025.

U.S. Plant Investment Details

The $13 billion allocation covers research and development, supplier costs, and manufacturing investments across multiple facilities:

Illinois (Belvidere): More than $600 million to reopen the plant for Jeep Cherokee and Compass production, creating approximately 3,300 jobs with 2027 launch target

Ohio (Toledo Assembly Complex): Nearly $400 million for an all-new midsize truck alongside Jeep Wrangler and Gladiator production, adding more than 900 jobs with 2028 launch expected

Michigan (Warren Truck Assembly): Nearly $100 million investment for all-new range-extended EV and internal combustion engine large SUV production beginning 2028, adding more than 900 jobs to facility currently building Jeep Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer

Michigan (Detroit Assembly Complex – Jefferson): $130 million to prepare for next-generation Dodge Durango production launching in 2029

Indiana (Kokomo facilities): More than $100 million to produce all-new GMET4 EVO four-cylinder engine starting 2026, adding more than 100 jobs

The Toledo plant investment also includes previously announced January commitments for Jeep Wrangler and Gladiator enhancements and components for the Toledo Machining Plant.

Filosa stated that accelerating U.S. growth has been a top priority, adding that “success in America is not just good for Stellantis in the U.S. — it makes us stronger everywhere.” The company currently operates 34 manufacturing facilities, parts distribution centres, and research locations across 14 U.S. states, supporting more than 48,000 employees, 2,600 dealers, and nearly 2,300 suppliers.

Attendees agreed Italy needs to invest in batteries and the grid as well as renewable energy generation.
He stressed the importance, however, of future-proofing any new Italian energy system, adding, “Italy must build a system that is also redundant, with respect to what the needs are.
“FER X, which is very well designed, stabilizes investment,” said Merli.
Experts then said that, for next year, we should expect two MACSE auctions, one for lithium batteries and one for pumped storage, and at least one Capacity Market auction.","Attendees at the Italian Renewables Investment Forum 2025, held in Rome by Green Horse, predicted the nation will hold two Mercato a termine degli stoccaggi (MACSE) auctions next year: A second lithium-ion battery exercise and another dedicated to pumped hydro. At least one more capacity market auction was also predicted for 2026.

Stefano Granella, CEO of Dolomiti Energia Group, stressed the key role planning will have in the nation’s energy transition and said the MACSE program was a good start, but more is needed. “Batteries are needed, what happened recently is excellent but it is not the panacea,” said Granella.

The chief executive said the low margins of both the MACSE and Fonti Energetiche Rinnovabili (FER) X programs suggest they are tools that make investment feasible but only for companies which can develop projects and processes on an industrial scale.

Attendees at yesterday’s event agreed Italy’s energy prices make the country a more attractive location for investment than Spain, which has ultra-low energy prices; the United States, thanks to political headwinds; and South America, where curtailment of renewable energy occurs in some countries and others entail currency risk. Italy’s attractiveness has been boosted by subsidy policy, according to Green Horse Legal Managing Partner Carlo Montella, who said, “What makes Italy particularly attractive are the regulated remuneration schemes.”

Granella, however, warned the tariffs determined by the MACSE and FER X programs suggest Italy’s energy transition could follow a similar path to Spain’s.

Attendees agreed Italy needs to invest in batteries and the grid as well as renewable energy generation.

Luca Marchisio, head of system strategy at Terna, said Italy will have 200 GW of installed generation capacity by 2030, including 140 GW of clean power facilities. With the nation having had a peak load to date of 60 GW, Marchisio said, “Curtailment will be a structural element of the operation of our system, period.”

Marco Carta, CEO of Agici, said investing in renewables costs money but doing nothing costs much more.

“The overall loss for the national economy would amount to €137 billion ($159 billion) by 2050, equal to over €5 billion a year,” said Carta. “The cost of … doing [would be] €6,000 euros per inhabitant. This is constantly declined at the regional level.”

Carta presented a report indicating renewables investment benefits stand at around €160 billion and not investing in clean energy would mean 342,000 fewer jobs.

CVA Chief Executive Giuseppe Argirò noted a “very fractured and dangerous” geopolitical environment and said the Russian gas shock may prove to be the first of many. He stressed the importance, however, of future-proofing any new Italian energy system, adding, “Italy must build a system that is also redundant, with respect to what the needs are. I am convinced that, in a very few years technology will bring very significant performance at even lower prices. We must aim for a system that is safe, therefore reducing dependency.”

ERG chief executive Paolo Merli highlighted the poor performance of renewables stocks since peaking in January 2021 and said Italian support mechanisms were not doing enough.

“FER X, which is very well designed, stabilizes investment,” said Merli. “But that same FER X plant contributes to bringing plant prices to zero.”

Several attendees spoke about the Iberdrola model and the message from the event was that we are entering a phase in which competition will be significant in auctions.

Experts then said that, for next year, we should expect two MACSE auctions, one for lithium batteries and one for pumped storage, and at least one Capacity Market auction.",https://www.ess-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/green-horse-a.jpg,N,,2025-10-15 11:03:12.715944

Our Next Energy has fired most of its employees and is giving up the lease on its Van Buren Township facility, Automotive News reported in September. ONE did not respond to an email seeking comment. The company has locations in Novi and Belleville.

Gov. Gretchen Whitmer had applauded a state grant to the company in 2022.

“Our Next Energy’s $1.6 billion investment creating 2,112 jobs in Van Buren Township will build on our economic momentum and secure the future of mobility and electrification right here in Michigan,” Whitmer said in a press release. “This innovative, Michigan-made company is on the cutting-edge of battery technology, and the work they’re doing will increase the range of electric vehicles to over 600 miles on a single charge. With this new gigafactory, we will continue bringing the supply chain of electric vehicles, chips, and batteries home to Michigan and the USA while creating a sustainable, clean energy economy. I am proud that Democrats and Republicans in Michigan came together to build up our economic development toolkit and empowered our state to compete for every project and every job. We will work with anyone and compete with everyone to keep putting Michiganders first, creating good-paying jobs with great benefits, and building the future of the auto industry right here in Michigan.”

A Mackinac Center for Public Policy report has found that over 20 years, jobs subsidies failed 91% of the time.

“One company failing to live up to promises is not an aberration, it should be an expectation for lawmakers,” James Hohman, the Mackinac Center’s fiscal policy director, told CapCon in an email. “Major deals fail to create 91% of the jobs lawmakers say will be created. The company has collected $70 million from taxpayers already. State officials should stop making deals where companies get cash prior to hitting their job targets.”

The Michigan Economic Development Corporation continues to review its incentive agreement with Our Next Energy, Danielle Emerson, MEDC public relations manager, told CapCon in an email.

“While the jobs requirement milestone for this project is not due until December 2029, we are being proactive in working with ONE to ensure the agreement reflects any updated scope of the project,” Emerson wrote. “In the meantime, no new disbursements will be made under the current agreement. We are optimistic about the company’s path forward given the potential benefit from the federal One Big Beautiful Bill tying tax credits to domestic content.

1. Rise of renewables

Renewable energy has produced more electricity than coal for the first time, according to a report from energy think tank Ember.

Global electricity demand grew by 2.6% in the first half of 2025 – a rise that was more than met by increases in solar (+31%) and wind generation (+7.7%), the report says. With growth of 306 TWh – about the same amount of electricity that a country like Italy uses in a year – solar alone covered 83% of the increase in demand.

Coal generation, meanwhile, fell by 0.6%, leading to renewables’ share of global electricity rising 1.6 percentage points to 34.3%. Coal’s share fell by just over a percentage point to 33.1%.

Coal use and emissions fell in China and India as wind and solar met the growth in demand, the report adds. But its use grew in other major regions, with the European Union leaning on gas and coal to offset falls in hydro, bioenergy and wind generation and the US using more coal because clean sources did not rise enough to meet demand growth.

Concluding that the surge of solar and wind provides a “pivotal moment” to accelerate the energy transition, the report calls for governments to set ambitious targets and policies to speed up deployment of clean energy sources.

Emerging economies in particular, it says, still face barriers to renewables generation and need support from mature economies to overcome them.

The World Economic Forum's Coal to Clean platform works with energy, finance and civil society organizations to accelerate funding for the early retirement and repurposing of coal-fired power plants in emerging economies

2. Invest in grids and batteries - IEA

Amid the surge in solar, the head of the International Energy Agency (IEA) has highlighted the need to address supply chain and grid challenges.

In an announcement accompanying the agency’s Renewables 2025 report, Fatih Birol said that, driven by low costs and faster timeframes for permits, solar PV is on course to account for about 80% of the increase in the world’s renewable capacity until the end of this decade.

As renewables’ role in power systems increases in many countries, policy-makers “need to pay close attention to supply chain security and grid integration challenges,” he said.

The rapid rise of renewables is putting increasing pressure on electricity systems, the report notes, and with curtailment and negative price events appearing in more markets, it calls for urgent investment in grids, energy storage and flexible generation.

The report lowers its overall renewable energy growth forecast for 2025-2030 by 5% compared to last year to reflect policy, regulatory and market changes.

The report underscores the need to ensure power systems are flexible, resilient and sustainable – these will be the ""backbone of future economies"", according to the World Economic Forum's Future of Power Systems initiative.

The initiative works with a diverse range of stakeholders to drive the partnerships, strategies and innovations that will support future demand.

FREMONT, Calif. and AUSTIN, Texas, Oct. 15, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Nextracker (NASDAQ: NXT), a leading solar technology platform provider, and T1 Energy Inc. (NYSE: TE), an advanced manufacturer of solar modules, today announced a strategic framework agreement to use Nextracker’s patented steel module frame technology for T1 Energy’s new 5-GW G1_Dallas solar manufacturing facility. The agreement is expected to accelerate the industry’s transition away from imported aluminum frames toward made-in-the-USA frames using locally manufactured specialty steel, and support demand in the U.S. for durable solar technology.

“Clearway applauds Nextracker’s technology and manufacturing program to bring next-generation, American-made steel module frames to support the domestic photovoltaics (PV) industry. These new steel frames increase the domestic content of the module, create a stiffer, more reliable module, and with Nextracker's ongoing innovation, will enable faster installation rates compared to legacy aluminum frames,” said Ross Heiman, vice president of engineering at Clearway Energy Group.

“We’re proud to offer our customers leading-edge solar module frame technology from Nextracker,” said Daniel Barcelo, Chairman and CEO, T1 Energy. “These are American companies and factories with American workers delivering American energy security. With potential for surging demand from data centers and AI infrastructure, the U.S. needs to establish critical energy supply chains built on domestic capacity and industrial expertise. This is exactly what T1 and Nextracker are doing, together.”

“Solar panels were invented by Bell Labs in the 1950s, and it is fantastic to see reshoring of PV manufacturing facilities at real scale in the USA,” said Dan Shugar, founder and CEO of Nextracker. “It is a privilege to be supporting T1 Energy’s state-of-the-art manufacturing facility in Dallas with our patented steel module frames using high quality and low carbon U.S.-produced steel. Our technology enables lower cost solar power by improving PV module durability and installation velocity.”

Most solar frames are produced with extruded aluminum and imported from Asia. Through this partnership, Nextracker will reshore critical manufacturing capacity and enable a domestic supply of specialty steel frames that are competitively priced and are expected to be more durable, and less exposed to tariff and global supply chain risks.

To support this initiative, Nextracker plans to increase its existing U.S. steel frame capacity in the Midwest with additional manufacturing lines in Texas, creating high-quality jobs. This would complement Nextracker’s Texas footprint of more than a dozen manufacturing partners that produce key solar tracker components.

The halted Commonwealth facility is one of six LNG export projects proposed, approved or operating along Cameron’s coast. Construction of the pipelines, storage tanks and shipping facilities that make up the facility would dig up or fill nearly 200 acres of wetlands and water bottoms, according to the project’s coastal use permit application.

Judge Penelope Richard cited the close vicinity of other export terminals as a factor in her decision, saying the state “failed to consider the secondary and cumulative impacts” of these facilities on climate change in the coastal zone.

“We hope this ruling shakes Louisiana to its senses,” said Anne Rolfes, director of Louisiana Bucket Brigade. “The coastal use permit needs to be revoked.”

Rolfes’s organization, the Sierra Club and the Turtle Island Restoration Network filed the suit in August 2024.

“This is an area of the Louisiana coastline that is being devastated by LNG facilities,” said Joanie Steinhaus, ocean program director for Turtle Island Restoration Network. “These agencies have long ignored the cumulative impact to air and water quality and the health of the local community members and the environment”

There was no immediate response to attempts Tuesday to reach Commonwealth LNG about the court ruling.

Another lawsuit in a U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit rejected the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s approval of the project, citing its pollution impact. The decision delayed construction for two months until a new permit reevaluated the full impact of air pollution harms.

This move signals a full-throttle return to growth for Stellantis in what is one of its most critical markets globally.
Success in America is not just good for Stellantis in the U.S., it makes us stronger everywhere,” – Antonio Filosa, CEO and North America COO, Stellantis.
The $400 million investment and 900 added jobs show a clear intent to compete directly with segment leaders like the popular Toyota Tacoma and Ford Ranger.
Meanwhile, Detroit’s Jefferson complex will be readied for the next-generation Dodge Durango in 2029 with an additional $130 million investment.","Following the controversial exit of Carlos Tavares in December last year, Stellantis appointed Jeep’s growth architect, Antonio Filosa, as its new CEO in May. Stellantis is one of the world’s leading Automotive conglomerates, formed in 2021 after the merger of FCA and PSA, with 14 brands under its umbrella.

He was tasked with steering the fourth-largest automaker in the world towards profitability following turbulent times for several key brands within the portfolio. His priority was to stabilize the North American business by moving some production back to the U.S., introducing competitive pricing strategies, and offering a fresh vehicle lineup across the brand’s core markets.

Filosa’s arrival was quickly followed by the return of another key figure in the Stellantis hierarchy, Tim Kuniskis. A key figure responsible for the success of the modern era of the Dodge brand, Kuniskis was brought back to lead the conglomerate’s North American comeback as Head of American Brands and North American Marketing and Retail Strategy, while also taking charge as CEO of the Truck brand. He now oversees Chrysler, Jeep, and Dodge, working to tighten marketing strategies and rebuild dealer confidence. A major announcement he made was the return of RAM Trucks to NASCAR.

Now, in what is the largest single investment in the company’s 100-year history, a $13 billion investment marks the first major step in that broader recovery plan. Stellantis will expand U.S. production by 50 percent and create more than 5,000 jobs across the states of Illinois, Ohio, Michigan, and Indiana. This move signals a full-throttle return to growth for Stellantis in what is one of its most critical markets globally.

“Accelerating growth in the U.S. has been a top priority since my first day. Success in America is not just good for Stellantis in the U.S., it makes us stronger everywhere,” – Antonio Filosa, CEO and North America COO, Stellantis.

In Illinois, Stellantis will reopen the Belvidere Assembly Plant to produce two new Jeep models, the mid-size Cherokee and compact Compass SUVs, backed by a $600 million infusion and around 3,300 new jobs. It’s a strategic move that brings production back to the Midwest, reaffirming Jeep’s American manufacturing roots. Over in Toledo, Ohio, Stellantis will assemble an all-new midsize truck previously destined for Belvidere alongside the Wrangler and Gladiator pickup. The $400 million investment and 900 added jobs show a clear intent to compete directly with segment leaders like the popular Toyota Tacoma and Ford Ranger.

The state of Michigan will see Warren Truck Assembly retooled to build a large SUV in both internal-combustion and range-extended EV forms in 2028, with nearly $100 million in upgrades and 900 new positions. Meanwhile, Detroit’s Jefferson complex will be readied for the next-generation Dodge Durango in 2029 with an additional $130 million investment.

Finally, Indiana’s Kokomo facilities will produce the new GMET4 EVO four-cylinder engine starting in 2026, supported by $100 million in funding and 100 new jobs. This new powertrain is part of Stellantis’ broader plan to balance performance and efficiency across its lineup. In total, Stellantis’ U.S. footprint now spans 34 facilities across 14 states, employing over 48,000 people, setting the stage for five new models, 19 product updates, and a projected 50 percent production jump by 2029. This strategic investment is the first major step on the path to recovery and better positions Stellantis to compete with the likes of Ford and GM, which together represent the Detroit Big Three.

GILBERT, Ariz., Oct. 14, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Legacy EV , a leader in electric vehicle education and conversion technology, has partnered with SmarterHelp, an independent workforce development company spun out from ChargerHelp!, to launch a joint training solution designed to prepare technicians for every part of the EV ecosystem — from the car to the charger.

The partnership aligns two industry leaders with a shared mission: to close the talent gap in clean transportation by offering scalable, hands-on training programs for schools, workforce boards, and technical organizations nationwide.

The bundled program begins with a shared introductory course, ""Intro to EV Jobs,"" which covers electrical theory, high-voltage safety, charging systems, and industry standards. From there, learners can choose one of two certification pathways:

EV Technician Pathway (Legacy EV): Focused on vehicle systems, diagnostics, and battery management.

EVSE Technician Pathway (SmarterHelp): Focused on charger commissioning, and maintenance.

""The EV revolution depends as much on people as it does on technology,"" said Mavrick Knoles, President of Legacy EV . ""This partnership gives learners a clear, industry-aligned path to meaningful careers in clean transportation — the kind of work that's shaping the future of mobility.""

""SmarterHelp's mission is to make green jobs accessible to everyone, especially in communities that have historically been left out of the clean-energy economy,"" said Kianna Scott, CEO of SmarterHelp . ""Together with Legacy EV, we're connecting the dots between vehicle and infrastructure training to build a workforce ready to keep the EV industry moving forward.""

According to the U.S. Department of Energy, more than 6 million clean-energy jobs will be created by 2035, with electric vehicles representing one of the fastest-growing segments. Yet only a fraction of today's workforce has the skills required to build and maintain these systems. By combining expertise in both vehicle electrification and charging infrastructure, Legacy EV and SmarterHelp are helping bridge that gap and accelerate workforce readiness for the clean-energy transition.

The new bundled training solution will be available to workforce boards, community colleges, and training organizations nationwide beginning in Q1 2026.

Dippel, www.facebook.com",,,,,https://thefulcrum.us/democracy/money-in-politics-and-congress,"Members of Congress could destroy it by neglecting the good of the country in favor of narrow, self-serving ends.

Perhaps most regrettably, Congress members no longer accept inquiries, suggestions, or criticism from persons residing out of state or out of district.","James Madison tried to warn us. He foresaw a grave danger to our fragile republic. No, it wasn’t an overreaching, dictatorial President. It was the people’s representatives themselves who might shred the untested constitutional fabric of the nascent United States.

Members of Congress could destroy it by neglecting the good of the country in favor of narrow, self-serving ends. Unity would collapse into endless internecine strife. Madison sounded this alarm in Federalist No. 10: he foresaw the inevitable emergence of “factions”—political parties “united and actuated by some common impulse of passion, or of interest, adverse to the rights of other citizens, or to the permanent and aggregate interests of the community.”

This invidious but inevitable human inclination could only be held in check if elected representatives could transcend their parochial outlook by interacting with delegates from other states and regions, with other points of view. By doing so, they would become broadly knowledgeable about vital national issues such as interstate commerce, taxes, and defense, and then enact laws that would benefit the country as a whole. If this expanding of the political horizon did not occur, Congress would either grind to a halt in hopeless deadlock or—worse—one party would exercise monopoly power over minorities.

The checks on congressional power embedded in the Constitution have so far prevented one of Madison’s fears from materializing: we see one such guardrail working—albeit messily—in the current impasse over federal expenditures. But a debilitating divisiveness has not been prevented. Today, Democrats and Republicans spend most of their time demonizing and blaming one another, stubbornly refusing to compromise. Most of the reasons for this are well understood—Citizens United, the loosening of restrictions on political contributions, the necessity of raising enormous amounts of money for campaigns, and the concomitant need to cater to well-to-do ideologues for contributions. But there is another, less apparent development that has dissuaded members of Congress from working together. This form of factionalism has infected Washington and isolated it. It has led lawmakers to think less and less about the People and focus more on the voters who elected them.

This represents a subtle but dramatic change from the ideal of national service. (The Constitution is vague about the duties and obligations of Congress, making this devolution possible.) It is evident, for example, in how Washington lawmakers see themselves differently. Whereas they once referred to their home states and districts as where they came from, they now affirm on their websites that this is whom they work for. If you visit the Capitol with a pass to your own representative or senator’s office, you won’t be welcomed in any others: they only serve their constituents. Perhaps most regrettably, Congress members no longer accept inquiries, suggestions, or criticism from persons residing out of state or out of district. (Campaign checks are welcomed, however.)

Half a century ago, you could write to Ted Kennedy, William Fulbright, Birch Bayh, and other Senate luminaries and not only would your letter be read, but you’d also receive a signed response addressing the issue you had raised. (I still treasure them, like papyrus scrolls.) In effect, your Congress is not the 435 members of the House and 50 members of the Senate: it has been reduced to just three lawmakers—two senators and a single House representative. In other words, your ability to potentially have influence on legislation has shrunk by over 99 percent. Constituents are fooling themselves if they think their representatives will personally read what they have written: the daily flood of emails and letters makes that impossible.

As their connections to the American people have been drastically reduced, members of Congress have increasingly focused on pleasing the people (voters) back home. Most of the tasks performed in their offices involve “casework”—fielding requests for tours and for flags flown over the Capitol, helping obtain government benefits, and providing guidance in applying for the service academies. Lawmakers also endear themselves by “bringing home the bacon”—obtaining federal funds for local organizations and projects, showing how they can “deliver.” But this assistance has nothing to do with passing laws. Even constituents can feel left out of that process as senators and representatives depend heavily on advice from lobbyists and contributions from special-interest groups and large donors to determine their votes. In this money-saturated climate, the “public interest” becomes difficult to discern, let alone honor. And it is no wonder that most ordinary Americans feel left out. Or that they become apathetic and disengage from politics.

But, for members of Congress, this new relationship has worked well. Making themselves popular by doing favors sets them apart from their colleagues in an increasingly unpopular branch of government. And serving constituent needs instead of the general good has been a winning strategy for legislators. In the 2024 election, for example, 96.6 percent of sitting representatives were returned to office. As one watchdog organization has sardonically put it, “Few things in life are more predictable than the chances of an incumbent member of the U.S. House of Representatives winning reelection.”

What, if anything, can be done to close this breach between lawmakers and the people? Given the makeup of the Supreme Court for the foreseeable future, there seems little likelihood of its overturning rulings allowing big money to have such an inordinate influence on elections. In order to change Congress’s ways, we will have to change the incentives that motivate its members’ behavior. Money is the most salient determinant. But how can “small” donors hope to have a greater impact than big ones? The answer would be: by collectively backing candidates from all parts of the country and from both parties who are committed to overcoming partisan gridlock and getting things done. Voters need to be proactive and empower themselves rather than passively let self-serving political organizations and wealthy contributors set the agenda and choose candidates for them. This goal could be accomplished through an online, interactive people’s forum dedicated to informing the public about candidates’ views, providing feedback to politicians, and donating to ones favoring legislative accomplishment over ideology. As such a forum expands, office seekers would become more broadly aware of public opinion and responsive to it. Money will still speak. But if it is going to continue to dominate electoral politics, isn’t it better to double down on this game than to throw in the towel and walk away?

John V. H. Dippel, an independent historian, has written several books on various topics in modern American and European history. In the late 1960s, he successfully petitioned several Senators to take up the cause of increasing First Amendment rights for members of the U.S. military. He welcomes the chance to lay out the case for doing so now through The Fulcrum.

""The issue for the oil companies is that they know they did it,"" Richard Wiles, president of the nonprofit Center for Climate Integrity, told AFP.

""The issue for the oil companies is that they know they did it,"" Richard Wiles, president of the nonprofit Center for Climate Integrity, told AFP.

""Their only avenue out of this is to get some kind of a waiver of liability, make the cases go away, bar the courthouse doors, get a 'get out of jail free card.'""

Dozens of cases modeled on successful actions against the tobacco industry in the 1990s are playing out in state courts nationwide -- including claims of injuries, failure to warn, and even racketeering, meaning acting like a criminal enterprise.

Some have been dismissed, and none have yet gone to trial -- though crucially, the conservative-dominated Supreme Court has repeatedly declined to intervene and block them.

- 'They have no shame' -

In June, 16 Republican state attorneys general urged the Trump administration to enact a shield law to end such cases.

""Under the banner of 'global climate change,' they have effectively declared an all-out war on traditional American energy,"" their letter said, calling the lawsuits ""lawfare against the energy industry.""

It faulted the Supreme Court for not moving the cases to federal court, where companies believe they stand a better chance of winning, and cited a 2005 statute granting gunmakers a similar liability shield.

""They have no shame,"" said Pat Parenteau, an emeritus professor of environmental law at the University of Vermont, pointing to the epidemic of gun violence. ""I mean, come on, that's your argument?""

Congress has yet to act, but observers see worrying signs it may be edging closer. A recent appropriations bill for the District of Columbia would bar the city from using funds to enforce consumer protection laws ""against oil and gas companies for environmental claims.""

And just last week, more than 100 House Republicans filed a friend-of-the-court brief in one Colorado case, urging the Supreme Court to ""put an end to these unconstitutional attempts to dictate national energy policy.""

AFP contacted Nebraska and West Virginia, which led the letter, as well as the Department of Justice, oil majors ExxonMobil, Shell, Chevron and BP, and the American Petroleum Institute. None responded.

- Coordinated campaign -

The Trump administration, for its part, has escalated attacks on Democrat-led states passing ""polluter pays"" laws -- suing for example New York and Vermont to block ""Superfunds"" that would require companies to pay billions toward climate and extreme weather resilience.

The Justice Department has also asked the Supreme Court to weigh in through a friend-of-the-court brief in the Colorado case, where the state's top court allowed Boulder County to proceed with its lawsuit against Suncor Energy.

A constellation of conservative legal scholars has joined what appears to be a coordinated push, including a FoxNews.com op-ed by John Yoo -- author of the Bush-era ""torture memos"" -- urging the Supreme Court to ""reaffirm federal authority over national energy.""

Results in the cases have so far have been mixed: oil firms have won dismissals in some states, while others have allowed cases to advance.

""There hasn't been a big verdict yet. It's not clear there's going to be a big verdict. And you've always got the Supreme Court lurking in the background,"" said Parenteau.

That may explain why Congress has hesitated to act, he added -- though ""given the craziness that's going on in America right now, anything's possible.""

Environmental groups have urged Democrats to hold firm, and this summer, the 3,000-member National Association of Counties passed a resolution opposing ""any legislation that would limit or preempt counties' access to courts or give companies immunity from lawsuits.""

Brigid Shea, commissioner for Texas' Travis County, who helped lead the resolution, told AFP local governments were being ""walloped"" by extreme weather. ""We have to protect our access to the courts,"" she said. ""This is fundamental to our democratic process.""

A professor of Earth and planetary sciences, Zaitchik's brow furrowed as he talked about the state of environmental health research in an era of extreme weather. In a nutshell: It's not good.

""In Baltimore, excessive rainwater pours into an aging infrastructure and underground water-flow channels that are, in many cases, unknown and complicated,"" he continued. ""The soil doesn't stay frozen as long in January, and it rains much more than it snows."" These conditions beget floods. And floods beget sewage backups and mold, which beget health problems, home-repair expenses, decreased property values, and stress.

But Baltimore faces additional challenges—many of them representative of those seen in dozens of other midsized industrial cities in the United States, Zaitchik said. Among the challenges: a stagnant population, rising temperatures and heat, and water and air pollution.

Remedies exist for these problems, and Zaitchik and his colleagues want to help devise solutions. They applied for and won a five-year, $25 million grant through the Department of Energy, one for which they teamed up with universities, utility companies, city agencies, and community organizations across the mid-Atlantic region to determine the best path forward. This past March, however, in the fourth year of their work, the federal government pulled back the funding.

Like hundreds of environmental scientists across the United States, Zaitchik received news from the DOE that his grant had been defunded—a brief phone call to say his work no longer aligned with the DOE's mission. The news didn't surprise him, considering the number of grants being canceled around him. ""But it enraged me [to see] the disrespect for our work, the loss of opportunity for our students, and, most importantly, the signal that these communities shouldn't have the science they need to thrive,"" Zaitchik said.

A troubling trend

Zaitchik's project is one of countless federally funded environmental health research projects across the country that have been terminated or scaled back over the past nine months. Federal actions have also reversed a number of climate-related policies and programs created to protect the public from environmental health hazards. According to Columbia University's Sabin Center for Climate Change Law, which tracks such efforts, this includes:

Putting out of commission (and no longer updating) several long-established data-gathering systems related to extreme weather, including the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's tracker of billion-dollar disasters

Issuing an executive order directing the attorney general to prevent states from enforcing policies that address extreme weather, environmental justice, pollution, and related topics

Rescinding policies that encourage the development of renewable energies like wind and solar

Exempting coal-fired power plants, chemical manufacturing plants, commercial sterilization facilities using ethylene oxide (a toxin linked to neurological and respiratory symptoms and cancer), and certain iron-ore processing sources from national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants for two years

The administration has also proposed canceling the finding that greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane harm human health—the so-called ""endangerment finding"" (2009) that enables the Environmental Protection Agency to regulate pollution from power plants, factories, oil and gas companies, cars, and other sources. If this finding were to be reversed—a move that requires approval from Congress—companies would be able to pollute as much as they want, without fear of fines and penalties. A move like this, scientists say, would increase the public's risk of heart and lung disease, as well as other ailments caused by pollutants.

""It's strange to be rushing head on into these hazards and say, 'Well, we're just going to close our eyes [to extreme weather] and not try to get ready. This will only hurt and cost more in the long run.""

Benjamin Zaitchik

Professor of Earth and planetary sciences, Johns Hopkins University

Moreover, these changes disproportionately affect people living in low-income areas, who are more likely to live near major roadways, ports, and factories, Zaitchik said.

The trickle-down effect puts the entire field of environmental science at stake, with a legion of scientists being forced to eliminate post-doctoral positions and reduce graduate student enrollment. Zaitchik said many grants have been canceled simply because they included words or language previously mandated by federal diversity requirements.

""Give me the chance, and I will write those words out of our project descriptions,"" he said. ""But allow us to train the next generation of scientists and continue work already underway.""

'A big unknown'

How extreme weather affects urban areas ""is currently a big unknown,"" said Zaitchik, principal investigator of the now-defunded DOE research project known as the Baltimore Social-Environmental Collaborative. Part of the DOE's Urban Integrated Field Lab, the overarching five-year project aimed to determine how extreme weather not just in Baltimore but also in Chicago; Beaumont-Port Arthur, Texas; and Phoenix affects each region's energy, water, and economics sectors. These cities already experience pressing challenges and ensuing costs and health risks from extreme weather, and multidisciplinary teams were put in place to gather data and use what they learn to protect each region's communities.

The teams span multiple institutions and organizations. In Baltimore, for instance, scientists and public health scholars from Johns Hopkins formed partnerships with teams from Morgan State University, Pennsylvania State University, Baltimore Gas and Electric, and the Baltimore City Office of Public Utilities—plus other agencies and community organizations. In other regions, partners ranged from Chicago State University, the University of Illinois–Urbana-Champaign, and Northwestern University to North Carolina A&T University, the University of Texas at Austin, Texas A&M University, Arizona State University, and the University of Arizona, along with an assortment of utility companies, city agencies, and community organizations.

For the projects in all four cities, the DOE defunded 75% of the grant's fourth year and 100% of its fifth year, essentially halting support for the work after investing in and putting in place the equipment, teams of people, and infrastructure to make it happen, Zaitchik said.

Darryn Waugh, professor of Earth and planetary sciences at Johns Hopkins, works on the project with Zaitchik. He ventured across Baltimore talking to community members and installing and maintaining weather-monitoring stations at churches, recreation centers, schools, and other public places. His goal: collect data on everything from temperature and humidity to wind, precipitation, and pollution—and use it to learn how extreme weather and air quality affect the region's health, economics, and energy supply. Previously, only one weather-monitoring station existed in Baltimore, at the Inner Harbor, and ""you cannot tell how heat and rainfall vary across the city from a single station,"" Waugh said.

Without data to paint a clear picture of what's happening, cities can't prepare for the powerful hurricanes and storms, extensive rainfall and droughts, wildfires, and other weather-related events that are already upon us, Waugh and Zaitchik said. They can't conduct financial analyses to determine the most cost-efficient remedies, and they can't predict the energy demands that are already shifting in what science confirms to be an era of extreme weather.

""Cities and states have budgets and can't fix everything,"" Zaitchik said. ""They have to prioritize, and that can't happen in the dark.""

Waugh also serves as principal investigator of a three-year, $1.5 million NASA grant to study air pollution in Baltimore neighborhoods with heavy traffic. These neighborhoods tend to be low-income areas where residents neither own cars nor contribute to the pollution—but nevertheless can suffer the health-related consequences, Waugh said.

Unlike the DOE grant, which was defunded but not completely terminated, ""we received a stop-work notice on the NASA grant because it involved an environmental justice angle to help communities of color and communities in need,"" he explained, referring to the federal government's executive order issued this past January to cease all environmental-justice-related work across the United States, regardless of the specifics.

""We spent years planning the steps, building the systems and teams, and doing the rigorous work it takes to apply for and receive funding, only to have support for our grants up and ended, with no explanation or discussion,"" Waugh said. ""I've worked at Hopkins for 27 years and never seen anything like this.""

A series of setbacks

Cancelled grants at Johns Hopkins also include a three-year Environmental Protection Agency award for work to identify the components of biosolids— essentially ""sewage sludge""—used to fertilize crops across the country.

""Biosolids are processed human sewage sludge, and they've been contentious forever because of the potential health risks,"" Keeve Nachman, a professor in environmental health and engineering in the university's Bloomberg School of Public Health, said. ""Many of the chemicals in biosolids are both unknown and unregulated, and there are concerns that people being exposed to those chemicals are possibly getting sick.""

Workers who transport biosolids from wastewater treatment plants and spread them on farms experience the most exposure, Nachman said. But given that biosolids are used to fertilize the food we eat, and the food animals eat, and given that runoff from farms can get into our drinking water, most people are exposed at some level, he explained. And the risks and consequences remain unknown.

Carsten Prasse, the grant's principal investigator and an associate professor of environmental health and engineering at JHU's Whiting School of Engineering, worked with Nachman and Sara Lupolt, an assistant scientist in environmental health and engineering, to interview employees of farms that use biosolids. Their biggest finding: Workers face a potentially high level of exposure to toxic chemicals through biosolids, but the EPA doesn't know how much—and hasn't factored workers into their risk assessments and safety guidelines on biosolids. This means, for instance, that farm workers use personal protective equipment inconsistently. And when the machines they use to spread biosolids get clogged with sewage sludge and break down (which happens routinely), they often resort to cleaning the equipment by hand—and risk direct exposure to harmful chemicals.

Prasse and his team, including post-doctoral fellows, doctoral candidates, and other students in his lab, conducted a simulated experiment that involved growing crops on a plot of land and applying biosolids as a fertilizer. Next, they collected samples to determine the chemical makeup and conducted controlled studies to investigate the exposure level to biosolids on crops and workers. Funding for the work was terminated, however, right as Prasse started to identify and analyze the chemicals—in other words, right as his team inched toward their first results.

""We use around 80,000 chemicals in our homes in household products—detergents, cosmetics, personal care products, pharmaceuticals,"" Prasse said. ""All of these things go down the drain, and most aren't really removed in wastewater."" In the case of biosolids, he continued, ""they contain not just bacteria but everything flushed down the toilet like prescription drugs, pesticides, and industrial chemicals like PFAS"" that are known to cause health problems. ""All of this sticks to the organic material of biosolids.""

The halt in funding is unfortunate for many reasons, Prasse said, including his team's unique ability to identify the array of chemicals—and the quantity of each chemical—in soil and plant samples. In his lab, Prasse uses high-resolution mass spectrometry, a state-of-the-art analytical chemistry technique, to measure the mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of ions with utmost precision and zero in on the elemental composition of compounds. Now, however, his use of the tool is being cut short, owing to the EPA's decision to stop funding the grant.

Both Prasse and Nachman have had other environmental health-related grants descoped or terminated this past year, despite findings that their research can lead to cost-cutting measures and public health safety. ""In the case of air pollution, every dollar spent on the Clean Air Act results in a $25 to $30 return on investment in terms of health preventions or in terms of disease avoidance,"" Nachman said. ""I mean, that's stunning. How many programs do we have where we get that kind of return on investment?

""This isn't money thrown away,"" he continued. ""It's money that has high return and tremendous societal benefit.""

Zaitchik and Waugh shared similar sentiments, struggling to comprehend the rationale. After all, the grant cancelations and scaled-back funding coincide with a clear uptick in extreme weather, meaning that time is of the essence to gather the data and do the work needed to prepare, they explained.

""It's strange to be rushing head on into these hazards and say, 'Well, we're just going to close our eyes [to extreme weather] and not try to get ready,'"" Zaitchik said. ""This will only hurt and cost more in the long run.""",https://api.hub.jhu.edu/factory/sites/default/files/styles/soft_crop_1300/public/2025-10/Darryn%20Waugh_JHZ9962.jpg,N,,2025-10-15 07:02:05.016482

Three: “Energy Costs Are Up Because We Burn Less Coal” — No, Not Really Yes, energy prices have risen — but across the board.","My sincere thanks to Senator Brian Helton for joining Talkline Tuesday. Debate is essential — and in an energy state like West Virginia, more debate on energy policy isn’t just healthy, it’s necessary.

Before diving in, I’d suggest reading my earlier commentary on this topic or catching Tuesday’s interview with Senator Helton (above).

Energy is a complicated subject; details matter — good or bad, that’s the way it is.

And apologies in advance for a bit of a lengthy piece today. My pen just wouldn’t stop.

Where We Differ

Fundamentally, Senator Helton and I disagree.

He believes requiring utilities to run coal plants at least 69 percent of the time — even when they’re not the least-cost option — would deliver a macro-economic boost to West Virginia, including roughly 3,500 new jobs.

I believe his legislation would increase power bills for West Virginians who already struggle to afford them, while doing little to curb renewables as he desires and potentially harm the state’s natural gas industry in the process.

Decide for yourself; here’s my case.

One: Markets, Not Politics, Should Drive Decisions

Markets are the best arbiters of economic decisions — not politics. Helton’s bill would take markets out of the decision-making process 69 percent of the time.

He argues this would “level the playing field” for coal. But the data shows coal’s challenge isn’t unfair competition — it’s economics.

According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, electricity produced from natural gas ran about $26.50 per MWh (July 2025), based on Henry Hub pricing. It’s important to note Henry Hub pricing doesn’t account for any typical “negative basis” – essentially a lower price than Hub – on locally sourced West Virginia gas.

Electricity produced from Central Appalachian coal tallied $36.69 per MWh. That’s a significant $10 gap or 40% difference.

Common sense check: if you’re driving down the road and gasoline at one station is $2.80 a gallon and $2.00 at the other – 40 percent cheaper – where would you stop?

There’s more.

Gas plants typically operate at 50-plus percent thermal efficiency; coal units, in the low 30s. That makes coal significantly more expensive on a per-MWh basis than natural gas.

As someone with knowledge of power plant operations pointed out to me, you need pulverizers and other equipment that must be powered to crush coal to make it useable in a boiler. Gas plants don’t require fly ash removal equipment and the operating costs that come along with it. The list goes on. With natural gas, you just pump it in from a pipe. Translation: more variable cost with coal.

Because PJM dispatches generation based on marginal cost — mostly driven by fuel, heat rate and other variable costs and efficiencies — gas plants are called upon more often. They’re cheaper, and customers want the cheapest reliable power.

Helton goes further saying renewables are subsidized creating an unfair environment for coal. That’s true. Most renewables enjoy investment or production tax credits made available by the Inflation Reduction Act. But those credits help investors cover the upfront costs of creating wind or solar farms, they don’t – by market rules governing bid calculation – play into establishing marginal costs – they don’t drive energy output price one way or another. It’s fair to say these credits would decrease upfront capital costs and drive capacity costs or the cost of physical equipment (fixed).

All told, Helton’s proposal would ignore these economic and physical realities, forcing coal plants to run even when they’re uneconomic compared to other available units.

My premise in a nutshell: If you need a law to make a plant run, the market already told you it’s not the most economical plant. Listen to it.

Two: “At Least We’d Use Our Coal” — Not So Fast

Helton argues using our coal will displace wind or solar – a “Green New Deal” scam in his words.

That sounds good politically, but it’s not what would actually happen.

According to PJM’s independent market monitor, natural gas set the locational marginal price (LMP) — the price that clears the market — about 74% of the time last year. Coal set it 13%, and all other sources, including renewables, set pricing the remaining 12–13%.

If West Virginia coal units are forced to run uneconomically, the generation most likely displaced wouldn’t be solar or wind — it would be natural gas as it sets the price the majority of the time.

Remember: wind and solar have zero fuel cost. The wind and sun are free. That means when they’re available, they’ll almost always be dispatched.

Helton is right that renewables aren’t as reliable — the sun doesn’t always shine, and the wind doesn’t always blow — but PJM already accounts for that. Renewables are only credited for about 10–15% of their nameplate capacity in the capacity market. In other words, 100 MW of solar is treated as 10–15 MW of dependable capacity — far less than gas, coal, or nuclear. That means renewables do not earn nearly as much capacity revenue as plants that use the former fuel sources.

Three: “Energy Costs Are Up Because We Burn Less Coal” — No, Not Really

Yes, energy prices have risen — but across the board. Using a more expensive fuel more often won’t fix that. It will make it worse.

According to Helton, AEP testified that part of the increase in rates comes from West Virginia’s declining population. That’s true. Fixed costs — poles, transformers, power plants — are spread over fewer customers. Fewer customers to cover the same nut means each customer must pay more.

But Helton confuses those fixed costs with marginal ones.

Electricity is priced on marginal cost – the cost to produce the next required MWh to keep the grid running. Running coal plants 69% of the time won’t change those fixed expenses – running plants 100 percent wouldn’t either, just as not running them at all wouldn’t.

It all just means ratepayers will pay more than they otherwise would for electricity on top of the increasing fixed cost burden. A double whammy!

Another reason for increased electricity prices not noted in Helton’s argument: we’re using more electricity. AI needs more juice. Demand increases mean price increases, especially when supply is constrained via regulation. Building new generation is a massive, slow undertaking.

Four: If It’s a Good Bet, the State Should Take the Risk

Forget my previous points for a moment.

Helton believes his plan would be good for West Virginia. He wants more coal jobs. That’s understandable and I’m not questioning his or others’ sincerity who believe the same.

But at what expense? Are 3,500 coal jobs worth higher electricity bills for the (estimated) more than 1 million customers AEP and First Energy serve? Is that gain worth possible displacement of natural gas jobs? If gas-fired plants run less, you don’t need as much gas, so you don’t need as many people to bring it out of the ground. A job added in one industry is ok if it costs a job in another?

And what about economic development? Why would the “next” Nucor choose West Virginia if our power costs are artificially higher than in neighboring states? They wouldn’t.

I remain steadfast. The legislature should vote red on the bill if it comes to the floor. It may pass the Senate, but my conversations with House members lead me to believe it would be dead on arrival in that chamber.

That being said, if Helton and his colleagues believe in the plan — if this plan would indeed net boost the economy on the whole — then the state should take all the risk, not ratepayers.

If lawmakers want to require coal plants to run for fixed periods of time, they should also require that any added costs above market price of using non-economically dispatched generation be paid from the state’s Rainy Day Fund, not through higher utility bills or new taxes.

If the plan works as well as promised, those new jobs and tax revenues will replenish the fund, no? If it doesn’t, ratepayers wouldn’t be left holding the bag, the state would.

That’s a fair ask. Such an added provision wouldn’t put Toby and Edith directly on the hook – they didn’t ask for more risk or higher bills – as the proposal does now.",https://wvmetronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/metronews-plug.jpg,N,,2025-10-15 13:09:44.973433

Violet Ikonomova is an investigative reporter at the Free Press focused on government and police accountability in Detroit.","In 2018, as thousands of Detroit households faced water shutoffs or tax foreclosures, a then-31-year-old Councilmember Mary Sheffield stood before city hall to unveil the “People’s Bills,” a sweeping package of housing affordability and other proposals designed to protect the city’s most vulnerable residents.

The headline-grabbing plans were among some of the boldest from a Detroit City Council member in recent memory, according to several political watchers. But they drew swift resistance from Mayor Mike Duggan’s more fiscally conservative regime. With a council majority then in Duggan’s corner, the proposals would yield mixed results, ending in a blend of wins, losses and political compromise.

An apt metaphor for Sheffield’s political career: Political observers say Sheffield’s achievements are notable for a council member who was for years in the political minority in a city with a strong-mayor form of government and law department that serves both the mayor and the council.

Former Councilmember Raquel Castañeda-López, who served with Sheffield for her first two terms, said Sheffield struck a balance between policy ambition and coalition-building, both on the council and in the community.

“She was better and more successful at collaborating than I was,” said Castañeda-López, who has not endorsed a candidate for mayor. “All of us have made promises we couldn’t fulfill. But … sometimes when legislation doesn’t happen, you’re able to make change in other ways.”

In her 12 years as a council policymaker, Sheffield often aimed high and got some of what she wanted, but was forced to scale back parts of her most ambitious populist visions amid pressure from the mayor’s office. Now, as a frontrunner for the city’s top job as she faces off against the Rev. Solomon Kinloch of Triumph Church, she says she may revive some of those proposals that previously stalled — if she wins.

Not surprisingly, her opponent has taken a harsher view of her council tenure, accusing Sheffield of “12 years of failed leadership” and “delivering headlines without delivering progress.” The pastor has never held elected office and does not have a comparable record to scrutinize.

However, current and former council members who spoke with the Free Press said Sheffield consistently followed through when possible, and helped elevate visibility around issues she couldn’t legislate.

“She is a person, if she puts something out there, she believes in it and I think is willing to die on that sword getting it across the finish line,” Councilmember Fred Durhal, who ran against Sheffield for mayor in the primary and has since endorsed her, said.

Sheffield’s achievements include key ordinances to increase housing stability and improve working conditions for those employed by city contractors or certain industries. Sheffield also has notched wins with ordinances that required compromise, like a 50% parking ticket rate reduction for Detroiters who pay early.

But Sheffield never introduced promised ordinances to increase Detroit hiring on publicly funded construction projects and her proposal to tie water rates to household incomes — which she once called her “most crucial” initiative. She also has thus far come up empty handed in her quest to reimburse property owners who were overtaxed by the city.

In response to Free Press questions, the now-council president said she has spearheaded approximately two dozen successful ordinances, resolutions and budget appropriations. Of proposals she could not get off the ground, Sheffield blamed legal obstacles raised by Duggan’s administration, but said they still helped increase awareness of the socioeconomic issues affecting Detroiters.

“When I came to council, these were issues that people didn’t want to talk about,” she said. “I’m very proud we passed a majority of them. And on those we didn’t, we pushed the conversation.”

Wins

Sheffield took office in 2014 as the youngest-ever Detroit councilmember, and in her second term unfurled a grassroots and union activist-guided agenda that put her at odds with budget-conscious and development-friendly Duggan, who was then supported by a council majority. Things shifted in Sheffield’s third term, when a number of newcomers joined the council and voted her president, and an infusion of federal pandemic relief funds made a broad range of initiatives possible. Duggan has since endorsed Sheffield for mayor.

Sheffield has led the passage of two key ordinances to address the drivers of tax foreclosure, including a 2023 measure targeting inflated property assessments and a 2018 measure easing barriers to a property tax exemption for the poor that has helped more than double the number of tax-exempt households in the city.

In 2022, she spearheaded an ordinance to provide free legal representation to Detroiters facing eviction after reporting found 1 in 5 Detroit renters face eviction each year, often by landlords who themselves operate illegally. The Right to Counsel program has since boosted the percentage of those with lawyers from 4% before the pandemic to up to 70% this year, those involved say.

Sheffield also led the creation of a 2023 “responsible contracting” ordinance that gives preference to contractors who offer employee benefits and meet other criteria, and a 2021 “industry standards boards” ordinance aimed to improve conditions for workers employed in certain industries, like the city’s stadiums or arenas.

In 2021, she won an ordinance increasing transparency around surveillance technologies after the city was sued at least three times by people who alleged they were wrongfully arrested by Detroit police using facial recognition software.

Political push-pull

Other proposals fell short of goals, typically through compromise with the administration.

In 2017, Sheffield sought to require developers receiving city incentives to designate a portion of rental units as affordable for households earning as little as 50% of the region’s median income. The Duggan administration, however, won an amendment raising that threshold to 80% — or $56,600 for an individual — far above what the average Detroiter earns.

Sheffield sought to counteract the ordinance’s limitations by attaching an “affordable housing trust fund” for those living at as little as 30% area median income. She has since grown the fund to $15 million by capturing 40% of city commercial land sales. If elected mayor, she says she would raise the percentage collected to at least 90% and revisit the requirements on developers.

Her effort to repay city property owners after a 2020 news report found they were overtaxed by a collective $600 million also has involved some political jockeying. The Duggan administration has interpreted state law to mean they can’t be repaid. And Sheffield, in 2022, requested a separate legal opinion from Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel on the issue. She was rebuffed, and now says she’ll push to change the law in Lansing if elected mayor.

As an alternative to repayment, Sheffield in 2022 led the creation of a package of city programmatic and discount offerings for those who were overtaxed, like half-off Detroit Land Bank Authority homes and first dibs on affordable housing.

The plan represented another political tug of war: Duggan, two years earlier, had proposed a $6 million package that would have applied to those overtaxed from 2010 – 2013, but Sheffield rejected it, calling its price tag and eligibility years inadequate. The plan Sheffield ultimately helped pass was funded at the same dollar amount, but with eligibility expanded through 2016. (Residents have until the end of the year to apply for the offerings; approximately 700 residents have already done so or are in the process.)

Meanwhile, at least one high-profile Sheffield effort has been stymied without the Duggan factor. A task force Sheffield helped establish to recommend reparations for Detroiters harmed by historic racism is now a year behind schedule after problems involving one of her appointees who helped create the group.

Proposals left behind

While Sheffield’s movements on housing and other issues made headlines, two “People’s Bills” were never introduced.

A marquee plan to tie water rates to household income was dropped after Duggan said it would violate state law. Sheffield later said she developed a workaround — treating discounted rates as “bad debt” — but ultimately abandoned that too, citing the same legal concerns. She said the fight then moved to Lansing, where a state bill she supports now mirrors her original proposal.

Duggan, meanwhile, launched the Lifeline water assistance program in 2022, calling it the city’s “first income-based water affordability” program. The program, however, relied on pandemic relief funds that have since run out. Sheffield said she continues to push for state funding to sustain it.

Sheffield also never introduced an ordinance to expand a Duggan executive order requiring publicly funded construction projects to give a majority of work hours to Detroiters. Her 2018 proposal would have lowered the investment threshold for the requirement to kick in from $3 million to $500,000, but, she said, was ultimately blocked by a legal interpretation that the City Council can’t set contracting terms.

Still, Sheffield pointed to the administration’s eventual decision to ensure the hiring mandate applied to demolition projects as a result of her efforts. If elected mayor, she said she would only revive the proposal once she can ensure contractors actually comply — according to a recent BridgeDetroit report, none of the 35 tracked projects currently do.

Advocates split, politicos say she excelled

Advocates are divided on Sheffield’s record. Some credit her with keeping critical issues in the spotlight, even when legislation stalled.

“She was good at keeping water affordability in the news,” said Sylvia Orduño, a local organizer with the People’s Water Board Coalition. “Making it part of the ‘People’s Bills’ emphasized that water and sanitation is a human right.”

Others were less convinced.

“She ain’t done nothing,” said Tahira Ahmad, a member of the Detroit Coalition for Property Tax Justice, who said she was overtaxed by $30,000 but can’t benefit from the city’s current compensation offerings. “It’s just all about a political game with her.”

Former council member Sheila Cockrel, also unaffiliated in the mayor’s race, said Sheffield brought a rare level of policy focus to her council role.

“I have watched Mary as a member of council and council president approach the position with a clear intellectual policy structure to her work,” Cockrel said, referring to the “People’s Bills.” “She actually had a frame of reference for the work she brought forward — and she named it and moved to execute.”

Both Castañeda-López and Durhal said Sheffield’s high-profile agenda may have invited an unwarranted degree of scrutiny.

“It’s almost like the more you perform, the more that’s demanded of you,” Castañeda-López said. “There’s so much pressure and expectation for you to just know everything and fix everything … until you’re in the role, it’s really hard to understand the inner workings.”

It signals a fundamental reassessment of global manufacturing strategy, elevating American production from cost centre to competitive advantage.","As automotive executives speak cautiously of market volatility and geopolitical uncertainty, Stellantis has made headlines by moving decisively towards a regional production strategy of huge consequence and proportion. The carmaker announced on 14th October 2025 plans to invest $13bn over four years in its US operations, marking the largest single capital commitment in its century-long American history. The investment promises to reshape the company's North American manufacturing footprint - adding five new vehicle programmes, reopening a shuttered Illinois assembly plant, and creating more than 5,000 jobs across four states in the industrial Midwest.

Francesco Ciancia returns to lead Stellantis global production

Stellantis has appointed Francesco Ciancia as Global Head of Manufacturing, reuniting with an executive whose international experience in lean production and transformation will shape its future operations.

The scale of the commitment is remarkable, not merely for its size, but for its timing. Whilst rivals have hedged their manufacturing strategies, dispersing investments across multiple continents, Stellantis has opted for production concentration. The plan targets a 50% increase in annual finished vehicle production capacity, complemented by 19 product refreshes spanning its entire US assembly network through 2029.

This represents a decisive and significant recalibration of the OEM's global manufacturing strategy, elevating US production from a regional priority to a cornerstone of worldwide competitiveness.

""This investment in the US – the single largest in the Company's history – will drive our growth, strengthen our manufacturing footprint and bring more American jobs to the states we call home,"" said Antonio Filosa, Stellantis CEO and North America COO. ""As we begin our next 100 years, we are putting the customer at the center of our strategy, expanding our vehicle offerings and giving them the freedom to choose the products they want and love.""

The investment arrives at a moment of strategic inflection for Stellantis. Having weathered the consolidation that created the company from the merger of Fiat Chrysler and PSA Group, the OEM now confronts questions about its long-term positioning in the world's second-largest automotive market. Mr Filosa's comments suggest an answer rooted in manufacturing presence rather than import dependency.

The anatomy of a $13bn manufacturing pledge

Tariffs, trade shifts, and EV turbulence: How Trump’s second term is reshaping North American auto manufacturing

North American vehicle manufacturing is undergoing major changes. These are in response to political actions, wider market factors and some interesting decisions by major vehicle companies

The financial architecture of Stellantis's commitment extends beyond simple factory investment. The $13bn envelope encompasses research and development expenditure, supplier ecosystem development, and manufacturing infrastructure modernisation. The integrated approach reflects contemporary automotive economics, where vehicle programmes demand coordinated investments across design, engineering, and production systems, hearkening to the enhanced Design for Manufacture (DfM) systems that put Chinese automakers far ahead of their 'Western' contemporaries.

Yet the announcement's true significance lies in its geographic concentration. Rather than dispersing capital across its global network, Stellantis has chosen to concentrate resources in four adjoining states: Illinois, Ohio, Michigan, and Indiana. This clustering strategy promises operational efficiencies through supplier proximity, logistics optimisation, and workforce mobility. It also carries political resonance, concentrating job creation in states that have experienced decades of manufacturing employment decline.

The product portfolio underlying the investment spans multiple segments and powertrain architectures. Five new vehicle programmes will join 19 product refreshes, creating what the company describes as a ""regular cadence"" of launches through 2029. This rhythm of introductions aims to maintain product competitiveness whilst avoiding the feast-or-famine cycle that has plagued automotive manufacturers in previous decades.

""Accelerating growth in the US has been a top priority since my first day. Success in America is not just good for Stellantis in the US — it makes us stronger everywhere,"" Filosa said.

From closure to resurrection at Belvidere, Illinois

Perhaps no element of the investment carries greater symbolic weight than the planned resurrection of the Belvidere Assembly Plant. Stellantis intends to invest more than $600m to reopen the facility, which will expand production of the Jeep Cherokee and Jeep Compass for the American market.

The vehicle producer anticipates the reopening will create approximately 3,300 jobs, with initial production launch expected in 2027. The Belvidere reopening reverses one of the more contentious manufacturing decisions in recent Stellantis history.

The facility's closure had become emblematic of the challenges facing industrial communities in the American Midwest, where automotive employment has contracted sharply over the past two decades. Its revival transforms the plant from a symbol of industrial decline into an anchor of regional economic revitalisation.

The economic calculus supporting Belvidere's resurrection reflects broader shifts in automotive manufacturing. Rising logistics costs, supply chain fragility exposed during pandemic disruptions, and growing political pressure for domestic production have altered the economics of global manufacturing networks. What appeared uneconomical several years ago now presents compelling returns, particularly for vehicles serving primarily domestic markets.

Reconfiguring the Toledo, Ohio production ecosystem for increased flexibility

Ohio emerges as a second major beneficiary of the investment programme. With nearly $400m in capital commitment, Stellantis plans to produce an all-new midsize truck at the Toledo Assembly Complex, where it will share production lines with the Jeep Wrangler and Jeep Gladiator. The programme, originally allocated to Belvidere, could create more than 900 jobs. Production launch is anticipated in 2028.

The flexible assembly line: How vehicle production learned to hedge its bets

Market uncertainty has forced manufacturers to abandon fixed production lines. Honda, BMW and Volkswagen are investing billions in systems that can switch between combustion, hybrid and electric vehicles by the hour.

The Toledo investment illustrates the company's approach to manufacturing flexibility. By consolidating multiple vehicle programmes within single facilities, Stellantis aims to achieve economies of scope whilst maintaining the ability to adjust production volumes in response to market demand. The strategy reflects lessons learned from previous cycles, when dedicated single-product facilities struggled during market downturns.

Beyond the new truck programme, Stellantis confirmed its intention to proceed with previously announced Toledo investments. These include advanced technologies and product enhancements for both the Wrangler and Gladiator, alongside expanded component production at the Toledo Machining Plant. The integrated approach treats the Toledo complex as an ecosystem rather than a collection of discrete facilities.

Michigan's dual-powertrain gambit

Michigan's allocation within the investment programme reflects the industry's technological uncertainty. Stellantis plans to develop an all-new range-extended electric vehicle and internal combustion engine large SUV for production at the Warren Truck Assembly Plant beginning in 2028. The company will invest nearly $100m to retool the facility, with the new programme anticipated to add more than 900 jobs to a plant currently assembling the Jeep Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer.

The dual-powertrain strategy hedges against technological and regulatory uncertainty. By developing both range-extended EV and traditional internal combustion variants simultaneously, Stellantis positions itself to respond to market preferences that remain unclear. The approach acknowledges that whilst regulatory pressure favours electrification, consumer adoption patterns continue to diverge from policy ambitions.

Stellantis also expects to invest $130m preparing the Detroit Assembly Complex at Jefferson for production of the next-generation Dodge Durango, reaffirming a commitment announced in January. Production launch is anticipated in 2029, extending the facility's production timeline and securing employment for its workforce.

Kokomo, Indiana's four-cylinder engine and 'strategic powertrain' play

The investment programme extends beyond vehicle assembly to powertrain manufacturing. Stellantis confirmed plans to make additional investments exceeding $100m across several Kokomo, Indiana facilities to produce the all-new GMET4 EVO four-cylinder engine beginning in 2026. The programme will add more than 100 jobs, ensuring American production of what the company characterises as a 'strategic powertrain'.

The four-cylinder engine investment merits attention for its strategic implications. At a moment when industry discourse emphasises electrification, Stellantis has committed substantial capital to advanced internal combustion technology. The GMET4 EVO designation suggests evolutionary improvements in efficiency and emissions performance, positioning the engine as a bridge technology during the extended transition to electrification.

Read - Analysis: Carmakers face flux with flexible production as labour crisis deepens

Fourth annual survey reveals workforce challenges remain paramount whilst production flexibility emerges as new complexity. Early data suggests fundamental shift in how manufacturers approach capacity and agility in uncertain times.

The decision to locate four-cylinder production in America rather than importing engines from lower-cost manufacturing locations reflects changing economics. Currency fluctuations, logistics costs, and tariff considerations increasingly favour regional manufacturing for regional markets. The Kokomo investment also strengthens the company's bargaining position in future trade negotiations, demonstrating domestic manufacturing commitment.

Stellantis's American footprint now encompasses 34 manufacturing facilities, parts distribution centres, and research and development locations across 14 states. These operations support more than 48,000 employees, 2,600 dealers, and nearly 2,300 suppliers in thousands of communities nationwide. The October announcement builds upon previously announced actions from January 2025, suggesting a sustained commitment to American manufacturing expansion rather than a one-time capital deployment.

The $13bn commitment represents more than financial engineering. It signals a fundamental reassessment of global manufacturing strategy, elevating American production from cost centre to competitive advantage. Whether this wager on the industrial heartland delivers promised returns will determine not merely Stellantis's future in America, but its positioning in the global automotive hierarchy.",https://image.automotivemanufacturingsolutions.com/1584705.jpg?imageId=1584705&x=0&y=12.5&cropw=100&croph=71.67&panox=0&panoy=12.5&panow=100&panoh=71.67&width=1200&height=683,N,,2025-10-15 08:06:08.272862

Instead of doubling down on a full EV push, the company is directing major capital toward internal combustion engines (ICE), hybrid and range-extended powertrains, and flexible platforms that can pivot among multiple energy sources. This strategic pivot has broad implications for the automaker’s financial outlook, the competitive auto industry, and EV stocks.

A New Strategic Direction: Why Stellantis Investment Is Shifting

Since the merger of Fiat Chrysler and PSA, Stellantis has positioned itself as an industry leader in electrification, pledging massive capital toward battery electric vehicles (BEVs). But the latest plan reveals a rethink: only one of five new vehicle programs under the $13B package is described as a range-extended EV, while the rest lean toward ICE, hybrids, and multi-energy architectures.

Stellantis’ CEO Antonio Filosa emphasizes that the strategy is not abandoning electrification, but rather optimizing flexibility. A key driver is the lackluster EV demand across large segments and the increasingly stringent qualification rules for battery tax credits. Many buyers remain hesitant to adopt full BEVs, especially in truck and SUV markets.

By anchoring the $13 billion toward plant reopenings, engine investments, hybrid platforms, and adaptable lines, Stellantis hedges its bets. The approach is pragmatic, giving the company optionality to pivot as regulations, incentives, and consumer tastes evolve.

Where the Money Goes: Breakdown of the $13 B U.S. Investment

The investment is spread across multiple states and product lines. Here’s a regional and program-level view:

Illinois & Midwest (Belvidere, Kokomo, etc.)

Reopening the Belvidere Assembly Plant (Illinois) with over $600 million investment, intended to produce Jeep Cherokee and Compass models domestically, creating ~3,300 jobs.

A new four-cylinder engine (GMET4 EVO) will be built in Kokomo, Indiana, starting in 2026, with over $100 million in investment.

Ohio / Michigan

A new midsize truck program moves to Toledo, Ohio, with a nearly $400 million investment.

Allocation of $130 million in Detroit’s Jefferson plant to produce the next-gen Dodge Durango (ICE or hybrid) by 2029.

The Warren Truck Assembly Plant (Michigan) will be retooled for a range-extended EV and an ICE large SUV by 2028.

R&D, Supplier & Infrastructure

Upgrades to parts suppliers, battery line intersections, and tooling to support both ICE and electrified platforms.

19 product refreshes and new powertrain programs through 2029.

In sum, the portfolio tilts toward hybrid and ICE growth, with electrification playing a supporting yet cautious role.

Impacts on Stock & Auto Market Dynamics

1. Stellantis Investment and Stock Market Signals

Investors and stock research teams are interpreting the pivot with mixed signals. On one hand, the $13B infusion sends a message: Stellantis is doubling down on profitability rather than an EV arms race. But critics argue that the shift could leave the company vulnerable should full electrification accelerate faster than expected.

In after-hours trading, Stellantis shares jumped ~4% following the announcement. Analysts are now reevaluating future earnings growth, free cash flow, and margin assumptions, particularly as the company delays its next strategic update to Q2 2026.

This repositioning places Stellantis somewhere between aggressive EV bets and cautious legacy bets, a middle ground that may attract investors seeking balance in stock market volatility across the auto sector.

2. Competitive Landscape & EV Stocks

Other automakers are also rethinking pure EV trajectories:

General Motors is amplifying its hybrid commitment in North America while extending EV programs.

Ford is pushing hybrid versions of trucks and delaying full BEV domination.

Pure EV plays like Tesla remain benchmarks, yet face scaling and margin pressures.

Stellantis’ flexibility may give it a competitive advantage when EV stock sentiment cycles, especially if supply chain or regulatory risk upend rigid strategies.

3. Risks of Being Too Conservative

The biggest risk? Falling behind in a rapidly electrifying world. If lithium-ion battery costs plunge or charging infrastructure improvement accelerates, those betting heavily on ICE or hybrid could suffer.

Stellantis’ ability to adjust pace will be tested, especially in Europe, where emissions standards and zero-emissions mandates loom. Already, the company backed away from hydrogen vehicle development to focus on EVs and hybrids.

Why Stellantis Is Betting on Flexibility

This $13 billion plan signals a deeper philosophy, not to pick one technology winner, but to stay versatile across energy sources. Several strategic rationales explain this:

Consumer hesitancy: EV adoption still lags in many U.S. markets, especially in trucks and rural areas.

Regulatory ambiguity: Rules around battery credits, emissions, and mandates keep shifting.

Margin stability: ICE and hybrid platforms have mature supply chains and more predictable margins.

Execution risk: Building BEV capacity is capital-intensive and risky; mistakes are costly.

Optionality: If EV demand surges later, Stellantis can scale those projects while still monetizing existing platforms.

Rather than doubling down on a single path, Stellantis’ Stellantis investment strategy is betting that the road ahead is multi-energy, not EV exclusive.

Looking Ahead: What to Watch

Timing of launches: The GMET4 engine in 2026 and new vehicles (2028–2029) will reveal how execution plays out.

EV tax credit eligibility: Changes in battery sourcing rules will influence product viability.

Market response: Consumer adoption curves may validate or penalize this bet.

Regulatory shifts: EU and U.S. mandates toward zero emissions could force faster pivots.

Stock moves in the auto sector: Investor rotation into or out of EV stocks may shift sentiment for Stellantis.

Stellantis is essentially pressing pause on all-in EV urgency, preferring to build a resilient, adjustable platform that can flex with disruption.

Conclusion

Stellantis’ decision to channel its investment emphasis away from pure electric vehicle programs and toward multi-energy, flexible platforms is a bold move. It bets on adaptability over ideology, allowing them to hedge risk and hold options. In doing so, the company may appeal to investors wary of all-electric swings, even as it must guard against falling behind if the EV wave accelerates far beyond projections.

For those tracking AI stocks or market sectors tied to energy transition, Stellantis now presents an interesting case of industrial reinvention rather than disruption. As stock research updates flow in, this $13 billion pivot could become a defining moment in the auto investment narrative.

The progress report, Delivering on the UAE Consensus: Tracking progress toward tripling renewable energy capacity and doubling energy efficiency by 2030 also highlights that energy efficiency is an equally great concern.
While renewable energy investments grew by 7% in 2024, actual disbursements remain far below the levels required to build robust project pipelines and accelerate construction.
As to supply chains, fair and transparent trade practices must be ensured for critical renewable energy technologies and international co-operation pursued to safeguard trade corridors for key materials and components.
Furthermore, strategic investment in modernising and expanding electricity grids is the essential foundation for integrating new capacity and strengthening energy security.","In 2024, global renewable capacity additions reached an unprecedented 582 GW. Yet this is still not enough to stay on track for the COP28 UAE Consensus target of tripling renewables to 11.2 TW by 2030. Meeting that goal now demands a staggering 1 122 GW of added capacity every year from 2025 onward, requiring annual growth to accelerate to 16.6% through the decade, according to the second official tracking report on the landmark energy goals set by the UAE Consensus at COP28.

The progress report, Delivering on the UAE Consensus: Tracking progress toward tripling renewable energy capacity and doubling energy efficiency by 2030 also highlights that energy efficiency is an equally great concern. Global energy intensity improved by just 1% in 2024, far below the 4% annual gains needed to meet the UAE Consensus goal and keep the 1.5°C target alive.

The report calls for urgent action to:

integrate renewable targets into national climate plans (NDC 3.0) ahead of COP30 in Belém;

double collective NDC ambition to align with the global renewables goal; and

scale investment in renewables to at least USD 1.4 trillion per year in 2025–2030 –more than doubling the USD 624 billion invested in 2024.

The world’s major advanced and emerging economies must take the lead, according to the recommendations of the new report. G20 nations are projected to account for over 80% of global renewables by 2030, with the richest developed economies of the G7 expected to shoulder a leadership role by raising their share to around 20% of global capacity within this decade.

Major global economies must also deliver on climate finance, meeting the USD 300 billion annual floor of the new collective quantified goal (NCQG) and scaling up towards the aspirational USD 1.3 trillion confirmed at COP29 in Azerbaijan.

Beyond renewables, the report underlines the urgent need for investment in grids, supply chains, and clean-tech manufacturing for solar, wind, batteries and hydrogen.

While renewable energy investments grew by 7% in 2024, actual disbursements remain far below the levels required to build robust project pipelines and accelerate construction. As to supply chains, fair and transparent trade practices must be ensured for critical renewable energy technologies and international co-operation pursued to safeguard trade corridors for key materials and components.

Furthermore, strategic investment in modernising and expanding electricity grids is the essential foundation for integrating new capacity and strengthening energy security. Between now and 2030, an estimated USD 670 billion must be directed each year towards grids, with further investment required to rapidly scale up energy storage solutions, facilitate renewable integration and safeguard grid stability.

The Trump administration’s bias against clean energy technologies blinds it to economic reality.
The most significant global clean energy investment in 2024 was in solar energy; at $450 billion, that’s double the global investments in coal.
Today, ​​hydro, wind, and solar energy comprise 30 percent of China’s energy generation, with more wind and solar than coal.
These Chinese clean energy investments carry obvious climate benefits.","Until this year, America was set to embark on its largest investments in history toward clean and affordable energy and good-paying jobs. Congress included more than $350 billion in tax credits, appropriated grants and loans for domestic clean energy projects and manufacturing as part of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). In 2021, Congress passed the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL), which also appropriated $60 billion to modernize our nation’s energy infrastructure.

​​​The Trump administration has now tossed that progress out the window.

​​​​​​​During the first days of the government shutdown, the Department of Energy (DOE) announced it would halt almost $8 billion in electrical grid upgrades and new spending on a range of clean energy technologies, from renewables to carbon capture.

DOE is also ​​expected to cut tens of billions more in energy infrastructure projects in the coming weeks. This is in addition to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) cutting the Solar for All ​​program, which would have provided ​​billions of dollars in clean energy investments that help low-income communities reduce energy costs. Instead, it plans to invest millions in our nation’s oldest coal plants as part of President Donald Trump’s efforts to bring back “​​beautiful” coal.

The Trump administration’s efforts are both confounding and counterproductive. Ripping funds away from grid infrastructure, manufacturers, and energy producers will ​​delay reliable cheap energy for millions of Americans suffering from high energy prices and shut the U.S. out of a booming international clean energy market.

Across the country, in both red states and blue states, public and private stakeholders alike have clamored for the clean energy funding appropriated in these bills. When I was a senior official at the ​​Office of Management and Budget (OMB) during President Joe Biden’s administration, ​​we found that most new clean energy IRA and BIL programs were heavily overprescribed. The Trump administration’s rescissions of appropriated and obligated funds are blocking these critical investments just as they are starting to flow into communities.

While the potential climate benefits of the IRA and the BIL have received significant attention, the economic benefits expected to flow from these two laws have too often been buried in the broader climate battle between the political parties. Both laws promoted energy diversification and technology-neutral solutions. Implementing both laws promised lower energy costs, stronger economic growth, and a challenge to China’s dominance over global clean energy supply chains.

For instance, both the IRA and BIL greatly expanded the DOE’s ​​Loan Programs Office, providing billions for loan guarantees to diverse clean technologies such as nuclear, microgrids, and natural gas pipelines. The IRA also created technology-neutral energy tax credits, which, for the first time, would have incentivized investments in emissions reductions rather than in specific technologies. In addition, the IRA created a Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, which authorized regional energy infrastructure banks to leverage private investments in low- and zero-emission energy technologies for capital-starved communities.

Even technology-targeted efforts were focused on quickly bringing clean, cheap energy to market and giving U.S. manufacturers a leg-up in global markets. The IRA’s new EPA Solar for All program, for instance, provided​​ funds for states, Tribal governments, and local jurisdictions to support low-income solar projects, while the BIL’s Hydrogen Hubs created new economic development centers in clean hydrogen across the country.

The Trump administration’s bias against clean energy technologies blinds it to economic reality. In a recent ​​interview with Breitbart, Department of Energy Secretary Chris Wright called investments in renewable energy, transmission line expansions, and battery technologies one of the “greatest malinvestments” in human history. Yet, global investments in these technologies are booming. According to ​​​​International Energy Agency (IEA)’s World Energy Investment report, approximately $2.2 trillion in global investments went toward renewables, nuclear, transmission, storage, low-emissions fuels, efficiency, and electrification. That​​ is a trillion dollars more than a decade ago and a trillion more than the year’s combined oil, gas, and coal investments. The most significant global clean energy investment in 2024 was in solar energy; at $450 billion, that’s double the global investments in coal.

The largest global investor in both coal and solar is China. Republicans often point to Beijing’s plan to add 94.5 gigawatts of new coal capacity to justify doubling down on coal. But China’s coal investments are part of a broader strategy focused on diversification, stability, and economic opportunity. China has limited domestic natural gas resources, and ​its ​nuclear capacity is about 40 percent lower than U.S. generation. Along with population pressures, global markets, and political volatility in coal-rich Xinjiang, all of these factors shape China’s choices.

There is still time for Congress and the administration to reverse course, but every day leaves the U.S. further behind. Unlike the Trump administration, China invests in all energy sources while modernizing its energy system. In addition to adding nuclear and coal generation capacity, China is making historic investments in wind, solar, battery storage, grid modernization, and electrification. According to a ​​2025 report by the International Society for Energy Transition Studies and Ember ​​​​​Energy Research (​EMBER), China spent $625 billion on clean energy in 2024 and more than ​​doubled its wind and solar generation capacity over three years to 1,408 gigawatts. Today, ​​hydro, wind, and solar energy comprise 30 percent of China’s energy generation, with more wind and solar than coal. The same ISETS/EMBER report found that China also tripled its energy storage capacity over the past three years, commissioning more battery storage in 2024 than the U.S. and Europe combined. It also ​​invested the equivalent of ​​$600 billion in grid modernization and electrification in 2024 alone.

These Chinese clean energy investments carry obvious climate benefits. President Xi Jinping recently announced that China would cut peak greenhouse gas emissions by up to 10 percent in the next decade. That is despite Beijing’s ongoing coal investments, and at a time when most countries fail to meet their greenhouse gas emission targets. State support and larger production scale help Chinese manufacturers reduce costs, cut domestic energy prices, and strengthen their competitive advantage overseas.

According to the Climate Leadership Council’s analysis of data from a 2024 IEA Energy Technology Perspectives report, Chinese exports of clean energy technologies to emerging markets increased 125 percent over three years, reaching $96 billion by 2023. In comparison, U.S. exports only reached $10 billion. Chinese global dominance is moreover growing, with China’s clean energy exports projected to surpass $340 billion by 2035—on par with 2024 oil export revenues generated by Saudi Arabia and the UAE combined.

Every dollar withheld from modernizing our energy system is a gift to our economic rivals. Shelving Biden-era investments delays much-needed, cheap energy for American households and businesses. It’s time for Congress to intervene. Doing so will reassert U.S. leadership and grow our economy.",https://i0.wp.com/washingtonmonthly.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AP25237567887218-scaled.jpg?fit=2560%2C1920&quality=89&ssl=1,N,,2025-10-15 05:58:49.532671

Yet despite these natural advantages, high production costs, scarce affordable financing, limited government support, and weak industrial policies continue to constrain the continent’s manufacturing ambitions.
Emerging projects like South Africa’s 300-megawatt Seraphim solar panel manufacturing plant suggest that African countries may yet capture a foothold in the solar manufacturing value chain.
Instead, he suggested, African economies could focus on assembly or specialized products that complement Chinese manufacturing.
The answer will determine how — and how much — the continent can benefit from the solar manufacturing value chain in the years ahead.","China’s manufacturing dominance remains tightly bound to Africa’s struggle for energy access. The continent holds the raw materials essential for producing renewable energy technologies, yet its factories lack the scale and efficiency to compete with China’s vast industrial base.

As a result, African nations remain reliant on Chinese-made equipment even as they seek to climb the manufacturing value chain.

WiSolar, a solar energy firm operating in South Africa and Nigeria, illustrates this dynamic. Founded in 2016 as an inverter Original Equipment Manufacturer, the company eventually shifted its production to China, citing the prohibitive costs of manufacturing locally and the competitive advantages of China’s industrial ecosystem.

Tin, Copper, And Silicon Reserves For Solar Panel Production

Tonye Irims, WiSolar’s founder and chief executive, points out that Africa’s solar potential is vast, underpinned by its abundant reserves of tin, copper, and silicon, essential materials for solar panel production. Yet despite these natural advantages, high production costs, scarce affordable financing, limited government support, and weak industrial policies continue to constrain the continent’s manufacturing ambitions.

Emerging projects like South Africa’s 300-megawatt Seraphim solar panel manufacturing plant suggest that African countries may yet capture a foothold in the solar manufacturing value chain. Seraphim, officially known as Jiangsu Seraphim Solar System Co., Ltd., produces both rooftop solar modules and the photovoltaic cells that power them, with some units made in South Africa sold as far away as the United States.

Still, the goal need not be to build industries that compete head-on with China. “If you talk to these Chinese manufacturers, you know it’s very cost-effective to produce in China,” said Yixian Sun, an associate professor of international development at the University of Bath. “But if they see benefits in investing locally — if host governments offer incentives and stable policies — there’s a strong incentive to explore new manufacturing markets.”

Small Solar Panels Tailored to Household Use

Given the complexity of producing solar panels from raw materials to finished products, Dr. Sun added, it remains unrealistic for countries with limited industrial bases to start from scratch. Instead, he suggested, African economies could focus on assembly or specialized products that complement Chinese manufacturing. “Maybe we can do some assemblage that helps Chinese manufacturers lower export costs, while creating local jobs and encouraging governments to offer tax incentives,” he said.

Such arrangements could also open space for local innovation. In Pakistan, for instance, small solar panels tailored to household use are made domestically because they are too low-margin for Chinese firms to produce efficiently. “Similarly, different African countries may find niches to specialize in, while Chinese companies can offer technology and expertise,” Dr. Sun noted.

Resources, Incentives and Policies to Sustain Industrial Development

Muyi Yang, a senior energy analyst at the global think tank, Ember, agreed that a few regional manufacturing hubs may eventually serve the entire continent. “There isn’t a single country that has a completely clean-energy equipment supply chain,” he said. “Africa will likely see a few hubs emerge to provide equipment and facilities across borders. That’s a more realistic scenario.”

Even in cases where manufacturing is unfeasible, Yang said, countries can still gain valuable know-how. “There will be technological spillover, because you need local staff for installation, operation, and maintenance,” he said. Some equipment — such as large solar floaters — may even be cheaper to produce locally because of high shipping costs. “That creates demand for complementary industries to grow,” he added.

Ultimately, the question for African policymakers is whether they have the resources, incentives, and coherent policies to sustain industrial development. The answer will determine how — and how much — the continent can benefit from the solar manufacturing value chain in the years ahead.",https://chinaglobalsouth.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AFP__20250220__cfoto-chinapvm250220_npUVX__v1__HighRes__ChinaPvManufacturingIndustry-768x448.jpg,N,,2025-10-15 11:03:25.827792

For recipients based in New York state, 20 awards were still active when the Trump administration announced the cuts.
The utility has to file a long-term gas plan as a result of a dispute with former governor Andrew Cuomo.
In the end, National Grid agreed to periodically file a long-term gas plan for review by the state’s Public Service Commission, which regulates utility rates.
“Let’s build more energy infrastructure to drive down the cost of energy here in New York state, across New England and across our country.” Whether the Climate Act drives the state’s high energy prices remains a subject of debate.","During a recent visit to a Long Island power station, U.S. Department of Energy Secretary Chris Wright criticized Biden-era policies that supported the development of renewable energy sources.

“There was a lot of that money allocated under the Biden administration that was to encourage business and utilities to … spend money to make electricity more expensive and less reliable,” Wright said during a press conference.

The next day, the Trump Administration announced the termination of 321 awards, claiming $7.5 billion in cuts for clean energy projects. Inside Climate News recently reported that many of these awards were already past their end date.

Empire Clean Cities, which promotes the advancement of alternative fuels and alternative-fuel vehicles to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, was among the organizations that had its funds cut.

The Manhattan-based nonprofit will lose more than 90 percent of the funds for its $1.7 million award. So far, Empire Clean Cities had received only $162,631 of its award for a project designed to reduce emissions in Hunts Point in the Bronx, according to federal spending data. Largely due to truck traffic, this neighborhood has an annual child asthma hospitalization rate double the citywide average.

“It’s where folks live and work, and so they see every day the impact of truck traffic emissions on their air quality, on their health,” said Joy Gardner, the executive director of Empire Clean Cities. “This was a real opportunity to make a drastic change in just the general quality of life.”

Hunts Point attracts a high volume of freight traffic partly due to its proximity to food centers, including the Hunts Point Food Distribution Center. The city estimates that the center distributes around 4.5 billion pounds of food every year.

Empire Clean Cities is on the cusp of publishing an electrification plan for Hunts Point, with engagement from local businesses, communities and city agencies. The plan would offer a pathway to electrification for vehicles operating in the neighborhood—and subsequently help alleviate the health issues many residents face.

Though Gardner said the plan is likely to still be published, other aspects of the plan could be delayed or may not happen at all. The nonprofit planned to install six fast-charging electric ports in the neighborhoods, for personal and freight vehicles, according to Gardner.

Empire Clean Cities also planned to provide technical assistance to businesses looking to electrify their truck fleets and information sessions for community members who might want to buy an electric vehicle. According to federal spending data, the nonprofit would “undertake an extensive suite of community outreach activities designed to break down the knowledge barriers preventing [electric vehicle] adoption in the neighborhood.”

“It’s really disappointing not to be able to take this over the finish line, especially with just a year left on the grant,” said Gardner. “We would have been able to do a tremendous amount with that.”

In a statement about the grant cancellations, New York Governor Kathy Hochul said “These cuts directly impact local businesses and major companies, putting workers out of jobs, shuttering factories, and slowing our state’s economic progress.”

In response to questions from Inside Climate News, Ken Lovett, Hochul’s senior communications advisor on energy and environment, wrote that the announcement “came as no surprise given the Trump administration’s full-on assault on clean energy.”

The Trump Administration announced the termination of 321 grants on October 2. An Inside Climate News analysis of federal government spending data for the awards found that only 188 were still active, according to their stated end dates, at the end of September.

Once ICN subtracted money already sent to recipients from the sums obligated to be spent, we calculated a total of $4.87 billion in cuts, roughly two-thirds of the dollar amount announced by the Department of Energy.

For recipients based in New York state, 20 awards were still active when the Trump administration announced the cuts. After accounting for the money already distributed, the state lost out on about $146 million.

But for Hochul, the grant cuts seem to be just the latest setback to her plans to deliver on the state’s lofty climate goals and address energy concerns. She has recently admitted that New York is unlikely to meet its climate targets, drawing the ire of many residents.

Hochul says she remains committed to reducing emissions in the state and has invested considerable funds toward that goal. She recently allocated $1 billion to clean energy projects and emission-reduction efforts and has directed the state-owned utility, the New York Power Authority, to build at least one new nuclear plant by 2040.

Hochul’s Predicament

At a Brooklyn church in early September, the advocacy group Public Power NY hosted a People’s Hearing for Public Renewables, where officials, environmentalists and a few dozen New York residents discussed the state’s renewable energy plans and expressed disappointment with Hochul’s progress.

“We have a movement behind us that is fighting for something better,” said state senator Jabari Brisport, who represents a district in Brooklyn. “We have a governor who wants to drag her feet.”

New York’s Climate Act requires the state to achieve a 40 percent reduction from 1990 levels in economy-wide greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and an 85 percent reduction by 2050. The act also requires that 70 percent of the state’s electricity come from renewable sources by 2030.

Residents were advocating for the New York Power Authority to build 15 gigawatts of renewable energy by 2030, which they view as necessary to meet the state’s goal of net-zero emissions from the electricity grid by 2040. Currently, the utility plans to build 7 gigawatts of renewable energy, despite state law requiring it to fill all gaps in electricity generation left by the private sector.

“Hurricane Ida completely destroyed my district,” said former Democratic U.S. Rep. Jamaal Bowman, whose district included White Plains and Yonkers. “We need a governor with human-centered leadership… and if not, we need a new governor.”

Much of the focus on achieving these climate goals has been on electrifying building heating and cooling with heat pumps and moving away from gas systems. In 2023, the state passed the All-Electric Building Act, which mandated that most buildings use electric appliances, and the all-electric standard was written into the state building code in July.

The legislation effectively requires most new buildings to be completely electric—so no gas heating or cooking. A similar law was passed in New York City in 2021.

At a recent press conference, Wright, the federal energy secretary, alluded to the “many productive dialogues” he has had with the governor, and said that two proposed gas pipelines, which would pass through the state and which state officials have rejected in the past, were “already planned” and would “lower the cost of heating.”

There has been speculation, fueled by a May post on X by Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum, that Hochul “would move forward on critical pipeline capacity.” The implication was that this was a trade-off for allowing the Empire Wind offshore wind project south of Long Island in the Atlantic Ocean to proceed after the administration halted construction.

Within a month, two previously rejected gas pipelines—the Constitution pipeline and the Northeast Supply Enhancement pipeline, or NESE—entered the regulatory process once again. Hochul has denied that she has made a deal with the White House, but the Trump Administration has said that she “caved” and agreed to allow the pipeline construction, according to Politico’s E&E News.

The Constitution pipeline, which the state rejected in 2016, would run from Pennsylvania’s Marcellus shale fracking sites to upstate New York. The NESE pipeline would extend an existing pipeline, building off the coast of New Jersey and Staten Island to eventually connect with existing pipes in Queens, and add gas infrastructure to Pennsylvania. The state has rejected it three times.

In July, National Grid, the gas utility that serves Staten Island, Long Island and parts of Brooklyn and Queens, added the NESE pipeline to its long-term gas plan as an addendum.

The utility has to file a long-term gas plan as a result of a dispute with former governor Andrew Cuomo. The heart of the 2019 dispute was, ironically, an earlier proposal for the NESE pipeline, which the Department of Environmental Conservation had rejected due to its potential impacts on water quality.

The rejection led to a standoff between the utility and state officials, with National Grid refusing to connect customers to gas lines. The dispute only ended because Cuomo threatened to suspend the utility’s license to operate in the state. In the end, National Grid agreed to periodically file a long-term gas plan for review by the state’s Public Service Commission, which regulates utility rates.

The NESE Pipeline Resurfaces

While reviewing the utility’s plan for the future last month, members of the Public Service Commission found that the NESE project would help the state meet the energy needs of its residents and businesses, particularly in the wake of Winter Storm Elliott in 2022. A report by the Federal Energy Regulator Commission found that some areas of New York were at extreme risk of experiencing gas shutoffs at one point during the storm.

But many New Yorkers were dismayed by the commission’s choice, which has no regulatory authority over the pipeline, but which many believe could signal to the Department of Environmental Conservation that the pipeline is necessary and that it should approve its water permit.

“We are in a week-by-week, hour-by-hour, fight to hold [Hochul] off and keep her from approving this thing,” said Pete Sikora, the climate and inequality campaigns director with New York Communities for Change, about the fight to stop the NESE pipeline.

Several public officials, including Staten Island Borough President Vito Fossella and U.S. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, spoke out against the pipeline, as did the city of New York. Water quality concerns and fears of substantial rate increases abound.

“The governor is willing to put the law off to the side in order to appease fossil fuel interests, big private business interests… and for New York families to foot the bill for that,” said Kim Fraczek, the executive director of Sane Energy, a nonprofit organization that is advocating for the replacement of gas infrastructure with renewable energy. “Our costs will only increase, and that’s for ratepayers and for businesses.”

A report by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, an energy research think tank, estimated that the pipeline would cost $1.25 billion—almost $200 million more than what National Grid had said—due to construction inflation. Even if National Grid’s figures are correct, ratepayers would suffer a substantial monthly increase.

National Grid has predicted that the pipeline will cost ratepayers an additional $7.50 per month if approved. But it has also argued that the pipeline could help lower electricity bills by reducing the price of natural gas, which powers many of the state’s electricity plants.

Hochul is also experiencing pressure from the other side of the aisle. Secretary Chris Wright recently criticized the state’s Climate Act, which requires the state to have a net-zero emissions electricity grid by 2040, calling it “totally nuts.”

“The longer and more aggressively [net-zero] is pursued, the more you elevate your energy prices and impoverish your citizens,” Wright told journalists at the press conference in Long Island earlier this month. “Let’s build more energy infrastructure to drive down the cost of energy here in New York state, across New England and across our country.”

Whether the Climate Act drives the state’s high energy prices remains a subject of debate. A recent Public Service Commission report found that cost recovery for Climate Act measures accounted for anywhere from 5 to 9.5 percent of a residential customer’s monthly electric bill—but consistently 2 percent or less of their gas bill—in 2024.

Another factor contributing to higher rates has been large-scale improvements in gas infrastructure. Last year, residents in downstate New York experienced rate hikes when National Grid began a $5 billion system upgrade, which included replacing “leak-prone” pipes across the region.",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2200914586.jpg,N,,2025-10-15 05:59:11.623634

The Township’s first transit electrification project includes four electric buses, five fast chargers and an intelligent charging management system with remote monitoring.

“Through thoughtful fiscal planning, inter-governmental cooperation and working with EV experts, the Township of Schaumburg is able to keep older adults and people with disabilities independent,” while also reducing the vehicles’ environmental impact, Township Supervisor Timothy Heneghan said in a statement.

Dive Insight:

Electric transit and paratransit fleets have grown in recent years, aided by federal funding for low- or zero-emission transit buses. Such funding through the Federal Transit Administration’s Buses and Bus Facilities and Low or No Emission Bus competitive grant programs has continued under the Trump administration, with a $1.5 billion funding round in May.

The New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority launched a pilot program last year, adding 15 electric vans to its paratransit fleet. The San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency plans to transition its paratransit fleet to be all-electric over 20 years and Pace Suburban Bus, which serves the Chicago region, debuted its first electric paratransit vehicle last year.

But Red Tractor called the watchdog's decision ""fundamentally flawed"" and argued that the scheme's focus was animal welfare not environmental standards.
It said that Red Tractor had failed to provide ""sufficient evidence"" that its farms met ""basic"" environmental laws and had a good environmental outcome to substantiate the claims in the ad.
Jim Mosley, CEO of Red Tractor, told the BBC: ""They believe that we have implied an environmental claim.
When asked if that meant Red Tractor does not know if its farms are complying with environmental law, he said: ""Correct"".","A TV advert by Red Tractor, the UK's biggest certifier of farm products on supermarket shelves, has been banned for exaggerating the scheme's environmental benefits and misleading the public.

The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) ruled the organisation had provided ""insufficient evidence"" that its farms complied with basic environmental laws to substantiate the claims in its ad.

Environmental group River Action, which brought the complaint in 2023, said the ruling showed the scheme was ""greenwashing"" and urged supermarkets to stop using it.

But Red Tractor called the watchdog's decision ""fundamentally flawed"" and argued that the scheme's focus was animal welfare not environmental standards.

The environmental charity River Action took issue with the ad, which ran for a further two years, and complained to the watchdog that it suggested to consumers that Red Tractor farms will ""ensure a high degree of environmental protection"".

The charity pointed to a report by the Environment Agency, released in 2020, which looked at how many breaches of environmental law there were on Red Tractor farms in the previous five years. The report concluded that these farms were ""not currently an indicator of good environmental performance"".

After more than two years of investigation - one of the longest running - the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) upheld the complaint.

It said that Red Tractor had failed to provide ""sufficient evidence"" that its farms met ""basic"" environmental laws and had a good environmental outcome to substantiate the claims in the ad.

It also ruled that as a result the advert was ""misleading"" and ""exaggerated"" the benefits of the scheme.

River Action welcomed the decision by the ASA and called on supermarkets to act.

""What this shows is that for their environmental credentials Red Tractor has been misleading the public and their suppliers,"" said Amy Fairman, head of campaigns at River Action. ""So, we're looking for suppliers like supermarkets to really examine and take stock of what is on their shelves.""

She added that challenging such adverts was important because of the risk to the environment from agricultural pollution.

In 2022, the Environment Audit Committee concluded that agriculture was one of the most common factors preventing rivers from being in good health - affecting 40% of them. The risks to the environment include from slurry and pesticide runoff.

But Red Tractor, which assures 45,000 farms in the UK, have pushed back strongly, calling the finding by the ASA ""fundamentally flawed"".

Jim Mosley, CEO of Red Tractor, told the BBC: ""They believe that we have implied an environmental claim. Nowhere in the voiceover or the imagery is any environmental claim actually made.""

He argued that the ASA only found a minority of people would think the advert meant Red Tractor farms had good environmental standards, and in fact the scheme is focused on other issues.

This funding will lead to the creation and manufacturing of five new models by 2029, with upgrades to plants in Illinois, Ohio, Michigan, and Indiana. The initiative also includes launching a new four-cylinder engine and reopening the Belvidere Assembly Plant in Illinois, enabling increased output of the Jeep Cherokee and Jeep Compass for American consumers. Altogether, the plan is expected to generate over 5,000 new jobs.

In contrast to earlier multibillion-dollar commitments, this investment is not centered on electric vehicles.

Among the five upcoming vehicles, one will be a range-extended electric model — combining a battery with a gasoline generator for longer driving range — set to be built at the Warren Truck Assembly Plant in Michigan starting in 2028. Stellantis also intends to manufacture a large, new gasoline-powered SUV at the same facility.

Other planned products include the next-generation Dodge Durango, which will be assembled at the Detroit Assembly Complex in 2029; a new midsize pickup truck to be produced at the Toledo Assembly Complex in Ohio; and a brand-new four-cylinder engine, the GMET4 EVO, scheduled for production at the Kokomo, Indiana, plant beginning in 2026.

Antonio Filosa, Stellantis CEO and North America COO, stated that this investment will fuel the company’s expansion, reinforce its manufacturing presence, and “create more American jobs in the communities we serve.”

“Driving growth in the U.S. has been my top focus from day one. Achieving success in America not only benefits Stellantis here but also strengthens our global position,” Filosa commented in a press release.

Over the past year, Stellantis has reduced its electrification ambitions for the U.S. market. In September, the company announced it would drop plans for an electrified Gladiator from the Jeep lineup as it reevaluated its product direction.

It is time for insurance companies to become part of the solution rather than part of the problem.
As we foresee a new cycle of neighborhood decline driven by bluelining, we must apply time-proven policy tools to insurance companies.","Escalating climate risks and natural disasters, as well as insurance companies’ opportunism, are causing upheaval in the homeowners’ insurance market, leading to a crisis in availability and affordability, and a new wave of exclusion called “bluelining.” That’s when financial institutions like banks, credit facilities, and insurance companies steeply increase prices or withdraw services from communities that have high levels of environmental risk.

Unlike historical redlining, where lenders denied financial services to people who lived in predominately Black neighborhoods, the geographic exclusion of bluelining is not directly based on race. However, bluelining is often happening in the footprints of redlining. If left unchecked, it could replicate old patterns of disinvestment and decline in communities that already are most socially vulnerable and have limited resources to cope with ever-increasing disasters like fires, flooding, and other extreme weather.

At the Consumer Federation of America and The Greenlining Institute, we have worked for decades to improve oversight of financial institutions like insurance companies, and mitigate the harms caused by redlining. We are sounding the alarm on this new frontier of climate-driven financial exclusion and offering a few policy tools to better respond to it.

The Emergence of Bluelining

People who live in formerly redlined neighborhoods are disproportionately Black and Hispanic. Because of decades-long inequitable access to capital and resources, many redlined communities also have an older, more vulnerable housing stock, and greater exposure to environmental and natural disaster risk. These formerly redlined neighborhoods face higher climate risk due to proximity to hazardous industrial sites, less tree canopy, and an overall underinvestment from both public and private actors in resilient infrastructure, leaving them especially vulnerable to climate-driven financial discrimination.

As a result, bluelining has the potential to exacerbate disinvestment. It leaves communities that have long been denied adequate investment—communities that are now bearing the brunt of climate impacts—without the financial resources to withstand and recover from storms and other weather-related events.

Insurance companies are at the forefront of bluelining today, effectively making determinations about which communities remain insurable and have a future and which communities will not. Without insurance, it is impossible to get a mortgage, and when people can’t get mortgages, the value of homes in that neighborhood plummet.

But bluelining also has implications beyond the availability of property insurance. When insurance coverage is insufficient, mortgage lenders and securitizers—notably Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac, which hold the credit risk of most U.S. mortgages—are exposed. And while insurance companies may be the first to begin withdrawing from climate-vulnerable areas, other financial institutions are starting to follow in deciding where to originate a mortgage or loan, and at what price.

This risk is finally being recognized at the highest levels. In February, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell testified in front of the Senate banking committee in reference to high-risk communities. “If you fast forward 10 or 15 years, there are going to be regions of the country where you can’t get a mortgage. There won’t be ATMs. You know, the banks won’t have branches and things like that,” Powell said.

As insurance companies and lenders increasingly factor climate risk into their business strategies, communities may witness a resurgence of racial and economic exclusion that mimics redlining practices. And as this financial and climate ripple effect intensifies, we may see a new cycle of neighborhood decline.

How Bluelining Will Shape Neighborhood Decline

Bluelining not only makes it hard for individual households to get insurance; it affects entire communities. In the highest-risk communities with the most expensive insurance premiums and lowest level of insurance availability, more and more homeowners are going underinsured and uninsured. An analysis of 2021 American Housing Survey data from the US Census Bureau shows that 1 in 13 homeowners in the United States are uninsured. Homeowners of color are disproportionately at risk.

Those without insurance are at risk of losing their homes and possessions in just one storm or disaster. Over time, this means that neighborhoods with many uninsured homes will have more vacant housing or housing in disrepair. The lessons from depopulated cities show us thatthis vacancy often leads to a downward spiral in surrounding property value and undermines the local tax base. As a 1968 Congressional report concluded, “Communities without insurance are communities without hope.”

When companies blueline communities and restrict access to insurance and mortgages, more residents and businesses may be forced to leave, accelerating a cycle of depopulation. While the last century saw suburbanization, this one may be defined by climate migration, as people flee vulnerable areas for safer ground. Amid this mass exit, the families left behind will be those with the fewest financial resources to move. They’ll be forced to live with crumbling infrastructure and dwindling support.

Without proactive, equitable climate and insurance policy, these trends could mirror and extend the legacies of redlining—deepening racial and economic disparities.

Fighting Back

If these trends become the norm, the challenges of housing disinvestment, shrinking tax bases, and unavailability of financial services are likely to reemerge in climate-impacted places. To prevent this, policymakers must ensure that communities, especially historically marginalized communities, are not left without protection, resources, or a voice in shaping their futures.

As history risks repeating itself, we can start to meet this moment by retooling policies first developed in response to redlining and apply them to the insurance industry.

First, insurance companies should be required to annually disclose their pricing, underwriting, denials, and claim payouts in every census tract, akin to what the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act requires financial institutions to do. There is a severe lack of publicly available data on insurance access and pricing. While laudable efforts in the recent past by the Federal Insurance Office and the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee have aimed to close this gap, they have not led to consistent and robust transparency into property insurance.

By contrast, to prevent redlining, since 1975 mortgage lenders have been required to annually disclose data on every mortgage application they receive. This has provided critical transparency and accountability of the mortgage industry and allowed regulators and the public to detect potential discrimination before it takes hold. As homeowners’ insurance increasingly determines who can own a home and where, insurers should be required to report homeowners’ insurance data in the same manner as mortgage lenders. Such transparency can help prevent unfair discrimination in pricing and access, both between different communities and within communities, where it is targeted at the most vulnerable homeowners. State insurance commissioners should work alongside the Federal Insurance Office to enforce and coordinate this data collection and distribution.

Second, lawmakers should pass state-level community reinvestment acts to require insurance companies to invest in climate risk reduction and resiliency. Examples like California’s Organized Investment Network and the 25-year-old Massachusetts Insurance Company Community Investment Initiative offer voluntary frameworks for directing insurer investments into environmental, housing, and other underfunded needs.

States should launch these kinds of initiatives to ensure that insurance companies become partners in reducing risk and safeguarding communities, rather than only being in the business of profiting from risk. Indeed, insurance companies have extensive investment portfolios, which are a key contributor to their financial bottom line, but many of their investments are exacerbating climate change and driving up costs for communities and homeowners. It is time for insurance companies to become part of the solution rather than part of the problem. With appropriate oversight, state-level community reinvestment acts can drive much-needed investment dollars into resilient communities and housing, while helping lower overall risk and ultimately, the premiums homeowners must pay.

As we foresee a new cycle of neighborhood decline driven by bluelining, we must apply time-proven policy tools to insurance companies. Insurance companies must be held accountable to where and with whom they do business—their decisions increasingly drive the future of homeowners and communities—and must also become investment partners in risk reduction. To prevent bluelining, transparency and investment are critical first steps.",https://shelterforce.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Insurance-Map.jpg,N,,2025-10-15 07:02:21.257544

“The transition to electric vehicles is not only an environmental agenda, but also one of economic independence for the nation.","Jakarta – The transition to electric vehicles (EVs) is increasingly seen as the golden key for Indonesia in realising a green economy. Not only does it have the potential to reduce carbon emissions, but the electrification of transportation is also believed to create hundreds of thousands of new jobs and ease the burden of national energy subsidies.

This issue was raised during the thematic session “Maximising the Economic and Social Benefits of the Electric Vehicle Transition” at the Indonesia International Sustainability Forum (IISF) 2025 on Saturday, October 11. The forum highlighted that the transition to electric vehicles is not merely a matter of technology, but also an interconnected economic, social, and fiscal strategy.

“Transportation electrification is the path to an efficient, independent, and low-emission energy system. Its impact is not only on reducing pollution, but also on fiscal efficiency through savings in fuel subsidies and the creation of green jobs,” said Ahmad Faisal Suralaga, Director of Downstream Strategy and Governance at the Ministry of Investment/BKPM.

Promote fiscal reform and energy efficiency

According to Faisal, downstreaming in the electric vehicle sector is now seen not only as an increase in export value but also as a creator of a sustainable industrial ecosystem. To date, more than 10,000 workers have been absorbed by ongoing downstreaming projects.

Meanwhile, Head of the Center for Industry, Trade, and Investment at INDEF, Andry Satrio Nugroho, believes that fiscal policy plays a vital role in accelerating the adoption of electric vehicles. One instrument that is considered adequate is the application of emission taxes, which can cover up to 111 per cent of potential state revenue losses due to EV incentives.

“With the emissions tax scheme, high-pollution vehicles are subject to disincentives, while low-emission vehicles are not burdened. This is not only fair, but also fiscally efficient,” said Andry.

INDEF analysis notes that the burden of energy subsidies and compensation for fossil fuel vehicles reaches Rp308 trillion per year, which is far greater than the potential loss of state revenue from electric vehicle incentives, estimated at only around Rp14.7 trillion.

Deputy Coordinator of the Secretariat for the National Energy Downstreaming and Security Acceleration Task Force, Dimas Muhamad, said that the success of the EV transition must rely on human innovation, not solely on natural resources.

A similar view was expressed by Gonggomtua Sitanggang, Director of the Southeast Asia Institute for Transportation and Development Policy (ITDP), who emphasised the economic benefits of electrifying public transportation.

According to him, the use of electric buses can save up to 30 per cent in operational costs, reduce residents’ mobility costs, and expand the reach of transportation services. “The ITDP study shows that the benefit-cost ratio (BCR) of public transportation electrification in Jakarta can reach 2.4. This means that every Rp1 invested generates Rp2.4 in economic and social benefits,” said Gonggomtua.

From an industry perspective, R Hanggoro Ananta from the Indonesian Electric Motorcycle Industry Association (AISMOLI) said that the transition to EVs will open up significant job opportunities in the manufacturing, conversion, and technology research sectors. Currently, AISMOLI oversees 57 member companies that are active in various lines of the electric vehicle industry. With the increasing adoption of EVs nationally, this sector is projected to create more than 150,000 new jobs by 2030.

“The transition to electric vehicles is not only an environmental agenda, but also one of economic independence for the nation. This is an opportunity to produce thousands of technicians and green workers who are ready to face the era of sustainable industry,” said Hanggoro. (Hartatik)

Stellantis also plans to invest $130 million to prepare the Detroit Assembly Complex – Jefferson plant for production of the next-generation Dodge Durango, reaffirming a commitment from January. Production of that vehicle is anticipated to launch in 2029. The UAW previously had expressed concern that Durango production would leave the U.S.

“This investment in the U.S. — the single largest in the Company’s history — will drive our growth, strengthen our manufacturing footprint and bring more American jobs to the states we call home,” Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa said in a statement. “As we begin our next 100 years, we are putting the customer at the center of our strategy, expanding our vehicle offerings and giving them the freedom to choose the products they want and love.”

Stellantis said it plans to reopen an Illinois assembly plant in in 2027, affirming an earlier commitment to do so. But instead of building a midsize Ram pickup, the plant, which has been offline since 2023, will make the Jeep Compass and Cherokee that were slated to be built outside the U.S.

The Ram pickup now will be assembled in Toledo, Ohio, starting in 2028.

“A year ago, Stellantis was on a fast-track to moving their U.S. operations out of the country,” UAW President Shawn Fain said in a statement. “Their decision today proves that targeted auto tariffs can, in fact, bring back thousands of good union jobs to the U.S. Wall Street and supposed industry experts said this was impossible. But race to the bottom created by free trade is finally coming to an end.”

Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said in a statement celebrating the Michigan investment, ""Over the last few years, Stellantis has expanded in Michigan, and we will continue working with them to make it easier to manufacture in Michigan by investing in workforce development, cutting red tape, incentivizing R&D, and increasing government efficiency.""

The news follows General Motors’ commitment in June to spend $4 billion to increase U.S. manufacturing.

Stellantis’ $13 billion total includes R&D spending and supplier costs. After Filosa became CEO in June, he set a “clear priority” for his team to grow the company in the U.S., where sales and profits had been declining.

“The only way we know to consistently grow in such a competitive market is to launch the right product with the right brands, the right tech and the right powertrain,” Filosa said. “So how we do that? First, we decided to put our customer at the center of everything we do. We actually started listening to him and her and to engage a lot our dealers. That’s how we came out with our growing plan.”

The product launches announced Oct. 14 “will be in addition to a regular cadence of 19 refreshed products across all U.S. assembly plants and updated powertrains planned through 2029,” Stellantis said.

The company plans to invest $600 million to reopen the Belvidere Assembly Plant in Illinois to produce the Cherokee and Compass for the U.S., with one nameplate starting in 2027 and the other in 2028. This will create about 3,300 new jobs.

Both nameplates were previously made in Belvidere, with the Compass moving to Mexico in 2016 and the Cherokee being discontinued when the plant was idled in 2023.

Jeep is reviving the Cherokee this fall as a hybrid built in Mexico.

When Belvidere reopens, Filosa said it will be the primary source of Cherokees and Compasses for the U.S. Stellantis no longer plans to make the redesigned Compass in Brampton, Ontario, after halting work to retool the Canadian plant in February.

“As part of this announcement, we will move one model from Canada to the U.S.,” a Stellantis spokesperson said. “We have been in Canada for over 100 years, and we are investing there. We are adding a third shift to the Windsor Assembly Plant to support increased demand of all versions of the Chrysler Pacifica and the new Sixpack-powered Dodge Charger Scat Pack and R/T models. Canada is very important to us. We have plans for Brampton and will share them upon further discussions with the Canadian government.”

The move upset the Canadian auto union Unifor, which urged the government to help ensure jobs at the Brampton plant are not lost.

“Canadian auto jobs are being sacrificed on the Trump altar,” Unifor President Lana Payne said in a statement. “Stellantis cannot be allowed to renege on its commitments to Canadian workers, and governments cannot stand by while our jobs are shifted to the United States. Saving Brampton Assembly must now be this country’s top priority, sending a strong message to any corporation thinking they can take the same egregious actions.”

Nearly $400 million is going toward assembly of the new midsize pickup in Ohio, joining the Jeep Wrangler and Gladiator. Stellantis said it would add 900 jobs in Toledo to make the truck there, and it plans to continue with investments in Toledo that it announced previously.

Stellantis also confirmed a January announcement to make upgrades at several Kokomo, Ind., plants for a new four-cylinder engine to be made starting in 2026. The automaker said it will add more than 100 jobs and invest more than $100 million “to ensure that the U.S. will be the manufacturing home of this strategic powertrain.”

“This is a phenomenal testament to the recent work that has been done to strengthen the company’s relationship with dealers, while strengthening its overall presence in U.S. sales and production,” said Michael Bettenhausen, chairman of the Stellantis National Dealer Council.",https://s3-rd-prod.crainsdetroit.com/styles/1200x630/s3/SSTELLANTIS-MAIN_i_6_0.jpg,N,,2025-10-15 03:00:13.637579

Western North Carolina is home to a number of working writers; stop by one (or more!)","In September 2024, Hurricane Helene devastated Western North Carolina. The storm’s high winds barreled into the southern Appalachians on the heels of a thousand-year rain event. The French Broad River — which normally runs through Asheville at about half a foot — swelled to a staggering 27 feet. Hurricane-force winds tore down trees, and much of the area was without power and other basic utilities for weeks. A year later and haunting evidence of the storm still lingers.

Asheville, like much of the region, has struggled to rebound. This summer, hotel lodging demand was down about 10% from the same time last year. Employment in the hospitality industry is down by about the same amount. Tourist attractions like Chimney Rock State Park shuttered for repairs, and restaurants have struggled to turn a profit as visitors have stayed away.

But Asheville is climbing back. Trails are clear, shops and attractions are open again, and the music and food scenes hum with Asheville’s singular energy. Whether you’re passing through or planning a long weekend, you can spend in good conscience as you help a mountain city get back on its feet.

Farms and Markets

On Saturday morning, head to the University of North Carolina at Asheville campus for the North Asheville Tailgate Market, a producer-only farmers market with more than 70 vendors each week. Upwards of 80% of the market vendors earn their living from the crafts and products they make and sell. Budget plenty of time to sample vegan and dairy cheeses, browse native plants, and gawk at the vegetable bounty. Look out for Black Trumpet Farm’s dazzling mushrooms, Asheville Tea Company’s local blends, and Conjure Craft Chocolate’s gift-worthy bars.

The River Arts District, once full of galleries, shops, bars, and restaurants on the banks of the French Broad, was among the neighborhoods Helene damaged most. The River Arts District Farmers Market, in operation for more than two decades, has since relocated to New Belgium Brewing, where, on Wednesday afternoons from 3 to 6 p.m., you can shop from more than 30 local craftspeople and farmers who grow what they sell. East, West, and downtown Asheville, as well as neighboring towns Black Mountain, Weaverville, and Enka-Candler, also host tailgate markets with local producers. If market days don’t line up with your stay, browse the WNC Farmers Market, a vast emporium open daily, for local relishes, pickles, seasonal produce, fudge, and baked goods.

Restaurants and Chefs

Stop by Chef Meherwan Irani’s Indian street-food restaurant Chai Pani, which won a James Beard Award for Outstanding Restaurant in 2022, and don’t miss the vegetarian kale pakora chaat. Another Beard award winner, Chef Katie Button’s downtown restaurant Cúrate, whose name means “heal yourself,” has been serving Spanish tapas and curated wines for more than a decade. Chef Silver Iocovozzi and his husband, Cherry Iocovozzi, opened Neng Jr.’s in 2022. In short order, the Filipino restaurant earned Best New Restaurant nods from Bon Appétit, Esquire, and The New York Times. Make a reservation as soon as you can; the cozy, intimate space has only 18 seats.

Another 18-seat restaurant making waves well beyond city limits? Good Hot Fish, Chef Ashleigh Shanti’s modern fish camp, serves fish sandwiches, shrimp burgers, and “trout bologna and cheese” in the South Slope Brewing District. Make it part of a brewery-hopping tour of the neighborhood. There are several within walking distance, including Burial Beer Co. and The Funkatorium, which showcases sour beers. Nearby Antidote Cocktail Lounge is worth a visit, too ( Here’s a video on how to mix their “Savory Sailor” cocktail at home.). Find more funky flavors at Anoche, with its extensive collection of tequila and its sultry, smoky cousin, mezcal.

Ali Casparian, the executive director of Bounty & Soul, a local food justice organization, recommends restaurants and food businesses that prioritize local sourcing, sustainability, and community care. A few favorite restaurants include Posana, for its seasonal, locally sourced menu and commitment to sustainability; Chestnut, which has led Asheville’s composting and local food movement since the early 2000s; and The Blackbird, where modern Southern dishes highlight the Carolinas’ seasonal bounty. These spots, Casparian says, “reflect the values of our region.”

Venture about 20 minutes east of Asheville to Black Mountain to try South African cuisine at Bush Farmhouse, whose menu features produce grown on site, and Annie’s Cafe & Produce, a garden-to-table restaurant that has doubled as a relief kitchen after local disasters like Helene. (Read more about Annie’s efforts after Helene here.) The menu offers plenty of vegan and vegetarian options. Another destination worth the drive is Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.’s Mills River Taproom, about 20 minutes south of downtown Asheville. The sprawling brewery, set along a river, is a Disneyland for hopheads. A stage hosts local and touring acts, and the restaurant serves modern American cuisine and bar bites. Enjoy seasonal and year-round brews while you walk around the vegetable garden and admire hops vining on trellises, or in an Adirondack chair with a lush forest view.

Back in town, other consistently good standbys include Mehfil for Indian food; El Que Pasa, an unassuming strip-mall joint for Mexican; Tall John’s, a neighborhood tavern in the historic Montford area; and plant, a vegan bistro fit for special occasions.

Coffee and Tea

Stop into one of Dobrá Tea’s two locations for a midafternoon pick-me-up that doubles as an experience itself. Slip off your shoes and settle onto a cushion before you browse a thick menu of loose-leaf tea varieties from all over the world. Enjoy a vegan (or non-vegan) treat and linger over a pot of tea as you take in the tea house ambiance.

Asheville has no shortage of coffee shops. Three of the best are Rowan Coffee, with two artfully designed locations downtown and in West Asheville; Pollen Coffee + Flower Shop, where you can order a latte along with a bouquet of fresh blooms; and Farewell, which serves wine and light bites in addition to coffee-shop classics.

Things to Do and Places to Be

Asheville has a famously vibrant music scene. Look for local bands like Empire Strikes Brass and The Get Right Band gigging around town, or catch a show at The Grey Eagle, The Orange Peel, or Asheville Yards. (Check livemusicasheville.com for daily show listings.)

Attend an author event or just browse at Malaprop’s, one of the South’s best independent bookstores. Don’t miss the cookbook section, which has beautifully designed new releases, including vegetarian and vegan books. For curated used and local books, stop in at West Asheville’s Bagatelle Books, then get another physical-media fix across the street at Harvest Records.

Shop for secondhand outdoor gear at Second Gear, which relocated after Helene flooded its riverside space, then put your finds to good use in the mountains that surround the city. Walk the trails and check out a fascinating bonsai display at the North Carolina Arboretum, then joyride and take in stunning vistas on the nearby Blue Ridge Parkway. Chase waterfalls: Looking Glass Falls,Triple Falls, and Skinny Dip Falls are popular options, but get off the beaten track and you’ll likely discover waterfalls of your own.

Local Books

The city of Asheville and the spooky, atmospheric ambiance of the Southern Appalachians have inspired writers for generations. Thomas Wolfe, one of the city’s most famous literary sons, wrote the 1929 classic Look Homeward, Angel based on his own coming of age. William R. Forstchen’s One Second After is a terrifying post-apocalyptic thriller about a man trying to save his family after a terrorist attack sends his small North Carolina town back to a dark age. Ron Rash’s story collection Nothing Gold Can Stay spans from the Civil War to the present day and all the stories are set in Appalachia. His novel Serena tells the story of a newlywed couple who set out to build a timber empire in the area in 1929; the effort and their relationship bring shocking, violent twists. Wilma Dykeman’s 1955 nonfiction book The French Broad profiles the eponymous river, and Denise Kiernan’s The Last Castle dives into the sprawling Biltmore Estate and its effect on the city. Annette Clapsaddle is the first member of the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians to publish a novel; her 2020 book, Even as We Breathe, follows a Cherokee man as he leaves his people on the Qualla Boundary in 1942 and seeks a job at Asheville’s glamorous Grove Park Inn.

Types of Geothermal Energy There are several ways to get energy from deep within the Earth.
Some geothermal power stations can adjust their output to meet demand, rather than running continuously at maximum capacity.","As energy use rises and the planet warms, you might have dreamed of an energy source that works 24/7, rain or shine, quietly powering homes, industries and even entire cities without the ups and downs of solar or wind — and with little contribution to climate change.

The promise of new engineering techniques for geothermal energy — heat from the Earth itself — has attracted rising levels of investment to this reliable, low-emission power source that can provide continuous electricity almost anywhere on the planet. That includes ways to harness geothermal energy from idle or abandoned oil and gas wells. In the first quarter of 2025, North American geothermal installations attracted $1.7 billion in public funding — compared with $2 billion for all of 2024, which itself was a significant increase from previous years, according to an industry analysis from consulting firm Wood Mackenzie.

As an exploration geophysicist and energy engineer, I’ve studied geothermal systems’ resource potential and operational trade-offs firsthand. From the investment and technological advances I’m seeing, I believe geothermal energy is poised to become a significant contributor to the energy mix in the U.S. and around the world, especially when integrated with other renewable sources.

A May 2025 assessment by the U.S. Geological Survey found that geothermal sources just in the Great Basin, a region that encompasses Nevada and parts of neighboring states, have the potential to meet as much as 10 percent of the electricity demand of the whole nation — and even more as technology to harness geothermal energy advances. And the International Energy Agency estimates that by 2050, geothermal energy could provide as much as 15 percent of the world’s electricity needs.

Geothermal energy taps into heat beneath the Earth’s surface to generate electricity or provide direct heating. Unlike solar or wind, it never stops. It runs around the clock, providing consistent, reliable power with closed-loop water systems and few emissions.

Geothermal is capable of providing significant quantities of energy. For instance, Fervo Energy’s Cape Station project in Utah is reportedly on track to deliver 100 megawatts of baseload, carbon-free geothermal power by 2026. That’s less than the amount of power generated by the average coal plant in the U.S., but more than the average natural gas plant produces.

But the project, estimated to cost $1.1 billion, is not complete. When complete in 2028, the station is projected to deliver 500 megawatts of electricity. That amount is 100 megawatts more than its original goal without additional drilling, thanks to various technical improvements since the project broke ground.

And geothermal energy is becoming economically competitive. By 2035, according to the International Energy Agency, technical advances could mean energy from enhanced geothermal systems could cost as little as $50 per megawatt-hour, a price competitive with other renewable sources.

Types of Geothermal Energy

There are several ways to get energy from deep within the Earth.

Hydrothermal systems tap into underground hot water and steam to generate electricity. These resources are concentrated in geologically active areas where heat, water and permeable rock naturally coincide. In the U.S., that’s generally California, Nevada and Utah. Internationally, most hydrothermal energy is in Iceland and the Philippines.

Some hydrothermal facilities, such as Larderello in Italy, have operated for over a century, proving the technology’s long-term viability. Others in New Zealand and the U.S. have been running since the late 1950s and early 1960s.

Enhanced geothermal systems effectively create electricity-generating hydrothermal processes just about anywhere on the planet. In places where there is not enough water in the ground or where the rock is too dense to move heat naturally, these installations drill deep holes and inject fluid into the hot rocks, creating new fractures and opening existing ones, much like hydraulic fracturing for oil and gas production.

A system like this uses more than one well. In one, it pumps cold water down, which collects heat from the rocks and then is pumped back up through another well, where the heat drives turbines. In recent years, academic and corporate research has dramatically improved drilling speed and lowered costs.

Ground source heat pumps do not require drilling holes as deep, but instead take advantage of the fact that the Earth’s temperature is relatively stable just below the surface, even just six or eight feet down — and it’s hotter hundreds of feet lower.

These systems don’t generate electricity but rather circulate fluid in underground pipes, exchanging heat with the soil, extracting warmth from the ground in winter and transferring warmth to the ground in summer. These systems are similar but more efficient than air-source heat pumps, sometimes called minisplits, which are becoming widespread across the U.S. for heating and cooling. Geothermal heat pump systems can serve individual homes, commercial buildings and even neighborhood or business developments.

Direct-use applications also don’t generate electricity but rather use the geothermal heat directly. Farmers heat greenhouses and dry crops; aquaculture facilities maintain optimal water temperatures; industrial operations use the heat to dehydrate food, cure concrete or other energy-intensive processes. Worldwide, these applications now deliver over 100,000 megawatts of thermal capacity. Some geothermal fluids contain valuable minerals; lithium concentrations in the groundwater of California’s Salton Sea region could potentially supply battery manufacturers. Federal judges are reviewing a proposal to do just that, as well as legal challenges to it.

Researchers are also finding new ways to use geothermal resources. Some are using underground rock formations to store energy as heat when consumer demand is low and use it to produce electricity when demand rises.

Some geothermal power stations can adjust their output to meet demand, rather than running continuously at maximum capacity.

Geothermal sources are also making other renewable-energy projects more effective. Pairing geothermal energy with solar and wind resources and battery storage are increasing the reliability of above-ground renewable power in Texas, among other places.

And geothermal energy can power clean hydrogen production as well as energy-intensive efforts to physically remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, as is happening in Iceland.

Geothermal Potential in the U.S. and Worldwide

Currently, the U.S. has about 3.9 gigawatts of installed geothermal capacity, mostly in the West. That’s about 0.4 percent of current U.S. energy production, but the amount of available energy is much larger, according to federal and international engineering assessments.

And converting abandoned oil and gas wells for enhanced geothermal systems could significantly increase the amount of energy available and its geographic spread.

One example is happening in Beaver County, in the southwestern part of Utah. Once a struggling rural community, it now hosts multiple geothermal plants that are being developed to both demonstrate the potential and to supply electricity to customers as far away as California.

Those projects include repurposing idle oil or gas wells, which is relatively straightforward: Engineers identify wells that reach deep, hot rock formations and circulate water or another fluid in a closed loop to capture heat to generate electricity or provide direct heating. This method does not require drilling new wells, which significantly reduces setup costs and environmental disruption and accelerates deployment.

There are as many as 4 million abandoned oil and gas wells across the U.S., some of which could shift from being fossil fuel infrastructure into opportunities for clean energy.

Challenges and Trade-offs

Geothermal energy is not without technical, environmental and economic hurdles.

Drilling is expensive, and conventional systems need specific geological conditions. Enhanced systems, using hydraulic fracturing, risk causing earthquakes.

Overall emissions are low from geothermal systems, though the systems can release hydrogen sulfide, a corrosive gas that is toxic to humans and can contribute to respiratory irritation. But modern geothermal plants use abatement systems that can capture up to 99.9 percent of hydrogen sulfide before it enters the atmosphere. And the systems do use water, though closed-loop systems can minimize consumption.

Building geothermal power stations does require significant investment, but its ability to deliver energy over the long term can offset many of these costs. Projects like those undertaken by Fervo Energy show that government subsidies are no longer necessary for a project to get funded, built and begin generating energy.

Despite its challenges, geothermal energy’s reliability, low emissions and scalability make it a vital complement to solar and wind — and a cornerstone of a stable, low-carbon energy future.

Additionally, the company will invest nearly $100 million to retool the plant.
In Ohio, Stellantis announced a $400 million investment to assemble a new midsize truck at the Toledo Assembly Complex.
Stellantis also announced it is planning to bring more than $100 million and add 100 jobs to produce the new GMET4 EVO four-cylinder engine in Kokomo, Indiana.","Stellantis announced on Tuesday a $13 billion investment in four states, including new vehicles to be built in Michigan.

The new investment over the next four years is said to bring 5,000 jobs and production of five new vehicles in Illinois, Ohio, Michigan and Indiana. Officials say the investment is the largest in the company's 100-year history in the United States.

More than half of those jobs are geared toward the Belvidere Assembly Plant, which is expected to reopen in 2027 after it was idled at the end of February 2023.

In Michigan, the automaker plans to ""develop an all-new range-extended EV and internal combustion engine large SUV"" that will be produced at the Warren Truck Assembly Plant beginning in 2028, according to a news release. The production is expected to bring 900 jobs to the plant. Additionally, the company will invest nearly $100 million to retool the plant.

The Warren facility currently produces the Jeep Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer.

Stellantis also plans to invest $130 million in the Detroit Assembly Complex to produce the next-generation Dodge Durango beginning in 2029.

In a statement on Tuesday, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said the investment will ""help us continue to make cars and trucks that people rely on every day.""

""I am grateful to Stellantis for betting on Michigan once again, building on our work to bring more manufacturing back home,"" Whitmer said. ""Over the last few years, Stellantis has expanded in Michigan, and we will continue working with them to make it easier to manufacture in Michigan by investing in workforce development, cutting red tape, incentivizing R&D, and increasing government efficiency.

Whitmer added, ""Since I took office, we've worked across the aisle to win every possible auto project, securing more than 36,000 auto jobs. Thanks to partners like Stellantis and our massive network of auto suppliers, we will continue to dominate the auto industry and bring supply chains home even as we face national economic uncertainty. We don't care what you drive—gas, diesel, hybrid, or electric—as long as it's made in Michigan. Together, let's keep bringing manufacturing home, growing the middle class, and putting the world on wheels.""

Other investments include $600 million in Illinois to produce the Jeep Compass and Cherokee beginning in 2027, bringing 3,300 jobs. The automaker announced in January that it would reopen the Belvidere facility.

A look across its 142 square miles shows that it is still mired in poverty. Although it has probably leveled off, the city has lost a massive number of residents. It also has many abandoned houses that will remain indefinitely.

A small part of downtown has made a comeback, led by Rocket Companies founder Dan Gilbert, who has invested or brought hundreds of millions of dollars into the area. A portion of it has also been rebuilt by other companies. The most prominent example of this is Ford’s refurbishment of the Michigan Central Station. Ford spent $950 million on the project.

Ironically, very close by, the Renaissance Center—the tallest building in the city—was built largely due to efforts by Henry Ford II. General Motors bought the building and moved its headquarters there in the mid-1990s. The company is set to depart, leaving the huge building without a major tenant. All or parts of it may be demolished, which is a sign of how fragile Detroit’s downtown rebound really is.

Another part of Detroit’s comeback is a complex that houses the Detroit Lions and Detroit Tigers. In the same general development, Ford Field and Comerica Park sit next to one another.

Another section of downtown that has been extensively developed is around its casinos. These are the MGM Grand Detroit, Greektown Casino-Hotel, and MotorCity Casino Hotel. Among them, they bring tens of thousands of people to Detroit each year.

The Rest of the City

The demographics of the entire city are as bad as those of any major U.S. city. The poverty rate is over 31%. Median household income is under $40,000, or half the national average. The median home value is $106,000, which is about one-third the national median.

Detroit has been bleeding population since the 1950s. The 1950 Census showed Detroit’s population as 1,849,668. The figure for 2024 was 645,705, though that was up 1% from 2020. Detroit lost population in each decennial census from 1950 to 2020.

Federal standards, state bans and high-profile litigation are converging to create a challenging environment for businesses and policymakers.","PFAS, or “forever chemicals,” have been on the radar of regulators and industry for years, but the recent pace and scope of action mark a turning point.

Federal agencies are advancing the first national drinking water standards and expanding reporting and cleanup obligations, while the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) decision to list PFOA and PFOS as hazardous substances under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) opens the door to significant new liability.

State legislatures are moving even faster, adopting product bans, disclosure requirements and their own enforceable limits for drinking water. At the same time, courts are driving change through large-scale settlements with chemical manufacturers and water utilities, and insurers are narrowing coverage in response. For companies, utilities and policymakers, the combined effect is a regulatory and legal environment where PFAS risk is no longer theoretical but a pressing operational and financial challenge.

Federal Regulatory Developments

At the federal level, EPA and other agencies have accelerated PFAS controls. In April 2024, EPA adopted the first-ever national drinking water standards for PFAS, setting maximum contaminant levels (MCLs) for PFOA and PFOS at 4 parts per trillion and requiring controls on mixtures containing PFHxS, PFNA, GenX (HFPO-DA) and PFBS under a new “hazard index” approach. The rule is projected to protect roughly 100 million people. In May 2025, EPA announced it would retain the 4 ppt limits for PFOA and PFOS but reconsider the new limits for PFHxS, PFNA, GenX (HFPO-DA) and the mixed hazard index. EPA also announced the extension of the deadline for public water systems to comply with the PFOA and PFOS limits from 2029 to 2031, with a final rule expected in 2026. These changes reflect a more gradual federal approach even as states continue to set their own drinking water limits.

Beyond drinking water, EPA has been rolling out a range of other PFAS regulations that will impact industry. Under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), the EPA finalized a rule in January 2024 that restricts companies from resuming production or use of more than 300 PFAS chemicals without first undergoing a full federal review. Later that year, in October 2023, the agency also issued a reporting rule requiring any company that has made or imported PFAS since 2011 to disclose detailed information about how those substances were used, how much was produced and how they were managed or disposed of. The Toxics Release Inventory (TRI), a federal database that tracks chemical emissions, has been expanded to include dozens more PFAS, closing loopholes that had previously allowed companies to omit small quantities. The EPA has also developed new testing methods to detect PFAS in water, soil and air, and has proposed adding nine PFAS to the list of hazardous wastes regulated under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), which governs cleanup and waste disposal. Together, these steps reflect a broad federal effort to tighten oversight of PFAS production, reporting and cleanup.

Under CERCLA, the EPA took a major step in April 2024 by designating PFOA and PFOS as hazardous substances. This decision, which became effective that July, means that releases of those chemicals can now trigger what’s known as Superfund liability—the federal government’s authority to require responsible parties to pay for or perform cleanup of contaminated sites. That liability can be strict and retroactive, meaning companies may be held responsible for pollution that occurred years ago. To ease concerns about fairness, the agency issued guidance saying it would focus enforcement on companies that significantly contributed to PFAS pollution rather than on landowners or small entities that were simply affected by it. Industry groups quickly sued, arguing that EPA went beyond its authority, but in September 2025 the Department of Justice (DOJ) confirmed it would defend the rule. The agency has also said it plans to create a broader framework for how additional PFAS might be listed in the future. Administrator Zeldin has acknowledged concerns about unintentionally penalizing property owners or farmers who inherited contaminated land and has asked Congress to clarify the limits of liability under the law.

Other federal agencies are acting as well. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has moved to eliminate PFAS in food packaging. In early 2024, it announced that all grease-proofing agents containing PFAS, used in paper wrappers, pizza boxes and similar products, will cease due to industry phaseout and FDA’s withdrawal of approvals. In January 2025, the agency withdrew existing food-contact approvals for those PFAS, effectively banning PFAS-based food wrappers and bags. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has also taken steps, adapting programs to help farmers cope with PFAS exposure. For example, the Dairy Indemnity Payment Program now compensates producers for cows lost to PFAS contamination, and USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service offers cost-share assistance for PFAS testing of farm soil and water. These measures acknowledge the risk of PFAS leaching into crops and livestock.

State Legislative and Regulatory Trends

States remain the proving ground for PFAS controls. In the last two years, dozens of legislatures have enacted or considered bans, disclosure rules and mandates targeting PFAS in products and the environment. Comprehensive bans are emerging on major categories of PFAS use. California’s legislature in 2025 passed a bill phasing out intentional PFAS in consumer products, banning them in food packaging, children’s products, dental floss, cleaning products and ski wax by 2028, with cookware phased out by 2031. Illinois enacted a broad ban on PFAS in cookware, cosmetics, children’s products, personal care items, intimate apparel and food packaging, effective in 2026. Other states have targeted narrower sectors, banning PFAS in menstrual products or firefighting uniforms. Rhode Island has set a ban on PFAS in all firefighting gear beginning in 2027.

Disclosure mandates and reporting rules are also spreading. Illinois requires manufacturers of firefighting gear to report known PFAS uses and label products accordingly, with a full ban by 2027. Minnesota has a similar PFAS reporting law. Maine has enacted a law requiring public notification of PFAS levels in drinking water, and Delaware now requires the state to maintain a public PFAS information website and notify residents if utilities exceed thresholds.

Product restrictions and phaseouts continue to expand. Twenty states now ban PFAS in any paper food packaging, with more set to follow in 2027. States like Maine, Washington and New York have banned PFAS in children’s products, cosmetics and textiles, while cookware bans have been adopted in Minnesota, Colorado and Maine starting in 2025 and 2026. Vermont recently delayed its cookware ban to 2028 in response to industry concerns. Disclosure of PFAS-free certifications is also becoming common, with some states requiring sellers to obtain certificates of compliance for PFAS-free products.

Testing requirements are less uniform, but many states are adopting their own standards in addition to EPA rules. At least 20 states now have their own drinking water limits for one or more PFAS. New York passed legislation tightening its PFOA and PFOS limits to 4 ppt and adding a 10 ppt limit for other PFAS, while Pennsylvania and Vermont are considering even stricter standards. Some states now require utilities to test private wells in known contaminated areas. The result is a patchwork of testing and compliance requirements that continue to evolve.

Litigation and Settlements

PFAS litigation continues at a rapid pace, with settlements between chemical companies and public water utilities now reaching into the billions. In May 2024, Chemours agreed to pay $316.5 million to settle claims by a group of utilities over firefighting foam contamination. Later that year, Johnson Controls agreed to pay $750 million to resolve lawsuits brought by water systems across eight states. The largest settlement thus far came from 3M, which in 2023 agreed to pay up to $10.3 billion to settle claims from thousands of public water suppliers that alleged widespread PFAS contamination. Around the same time, Chemours, Corteva and DuPont jointly agreed to a separate $1.19 billion settlement covering similar claims. Most recently, in summer 2025, New Jersey announced a proposed $875 million settlement with DuPont, Chemours and Corteva to resolve decades of contamination within the state.

New lawsuits continue to emerge from states, municipalities and individual plaintiffs. More than 30 state attorneys general have sued PFAS manufacturers, while private and class action cases are expanding to include claims of health impacts and property damage. Courts are testing a range of legal theories, from nuisance and negligence to product liability and violations under federal and state hazardous waste laws. At the same time, insurers are tightening their policies by adding PFAS exclusions, leaving companies with fewer options for coverage and forcing many to consider self-insurance or alternative risk strategies.

Industry-Specific Impacts

PFAS rules are reshaping operations across multiple sectors. Manufacturers, especially chemical producers and consumer goods companies, face growing costs and liability risks. Many are phasing out PFAS, auditing supply chains and preparing for national retailers to demand PFAS-free certifications. Cookware, textiles, cosmetics and cleaning products are all facing state-level bans that will accelerate reformulation.

In food and beverage, the concern centers on packaging and contamination. FDA’s elimination of PFAS greaseproof paper has already forced restaurant chains, grocers and packaging suppliers to shift to alternatives. State bans are further pushing national food companies to reformulate packaging to comply with a patchwork of state laws. Beyond packaging, farmers and food producers are facing contamination risks in dairy, crops and livestock, prompting recalls and disruptions.

Public water systems must now test for PFAS under federal rules and upgrade treatment to meet MCLs. These upgrades will be costly and are already spurring litigation against PFAS manufacturers. Wastewater utilities are also grappling with biosolids contaminated by PFAS, in some cases halting land application programs entirely.

The aerospace and defense sector is having to address PFAS largely through firefighting foams and legacy contamination. The Department of Defense (DOD) has identified nearly 600 sites with PFAS releases and is working on a phased transition to PFAS-free foams. However, many of those cleanup efforts have been delayed into the 2030s, raising concerns among local communities. Defense contractors and DOD itself are also facing liability as potential responsible parties under CERCLA.

Looking Ahead

The PFAS landscape will remain dynamic through the next several years with an increased emphasis on remediation. EPA is expected to finalize a compliance extension for drinking water standards while reconsidering rules for additional PFAS. The CERCLA litigation could affect the scope of Superfund liability. At the state level, legislative activity is accelerating, with new bans and disclosure laws set to take effect in 2026 and beyond.

For clients, the key risks to monitor include rising compliance costs for testing and treatment, the spread of product bans and the growth of litigation targeting both manufacturers and downstream users. Insurers are moving quickly to exclude PFAS claims, leaving companies more exposed. Supply chains are tightening as major producers exit PFAS markets, and regulators continue to add compounds to their lists of concern.

In short, PFAS regulation has entered a new phase. Federal standards, state bans and high-profile litigation are converging to create a challenging environment for businesses and policymakers. Brownstein is tracking PFAS legislation and regulations on the federal level and across all 50 states. We can assist companies in monitoring this ever-changing landscape as companies review exposure risks, audit supply chains and begin planning now for a regulatory environment in which PFAS risk is unavoidable.

“It’s embedded into the operations, processes and decision making at each facility, project and program,” said Driscoll in remarks made in Washington, D.C., at the Public Utilities Fortnightly’s annual Fortnightly Top Innovators 2025 event.

An example of NYPA innovation is its Integrated Smart Operations Center, he noted. NYPA has deployed across the state more than 150,000 sensors “that are all fed into our office in White Plains and we use this tool as an asset” monitoring NYPA’s digital twin function.

“We’ve created a digital twin that shows what proper operations of all of our fleet look like – both transmission and generation – and then we compare that to real time sensor data,” he said. “We have actually spotted incidences where we’ve avoided having to take a forced outage and we’ve actually started to track how much money we’ve been saving through those sensor deployments and spotting through that digital twin effort” if there are irregularities in the operation of NYPA’s system.

Another example of NYPA innovation is its Advanced Grid Innovation Laboratory for Energy, or AGILe. At the lab, NYPA personnel utilize another digital twin technology to create a replica of the power system.

“We’ve modeled the entire grid all the way down to the distribution level and that means we can simulate extreme weather events, test renewable integration strategies – plug in a wind farm or solar farm in different parts of the state,” he said.

“We can optimize operations in a safe, controlled environment, all before making changes in the real world,” Driscoll said.

“For example, we can study the effects of adding a wind farm off the coast of Long Island or it could help us” in deciding where NYPA may site a nuclear power plant or plants, “depending upon whether we go with an SMR technology or an AP1000.”

In addition, “we can and have also simulated cyberattacks on the New York grid and we can test the latest cyber intrusion technologies to assess their effectiveness on our system.”

Outside the lab, “innovation is driving our approach to safety on the ground, from Niagara Falls to New York City. At our assets across the state we deploy drones and robotics for inspections – and by that we’re not just saving costs, we’re keeping workers safe, risking the machine and not the worker while gathering richer data to manage our assets.”

With respect to advanced nuclear power, he noted that NYPA is exploring next generation reactors “designed for enhanced safety and efficiency with smaller footprints, faster construction times and lower waste.”

Typically, families between 100 percent and 400 percent of the federal poverty line use these credits.
For example, a family of four with a household income of $65,000 a year sits at about 200% of the federal poverty line.","KNOXVILLE, Tenn. — The cost of healthcare remains at the center of debate on Capitol Hill, entering week three of the government shutdown. Republicans and Democrats are arguing over the future of ""enhanced premium tax credits,"" refundable tax credits created during the Affordable Care Act.

The credits are set to expire at the end of December if no new legislation is passed. The credits lower the cost of healthcare for people near the poverty line who buy health insurance from the Affordable Care Act marketplace.

A University of Tennessee expert said Congress has known about that expiration date for years.

""The expiration has always been understood because it's codified in federal law,"" said John Stavick, a budgets and finance professor at the University of Tennessee.

The credits were enhanced and extended during the American Rescue Plan Act in 2021, and then again during the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022, Professor Stavick said.

Lawmakers wanted to try and stimulate the economy and take some of the burden off of people who may have lost work, Stavick said.

The enhanced credits have always been temporary, but now, they're a main point of contention between Republicans and Democrats as the country enters the third week of a government shutdown.

Republicans want to cut back on how much the federal government is spending on these credits, Stavick said.

""The extra costs that had been subsidized by the federal government is now coming out of the pockets of households,"" he said.

Typically, families between 100 percent and 400 percent of the federal poverty line use these credits. There is actually no income cap to use the credits, Stavick said, but most people who make more than that use their employer's insurance, or aren't using ACA health care, he added.

For example, a family of four with a household income of $65,000 a year sits at about 200% of the federal poverty line.

With the enhanced credits, they currently pay about $100 a month for their family. Without the credit, they'd pay about $350 a month for their family.

""The credits will be structured differently [if they expire],"" Stavick said. ""It will revert back to the pre-American Rescue Plan era.""

If someone makes near 100% of the federal poverty line, or about $20,000 a year--right now, they pay nothing for healthcare.

If the credits expire, they'd pay about 2% of their monthly income, or about $30 a month.

The Congressional Budget Office estimates the existing enhanced credit system would cost about $350 billion more over the next 10 years than the status quo credit system.",https://media.wbir.com/assets/WBIR/images/2872015e-266f-45c8-85df-e1df9da0045d/20251014T213553/2872015e-266f-45c8-85df-e1df9da0045d_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-10-14 20:59:57.325574

(Reuters) -Global sales of fully electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles rose 26% in September from a year ago to a record 2.1 million units, driven by strong demand in China and a late U.S. tax-credit rush, market research firm Rho Motion said on Wednesday.

China accounted for about two-thirds of global sales with about 1.3 million units, while North America also hit a record as U.S. buyers moved to secure incentives before they expired, said Rho Motion data manager Charles Lester.

WHY IT’S IMPORTANT

China is the world’s biggest car market and accounts for more than half of global EV sales, which in Rho Motion’s data include battery-electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids.

September, typically China’s busiest month for car buying, saw sales rise as shoppers looked to make the most of trade-in subsidies before some regions started phasing them out.

U.S. demand reflected a surge as buyers rushed to claim the expiring $7,500 EV tax credit, although demand is expected to decline sharply in the fourth quarter “as both consumers and businesses lose access to the federal incentives that have underpinned EV purchases”, Rho Motion said.

Europe also hit a new high, helped by incentives in Germany and strong demand in Britain, while Tesla’s rollout of a lower-cost Model Y in Europe is expected to further intensify competition in coming months.

BY THE NUMBERS

Global sales of battery-electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids rose 26% to a record 2.1 million units in September, Rho Motion data showed.

Chinese sales rose to about 1.3 million vehicles. European sales jumped 36% to 427,541 units, while North American sales climbed 66% to about 215,000. Sales in the rest of the world jumped 48% to 153,594 vehicles.

KEY QUOTE

“With the federal incentive gone, U.S. demand is expected to drop sharply in the final quarter of the year,” Lester said.

Some automakers such as General Motors and Hyundai are trying to soften the blow by offering discounts or tapping dealer inventories, but overall production is being scaled back, he added.

The EV tax credit ended last month. The clean vehicle tax credit was worth $7,500 for new EVs and up to $4,000 for used ones.

General Motors, which had led the way among U.S. automakers with plans to convert production to an electric fleet of vehicles, said in a regulatory filing on Tuesday that it will have to book charges that include non-cash impairment and other charges of $1.2 billion due to EV capacity adjustments. There’s also $400 million in charges mostly related to contract cancellation fees and commercial settlements associated with EV-related investments.

GM warned that it may take additional hits as it adjusts production, with non-cash charges potentially impacting operations and cash flow in the future.

The company said that its EV capacity realignment doesn’t impact its retail portfolio of Chevrolet, GMC and Cadillac EVs currently in production, and that it expects those models to remain available to consumers.

EVs were considered to be the future of the US automotive industry. In 2021 GM said that it planned to have more than half of its North American and China factories be capable of making electric vehicles by 2030. It also also pledged at the time to increase its investment in EV charging networks by nearly $750 million through 2025.

Esmeralda 7 is set to be the largest solar project in the U.S. by capacity. The project’s National Environmental Policy Act status is listed as canceled on the Bureau of Land Management’s website. In a Tuesday email, the spokesperson said the BLM had not canceled the project.

“During routine discussions prior to the lapse in appropriations, the proponents and BLM agreed to change their approach for the Esmeralda 7 Solar Project in Nevada,” they said. “Instead of pursuing a programmatic level environmental analysis, the applicants will now have the option to submit individual project proposals to the BLM to more effectively analyze potential impacts.”

According to a draft programmatic environmental impact statement for the project from July of last year, the individual projects are: Lone Mountain Solar, Nivloc Solar, Smoky Valley Solar, Red Ridge 1 Solar, Red Ridge 2 Solar, Esmeralda Energy Center and Gold Dust Solar, which “would be geographically contiguous and encompass approximately 62,300 acres of BLM-administered lands approximately 30 miles west of Tonopah, Nevada.”

Developers of the seven projects include Invenergy, Avantus, and NextEra. A spokesperson for NextEra told The Guardian, “We are in the early stage of development and remain committed to pursuing our project’s comprehensive environmental analysis by working closely with the Bureau of Land Management.” All of the projects have pending right-of-way applications before the Bureau of Land Management, the draft PEIS said.

As the project’s previous NEPA review process has been canceled, it’s unclear how long it will now take each project to secure approvals. The original draft PEIS said that the timelines for construction “would vary by project with estimates of 18 to 36 months,” and that “the timing of project approvals and the availability of the construction contractors and workforce would also differ by project. It is assumed that full buildout of all projects could be completed within 5 years from the Record of Decision for the PEIS/[Resource Management Plan Amendment].”

The Environmental Defense Fund criticized Interior’s decision to cancel the project’s review, calling it “yet another example of how the Trump administration is taking a two-tiered approach to energy permitting: polluting, expensive fossil fuels get ‘concierge, white glove service,’ while cheap renewables and storage get freezes, delays and cancellations.”

Assessing each project individually fits with an overall trend in the Trump administration’s treatment of renewable energy projects sited on federal land.

Attendees from across Texas are at the summit to receive new data on groundwater levels and learn about techniques that cities, businesses, and homeowners can use to help recycle and conserve water.

“What are you doing as a lawmaker to protect our water resources, especially in the Texas Panhandle?”

“Yeah, so we pull from an aquifer that is depleting. Everybody knows it, the other states that are pulling from it know it,” said Charles Perry, state senator, Texas District 28. “We have to learn how to use that water to the max.”

The state of Texas, on average, currently uses around 17 million acre-feet of water as the population continues to grow and as more industry comes to the Lone Star State, the amount of water we use will only increase.

“So, Texas is growing very rapidly, and we got these new demands for water,” said Dr. Robert Mace, executive director for Meadows Center for Water & Environment. “Data centers are a big one in this area. We’re pumping the Ogallala Aquifer about six times the rate as it's refilling back up and so we are in a depleting resource out here on the High Plains.”

“There is a pathway to bringing more water to this region, and if you get that water to Lubbock and or to Amarillo, and those guys are using options, and that will quit depleting the aquifer by the municipal use,” said Perry. “If we can mitigate municipal use growing at that level and then stabilize it by not using it, then farmers will have more water going forward.”

Integrating remote sensing and understanding how to quantify groundwater extraction and evaluating water use efficiency in irrigated cotton fields will serve as the final program on Wednesday. It will start at 4:15 p.m. There are a number of breakout sessions and panel sessions planned for the two-day summit.",https://abc7amarillo.com/resources/media2/16x9/3024/986/0x1166/90/f0fea128-ff4d-47a1-bc6b-506426b93220-1000002809.jpg,N,,2025-10-14 20:02:40.568477

Greenbaum Rowe Smith & Davis LLP has bolstered two key practice areas with the addition of John P. Gray, a former official with two prominent state agencies.

Gray, who held significant roles with both the Department of Environmental Protection and NJ Transit, joins the law firm as a partner in its environmental and energy and renewable resources groups. He does so with nearly 24 years of experience, which he’ll use to assist Greenbaum’s clients in navigating the complexities of environmental and agency approvals for development projects, having honed his skills in regulatory compliance and strategic planning prior to entering private practice.

“After two decades of delivering critical environmental and construction guidance in public service roles, I’m eager to take on new challenges by working with Greenbaum’s amazing team to help our clients tackle their legal challenges and successfully meet their business goals,” Gray said. “In a constantly changing landscape of complex regulations, I look forward to delivering solutions that assist clients with meeting their evolving needs.”

Gray’s work with DEP included leading efforts in permitting complex projects such as electric generation, major remediation and large-scale infrastructure, Greenbaum said, noting that he also served as a legislative liaison on regulatory matters and constituent and policy formulation issues. With NJ Transit, he managed legal services, oversaw compliance with federal and state funding requirements and responded to audits and inquiries from agencies such as the U.S. Department of Justice.

""At each meeting in Washington, we raise the subject of defending Ukrainian Energy and supporting our resilience during the winter as well as ways to defend this,"" Prime Minister Yulia svyrydenko posted on Telegram. She said that the priority of her visit was ""energy, sanctions, and new ways of cooperating with the USA to strengthen both of our countries"". Zelenskiy met with Donald Trump, the U.S. president on Friday, to discuss Ukraine’s air defence capabilities and long-range strikes. Both leaders met twice over the weekend to intensify discussions regarding the possible provision of long-range Tomahawks missiles to Kyiv. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, during his talks with Svyrydenko ""reaffirmed United States unwavering support of Ukrainian sovereignty"" and stressed the United States commitment to securing an lasting, durable peace, according to U.S. Treasury. Svyrydenko was also thanked for his support of the U.S. Ukraine Reconstruction Investment Fund that the Ukrainian Prime Minister helped to establish earlier this year. In September, Ukraine and the U.S. held their first joint board meeting. The fund was created as part of an agreement to grant Washington access to Ukrainian mineral deposits in exchange for investments.

Glass Lewis, proxy advisor, ends benchmark recommendations under pressure

Glass Lewis, a major proxy adviser, will stop offering its ""benchmark voting"" recommendations in 2027. Instead they will provide a new set of options to clients. Glass Lewis sent a paper stating that there is a growing divide between the U.S. investors and Europeans in regards to issues such as fiduciary duties and sustainability. A spokesperson for the company said that the change in policy was also indirectly the result of criticisms the firm received from Republican politicians in the United States. The spokesperson stated that ""the whole geopolitical climate is connected to this."" Glass Lewis, and its rival Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS), have come under pressure by politicians who are aligned with corporate management, as topics such as executive pay and climate politics have gained more attention at annual corporate meetings. In Texas, for example, two firms are under investigation by the Republican Attorney General of the state over whether or not they have violated consumer protection laws, including rules about disclosing important facts. The two companies deny any wrongdoing and have won separate preliminary injunctions that block a new state statute that would have forced them to inform clients of their advice regarding environmental, social, and governance issues, which does not only serve the financial interests of shareholders. Glass Lewis announced in its paper published on Tuesday that it will use AI to ""move away from a one size fits all approach to a highly customizable, client-centric Framework."" Glass Lewis will allow clients to create their own voting frameworks and will provide research that supports various voting perspectives, including those focused management views, governance, or sustainability priorities. A spokesperson for ISS said that it will continue to adhere to its benchmark policy, but also noted that it has introduced new products and services for investors. These include research which does not contain voting recommendations. Aaron Bertinetti is the CEO of Investor Engagement in North America at Computershare. This business includes shareholder outreach as well as investor relations. He expects that both functions will be more important, especially when proxy advisor recommendations are smaller. In the past, companies were able to easily identify investors that they should be trying to influence. Bertinetti stated that ""now the influence has become dispersed, and is much more difficult to track.""

Doctors without Borders closes Haiti's emergency clinic as a 'last-resort'

Doctors without Borders announced on Tuesday that it will close an emergency clinic located in Port-au-Prince, Haiti's capital city. The closure is due to the violent clashes which have been ongoing in the area and are a threat to the safety of both staff and patients. MSF has been suspending operations at the Turgeau health clinic, which is located near an high school and several government ministries, ever since March. MSF reported that its vehicles, which were clearly marked, were targeted by gunfire 15 times during the evacuation. Why it's important Haiti has been in a conflict for years with armed groups that have taken control of much of its capital. This has limited the supply of goods, services, and the safe movement of three million residents of the metropolitan area. Many aid groups have left or suspended operations in Haiti due to the violence, limiting their options at a time when the healthcare system is on the verge of collapse. KEY QUOTE MSF's Chief of Mission in Haiti Jean-Marc Biquet stated in a press release that the area around the Port-au-Prince center has been a scene of regular violence for several weeks. The clinic's building was also hit by bullets several times. ""MSF regrets the difficult decision that was made as a final resort. The closure will have a major impact on the access to healthcare of a population that is already suffering from violence, insecurity and precarious living situations. CONTEXT MSF stated that it was waiting for the signing of the memorandum-of-understanding which would establish a humanitarian corridor between Carrefour and the capital before it resumed medical activities between Port-au-Prince's suburb and the downtown. The Turgeau clinic's staff has reported several attacks. One incident occurred in November last year when an ambulance stopped and its staff was threatened. Patients were also killed. Another involved a patient being forcibly taken out of an ambulance, then shot, just a few feet away from the Turgeau Clinic. By the Numbers According to the World Health Organization and the United Nations, only 13% of 254 Haitian hospitals assessed in June were fully operational. Just 5% of 93 systems assessed in the Port-au-Prince metropolis were fully functional.

US stocks finish mixed; gold surges amid positive IMF forecast and trade tensions

Wall Street ended Tuesday with mixed results and gold reached a new record high, as investors took into account the positive economic outlook from the International Monetary Fund Jerome Powell, Federal Reserve Chair, against a resurgence of U.S.-China Trade Tensions The stock market lost momentum in the late session following U.S. president Donald Trump He posted on social media about his decision. Trade ties can be cut off The Dow recovered from an early sell-off and managed to make modest gains. Crude prices dropped, and the benchmark U.S. Treasury Yields eased. The S&P and Nasdaq ended the session in the negative. Powell stated in a Tuesday speech that the U.S. overall economy ""may have a firmer trajectory than anticipated."" He also warned that there is no ""risk-free policy path as we navigate between the tensions between our employment goals and inflation targets."" This echoes an IMF report that raised its global outlook for growth as the shocks from tariffs and financial conditions were less severe than expected. The IMF, however, warned that a trade war between two of the largest economies in the world could have a significant impact on output. Peter Cardillo is the chief market economist of Spartan Capital Securities, based in New York. Tuesday, the U.S. began charging China tit-fortat port charges. The bilateral trade tensions that have roiled the world markets in this year erupted late last week when China tightened its controls on rare earth exports. Trump responded by threatening to raise tariffs on Chinese imports up to triple digits. Bank Earnings Kick Off Earnings Season Upbeat quarterly results by high-profile financial companies including JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs as well as Citigroup, Wells Fargo, and Citigroup kicked off the third-quarter earning season. Cardillo said that if the banks are any guide, this will likely be a good earning season. Cardillo added, ""That is another factor that supports the recent highs in the market."" The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 202.88, or 0.44% to 46,270.46. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 dropped 10.41, or 0.16% to 6,644.31, and the Nasdaq Composite declined 172.91, or 0.76% to 22,521.70. Investors watched developments in France where the Prime Minister appeared to be holding off on a major pension overhaul. MSCI's global stock index fell by 2.45 points or 0.25 percent to 978.64. The pan-European STOXX 600 fell 0.37% while Europe's broad FTSEurofirst 300 fell 7.41 points or 0.33%. Treasury yields fell but were still off their lows after Powell's remarks and the IMF revised its growth outlook. The yield of the benchmark 10-year U.S. notes dropped 2.3 basis points from Friday's 4.051% to 4.028%. The yield on 30-year bonds fell 1.1 basis point to 4.6234%, from 4.634% at the end of Friday. The oil prices dropped on the back of trade war fears and a report by the International Energy Agency that raised the prospect for increased supplies while dampening the demand. U.S. crude oil fell 1.33% on the day to settle at 58.70 dollars per barrel. Brent settled at $62.39 dollars per barrel. Due to increased trade-driven risks, the dollar declined while the Swiss Franc and Japanese yen strengthened. The dollar index (which measures the greenback versus a basket including the yen, euro and Swiss franc) fell by 0.26% at 99.04 while the euro rose by 0.31% to $1.1604. The dollar fell 0.37% against the Japanese yen to 151.71. The latest salvo of the Washington-Beijing Trade Spat boosted demand for gold to surpass $4,100. Spot gold increased by 0.75%, to $4140.97 per ounce. U.S. Gold Futures increased 0.77% to $4140.20 per ounce.

A trade group wants to prohibit the export of scrap aluminium cans to China

A trade group representing aluminum industry demanded on Tuesday a ban on U.S. imports of used beverage containers to China in order to support American productions of cars, fighter planes, tanks, and satellites. The Aluminum Association stated that the United States exports more than 2,000,000 tons of aluminum scrap each year while consuming between 5 and 6 million tons. The group demanded an immediate ban on the export of used beverage containers outside North America for national security reasons, stating that much of U.S. waste flows to China, where it is processed before being shipped back to North America as finished products. The group stated that the U.S. Aluminum industry faces an annual supply gap of approximately 4 million metric tonnes of raw aluminum. They also said it would take many years to become self-sufficient, as well as billions of dollars in addition to accessing a large amount of affordable energy. Nearly half of the scrap aluminum exported by the United States is recycled. The association stated that this is especially concerning because the demand for aluminum in important areas such as cars, planes, and packaging has been growing. In June, President Donald Trump imposed tariffs of 50% on aluminum metal imported to the United States. Canada imports two-thirds the total amount of primary aluminum used in the United States each year. The Commerce Department announced in August that it would be increasing steel and aluminum tariffs for more than 400 products, including auto parts worth $240 billion annually. These parts include electrical steel and automotive exhaust systems needed for electric vehicles, as well as bus components. The U.S. tariffs do not only apply to steel and aluminium, but also to many 'derivatives' made from these metals. (Reporting and editing by Chris Reese, Chizu Nomiyama)

US stocks are mixed and gold is up as economic forecasts outweigh trade tensions

Wall Street stocks were mixed Tuesday, and Treasury yields fell as investors weighed the upbeat economic outlook from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell with renewed U.S. China trade tensions. S&P 500, Dow and crude prices all fell sharply after the opening of the three major U.S. indexes. Gold prices, a safe haven, also jumped above $4,100 for the first time. The Nasdaq, which is dominated by tech stocks, remained modestly lower. Powell warned that the U.S. overall economy may be ""on a slightly firmer trajectory than anticipated"" in a speech he gave on Tuesday. He also said there was no ""risk-free policy path as we navigate between our employment goals and inflation targets."" This was in line with an IMF report that raised its outlook for global growth as the impact of tariffs and financial conditions has been less than expected. The IMF, however, warned that a trade war between two of the largest economies in the world could have a significant impact on output. Peter Cardillo is the chief market economist of Spartan Capital Securities, a New York-based brokerage. On Tuesday, the United States and China started charging port fees tit for tat. Late last week, bilateral trade tensions that have roiled world markets in recent years erupted after China tightened its controls on rare earth exports. U.S. president Donald Trump responded by threatening to raise tariffs on Chinese products into triple digits. The third quarter earnings season kicked off with positive quarterly results from high profile financial firms such as JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs. Citigroup, Wells Fargo, and Citigroup also reported good results. Cardillo said that if the banks are any guide, this will likely be a good earning season. This is another factor that supports the recent highs in the market. LSEG data show that analysts estimate an aggregate growth rate of 9.2% year-on-year for the S&P500 in the third quarter, up from the 8.8% reported at the start of the month. Official economic data are unavailable as the U.S. shutdown continues due to a partisan impasse in Congress. A National Association of Independent Business survey showed that small business sentiment was deteriorating, as inflation concerns returned to the forefront. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 392.34 points or 0.85% to 46,460.87. The S&P 500 rose 18.74 points or 0.28% to 6,673.46. And the Nasdaq Composite dropped 42.25 points or 0.18% to 22,652.35.

Russian official: Work to restore connection to Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Plant begins this week

On Tuesday, a Russian official announced that the restoration of external power to Zaporizhzhia's nuclear power plant in Russia will begin this week. The station has been operating on diesel generators since it was shut down for three weeks. In the first few weeks of Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Russian forces captured the Zaporizhzhia Plant. Both sides have accused each other of military actions that led to the collapse of the external line on July 23, 2022. Mikhail Ulyanov is Russia's permanent representative at international organizations in Vienna. He told Russian state news agency RIA that ""active preparations are currently underway."" We expect that the repair work will begin on both transmission lines by the end of the week. Ulyanov stated that in order to carry out the repairs, it is ""essential to agree on local ceasefires in the areas where the work will be carried out"". The Vienna-based U.N. Nuclear watchdog International Atomic Energy Agency has repeatedly called for both sides to refrain form actions that compromise nuclear safety. The plant is Europe's biggest with six reactors. It produces no electricity right now, but it needs to produce power in order to keep the fuel cool inside and avoid any possible meltdown. Rafael Grossi, Director General of the IAEA, said that the diesel generators provide the needed power and has worked with both sides to restore the external links. Ukraine's Foreign Minister accused Russia of intentionally severing an external power line at the station to connect it to Moscow's grid. This month, a top Russian diplomat denied that Russia has any intention to restart the plant. (Reporting and Editing by Lisa Shumaker).

Gold as a safe-haven reaches record highs above $4,100/oz due to Fed rate cuts and trade worries

The gold price surpassed the $4,100 mark on Tuesday. This was boosted by the expectation of a rate reduction this month by the U.S. Federal Reserve, and by investors fleeing to safety following a resurgence in trade tensions with Beijing. As of 1:50 pm, spot gold was up 0.9% at $4,145.85 an ounce. ET (1750 GMT) after reaching a record-high of $4,179.48 in earlier session. U.S. Gold Futures for December Delivery gained 0.7% and settled at $4,163.40. Metal prices have risen by 57% in the past year. On Monday, they broke the $4,100 barrier. The rally was driven by a number of factors including geopolitical uncertainty, the expectation of U.S. rate cuts, central bank purchases and strong ETF inflows. Bank of America analysts and Societe Generale see gold at $5,000/oz by 2026. The uptick in U.S. - China trade tensions, ongoing government shutdown and expectations of more Fed easing all support gold, said Peter Grant. Grant said that U.S. president Donald Trump's threat to impose 100% duties on Chinese products, the roll-out of tit for tat port charges by both of the world's largest economies, and a macro-trend of de-dollarization, could push gold up to $5,000/oz in mid-next-year. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced on Monday that Trump will meet Chinese leader Xi Jinping later this month in South Korea. Gold that does not yield tends to perform well in low interest rate environments. The markets are expecting a 25 basis-point cut in the Fed's rate this month. This will be followed by another reduction of 25 basis points in December. Fed Chair Jerome Powell stated during his speech to the National Association for Business Economics' annual meeting that ""based on the data we have, it seems fair to say the outlook for unemployment and inflation has not changed much since the September meeting four week ago.""

Whenever someone buys new tires or a new vehicle with tires, a charge is added in the form of a waste tire cleanup and recycling fee.
Of 2,060 notices successfully sent to waste tire generators, 483 users submitted their reports through the portal, the agency said.
“This system is secure, efficient and user-friendly — exactly the kind of innovation that helps both our stakeholders and our staff work smarter.” For fiscal year 2024-25, the state collected $13.3 million in waste tire fees.
Earlier this year, LDEQ began offering $20,000 grants to local governments to help with tire recycling and tackling the widespread problem of illegal tire dumping.","Louisiana has launched an online portal for businesses that generate waste tires and collect fees for the state to recycle them.

Auto dealers, tire shops and others who sell cars or tires can now submit their monthly reports and fee payments through a secure digital portal on the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality website, according to a news release the agency released Tuesday.

Whenever someone buys new tires or a new vehicle with tires, a charge is added in the form of a waste tire cleanup and recycling fee. The fee ranges from $2.25 per tire for standard sized wheels on passenger vehicles and pickup trucks, $5 for medium truck tires and $10 for off-road tires. All tire dealers and new car dealers in Louisiana are required by law to collect the fees from their customers at the point of sale and then forward them to the state Treasury at the end of every month.

Using the portal carries its own convenience fee of $2.50 per payment, and credit card transactions carry an additional 2.5% fee.

LDEQ officials said the portal saw strong participation in September, its first full month in use. Of 2,060 notices successfully sent to waste tire generators, 483 users submitted their reports through the portal, the agency said.

“The response from users in the first month has been extremely positive,” LDEQ Undersecretary Theresa Delafosse said in the release. “This system is secure, efficient and user-friendly — exactly the kind of innovation that helps both our stakeholders and our staff work smarter.”

For fiscal year 2024-25, the state collected $13.3 million in waste tire fees. The state uses the money to recycle used tires, an effort that poses technological and environmental challenges because of the complex designs of modern tires with layers of rubber, plastic, fabric and metal. Shredding tires releases chemicals and microplastics that are harmful to the environment and pose health risks to humans, according to LDEQ. Additionally, the presence of steel belts in tires complicates the recycling process, requiring specialized equipment to separate the layers.

Earlier this year, LDEQ began offering $20,000 grants to local governments to help with tire recycling and tackling the widespread problem of illegal tire dumping. In September, the pilot program awarded the grants to six local governments: the parishes of Iberville, Lafourche, Ouachita and Terrebonne and the cities of Gretna and West Monroe.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/5C5A8557.jpg,N,,2025-10-14 20:03:37.185429

Iowa Environmental Council, Environmental Law & Policy Center and Food & Water Watch, the groups that penned the letter to EPA, also obtained records, via a public information request, on communications between DNR and EPA.
The environmental groups allege any additional information, including explanation from DNR, occurred in an “undocumented oral conversation” which was referenced in an obtained email.
Michael Schmidt, general counsel for Iowa Environmental Council said the decision “lacks transparency” and was “based on outdated” information.
The environmental groups argued the nitrate standard used does not apply solely to chronic effects.","Environmental groups penned a letter to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency urging the federal agency to maintain its previously rescinded ruling that seven segments of Iowa rivers were impaired due to nitrate concentrations.

The environmental groups said EPA’s decision to delist these segments was “inconsistent” with the law, failed to hold polluters accountable and would lead to increased regulatory costs for water treatment in Iowa.

The decision from EPA followed a summer with near-record high nitrate levels in the Des Moines and Raccoon rivers near Des Moines and the first-ever lawn watering ban from Central Iowa Water Works on account of the high nitrate concentrations, coupled with summer water demand.

Dani Replogle, staff attorney for the environmental group Food & Water Watch, called the EPA decision “baseless” and said it “does not inspire confidence in the federal agency meant to safeguard clean water and protect our health.”

“The data is clearer than ever that Iowa waterways are overwhelmed with persistent, toxic nitrate contamination,” Replogle said in a statement. “Iowans need more clean water protections — not less.”

Background

EPA ruled in January that the Iowa Department of Natural Resources needed to add seven river segments to its 2024 list of impaired water segments. This decision, which EPA said was due to the high levels of nitrate and “nitrate plus nitrite,” another form of combined nitrogen similar to nitrate, in the segments, was rescinded by EPA in July.

EPA said in their letter changing the decision that it is seeking additional information from DNR to determine “whether ‘good cause’ exists to not include the seven referenced waters.”

The original decision was opposed by DNR, with DNR’s executive director Kayla Lyon arguing the agency was holding Iowa’s department to “a very high standard.” DNR argued the designation would yield higher costs and greater regulatory oversight associated with the designation.

The impaired segments, on the Cedar, Des Moines, Raccoon, Iowa and South Skunk rivers, serve as drinking water sources for several municipalities including Des Moines, Iowa City and Cedar Rapids.

EPA holds that concentrations of nitrate and nitrite above 10 milligrams per liter in drinking water can lead to shortness of breath, blue-baby syndrome or even death in infants under the age of 6 months. Other research indicates long-term exposure to nitrate in drinking water is linked to certain types of cancer.

According to the EPA’s letter from July, announcing the recission of the impaired water segments, DNR did not list the segments in its impaired list because it applied standards for nitrate that “solely protect against chronic effects” while EPA applied standards that apply to both chronic and acute effects of nitrate.

Per EPA’s letter, this information was made clear in May 2025 when DNR submitted additional information to EPA explaining why the segments do not need an impairment listing.

Iowa Environmental Council, Environmental Law & Policy Center and Food & Water Watch, the groups that penned the letter to EPA, also obtained records, via a public information request, on communications between DNR and EPA. Per the records request, the documents submitted were DNR’s 2001 water quality standards document and EPA’s subsequent approval of the standards.

The groups allege these documents, being more than 20 years old, were already submitted to EPA. The environmental groups allege any additional information, including explanation from DNR, occurred in an “undocumented oral conversation” which was referenced in an obtained email.

The environmental groups, in their letter, argue these actions were “outside the process contemplated” in the Clean Water Act, which allows for a change to impaired water lists when EPA requests additional documents, and for public comment.

Michael Schmidt, general counsel for Iowa Environmental Council said the decision “lacks transparency” and was “based on outdated” information.

“EPA’s action undermines the public process defined in federal regulations and limits public transparency,” Schmidt said in a statement.

An EPA spokesperson said in a statement that DNR’s impaired waters list for 2024 made use of data from 2020-2022.

“IDNR is in the process of compiling and assessing water quality data from 2022-2024 and is expected to public notice its draft 2026 list early next year, which will include an assessment of these same seven water segments,” the spokesperson said in an emailed statement. “Concurrently, EPA will be working with IDNR to understand and resolve the issues forming the basis for EPA’s reconsideration of its 2024 decision.”

The spokesperson said it is working with DNR in the “spirit of cooperative federalism” and using “the latest information” to ensure water quality standards are “followed and upheld.”

“EPA has been tracking the levels of nitrate and is ensuring that all of the information and data collected by the cities, universities, and other groups is provided to the Iowa Department of Natural Resources (IDNR) for evaluation,” the spokesperson said.

Acute vs chronic

DNR argued its application of nitrate parameters pertained to chronic effects, which is why the department chose not to list the seven segments. The environmental groups argued the nitrate standard used does not apply solely to chronic effects.

The letter from environmental groups argued a symptom like blue-baby syndrome is an acute, rather than chronic, health outcome and is prevented by the EPA via the maximum contaminant levels, or MCLs, adopted under the Safe Drinking Water Act. The letter alleges the cited 2001 water quality standards from DNR incorporated these MCLs “as the water quality standard.”

A spokesperson for DNR declined to comment on the environmental groups’ letter and their position against the department’s reasoning.

In public comments to EPA’s original action, DNR director Lyon said the federal agency’s decision was incorrect because nitrate is not a “toxic pollutant.” The letter countered this argument by saying EPA’s toxic pollutant list outdated.

The letter said “overlooking the acute consequences” of high nitrate is inconsistent with the Safe Drinking Water Act.

Environmental groups also cited Iowa Code for water quality standards and argued the “narrative” standards for surface water prohibit “toxic pollutants in toxic amounts.”

The referenced state standards note that substances toxic to humans, or “detrimental to treatment process” must have limited concentrations in surface water.

Water treatment facilities are responsible for keeping contaminants, like nitrate, within legal limits for drinking water. In Des Moines, where the Des Moines and Raccoon rivers were both elevated above 10 mg/L for nearly 70 days this summer, water treatment facilities were forced to run costly nitrate removal systems for more than 110 days this summer.

Environmental groups via the letter, said removing the segments from the impaired list “fails to address the causes” of pollution and “unfairly burdens” water treatment facilities.

Leadership from Des Moines Water Works echoed this sentiment following EPA’s delisting decision. They said in a news release that the decision did not align with financial and operational realities the utility faced in providing clean drinking water to the city.

Once a water segment is listed as impaired, EPA and DNR develop water quality improvement plans, known as a Total Maximum Daily Load or TMDLs, that require reductions to the known pollutant.

“Drinking water issues across the state, from western Iowa to the waters removed from the list by EPA, demonstrate the necessity for further action to address pollution in drinking water sources,” the letter said.

Iowa Environmental Council Water Program Director Colleen Fowle said EPA’s decision holds that the waterways in question meet safe drinking water standards, which she said is an “unjustified and dangerous” claim.

“Removing the impairment at the same time Central Iowa had to implement unprecedented water use restrictions made no sense,” Fowle said in the statement. “EPA’s action fails to put the onus on the polluters to adopt practices that will actually fix the problem.”

The environmental groups called for EPA to restore the impaired waters designation and consider their stated concerns as the agency reevaluates Iowa’s impaired waters list.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Raccoon-River-10.2-2048x1536.jpg,N,,2025-10-14 19:02:12.767704

To some of those present at Tuesday’s rally, those moves represented a backslide on Trump’s promises to support coal workers.
Trump is a vocal ally of the coal industry and has taken steps to boost production of the fuel in his first months in office.
“President Trump loves to use coal miners as political props.
But what he really digs is coal industry profits.","Coal miners, their family members and union representatives rallied outside of the U.S. Department of Labor’s headquarters in Washington on Tuesday morning, urging the Trump administration to enforce a rule that was meant to protect miners from serious health complications but has been on hold for months.

The rally, which included members of the National Black Lung Association and the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA), sought to highlight how lax industry standards for exposure to dangerous substances have impacted workers, and demand the government move forward with stricter protections.

A new Biden-era rule, which went into effect in June 2024, was meant to limit miners’ exposure to silica dust, which is released during the mining process. Those tiny silica particles can cause dangerous and irreversible damage to miners’ health, including black lung, silicosis, lung cancer and other diseases.

“If we don’t [enforce the rule], this is just going to be an earlier death sentence for our miners,” said Vonda Robinson, vice president of the National Black Lung Association. “28 years old, 30, 35 years old and passing away—that shouldn’t be.”

The rule requires mining companies to lower exposure limits for silica to half the previously permitted amount. It also requires mine operators to monitor workers’ exposures to silica dust, compel them to provide periodic health examinations at no cost to miners and update standards for respiratory protection.

For Robinson and many of the attendees, the fight is personal. Robinson’s husband was diagnosed with black lung at 47 years old and is now “totally disabled,” Robinson said. Some attendees at the rally carried portable oxygen machines, while others held up pictures of loved ones who had died from the disease.

Black lung has been on the rise in the past 20 years, despite previously having been on the decline since the 1970s. In central Appalachia, the disease now affects one in five miners with 25 years of mining experience, according to the UMWA.

Coal mines were originally required to comply with the new rule by April 14, 2025. However, the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) pushed back that deadline by four months just days before it was set to be implemented, citing the administration’s restructuring of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health as the reason for the pause.

“Given the unforeseen NIOSH restructuring, and other technical reasons, MSHA offers this four-month temporary pause to provide time for operators to secure necessary equipment and otherwise come into compliance,” MSHA said at the time.

Legal challenges filed by industry groups, including the National Stone, Sand & Gravel Association (NSSGA) and the National Mining Association (NMA), prompted the Eighth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to issue a temporary stay halting enforcement of the rule.

In a statement, NMA spokesperson Ashley Burke said that the association is “absolutely supportive of the new lower levels,” but that the rule “needs to allow for the use of administrative controls and personal protective equipment for compliance with the standard to supplement and enhance engineering controls.”

“The MSHA rule must align with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration’s silica rule on methods of compliance,” Burke said, adding that OSHA “has adopted a strict but workable approach to achieve these same silica levels; we are asking for consistency across government.”

Critics have said that those measures—such as rotating shifts and the use of respirators—are insufficient, arguing the practices would only increase the number of workers exposed to the dust and don’t sufficiently protect miners. The rule instead requires mining companies to implement engineering controls, such as ventilation and water sprays, as the primary method to meet lower exposure limits.

MSHA chose not to defend the rule in court, instead asking the Eighth Circuit in August to keep the case on hold as it discusses a potential settlement with the industry groups.

The agency also successfully urged the court to reject attempts by the American Thoracic Society, UMWA and United Steelworkers to intervene in the case in defense of the rule.

The administration has now requested a third delay from the court due to the federal government shutdown.

To some of those present at Tuesday’s rally, those moves represented a backslide on Trump’s promises to support coal workers.

Trump is a vocal ally of the coal industry and has taken steps to boost production of the fuel in his first months in office. The president’s signature One Big Beautiful Bill Act mandated that millions of acres of federal lands be made available for mining, and his administration has consistently sought to prop up the industry in executive and regulatory actions.

“President Trump said we’re going to dig, baby dig,” said Robinson. “OK, we can do that, but let’s take care of the health and safety of our miners.”

“I would ask him—put a pillow over your face, and that’s how these coal miners breathe. They smother every day,” Robinson said.

In an emailed statement, White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said that “President Trump cares deeply about unleashing America’s energy potential, as well as standing up for those who fuel our country, such as hardworking coal miners.”

“Blue collar Americans played a key role in sending President Trump back to the White House because they know he has their back, and with the help of great leaders across the administration … he is working tirelessly to deliver policies that improve the livelihoods of working families across the nation,” Kelly said.

But Jason Walsh, a former Obama administration official and executive director of the BlueGreen Alliance, a coalition of labor unions and environmental organizations, said that Trump’s pro-coal rhetoric represented empty promises to the workers underpinning the industry.

“President Trump loves to use coal miners as political props. But when the cameras are turned off, he couldn’t care less whether they’re sick or healthy,” Walsh said.

“This is a guy who digs coal, loves coal, calls it beautiful. But what he really digs is coal industry profits. He really digs PAC checks from coal company CEOs. He couldn’t care less about miners or the communities they live in.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Coal-Miner-Rally-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-10-14 19:02:09.515575

States are now competing for big data center developments, with many lawmakers and utilities providers seeing them as an economic bonanza. Legislation is promising lucrative financial incentives to big tech companies and easing restrictions on construction, siting and energy infrastructure to power massive computing clusters.

In Louisiana, utilities regulators in August greenlit upward of $3 billion in grid improvements proposed by utilities provider Entergy solely to serve Meta’s largest data center, which requires more than twice the electricity powering New Orleans.

Yet with regulators sidelined from Meta and Entergy’s electricity use contract, consumer advocacy groups and some officials have raised concerns that Louisiana residents will be paying higher electricity bills down the line, as key details about the contract’s terms have been withheld from the public.

As more data centers pop up, demanding massive amounts of electricity and water, lawmakers and regulators are debating how to balance anticipated economic benefits with concerns about how the world’s most powerful corporations may undermine the economic and environmental health of their communities.

With money flooding in, developers are flocking to areas where a lot of data centers are already, like Northern Virginia's Data Center Alley and parts of Texas, according to the IEA.
And in Arizona, some cities have restricted water deliveries to facilities that use a lot of water, including data centers.
Compounding the concerns of data centers' environmental and economic impacts is frustration that tech companies aren't forthcoming about their operations.
Diorio says data center companies are trying to be ""responsible partners"" in the communities where they operate.","Google recently courted the township of Franklin, Ind., so that it could construct a giant campus to house the computer hardware that powers its internet business. But the company needed to rezone more than 450 acres in the Indianapolis suburb, and residents weren't having it.

Many were concerned the facility would consume huge amounts of water and electricity while delivering few local benefits. When a lawyer representing Google confirmed at a September public meeting that the company was pulling its data center proposal, cheers erupted from sign-waving residents.

Similar fights are happening around the United States. On one side are companies pouring billions of dollars into data centers, which increasingly are being built to support artificial intelligence models that promise to transform how people live and work. On the other side are residents who worry the construction spree will have dire consequences for the environment, power prices and surrounding communities.

How tech companies and government officials handle those concerns will shape the industry's future in the U.S. and the country's competitiveness, according to analysts and academics who track the AI industry.

Local opposition ""slowing down the development of the industry or distributing it in sort of weird regional patterns is probably the most overlooked potential outcome in this conversation,"" says Joseph Majkut, director of the energy security and climate change program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

Here's what you need to know about the data center and AI boom — and what's at stake.

What are data centers?

Data centers are big buildings that house computer hardware to store and process digital information. They essentially function as the backbone of the internet. Some of the largest cover more than a million square feet — the size of more than 17 football fields.

When you read this story, or send an email or transfer money from your bank account online, you're relying on data centers scattered around the world.

And that computing power has a big environmental footprint. A typical AI data center uses as much electricity as 100,000 households, and the largest under development will consume 20 times more, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). They also suck up billions of gallons of water for systems to keep all that computer hardware cool.

Why am I hearing so much about data centers right now?

Data centers have been around for decades. But there's an investment frenzy around AI right now that's fueling a construction boom.

That growth is being driven by AI investors seeking enormous profits, thanks to the rising interest in AI from individual consumers and businesses. Within two years of ChatGPT's launch in 2022, for example, around 40% of households in the U.S. and United Kingdom reported using AI chatbots, according to the IEA. Roughly the same share of large companies were using AI last year, up from around 15% in 2020, the agency said.

Tech companies are spending hundreds of billions of dollars on data centers and AI computer chips. They're betting that more people and businesses will use the technology in the future. By 2027, AI is expected to account for 28% of the global data center market, according to Goldman Sachs, more than double its current share.

Where are data centers being built?

With money flooding in, developers are flocking to areas where a lot of data centers are already, like Northern Virginia's Data Center Alley and parts of Texas, according to the IEA. But the agency said there are also signs that development is spreading into other markets, like Las Vegas, that offer affordable land, cheap electricity from renewable power plants and industry tax incentives.

The Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis said this month that ""a potential data center boom is just getting started"" in its district, which covers Minnesota, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota and parts of Michigan and Wisconsin.

""It definitely feels like we are starting to see the rollout of what these massive investments in data centers are potentially going to start to look like on the ground,"" says Melissa Scanlan, director of the Center for Water Policy at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.

What are the benefits of AI?

Artificial intelligence generally refers to computer systems that learn to carry out tasks that traditionally required human intelligence, like reasoning and decision-making, according to NASA.

Some AI is being used to make images and videos online. The IEA says it's also being deployed in the medical field, to rapidly map protein structures for drug development; in the energy industry to quickly detect pipeline leaks and manage electricity networks; and in weather forecasting, to produce more accurate outlooks.

To remain competitive, the U.S. needs to be able to respond to what the market demands, whether it's ""more AI in the form of robotics, or we want much more in the form of digital services to make professionals more productive,"" says Majkut of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""Then there's a variety of applications in the national security, cybersecurity realm where the U.S. having a strong lead in the best [AI] models, the best chips, I think, is also something we want to pursue.""

Does it matter if the data centers that train and run those AI models are located in the U.S.? There are certainly potential economic benefits, like construction jobs and local tax revenue. But some localities are giving up a portion of those payments by offering tax breaks to lure project developers.

""Because much of the upfront investment is about physical infrastructure, having that investment here is hugely beneficial to the American economy,"" says Andrew Chien, a professor of computer science at the University of Chicago and a senior scientist at Argonne National Laboratory. The challenge for communities is figuring out how to turn those initial investments into long-term benefits, Chien adds, like high-paying jobs.

Since it doesn't take many people to operate a data center, once they're built, the facilities don't usually support many permanent jobs.

What's driving the local pushback against data centers?

Some people don't want huge industrial facilities — and all the noise and light that comes with them — changing the character of their community.

But people are also concerned about data centers depleting local water supplies for their cooling systems, driving up electricity bills and worsening climate change if the facilities rely on fossil fuel power plants for the electricity they need. The IEA says climate pollution from the power plants that run data centers could more than double by 2035.

Consider what's happening around the Great Lakes, where Scanlan of the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee says there's a flurry of data center activity. The Great Lakes can be thought of as ""a giant pitcher of water with straws going into it"" from water utilities, business and power plants in eight states and two Canadian provinces, Scanlan says. The question is, how much more water can the lakes provide for data centers and the power plants needed to run them in the coming years?

In Georgia, some residents reported problems getting drinking water from their wells after a data center was built nearby. And in Arizona, some cities have restricted water deliveries to facilities that use a lot of water, including data centers.

Dan Diorio, vice president of state policy at the Data Center Coalition, an industry group, says companies have been working to reduce how much water their facilities consume. While some data centers use evaporative cooling systems in which water is lost as steam, others rely on closed-loop systems that use less water. A Google data center in Georgia uses treated wastewater for cooling and then returns it to the Chattahoochee River, Diorio said. And there's a push for waterless cooling systems.

""It's a balance between water and electricity,"" Diorio says. ""If you use more electricity to cool, you're going to use less water. If you use more water, you'll use less electricity.""

Rising electricity bills are also a major concern as data centers spike power demand in certain areas. An analysis by the Union of Concerned Scientists recently found that in 2024, homes and businesses in Illinois, Maryland, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and West Virginia faced $4.3 billion in additional costs from transmission projects that were needed to deliver power to data centers.

Diorio says the data center industry ""is fully committed to paying its full cost of service for electricity.""

Data centers aren't the only source of new power demand. The construction of factories and increased sales of electric vehicles and home appliances like electric stoves are also increasing the country's electricity needs.

Compounding the concerns of data centers' environmental and economic impacts is frustration that tech companies aren't forthcoming about their operations. Without more transparency around water and energy consumption, Scanlan says the public doesn't have the information it needs to make informed decisions about data center development.

Diorio says data center companies are trying to be ""responsible partners"" in the communities where they operate. But they sometimes worry that sharing information about their water and energy use could give rivals a competitive edge.

Are there other challenges to data center development?

The big challenge is having enough electricity to meet rising demand.

The Trump administration has been taking steps to limit development of renewable energy projects. Industry executives and analysts say renewables are crucial to boost power supplies because the projects can be built quickly, and they generate electricity that is relatively cheap.

Pavan Venkatakrishnan, an infrastructure fellow at the Institute for Progress, says there's a ""clear conflict"" between the administration's position on renewables and its desire to accelerate data center construction.

A White House spokesperson, Kush Desai, said in a statement that AI ""cannot be beholden to unreliable sources of energy that must be heavily subsidized to be economical. The Trump administration is focused on unleashing the forms of energy — from natural gas to nuclear — that do work and that do not need consistent government subsidies to power the next Golden Age for America.""

Solar and wind power coupled with large batteries to store electricity are reliable power sources. There's also widespread agreement among energy analysts and executives that natural gas and nuclear will play an important role in meeting new electricity demand. But they say those technologies can't be deployed quickly enough at scale right now to meet the country's immediate needs.

But there are big energy and environmental risks | Connecticut Public,Michael Copley,,,,,https://www.ctpublic.org/2025-10-14/data-centers-are-booming-but-there-are-big-energy-and-environmental-risks,"Data centers are big buildings that house computer hardware to store and process digital information.
With money flooding in, developers are flocking to areas where a lot of data centers are already, like Northern Virginia's Data Center Alley and parts of Texas, according to the IEA.
And in Arizona, some cities have restricted water deliveries to facilities that use a lot of water, including data centers.
Compounding the concerns of data centers' environmental and economic impacts is frustration that tech companies aren't forthcoming about their operations.
Diorio says data center companies are trying to be ""responsible partners"" in the communities where they operate.","Google recently courted the township of Franklin, Ind., so that it could construct a giant campus to house the computer hardware that powers its internet business. But the company needed to rezone more than 450 acres in the Indianapolis suburb, and residents weren't having it.

Many were concerned the facility would consume huge amounts of water and electricity while delivering few local benefits. When a lawyer representing Google confirmed at a September public meeting that the company was pulling its data center proposal, cheers erupted from sign-waving residents.

Similar fights are happening around the United States. On one side are companies pouring billions of dollars into data centers, which increasingly are being built to support artificial intelligence models that promise to transform how people live and work. On the other side are residents who worry the construction spree will have dire consequences for the environment, power prices and surrounding communities.

How tech companies and government officials handle those concerns will shape the industry's future in the U.S. and the country's competitiveness, according to analysts and academics who track the AI industry.

Local opposition ""slowing down the development of the industry or distributing it in sort of weird regional patterns is probably the most overlooked potential outcome in this conversation,"" says Joseph Majkut, director of the energy security and climate change program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

Here's what you need to know about the data center and AI boom — and what's at stake.

What are data centers?

Data centers are big buildings that house computer hardware to store and process digital information. They essentially function as the backbone of the internet. Some of the largest cover more than a million square feet — the size of more than 17 football fields.

When you read this story, or send an email or transfer money from your bank account online, you're relying on data centers scattered around the world.

And that computing power has a big environmental footprint. A typical AI data center uses as much electricity as 100,000 households, and the largest under development will consume 20 times more, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). They also suck up billions of gallons of water for systems to keep all that computer hardware cool.

Why am I hearing so much about data centers right now?

Data centers have been around for decades. But there's an investment frenzy around AI right now that's fueling a construction boom.

That growth is being driven by AI investors seeking enormous profits, thanks to the rising interest in AI from individual consumers and businesses. Within two years of ChatGPT's launch in 2022, for example, around 40% of households in the U.S. and United Kingdom reported using AI chatbots, according to the IEA. Roughly the same share of large companies were using AI last year, up from around 15% in 2020, the agency said.

Tech companies are spending hundreds of billions of dollars on data centers and AI computer chips. They're betting that more people and businesses will use the technology in the future. By 2027, AI is expected to account for 28% of the global data center market, according to Goldman Sachs, more than double its current share.

Where are data centers being built?

With money flooding in, developers are flocking to areas where a lot of data centers are already, like Northern Virginia's Data Center Alley and parts of Texas, according to the IEA. But the agency said there are also signs that development is spreading into other markets, like Las Vegas, that offer affordable land, cheap electricity from renewable power plants and industry tax incentives.

The Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis said this month that ""a potential data center boom is just getting started"" in its district, which covers Minnesota, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota and parts of Michigan and Wisconsin.

""It definitely feels like we are starting to see the rollout of what these massive investments in data centers are potentially going to start to look like on the ground,"" says Melissa Scanlan, director of the Center for Water Policy at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.

What are the benefits of AI?

Artificial intelligence generally refers to computer systems that learn to carry out tasks that traditionally required human intelligence, like reasoning and decision-making, according to NASA.

Some AI is being used to make images and videos online. The IEA says it's also being deployed in the medical field, to rapidly map protein structures for drug development; in the energy industry to quickly detect pipeline leaks and manage electricity networks; and in weather forecasting, to produce more accurate outlooks.

To remain competitive, the U.S. needs to be able to respond to what the market demands, whether it's ""more AI in the form of robotics, or we want much more in the form of digital services to make professionals more productive,"" says Majkut of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""Then there's a variety of applications in the national security, cybersecurity realm where the U.S. having a strong lead in the best [AI] models, the best chips, I think, is also something we want to pursue.""

Does it matter if the data centers that train and run those AI models are located in the U.S.? There are certainly potential economic benefits, like construction jobs and local tax revenue. But some localities are giving up a portion of those payments by offering tax breaks to lure project developers.

""Because much of the upfront investment is about physical infrastructure, having that investment here is hugely beneficial to the American economy,"" says Andrew Chien, a professor of computer science at the University of Chicago and a senior scientist at Argonne National Laboratory. The challenge for communities is figuring out how to turn those initial investments into long-term benefits, Chien adds, like high-paying jobs.

Since it doesn't take many people to operate a data center, once they're built, the facilities don't usually support many permanent jobs.

What's driving the local pushback against data centers?

Some people don't want huge industrial facilities — and all the noise and light that comes with them — changing the character of their community.

But people are also concerned about data centers depleting local water supplies for their cooling systems, driving up electricity bills and worsening climate change if the facilities rely on fossil fuel power plants for the electricity they need. The IEA says climate pollution from the power plants that run data centers could more than double by 2035.

Consider what's happening around the Great Lakes, where Scanlan of the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee says there's a flurry of data center activity. The Great Lakes can be thought of as ""a giant pitcher of water with straws going into it"" from water utilities, business and power plants in eight states and two Canadian provinces, Scanlan says. The question is, how much more water can the lakes provide for data centers and the power plants needed to run them in the coming years?

In Georgia, some residents reported problems getting drinking water from their wells after a data center was built nearby. And in Arizona, some cities have restricted water deliveries to facilities that use a lot of water, including data centers.

Dan Diorio, vice president of state policy at the Data Center Coalition, an industry group, says companies have been working to reduce how much water their facilities consume. While some data centers use evaporative cooling systems in which water is lost as steam, others rely on closed-loop systems that use less water. A Google data center in Georgia uses treated wastewater for cooling and then returns it to the Chattahoochee River, Diorio said. And there's a push for waterless cooling systems.

""It's a balance between water and electricity,"" Diorio says. ""If you use more electricity to cool, you're going to use less water. If you use more water, you'll use less electricity.""

Rising electricity bills are also a major concern as data centers spike power demand in certain areas. An analysis by the Union of Concerned Scientists recently found that in 2024, homes and businesses in Illinois, Maryland, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and West Virginia faced $4.3 billion in additional costs from transmission projects that were needed to deliver power to data centers.

Diorio says the data center industry ""is fully committed to paying its full cost of service for electricity.""

Data centers aren't the only source of new power demand. The construction of factories and increased sales of electric vehicles and home appliances like electric stoves are also increasing the country's electricity needs.

U.S. demand for EVs had already started to drop early last year, but it’s now expected to really crater under President Donald Trump’s policies targeting the market.
The biggest blow is the end of the federal $7,500 EV tax credit, which officially expired on Sept. 30.
“I wouldn’t be surprised if EV sales in the US go down to 5%,” Farley told the audience, according to Bloomberg.
He said Ford is already looking to retool its battery and EV plants to include hybrid production.","The sinking demand for electric vehicles (EVs) is starting to take a hit on car manufacturers. In recent years, carmakers have made major investments, betting on electric cars becoming more mainstream, as well as to meet government regulations, but recent shifts in policy and politics have now made those bets costly.

General Motors is the latest company to show how this change is hitting its bottom line. The company said today, in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), that it would take a $1.6 billion hit on its quarterly earnings ending Sept. 30. The charge stems mostly from a drop in the value of its plants and equipment tied to its EV operations along with $400 million in fees and settlements related to canceling supplier contracts associated with EV investments.

“Following recent U.S. Government policy changes, including the termination of certain consumer tax incentives for EV purchases and the reduction in the stringency of emissions regulations, we expect the adoption rate of EVs to slow,” the company said.

U.S. demand for EVs had already started to drop early last year, but it’s now expected to really crater under President Donald Trump’s policies targeting the market. The biggest blow is the end of the federal $7,500 EV tax credit, which officially expired on Sept. 30. That incentive was scrapped under the administration’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

But the loss of subsidies isn’t the industry’s only hurdle. Earlier this year, Trump rolled back federal emissions standards and stripped states of the ability to set their own stricter rules. That move wiped out California and other states’ requirements that automakers sell more zero-emission vehicles.

The EV industry also faces cultural and consumer challenges. Elon Musk’s growing unpopularity has turned off some buyers, potentially dragging down demand not only for Teslas but for EVs in general.

GM said a “reassessment of our E.V. capacity and manufacturing footprint” is ongoing and could lead to even more costs in the future.

GM isn’t the only company bracing for an EV slowdown. Car companies like Nissan, Honda, and Ford are shifting their strategies, delaying launches and quietly shifting money back into internal combustion vehicles.

Just weeks ago, Ford CEO Jim Farley said at the Ford Pro Accelerate conference in Detroit that EV sales in the U.S. could be slashed in half in the foreseeable future.

“I wouldn’t be surprised if EV sales in the US go down to 5%,” Farley told the audience, according to Bloomberg. EVs currently account for nearly 10% of the broader domestic market.

For his part, Farley thinks the industry should move toward “partial electrification” with more hybrid options. In his view, fully electric models make the most sense as commuter vehicles with short drives, accounting for only about 5% to 7% of the market. He said Ford is already looking to retool its battery and EV plants to include hybrid production.",https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2023/04/fad5f85887158b277f178d99bf80d9af.jpg,N,,2025-10-14 19:02:16.802553

U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat representing Rhode Island, held a roundtable in Raleigh on Tuesday to address climate change driving up insurance costs.

Speaking at the Walnut Creek Wetlands Center, Whitehouse joined U.S. Rep. Deborah Ross (NC-02), the North Carolina League of Conservation Voters and Partners for Environmental Justice to address concerns from local experts, community leaders and residents.

Whitehouse is in his fourth term in the Senate. He has served as the ranking member of the Committee on Environment and Public Works since January 2025.

Whitehouse said his home state of Rhode Island faces some of the same environmental challenges as North Carolina. Rhode Island is subject to rain bursts — sudden amounts of precipitation in a short period of time — that can flood rivers and overwhelm sewage treatment facilities. The Ocean State also has rising sea levels, coastal storms, and erosion.

“Those are familiar topics to you here in North Carolina – upland river flooding from rain bursts and coastal erosion and storms tearing away at your coastal communities,” Whitehouse said.

Flooding, storm water, and storm control are familiar issues to Ross’s constituents in the second congressional district, she said, but they are less common in other parts of the state.

She referenced Hurricane Helene sweeping through western North Carolina last year and sending floodwaters through the mountainous terrain at an unprecedented level.

“It is a new [issue] to the North Carolina mountains and to many other areas in this country that are feeling the effects of climate change that have been spreading and worsening over time,” Ross said.

This raises costs for homeowners insurance, according to Whitehouse. He talked about insurance companies deeming properties too risky due to concerns with climate change, which then leads to increased rates for families.

A poll found that 92% of voters in Texas are worried about the costs of their home insurance rising due to severe weather like hurricanes and flooding, Whitehouse said, referencing a roundtable he held in Houston in August.

“This is actually everywhere, and it opens a new era of a climate conversation that will give us the political power to solve the problem before it gets devastatingly worse,” he said.

Dan Crawford, senior director of public affairs at the NCLCV, said North Carolina is on the front lines of this conversation. He said the state now has the third highest rate of property insurance policy cancellations in the country.

In some coastal counties, more than one in 10 homeowners lost their coverage in 2023, he said.

“The message is clear: You can’t solve the insurance crisis without also addressing the climate crisis,” Crawford said. “Rising risk means rising cost, and unless we take action to make our communities more resilient and reduce the pollution driving these disasters, North Carolinians will continue to pay that price.”

State Commissioner of Insurance Mike Causey didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on the issue.

Community members at the roundtable shared stories of losing a business in Chapel Hill due to flooding and neighborhoods being destroyed from Tropical Storm Chantal in July.

Others expressed concerns over policy, especially with cuts to resources like the National Weather Service, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and the National Flood Insurance Program.

Whitehouse said the NFIP “isn’t sound or fair now” and needs restructuring. Improvements should include better mapping, allowing people to know when they’re really at risk, and options for people to be able to get assistance to relocate before they have to rebuild their homes, he said.

“The whole program is failing right now, and so a very significant redo is required, but transparency and consumer options are two of the key pieces to make it right,” he told NC Newsline.",https://media.zenfs.com/en/nc_newsline_articles_683/3fc95e5b5825e65b016e974c63cc875b,N,,2025-10-14 20:03:18.659962

Learning From China’s Nuclear Licensing Unlike the United States, China employs a state-led national strategy to allocate resources and plan future infrastructure projects.
While Chinese nuclear finance is diversifying, the debt ratio of Chinese nuclear projects is around 70% to 80%, at interest rates as low as 1.4%--far lower rates than companies in other nations can secure.
For nuclear construction workers, the U.S. should retrain and mobilize skilled labor from adjacent heavy industries if possible.
Context China’s recent success in constructing nuclear reactors follows years of work to build a full nuclear industrial ecosystem.","While the United States generates the most nuclear energy globally, China is far ahead when it comes to the construction of new nuclear reactors. There is currently 35GW of generation, or 30 nuclear plants, being constructed in China—more than the rest of the world combined. But China is not just winning in terms of scale; it is leading in advanced technology deployment as well. China’s Linglong-1, or ACP-100, is the world’s first commercial small modular reactor (SMR) that has passed the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) general safety review and is expected to be connected to the grid by the end of 2025.

In contrast, the United States has delivered little new nuclear capacity in the last three decades, and its most recent projects, Vogtle Units 3 and 4, faced massive delays and cost overruns.

There is consensus about how China has been able to build new nuclear faster than the rest of the world—industrial supply chain capacity combined with top-down strategic policy has dramatically expedited the growth of the Chinese nuclear industry. For nuclear supporters in the United States, there is also a consensus that the U.S. must learn from Chinese success. But, what lessons can be drawn? And, where will the U.S. need to pursue alternative strategies to accelerate nuclear deployment safely and effectively?

Some elements of China’s success—its top-down policy-making, direct public financing of new reactors, and low construction labor costs—are not likely to be repeatable, or even attractive, for the American nuclear industry. However, the United States can learn from China’s predictable licensing pathways, healthy support for financing, and focus on modular construction practices. Ultimately, China and the United States have dramatically different political economies, and what works in one place might not work in the other, but China’s success offers invaluable insights for the American nuclear industry to scale.

Learning From China’s Nuclear Licensing

Unlike the United States, China employs a state-led national strategy to allocate resources and plan future infrastructure projects. Whereas the U.S. nuclear sector is made up of private developers seeking license approval from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), every nuclear plant built in China is included in the “national strategy” ahead of its licensing and permitting process. When a nuclear project is proposed in China, a state-owned enterprise (SOE) establishes a subsidiary with the sole task of constructing the project and then operating the reactor. To date, China has never cancelled or denied a nuclear project after the State Council approved it as part of the national strategy.

Such a top-down approach to nuclear licensing is obviously impossible in the United States. There is no American national strategy that dictates the next 5 or 10 years of infrastructure construction. However, certain practices of Chinese nuclear licensing and regulation can be and should be adapted and applied in the U.S.

Technology-inclusive rulemaking

While first-of-a-kind (FOAK) reactor builds are notoriously difficult to license anywhere in the world. China’s licensing regulations are generalized enough to accommodate technological development. The safety review regulation for reactor licensing is only 13 pages, and the regulatory framework for nuclear facility design totals 62 pages. The Chinese National Nuclear Safety Administration (NNSA) reviews the application on a case-by-case basis, which does not force projects to jump through hoops that only apply to other technologies. Advanced reactor applicants have a slightly different application form from more traditional reactors, and do not need to demonstrate how their reactors are safe in contexts that are only applicable to older, larger reactors. Ultimately, the Chinese NNSA understands that advanced reactors are typically far safer, and should not be forced to demonstrate unnecessary safety steps during licensing.

On the other hand, the United States’ Nuclear Regulatory Commission’s (NRC) licensing pathways, mainly 10 CFR Parts 52 and 50, both over 100 pages, were designed for traditional nuclear reactors originally built over half a century ago. This forces advanced reactor applicants to seek exemptions under these rules, requiring extra effort from both the applicant and the NRC staff and causing unnecessary delays.

Improving licensing of advanced reactors is already a priority in the U.S. context. The NRC is finalizing its Part 53 rulemaking to be risk-informed, technology-neutral, and performance-based. Part 53 will be the best of a “case-by-case” approach due to flexible performance objectives, while licensing decisions can be referenced in the future to speed things up. It is imperative to make Part 53 as predictable and flexible as the Chinese regulatory framework, such as allowing for alternative quality assurance programs, accepting flexible risk evaluation methodology other than Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA), to be more compatible with Parts 50 and 52. The NRC must make Part 53 a clear, modern, and usable pathway to enable the efficient and timely licensing in the United States.

Predictability and Timeliness

While licensing might appear to be more streamlined and smoother in China than in the U.S., the Chinese nuclear licensing process is actually more complicated and bureaucratic. National strategy-making does offer more predictability that a project will ultimately be approved, but investors and developers must still wait years for final approval. For example, it took 18 years for the Gen IV reactor, Shidaowan, to go from proposal to operation (See Figure 1). Still, the licensing process was predictable enough that the project crew was prepared to start construction—known in the industry as reaching “first concrete day” or FCD—immediately after local State Council approval and the issuance of the construction permit from the national government.

19 out of the 30 (63%) Chinese nuclear plants that are currently under construction broke ground (i.e., reached FCD) within a couple of weeks of the issuance of a national construction permit or approval from the State Council, whichever arrives later. This indicates a much more streamlined—albeit not the fastest—licensing approach that does not leave developers in a licensing purgatory when a national regulatory agency approves a project, but a local agency does not, or vice versa.

Meanwhile, in the United States, approval from a state Public Utility Commission (PUC) can take months or even years after receiving a construction permit from the NRC. PUCs need to sign off on the final authorization to start a project, but they often don’t begin review until the project receives NRC approval, creating a licensing lag before FCD. Also, after the final approval, projects in the United States struggle to hire and mobilize thousands of workers. For example, Kairos received its construction permit for Hermes in December 2023 but could not break ground until July 2024. Similarly, Vogtle received its construction permit from the NRC in February 2012, but FCD for both reactors was not until 2013.

While some of the predictability of China’s nuclear licensing depends on continued top-down planning that is unique to the Chinese case, other aspects, like communication between national regulators and the State Councils, and between investors, developers, local communities, and other stakeholders, can be modified into American nuclear licensing to help promote efficiency and predictability.

To promote better predictability in the U.S. context, the NRC and PUCs should work together to issue construction permits and project authorizations in tandem. The NRC can also accelerate efficiency by fully implementing the performance-based Part 53 rule, streamlining environmental review, and removing uncontested mandatory hearings. Even if the NRC can take these steps, the U.S. nuclear licensing regime will likely be less predictable than China’s, but it can definitely be more efficient and faster. States have also started to streamline permitting by creating offices to consolidate processes and accelerate local approvals.

Lessons from Lower Rate Financing

In China, large SOEs are responsible for the construction and operation of nuclear power plants, which they do through a joint venture with local utilities, other electricity companies, or universities, depending on the specific project. In this way, SOEs can leverage more capital to build more projects with financial risks shared by other stakeholders. Crucially, these projects benefit from state-bank financing with low interest rates. While Chinese nuclear finance is diversifying, the debt ratio of Chinese nuclear projects is around 70% to 80%, at interest rates as low as 1.4%--far lower rates than companies in other nations can secure. China National Nuclear Corporation’s (CNNC) average cost of debt is 3-4%, and the floating rate could go down with a further decrease of the national loan prime rate set by the People’s Bank of China.

In the United States, financing cost is a huge barrier for nuclear projects. Financing cost for a nuclear plant refers to the total expense of debt and equity financing, and the interest rate is highly correlated with the cost of debt. Because nuclear projects require massive upfront investment and long construction timelines, borrowing costs can account for up to two-thirds of a project's total cost when the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is as high as 9%. Lowering the cost of capital is therefore critical to attract new investors and to assuage developers’ and utilities’ concerns about financial and construction risk.

While the U.S. cannot offer the state ownership structures, milestone-based financing incentives that incrementally reduce interest rates when project milestones are achieved on time can encourage timely project completion and help nuclear developers to establish an orderbook. The Department of Energy’s Loan Program Office (LPO) can provide loan guarantees and create a precedent for the private sector to follow. Coupled with investment tax credit (ITC), a milestone-based program could reduce financial risk while respecting market structures and private-sector decision-making. What’s more, state-level policy can step in by switching to Clean Energy Stands to make nuclear eligible for low-interest financing programs.

Taking Cues from Chinese Construction Approaches

Core Designs and Modular Construction

To reach nuclear at scale, China chose to build multiple types of reactor technologies, while developing a “core design” for each reactor type to better build the Nth-of-a-kind via “learning-by-doing”. For example, China has built and improved the Hualong One (HPR-1000) design over 10 domestic reactor builds, plus multiple overseas, while simultaneously building two CAP-1400 reactors with plans to build more in the future. For SMRs, China recognizes the value of modular construction and has already fabricated an integrated module for the Linglong-1 project, an important step toward making future SMR production resemble an automated assembly line.

A standardized “core design” can avoid inconsistent fuel and parts supply and reduce redundant workforce training, and streamline licensing reviews, which improves industry safety standards and reduces costs. China’s nuclear planner witnessed how nuclear power pioneers, such as the United States and Russia, used inconsistent reactor designs for nuclear power, which ultimately increased construction and operation costs, and made each project FOAK.

But, instead of choosing a single “core design” and trying to build as many of that reactor type as possible, the Chinese nuclear industry has developed a “core design” for multiple reactor technologies that can fit the needs of different locations and needs. According to a report by Orient Securities, “The same model should be built in batches of about 6 to 10 units to maximize industry benefits.” To enhance this strategy, China is gradually building up a nuclear supply chain with a focus on making the main components of its reactors domestically. Over the past two decades, China has prioritized domestic manufacturing of key reactor components, increasing local content from about 50% in the early 2000s to over 90%.

For the United States, it is unrealistic for the government to focus on one or even just a couple of advanced nuclear technologies. However, with the correct incentives, the market will naturally filter the most successful standardized designs. The US already has a “core design” for the AP-1000, and can adopt a more modular approach focused on iterative improvement. Modular assembly can reduce construction costs and improve efficiency without relying on overworked labor. To support this strategy, the United States should strengthen the domestic supply chain through subsidies or targeted policy levers. At the same time, restrictions on imported fuels or critical components could slow industry growth and increase uncertainty for actual nuclear deployment.

Intensive Labor and Workforce

The workforce is the backbone of China’s nuclear deployment speed. Typical construction workers are usually in their early 20s with a limited educational background who work long hours. Multiple shifts—including night shifts—are the norm during construction, especially immediately following FCD. Labor in China is relatively cheap, reducing costs for nuclear developers, and laborers often work under minimal labor regulations. For example, during the construction of Tianwan Station in 2023, workers had to move materials at night to maintain continuous progress. 900 workers stayed on-site through the Chinese New Year, the country’s most important national holiday, to complete the dome lift on schedule.

Nuclear plant construction in China and the United States is equally labor-intensive. At peak construction, Vogtle 3 and 4 had more than 9,000 workers on site, similar to large Chinese projects, but at a significantly higher cost. A nuclear construction worker in the United States earns roughly $80,000 per year, while a similar worker in China only earns around ¥80,000 (~$12,000).

However, the US workers are more protected through unions. The U.S. nuclear industry employs roughly 19% unionized labor—one of the highest unionized rates among all energy sources in the U.S. Overseen by the NRC and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), the U.S. nuclear workforce has collective bargaining rights, regulated working hours, and enforceable workplace standards, and does not work the same extended shifts as its Chinese counterparts.

American nuclear developers should not seek to replicate the low-cost, high-risk labor practices found in China. For nuclear construction workers, the U.S. should retrain and mobilize skilled labor from adjacent heavy industries if possible. In the meantime, the U.S. should focus on expanding operational nuclear workforce pipelines through apprenticeships and university programs that bring in high-skill, efficient workers who can help expedite construction and further improve American reactor builds. Cultivating a new generation of licensed operators, reactor engineers, and maintenance specialists will be critical to sustaining long-term plant performance and reliability.

International Partnerships

Over the past decade, China has been exporting its nuclear technology as part of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). China has already constructed six reactors in Pakistan and plans to build around 30 overseas reactors by 2030. China’s nuclear exports accelerate its construction learning curve for developers by allowing for more projects in the short term. It also strengthens China’s global nuclear presence, builds diplomatic and commercial relationships, and creates opportunities for learning and standardizing reactor designs across multiple countries.

Building cooperative relationships with Western allies, such as the UK and France, can help American nuclear developers in ways other than exporting reactors. The US can strengthen multilateral nuclear partnerships and diversify the nuclear supply chain, such as by collaborating with the U.K. or France to access their established nuclear fuel recycling capabilities. In the long run, the U.S. should aim to export more reactors, which can similarly expand U.S. construction experience and drive down the future cost for US domestic nuclear deployment. In this way, the U.S. will be a more appealing partner for other countries, both for purchasing reactor designs and for expanding broader nuclear cooperation.

Adapting to the U.S. Context

China’s recent success in constructing nuclear reactors follows years of work to build a full nuclear industrial ecosystem. Planners accepted that early projects would be difficult and costly, but committed to pushing through, and now, China benefits from faster builds and lower costs.

The U.S. can’t replicate this overnight, but it must invest in developing its own nuclear ecosystem at every layer. Trump’s May executive orders calling for NRC reform, streamlined environmental reviews, more efficient licensing, and the deployment of 300GW of new nuclear energy by 2050 are a good start, but the US needs thorough support from coordinated policy, capital, and institutional resources. Specifically, the US needs to:

Create a predictable and efficient regulatory framework

Generate national-level demand for new nuclear plants by committing to purchase electricity through long-term market contracts, providing developers with firm orders and revenue certainty

Incentivize timely project completion through milestone-based financing mechanisms

Seek “core designs” and improve through iterative production, and promote modular construction practices

Develop a skilled, resilient workforce through training programs and university pipelines

SPP contends the provisional load process will encourage generation resources to be built, according to the grid operator’s application.

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on Friday approved a Southwest Power Pool proposal — called the “provisional load process” — that will let the grid operator study potential data centers and other load additions even when there isn’t available power to serve the new facilities.

SPP’s proposed process “will facilitate transmission customers’ efforts to appropriately and more expeditiously plan to serve their future loads,” FERC said.

Recently, SPP has been unable to study many transmission customers’ requests for load additions because they lacked power supplies to cover their 10-year load forecast, including the load addition — a requirement under the grid operator’s rules for load interconnection studies to move ahead, the grid operator said in its June 4 proposal at FERC.

Under the approved provisional load process, SPP will consider a transmission customer’s planned generation when studying a request to add load. The process will give transmission customers time to procure firm transmission service for planned generation needed to serve new load, according to the grid operator.

SPP contends the provisional load process will encourage generation resources to be built, according to the grid operator’s application. Also, the process may attract other load interconnection customers to the SPP region, the grid operator said.

SPP runs the power grid and wholesale electricity markets across parts of 14 states from Texas to North Dakota.

Under the provisional load process, the costs of network upgrades needed to interconnect new load will be assigned to the transmission customer until planned generation has been included in the transmission customer’s transmission service agreement, according to FERC. After that, any remaining network upgrade costs will be rolled into zonal or regional rates.

The cost allocation plan protects transmission customers from paying for network upgrades for generating resources that change from the original plan or that don’t get built, according to SPP.

Separately, SPP is advancing a 90-day interconnection study process for “high impact large load” that will be paired with new generation or for interconnecting large loads with current or planned generation. The policy, approved by SPP’s board last month, will require FERC approval.

Like other grid operators, SPP has seen a jump in requested load additions, including large loads like data centers and manufacturing plants, according to the grid operator.

Since 2020, SPP has received 26.4 GW of load interconnection requests larger than 100 MW, including 9 GW disclosed as data centers, the grid operator said in its proposal at FERC.

Manufacturers are faced with a problem: they have a nice new battery supply chain all charged up, with not enough electric cars to power.

“If you stood up these factories, you want to keep them producing,” said Jay Whitacre, a professor of energy engineering and policy at Carnegie Mellon university.

He said battery producers and suppliers that were focused on cars can fairly easily switch to making batteries that hold electricity for the grid.

“They can use the same production line, typically, to make these cells,” Whitacre said.

Stationary batteries are needed to store renewable energy from wind and solar that’s generated intermittently. But they’re also increasingly in demand for data centers.

“They want these plants to be reliable, and so regardless of where the power is coming from, whether it's coming from renewables or coming from burning coal, they're all installing energy storage systems to provide backup power,” said Sam Abuelsamid, an analyst at Telemetry market research.

He pointed to EV battery maker LG which already converted one of its major U.S. production facilities to grid storage.

“And I wouldn't be surprised to see some other plants that have excess capacity follow a similar path,” said Abuelsamid.

Even the annual Battery Show held in Detroit last week had a different flavor according to Mickael Havelle at the battery materials supplier Arkema. Where in the past, car batteries were the belle of the ball.

Arkema sells specialized coatings and binders for lithium-ion batteries, whether they’re in cars or stationary.

The financial exposure treatment significantly raised the share of subjects supporting the Abundance approach.","On October 9, 2025, FSI Senior Fellow Saumitra Jha presented his team’s research on how exposure to financial markets — meaning individuals’ exposure to tailored opportunities to directly engage with investment platforms and decision-making — can increase support for action on climate change. This CDDRL research seminar expanded on Jha’s earlier research on the effects of financial exposure and literacy as tools for reducing political polarization, including studies conducted in Israel, Mexico, and the United Kingdom.

During the seminar, Jha highlighted the study's relevance in an era of democratic backsliding, rising populism on both the right and the left, and increasing economic uncertainty. Jha emphasized that basic financial literacy — the ability to understand and practically apply financial concepts such as saving, investing, and diversifying risks— is essential for citizens navigating this environment. Jha’s team designed interventions that empower citizens, both in rich and poor countries, to build financial knowledge and, by focusing on common investments and the common good, ultimately mitigate political polarization and conflict.

The study focused on the partisan issue of climate change in the United States. Participants were oversampled from states either disproportionately affected by climate change or central to the green-energy transition — Pennsylvania, West Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Georgia, Alabama, Arizona, Ohio, South Carolina, and Kentucky. Each participant in the treatment group initially received an investment portfolio that tracked stocks from either green energy companies (firms at the forefront of the transition, engaged in renewable energy like solar and wind) or brown energy companies (firms earlier in the transition, engaged in the extraction of fossil fuels such as oil and natural gas). Subjects had $50–$100 of real money or a virtual portfolio of funds to invest.

For five weeks, participants used a Robinhood-style investment platform (a simple online interface for buying and selling stocks) to trade their stocks. Midway through the study, they were able to trade across both green and brown stocks. At this point, they received additional financial disclosures (basic company performance data) and had access to climate-impact disclosures (data on companies' greenhouse gas emissions and how they affect or are affected by climate change). However, this is currently a central policy debate; very few participants actually chose to review climate disclosures, which Jha identified as a research question for a companion paper. The research team then evaluated results in four categories: (1) beliefs about human agency and tradeoffs with the green energy transition, (2) policy preferences, (3) political attitudes, and (4) personal behaviors.

The data demonstrated that this financial exposure treatment — i.e., hands-on stock trading experience — had a significant, meaningful, and lasting influence on participants’ beliefs. Relative to control, treated participants were 9% more likely to agree or strongly agree that human activity is a significant contributor to climate change. They further became more supportive of both government and corporate action to mitigate climate change, and came to view the green-energy transition as potentially economically beneficial.

Further, the intervention was empowering, raising the financial literacy of participants and increasing their ongoing consumption of financial news outlets, rather than social media or Fox News. These effects were observable even eight months after the study.

Further, these changes were not preaching to the choir — instead, the effects were observed across the political spectrum, particularly among those who were ex ante climate change skeptics. However, while treated participants were more likely to donate to climate causes and to consider climate when investing and working, they did not report an overall increased willingness to change their daily lives. For example, while reporting an increased willingness to reuse recyclable bags, most did not report an increased willingness to change ingrained daily habits, such as eating less meat or changing commute patterns.

Jha also previewed new results from a companion paper based on a long-term survey conducted 8 months after treatment. To examine how the treatment changes how participants preferred climate action to be implemented, the research team gauged support for two approaches: the “Abundance approach”, popularized by Ezra Klein, and the “Conservation and Regulation approach.” The Abundance approach emphasizes expanding investments in clean energy infrastructure, sustainable housing, and economic growth as solutions to climate change. By contrast, the Conservation and Regulation approach focuses on reducing energy use through government regulation, strong local autonomy, and personal restraint. The financial exposure treatment significantly raised the share of subjects supporting the Abundance approach.",https://fsi9-prod.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/styles/1200x630/public/2025-10/saum_seminar_2025.jpg?itok=BT1_OcLm,N,,2025-10-14 18:03:24.713977

That endangers not just sustainability but also agriculture itself, which will suffer from climate impacts,” Mr. Tatto warned.
The environmental caucus believes that the anti-environmental agenda harms Brazil’s international image.
It leaves us in a contradictory position as COP host,” Mr. Tatto said.
According to ministry sources, efforts have focused on defending the environmental licensing framework from setbacks, leaving “little room” for advancing new positive initiatives.","The leadership of both the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate declined to comment. Behind the scenes, however, lawmakers say the polarized political climate has made it difficult to advance a constructive legislative agenda.

According to Nilto Tatto (Workers’ Party, PT, São Paulo), coordinator of the Joint Parliamentary Front for the Environment, there is a disconnect between the urgency of the climate crisis and Congress’s actions.

“While the government works to show results in reducing deforestation and seeks international financial support, Congress moves in the opposite direction, prioritizing regulatory rollbacks such as relaxed licensing and land regularization,” Mr. Tatto said.

For Suely Araújo, policy coordinator at the Observatório do Clima, the vote on the licensing vetoes—scheduled for Thursday (16)—is particularly worrisome.

“The farm caucus is expected to fight for the vetoes’ overturn. Another red flag is the Foreign Affairs Committee’s rejection of the Escazú Agreement,” she noted. Signed in New York in 2018, the Escazú Agreement is the first environmental treaty in Latin America and the Caribbean to guarantee access to information, justice, and protection for environmental defenders. Although Brazil signed it, congressional ratification is still pending.

The bill’s rapporteur, Congressman Evair Vieira de Melo (Progressives Party, PP, Espírito Santo), recommended rejecting the treaty, citing “practical implications and potential risks to national sovereignty and Brazil’s economic interests.”

“It’s extremely rare for Congress to reject an international agreement,” Mr. Araújo explained. “It reflects pressure from the ruralist bloc, criticism of environmental regulation, and fears about transparency—for instance, concerns that rural property data could become publicly available.”

Environmentalists are prioritizing the preservation of the presidential vetoes this week, though the likelihood of their being overturned is high. “If Congress overturns them, the only recourse will be to challenge the law before the Supreme Court through a direct action of unconstitutionality,” said Mr. Araújo.

Mr. Tatto attributes the lack of progress to the influence of the ruralist bloc—aligned with conservatives and the political center—and to polarization ahead of the municipal elections. “Today’s Congress is out of sync with the climate crisis,” he argued.

He noted that 2024 saw some positive developments, including the regulation of carbon markets, biofuels, and energy transition, often with support from agribusiness lawmakers.

“This year, however, there’s no long-term perspective—only short-term political interests. That endangers not just sustainability but also agriculture itself, which will suffer from climate impacts,” Mr. Tatto warned.

The environmental caucus believes that the anti-environmental agenda harms Brazil’s international image. “Congress undermines Brazil’s climate diplomacy. International observers interpret our votes as the country’s position, regardless of the government’s efforts in multilateral negotiations. It leaves us in a contradictory position as COP host,” Mr. Tatto said.

In March, Environment Minister Marina Silva met with 30 lawmakers to align a legislative strategy for COP30, but little progress has been made. According to ministry sources, efforts have focused on defending the environmental licensing framework from setbacks, leaving “little room” for advancing new positive initiatives.

Mr. Tatto said he plans to ask Chamber President Hugo Motta (Republicans of Paraíba) to bring at least a few pro-environment bills to the floor before the summit.

The 2025 Legislative Agenda, published by the Observatório do Clima and backed by 22 environmental organizations, identifies a “destruction package” of bills that could severely harm ecosystems, traditional peoples’ rights, and Brazil’s climate targets. These include measures that weaken licensing and land laws, alter the Forest Code and the Atlantic Forest Law, and even allow privatization of coastal zones.

On the positive side, environmentalists hope to advance proposals such as the Law of the Sea (creating a national marine conservation policy), the Circular Economy Bill (setting plastic reduction and recycling targets while compensating waste pickers), and the National Policy for Biodiversity Economy (PNDEB).

Other key proposals include a constitutional amendment recognizing climate security as a fundamental right, tougher penalties for environmental crimes, and the Agenda 2030 Bill, which aligns national policy with the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).",https://s2-valorinternational.glbimg.com/5D2wh42NsJ8hT5DfHWm0njVTlbw=/1200x/smart/filters:cover():strip_icc()/i.s3.glbimg.com/v1/AUTH_37554604729d4b2f9f3eb9ad8a691345/internal_photos/bs/2025/l/y/ZiNlXSTkeHgwPKntcZzQ/resexituxi45.jpg,N,,2025-10-14 21:59:49.387129

Kathy Hochul’s signature, and Massachusetts, are also viewed as contenders to do so in 2025, CFO Dive previously reported.
Michigan’s legislation (HB 4893) was first introduced last month by state Rep. Mark Tisdel, who chairs the House Finance Committee.
MICPA is hoping to get the bill heard by the Finance Committee as early as next week.
The 22 states that have put CPA pathways laws in place to date this year are: Ohio, Virginia, Utah, Indiana, New Mexico, Iowa, Texas, Georgia, South Carolina, Tennessee, Minnesota, Montana, Oregon, Nevada, Hawaii, Alaska, Illinois, Connecticut, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Delaware and California.","In the wake of a recent 11th hour agreement averting a Michigan budget crisis, proponents of the state’s certified public accountant licensure reform bill want to see similar just-in-time action pushing the CPA legislation to passage by year-end.

“This year, that’s the hope,” Bob Doyle, CEO of the Michigan Association of Certified Public Accountants, said in an interview, noting that he anticipates that the resolution of the budget should help free up lawmakers to move forward with other legislation such as the CPA reform bill.

If that timing is realized, Michigan could help bring closer to the halfway mark the number of states that have put CPA pathways bills on the books this yearwhich set up new rules that don’t require candidates to complete 150 hours of college credits, effectively a fifth year of college, to become certified. New York, where the legislation is still awaiting Gov. Kathy Hochul’s signature, and Massachusetts, are also viewed as contenders to do so in 2025, CFO Dive previously reported.

Michigan’s legislation (HB 4893) was first introduced last month by state Rep. Mark Tisdel, who chairs the House Finance Committee.

MICPA is hoping to get the bill heard by the Finance Committee as early as next week. But there’s a wrinkle: Doyle said the original bill needs to be amended to align with the industry’s Uniform Accountancy Act that many states are using as a legislative guideline as well as to fix details related to the years of experience needed by candidates.

A spokesperson for Tisdel’s office said the revisions are “part of the legislative process” and that the plan is to introduce the substitute language, shared with CFO Dive by both the spokesperon and Doyle, at the next committee meeting.

Working with the sponsor’s office, Doyle said the revised legislation would keep the state’s existing pathway that requires 150 college credit hours (a baccalaureate degree plus 30 credits or baccalaureate plus a master’s), along with one year of qualified work experience and passage of the CPA exam, while adding a new route to a CPA license which includes a baccalaureate degree plus two years of qualified work experience and passing the exam. A baccalaureate is equivalent to a bachelor’s.

The draft will not include an effective date, but Doyle said the idea is for the bill to be effective when signed into law by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. While Doyle said it’s not a “big deal” if the legislation does not get passed this year, he added that he would prefer to be aligned with other states, noting that there’s great interest in the change.

“I want to get it moving, I don’t want to wait,” Doyle said.

Supporters of alternative pathways hope to ease an accounting talent shortage by removing what they say is a costly barrier that typically equates to a total of five years in college or graduate school.

The global race to secure lithium supply chains is intensifying as battery manufacturers and automakers compete for reliable sources of this critical mineral. At the center of this competition is a critical challenge facing North America: the ""lithium conversion gap."" Lithium Universe's bold move to establish a second refinery in Texas represents a strategic response to this challenge, creating a dual-location processing platform spanning the United States and Canada.

What is the Lithium Conversion Gap and Why Does It Matter?

North America faces a significant disconnect between its battery manufacturing ambitions and its lithium refining capabilities. While billions of dollars are being invested in battery gigafactories across the continent, the region lacks sufficient domestic capacity to convert raw lithium materials into the high-purity compounds these facilities require.

This ""lithium conversion gap"" has created a precarious situation where battery manufacturers must rely heavily on overseas refineries, particularly in Asia. The dependency introduces multiple vulnerabilities:

Supply chain risks: Reliance on long international shipping routes exposes manufacturers to logistical disruptions

Geopolitical concerns: Critical minerals energy security becomes subject to international relations

Economic leakage: Value-added processing occurs offshore rather than creating domestic jobs

Sustainability impacts: Extended transportation increases carbon footprint of battery production

Without addressing this bottleneck, North America's transition to electric vehicles faces significant headwinds, potentially slowing adoption rates and limiting economic benefits. The gap between regional demand and processing capabilities continues to widen as more battery manufacturing capacity comes online.

Industry analysts project North American lithium demand could increase five-fold by 2030, while current domestic refining capacity meets less than 10% of anticipated needs. This disparity has prompted governments to implement policies specifically targeting this vulnerability in the battery supply chain.

Why is Lithium Universe Expanding to Texas?

Lithium Universe's announcement of a second lithium carbonate refinery in Brownsville, Texas represents a strategic expansion of the company's North American footprint. This development complements rather than competes with the company's flagship Bécancour project in Québec.

According to Iggy Tan, Executive Chairman of Lithium Universe Ltd, ""Brownsville represents an extraordinary opportunity to extend our lithium refinery strategy beyond Québec. With the Inflation Reduction Act, Department of Energy programs, and clear national ambitions for critical mineral independence, the timing is ideal to establish a foothold in Texas.""

The dual-location strategy creates a binational processing platform that addresses different regional markets while maximizing policy advantages in both countries:

Strategic Geographic Positioning

Québec facility: Serves as a Trans-Atlantic hub powered by Hydro-Québec's renewable energy, primarily supplying Canadian and European markets

Texas facility: Functions as the U.S. hub, integrated with Gulf Coast logistics and positioned closer to American gigafactories

This geographic diversification offers several compelling advantages:

Risk mitigation: Reduces vulnerability to regional disruptions by operating in two distinct jurisdictions

Market access: Places processing capacity closer to end-users, reducing logistics costs and complexity

Policy optimization: Leverages incentives available in both U.S. and Canadian regulatory environments

Feedstock flexibility: Enables sourcing of raw materials from diverse global suppliers

Customer diversification: Facilitates relationships with battery manufacturers in multiple markets

Importantly, the company emphasizes that Bécancour remains its first priority, with the definitive feasibility study completed and offtake discussions underway. The Texas initiative represents a parallel growth pathway rather than a diversion of focus.

Grijalva, who spent more than 50 years in elected office, including two decades as a congressman from Arizona.

“Anywhere we’d go, we’d go to a restaurant, the people would be standing there, staring.”

She and her sisters became a part of his entourage.

“We were, like, staffing him all the time: ‘Yeah, that guy wants to take a picture’ [or] ‘That lady wants to talk to you,’” she said. And he’d talk. “That’s just the way he was.”

Grijalva says her father modeled how to stay humble in office, a lesson she plans to put into practice once she’s sworn in to represent Arizona’s 7th District. But when that will happen still remains in question.

More than a month after winning a special election to replace her father, Grijalva has not yet been seated, the byproduct of rising Hill tensions amid a partial government shutdown. Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has suggested she will be sworn in only when the government reopens.

Once she joins the 119th Congress, she will be among a growing list of lawmakers who followed their parents to Capitol Hill, bringing the total to at least a dozen. They include Alaska Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski, who was appointed by her father Frank H. Murkowski when he was elected governor. And House Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi, the daughter of powerful Baltimore Democrat Thomas D’Alesandro Jr., who served in the House from 1939 to 1947.

Candidates have congressional connections

Already more than a half-dozen congressional progeny are seeking office in the 2026 midterms, including Stefany Shaheen, daughter of New Hampshire Democrat Sen. Jeanne Shaheen; Jim Kingston, son of former Georgia Republican Rep. Jack Kingston; and Jake Levine, son of former California Democrat Rep. Mel Levine.

Pelosi has declined to confirm that her own daughter, Christine Pelosi, may run to succeed her. Asked whether she has advice for her or for Grijalva, she replied, “Well, my daughter … that isn’t anything that is a reality yet.”

Pelosi added, “In terms of Adelita, the advice I give all women who come here: be yourself, the authentic you, and know your power. ”

Political observers note the clear benefits of being a politician’s child while running for office.

“A huge barrier to entry for a lot of folks is access to certain networks and just simply name recognition,” said Casey Burgat, director of the legislative affairs program at the George Washington University’s Graduate School of Political Management.

At the same time, Burgat says, there’s the risk of being pigeonholed as a copy of your parent or associated with their flaws, pointing to New Jersey Democrat Rep. Rob Menendez, the son of former Sen. Bob Menendez. His father was well connected on Capitol Hill and chaired the Foreign Relations Committee before his political career came to an ignominious end. The senior Menendez was convicted in a sweeping corruption case in 2024 and is currently serving an 11-year prison sentence.

“It’s tough to walk the fine line of ‘I’m going to be as effective as my father proved to be,’ and then all of a sudden you need to distance yourself,” Burgat said.

For congressional progeny, that distance can be political or personal. Grijalva says people have accused her in the past of parroting her father: “My dad always said, ‘You have to be the best prepared. You have to do your homework all the time. You have to know everything that’s going on, because people are going to discount you all the time.’”

Casting their own political identity

Stepping out of a parent’s political shadow can take some time. When Murkowski was first appointed to the Senate, her record closely resembled that of her father – a staunch conservative who almost always voted with Republicans.

More than two decades later, she is known as a political maverick, with a voting record to match. In 2024, she broke with the GOP on more than half of all party-line votes. Once limited to issues like abortion and judicial nominations, Murkowski’s split with Republicans has been felt on a broader range of issues in recent years, including homeland security and foreign policy.

Pelosi, who rose to become the first woman to be elected as speaker, is such a titanic figure in the House that her own father’s congressional tenure is almost a footnote to hers. But she says that growing up it was her brother, Thomas D’Alesandro III, who was the presumed political heir.

“I always was a volunteer in politics later in life, and then one thing led to another, but I never had any ambition to run for office,” she said. “[My brother] was the one that people thought would be in politics. … That was where the expectation was, never with me, and nor was it anything I wanted.”

Her father lived long enough to see her sworn in after winning a 1987 special election to replace Rep. Sala Burton, who died in office.

Levine, speaking from the campaign trail in California, says it took him time to embrace who his father was.

“There was a time in my life when … [I] would shy away from letting people know that my dad had served because I wanted to stand on my own two feet,” he said. “But after a while, I kind of realized that actually this was quite special.”

Levine says his father never pressed him to run for office and was so modest about his own congressional career that it was only recently that he learned of one of his biggest policy accomplishments. The younger Levine, then a White House energy and climate official, had accompanied President Joe Biden on one of his last trips to name Chuckwalla National Monument, near Joshua Tree National Park.

They were talking about the trip when his father casually dropped that he had written legislation that eventually became the 1994 law establishing Joshua Tree as a national park.

“I just felt so proud of that, but also I sort of joke with my dad that he, of course, never shared that with me,” Levine said.

For her part, Grijalva has followed closely in her father’s political footsteps: Both served on the local Tucson school board, and both were elected as Pima County supervisors.

But she admitted that the timeline didn’t always suit the elder Grijalva: “My dad wanted me to run for office when I was 18. I’m like, ‘I’m going to college.’”

Now Grijalva is eager to embrace her father’s legacy and has her eye on his committee assignments: Natural Resources and Education and the Workforce. And she is already talking about making some of his policy proposals her own, including a sweeping bill to classify some environmental regulations as civil rights concerns under the law.

With solar panels on 126 school building rooftops, New York City schools are central to the city and state’s green energy goals and generate the majority of solar energy installed on municipal buildings.

These solar arrays produce nearly 20 megawatts — enough to power about 24,000 city households — and make up roughly 80% of the overall solar power capacity from city buildings. They are also critical to achieving a local mandate of 150 megawatts of solar citywide by 2035.

Experts say school solar projects not only cut energy costs and reduce emissions, but also ease students’ climate anxiety and strengthen community resilience during emergencies. More than half of FEMA’s approximately 67,500 designated shelters nationwide are located in schools, making it more urgent to equip them with solar storage systems that can provide backup power during outages.

Solar has even entered the mayoral race: Zohran Mamdani has highlighted it in his green schools platform, one of the first education policies the mayoral frontrunner put forth.

But solar projects now face uncertainty under the “one big beautiful bill” signed by President Donald Trump in July. Under the law, federal tax credits that have incentivized and funded school solar initiatives are set to expire by the end of 2027, leaving districts scrambling to initiate and complete projects before the phaseout. Tax credits generally pay for 30% of installation costs.

It’s one of several blows to school systems that want to be more green, including cuts to federal grants for electric school buses.

Advocates are urging schools to start new solar projects before the end of this calendar year and finish by June 2026 — a window that would allow them to circumvent many of the new restrictions in the law that, they warn, could make it harder for schools to qualify for credits.

“ What I don’t want to have happen is for schools to unwittingly move forward, be counting on that credit, and then be surprised if one of these new rules trips them up,” said Sara Ross, cofounder of UndauntedK12, a nonprofit that supports K-12 public schools’ transition to clean energy.

New York City schools are pressing ahead on solar work, with an additional 90 solar projects in progress and another 200 schools under review for future installations, officials said.

“New York City Public Schools remains committed to sustainability and climate education for our students,” Education Department spokesperson Jenna Lyle said in a statement.

Department officials did not comment directly on the federal legislation, saying they are “monitoring this situation.”

To pay for the 126 school solar installations, Education Department officials said the city invested $30 million in capital funds and an additional $100 million through long-term power purchase agreements, an arrangement where private developers pay for installation of a solar system and schools agree to pay the developer for the electricity they use, typically over a long period of time.

Schools’ role in transitioning to clean energy

Although they account for just 1% of total carbon emissions in the United States, school buildings produce an estimated range of 41 million to 72 million metric tons of carbon dioxide, according to researchers at Brown University. They also consume a significant amount of energy.

In 2019, New York’s roughly 1,400 school facilities accounted for more than a third of all energy consumption across city-owned buildings.

The city’s Education Department already spends about $275 million per year on energy, a figure experts say is likely to grow as utility costs rise and aging school facilities face mounting stress from extreme weather tied to climate change.

But schools’ size — they make up 36% of all city-owned square footage — also make them ideal stewards of clean energy.

“Schools have a lot of land, they have a lot of assets,” said Ross. “When sunlight is hitting those every day, why wouldn’t we be harvesting that sunlight to reduce our costs?”

New York schools installed their first rooftop solar arrays nearly 20 years ago, Education Department officials said. But the program’s expansion didn’t gain momentum until 2021, with installations ramping up in the last five years.

The city is currently developing solar and battery storage systems at five schools in partnership with several city agencies. Among them are P.S. 48 and M.S. 424 in the Bronx, both of which double as emergency shelters.

Education department officials said they could not provide an estimate of how much money completed projects have saved to date, but added that in the long term, the city will have saved more than it has spent on solar installation. Ross said those savings can help schools afford other needs.

“ School budgets are tight, and fundamentally, solar is the cheapest energy around, so when schools install solar, they can reduce their operating costs,” Ross said. “That frees up more dollars to go back into their core mission — whether that’s improving other parts of their facility, having more dollars for student programming, and increasing teacher salaries.”

Karin Goldmark, founder of GreenLink Education, an organization that helps schools take climate action, noted that rising temperatures will contribute to higher energy costs.

“It’s worth it to do solar, particularly if you have 1,400 buildings and you’re paying energy bills for all of them,” she said.

Goldmark said that in the summer, when school buildings sit largely empty, they can sell excess solar power back to utilities, thereby providing clean energy that offsets the need for gas-fired plants.

“That’s an important contribution to the energy transition the country needs to make, and it generates revenue for schools in the process,” she said.

Funding school solar projects

Installing solar panels can deliver major long-term savings, but the upfront costs are steep and often out of reach for school districts, especially those that want to install large-scale solar projects like in New York City.

The Inflation Reduction Act, signed under former President Joe Biden, changed that by opening up clean energy tax credits to schools in 2022. Although schools are tax-exempt and cannot claim credits directly, an “elective pay” provision allowed them to convert those credits into cash reimbursements. That effectively created new funding for solar and other clean energy projects — with virtually no cap, Ross said.

“We have spent the last three years shouting this from every rooftop, going to conferences of superintendents and business officers and school board members and facilities leaders and really spreading the word about this massive opportunity to have the federal government defray the cost of these very energy and cost-efficient machines,” she said.

Now, UndauntedK12 and other clean energy advocates are working to educate schools on how to make the most of the tax credits before they disappear.

In addition to the narrow timeline for initiating and completing school solar projects, a process experts note can take years, “the one big beautiful bill” imposes a new set of restrictions schools must follow in order to qualify for tax credits.

One requirement, for example, mandates that a share of solar panels be sourced and assembled domestically.

Solar developer Jared Lang said that the rule is driving up costs, since domestic solar developers have long relied on imported materials after Chinese manufacturers flooded the American market years ago.

“All the new tax credit requirements forcing us to use domestically assembled panels are basically costing us about 50% more,” said Lang, who also owns Housing Sustainability Advisors, which supports affordable housing owners in moving to solar.

“It’s really going to affect how much solar we can build,” Lang said.

Ross said that while the expiration of tax credits will make the transition to solar more challenging, schools funded projects before the Inflation Reduction Act created new clean energy incentives.

She pointed to power purchase agreements as a longstanding, affordable method for schools to launch solar projects.

“There’s a path forward, even for districts that don’t have money,” Ross said.",https://www.chalkbeat.org/resizer/v2/NBPKFOUG2FFXBGIECUJPTFYKCQ.jpg?smart=true&auth=dd1774698d8a6a0e6ec13cd7206d0cbaa7fe8d22260cd43f34942c88088c272f&width=1200&height=630,N,,2025-10-14 17:05:10.687914

Cancellation of Government Subsidies

The market for electric vehicles in the United States has come under pressure after the US government under President Donald Trump allowed federal tax credits for EVs worth 7,500 US dollars to expire. ""Given the recent policy changes by the US government, including the cancellation of certain tax benefits for the purchase of electric vehicles and the relaxation of emissions regulations, we expect a decline in the acceptance of electric vehicles,"" GM stated in the announcement.

Following the cancellation of government subsidies, GM will realign its electric vehicle strategy. GM has invested billions of US dollars in the electric car market. According to US news channel CNBC the company planned to invest up to 30 billion US dollars in electric vehicles by this year, including dozens of new models and battery production capacities. This is now being put to the test. The re-evaluation of its EV capacities and production sites is still ongoing, the automaker stated. This suggests, according to CNBC, that further costs could be announced in future quarters.

Ford with Billion-Dollar Write-off in 2024

GM's write-offs for electric vehicles come a little more than a year after competitor Ford shelved its plans for a three-row electric SUV and also wrote off a billion-dollar amount. Ford wrote off 400 million US dollars on product-specific assets and materials directly and additionally calculated further write-offs and costs of up to 1.5 billion US dollars in the following quarters.

General Motors, which offers the most EV models in the USA, has recently achieved significant growth in EV sales, but last year the EV market in the USA already grew slower than the non-electric market. This trend is likely to intensify after Trump's policy shift. In the short term, industry observers expect a sharp decline in electric car sales before a recovery eventually occurs.

With your partnership, it can continue to deliver cleaner energy, healthier air and stronger communities for the next 15 years — and beyond.","Fifteen years ago, MCE (known then as Marin County Energy) was little more than an idea.

A group of community leaders and advocates believed that residents deserved cleaner choices and a stronger voice in where their electricity came from. At the time, fossil fuels dominated California’s energy supply, and the only option for customers was the Pacific Gas and Electric Co.’s 13% renewable mix. Many said a small local public agency couldn’t possibly compete with the utilities, let alone lead a clean energy movement.

Fast forward to 2025, and the results speak for themselves. As a member of its Board of Directors close to 12 years, I’ve seen it firsthand. MCE — California’s first Community Choice Aggregation program — now serves nearly 600,000 customer accounts and 1.8 million residents and businesses across 38 communities in Contra Costa, Marin, Napa and Solano counties. What started as a choice for a few thousand customers has grown into a model that has inspired 25 community-choice programs across the state, collectively serving one-third of Californians.

Since launching in 2010, MCE has surpassed California’s clean electricity targets years ahead of schedule. Today, all MCE service options are 100% fossil-free and our flagship Deep Green program provides customers with 100% renewable energy to serve their needs each year. My town of Fairfax has the highest percentage of Deep Green signups among MCE members, with 13.2%.

The results have been tangible: Together, we’ve eliminated over 500,000 metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions — the equivalent of removing more than 116,000 cars from the road. Cleaner energy means cleaner air, healthier communities, vibrant local economies and meaningful progress in tackling climate change.

Even during turbulent times for California’s energy market, MCE has kept rates stable and competitive. Through sound financial management, it has earned A-range investment-grade credit ratings from Fitch Ratings and S&P Global. Those ratings, along with innovative financing tools like green bonds and prepay transactions, have saved customers millions of dollars while ensuring it can invest in the resources of tomorrow.

Since 2010, customers have saved over $70 million compared to PG&E. At the same time, MCE has built a healthy reserve fund, maintaining over 200 days of cash on hand. This figure is on par with utility industry best practices and is a significant driver of MCE’s investment-grade credit rating, which in turn allows it to negotiate more favorable renewable power contracts while maintaining stable rates.

What makes MCE different is that it is a not-for-profit public agency. Priorities are set by a board of local elected officials, not shareholders. That means when it succeeds, our communities succeed. Over the past 15 years, MCE has reinvested more than $400 million locally — funding renewable energy projects, providing bill relief for income-qualified customers, offering EV rebates and supporting workforce training that helps residents access well-paying clean energy jobs.

From solar arrays on former brownfields to battery storage at food banks and shelters, MCE projects deliver more than electrons — they deliver equity, resilience and opportunity. More than 7,000 green jobs in California have been supported through MCE’s work, and programs like its NextGen Trades Academy are helping underserved youth gain hands-on training in electrification and energy efficiency careers.

MCE has also made it easier for families and small businesses to participate in the clean energy economy. In 2025 alone, nearly 1,000 MCE customers received EV rebates at the point of sale, with over half used for pre-owned vehicles — proving that clean transportation can be affordable and accessible.

The years haven’t always been easy. There were skeptics in the early years, and today it still faces challenges, from rising energy costs to climate impacts. But through it all, MCE has shown that when communities come together, it can take on big challenges and deliver real results.

As MCE celebrates 15 years of service, I am deeply grateful to the customers, workers and community partners who have made this possible. Together, MCE has built more than an electricity provider. It has built a model for how local communities can lead California’s transition to clean energy while keeping costs competitive and reinvesting in the places we call home.

The story of MCE is still being written. With your partnership, it can continue to deliver cleaner energy, healthier air and stronger communities for the next 15 years — and beyond.

In a data centre boom in Mexico's Querétaro state, big tech companies are given leeway to bypass environmental requirements.

Querétaro state lets data centres skip environmental impact reports

Data centres also exempt from CO2 tax

Experts warn of effects on drought-stricken state

QUERÉTARO, Mexico - A data centre boom is gathering momentum in central Mexico, where the local government of Querétaro has made it easier for foreign big tech companies to bypass environmental reporting requirements and taxes, an investigation by Context has found.

A dozen data centres operate in the semi-desert state of Querétaro, with most of the massive warehouse-like structures built in the past three years.

Data centres can house thousands of servers used by big tech companies like Microsoft, Google and Amazon for their storage services and the massive amount of data used in generative artificial intelligence tools such as Copilot and Gemini.

Most data centres in Querétaro, owned by companies such as U.S.-based Aligned Data Centers and Equinix, operate in industrial parks, locations that exempt them from providing environmental impact reports.

As such, Querétaro residents say when a data centre arrives, they are not informed about the potential effects on the water-stressed environment.

""This opacity prevents us, as citizens, from the possibility of having evidence of this industry's specific impact,"" said Paola Ricaurte, a professor at the Tecnológico de Monterrey University.

Communities are responding by demanding greater regulation and transparency about the water and energy that data centres consume.

Data centres use a lot of energy to run their servers and a large amount of water to cool them. In 2023, for example, all of Google's data centres consumed 6.1 billion gallons of water, according to the company.

""Without concrete evidence, we cannot defend our rights to health and information or have transparency on the decisions the government takes to benefit the industry,"" said Ricaurte, who is researching data centres' environmental footprint in Querétaro.

Marco Del Prete, Secretary of Sustainable Development, said data centres are not classified as an industry but as a service provider, which is why they are exempt from providing environmental impact reports.

""The data centre is a service company that doesn't process supplies or generate direct emissions. It doesn't need to obtain an environmental impact report,"" said Del Prete in an interview with Context.

A 2022 document issued by the Ministry of Sustainable Development showed that a data centre operated by Microsoft in Querétaro did not need an environmental impact report as its ""activities are not considered fixed sources of emissions.""

""There is obligation""

Lawyer Lorenia Trueba, a member of Voceras de la Madre Tierra, a local environmental group, said all data centres should issue environmental impact reports due to their high water and energy use.

""The state's environmental code mentions that any activity which can cause environmental impact - when there is any risk or possibility of an impact - there is an obligation to issue an environmental impact report,"" Trueba told Context.

Trueba also said Querétaro is bound by Supreme Court decisions and international treaties such as the Escazú Agreement, which establish communities' right to access environmental information.

""They can't say that the technology used in data centres doesn't have an environmental impact,"" Trueba said.

""Where is all the information that should be put on the table so that people, academics, scientists, authorities and companies can sit down and discuss it?""

No local or federal law in Mexico regulates the environmental requirements for data centres.

Gov. Mauricio Kuri is leading the drive to attract big tech to Querétaro, which already has drawn $12 billion of investment for new data centres from Microsoft, Google and Amazon.

President Claudia Sheinbaum announced in September that U.S. tech firm CloudHQ will invest $4.8 billion in a project to build six AI data centres in Querétaro.

Globally, data centre construction is being promoted from Santiago, Chile and Zeewolde in the Netherlands to Ekurhuleni in South Africa, where governments are offering financial incentives, according to the UK-based consultancy Computer Says Maybe.

In the United States and Brazil, local and federal agencies are cutting regulation, speeding up permitting processes and making land available for planned data centres.

Water shortages

AI is poised to increase the amount of water that data centres use, as its power-intensive processors have greater cooling requirements than do conventional servers.

Querétaro has been struggling with water shortages and strict rationing after four years in which at least one of its municipalities has been under drought conditions, according to a federal monitor.

In the past year, residents living near data centres told Context their taps run dry and they suffer frequent power cuts.

Without environmental disclosures by data centres, experts said it is impossible to determine how much water they are using or where precisely they are getting it.

""We're in a sea of uncertainty... there's no data on data centres,"" said Teresa García Gasca, former dean at the Autonomous University of Querétaro.

""A lack of transparency is always very serious and creates mistrust,"" she said.

Data centres built outside the confines of industrial parks, meanwhile, do provide information on their impact.

Ricaurte said some companies should not be allowed to bypass environmental requirements and override citizen concerns.

""We as citizens have the right to know exactly how they are operating and what's the possible impact they may have on health, on the environment, on the land,"" she said.

Tax exemption

Mexico is also making itself attractive to tech companies by exempting them from certain gas emission taxes.

Since 2021, Querétaro has levied a tax on companies as direct and indirect sources of carbon dioxide, methane and other gases in a bid to reduce greenhouse gases emissions.

But data centre companies are exempt because they are not considered fixed sources of direct emissions, according to Del Prete.

""The emissions that a data centre generates are indirect emissions that don't come directly from the operations of the data centre,"" he said.

Critics say the tax exemption for data centres also puts local communities at a disadvantage.

John McCarrick, the company’s new head of Global Energy Policy, was a senior energy policy advisor in the first Trump administration’s Bureau of Energy Resources in the Department of State while under former Secretaries of State Rex Tillerson and Mike Pompeo.
Look, here’s one bottom line: if we actually had to build enormous networks of AI data centers, the obvious, cheap, and clean way to do it would be with lots of solar energy.
This study empirically legitimizes doubts about the commitment of the industry to transition to low-carbon energy production.
In some cases, members now sell more electric than gas equipment, though across the industry gas is still the leader, Cunningham says.","Caveat—this post was written entirely with my own intelligence, so who knows. Maybe it’s wrong.

But the despairing question I get asked most often is: “What’s the use? However much clean energy we produce, AI data centers will simply soak it all up.” It’s too early in the course of this technology to know anything for sure, but there are a few important answers to that.

.

The first comes from Amory Lovins, the long-time energy guru who wrote a paper some months ago pointing out that energy demand from AI was highly speculative, an idea he based on… history.

“In 1999, the US coal industry claimed that information technology would need half the nation’s electricity by 2020, so a strong economy required far more coal-fired power stations. Such claims were spectacularly wrong but widely believed, even by top officials. Hundreds of unneeded power plants were built, hurting investors. Despite that costly lesson, similar dynamics are now unfolding again.”

As Debra Kahn pointed out in Politico a few weeks ago,

So far, data centers have only increased total U.S. power demand by a tiny amount (they make up roughly 4.4 percent of electricity use, which rose 2 percent overall last year).

And it’s possible that even if AI expands as its proponents expect, it will grow steadily more efficient, meaning it would need much less energy than predicted. Lovins again:

For example, NVIDIA’s head of data center product marketing said in September 2024 that in the past decade, “we’ve seen the efficiency of doing inferences in certain language models has increased effectively by 100,000 times. Do we expect that to continue? I think so: There’s lots of room for optimization.” Another NVIDIA comment reckons to have made AI inference (across more models) 45,000× more efficient since 2016, and expects orders-ofmagnitude further gains. Indeed, in 2020, NVIDIA’s Ampere chips needed 150 joules of energy per inference; in 2022, their Hopper successors needed just 15; and in 2024, their Blackwell successors needed 24 but also quintupled performance, thus using 31× less energy than Ampere per unit of performance. (Such comparisons depend on complex and wideranging assumptions, creating big discrepancies, so another expert interprets the data as up to 25× less energy and 30× better performance, multiplying to 750×.)

But that doesn’t mean that the AI industry, and its utility and government partners, won’t try to build ever more generating capacity to supply whatever power needs they project may be coming. In some places they already are: Internet Alley in Virginia has more than 150 large centers, using a quarter of its power. This is becoming an intense political issue in the Old Dominion State. As Dave Weigel reported yesterday, the issue has begun to roil Virginia politics—the GOP candidate for governor sticks with her predecessor, Glenn Youngkin, in somehow blaming solar energy for rising electricity prices (“the sun goes down”), while the Democratic nominee, Abigail Spanberger, is trying to figure out a response

Neither nominee has gone as far in curbing growth as many suburban DC legislators and activists want. They see some of the world’s wealthiest companies getting plugged into the grid without locals reaping the benefits. Some Virginia elections have turned into battles over which candidate will be toughest on data centers; others elections have already been lost over them.

“My advice to Abigail has been: Look at where the citizens of Virginia are on the data centers,” said state Sen. Danica Roem, a Democrat who represents part of Prince William County in DC’s growing suburbs. “There are a lot of people willing to be single-issue, split-ticket voters based on this.”

Indeed, it’s shaping up to be the mother of all political issues as the midterms loom—pretty much everyone pays electric rates, and under Trump they’re starting to skyrocket. The reason isn’t hard to figure out: he’s simultaneously accelerating demand with his support for data center buildout, and constricting supply by shutting down cheap solar and wind. In fact, one way of looking at AI is that it’s main use is as a vehicle to give the fossil fuel industry one last reason to expand.

If this sounds conspiratorial, consider this story from yesterday: John McCarrick, newly hired by industry colossus OpenAI to find energy sources for ChatGPT is

an official from the first Trump administration who is a dedicated champion of natural gas.

John McCarrick, the company’s new head of Global Energy Policy, was a senior energy policy advisor in the first Trump administration’s Bureau of Energy Resources in the Department of State while under former Secretaries of State Rex Tillerson and Mike Pompeo.

As deputy assistant secretary for Energy Transformation and the special envoy for International Energy Affairs, McCarrick promoted exports of American liquefied natural gas to Europe in the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and advocated for Asian countries to invest in natural gas.

The choice to hire McCarrick matches the intentions of OpenAI’s Trump-dominating CEO Sam Altman, who said in a U.S. Senate hearing in May that “in the short term, I think [the future of powering AI] probably looks like more natural gas.”

Sam Altman himself is an acolyte of Peter Thiel, famous climate-denier who recently suggested Greta Thunberg might be the anti-Christ. But it’s all of them. In the rush to keep their valuations high, the big AI players are increasingly relying not just on fracked gas but on the very worst version of it. As Bloomberg reported early in the summer

The trend has sparked an unlikely comeback for a type of gas turbine that long ago fell out of favor for being inefficient and polluting…a technology that’s largely been relegated to the sidelines of power production: small, single cycle natural gas turbines.

In fact, big suppliers are now companies like Caterpillar, not known for cutting edge turbine technology; these are small and comparatively dirty units.

(The ultimate example of this is Elon Musk’s Colossus supercomputer in Memphis, a superpolluter, which I wrote about for the New Yorker.) Oh, and it’s not just air pollution. A new threat emerged in the last few weeks, according to Tom Perkins in the Guardian

Advocates are particularly concerned over the facilities’ use of Pfas gas, or f-gas, which can be potent greenhouse gases, and may mean datacenters’ climate impact is worse than previously thought. Other f-gases turn into a type of dangerous compound that is rapidly accumulating across the globe.

No testing for Pfas air or water pollution has yet been done, and companies are not required to report the volume of chemicals they use or discharge. But some environmental groups are starting to push for state legislation that would require more reporting.

Look, here’s one bottom line: if we actually had to build enormous networks of AI data centers, the obvious, cheap, and clean way to do it would be with lots of solar energy. It goes up fast. As an industry study found as long ago as December of 2024 (an eon in AI time),

Off-grid solar microgrids offer a fast path to power AI datacenters at enormous scale. The tech is mature, the suitable parcels of land in the US Southwest are known, and this solution is likely faster than most, if not all, alternatives.

As one of the country’s leading energy executives said in April,

“Renewables and battery storage are the lowest-cost form of power generation and capacity,” according to Next Era chief executive John Ketchum l. “We can build these projects and get new electrons on the grid in 12 to 18 months.”

But we can’t do that because the Trump administration has a corrupt ideological bias against clean energy, the latest example of which came last week when a giant Nevada solar project was cancelled. As Jael Holzman was the first to report

Esmeralda 7 was supposed to produce a gargantuan 6.2 gigawatts of power – equal to nearly all the power supplied to southern Nevada by the state’s primary public utility. It would do so with a sprawling web of solar panels and batteries across the western Nevada desert. Backed by NextEra Energy, Invenergy, ConnectGen and other renewables developers, the project was moving forward at a relatively smooth pace under the Biden administration.

But now it’s dead. One result will be higher prices for consumers. Despite everything the administration does, renewables are so cheap and easy that markets just keep choosing them. To beat that means policy as perverse as what we’re seeing—jury-rigging tired gas turbines and refitting ancient coal plants. All to power a technology that…seems increasingly like a bubble?

Here we need to get away from energy implications a bit, and just think about the underlying case for AI, and specifically the large language models that are the thing we’re spending so much money and power on. The AI industry is, increasingly, the American economy—it accounts for almost half of U.S. economic growth this year, and an incredible eighty percent of the expansion of the stock market. As Ruchir Shirma wrote in the FT last week, the U.S. economy is “one big bet” on AI.

The main reason AI is regarded as a magic fix for so many different threats is that it is expected to deliver a significant boost to productivity growth, especially in the US. Higher output per worker would lower the burden of debt by boosting GDP. It would reduce demand for labour, immigrant or domestic. And it would ease inflation risks, including the threat from tariffs, by enabling companies to raise wages without raising prices.

But for this happy picture to come to pass, AI has to actually work, which is to say do more than help kids cheat on their homework. And there’s been a growing sense in recent months that all is not right on that front. I’ve been following two AI skeptics for a year or so, both on Substack (where increasingly, in-depth and non-orthodox reporting go to thrive).

The first is Gary Marcus, an AI researcher who has concluded that the large language models like Chat GPT are going down a blind alley. If you like to watch video, here is an encapsulation of his main points, published over the weekend. If you prefer that old-fashioned technology of reading (call me a Luddite, but it seems faster and more efficient, and much easier to excerpt), here’s his recent account from the Times explaining why businesses are having trouble finding reasons to pay money for this technology.

Large language models have had their uses, especially for coding, writing and brainstorming, in which humans are still directly involved. But no matter how large we have made them, they have never been worthy of our trust.

Indeed, an MIT study this year found that 95% of businesses reported no measurable increase in productivity from using AI; the Harvard Business Review, a couple of weeks ago, said AI “workslop” was cratering productivity.”

And what that means, in turn, is that there’s no real way to imagine recovering the hundreds of billions/trillions that are currently being invested in the technology. The keeper of the spreadsheets is the other Substacker, Ed Zitron, who writes extremely long and increasingly exasperated essays looking at the financial lunacy of these “investments” which, remember, underpin the stock market at the moment. Here’s last week’s:

In fact, let me put it a little simpler: all of those data center deals you’ve seen announced are basically bullshit. Even if they get the permits and the money, there are massive physical challenges that cannot be resolved by simply throwing money at them.

Today I’m going to tell you a story of chaos, hubris and fantastical thinking. I want you to come away from this with a full picture of how ridiculous the promises are, and that’s before you get to the cold hard reality that AI fucking sucks.

I’m not pretending this is the final word on this subject. No one knows how it’s all going to work out, but my guess is: badly. Already it’s sending electricity prices soaring and increasing fossil fuel emissions.

But maybe it’s also running other kinds of walls that will eventually reduce demand. Maybe human beings will decide to be… human. The new Sora “service” launched by OpenAI that allows your AI to generate fake videos, for instance, threatens to undermine the entire business of looking at videos because…what’s the point? If you can’t tell if the guy eating a ridiculously hot chili pepper is real or not, why would you watch? In a broader sense, as John Burns-Murdoch wrote in the FT (and again how lucky Europe is to have a reputable business newspaper), we may be reaching “peak social media.”

It has gone largely unnoticed that time spent on social media peaked in 2022 and has since gone into steady decline, according to an analysis of the online habits of 250,000 adults in more than 50 countries carried out for the FT by the digital audience insights company GWI.

And this is not just the unwinding of a bump in screen time during pandemic lockdowns — usage has traced a smooth curve up and down over the past decade-plus. Across the developed world, adults aged 16 and older spent an average of two hours and 20 minutes per day on social platforms at the end of 2024, down by almost 10 per cent since 2022. Notably, the decline is most pronounced among the erstwhile heaviest users — teens and 20-somethings.

Which is to say: perhaps at some point we’ll begin to come to our senses and start using our brains and bodies for the things they were built for: contact with each other, and with the world around us. That’s a lot to ask, but the world can turn in good directions as well as bad. As a final word, there’s this last week from Pope Leo, speaking to a bunch of news executives around the world, and imploring them to cool it with the junk they’re putting out.

“Communication must be freed from the misguided thinking that corrupts it, from unfair competition, and the degrading practice of so-called clickbait.”

Stay tuned. This story will have a lot to do with how the world turns out.

Politico wrote of the race: “Republicans are hoping to use the election as a way to tamp down any Democratic optimism ahead of 2026.” As a state GOP strategist told the outlet: “For Republican voters, it is important to turn out because a win by Democrats will tell Democrats nationally that there’s blood in the water.”

Bigger German news comes via the indefatigable climate organizer Luisa Neubauer in her hometown of Hamburg, which just voted in a powerful new climate mandate. Here’s a link to the story in the German papers, and here’s Luisa’s report:

The law introduces a new net zero target (2040 instead of 2045), binding emissions budgets for the city (to be reviewed each year) and a paragraph that says all climate policies have to be socially just. As far as we know a climate law like this is incredibly rare.

We fought for two years to make it happen, to win a public referendum is super rare and happens only once in ten years. As the German government is effectively boycotting climate action, this is an incredible sign coming from the citizens of Hamburg.

+Despite the Trump regime’s attempt to “revitalize” the coal industry, a big new leasing sale in Montana and Wyoming this week flopped

Federal officials indefinitely postponed a Wyoming coal lease sale scheduled for Wednesday, apparently in response to what many observers consider a lowball bid on another federal coal lease on Monday in Montana.

Navajo Transitional Energy Company, the only bidder, stunned coal market watchers with an offer of $186,000 for 167 million tons of federal coal associated with its Spring Creek mine in southeast Montana — a fraction of a penny per ton and woefully low compared to past federal coal lease sales in the region. The last such major sale in the region, in 2012, netted $793 million for 721 million tons, or about $1.10 per ton, according to federal data.

+If anyone ever tries to tell you that Big Oil is helping with the energy transition, hand them this new study that shows

An analysis of the energy assets of 250 of the largest oil and gas companies finds a marginal contribution to global renewable energy deployment and that renewable generation represents a tiny proportion of the total energy production of these companies. This study empirically legitimizes doubts about the commitment of the industry to transition to low-carbon energy production.

+The world’s top chefs are starting to convert en masse to induction cooktops—less for climate reasons than because they offer such fine-grained control.

In some cases, members now sell more electric than gas equipment, though across the industry gas is still the leader, Cunningham says.

The precise settings on the induction stove mean Chan’s recipes can be carried out to exact specifications by his staff, with no room for interpretation as there would be with instructions like “a low flame.” “There’s less human error,” he says. “You can be more precise in a more foolproof way. You can just say set it to, say, 3.5 — there’s nothing to interpret there.”

+New report today from the folks at Reclaim Finance on why “coal transition offsets” are unlikely to work

The carbon offset industry has struggled with credibility issues since its inception. CTOs will face the same conceptual and methodological flaws as other offset categories, with their issuance managed by the same players that run the existing offsets market, and following the same processes. The core of the issue is the industry’s chronic inability to answer two basic questions: 1. Would the project have happened without offsets (is it “additional”)? 2. How many offsets should the project be allowed to produce? Analyses of both regulated programs and the voluntary offsets market show that, time and again, market players have answered these questions in a way which favors offset quantity over quality.

According to a comprehensive peer-reviewed study, less than 16% of all offsets issued up to 2024 are likely to represent real emissions reductions — suggesting that bogus offsets representing 4.4 billion tonnes of CO2 have been generated, an amount just under that of US fossil fuel CO2 emissions in 2023. A European Commission study of the Kyoto Protocol’s Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), the single largest source of offsets, found that only 2% of its projects had a high likelihood of being additional, while 85% had a low likelihood of representing real emissions reductions. Meanwhile, financial data company MSCI judges that three-quarters of voluntary market projects carry significant risks of failing to deliver claimed benefits.

+We seem to have passed a major global tipping point, raising temperatures past the point where significant numbers of warm-water coral reefs can be expected to survive, a new study has found

It estimates that coral reefs hit a tipping point when global temperatures reach between 1C and 1.5C above where they were in the latter half of the 19th century, with a central estimate of 1.2C. Global heating is now at about 1.4C.

Without rapid and unlikely cuts to greenhouse gases, the upper threshold of 1.5C would be hit in the next 10 years, the report says.

“We can no longer talk about tipping points as a future risk,” said Prof Tim Lenton at the University of Exeter’s Global Systems Institute. “The first tipping of widespread dieback of warm water coral reefs is already under way.” He said this was already impacting hundreds of millions of people who depend on reefs. The report points to reefs in the Caribbean, where marine heatwaves, low diversity and disease outbreaks have pushed reefs “towards collapse”.

+Another big new study shows that biofuels are indeed the disaster we’ve all long insisted. They not only don’t make things better than fossil fuels, they actually manage to produce more in the way of co2.

Global biofuels production emits 16% more CO2 than the fossil fuels it replaces, a new Cerulogy report on behalf of T&E shows. The same land could feed 1.3 billion people, while using just 3% of that land for solar panels would produce the same amount of energy. With demand set to rise by at least 40% by 2030, T&E calls for global leaders meeting in Brazil for COP30 to agree to limit the expansion of a climate solution that is doing more harm than good.

Today, growing crops to be burned as fuel uses up 32 million hectares of land - roughly the size of Italy - to meet just 4% of global transport energy demand. By 2030 this is set to grow by 60% to 52 million hectares - the size of France.

In DC, a new electric hydrofoil is cutting commuting times in half—because once it gets up on a plane it creates no wake, meaning it can speed through zones where it would otherwise have to slow down. It uses 80 percent less energy than the boats it replaces

Shares fell less than 2% before the opening bell Tuesday.

The EV tax credit ended last month. The clean vehicle tax credit was worth $7,500 for new EVs and up to $4,000 for used ones.

Meanwhile, the Environmental Protection Agency has been working on easing rules aimed at cleaning up auto tailpipe emissions as the Trump administration move to undo incentives for automakers to go electric. President Donald Trump has also challenged federal EV charging infrastructure money and blocked California’s ban of new gas-powered vehicle sales. It adds up to less pressure on automakers to continue evolving their production away from gas-burning vehicles.

General Motors, which had led the way among U.S. automakers with plans to convert production to an electric fleet of vehicles, said in a regulatory filing on Tuesday that it will have to book charges that include non-cash impairment and other charges of $1.2 billion due to EV capacity adjustments. There’s also $400 million in charges mostly related to contract cancellation fees and commercial settlements associated with EV-related investments.

GM warned that it may take additional hits as it adjusts production, with non-cash charges potentially impacting operations and cash flow in the future.

The company said that its EV capacity realignment doesn’t impact its retail portfolio of Chevrolet, GMC and Cadillac EVs currently in production, and that it expects those models to remain available to consumers.

WATCH: Why the red state of Utah is going green and embracing electric vehicles

EVs were considered to be the future of the US automotive industry. GM had announced in 2020 that it was going to invest $27 billion in electric and autonomous vehicles in the next five years, a 35% increase over plans made before the pandemic.

In 2021 GM said that it planned to have more than half of its North American and China factories be capable of making electric vehicles by 2030. It also pledged at the time to increase its investment in EV charging networks by nearly $750 million through 2025.

A year later, GM CEO Mary Barra said that the automaker would sell more electric vehicles in the U.S. than Tesla by the middle of the decade. GM also had a goal of making the vast majority of the vehicles it produces electric by 2035, and the entire company carbon neutral, including operations, five years after that.

Yet U.S. automakers are being hampered in some of their long-term planning, with drastic changes in economic and environmental policy from one administration to the next. The automakers are also facing increased competition from automakers such as China’s BYD, which announced in July that its sales grew 31% in the first six months of the year to 2.1 million cars.

BYD’s sales have skyrocketed on the back of a government-driven EV boom in China. The rise of BYD and other Chinese electric vehicle makers is a challenge for Tesla and the world’s other major automakers as Chinese competitors push into Europe, Southeast Asia and other overseas markets with a relatively affordable option for drivers who want to go green.",https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2025/10/2022-11-18T012108Z_988822127_RC2ZNX975E0F_RTRMADP_3_AUTOSHOW-LA-1024x691.jpg,N,,2025-10-14 17:06:27.280793

(As published in POWER magazine on Oct. 7, 2025)

Here’s a fundamental truth: there is no AI without energy. And as the technology grows, its demand for energy, and carbon footprint, may never again be as small as it is today.

Against this backdrop, debates over which energy source should power AI miss the point. AI’s appetite for energy—relative to what the grid has available today—will demand every tool available. Even if AI growth projections overshoot, energy demand will increase at a scale the power sector hasn’t seen in a generation. The real test is whether society can scale fast enough while ensuring energy remains reliable and affordable for ratepayers—and, at the same time, continuing to improve emissions intensity throughout the energy system.

Market participants are focused on how best to balance these considerations, and at a pace that will support America’s competitive advantages. Governments are also engaging.

The U.S. will need new chip factories, new data centers and, most critically, vast new sources of energy, along with the infrastructure to deliver where it’s needed. Recent reforms outlined in Winning the Race: America’s AI Action Plan aim to accelerate permitting and expedite infrastructure deployment, with the recognition that tomorrow’s energy system will look very different from the one we have today.

Bridging policy ambition with practical delivery requires companies capable of moving energy at scale, making infrastructure essential to the task. Enbridge sits at the center of North America’s energy system, with a proven record of delivering energy where it matters most. Our assets are strategically linked to major population hubs and positioned near the fast-growing data center clusters that will anchor the digital economy.

Being able to move the energy is only one part of the need. A diverse portfolio of energy businesses and capabilities—from natural gas transmission and storage, to gas utilities and renewable power operations—is crucial if we want to deliver a mix of energy sources that support clean energy ambitions while also ensuring continuous baseload power.

Here’s what that looks like in action: Earlier this year, Enbridge announced that it is developing and will be operating the 600-megawatt Clear Fork Solar project near San Antonio, providing clean and renewable energy for a customer.

On the Gulf Coast, advanced optimization projects, including a $50-million expansion of the Southeast Supply Header pipeline across Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama are meeting the growing power needs of a major electric utility serving data centers.

There’s also the expansion of the Texas Eastern Transmission system to support the Homer City Redevelopment generating facility in Pennsylvania, which, when fully operational, will be the largest natural gas-fired power plant in the U.S. dedicated entirely to data centers and AI.

This mix of energy sources and innovation will help to match immediate energy needs with long-term growth projections.

Enbridge’s approach to the energy evolution must include:

lowering the emissions intensity of our operations;

helping customers transition from higher-emitting fuels to lower-carbon options; and

building more efficient and lower carbon infrastructure.

Since 2020, Enbridge has reduced GHG emissions intensity from our operations by 40%.

Yet even with a diverse mix of energy sources—and robust domestic energy supply—planning for AI’s resource use remains challenging. Google recently offered data that punctuates this point: a median prompt to its Gemini model consumes 0.24 watt-hours—about the same as running a laptop for 17 seconds or a microwave for one second.

In June, Sam Altman noted in a blog on AI’s growth that the average ChatGPT query consumes about 0.34 watt-hours of electricity, roughly what a high-efficiency light bulb uses in a couple of minutes.

Numbers like these sharpen public understanding of AI’s energy appetite, but they also expose Jevons paradox—the dynamic where gains in efficiency lower costs, only to spark even greater demand.

For energy providers, that means data-driven planning and experience will be essential. Data centers will need partners that can deliver capacity, reliability and sustainability alike—baseload natural gas, renewables, storage and infrastructure built to meet real demand and support round-the-clock operations.

The paradox also makes clear what’s at stake: as AI expands, innovation will rise or fall on the availability and deliverability of dependable and flexible energy systems.

Meeting this moment will require unprecedented coordination between policymakers, hyperscalers and energy providers.",https://www.enbridge.com/~/media/Enb/Images/Stories/2025/October/Banner_ST_10_14_2025_AI_energy_hunger_1400x600.png?rev=e753ddc735324e5bb11574cea10cf7b4&hash=878B2DF47E95EF96CB07C1BA935C9984,N,,2025-10-14 17:05:54.977352

How this could affect Valley districts,"Mark Brodie, www.kjzz.org, mark-brodie",,,,,https://www.kjzz.org/the-show/2025-10-14/trump-ended-federal-grants-for-electric-school-buses-how-this-could-affect-valley-districts,"With the start of the new federal fiscal year on Oct. 1 came the end of a tax credit school districts had been using to electrify their fleets of buses.
The Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act allocated money for clean energy vehicles, including electric school buses.
According to the Electric School Bus Initiative, Arizona districts had nearly 230 electric school buses committed, but only 49 that either have been delivered or are operating.
MARK BRODIE: So does that mean that there are likely going to be fewer electric school buses on the roads around the country than districts maybe had thought?
For example, California has a lot of resources to fund electric school buses and electric vehicles, but some other states just don't have those resources.","With the start of the new federal fiscal year on Oct. 1 came the end of a tax credit school districts had been using to electrify their fleets of buses.

The Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act allocated money for clean energy vehicles, including electric school buses. It was supposed to last through the end of 2032, but the One Big Beautiful Bill Act ended them at the end of September.

According to the Electric School Bus Initiative, Arizona districts had nearly 230 electric school buses committed, but only 49 that either have been delivered or are operating.

With the tax credit ending, those numbers — both in Arizona and around the country — may not see much increase.

Julia Gentin has covered climate education at The Hechinger Report. She joined The Show to discuss the status of states, districts and schools that were banking on being able to change out some of their bus fleets to electric?

Full conversation

JULIA GENTIN: Well, basically under the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act, schools were going to be able to have this tax credit for electric vehicles for the next seven years. So, it was set to expire in 2032. But now, under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, or H.R. 1, any electric vehicle that is acquired after September 30 of this year, 2025, will not be eligible for tax credits.

MARK BRODIE: So does that mean that there are likely going to be fewer electric school buses on the roads around the country than districts maybe had thought?

GENTIN: Yeah, for schools that have already purchased their buses but not yet received them, they are going to be OK and they can still continue to receive that tax credit because they've entered into this contract and purchased the buses. But for schools that have had considered for more long term, you know, adding the electric school buses, they will not be able to receive the tax credit if they haven't been purchased by Sept. 30.

BRODIE: Do you have a sense of how many buses or what percentage of electric school buses this might entail, in terms of districts that had been hoping to have them that will not be able to get them because they don't have the tax incentive anymore?

GENTIN: I would say I don't have a number on that, but the amount that it could affect per vehicle from the loss of these tax credits would be about $40,000. So for districts that were considering, or who had these in more of a long-term net zero energy-type resolution, they would not be able to count on federal funding anymore in that form.

BRODIE: What did some of the districts with whom you spoke for your reporting tell you that they planned to do?

GENTIN: Well, I talked to the Los Angeles Unified School District. So this is outside of Arizona, but they were at first really worried because the wording in H.R. 1 had initially been interpreted as ""buses placed into service"" and they weren't supposed to receive buses. They just got a notification that it was going to be before the first quarter of 2026, but they didn't know when they were coming.

So, they were really worried because they had already purchased these buses and were hoping to get the 30% of those costs covered by the Inflation Reduction Act-era tax credits. But then they thought that they couldn't anymore. The good thing is, on Aug. 15, there was sort of a rewording of that because I think the government realized there were a lot of districts in that same situation — where they had ordered the buses, but they hadn't come yet.

And that's something that Sue Gander at the World Resource Institute Electric School Bus Initiative was telling me — that there were a lot of school districts in that same situation that were stressed about when they would, they didn't know when they would get the buses. But luckily, the new Treasury Department guidance said, ""OK, for schools in that situation, as long as you purchase the bus, you'll be OK.""

For Tucson, though, in their school district, they had already gotten — I think — a 10-bus fleet. That was in Nov. 2024. So, that was through funding from the federal government, but a slightly different bucket of funding. It was the Environmental Protection Agency's Clean School Bus Program. But that, for most districts, only covered about two-thirds of the funding, and the remaining one-third was to be covered by this federal tax credit.

BRODIE: What are folks in the advocacy world supporting the adoption of more electric school buses saying about what kind of impact the loss of this tax credit might have?

GENTIN: Well, I think I said before this, but the loss of that tax credit could impact around $40,000 per vehicle. So, that means across the country there are more than half a million buses transporting 21 million kids to school. And there are all sorts of environmental impacts that come with these diesel- or fossil-fueled buses.

So, the hope was that the transition could continue, but now it's more of like, telling districts, ""you have to get these buses as soon as possible; otherwise, you won't be able to receive tax credits for them and you won't be able to electrify your fleet."" So, I think it will delay a lot of the electrification processes and the majority — this 90% of fossil fuel diesel school buses — will continue operating.

BRODIE: Does it seem as though advocates think this really is just a delay and not sort of the ending of this effort to electrify fleets?

GENTIN: It seems like districts still have hope and advocates still have hope that there could be some other funding sources that they look to to fill that gap. However, the Environmental Protection Agency's Clean School Bus Program, I believe, is expiring in two years. So that's, that's another setback. But for the portion that was covered by the clean energy tax credits, these federal tax credits, they are hoping to replace with either local sources of funding or state sources of funding.

But some states are more fortunate than others. For example, California has a lot of resources to fund electric school buses and electric vehicles, but some other states just don't have those resources.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/596f246/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5150x2704+0+1243/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fd7%2F56%2Fd190939e4f8fb5bf7fdad76d2634%2Fjulia-gentin-20251014.jpeg,N,,2025-10-14 17:03:53.057174

From the September / October 2025 Issue

Connecticut has long been a haven for original ideas and fresh thinking, and this drive toward the future has made the state home to acclaimed scientists, inventors, and creators, producing the first functional helicopter, anesthesia, and color television. Wide-ranging talent and a strong business ecosystem with access to major east coast markets make this New England state a strong location choice for both U.S.-based and foreign companies.

Globally recognized brands like ESPN, Xerox and Cigna have made their headquarters in Connecticut, as have startups like Yale University quantum computing spinoff Quantum Circuits, Inc. For companies both large and small, Connecticut has the talent and the business climate to fuel their growth.

Centrally located in the northeast U.S., Connecticut offers businesses a location adjacent to New York City, within two hours of Boston, and ease of access to markets throughout the U.S. and Canada. Along with three deep water ports and an international airport, Connecticut also boasts strong passenger and freight rail and interstate distribution networks.

The state’s robust infrastructure extends into energy and communication networks. And, whether it’s highway improvements, rail enhancements, or investments in EV charging stations, Connecticut prioritizes infrastructure resilience to support businesses.

Business Facilities recently spoke with Governor Ned Lamont, who took office in January 2019, about the latest for business and residents in Connecticut and his administration’s recent actions.

Business Facilities: When it comes to the business climate in Connecticut, what are highlights you’d share with site selection teams?

Governor Ned Lamont: Over the past two years, Connecticut has seen significant growth and expansion in our advanced manufacturing sector, which is a hugely positive sign. Our corporate investors are getting the workforce and support they need in our state, so they are doubling down on their investments.

We have also seen a rise in foreign direct investment as companies that supply our advanced manufacturing primes open operations closer to their clients. We had South Korea-based Hanwha Aerospace relocate its International Engines Business headquarters to Connecticut and Germany-based MTU Aero Engines expand their workforce, both doing so in part to better serve their major Connecticut customers, like Pratt and Whitney.

Connecticut is a low-risk location, and we value our corporate partners. Our companies see this support in tangible ways that benefit their businesses, so they value the partnerships and stability that our state offers.

These advantages have led to the investment and expansion of companies like semiconductor machine manufacturer ASML—arguably the most important player in the global microchip supply chain; mission systems, RF component, and advanced printed circuit boards manufacturer TTM Technologies; global cross-border payments fintech firm Banking Circle; and world-leading inhaled pharmaceutical solutions company MannKind.

BF: What incentives and other programs are being emphasized for new and existing business in Connecticut?

Gov. Lamont: Connecticut’s incentives are “earn as you grow” focused and bespoke, depending on the nature of the company’s operations. We do not offer broad incentives for all corporate investments and expansions but may assist those who can demonstrate a commitment to creating good-paying jobs for Connecticut residents.

We rolled out the Strategic Supply Chain Initiative earlier this year, which aims to support the growth and attraction of strategically important supply chain companies that contribute to Connecticut’s core industries. The goal of this program is to help companies increase their capacity to not only create more business for themselves, but also to promote onshoring and attract new supply chain operations, both domestically and internationally, to Connecticut.

BF: What is a key challenge or issue facing Connecticut in terms of business attraction and economic development? How is your administration addressing the issue?

Gov. Lamont: Despite having to compete with neighboring states like New York and Massachusetts, we see economic opportunities and advantages. Connecticut has made significant improvements over the past few years when it comes to net migration and the dynamism of our corporate ecosystem, alongside our continued, unparalleled access to top-tier talent and quality of life. We’ve been working tirelessly to sharpen our competitive edge through fact-based campaigns and policies that have increasingly been gaining traction on the national stage, resulting in new businesses moving and growing here.

Connecticut is small enough to make doing business here extremely easy. With an accessible governmental structure and responsive industry organizations, companies can be close to their customers throughout the mid-Atlantic and northeast—and even Canada—while ensuring they receive the support and services that they need to continue to grow. This is the true story of our state’s business environment, and it’s a reality that many companies in the industries of the future have bought into and thrived in. Few other states can offer what we offer in terms of workforce, quality of life, and location.

BF: What else would you share with businesses considering Connecticut?

Gov. Lamont: Business leaders shouldn’t rely on outdated perceptions. They should reach out and sit with our team from AdvanceCT and the Department of Economic and Community Development. Come see for yourself, because you’ll be missing out on an amazing opportunity if you don’t explore Connecticut’s assets. If you’re a company seeking a skilled workforce or manufacturing anything that requires immense precision, knowledge, and expertise, Connecticut is the answer to your business needs.",https://businessfacilities.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pg-45-photo-hanwha-gnl_web.jpg,N,,2025-10-14 16:02:02.860067

GM reported the loss to the Securities and Exchange Commission as what’s known as an impairment charge. Impairment charges reflect assets that are not expected to bring in profits as initially expected.

GM “made significant investments and contractual commitments in the development of electric vehicles (EVs) to help the Company’s vehicle fleet comply with emissions and fuel economy regulations that were scheduled to become increasingly stringent,” according to a company filing.

“Following recent U.S. Government policy changes, including the termination of certain consumer tax incentives for EV purchases and the reduction in the stringency of emissions regulations, we expect the adoption rate of EVs to slow,” according to GM’s filing. “These developments have caused us to reassess our EV capacity and manufacturing footprint.”

GM executives have continued to call electrification the company’s “North Star.” But, along with other EV makers, the company has been shaken this year by Republicans’ removal of a $7,500 tax credit for EV buyers and lessees, as well as Trump’s efforts to pull back federal rules limiting vehicle greenhouse gas emissions.

GM more than doubled its electric vehicle sales in the third quarter compared with the same period a year ago, largely due to drivers hoping to take advantage of the tax credits before they expired Sept. 30. Analysts predict a steep drop-off in EV sales in the coming months.

Interest in EVs among U.S. drivers, while increasing, is also doing so at a far slower pace than many in the industry expected.

The bulk of GM’s impairment charge — $1.2 billion — represents machinery and other equipment to make EVs that is now sitting unused. The other $400 million is mostly from canceled contracts with suppliers to provide GM with more parts, materials and equipment than it now can use.",https://thumb.spokesman.com/hr509cRCuaANjcJaG6nEzG9YK7U=/1200x630/smart/media.spokesman.com/photos/2025/10/14/68ee9dfc8d602.hires.jpg,N,,2025-10-14 17:05:04.882421

The state Chamber of Commerce and Manufacturers Alliance will form South Carolina Manufacturers and Commerce, which will represent more than 900 business owners. The merger will officially take effect Jan. 1.

“Both organizations for decades have worked together on a variety of issues, and this was an opportunity to come together and build an organization that’s just bigger, better and stronger together,” said Sara Hazzard, who will lead the combined group.

The combined organization will build on major investments companies have made in the state in recent years, such as the $2 billion Scout Motors electric vehicle assembly plant just north of Columbia, said Hazzard, who has led the Manufacturers Alliance since 2018.

The two advocacy groups tossed around the idea of becoming one for years, but with the recent momentum, the time seemed right, Hazzard said.

The combined advocacy group is still hammering out the specifics of its policy goals, leaders said. At the top of the agenda will be pushes to reform the state’s taxes to be more competitive for business, increase access to affordable energy, reform the way lawsuits are handled, and ensure residents have the skills to enter the workforce, Hazzard said.

“At the end of the day, we’re just trying to find these views that help move South Carolina forward, for the people of South Carolina, for the businesses of South Carolina, and what will help take us forward into the future,” Hazzard said.

Gov. Henry McMaster, House Speaker Murrell Smith, R-Sumter, and Senate President Thomas Alexander, R-Walhalla, praised the merger as a way of pushing for the needs of the business community.

Officials emphasize that the EAP benefit is not intended to cover a household’s entire annual energy cost.
April 20, 2026: The EAP application period closes at 5 p.m.
Applicants who have received a disconnection notice should immediately inform their utility provider that an EAP application has been submitted.","With the winter heating season frigidly creeping around the corner, the Indiana Housing and Community Development Authority (IHCDA) has announced the opening of the application period for its Energy Assistance Program (EAP), a vital resource for low-income households facing high utility expenses.

The program accepts applications from October 1, 2025, through April 20, 2026.

The federally funded program, known nationally as the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), provides a one-time annual benefit paid directly to utility companies to help eligible residents manage their heating and electric bills. This assistance can be crucial for households at risk of disconnection or those already without service.

Understanding EAP eligibility

Indiana households with or below 60% of the state’s median income may qualify for assistance. Eligibility is determined based on the gross income of all household members from the most recent three-month period.

The following income guidelines, based on household size, will be in effect for the 2025-2026 program year:

1 person: $2,796 per month / $8,389 for three months

2 people: $3,656 per month / $10,970 for three months

3 people: $4,517 per month / $13,551 for three months

4 people: $5,377 per month / $16,133 for three months

5 people: $6,238 per month / $18,714 for three months

For each additional person, add approximately $860 to the monthly income limit. renters whose heat and electric costs are included in their monthly rent may also qualify for a benefit.

Officials emphasize that the EAP benefit is not intended to cover a household’s entire annual energy cost. Recipients should continue to pay their utility bills regularly to avoid falling behind. The benefit serves as a supplemental subsidy to alleviate the financial strain during the most expensive months.

How to apply for EAP

Prospective applicants have several options to submit their materials. They can apply online through a designated portal, submit a paper application by mail or apply in person by contacting their county’s designated Local Service Provider (LSP). These LSPs, often community action agencies like the MLK Center and John Boner Center, typically process all applications and determine final eligibility.

A critical note for residents of Adams, Blackford, Huntington, Jay, Randolph and Wells counties: a new online system, referred to as LITT, will be used for applications this year. These applicants must ensure they use the correct portal link, which will differ from the one used by residents of other Indiana counties.

The application season follows a specific timeline with key dates:

Oct. 1, 2025: Online applications open to the general public at 8:00 AM Eastern Time.

Nov. 1, 2025: Local Service Providers may begin scheduling in-person appointments, though appointments are not strictly required to apply.

Dec. 1, 2025: The statewide “Moratorium” period begins, offering protection from disconnection for eligible applicants.

March 15, 2026: The Moratorium period ends.

April 20, 2026: The EAP application period closes at 5 p.m. ET.

Consumer protections and EAP

A significant protection for Indiana residents is the winter moratorium law. From Dec. 1, 2025 through March 15, 2026, regulated utility companies are prohibited from disconnecting residential service for any customer who has applied for and is eligible for EAP. Applicants who have received a disconnection notice should immediately inform their utility provider that an EAP application has been submitted.

For households in a heating crisis — such as receiving a disconnection notice, already being disconnected or having a bulk fuel tank at 10% capacity or less — the response is accelerated. LSPs are required to provide a mitigating action within 48 hours. In life-threatening situations involving a disconnected utility and a documented medical need, the response time is shortened to 18 hours.

Post-application EAP timeline and appeals

Applicants should be prepared for processing times. For standard applications submitted without an in-person appointment, LSPs have up to 55 days to determine eligibility. After a benefit is awarded, it can take utility companies an additional 30 days to process the payment. For direct-pay benefits, it may take up to 120 days for a check to be issued.

If an application is denied or a benefit is calculated incorrectly, applicants have the right to appeal. The appeal must be filed in writing with the Local Service Provider within 30 days of the denial. The LSP is then required to issue a written response within 14 calendar days. IHCDA advises applicants to first appeal to their LSP before escalating the matter to the state authority.

For more information, to find a Local Service Provider or to begin an application, residents are encouraged to visit the official IHCDA website or contact the Community Programs team at eap@ihcda.in.gov. While the 211 helpline can no longer complete applications over the phone, it remains a valuable resource for information on other community assistance programs.",https://indianapolisrecorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2158183627-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-14 16:02:08.382415

From politics and incentives to a Moore’s Law–like evolution in battery efficiency and charging speed, to fire safety improvements being designed into these vehicles, disruption remains the one constant. What does this likelihood mean for the intelligent future-proofer? Common sense. Reasonably, we can anticipate that plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, even while they serve as a transitional solution, may have their role diminish over time.

In contrast, BEVs will go farther and charge faster at the DC Fast Level, but the demand to plug in while parked is sure to persist for many years to come. The percentage of parking spaces that need to be dedicated and the corresponding charging speed (Level 1, Level 2, DC Fast) is not fully known today and is likely to increase over time. Worse still, politicians love misguided mandates, local fire commissioners have their own opinions, and headlines on this topic are frequently misleading. High-level takeaway: Take a market-based approach and ensure that flexibility is built in for the future.

Circulation and layout

The emergence of autonomous vehicles (AVs) is rapidly transforming what was once science fiction into an impending reality. Although the precise timeline for widespread AV adoption remains uncertain, the vehicles’ impact on parking design will be as profound as it will be subtle. What we can reasonably predict is that we will neither transition to a world where all vehicles are self-driving taxis, nor will we end up in an environment where our vehicles take us to our destination, return home, and then pick us up when we are ready to leave.

Thus, this evolution necessitates a fundamental rethinking of how parking facilities are conceived and operated. Once again, future-proofing requires us to look beyond the headlines and think practically about how we can adapt to new technology. The impact of AVs on urban landscapes will occur inside the parking garage, where drop-off zones will allow passengers to disembark on the entry level before the car departs and parks itself, waiting nearby to be summoned for the return trip.

VIPs will pay extra to have their vehicle stored by the main entrance, ready at a moment’s notice to take them to their next destination. At the same time, the economically minded will send their cars to the nether reaches of the parking garage and will have to remember to summon them a few minutes in advance of their departure. As with overstay fees at EV chargers, parking operators will start charging for dwell times in pickup and drop-off zones.

Unlike a human driver, an AV navigates and interacts with its environment through sophisticated sensors and algorithms, demanding a different set of design considerations. They include creating AV–friendly lanes and entry/exit points, where pathways are clearly defined, are potentially wider, and allow more gentle turning radii to facilitate seamless, automated access. Crucially, traditional human-readable signage and visual cues will be supplanted by the need for machine-readable markers and robust digital communication protocols, alongside supporting infrastructure, ensuring that AVs can reliably interpret their surroundings and execute maneuvers.

Beyond accommodating AVs themselves, future-proof parking facilities must also integrate designated zones for new mobility solutions. The rise of transit network companies such as Uber and Lyft has already demonstrated the need for dedicated pickup and drop-off areas, which means moving these activities from busy curbsides into more organized spaces.

Looking ahead, the mobility landscape is expected to diversify even further by incorporating shared autonomous vehicles, last-mile delivery bots, and micro-mobility options such as e-scooters and bicycles. A forward-thinking design will strategically reserve flexible areas within the parking facility to accommodate these evolving needs, transforming garages into dynamic mobility hubs that serve a broad spectrum of transportation demands.

The evolution of wayfinding

Just as parking facility layouts must evolve to accommodate autonomous vehicles, so, too, must the systems that guide users through these complex environments. For decades, wayfinding in a parking garage was a static, and often confusing, affair of painted arrows and cryptic signage, open entirely to human interpretation. Today, technology has profoundly transformed the user experience and moved beyond mere static directions to offer dynamic, real-time guidance for both human-driven and self-driving vehicles.

Although traditional signage remains a necessary component for redundancy and basic navigation, especially for human drivers, the game has undergone a fundamental change with the advent of digital systems. Digital signage, strategically placed throughout a facility, can provide real-time information on parking availability and pricing, and can even direct drivers to specific open spaces. This real-time capability is crucial for maximizing efficiency and reducing congestion. Furthermore, advanced parking guidance systems, using networks of sensors or cameras, can monitor every space in a facility to provide a level of granular detail that was previously unimaginable.

Such rich data can then be seamlessly fed to mobile applications, in-dash navigation systems, and—crucially—directly to autonomous vehicles. This sort of feed allows users—whether human or AI—to plan their entire parking journey even before they arrive, and to navigate the facility with unparalleled precision. The result is a significantly more efficient and less stressful experience for the user, coupled with a more optimized, profitable operation for the owner, as spaces are used more effectively and traffic flow is streamlined.",https://cdn-ul.uli.org/dims4/default/8620e3a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/792x446+0+83/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk2-prod-uli.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F96%2F48%2F6167a3a242b58e343d7ebb5862d1%2Fparkonomics-ev-charging-rgb.png,N,,2025-10-14 19:02:45.323230

Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat representing Rhode Island, held a roundtable in Raleigh on Tuesday to address climate change driving up insurance costs.
Whitehouse said his home state of Rhode Island faces some of the same environmental challenges as North Carolina.
She referenced Hurricane Helene sweeping through western North Carolina last year and sending floodwaters through the mountainous terrain at an unprecedented level.
A poll found that 92% of voters in Texas are worried about the costs of their home insurance rising due to severe weather like hurricanes and flooding, Whitehouse said, referencing a roundtable he held in Houston in August.
Dan Crawford, senior director of public affairs at the NCLCV, said North Carolina is on the front lines of this conversation.","U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat representing Rhode Island, held a roundtable in Raleigh on Tuesday to address climate change driving up insurance costs.

Speaking at the Walnut Creek Wetlands Center, Whitehouse joined U.S. Rep. Deborah Ross (NC-02), the North Carolina League of Conservation Voters and Partners for Environmental Justice to address concerns from local experts, community leaders and residents.

Whitehouse is in his fourth term in the Senate. He has served as the ranking member of the Committee on Environment and Public Works since January 2025.

Whitehouse said his home state of Rhode Island faces some of the same environmental challenges as North Carolina. Rhode Island is subject to rain bursts — sudden amounts of precipitation in a short period of time — that can flood rivers and overwhelm sewage treatment facilities. The Ocean State also has rising sea levels, coastal storms, and erosion.

“Those are familiar topics to you here in North Carolina – upland river flooding from rain bursts and coastal erosion and storms tearing away at your coastal communities,” Whitehouse said.

Flooding, storm water, and storm control are familiar issues to Ross’s constituents in the second congressional district, she said, but they are less common in other parts of the state.

She referenced Hurricane Helene sweeping through western North Carolina last year and sending floodwaters through the mountainous terrain at an unprecedented level.

“It is a new [issue] to the North Carolina mountains and to many other areas in this country that are feeling the effects of climate change that have been spreading and worsening over time,” Ross said.

This raises costs for homeowners insurance, according to Whitehouse. He talked about insurance companies deeming properties too risky due to concerns with climate change, which then leads to increased rates for families.

A poll found that 92% of voters in Texas are worried about the costs of their home insurance rising due to severe weather like hurricanes and flooding, Whitehouse said, referencing a roundtable he held in Houston in August.

“This is actually everywhere, and it opens a new era of a climate conversation that will give us the political power to solve the problem before it gets devastatingly worse,” he said.

Dan Crawford, senior director of public affairs at the NCLCV, said North Carolina is on the front lines of this conversation. He said the state now has the third highest rate of property insurance policy cancellations in the country.

In some coastal counties, more than one in 10 homeowners lost their coverage in 2023, he said.

“The message is clear: You can’t solve the insurance crisis without also addressing the climate crisis,” Crawford said. “Rising risk means rising cost, and unless we take action to make our communities more resilient and reduce the pollution driving these disasters, North Carolinians will continue to pay that price.”

Community members at the roundtable shared stories of losing a business in Chapel Hill due to flooding and neighborhoods being destroyed from Tropical Storm Chantal in July.

Others expressed concerns over policy, especially with cuts to resources like the National Weather Service, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and the National Flood Insurance Program.

Whitehouse said the NFIP “isn’t sound or fair now” and needs restructuring. Improvements should include better mapping, allowing people to know when they’re really at risk, and options for people to be able to get assistance to relocate before they have to rebuild their homes, he said.

“The whole program is failing right now, and so a very significant redo is required, but transparency and consumer options are two of the key pieces to make it right,” he told NC Newsline.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_4255-1-2048x1536.jpg,N,,2025-10-14 15:03:28.346260

GM sold a record number of EVs in the third quarter, second only to Tesla in overall U.S. EV sales.

But it's expecting a downturn with the tax credits gone, and without fuel economy penalties, it's no longer under the gun to keep growing its EV business.

On paper, General Motors should be the envy of the American automotive industry. It now sells more electric vehicles across more segments and price points than any other manufacturer, from luxury pickup trucks to, soon, the sub-$30,000 Chevrolet Bolt. It's been running second to Tesla in U.S. EV sales for some time now, and in the third quarter of this year, it easily passed the total electric sales it saw in all of 2024.

All of that feels like a big win. So why did EVs force GM to announce an unexpected $1.6 billion hit?

Despite strong electric sales this year, GM officials today said that without the EV tax credit, the carmaker is expecting far less demand than it's seen thus far. That means retooling its factories to avoid an excess of EV inventory it can't sell—as well as to make more profitable gas-powered cars.

""Following recent U.S. government policy changes, including the termination of certain consumer tax incentives for EV purchases and the reduction in the stringency of emissions regulations, we expect the adoption rate of EVs to slow,"" the carmaker announced in a regulatory filing posted today. Like any publicly traded company, GM is required to list such unexpected charges with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. ""These charges include non-cash impairment and other charges of $1.2 billion as a result of adjustments to our EV capacity.""

GM announced another $400 million in charges ""related to contract cancellation fees and commercial settlements associated with EV-related investments,"" bringing the grand total to $1.6 billion. The news was reported by Bloomberg and other outlets.

Put simply, these charges show that it's expensive for a big, global carmaker like GM to adjust what cars it's producing at its factories, and at what pace. So even with impressive EV sales—about 145,000 through Q3—it's anticipating a downturn when people can't take advantage of tax credits, and it's having to make some changes.

This whiplash is expensive. And ""whiplash"" is the best way to describe how car companies made big pushes for electric cars and batteries made domestically under the Biden administration. Those years brought America both the EV tax credit and stricter fuel economy rules that were driving a largely electric new-car market in this country by the 2030s. Then everything changed.

Gallery: 2025 Cadillac Optiq

The EV market reality never quite lined up with carmakers' rosy projections, and even before Biden left office, sales were often uneven at best. The Trump administration then yanked the rug out from GM and every other car company operating in the U.S. As of Sept. 30, they'll no longer have the EV tax credit to encourage sales. And they'll no longer have to pay any fines related to fuel economy rules, but they will have to pay steep duties on electric models imported from other countries.

Granted, that doesn't give GM a pass to stick an LS3 engine under the hood of every family crossover it makes. The carmaker knows it faces a mostly electric future someday, and deep down, any executive there will tell you that it'll deal with fuel economy regulations at some point again. (GM President Mark Reuss elaborated on this and more on this week's episode of the InsideEVs Plugged-In Podcast, which airs Friday.)

But for now, it's able to slow down. And while some competitors are issuing fire-sale price cuts on their EVs, GM has said not to expect any ""irrational"" discounts.

Slowing EV sales is certainly bad news for combating climate change and air pollution in America. And if all carmakers in the U.S. also slow down on their EV-related R&D investments, it leaves them caught behind far more advanced newcomers, like China's auto brands. Yet this $1.6 billion charge is a reflection of the financial realities involved with planning for years of investments in one area, and then having the federal government completely reverse course.

The Trump administration has certainly been no friend to EVs. But administration officials have argued that ending the so-called ""EV mandate"" and effectively killing fuel economy rules will make cars more affordable. Given that the average new car price rose past $50,000 for the first time in September, and that automakers are dealing with staggering tariff costs—GM's own bill was $1.1 billion just in the second quarter—that seems rather unlikely in the short term.

It's enough to make you wonder who's actually winning in this scenario.

Opening the session, Stewart Maginnis, IUCN Deputy Director General, underscored the urgency: “The renewable energy transition will define the trajectory of our planet. We must build quickly to meet climate goals — but we cannot afford to sacrifice nature in the process. Energy security, climate stability, and nature conservation are not competing priorities, but interdependent imperatives.”

A global dialogue on energy, nature, and people

Speakers recognised the need for smarter, more inclusive planning as renewable energy deployment accelerates — growing by more than 15% each year.

Ralph Regenvanu, Minister for Climate Change Adaptation, Energy, Environment, Meteorology, Geo-hazards and Disaster Management, Vanuatu, highlighted the nation’s goal of achieving 100% renewable electricity access by 2030, stressing that “citizens are key” to realising this vision.

Panama’s Minister of Environment, Juan Carlos Navarro, reminded the audience that “renewables are here to stay”. With nearly 78% of Panama’s electricity already from renewable sources, he called for massive investments in intelligent, AI-driven grids to meet surging global energy demand, including that from data centres. “We need grids that are smarter than we are,” he added, “to provide energy efficiently with minimal environmental impact.”

Manuel Pulgar-Vidal, IUCN Climate Crisis Commission Interim Chair, World Wildlide Fund Climate & Energy Lead, introduced the country’s guiding principle of “deploying by enhancing” — advancing renewables while strengthening ecosystem protection. He called for an “ecological transition” that connects environmental, energy, and finance ministries and rethinks fossil fuel subsidies and outdated contracts. “We are a tiny piece in a big machinery,” he said. “To succeed, we must reform governance, link biodiversity with energy policy, and bring people into the heart of this transition.”

From Japan, Wataru Suzuki, Director, Biodiversity Strategy Office, Nature Conservation Bureau, Ministry of the Environment, emphasised the importance of trust and community participation. “Our environment ministry is small,” he said, “but we must be smart — combining renewable and conservation targets and ensuring that local communities share the benefits .” Japan aims to raise renewables to 50% by 2040, but must navigate the challenge of balancing solar expansion with the protection of cultural landscapes.

Oliver Conz, Director-General, Federal Ministry for the Environment, Climate Action, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety, Germany, shared lessons from one of the world’s fastest renewable transitions, underscoring the central role of spatial planning and strong biodiversity safeguards.

“Every dollar spent on planning is an investment in the future,” he said. “Protected areas are no-go zones. Everyone signing a permit must ensure they are not signing the extinction of a species.”

He also noted that biodiversity challenges predate renewables — and that clean energy is too often blamed for historical declines. “We must acknowledge this and plan renewables where they are most effective,” he said.

Accelerating the transition wisely

IRENA’s Deputy Director General, Gauri Singh, warned that while renewable deployment is accelerating by 15% each year, the “sleeping giant” is transmission — the vast expansion of electricity grids needed to connect new power to people.

“The glamour is in the solar farms and wind turbines,” she said, “but the real challenge is in the grids. Without communities, this is not a revolution that can be sustainable.”

Singh stressed the need for ministries of environment and energy to “speak the same language,” and called for greater attention to the full lifecycle of renewable infrastructure, including end-of-life management. She noted that GINGR will play a critical role in helping countries apply practical, nature-positive siting guidelines and governance models.

Across interventions, ministers agreed that the transition must not only be fast — it must also be fair, inclusive, and locally grounded.

Putting people at the centre

As Tinne Van der Straeten concluded: “The Swiss knife to break silos is to talk about people — by people, with people. That’s how we change hearts and minds.”

From Vanuatu’s communities striving for universal access, to Germany’s lessons in planning, the GINGR dialogue underscored that Nature- and People-Positive renewables are not a contradiction — they are the only viable path forward.",https://iucn.org/sites/default/files/2025-10/gingr-final-photo.jpg,N,,2025-10-14 15:02:49.289955

“We need to fix charging to sell EVs, to take internal combustion engine cars off the road over time and avoid emissions,” Buckberg said.
Realities for drivers According to Buckberg, most electric vehicles on the market have a range of 230 miles or more on a single charge.
“That might be a problem.” At present, Buckberg said, most EV owners are also homeowners with access to at-home charging.
According to Buckberg, this investment is crucial to increasing the share of EVs on the road and reaping the environmental benefits.","Compared to gasoline-powered cars, electric vehicles can save money at the pump, produce less harmful emissions, and avoid high maintenance costs. Why then, are so few Americans switching to EVs? The main reason, according to Elaine Buckberg, senior fellow at Harvard’s Salata Institute for Climate and Sustainability, is the hassle of charging on the go.

In a recent talk at Harvard Kennedy School, Buckberg, a former chief economist for General Motors, explored the realities of commuting with an electric vehicle, and why the lack of charging infrastructure is preventing the shift in consumer behavior needed to reduce transportation emissions.

Transportation accounts for 28 percent of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, and light-duty vehicles like passenger cars account for a total of 17 percent.

“We need to fix charging to sell EVs, to take internal combustion engine cars off the road over time and avoid emissions,” Buckberg said.

Realities for drivers

According to Buckberg, most electric vehicles on the market have a range of 230 miles or more on a single charge. For most Americans, that’s an average week of driving.

But consumers aren’t thinking about their daily, or even weekly, habits when considering making the switch to an electric vehicle, said Buckberg. What car buyers want is a vehicle that can reliably take them on a cross-country trip should the need arise.

“What if some weekend, they needed to take both kids and drop them off in different places, one at a soccer match and one had, I don’t know, dance competition, and they were both long-distance,” she said. “That might be a problem.”

At present, Buckberg said, most EV owners are also homeowners with access to at-home charging. But public infrastructure — which would be crucial to expand EV ownership — is still spotty.

“So people who can’t charge at home, or maybe can’t also charge in their workplace, they’re really going to rely on public charging,” she said. “That’s generally city dwellers and renters.”

Publicly available chargers — including both Level 2, which take roughly three to five hours to reach a full charge, and fast chargers that can reach a nearly full charge in around 20 minutes — currently sit at around 61,000 across the country, according to Buckberg. That’s up from 46,000 last year.

“But not nearly keeping up with the stock of EVs,” she added.

For comparison, there are more than double the amount of gas-fueling stations in the U.S. — many with multiple pumps for use.

Buckberg added that there is little reliability in a charger working, and a lack of real-time data for drivers. According to her research, only 34 percent of charging stations share real-time data that apps like Chargepoint and PlugShare use to inform their users on where to plug in. On some of the highways her team has studied, the gaps in available data exceed 1,300 miles.

“There’s no one-stop app to find chargers, which means it can be hard to find out whether a charger is working,” she said. “Who’s responsible? Who do you tell when it’s broken? So they don’t get fixed.”

Potential policy solutions

Currently, the federal government is not prioritizing increasing EV purchasing, as has been a trend in recent years, she said. It has cut incentive programs, including tax credits and spending programs, to improve availability of real-time charger data for drivers.

According to Buckberg, this investment is crucial to increasing the share of EVs on the road and reaping the environmental benefits. Her research shows that universal real-time data on highway fast chargers would raise new EV sales by 6.4 percentage points in 2030 — or 3.5 million additional EVs on the road in 2030 compared to the status quo. That would grow the overall share of EVs on the road by 15 percent and in turn create a reduction in emissions of about 15 million metric tons, she said.

“Data transparency could cure range anxiety,” she said in her talk. “Imagine that you could go to Google Maps, you could go to Apple Maps, you could go to whatever is the killer new EV app, and you could get reliable information.”

But there is still hope, she said. In partnership with scholars Ari Peskoe, Carrie Jenks, and Eliza Martin at Harvard Law School, Buckberg’s team has developed example legislation for state governments that would establish common standards for EV-charging providers to increase the reliability of their data.

“No expensive federal investment or tax credits,” she said. “It’s a really cheap option at a time where we’ve got pullback of federal incentives that would raise the number of registered EVs.”

And, Buckberg said, having states take the lead would reduce resistance for charging providers that have not made sharing data a priority.

“From a state perspective, this could be justified because it yields benefits at very low cost,” she said.",https://news.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/090524_Elaine_Buckberg_07.jpg,N,,2025-10-14 16:00:26.339621

While the school is pushing the full implementation further down the timeline, actions have been taken to begin the process of converting.

School administrators decided on purchasing some electric buses for the district following a second vote that was held in March 2025. This was done in partnership with the 2023 Environmental Protection Agency rebate program. This program allowed for 90% of associated costs to be covered. Reyda noted that the school purchased two electric buses during this time, which are expected to arrive sometime during this summer. The district has been partnering with both Young and Wright Architectural and Leonard Bus Company. These companies have been hard at work ensuring that the chargers will be ready at the district’s garage in time for the arrival of the buses, said Reyda.

However, the school will inevitably need to invest in many more electric buses to comply with changing regulations. In April 2022, the N.Y. state Legislature passed a budget that was signed by Governor Kathy Hochul. This budget created deadlines for transitioning to electric buses that state schools must comply with. The New York State Energy Research and Development Authority stated that all buses purchased by 2027 must be zero-emissions buses, and that entire fleets must be zero-emission by 2035. N.Y. state took a vote in 2022 that overwhelmingly supported the Clean Air, Clean Water, And Green Job Environmental Bond Act. The bond act provided $500 million to schools to aid in the transition to zero-emission buses. These funds are dispersed through vouchers given out by the New York State School Bus Incentive Program.

The dedicated assistance has definitely allowed this transition to be more of a reality for smaller rural schools with less resources, but many schools may still struggle to perform a full replacement of their bus fleet by this deadline. Reyda noted that the district is planning to submit an electric bus waiver to delay the mandate. This waiver will allow for less than the full implementation by the required deadlines.

Reyda stated that the waiver is not yet available to be submitted, due to the ongoing creation of specific guidelines and eligibility requirements. The waiver is expected to be available by Dec. 31, according to Reyda. Upon the release of the waiver, the school will submit a request that Reyda said should grant the district a couple more years to fully replace the bus fleet.",https://ogden_images.s3.amazonaws.com/www.post-journal.com/images/2025/10/13214240/Electric-School-Bus-01-667x500.jpg,N,,2025-10-14 18:02:47.510288

As promised, the Trump administration and its congressional Republican allies killed off as many of the clean energy and EV incentives as they could after taking power in January. Ironically, though, the end of the clean vehicle tax credit on September 30 actually spurred the sales of EVs, as customers rushed to dealerships to take advantage of the soon-to-disappear $7,500 credit.

Predictions for EV sales going forward aren't so rosy, and automakers are reacting by adjusting their product portfolio plans. Today, General Motors revealed that will result in a $1.6 billion hit to its balance sheet when it reports its Q3 results late this month, according to its 8-K.

Q3 was a decent one for GM, with sales up 8 percent year on year and up 10 percent for the year to date. GM EV sales look even better: up 104 percent for the year to date compared to the first nine months of 2024, with nearly 145,000 electric Cadillacs, Chevrolets, and GMCs finding homes.

GM had hoped to finagle a way to extend the clean vehicle tax credit to its customers by buying them itself and then leasing them to customers. But strong opposition from Republican senator and car dealer Bernie Moreno (R-Ohio) and his colleague John Barasso (R-Wyo.) saw GM scrap this plan beyond the end of October.

Around the same time, GM's audit committee approved the $1.6 billion charge due to expectations that EV adoption will decrease in the US. $1.2 billion is due to changes to its EV production capacity, and another $400 million is the cash impact from canceling contracts with suppliers.

It might not be the only time, either. ""The reassessment of our EV capacity and manufacturing footprint, including our investments in our battery component manufacturing, is ongoing, and it is reasonably possible that we will recognize additional future material cash and non-cash charges that may adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows in the period in which they are recognized,"" the company wrote in its filing.

However, GM says that its strategic realignment will not affect the current EV portfolio, and it ""expect[s] these models to remain available to customers.""",https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2165725341-2560x1440.jpg,N,,2025-10-14 16:00:56.015671

The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has significantly increased approvals for oil and gas drilling permits during the Trump administration, according to new federal data. While approvals have surged, many operators plan to hold onto their permits until energy markets stabilize and long-term prices justify new production.

Industry leaders say the accelerated pace could help offset supply shortfalls when demand rebounds, but warn the backlog might create regulatory challenges for future administrations.

With money flooding in, developers are flocking to areas where a lot of data centers are already, like Northern Virginia's Data Center Alley and parts of Texas, according to the IEA.
And in Arizona, some cities have restricted water deliveries to facilities that use a lot of water, including data centers.
Compounding the concerns of data centers' environmental and economic impacts is frustration that tech companies aren't forthcoming about their operations.
Diorio says data center companies are trying to be ""responsible partners"" in the communities where they operate.","Google recently courted the township of Franklin, Ind., so that it could construct a giant campus to house the computer hardware that powers its internet business. But the company needed to rezone more than 450 acres in the Indianapolis suburb, and residents weren't having it.

Many were concerned the facility would consume huge amounts of water and electricity while delivering few local benefits. When a lawyer representing Google confirmed at a September public meeting that the company was pulling its data center proposal, cheers erupted from sign-waving residents.

Similar fights are happening around the United States. On one side are companies pouring billions of dollars into data centers, which increasingly are being built to support artificial intelligence models that promise to transform how people live and work. On the other side are residents who worry the construction spree will have dire consequences for the environment, power prices and surrounding communities.

How tech companies and government officials handle those concerns will shape the industry's future in the U.S. and the country's competitiveness, according to analysts and academics who track the AI industry.

Local opposition ""slowing down the development of the industry or distributing it in sort of weird regional patterns is probably the most overlooked potential outcome in this conversation,"" says Joseph Majkut, director of the energy security and climate change program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

Here's what you need to know about the data center and AI boom — and what's at stake.

What are data centers?

Data centers are big buildings that house computer hardware to store and process digital information. They essentially function as the backbone of the internet. Some of the largest cover more than a million square feet — the size of more than 17 football fields.

When you read this story, or send an email or transfer money from your bank account online, you're relying on data centers scattered around the world.

And that computing power has a big environmental footprint. A typical AI data center uses as much electricity as 100,000 households, and the largest under development will consume 20 times more, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). They also suck up billions of gallons of water for systems to keep all that computer hardware cool.

Why am I hearing so much about data centers right now?

Data centers have been around for decades. But there's an investment frenzy around AI right now that's fueling a construction boom.

That growth is being driven by AI investors seeking enormous profits, thanks to the rising interest in AI from individual consumers and businesses. Within two years of ChatGPT's launch in 2022, for example, around 40% of households in the U.S. and United Kingdom reported using AI chatbots, according to the IEA. Roughly the same share of large companies were using AI last year, up from around 15% in 2020, the agency said.

Tech companies are spending hundreds of billions of dollars on data centers and AI computer chips. They're betting that more people and businesses will use the technology in the future. By 2027, AI is expected to account for 28% of the global data center market, according to Goldman Sachs, more than double its current share.

Where are data centers being built?

With money flooding in, developers are flocking to areas where a lot of data centers are already, like Northern Virginia's Data Center Alley and parts of Texas, according to the IEA. But the agency said there are also signs that development is spreading into other markets, like Las Vegas, that offer affordable land, cheap electricity from renewable power plants and industry tax incentives.

The Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis said this month that ""a potential data center boom is just getting started"" in its district, which covers Minnesota, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota and parts of Michigan and Wisconsin.

""It definitely feels like we are starting to see the rollout of what these massive investments in data centers are potentially going to start to look like on the ground,"" says Melissa Scanlan, director of the Center for Water Policy at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.

What are the benefits of AI?

Artificial intelligence generally refers to computer systems that learn to carry out tasks that traditionally required human intelligence, like reasoning and decision-making, according to NASA.

Some AI is being used to make images and videos online. The IEA says it's also being deployed in the medical field, to rapidly map protein structures for drug development; in the energy industry to quickly detect pipeline leaks and manage electricity networks; and in weather forecasting, to produce more accurate outlooks.

To remain competitive, the U.S. needs to be able to respond to what the market demands, whether it's ""more AI in the form of robotics, or we want much more in the form of digital services to make professionals more productive,"" says Majkut of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""Then there's a variety of applications in the national security, cybersecurity realm where the U.S. having a strong lead in the best [AI] models, the best chips, I think, is also something we want to pursue.""

Does it matter if the data centers that train and run those AI models are located in the U.S.? There are certainly potential economic benefits, like construction jobs and local tax revenue. But some localities are giving up a portion of those payments by offering tax breaks to lure project developers.

""Because much of the upfront investment is about physical infrastructure, having that investment here is hugely beneficial to the American economy,"" says Andrew Chien, a professor of computer science at the University of Chicago and a senior scientist at Argonne National Laboratory. The challenge for communities is figuring out how to turn those initial investments into long-term benefits, Chien adds, like high-paying jobs.

Since it doesn't take many people to operate a data center, once they're built, the facilities don't usually support many permanent jobs.

What's driving the local pushback against data centers?

Some people don't want huge industrial facilities — and all the noise and light that comes with them — changing the character of their community.

But people are also concerned about data centers depleting local water supplies for their cooling systems, driving up electricity bills and worsening climate change if the facilities rely on fossil fuel power plants for the electricity they need. The IEA says climate pollution from the power plants that run data centers could more than double by 2035.

Consider what's happening around the Great Lakes, where Scanlan of the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee says there's a flurry of data center activity. The Great Lakes can be thought of as ""a giant pitcher of water with straws going into it"" from water utilities, business and power plants in eight states and two Canadian provinces, Scanlan says. The question is, how much more water can the lakes provide for data centers and the power plants needed to run them in the coming years?

In Georgia, some residents reported problems getting drinking water from their wells after a data center was built nearby. And in Arizona, some cities have restricted water deliveries to facilities that use a lot of water, including data centers.

Dan Diorio, vice president of state policy at the Data Center Coalition, an industry group, says companies have been working to reduce how much water their facilities consume. While some data centers use evaporative cooling systems in which water is lost as steam, others rely on closed-loop systems that use less water. A Google data center in Georgia uses treated wastewater for cooling and then returns it to the Chattahoochee River, Diorio said. And there's a push for waterless cooling systems.

""It's a balance between water and electricity,"" Diorio says. ""If you use more electricity to cool, you're going to use less water. If you use more water, you'll use less electricity.""

Rising electricity bills are also a major concern as data centers spike power demand in certain areas. An analysis by the Union of Concerned Scientists recently found that in 2024, homes and businesses in Illinois, Maryland, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and West Virginia faced $4.3 billion in additional costs from transmission projects that were needed to deliver power to data centers.

Diorio says the data center industry ""is fully committed to paying its full cost of service for electricity.""

Data centers aren't the only source of new power demand. The construction of factories and increased sales of electric vehicles and home appliances like electric stoves are also increasing the country's electricity needs.

Compounding the concerns of data centers' environmental and economic impacts is frustration that tech companies aren't forthcoming about their operations. Without more transparency around water and energy consumption, Scanlan says the public doesn't have the information it needs to make informed decisions about data center development.

Diorio says data center companies are trying to be ""responsible partners"" in the communities where they operate. But they sometimes worry that sharing information about their water and energy use could give rivals a competitive edge.

Are there other challenges to data center development?

The big challenge is having enough electricity to meet rising demand.

The Trump administration has been taking steps to limit development of renewable energy projects. Industry executives and analysts say renewables are crucial to boost power supplies because the projects can be built quickly, and they generate electricity that is relatively cheap.

Pavan Venkatakrishnan, an infrastructure fellow at the Institute for Progress, says there's a ""clear conflict"" between the administration's position on renewables and its desire to accelerate data center construction.

A White House spokesperson, Kush Desai, said in a statement that AI ""cannot be beholden to unreliable sources of energy that must be heavily subsidized to be economical. The Trump administration is focused on unleashing the forms of energy — from natural gas to nuclear — that do work and that do not need consistent government subsidies to power the next Golden Age for America.""

Solar and wind power coupled with large batteries to store electricity are reliable power sources. There's also widespread agreement among energy analysts and executives that natural gas and nuclear will play an important role in meeting new electricity demand. But they say those technologies can't be deployed quickly enough at scale right now to meet the country's immediate needs.

Chief executive Jim Farley recently said the market will be “way smaller than we thought.” —Jackie Snow contributed to this article.","The impact of falling government support for electric vehicles – and slower-than-expected take-up – was brought into sharp focus Tuesday, as General Motors said it will lose $1.6 billion from pulling back its production plans.

The Detroit automotive giant was one of the first to go big on EVs, announcing in 2021 that it would phase out gas and diesel cars globally by 2035. The announcement came shortly after former President Joe Biden took office pledging to boost EV sales. At one point it was planning to spend $30 billion on EVs by this year, including an all-electric lineup further down the track.

Now, things look very different. President Donald Trump ended federal tax credits that helped American buyers afford to buy expensive U.S.-made electric cars last month, while Chinese automakers have pulled off one of the fastest industrial takeovers in modern history by building about 70% of the world's EVs this year.

GM said Tuesday that about $1.2 billion of the charges were down to adjusting its EV capacity, but added that plans to address its manufacturing footprint are “ongoing”. That means it is “reasonably possible” that more costs could be on their way.

The other $400 million is down to cancelled contracts and settling other commercial arrangements linked to its EV investments, it said. Shares were down 1.6% in premarket trading.

“Following recent U.S. Government policy changes, including the termination of certain consumer tax incentives for EV purchases and the reduction in the stringency of emissions regulations, we expect the adoption rate of EVs to slow,” GM said in the filing.

GM said last month that it plans slower output of the Chevrolet Bolt, and is also scaling back producing its Cadillac Lyriq and Vistiq, saying at the time that it is “making strategic production adjustments in alignment with expected slower EV industry growth and customer demand.”

Ford has also cut investment, dropping models and taking a $1.9 billion charge last year. Chief executive Jim Farley recently said the market will be “way smaller than we thought.”

The work aims to reduce costs, improve safety and environmental performance, and guide federal energy policy related to deep-sea reservoirs.

The project is a collaboration between UH, Texas A&M University and Louisiana State University, uniting three leading Gulf Coast institutions to address one of the region’s most complex engineering challenges. The project will be managed by the Texas A&M Engineering Experiment Station.

“This research will help shape future government and industry policies on how we responsibly manage deep-sea reservoirs.”

— Ganesh Thakur, director of UH Energy Industrial Partnerships, University of Houston

As the recipient of four out of six grants associated with this project, the UH team will lead a majority of the work under the direction of Cullen College of Engineering Professors Ganesh Thakur, director of UH Energy Industrial Partnerships, and George Wong, graduate studies director at the school. The total funding for the entire project — a sum of $1.9 million — was approved on July 31 as part of the OESI Technical Response for Urgent and Significant Topics initiative.

“This research will help shape future government and industry policies on how we responsibly manage deep-sea reservoirs,” said Thakur. “Our goal is to make offshore production more sustainable, cost-effective and safe, benefitting both the energy industry and consumers.”

Driving Innovation with Purpose

The three teams will use advanced simulation and statistical analyses to identify the most effective production strategies for deepwater oil reservoirs. UH will focus primarily on non-Paleogene reservoirs — save for Wong, who will examine Paleogene reservoirs alongside Texas A&M and LSU.

By refining how reservoirs are managed and reducing the risk of damage during extraction, researchers hope to extend the life of offshore resources while minimizing environmental impact.

“You want to maximize recovery without harming the reservoir,” Thakur said. “If we can do that efficiently and responsibly, it’s a win-win situation – we produce more energy, safely and at lower cost.”

Thakur noted that the everyday person may not notice the impact of this work immediately, but said that over time, these innovations could help lower the overall cost of oil production – benefits that may eventually reach people’s wallets through more stable fuel prices.

“People may not feel it initially, but if it increases the oil production in the U.S. and lowers the cost of production, then the cost of gas at the pumps may go down,” he said. “Looking at the big picture, it’s a small but very important ripple effect.”

(AP) — Federal officials rejected a company’s bid to acquire 167 million tons of coal on public lands in Montana for less than a penny per ton, in what would have been the biggest U.S. government coal sale in more than a decade.

The failed sale underscores a continued low appetite for coal among utilities that are turning to cheaper natural gas and renewables such as wind and solar to generate electricity. Emissions from burning coal are a leading driver of climate change, which scientists say is raising sea levels and making weather more extreme.

President Donald Trump has made reviving the coal industry a centerpiece of his agenda to increase U.S. energy production. But economists say Trump’s attempts to boost coal are unlikely to reverse its yearslong decline.

The Department of Interior said in a Tuesday statement that last week’s $186,000 bid from the Navajo Transitional Energy Co. (NTEC) did not meet the requirements of the Mineral Leasing Act.

Agency representatives did not provide further details, and it’s unclear if they will attempt to hold the sale again.

The leasing act requires bids to be at or above fair market value. At the last successful government lease sale in the region, a subsidiary of Peabody Energy paid $793 million, or $1.10 per ton, for 721 million tons of coal in Wyoming.

President Joe Biden’s administration sought to end coal sales in the Powder River Basin of Montana and Wyoming, citing climate change.

A second proposed lease sale under Trump — 440 million tons of coal near an NTEC mine in central Wyoming — was postponed last week following the low bid received in the Montana sale. Interior Department officials have not said when the Wyoming sale will be rescheduled.

NTEC is owned by the Navajo Nation of Arizona, New Mexico and Utah.

In documents submitted in the run-up to the Montana sale, NTEC indicated the coal had little value because of declining demand for the fuel. The Associated Press emailed a company representative regarding the rejected bid.

Most power plants using fuel from NTEC’s Spring Creek mine in Montana and Antelope mine in Wyoming are scheduled to stop burning coal in the next decade, according to an analysis by The Associated Press.

Spring Creek also ships coal overseas to customers in Asia. Increasing those shipments could help it offset lessening domestic demand, but a shortage of port capacity has hobbled prior industry aspirations to boost coal exports.",https://www.louisianafirstnews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/80/2025/10/68ee728127c521.84282797.jpeg?w=1280,N,,2025-10-14 17:06:53.627214

According to the U.S. Department of Energy’s Grid Deployment Office, “Vegetation-related impacts to the power system are the most common cause of power outages in the U.S., accounting for more than twenty percent of incidents.” For many utilities, vegetation management is at or near the top of their O&M spending. Florida Power & Light Company’s 2023-2023 Storm Protection Plan states the utility will spend about $77 million per year on managing vegetation across 16,400 miles of distribution lines. Utility executives owe it to themselves and their rate payers and members to adopt a strategic approach to vegetation management.

“No one saves money on vegetation management by saving money on vegetation management,” says Dennis Fallon, executive director of the Utility Arborist Association. “Vegetation management needs to be thought of right out of the gate as one of the largest O&M line items for utilities across North America, maybe the world.”

A Systemwide Approach to Utility Vegetation Management

To reduce outages and save money, utilities must fund utility vegetation management, UVM, programs with a focus on their system instead of tamping down emergent conditions. A systemwide approach would include:

Funding consumer programs,

Deploying the latest pruning strategies, and

Increasing job site management.

Consumer Outreach

A couple of years ago, an investor-owned utility partnered with the Arbor Day Foundation to offer 1,000 trees to customers. Among the reasons the utility gave on its website for the program was that selecting the wrong tree can result in significant pruning, removal, or serious electric service interruptions. The program was an example of spending to educate customers about vegetation affecting power from outside the rights-of-ways.

Tech-enabled Strategies

Pruning strategies combined with technology like LiDAR, satellite imagery, A.I. and other software is also a lever for smartly deploying resources across a system. LiDAR can home in on areas where vegetation encroaches on conductors. Satellite imagery offers a wide-area view of dead or dying trees to help inspectors address hazards before they cause outages. The one-two punch puts crews where they’re needed most.

Job Oversight

The U.S. military often refers to technology as an enabler, something that supports human efforts rather than replacing them. JSM enables the work of UVM crews, helping them stay on task and budget. JSMs are in the field to liaise between contractors and a utility’s project manager. A JSM is the project manager’s eyes in the field and someone who anticipates what a crew needs to stay on task and budget.

“There’s always value in an independent review of anything,” notes Fallon. “If you have someone educated in vegetation management, who knows what confines the contractor, and understands the utility’s expectation, the extra eyes are valuable.”

A job site manager helps a UVM program manage its O&M spending, which, ultimately, helps rate payers or co-op members avoid bigger bills. Experts agree overseeing a project is about spotting what crews do well and encouraging more of the same. But a JSM also keeps tabs on what crews don’t accomplish, so they improve.

Cultivating Opportunities

Being strategic about UVM includes JSM (e.g., observing tree pruning), analyzing outage history, and investigating outages that could affect future practices and priorities. For instance, researchers analyzing circuits in North Carolina found that pruning the same section of line every three years versus four would reduce vegetation-related outages per month by 13 percent. A UVM team needs to go on the offensive by creating a strategy to secure funding and prove its worth. Armed with research, UVM program managers can show executives how, for example, putting crews into the field more frequently reaps benefits. UVM managers must have an exceptional understanding of outage history, whether that is outage frequency (SAIFI) or duration (SAIDI, CAIDI).

“Tree management decisions don’t typically manifest in reliability for three to five years,” adds Fallon. “Vegetation management helps with SAIFI, so that’s a key metric.”

Data of this kind is a foundation for the ROI of UVM. A UVM manager can tally up the cost per outage related to vegetation, especially outages outside normal business. They can then compare that to the price of proactively cutting a tree that LiDAR and JSM have identified as an imminent outage risk. With this data, managers can show the cost of delaying vegetation management.

Building a Case

The funding argument, in part, hinges on how much a utility avoids in costs by cutting a tree in 2025 and eliminating outages that tree likely will cause in 2025. While preventative maintenance has a cost, there is a countervailing cost avoidance. Putting a value on that offset is the UVM manager’s challenge.

A University of Connecticut study comparing 13 years of pruning using an enhanced tree pruning program versus nearby untreated rights-of-way found “treated conductors had storm outage rates that were 35 to 180 percent lower than the service-area’s average annual outage rate for untreated conductors.” While managers may question spending $5,000 to remove a pine tree that hasn’t fallen on a conductor, a UVM manager can present a business case for preventing the damage versus spending after the pine does fall. First, there could be an outage that lasts, say, 36 hours if the tree falls on a weekend night. There’s the cost of bringing crews in after-hours and, potentially, as much as $5,000 per day for traffic control. In some states like New Jersey, a police officer would be required, adding more expense.

Storm season can be a time for UVM managers to make a case for a systemic, technology-enabled strategy versus “hotspotting,” or targeted vegetation inspections and pruning of high-risk locations. With a systemwide strategy and oversight, crews can reduce the time they are called out for emergencies due to trees and limbs contacting feeders. For example, before switching to a systemwide vegetation management strategy, Minnesota’s Lake Region Electric Cooperative spent three times as much on hotspotting work. By switching to a systemwide UVM approach, the co-op’s cost-per-mile spending dropped from about $2,400 per mile to $500 per mile six years later.

Being Opportunistic

Selling the value of UVM requires vegetation management professionals who break down silos. They must cultivate good relationships across their organization. They must regularly meet with project managers to anticipate (and recommend) where UVM can play a strategic role. The alternative: Wait for a call to step into the middle of a project on an emergent, tactical issue.

For a utility to deploy a new UVM strategy, managers must take a preventative approach informed by oversight and regular reports documenting and photographing imminent threats. Technology can help inform a UVM strategy, but crews go into the field to do the work. And crews require JSM.

Running an exceptional UVM program requires managers (and JSMs) who look for the next opportunity. When utilities have routine in-person or virtual meetings to discuss projects, UVM managers need to be there. When meeting participants and project managers mention key phrases (e.g., new construction, reconductoring, expansion, or acquiring new land), a UVM manager or JSM should speak up and explain the vegetation management component.

“A vegetation manager needs to speak convincingly about the financial aspects of UVM,” reminds Fallon. “Utility leaders need to hear what they’re buying with vegetation management, whether that’s wildfire risk reduction or something else, and how vegetation management changes the utility’s risk profile.”

Spain, along with the rest of the world, has set self-imposed goals to achieve decarbonization. Solar power has emerged as the most practical and viable energy resource as the world transitions away from fossil fuels towards the renewable energy sector. What has emerged is a worrying trend that affects not only Spain but the rest of the world’s energy sectors as well.

The global approach to the energy transition has resulted in oversupply issues in the solar sector

Over the past few decades, the overarching consensus in the global energy market has been that the world needs to foster a more cooperative transition process that moves the world away from fossil fuels towards the renewable energy sector.

As the globe embraced the need to transition the energy sector, which has been echoed by the world leaders at a variety of events in the energy sector, the inevitable effect has been that the renewable energy sector would struggle to meet demand. In a proactive measure, the world’s solar manufacturers began to scale up production in preparation for an increase in demand.

It has now emerged that solar supply has overtaken global demand in the sector

The global solar sector has, for the past decade or so, been preparing for a significant increase in demand as the world transitions towards the renewable energy sector to accelerate decarbonization.

Those accelerated decarbonization goals have resulted in several nations assessing their needs and placing an increased importance on the solar sector. However, it now appears that the initial expectations exceeded actual demand as supply is exceeding demand in the solar sector. The result is that the number of hours in which solar power prices were zero or negative has increased, leading to market instability.

Spanish solar watchdog UNEF has reported an increase in negative or zero electricity prices

As Spain aims to align with the global narrative that calls for higher importance placed on decarbonization of the energy sector, the nation’s solar watchdog, UNEF, has reported that during the first eight months of 2025, solar energy producers experienced 693 hours with negative or zero electricity prices.

UNEF stakeholders have urged the Spanish solar sector to foster a reformative process that could positively affect the negative and zero prices that have emerged in the market due to supply exceeding demand.

“This issue and low and instabile capture prices show the urgent need for reforms to electricity prices.” – UNEF’s Jose Donoso

Spain echoed the consensus that exists in the global energy sector, which calls for an accelerated transition in the market. Spain set itself ambitious goals in its Climate and Energy Plan, and the evident zero and negative numbers in the solar sector have undermined Spain’s efforts to reach the self-imposed goals.

The nations of the world are breaking ground on massive solar projects that underline the oversupply issues existing in the sector at the moment.

The decision marks the 17th nationally-significant clean energy project approved by the government since July 2024 – enough clean energy to power the equivalent of more than 7.5 million homes – getting Britain building and boosting energy security.

Solar is the cheapest form of power available for the country. The government’s approach is to maximise solar on rooftops, which families could save around £500 a year on their energy bills by installing solar panels.

The government is also consulting on mandatory community benefits for communities hosting ground-mount solar, meaning families who live near a solar farm would directly benefit through funding that can be spent on local priorities, like new education schemes, new grassroots football pitches or better transport links. Developers for the Tillbridge project have committed to ensuring the local community benefits from the project.

Businesses and families are still feeling the impact of the country’s reliance on volatile global gas markets, which helped cause the biggest cost-of-living crisis in memory, with the price of gas still 75% higher that it was before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The only way to protect bill-payers from future price shocks is to drive forward with clean, homegrown power that Britain controls.

Energy Minister Michael Shanks said: “Families across Lincolnshire and the rest of the country have seen their energy bills go through the roof as a result of our exposure to volatile gas prices.

If we take a look at demography and debt, and political problems. Yes, you can do that. But if you want to focus only on the problems of America, you could also paint a similarly negative picture about the robustness of our political institutions or the robustness of our economy right now, as well.

Jason Bordoff: Trade tensions between the US and China have hit a new high mark. After China announced plans to ratchet up its export controls of some rare-earths and magnets with strategic uses, President Trump threatened to retaliate with 100% tariffs, which would go into effect on November 1 or possibly sooner. But the competition between these two world powers goes far beyond trade disputes and tariffs. It’s a contest between fundamentally different approaches to governance, technology, and economic development.

China, of course, dominates critical supply chains for clean energy technologies. But many of the innovations that spawned those technologies were born here in the US. China builds, and governs through strong state control. The US innovates, but struggles to build.

How did these two nations develop such different capabilities? What does China’s dominance in manufacturing mean for American competitiveness and national security? And can the United States learn from China’s approach to building at scale without sacrificing democratic values and individual rights?

This is Columbia Energy Exchange, a weekly podcast from the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University. I’m Jason Bordoff.

Today on the show — Dan Wang.

Dan is a research fellow at Stanford University’s Hoover History Lab and studies China’s technological capabilities. He is the author of Breakneck: China’s Quest to Engineer the Future, a New York Times bestseller. Dan was previously a fellow at the Yale Law School’s Paul Tsai China Center and a lecturer at Yale University’s MacMillan Center for International and Area Studies.

Dan and I discussed his book, which casts China as an engineering state and America as a lawyerly society. We talked about how those orientations manifest in everything from public transit to advanced manufacturing to the rise of artificial intelligence. We explored immigration policy, talent retention, and whether the U.S.-China relationship is headed toward further escalation or a different future. And Dan explained why he thinks that despite these deep divisions between our governments, American and Chinese people are similar in profound ways.

I hope you enjoy our conversation.

Dan Wang, thanks so much for making time to be with us. Welcome to Columbia Energy Exchange and congratulations on the great book Breakneck. It’s getting tremendous reviews, nominations in the Financial Times and other places and congrats on all the success.

Dan Wang: Thanks Jason. It’s my pleasure to be here.

Jason Bordoff: So there’s so much to talk about. I feel like I have to start with a mea culpa because I have a law degree, so I feel like I’m part of the problem.

Dan Wang: Sorry, next podcast please.

Jason Bordoff: So for those listening who may not know why I just said that or have read the book yet, just sort of explain the frame you’re bringing to help think about the US-China relationship tensions right now and why lawyers are the problem.

Dan Wang: Yes, so I spent 2017 to 2023 living in China, working as a technology analyst at a global macro research firm, and it felt like a pretty momentous time to be in China when Donald Trump had just launched his first trade war. China was growing in technological capabilities and the centerpiece of my time was living through the entirety of Zero-COVID. I started feeling frustrated that we’re reasoning through the US and China with these 19th century political science terms like socialist and capitalist and neoliberal, whatever that means. I just wanted to have a new and inventive fun framing of the US and China. So China’s a country I call the engineering state because at various points in the recent past, all of its most senior leadership have had degrees in engineering of a very Soviet sort. They were trained in hydraulic engineering, electrical engineering, civil engineering, et cetera.

They build their way out of every problem. So China builds a ton of high-speed rail, bridges, roads, highways, homes, hyperscalers, solar, wind, nuclear, whatever. They treat the economy sometimes as an engineering exercise, pushing smart people away out of cryptocurrencies and consumer tech into semiconductors and aviation and clean tech. They also engineer the people. So I write extensively about the one-child policy as well as Zero-COVID in which the number is right there in the name. They get really literal-minded about treating society as just another building material to be torn down and remolded as they wish. I contrast that with the United States, which I call the lawyerly society because it seems like everyone who goes on to be president first has to go through the Yale Law School.

Jason Bordoff: You said five out of the last 10 presidents have attended law school and some huge number of the Politburo Standing Committee by contrast were trained as engineers, if I recall correctly.

Dan Wang: At one point all of them, all nine members of the Politburo Standing Committee were engineers. Of the earlier American presidents, first 16 US presidents from George Washington to Abraham Lincoln, 13 of them were lawyers. Within the Democratic party, it’s especially lawyerly. Every single presidential nominee to be president from the Democrats between 1980 to 2024 had a law degree. The issue with lawyers is that they block everything good and bad, so you don’t have stupid ideas like the one-child policy. You also don’t have functional infrastructure, I would say, almost anywhere in the United States.

Jason Bordoff: I’m going to come to all of that, but just remind people again who may not know you or your background. You were born in China, you’ve lived in Canada and the US, so just remind people about your journey and how you came to this work and the perspective it gives you on both of these societies.

Dan Wang: I am from southwest China, a province called Yunnan, which is pretty distant, far away from the more prosperous coasts. When I was seven years old, my parents and I immigrated to Canada. I grew up mostly in Ottawa and my parents and I moved to the US when I was in high school. We moved to Bucks County, Pennsylvania, so this is suburban Philly. I feel like I’ve spent about equal parts of my life between the US, China and Canada at this point. I used to work in Silicon Valley and part of the reason that I moved out of Silicon Valley was that I thought that too much of tech in California was focused on small problems like consumer tech and cryptocurrencies. The Chinese, when I moved there at the start of 2017, had just announced that they were working on things like Made in China 2025 segments. They really wanted to get great at solar, batteries, nuclear power plants and what the Chinese were up to just seemed to be on a much larger scale.

Jason Bordoff: Sort of, I guess you’re echoing what Peter Thiel’s quote, we wanted flying cars and we got 140 characters. Is that sort of the narrowness?

Dan Wang: That is one element of it. Yeah.

Jason Bordoff: Actually one of, I do a lot of cycling and I love that five-day bike trip you did through China. So that sounded like a great trip, but also a really interesting way to see the extent to which building in that country is happening, including in so many parts of the country that lots of people who travel there maybe less than before Beijing, Shanghai, but it’s much broader than I think people here appreciate about the scale of the building and the modernization.

Dan Wang: Yeah, I spent five days cycling through a province called Guizhou, which is also in China’s southwest, also very mountainous and far away from the prosperous coasts. Guizhou is China’s fourth poorest province. It has 15 airports, it has 45 of the world’s tallest bridges—the world’s tallest bridges, not China’s tallest bridges—and it has high-speed rail. As I was cycling through, I was thinking that, oh my gosh, China’s fourth poorest province has much better levels of infrastructure than California where I’m speaking to you now as well as New York state. These places don’t really have high-speed rail. These places don’t really have excellent airports. So there is something pretty remarkable that the Chinese have been able to build a lot of excellent infrastructure. This I think has also been a way to build political resilience into the Communist party because if you’re a resident of Shanghai or Guizhou, every year you’re getting more subway stations, you’re getting more parks, you’re getting better integrated into the high-speed rail network where you can take the train from Shanghai to Guizhou as I did. As physical dynamism has produced a better life around you, you also feel like the future will be better than today. Whereas if you’re living in a pretty static place, like many parts of the US—I guess San Francisco and New York have built a little bit over the past decades, but if your only exposure to a better life is a new coffee shop around the corner, I think that you don’t expect the future to be very substantially better than the past.

Jason Bordoff: You have that great sort of stat data point at the beginning framing this about the year 2008 when California voters approved a high-speed rail between San Francisco and LA and China began construction of the Beijing-Shanghai high-speed rail line. Three years later that was done in China at a cost of $36 billion. I guess the latest estimate for a small segment of the line between San Francisco and Los Angeles is 2030 to 33, which I’m quoting your book, which means the margin of error for estimating when a partial leg of California’s high-speed rail will open is the same as the time it took China to build the entire Beijing-Shanghai line. I thought that captured, well I guess this broadly, not just your book, but the Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson’s Abundance book and this whole idea that it has become too difficult to build is all sort of captured in that. So what lessons do you take from that other than lawyers are the problem? Where does that take us in terms of the kind of reforms, the policy approaches that we need in the US?

Dan Wang: Yeah, I think that lawyers are partially the problem. They’re partially the solution. I think that first let me defend a little bit of the lawyerly society, which is that I think that lawyers are guarantors of some degree of pluralism and they are guarantors of rights in many cases. Let me be very clear, I think that the US should not become like China in order to build a lot of infrastructure. There are much better models to reach for. Countries like Spain and France and Denmark and Japan have built excellent infrastructure without trampling over the rights of people at about one-tenth of the cost of New York City’s Second Avenue subway or something. But I think the problem with a lot of lawyerly society is that I think lawyers fundamentally are servants of the rich. Now, there are many types of lawyers and there are many types of lawyers that defend rights, but among the most lucrative parts of the law are rich people suing each other or suing the government.

I think one big problem with, let’s say California, is that speaking to you from San Francisco, this area is the only part of the world that managed to create several companies worth over trillions of dollars and especially Apple and Nvidia are super profitable, gigantic companies today. You can’t create companies worth trillions of dollars without some degree of legal protection. America is a country that works really well for the rich. They feel comfortable about starting their businesses here. I think this is both a benefit and a problem. I think that the rich in America have a lot of power. There’s nowhere better in the world to be rich. You can pretty easily transmute some of your wealth into political influence if you’re rich in America. I think the problem with America is that it can’t work in the longer run if it benefits especially the rich.

If you’re a rich person in New York City, you don’t worry about high housing costs. You have these skinny skyscrapers overlooking Central Park that you’re able to buy apartment units in. You don’t take the subway to work, you don’t have to deal with a screeching loud metallic scream every time the subway rolls in. What I would really like is for the US to build a little bit more for the people—people who need more affordable homes, people who need functioning mass transit in order to get to work. That is a little bit more of what I want the US to be able to do.

Jason Bordoff: And if you’re avoiding mass transit because of the screeching, you’re probably in a vehicle that’s going to take twice as long to get where you’re going. So it’s kind of important for densely packed cities like New York to have that. Regardless, I will say for people who want to hear your thoughts a little more deeply on tech and Silicon Valley and what that US-China relationship means, I listened to a great conversation you did with my friend DJ Patil at the Commonwealth Club, which I would encourage people to listen to. I thought that was really good.

I want to come back to your point about political resilience as one of the things that emerges from this. Is there a limit to that? I mean the argument that we’ve seen some make, and you can tell me whether you buy into it or not, Hal Brands and people about peak China—when part of the way you’re maintaining political and public support is by this continued investment in building like housing. Is there kind of a limit to that if the economy can’t catch up? And for all the constraints of lawyers versus engineers, US economy has generally performed pretty well compared to China. So in the long term, do you get political resilience from this approach?

Dan Wang: There are always a lot of risks now. I think that one way to understand the Chinese experience is to deliver things that people want. So I mean it’s always impossible to interpret the public interest, but according to the public interest that’s interpreted by the Communist party, people want cleaner air and better parks and monumental projects. That might be right or wrong, but I do feel like plenty of people in Guizhou point to these bridges with pride. Plenty of residents of Shanghai really love it when they have new and better subway lines. Of course there are limits to China’s approach. China’s economy right now is not on very strong footing and that’s in part because of the government’s actions to channel so much investment into manufacturing rather than give people more disposable income through some degree of redistribution. I think that China’s youth unemployment is really high, long-term simmering demographic decline that China will have to deal with.

I think the most striking fact to me is that plenty of people want to depart from China. According to some statistics, something like 14,000 millionaires departed from China in the year 2023. They take themselves and their wealth out to Japan, Singapore, London, New York, whatever it is. There’s a lot of creative types who feel like journalists, filmmakers, artists who feel that the government is growing more censorious as it is, and they decide that they want to be in places like New York or Amsterdam or northern Thailand where they can be a little bit more free in pursuing artistic pursuits. Then there’s a class of people who are not necessarily rich, not necessarily very creative types who have decided to fly to Ecuador where they don’t need a visa and then walk across the southwestern American border with other Central American migrants. The US CBP is apprehending something like 40,000 Chinese nationals across the southern border in the year 2024 every single month. There’s plenty of people who don’t like the engineering. They don’t feel like they want to be socially engineered. Xi Jinping has echoed a line from Joseph Stalin that the communist party and the teachers may need to be engineers of the soul. I don’t know about you Jason, but I don’t like having my own soul engineered.

Jason Bordoff: That point you made about people wanting to depart for reasons of creativity, open society, economic opportunity—is that changing? Particularly I’m thinking with regard to the US given the posture we’ve seen, particularly this administration take, but the general hostility in the US-China relationship. We’ve had so many Chinese students who’ve come to American universities for so long and often stayed to start companies or contribute to companies. Is that changing? Is the US shooting itself in the foot in that way do you think?

Dan Wang: Yes, I think that it is definitely a question that many Chinese have about whether they want to stay in the US longer term. I think there are still plenty of Chinese who would move to the US given the chance, but if we take a look at some well-educated Chinese especially, I spend some time thinking about AI researchers in Silicon Valley. According to some of these publicly disclosed top AI researchers, many of them attended Chinese universities, many of them are Chinese nationals. Many of these people are questioning whether they want to stay in the US longer term. It could be as simple as the fact that San Francisco is not always a wonderful city and they don’t like walking amidst so many syringes in the streets. It could be that they’re really put off by Donald Trump’s rhetoric about how he feels about Chinese.

It could be that they just miss great noodles and they miss mom’s cooking. But this is kind of a fluid group of people and I’m sure a bunch of Chinese students who are struggling with staying in Trump’s America in part because they don’t like the politics, in part because the visa policies are shifting against them. Though they would love to stay, they cannot have any means to stay. I’m still really struck by this episode last month in which ICE conducted this raid on South Korean engineers trying to build a battery facility in the state of Georgia and deporting them and humiliating them in chains. I think that’s not the right approach for trying to build America into a clean tech superpower. China’s approach was to have a bunch of engineers from Apple and Tesla, welcome them with open arms, treat them really well so that they could teach Chinese to make some of the most sophisticated consumer electronics products in the case of Apple and most sophisticated EVs in the case of Tesla and to impart their managerial expertise and technical expertise into the minds and hands of Chinese workers. I’m wondering if this worked for China, why can’t it work for the US?

Jason Bordoff: I think there’s a perception from at least some in the US that China’s manufacturing prowess is in making cheap iPhones, it’s manufacturing at scale and lowering costs, maybe stealing IP, but it is real innovation too in the end. The companies that emerge like BYD or something, there’s extraordinary innovation happening there and I’m wondering if you feel like that is true and maybe not well appreciated enough?

Dan Wang: Yes, definitely. I think that there is this California mode of innovation in which you get a Steve Jobs, make him take a bunch of LSD, he goes into a garage and then a Mac computer rolls out. I think that is kind of a strange model of innovation and I think that the Chinese approach is much less LSD driven for sure. It is less of these light bulb moments and it is kind of just this incremental working on products in which progress is accretive and by the end of it, a much better product does come out. I think the challenge and the provocation I would offer to Americans is what has greater glory—is it to invent the solar cell as Bell Labs did in the year 1954? And in that case you get into the history books forever. Or is it to actually own this industry as China does?

Because China makes about 90% of solar photovoltaic panels, everything from the polysilicon processing all the way down to the assembly of the actual modules. I submit it is much better to own an industry rather than to invent it because otherwise I don’t think we’re giving that much credit to the British and the Germans anymore for inventing everything. It is much better to own these industries and America is really good at building a couple of ladders like reaching the top of the solar ladder, but it is not very good at actually climbing these sort of ladders because its firms are not very good at manufacturing anything anymore. I encourage Americans to treat manufacturing with greater seriousness and to figure out how to own these products that American scientists invent.

Jason Bordoff: So I want to ask you why that is and then also ask you why that matters—why it matters where we manufacture lots of things. But in terms of why that is, you said you don’t want to become like China. You mentioned the rights of people, maybe one-child policy, the way the state has orchestrated people’s lives, but in terms of becoming like China in the sense of engineering society, being able to manufacture at scale what you just said a moment ago, I presume you do want more of that. The question is what lessons you think we should learn from China? The idea of abundance has captured a lot of attention, but the question of how you do it—I mean environmental protections exist for a reason. There was a great builder here in New York, Robert Moses, who built lots of built New York for cars and put an expressway through the Bronx and almost through Washington Square Park. So environmental protections, community engagement, the things lawyers do serve a purpose, but if we’ve gone too far, what lessons can we learn about the right way to address that and fix that? Maybe we don’t go too far in the other direction.

Dan Wang: Yeah. Well let’s talk about China and I also have some thoughts about Robert Moses that I want to toss at you first. I think that there’s something that the Chinese deeply appreciate with technology production that the Americans have mostly forgotten. I think when I think about technology production, I think that it is made up of three different things. First, technology is made up of tooling and equipment. So these are pots, pans and a stove in a kitchen analogy. The second part of technology is written instruction. So patents, blueprints, something like a recipe. Third and most important, technology is process knowledge and process knowledge is what exists in people’s heads that’s impossible to write down. It’s what exists in people’s hands. You can also call it tacit knowledge, industrial expertise. It mostly lives on in communities of engineering practice. I think the United States was relatively relaxed about having Walmart ship a lot of goods into China throughout the 1990s.

There were some people who dissented against that, but broadly speaking, the elites gave the green light for American corporates to ship jobs to China. The US manufacturing population has declined, not mostly because of China. The economists tell us it is mostly because of technological automation, but a portion of that—American managerial expertise—really did move to China. I think the Chinese live and breathe technology production. They’re very intent on making really good products and they have a sense of how important it is to just keep knowledge alive and to keep it going. Technology is something that they practice and such that if you are just making a lot of great products, you don’t necessarily think too much about what’s going on in the mind of Xi Jinping. You don’t necessarily think about what’s going on in the mind of Donald Trump. You’re just solving three new problems a day before breakfast. Once you’re confronted with these challenges, you can move on to solve bigger and better challenges. This is a lot of the reason I think that the US no longer has the ability even to be very aware of what is important and valuable about new manufacturing processes. Now as promised, let me make a quick point about Robert Moses or do you want to say something?

Jason Bordoff: Well, I was just going to ask you about that. It sounds like if I’m hearing you right, the original sin in some sense was the embrace of globalization that things like tariffs or Buy America provisions to try to keep manufacturing at home, force people to do it here. Actually that’s part of the prescription you’re describing. Is that wrong?

Dan Wang: I think that there are several sins. There was no single original sin, but one part was a relatively relaxed attitude about moving offshore. I think that was downstream of this decision by a lot of investors to focus really only on the most profitable bits of technology production. So I mean Apple really is amazing at software and marketing and it has a lot of hardware experience, but a lot of that hardware experience is also shared. It’s mostly based in China. So I think that there is kind of also this sense that in China it is good to build manufacturing redundancies. In America the saying from someone like Tim Cook is inventory is evil. What we need is just-in-time production. So everything feels actually much more brittle and poised for perfection. What the Chinese have done is build much greater redundancies into the system. I think what we want is a little bit more focus on resilience rather than profitability.

Jason Bordoff: Okay. Robert Moses and then I’ll come back to what we were just talking about.

Dan Wang: Yeah, I think that first of all, The Power Broker is just one of the most amazing monumental books ever produced. I think it is an amazing work of biography. I read it last year along with a lot of other people in the 50th anniversary of the book, but I think it is also one of these books that produced the turn towards the lawyerly society in America, along with Jane Jacobs, along with Rachel Carson, along with Ralph Nader’s activism. I think it was definitely wrong for Robert Moses to ram so many highways into New York City in the Bronx and Sunset Park, and I think he certainly needed to have been stopped at the time that he was stopped. But I frankly don’t quite understand why it is that we in 2024, 2025 are still reading this book and feeling like it is still holding some of the answers of New York City development because the problem with the book is embedded in the subtitle: Robert Moses and the Fall of New York. Has New York fallen to me?

Well, the real estate prices haven’t fallen. It’s an extraordinarily expensive place to be. I spend a lot of time in Michigan. My wife is a professor at the University of Michigan, and if you want to take a look at fallen cities, come with me to the industrial Midwest. Places like Detroit and Pittsburgh and Cleveland. Pittsburgh has actually done better, but Cleveland and Detroit have obviously fallen much more. I think there are parts of Robert Moses’ agenda that I think have made New York into the gleaming city as it is today. He reorganized the southern part of Washington Square Park and gave that to NYU. NYU used to be closer to where you are in the part of town closer to Columbia. I think NYU wouldn’t be the university it is if it weren’t a little bit more central in Manhattan. Robert Moses built the Lincoln Center and what could be more elite than the opera and the ballet, but I think that New York City is a gleaming cultural center in part because it has that. So I think that we need a little bit of revisionism on Moses—recognize his mistakes but also recognize that he has done a lot of amazing things also for New York City.

Jason Bordoff: Yeah, for sure. He was a master builder and a lot of the building was important and gave us the city we have today. We’re also living with the legacy of some things. Maybe in retrospect it would’ve been done differently, but the names you mentioned sort of highlight that tension. Right? Rachel Carson who famously wrote Silent Spring about DDT—through the forties and fifties and sixties was another great book by Douglas Brinkley, the American historian about the history of the American environmental movement where we partly in the spirit of building rapidly did spoil a lot of the air and water across the country and that led to landmark laws to be put in place to prevent that which are important. Also in my view and probably yours, have also been weaponized and gone too far and prevent sensible things from happening today. The challenge we have is sort of how to find the balance between those two things and get that right.

Can I ask about, you brought up energy, so let me sort of come to that a little bit in terms of the manufacturing capacity that China has, say, in solar PV and the dominant position that it has there. That’s true in batteries and electric vehicles, critical minerals refining and processing. We’re talking on the day that, and this will come out a couple of days after we talk, but President Trump threatened massive tariffs in response to China imposing restrictions on rare earths and magnet exports, highlighting a concern that many people have about the dominant position they have in these clean energy supply chains. On the other hand, if you think about something like a solar panel, climate is in my view, probably yours too, a very important challenge. We need to be moving much, much faster to deploy clean energy. If you want to move faster to deploy clean energy, you want it to be really cheap.

To the extent people feel like manufacturing needs to happen at home, buying things from China is a problem. The phrase national security is a label that gets thrown on everything now. All of that is difficult and inflationary and throwing up barriers to try to onshore or friendshore just makes things, I think more costly, causes delay. It takes a long time to build up the kind of supply chains China has. So I’m wondering how you think about the reason we’re doing this. You said a moment ago, we should have more manufacturing in the US. Is that because those are jobs that are good jobs and union jobs? Is that because as Jake Sullivan said, there’s a small yard of sensitive national security things that we want to make sure we have domestic capacity for military or other applications? Why do we care where all of this stuff is made and is it a problem to buy a lot of what we need in clean energy or otherwise from China?

Dan Wang: I think my view first and foremost of technology is that technology is like a ladder and if you miss a couple of rungs early on in the ladder, it becomes really difficult to climb up. This is a lot of what I mean by process knowledge. You have a lot of process knowledge in, say, workers who are making iPhones one year, they make a Huawei phone the next year, then they go make a DJI drone and an electric vehicle battery next. So they’re able to do these sort of things and move up the ladder. If you’re not on the ladder, then you can’t win these sort of industries. I think there is a national security argument in which, I mean just in terms of really direct national security goods like munitions now—what’s more national security than these sort of military goods? The US shipped a lot of munitions to Ukraine in self-defense against Russia.

I think that’s good, but then the US wasn’t able to build its stockpile very easily. So this is a way in which the defense industrial base is rusted and they need to get a lot better. I think there is also an economic resilience argument here where in the early days of the pandemic, the US wasn’t able to make relatively simple products like masks and cotton swabs. I think the US ought to be able to respond in any sort of an emergency. For me it is less important to create high-paying union jobs because I’m a little bit traumatized by some of these press releases from California high-speed rail. When the Chinese talk about high-speed rail, they talk about the number of people it’s moved. So in the first decade after the completion of China’s first high-speed rail line, Beijing-Shanghai, according to state media, China had completed about 1.4 billion passenger trips over the first decade.

When I see press releases from California high-speed rail, they’re always touting about the number of high-paying union jobs that this is supporting. I’m thinking the voters approved this referendum in the year 2008 to connect San Francisco and Los Angeles through high-speed rail. Will anyone be able to take this train from SF to LA 30 years after its completion? I’m not sure if we’re on track. So I think this is where I want the Americans to be a little bit more outcome oriented and not be so concerned about process and procedure. We actually need to do the things that the government says that it’s going to do.

Jason Bordoff: And give us a sense of how possible this is given that we missed some rungs in the ladder. When you think about something, again, the news of today, the position that China has in refining and processing the world’s critical minerals or making batteries or pick your thing, I do have a sense in which we have some government subsidies, some restrictions maybe on imports in the Inflation Reduction Act or other pieces of legislation. Then you see an announcement of a project here or there and people think, look, we can do it. We can manufacture these things at home. But the scale and magnitude of the dominant position China has really created is almost like staggering to comprehend and how long it would take and how difficult it would be to replicate that to meaningfully put a dent. People talk about diversification, want to diversify supply chains, but to bring in your areas of clean energy where the dominant position is 70, 80, 90% of manufacturing in many of the things I just talked about—to change that meaningfully, is that possible or is that like a scale of challenge at this point that is almost too difficult to tackle and then we need to think maybe about other policy tools to build resilience?

You could have strategic stockpiles, we can go down the list of other things one can do besides try to make things at home instead of importing them, but give us some sense of the scale of what it means for China to be dominant in these industries and how hard it is to replicate that.

Dan Wang: I am a sunny optimist from California, but I am not especially optimistic in this case. As a technology analyst in China, I was covering China’s capabilities in semiconductors as well as clean tech. Just thinking about the degree of China’s solar advantage, about 90% of the solar supply chain is Chinese. In part that is because processing polysilicon as well as other critical minerals is so energy intensive and polluting that only the Chinese have the stomach to do these sort of things. Cancer rates for some of these critical mineral refineries are just off the charts in the towns where these things are based. China is making frankly better electric vehicles at a cheaper cost than the Americans and Germans and the Japanese are able to do. They are deploying—according to, I just saw this on Ember Research—I think that China’s on track to deploy about 500 gigawatts of solar this year, and the US is on track to produce 50. So just one order of magnitude difference, and they just seem to be much, much more serious about solving a lot of their energy needs. What’s striking is that by the end of this year, one in two cars sold in China will be electric. I’m not sure what the ratio is in the US. Do you know—is it over 10%?

Jason Bordoff: Just over 10%.

Dan Wang: Okay. So the Americans is about one in 10, the Chinese is one in two. I think the technocratic seriousness comes in which they know that they need to import a lot of Middle East oil and gas to power their gasoline vehicles. But if they’re electric then they could be powered by domestic coal, domestic wind and domestic solar and domestic nuclear. So they have a much more serious sense of energy sovereignty than the Americans. What have the Americans been up to? Well, Donald Trump calls wind and solar the scam of the century. Maybe they’ll do more nuclear. Maybe the Trump administration will do more nuclear, but I’m not sure if it is actually on track to do so. With the Biden administration, it was also really slow and plodding and lawyerly, and this felt like industrial policy as conducted by Yale Law School where they were not actually fundamentally interested in the outcome. It was so procedural and they simply did not build enough even after passage of the Inflation Reduction Act. Right after they lost the election, Donald Trump is now in office threatening to cancel a lot of these different projects. I think this is where I would challenge parts of the left to question, is this about union jobs or is this about deployment of clean tech? What I think we should do is to focus a little bit more on the outcomes here rather than the process of trying to build.

Jason Bordoff: And tell me again in terms of the dominant position in manufacturing for maybe not the most advanced semiconductors with sensitive military applications, but technology broadly like solar panels or something, maybe batteries again, why we care. In that sense, how you think about the way China thinks about its dominant position and what it is using that for. We saw, as I mentioned a moment ago, restrictions announced this week on rare earth and magnet exports. Is the view here on both sides of the aisle that the US-China relationship is in a state now where there is a significant risk to this dependence because China will weaponize it? Do you think that is a view shared in China? Is that the intent of building this dominance—to weaponize it?

Dan Wang: Let me tell you that this is not a view that’s shared in China. This is a certainty in China because they can very well say that the United States was way earlier in weaponizing its economy against China. We don’t need to get into finger pointing about who’s to blame. That’s not a very interesting exercise. But I did live through the first trade war Donald Trump launched in China, which quickly morphed into the technology war in which the US government started adding all of these Chinese companies onto obscure blacklists in which Chinese companies, most notably Huawei, found that they could no longer procure American semiconductors. For several of these companies, their entire supply chain collapsed because some office in the Department of Commerce says no more American semiconductors for you. So I would say that the Americans have been showing the Chinese their weak spots and their vulnerabilities over much of the past decade to the considerable pain and suffering and distress of a lot of Chinese companies.

China is really paying back the US only at the start of this year when they started controlling the exports of rare earth magnets, which devastated a lot of automakers and a lot of clean tech producers. So I think that is certainly one reason to care. Another reason to care is that you shouldn’t give up on technologies of the future, that you should keep continuing to climb various technological ladders. Yet another reason to care is that I think that there is an important resilience argument here as well, that you should be able to train your workforce to be able to respond in an emergency if an emergency comes.

Jason Bordoff: You probably saw President Trump’s response to the China announcement earlier today in which he said, well, for every restriction they can put in place, we can do two, I’m paraphrasing—or the US has a far stronger monopoly, we have more weapons to use against them than they have against us. That was basically the point of his message. Is that true? Where does the US have a pretty weak hand to play here in terms of trying to think about the threats posed by the dominant position China has on a lot of these critical technologies?

Dan Wang: I think it is probably true, but I say let’s not find out. I think that when you bring up this analogy of hand, one of the earlier remarks from Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent in the early days of the trade war was that America has a super strong hand. They’re playing with a pair of twos and we’re playing with a pair of aces. This was based on this theory that ultimately what matters is the market. If the Americans don’t buy from you, then your economy collapses. I think the Chinese and I believe in an alternate theory, which is that it is actually the goods manufacturers which have the much greater advantage here. If your critical goods suppliers do not wish to sell to you, then your economy might have pretty substantial problems as well. What was really striking to me was that China does have a lot of these chokeholds over the US and they were relatively restrained early on in the trade war.

They only stopped the export of rare earth magnets. They could have done a lot more. They could have stopped the export of a lot of electronics products. A lot of pharmaceuticals are almost entirely Chinese, I believe—fermented antibiotics as well as ibuprofen. So they only squeezed one finger and they could have squeezed much harder. Now obviously the US could squeeze harder itself, could block more semiconductors from going to China. It could block more aviation jets from going to China. It could heavily sanction China through the Department of the Treasury. But I feel like we should not get into this escalatory spiral in which these two countries attempt to destroy each other’s economies. I think that would be disastrous for everyone because then we can start contemplating about the possibility of hot war and we really shouldn’t get anywhere close to that.

Jason Bordoff: Yeah, the risk of escalation, the tension in the relationship now, it seems to be growing. I’m wondering if that’s where you think things are headed now. I thought it was for all of that conversation we just had and all the difficulty and dangers in the US-China relationship, I was struck that you started off the book by saying, I am sure that no two peoples are more alike than Americans and Chinese. What did you mean by that and what does that portend for a different sort of future?

Dan Wang: Yeah. Well, myself, I am a cool, calm, collected Canadian going through these two big countries. They feel maddening and thrilling and fundamentally bizarre. I feel like a lot of Europeans and a lot of Japanese are quite alike. There’s a sense of coziness, there’s a lot of perfectionism. Their cities are much more beautiful than I think American and Chinese cities. But Chinese and Americans have a sense of hustle. They appreciate the technological sublime. They really want to become great powers and they want other countries to listen to them and they take shortcuts. I think what Chinese and Americans share is just that companies are really hungry. They want profit, they’re willing to make tradeoffs, and the American government and the Chinese government both also have a raw hunger for geopolitical power. They really, really want power in a way that I think you don’t really see this so much among the Europeans or again, the Japanese. So there’s much more that unites these two countries in terms of similarity, which is probably why they’re so directly competitive with each other.

Jason Bordoff: And I just want to come back to the question I asked you earlier about sort of where China is in its growth and its evolution now. Because again, there have been various articles written about so-called peak China—that China is nearing a point where it’s going to be difficult to sustain its economic growth and economic competitiveness. Is that where you think things are as there’s only so many cities of cement and steel, only so many bridges and buildings you can build? At a certain point once you’ve stimulated the economy with all of that engineering you talked about, is it nearing the apex of that and does that portend a slower outlook for the economy and maybe political challenges?

Dan Wang: No, I think that my view is that the US and China are going to be in competition for a long time, that we should understand them not through whatever structural advantages, because I think it is quite easy to paint an ugly picture of China. If we take a look at demography and debt and political problems, yes, you can do that, but if you wanted to focus only on the problems of America, you could also paint a similarly negative picture about the robustness of our political institutions or the robustness of our economy right now as well. My view of the competition is that I think that neither the US nor China are going to implode and then fail to get back up. I think that the more ahead that one country looks, the more the leader will make mistakes out of overconfidence and then overstep.

The more behind that the other country feels, they will work harder to reform themselves, to be more competitive. I think both countries have done superb jobs of hurting themselves and hobbling themselves. I think that is going to be a challenge with both of them. Now, I also want to be clear that I think that China will not replace the US as the global superpower, largely because the US is also a financial superpower, cultural superpower, diplomatic superpower. The engineering state will never, for example, become a financial superpower because they are insistent on capital controls. So you can’t be a global financial power if you insist on capital controls. But I think there is one area in which China is set to succeed because they’re engineers—they’re going to win on advanced manufacturing. I think that there will be a second China shock against American manufacturers.

Right now America has 12 million manufacturing workers. Could I see that dropping? Yeah, I can imagine a scenario in which that number of manufacturing workers halves over the next 10 years because of various problems. I think that even if the Chinese win on this fairly narrow victory of manufacturing, it could be the case that as the US loses more manufacturing workers, the economy and the industrial Midwest weakens, I think our politics will get worse. So this is kind of the big scenario that I’m worried about—worse economy, worse politics too because of manufacturing loss.

Jason Bordoff: You may not have sort of looked carefully at the energy outlook, but I’m wondering if what you just said sort of relates to it in the sense of how dramatic the growth in energy use and greenhouse gas emissions have been in coal use. One objection you often hear when people suggest the US should move faster to decarbonize is, but look at China, look at how much coal they use—half the world’s coal. But that outlook is changing. Coal use is maybe plateaued in China. It’s kind of flatlining. Renewables are still growing pretty strongly and I’m wondering if that’s partly about policy or climate or otherwise, but also just structural changes in the economy. As I said, very energy intensive or coal intensive, steel, cement, building and building all the bridges and buildings and cities—at a certain point that starts to plateau and change towards something like advanced manufacturing. Maybe that changes the energy mix as well.

Dan Wang: Yeah, I think it’s definitely both structural as well as political. Last I checked about 60% of China’s total energy use is still driven by coal. That is a really high share, but it is definitely the case that it seems like oil dependence has stopped growing. So both coal as well as oil has stopped growing at least. I think that’s in part because the Chinese are reacting—the Chinese government is reacting to people’s demands to have cleaner air. So that is definitely very positive. As I mentioned, the Chinese are reading all of these CSIS or American reports saying that, oh, China has all these vulnerabilities through the Straits of Hormuz or Straits of Malacca in which they can’t have oil. The Chinese say, oh, well maybe that’s right. Which is why now one in two cars sold in China is electric and so they want to be using domestic power. So part of this is a natural slowdown in the Chinese economy. Part of this is to respond to the citizens’ demands for cleaner air. I think part of it is a very real geopolitical, geostrategic element to say let’s have real energy sovereignty in which the Chinese seem much more all of the above on energy than frankly Donald Trump does. All of the above except for wind. That’s weird.

Jason Bordoff: He does not seem to be a fan of wind, although we do need a lot of power and it’s probably going to need to come from lots of sources, particularly. Well, it relates to what you said earlier actually. You mentioned AI and we haven’t talked too much about it, but the broad frame of competition to win an AI race, is that sort of the right way to think about it? Where is China in this race? How advanced is it, and how will sort of the coming age of AI affect some of the dynamics you just talked about in the US-China relationship?

Dan Wang: The US is still definitely in the lead on AI. They have compute capacity represented by advanced chips. They have the better reasoning models and they have a lot of amazing talent. But I say don’t count China out. I just wrote a piece that came out yesterday in the Financial Times outlining how China could win on AI. My case is that partly due to electrical power, China right now has twice the electrical capacity as the US and maybe that gap will grow even larger because they’re building so much more solar and nuclear, and the US is not. There’s a lot of Chinese students and Chinese researchers who are doubtful of staying in Trump’s America, especially if a trade war between these two countries escalates. I wonder what AI is going to be used for between both the US and China. The US is much more of a lawyerly society and maybe we’re going to use all the AI to produce even more lawsuits, and the Chinese is much more manufacturing driven and they’re going to use AI to produce more electronics, to produce more munitions and to produce more wind turbines as well.

Maybe just let me make one more note about wind and the lawyerly society. I think one of the more radicalizing stories I heard about wind was the story of Cape Wind. Now I’m thinking about wind because you have a scale model of a turbine behind you, but Cape Wind was made up of a bunch of wealthy landowners in Nantucket or Martha’s Vineyard hiring top lawyers, including a top Harvard law professor to say, we should not have wind because it will ruin the sight of our coastline and we need to save the whales too. This is one of the sins of the lawyerly society. Progressives are saying, not in my backyard, not in my coastline. They’re able to hire incredible lawyers to get what they want. So this is where I am doubtful that the lawyers have the right answer here.

Jason Bordoff: Yeah, I mean it is partly I think not in my backyard and sort of a knee-jerk reaction. There was a little panel at Aspen Ideas Festival this year on the book Abundance and Mark Dunkelman’s—I’m blank on the name of it, but in that vein, another great book.

Dan Wang: Why Nothing Works.

Jason Bordoff: Yes, correct. Also a great book. I thought it was a good comment when there was a lot of support in the crowd for this idea. The moderator, Fareed Zakaria sort of noted, everybody who’s working in the buildings at this conference needs to live an hour away because it’s pretty hard to build housing anywhere near the town of Aspen for reasons. So that’s sort of the point you’re making—that people like that idea in theory, but maybe not in their backyard. There’s another dimension to it, which is environmental groups have spent a very long time trying to protect fisheries, trying to protect the oceans, and if we want to have a lot more clean energy, there’s a dimension to which you need to industrialize the oceans for energy and there are very few sources of energy that don’t have trade-offs, whether that’s mining critical minerals in Nevada or putting wind turbines offshore. The question is, how do we think about these tradeoffs that don’t paralyze us, but allow us to make some choices and move forward?

Dan Wang: I think yes, I think that’s a good encapsulation. There are always tradeoffs and don’t be paralyzed. I think that’s a great motto.

Jason Bordoff: Well, that’s a great note to end on. I really recommend the book Breakneck to people. Fantastic read and just great to see all the accolades it’s getting, shortlisted for Business Book of the Year in the Financial Times. I’m torn because one of our own scholars here at the Center on Global Energy Policy, Eddie Fishman’s great book Choke Points is also vying for that prize. Maybe it’ll be a tie and you can both win, but well—

Dan Wang: Eddie Fishman’s Choke Points is an excellent book and I shall be very happy if Eddie wins with that.

Jason Bordoff: Breakneck is great. Encourage people to read it and really appreciate your taking time to help us think through all these issues here on the episode today.

Apple is significantly expanding its clean energy projects across Europe with new large-scale solar and wind farms now in development in Greece, Italy, Latvia, Poland, and Romania. Together with a newly operational solar array in Spain, the projects announced today — all enabled by Apple — will add 650 megawatts of renewable energy capacity to electrical grids across Europe in the coming years, unlocking more than $600 million in financing. This will generate over 1 million megawatt-hours of clean electricity on behalf of Apple users by 2030.

As part of the company’s Apple 2030 goal to be carbon neutral across its entire footprint by the end of this decade, Apple is enabling renewable projects to address the electricity European customers use to power and charge their Apple devices. By 2030, Apple plans to match 100 percent of global customer electricity use with clean electricity by bringing new wind and solar power online around the world. The growing portfolio in Europe marks a significant step toward that goal.

“By 2030, we want our users to know that all the energy it takes to charge their iPhone or power their Mac is matched with clean electricity,” said Lisa Jackson, Apple’s vice president of Environment, Policy, and Social Initiatives. “Our new projects in Europe will help us achieve our ambitious Apple 2030 goal, while contributing to healthy communities, thriving economies, and secure energy sources across the continent.”

Product use — the energy it takes to charge and power Apple devices — accounted for about 29 percent of Apple’s overall greenhouse gas emissions in 2024. To address these emissions, Apple supports renewable energy projects that maximize impact on grids around the world, aiming to avoid the carbon that’s emitted by charging and powering Apple devices. The company’s strategy to address these emissions accounts for where Apple products are used, while aiming to protect communities and biodiversity, and prioritizing projects in grids that currently have higher carbon intensity.

Across Europe, Apple is facilitating the construction of large-scale projects that will add around 3,000 gigawatt-hours of renewable energy to the grid each year by 2030. In Greece, the company has signed a long-term agreement to procure power from a 110MW solar project owned and operated by HELLENiQ ENERGY. Now fully operational, the project will support Greece’s transition to renewable energy. In Italy, Apple is supporting the development of a 129MW portfolio of solar and wind projects. The first project — a solar project in Sicily — will come online this month.

In Poland — home to one of the most carbon-intensive grids on the continent — Apple has enabled Econergy’s 40MW solar array, which will be operational later this year. Apple also plans to procure power from Nala Renewables’ 99MW wind farm in Romania’s Galați County through a long-term agreement originated by OX2, which is now constructing the project. And in Latvia, Apple has signed one of the country’s first corporate power purchase agreements with European Energy. Through the long-term deal, Apple will procure electricity from one of Latvia’s largest solar farms to date, which will add 110 MW of clean power capacity to the grid once complete. Apple also enabled the development of a 131MW solar farm developed by ib vogt in Segovia, Spain. The project became operational earlier this year.

As Apple progresses toward its 2030 goal, the company is working to enable renewable energy projects around the world. In addition to investments for product use, Apple and its suppliers support over 19 gigawatts of renewable used to power the company’s global corporate operations and manufacturing supply chain.

The company’s disclosure is one of the clearest indications yet that United States automakers are scrambling to adapt their production plans in response to slowing demand for electric vehicles (EVs).

The EV market also faces fresh strain after the administration of US President Donald Trump scrapped a $7,500 federal tax credit for electric vehicles, a key industry support, with auto executives warning of a sharp near-term drop in battery-car sales before an eventual rebound.

In a filing, GM said it expects “the adoption rate of EVs to slow” following recent policy changes, including the termination of certain consumer tax incentives and reduced emissions-rule stringency.

“The charge is a special item driven by our expectation that EV volumes will be lower than planned because of market conditions and the changed regulatory and policy environment,” GM told the Reuters news agency in a statement.

Carmakers are also working to cushion the impact of Trump’s tariffs, which forced GM to take a $1.1bn hit in the previous quarter.

The company has estimated a bottom-line impact of $4bn to $5bn this year from trade headwinds and said it could take steps to offset at least 30 percent of the blow.

“The charge doesn’t come as a surprise given recent market developments and the fact GM had made probably the most aggressive EV push of any traditional automaker,” said Garrett Nelson, a senior equity analyst at CFRA Research.

“We think the automakers who chose to invest more heavily in hybrid vehicle development, such as Toyota and Honda, are poised to benefit in the US auto market.”

More charges

Both GM and crosstown rival Ford had launched a programme that would have allowed dealers to offer a $7,500 tax credit on EV leases after the federal subsidy expired, before walking back on those plans.

The carmaker warned of possible further charges as it reassesses capacity and manufacturing footprint.

The changes will, however, not affect GM’s current portfolio of its Chevrolet, GMC and Cadillac EVs that are in production.

Charges include a $1.2bn non-cash impairment tied to EV capacity adjustments and $400m for contract cancellation fees and commercial settlements.

GM said the charges will be recorded as adjustments to non-GAAP results for the third quarter, scheduled for early next week.

The green transition is no longer a distant goal; it is a present economic reality shaping industries, investments, and jobs. Across every sector, from energy to transport and agriculture, sustainability has become both a growth driver and a workforce challenge.

Globally, the shift toward low-carbon economies is expected to create 100 million new green jobs by 2030. For Kenya and East Africa, this transition presents a once-in-a-generation opportunity. With over 90% of its electricity already generated from renewable sources, Kenya is uniquely positioned to become a continental leader in green innovation, renewable energy, and the blue economy.

But realizing this opportunity requires more than policy, it requires people. Kenya’s future workforce must be trained not just for employment but for sustainability-oriented industries that will define the next era of economic competitiveness.

1. The Global Surge in Green Jobs

A $10 Trillion Opportunity

The green economy is now one of the fastest-growing segments of global employment and investment. The ILO (2024) estimates that the transition to renewable energy, sustainable manufacturing, and circular economies could generate 100 million new jobs globally by 2030, adding up to $10 trillion in economic output.

The largest areas of job creation include:

Renewable Energy (solar, wind, hydropower)

Energy Efficiency and Building Retrofits

Sustainable Agriculture and Food Systems

Electric Mobility (EVs and battery systems)

Waste Management and Circular Economy industries

However, this green transition also creates a new challenge, a green skills gap. Globally, 70% of employers in renewable energy and sustainability sectors report difficulty finding skilled workers with relevant technical expertise (LinkedIn Global Green Skills Report, 2024).

For countries like Kenya, where youth unemployment remains high but the energy transition is well underway, closing this gap could directly link job creation with environmental resilience.

2. Kenya’s Leadership in Renewable Energy

A Regional Model for Clean Power

Kenya is often cited as a global model for clean energy adoption. As of 2024, over 90% of its electricity generation comes from renewable sources, primarily geothermal, hydro, wind, and solar (Ministry of Energy & Petroleum, 2024).

Flagship projects such as the Lake Turkana Wind Farm (310 MW) and Olkaria Geothermal Complex (865 MW) position Kenya as the largest producer of renewable energy in Sub-Saharan Africa.

The Job Creation Potential

According to the Kenya Renewable Energy Association (KEREA, 2024), the renewable energy sector employs approximately 70,000 people, with projections to reach 200,000 by 2030 as investments in solar mini-grids, off-grid power, and green construction expand.

Key growth areas include:

Solar power installation and maintenance for homes, schools, and SMEs.

Wind energy operations and turbine maintenance in Turkana, Marsabit, and Kajiado.

Geothermal technology and plant management in Rift Valley counties.

Energy auditing and carbon accounting as companies adopt sustainability standards.

Kenya’s advantage lies in its policy stability and technical capacity, but scaling this workforce requires targeted skills programs within TVET institutions.

3. Building TVET Capacity for the Green Economy

Training for Solar, EV, and Water Management Sectors

TVET institutions are central to developing the workforce Kenya needs for the green transition. However, many programs remain focused on traditional trades, while emerging green sectors demand new competencies.

Priority training areas for green jobs include:

Solar PV Installation and Energy Storage Systems

Hands-on certification programs for technicians and engineers.

Integration of safety, maintenance, and off-grid system design.

Electric Vehicle (EV) Technology and Mobility Infrastructure

Courses in EV mechanics, battery maintenance, and charging systems.

Partnerships with private sector pioneers like Roam Electric and BasiGo Kenya to co-develop training modules.

Water and Waste Management Systems

Skills for smart irrigation, wastewater recycling, and urban drainage systems.

Alignment with the Kenya Water Institute (KEWI) and environmental engineering programs.

Competency-Based Green Skills Training

TVETA’s ongoing Competency-Based Education and Training (CBET) reforms are integrating green competencies into technical curricula. By 2025, TVETA plans to introduce green skills frameworks covering renewable energy, climate-smart agriculture, and environmental technology.

Public–Private Collaboration

Collaborations between TVET institutions and private companies are proving transformative.

Strathmore Energy Research Centre (SERC) is training solar technicians and energy auditors.

KenGen is developing geothermal training modules aligned with global standards.

GIZ’s Green TVET Program (2024) supports curriculum development and trainer capacity-building for sustainable industries.

4. Blue Economy: Unlocking Kenya’s Maritime Potential

A New Frontier for Jobs and Innovation

Stretching 600 kilometers along the Indian Ocean, Kenya’s coastline is an untapped resource for the blue economy encompassing fisheries, maritime logistics, aquaculture, marine transport, and ocean-based renewable energy.

The Kenya Blue Economy Strategy (2024–2030) projects that sustainable ocean industries could add KSh 450 billion ($3 billion) annually to the GDP by 2030 and create over 50,000 jobs in coastal counties (Kilifi, Mombasa, Lamu, and Kwale).

Emerging Opportunities

Sustainable Fisheries and Aquaculture

Training in fish processing, cold-chain logistics, and sustainable aquaculture management.

Leveraging partnerships with the Kenya Marine and Fisheries Research Institute (KMFRI).

Maritime Transport and Logistics

Expansion of Lamu Port and Mombasa Port requires logistics coordinators, ship engineers, and maritime safety professionals.

Regional integration under Blue Economy and Maritime Affairs Department (BEMAD) supports workforce development in marine operations.

Marine Renewable Energy and Conservation

Emerging opportunities in offshore wind, tidal energy, and ocean conservation programs.

TVET programs in coastal regions are now aligning with these sectors.

Kenya’s blue economy not only supports job creation but also strengthens climate adaptation, food security, and biodiversity protection.

5. Financing the Green and Blue Workforce Transition

Green Financing Mechanisms

Transitioning to a sustainable economy requires significant investment in green skills development. Kenya’s government, donors, and financial institutions are developing innovative funding models:

Green Climate Fund (GCF): Supporting projects on renewable energy, climate-smart agriculture, and youth training in sustainability.

Kenya Climate Change Fund (KCCF): Financing county-level green projects, with portions allocated to training and education.

Blended Finance Models: Combining public funding, development aid, and private sector capital to fund TVET modernization and renewable energy incubation hubs.

ESG-Linked and Impact Investing

Corporate investors are aligning workforce investments with Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) goals.

Companies like Safaricom, Equity Group Foundation, and KCB Bank are investing in youth training programs for clean energy and climate finance.

For instance, Equity Group’s Young Africa Works Program, in partnership with the Mastercard Foundation, has trained over 300,000 youth in green entrepreneurship and agribusiness since 2022.

The Role of Development Partners

GIZ Green TVET Africa Initiative (2024) provides funding for technical infrastructure upgrades.

World Bank’s Kenya Youth Employment and Opportunities Project (KYEOP) includes green job apprenticeships.

UNDP Kenya Green Economy Program (2024) offers seed funding for startups promoting circular economy solutions.

Financing models that connect skills training to employment outcomes are crucial to sustain the momentum of the green transition.

6. Policy and Institutional Frameworks for a Sustainable Workforce

Kenya’s policy landscape increasingly recognizes the centrality of skills to the sustainability agenda.

Key frameworks include:

Kenya National Green Economy Strategy and Implementation Plan: Mainstreaming green skills in all economic planning.

National TVET Strategy (2023–2027): Emphasizing renewable energy, environmental technology, and smart agriculture.

Climate Change (Amendment) Act 2023: Mandating integration of green growth targets into sector policies.

These frameworks are complemented by partnerships with the Kenya Private Sector Alliance (KEPSA), Federation of Kenya Employers (FKE), and Kenya Association of Manufacturers (KAM), all emphasizing skills as the foundation for climate competitiveness.

7. Future Outlook: Kenya as a Regional Green Skills Hub

The Road to 2030

By 2030, the World Economic Forum estimates that sustainability-linked industries could make up 30% of new jobs across Africa. Kenya’s established renewable infrastructure, educated workforce, and digital ecosystem provide a head start.

To cement its leadership, Kenya should focus on three strategic priorities:

Mainstream Green Skills in All Education Levels: From secondary to higher learning, every curriculum should include climate literacy and sustainability modules.

Strengthen Public–Private Partnerships: Linking employers directly to training programs ensures relevance and employability.

Build a Regional Green Skills Hub: Through the East African Community (EAC), Kenya can lead in harmonizing standards for renewable energy, blue economy, and environmental management.

A Sustainable Workforce for a Sustainable Future

Kenya’s green and blue economies are not abstract ideas, they are real engines of growth that can redefine national prosperity.

The country’s 90% renewable energy milestone and its coastal potential position it uniquely to lead Africa’s sustainable transition.

But the real measure of success will not be in megawatts or exports; it will be in people- skilled technicians, engineers, and innovators who drive a low-carbon, inclusive economy.

By investing in green skills and blue opportunities, Kenya is not only protecting its environment but also securing its place in the global sustainable workforce.

The next decade is not just about adapting to climate change; it is about training a generation to build the future.

Dive Brief:

The PJM Interconnection needs 16 GW of energy storage by 2032, 23 GW by 2040 and 43 GW by 2045 to meet resource adequacy needs and state clean energy goals, the U.S. Energy Storage Coalition said Thursday.

The new industry association’s “Outlook for Energy Storage in PJM,” prepared by Brattle Group, said PJM needs more energy storage to address short-term resource needs amid long waits for large gas turbines and an expected 19% increase in peak load by 2030.

In an email, PJM spokesperson Dan Lockwood said his organization is committed to adding as much supply as possible in the near term, even beyond the 63 GW of projects in its queue as of June. “We need as many of those projects to come online as possible, along with much more new supply,” he said.

Dive Insight:

In modeling PJM energy storage demand out to 2045, Brattle assumed that the system operator will integrate at least 17 GW of new gas generation by 2032 and delay most planned thermal generator retirements until the mid-2030s.

It also assumed that all expected load in PJM’s Long-Term Load Forecast report will materialize. That would boost the grid’s summer peak by 16 GW in 2028 and 30 GW in 2032.

Under those assumptions, Brattle said adequate energy storage deployment could help PJM avoid up to 15 GW of load shed during extreme cold snaps and other “challenging system conditions.” Four-hour storage is the most cost-effective duration to complement PJM’s growing share of renewable generation while maintaining resource adequacy, it added, but stressed that PJM needs to add significant amounts of new gas generation and retain “conventional firm resources” other than storage into the 2040s.

If PJM adds new gas generation more slowly than expected, it will need to compensate by adding even more energy storage than projected, Brattle warned. Without adequate storage reserves, customer costs could increase 30%, due almost entirely to higher capacity prices.

Building out adequate storage to keep pace with an expected 3.5% annual increase in demand through 2032 will be challenging amid global trade uncertainty, the years-long gas turbine backlog, supply constraints for onshore wind components and PJM’s lengthy interconnection queue, Brattle said.

Though most of those factors are outside the grid operator’s control, the report warned that “interconnection queue reform is necessary … to create more opportunity for storage and other dispatchable resources to come online faster.”

PJM says it will process its remaining queue capacity in 2025 and 2026 before transitioning to the first cycle of its reformed interconnection process, which took effect in July 2023. It expects the new process will take one to two years to evaluate projects, faster than recent U.S. averages for interconnection studies.

A separate PJM process to fast-track shovel-ready dispatchable generation resources attracted nearly 12 GW earlier this year. Gas accounted for 69% of the total, with batteries and nuclear accounting for 19% and 12%, respectively.

“PJM has been clear that load growth cannot be met by the projects in the queue alone, given the speed of the forecasted demand increases,” Lockwood said.

The grid operator and its stakeholders “are exploring a number of [other] interconnection methods that could run parallel” to its new interconnection process, such as a recently-approved change that could allow energy-only resources to connect to the grid before required network upgrades are completed, he added.

Still, rapidly rising capacity prices are already pushing retail rates higher in some PJM states.

Democratic Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Republican Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin said in September that they were prepared to leave the organization unless it gave states greater say in its governance.

PJM executives, for their part, say its 13 member states must do more to encourage energy development within their borders. Last month, outgoing PJM President and CEO Manu Asthana called on them to remove siting and permitting barriers for new generators.

Asthana did not single out specific states or generator types, and Lockwood emphasized in his email that “we need energy in all its forms to maintain reliability.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/fitxRJibh9yPA7ACNvrfSrMfO1AoOb07Bs_w1QZ5kSM/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9Eb21pbmlvbl9WaXJnaW5pYV9iYXR0ZXJ5X3N0b3JhZ2UuanBn.webp,N,,2025-10-14 14:03:30.355050

v. U.S. Forest Service et al., is currently before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.","The Arizona Chamber of Commerce & Industry led a coalition of Arizona business organizations in supporting the Resolution Copper project as it advances through the federal appeals process.

In an amicus curiae brief — also known as a “friend of the court” brief — filed with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, the Chamber urged the court to uphold a district court ruling that found the U.S. Forest Service complied with federal law in approving the project. Other signatories include Greater Phoenix Leadership and organizations representing skilled trade workers across Arizona.

The filing comes as the San Carlos Apache tribe and an environmentalist group appeal a trial court decision denying their request to halt the transfer of federal land to Resolution Copper under the 2014 Southeast Arizona Land Exchange and Conservation Act. The plaintiffs contend that the Forest Service’s environmental review under the National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA, was inadequate.

The business and trades groups counter that the district court correctly applied the law and that recent Supreme Court guidance in Seven County Infrastructure Coalition v. Eagle County requires judges to give “substantial deference” to agency experts on environmental reviews.

“Mining enterprises like Resolution Copper are major components of Arizona’s economy and indispensable engines of jobs, community enrichment, and tax revenues,” the amicus brief states. It argues that overly intrusive court review of agency decisions has stifled critical projects through “bureaucratic inertia and prolonged litigation.”

According to the filing, the Resolution Copper project represents an estimated $350 million in initial investment, supports hundreds of contractor and skilled-trade positions, and advances U.S. efforts to secure a domestic supply of copper — a key material for clean energy and defense technologies.

Arizona produces about 70 percent of the nation’s copper and ranks among the top three states for nonfuel mineral production. The Chamber said the outcome of the case carries broad implications for Arizona’s competitiveness and its ability to attract large-scale projects across the energy and manufacturing sectors.

In a regulatory filing on Tuesday (October 14), GM said the charges include a US$1.2 billion non-cash impairment from adjustments to EV capacity, alongside US$400 million in cash-related expenses for contract cancellations and commercial settlements tied to EV investments.

“Following recent US government policy changes, including the termination of certain consumer tax incentives for EV purchases and the reduction in the stringency of emissions regulations, we expect the adoption rate of EVs to slow,” GM said in the filing.

The announcement sent GM shares down nearly 2 percent before the opening bell in New York. The stock has gained about 4.4 percent so far this year, lagging the broader S&P 500 (INDEXSP:.INX), which is up roughly 13 percent.

The setback comes just months after the Trump administration ended the federal EV tax credit, which was previously worth up to US$7,500 for new EVs and US$4,000 for used ones, while also weakening fuel economy and emissions standards.

The administration has also moved to block California’s planned phaseout of new gas-powered vehicle sales and freeze federal funding for EV charging infrastructure.

These reversals have lessened pressure on carmakers to move away from internal combustion engines, tilting the market once again toward gasoline vehicles that deliver higher near-term profits.

Despite current federal policies, the benefits of continuing the upward clean energy trajectory are clear

In the face of growing global climate risks, and a recession coupled with an energy affordability crisis in New Jersey, all barriers that might slow the transition to a clean energy economy must be removed.

While it is true that the transition to a clean energy economy will require more initial investment, it will reduce operating costs as compared to the current policy trajectory, according to the International Energy Agency, and will result in an affordable and fairer energy system for businesses and working families. In addition, switching to clean energy helps mitigate climate change, decrease air pollution, and improve public health. For every dollar invested, renewable energy creates three times as many jobs as the fossil fuel industry.

The good news is that we are well on our way: solar, wind, and battery storage together accounted for 93 percent of power capacity added to the US grid last year. Just before President Donald Trump’s second inauguration in January, US Department of Energy records revealed that nearly three-quarters of clean energy investments under the Inflation Reduction Act — $217 billion of clean energy investments or $1,091 per person — were slated for red states. In addition, $79 billion or $559 per person, was earmarked for blue states.

Approximately two-thirds of those investment dollars were from private companies — companies that were building new factories, investing in clean energy infrastructure, or focused on training and workforce development. In fact, Department of Energy data showed nearly 1,000 new or expanded energy manufacturing plants and 210,000 new jobs had been announced since the IRA went into effect in 2022.

The bad news is that after the inauguration, Trump swiftly signed executive orders promoting domestic fossil fuel production, rolling back regulations on greenhouse gas emissions, and slowing the permitting process for clean energy projects. The president instead went all in on keeping fossil fuel plants open that are long past their prime and opened federal land up to mining. But policies such as investing $625 million to upgrade coal plants, announced at the end of September, will not reverse the economic and technical decline of the industry, which is going the way of steam in the 1840s.

The current federal government shutdown, the first in six years, has given the Department of Energy an excuse to terminate 223 clean energy projects cutting $7.56 billion that was earmarked by Congress for 16 Democratic-led states. The exact total that NJ stands to lose is still emerging. Rutgers Agrivoltaics Program — a model of dual use solar that can increase the profitability of the land and maintain its agricultural productivity while contributing to NJ’s renewable energy goals — saw its federal grant reduced by over $600,000, for example.

Growing Demand and Cheaper Costs Compel NJ to Make the Transition

The Trump administration’s efforts to stall the clean energy transition through executive orders, limit federal tax credits, and cause bottlenecks in the permitting process are short-sighted.

Not only are the public health and environmental benefits of renewables more obvious than ever before, but there is also the economic imperative.

More than 90 percent of new renewable projects are now cheaper than fossil fuels alternatives. At the same time, solar and wind, which have no fuel cost to generate, are now respectively 41 percent and 53 percent cheaper than fossil fuels. Improved technology has lowered the cost of solar panels 99 percent since 1980. And innovations in battery storage literally allow us to harness the sun’s power and send it to the grid as needed, bolstering the grid’s reliability, lowering spikes in power prices, and reducing costs to ratepayers.

Yet the federal government’s initiatives run counter to the administration’s own goal of “energy dominance,” and, in fact, “will make that impossible,” argues NextEra Energy Chair and CEO John Ketchum in a recent Politico article. Ketchum points out that if we do not move forward with clean energy projects, the increase in demand over the next two decades would “make the country vulnerable to energy shortages and reliability problems.”

Expanding renewable energy resources and programs for businesses and homes sets us on a path to, if not “dominance,” then energy independence. Energy independence is critical in this period of increasing international tensions. With wars brewing in every corner of the globe, the US must rely on its own resources to combat geopolitical uncertainty. And with the rapid cuts to renewable energy by the federal government, New Jersey must step up its efforts.

New Jersey’s Leadership Potential

In January, just after Trump’s inauguration, New Jersey announced a milestone in the clean energy transition: the state achieved 5 gigawatts (GW) of installed solar capacity, more than doubling its solar energy output since 2017. The Murphy Administration cheered this significant accomplishment stating that it “underscores New Jersey’s role as a national leader in climate action and clean energy innovation.”

In August, Governor Phil Murphy signed bills into law expanding both community solar and battery storage. In September, during Climate Week, the Murphy administration announced another milestone: New Jersey reached more than 250,000 electric vehicle registrations. On the heels of that announcement, the Murphy administration released a report showing that, since 2021, the state’s green workforce has increased by 12 percent, or 6,000 jobs, with over 100 new clean energy projects built. These green jobs all pay wages higher than the national average.

It is time now, before Governor Murphy leaves office in January 2026, for the State Legislature to codify Executive Order 315, which calls for 100 percent clean energy by 2035. Then the next governor should speed up the clean energy transition, addressing affordability by taking the following steps:

During the first 100 days:

Implement a Clean Energy Standard to maximize in-state job growth and create jobs in the clean-energy economy. Ensure an equitable transition to clean energy through the creation of an Office of Just Transition.

Move forward with a grid modernization plan that identifies the most beneficial and cost-effective projects to modernize NJ’s electric distribution system; speeds up resource-interconnection timelines for clean-energy electric storage systems; increases the capacity of the system to interconnect with distributed energy resources; and improves the resilience of the system against hazards associated with climate change, including extreme heat and flood risk. Require long-term transmission planning, which also protects NJ consumers and ratepayers by addressing rising costs.

During the first year:

Set standards for advanced metering infrastructure, a tool to modernize the grid by enabling electric meters to communicate wirelessly with the distribution network in real time to provide customers and utilities information on electricity usage, outages, and what parts of the grid are stressed.

Create and implement more policies that will reduce emissions through the electrification of vehicles, the improvement of building energy efficiency, and the rapid electrification of buildings.

During the first term:

Collaborate with electric utilities to design time-varying rates that incentivize customers to consume energy off-peak when the grid is less stressed. Use time-varying rates that would result in lower rates when there is less demand on the grid.

Continue to support solar generation — as informed by actual costs — and responsibly developed offshore wind — including the Wind Institute for Innovation and Training at the New Jersey Economic Development Authority. Dedicate increased resources to workforce development and training.

Our next governor and our policy decision-makers must leverage free sources of energy, such as solar, wind, and storage; continue the quest to lower carbon emissions for the betterment of our health and our environment; and push the clean energy transition forward thereby securing our energy independence, creating more good-paying jobs, and making energy more affordable.

Investment in cleantech startups is tracking toward the lowest level in years. But Base Power shrugged off the market trends and just raised $1 billion to turbocharge its home battery buildout.

The colossal Series C funding round comes only six months after it raised $200 million in an April Series B. Addition led the latest round, which brought back all previous investors, including Andreessen Horowitz and Valor Equity Partners. The company’s valuation now stands at $4 billion after receiving the new investment, Base Power founder and CEO Zach Dell said.

The pace and scale of those investments put the Austin, Texas–based firm in a league of its own among clean energy startups this year — beating out even the outlandish $863 million that Commonwealth Fusion Systems raised in August. Dell says his company’s traction comes down to a very clear value proposition: It’s potentially the fastest way to expand on-demand grid power at a time when everyone wants more of it.

“Right now, we’re in a capacity crunch — everyone needs capacity,” Dell said. ​“We install capacity faster and cheaper than really anyone out there.”

The U.S. is going through the fastest electricity demand growth in decades, as AI data centers proliferate, more factories open up, and customers purchase electric vehicles. Utilities have long maintained a skeptical stance toward startups’ plans to turn home energy devices into substantial forces on the grid; now, Dell said, they’re not just willing but ​“more excited than ever” to have that conversation.

The key to Base Power’s model is finding households in Texas who want cheap electricity with the benefit of backup power. The company becomes their retail power provider and installs one or two unusually large batteries on-site. Base owns the batteries, and the customers pay an installation fee starting at $695 and a small monthly rate instead of purchasing them for many thousands of dollars. Then the startup aggregates this dispersed fleet of batteries to essentially create miniature power plants it can profit from in the state’s competitive energy market.

The batteries earn money through simple arbitrage: They charge up when wind or solar production pushes prices down and then discharge when demand and prices spike. Base Power also earned certification to deliver ancillary services, which are rapid-fire adjustments to maintain grid reliability, for which batteries are uniquely suited. The company has already maxed out the 20 megawatts it can bid through the Aggregate Distributed Energy Resource pilot, a virtual-power-plant program, and is pushing for the cap to be raised, Dell said.

Base Power has begun selling its services to regulated utilities so that they can help their customers with backup power and free up more grid capacity. And Dell is scoping out other geographical markets where the rules could allow the Base Power model to grow. But for now, Texas is the ideal place to start. It not only has the competitive market run by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, or ERCOT, but it is also awash in more utility-scale solar and wind than any other state, enhancing the value of battery-based arbitrage.

When Dell spoke to Canary Media for the previous fundraise, he employed 100 people, and his in-house teams were installing 20 home battery systems per day, for a total of about 10 megawatt-hours in March. Now Base Power employs 250 people and installs double that rate. A year from now, Dell wants to install 100 megawatt-hours per month.

That’s a brash goal for a 2-year-old company. But Base Power has actually followed through on its goals, a rare distinction among buzzy cleantech startups. In April, Dell had promised 100 megawatt-hours of cumulative installations by midsummer; he hit that target and is now approaching 150 megawatt-hours.

The firm has also been planning to move from contract manufacturing for its bespoke battery enclosures to in-house manufacturing. In April, Dell said he planned to break ground on a factory near Austin by the end of the year. Now the company has leased the old Austin American-Statesman newspaper headquarters in the heart of town and has begun moving in manufacturing equipment.

“It’s a 90,000-square-foot empty warehouse that happens to be right across the street from our HQ. There’s massive amounts of benefits you get from colocating engineering and manufacturing — having the engineers be really close to the factory, being able to walk the line and make iterations in real time.”

This factory will take imported battery cells and build the modules, packs, and power electronics needed to turn them into large home-battery products. The plan is to start manufacturing in the first quarter of 2026 and ramp up to 4 gigawatt-hours per year of production capacity, Dell said. This supply chain strategy also shores up compliance with new federal rules limiting tax credits for batteries that contain too much content from China.

Base Power is already finalizing a location for a ​“much, much larger” facility outside Austin to continue growing its manufacturing capacity.

Other startups have opted for ​“capital light” strategies to get solar or batteries into the hands of customers. Base Power, in contrast, went capital-heavy, fronting the money to design, own, and install the batteries with the expectation of making future profits on their capacity. It’s too soon to know how that business bet will play out over years, but Dell indicated the early returns were attractive.

“It’s hard to raise a billion dollars without that,” he noted. ​“The math is indeed mathing.”

At the forefront of this race is Saudi Arabia, which has taken ambitious steps to establish itself as a major player in the green hydrogen market. With the announcement of a new hydrogen megaproject, the country is setting its sights on dominating the 21st-century energy landscape. This development not only underscores Saudi Arabia’s commitment to renewable energy but also highlights the strategic calculations driving its energy policies.

Saudi Arabia’s Strategic Move in the Hydrogen Race

Saudi Arabia’s NEOM project has long been heralded as a pioneering venture in the green hydrogen sector. Originally designed to have a 2.2 gigawatt electrolysis capacity, it represented a significant leap in the country’s efforts to lead the energy transition. However, the Saudi government has now decided to expand this vision even further. By nearly doubling the scale of its hydrogen production capabilities, Saudi Arabia aims to cement its status as a leading exporter of green hydrogen.

This strategic decision is driven by several factors. The first is a global ambition to be at the forefront of the clean energy revolution. As countries around the world increasingly turn to renewable energy sources, those who can supply these resources will hold significant geopolitical power. The second factor is the availability of substantial financial resources. Saudi Arabia is leveraging its oil wealth to fund these large-scale projects. Finally, fierce regional competition is pushing the country to maintain its edge. The Middle East is rapidly becoming a hub for clean energy projects, and Saudi Arabia is determined not to be left behind.

Yanbu: A Game-Changer on the Red Sea

The newly announced Yanbu project, situated on the Red Sea coast, represents a bold step forward. Developed in partnership with ACWA Power and Germany’s EnBW, it boasts an impressive 4 gigawatt electrolysis capacity. This facility is expected to generate 400,000 tons of hydrogen annually, which will be converted into green ammonia for global export. Such figures place Yanbu among the largest hydrogen projects worldwide.

What’s particularly notable about Yanbu is its strategic location and design. Positioned to dominate the Red Sea region, it is part of a vision to transform the area into a leading hydrogen hub. Industry leaders recognize its potential, with Hy24’s CEO Pierre-Etienne Franc highlighting the region’s importance for hydrogen development. The infrastructure’s scale and ambition underscore Saudi Arabia’s commitment to redefining global hydrogen production capacities.

The Global Implications of Yanbu

Yanbu’s impact extends well beyond Saudi Arabia’s borders, influencing the global dynamics of the hydrogen market. By partnering with international companies like Germany’s EnBW, Spain’s Técnicas Reunidas, and China’s Sinopec, Saudi Arabia is establishing itself as a central player in the energy transition. These collaborations bring together engineering and technical expertise necessary for such a large-scale project.

In the broader context, the Middle East and North Africa region is already responsible for 10% of global electrolysis capacity under development. Countries like the United Arab Emirates and Morocco are also investing heavily in hydrogen projects. As these nations compete for leadership in the sector, Yanbu is seen as a pivotal project that could give Saudi Arabia a definitive advantage. However, the ultimate success of these ventures depends on market conditions and the global demand for green hydrogen.

Challenges and Opportunities in the Hydrogen Market

While Saudi Arabia’s ambitions are clear, the burgeoning hydrogen market faces uncertainties. Many of these megaprojects, including Yanbu, hinge on final investment decisions. The ambition is palpable, but execution remains a critical test. Additionally, the global market must be able to absorb the vast quantities of green hydrogen that are being promised. The question is whether supply will outpace demand.

Furthermore, Saudi Arabia’s original NEOM project has faced its own challenges. Despite its promising start, it is important to monitor developments and potential setbacks. As the energy transition unfolds, stakeholders must remain vigilant and adaptable to changing circumstances. Will the world be ready to embrace green hydrogen at the scale envisioned by these projects? This question remains central to the future of the energy sector.

As Saudi Arabia pushes forward with its ambitious plans, the world watches closely. The stakes are high, and the outcomes will have far-reaching implications. The question remains: Can Saudi Arabia successfully navigate the challenges and lead the global transition to green hydrogen, or will unforeseen obstacles hinder its progress?

Emissions from burning coal are a leading driver of climate change, which scientists say is raising sea levels and making weather more extreme.

President Donald Trump has made reviving the coal industry a centerpiece of his agenda to increase U.S. energy production. But economists say Trump’s attempts to boost coal are unlikely to reverse its yearslong decline.

The Department of Interior said in a Tuesday statement that last week’s $186,000 bid from the Navajo Transitional Energy Co. (NTEC) did not meet the requirements of the Mineral Leasing Act.

Agency representatives did not provide further details, and it's unclear if they will attempt to hold the sale again.

The leasing act requires bids to be at or above fair market value. At the last successful government lease sale in the region, a subsidiary of Peabody Energy paid $793 million, or $1.10 per ton, for 721 million tons of coal in Wyoming.

President Joe Biden's administration sought to end coal sales in the Powder River Basin of Montana and Wyoming, citing climate change.

A second proposed lease sale under Trump — 440 million tons of coal near an NTEC mine in central Wyoming — was postponed last week following the low bid received in the Montana sale. Interior Department officials have not said when the Wyoming sale will be rescheduled.

NTEC is owned by the Navajo Nation of Arizona, New Mexico and Utah.

In documents submitted in the run-up to the Montana sale, NTEC indicated the coal had little value because of declining demand for the fuel. The Associated Press emailed a company representative regarding the rejected bid.

Most power plants using fuel from NTEC’s Spring Creek mine in Montana and Antelope mine in Wyoming are scheduled to stop burning coal in the next decade, according to an analysis by The Associated Press.",https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/abc_news_default_2000x2000_update_16x9_992.jpg,N,,2025-10-14 13:02:39.401163

The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is starting a new program called “Accelerating Speed to Power/Winning the Artificial Intelligence Race” and has issued a Request for Information (RFI). DOE seeks public input on actions it can take to strengthen the federal government’s role in accelerating critical generation and transmission projects.

The priorities established through Accelerating Speed to Power will impact energy developers and large electricity customers. The RFI is an important opportunity for stakeholders to provide input to help frame the scope of this new DOE focus and shape the programs DOE develops. The deadline for public comments is November 21, 2025.

The “Accelerating Speed to Power” RFI

Through Accelerating Speed to Power, DOE aims to leverage several of its programs, including the Transmission Facilitation Program (TFP), the Grid Resilience and Innovation Partnerships (GRIP) program, the DOE Loan Programs Office loans and loan guarantees, and the DOE National Laboratories’ technical assistance capabilities.

The focus of the RFI is for DOE to gather public input on leveraging its programs for Accelerating Speed to Power. The RFI emphasizes energy projects of at least 3 gigawatts in generation capacity or transmission projects with at least 500 MVA in incremental load serving capability. This can include bringing retired generation back into service or upgrading existing transmission lines.

The RFI requests public input in five specific areas:

Large-scale generation and transmission projects to enable load growth;

High-priority geographic areas for targeted DOE investment;

Best use of or opportunities for DOE funding, financing, and technical assistance;

Load growth trends; and

Grid infrastructure constraints.

Data Centers and Manufacturers

Data center developers and owners are the target audience for DOE’s RFI and are well-positioned to respond and voice their opinions. As the race to build data centers continues, these large load entities should analyze and consider commenting on:

National and local permitting and regulatory regimes to determine where significant barriers to entry exist;

Environmental considerations and clean power commitments, as well as compliance with water and air quality standards that may pose long-term operational constraints and generate friction in light of this administration’s support of traditional thermal resources;

Regional grid constraints to ensure their always-on operations have consistent, reliable power and can reduce their reliance on on-site, emergency backup generation; and

DOE’s existing financial, technical, and programmatic support, and whether any additional types of programs would be beneficial to facilitate data center development and reliable operations.

Energy Developers and Suppliers

Accelerating Speed to Power cites four executive orders (EO) supporting the initiative:

EO 14154 – Unleashing American Energy: Establishes policy to support development of firm resources and rescinds environmental policies including, electric vehicle “mandate,” clean energy, and climate goals.

EO 14179 – Removing Barriers to American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence: Establishes policy to develop AI systems “free from ideological bias,” solidifies the United States’ role as a global AI leader, and rescinds Biden administration EO 14110 – “Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence.”

EO 14262 – Strengthening the Reliability and Security of the United States Electric Grid: Establishes policy to strengthen the reliability and security of the grid and directs the Secretary of Energy to establish anticipated reserve margins using a methodology that accredits firm resources.

EO 14302 – Reinvigorating America’s Nuclear Industrial Base: Establishes policy to expedite and promote deployment of nuclear resources.

Although this suite of EOs generally establishes a preference for traditional generation sources, all power producers should take interest in responding to this RFI. Grid technologies and storage options are evolving rapidly in a way that substantially improves the capacity value of renewable resources like wind and solar, creating an opportunity to make the case to DOE that these resources can provide grid stability.

The RFI also presents an opportunity to influence where and how major transmission projects are sited. In addition, it is an opportunity to engage directly with the Trump administration and shape policy priorities.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15478_5804.jpg,N,,2025-10-14 13:04:38.960906

Shares fell less than 2 percent before the opening bell Tuesday.

The EV tax credit ended last month. The clean vehicle tax credit was worth $7,500 for new EVs and up to $4,000 for used ones.

Meanwhile, the Environmental Protection Agency has been working on easing rules aimed at cleaning up auto tailpipe emissions as the Trump administration move to undo incentives for automakers to go electric. President Donald Trump has also challenged federal EV charging infrastructure money and blocked California's ban of new gas-powered vehicle sales. It adds up to less pressure on automakers to continue evolving their production away from gas-burning vehicles.

EVs were considered to be the future of the US automotive industry. GM had announced in 2020 that it was going to invest $27 billion in electric and autonomous vehicles in the next five years, a 35 percent increase over plans made before the pandemic.

In 2021 GM said that it planned to have more than half of its North American and China factories be capable of making electric vehicles by 2030. It also pledged at the time to increase its investment in EV charging networks by nearly $750 million through 2025.

A year later, GM CEO Mary Barra said that the automaker would sell more electric vehicles in the U.S. than Tesla by the middle of the decade. GM also had a goal of making the vast majority of the vehicles it produces electric by 2035, and the entire company carbon-neutral, including operations, five years after that.

Yet U.S. automakers are being hampered in some of their long-term planning, with drastic changes in economic and environmental policy from one administration to the next. The automakers are also facing increased competition from automakers such as China's BYD, which announced in July that its sales grew 31 percent in the first six months of the year to 2.1 million cars.

BYD's sales have skyrocketed on the back of a government-driven EV boom in China. The rise of BYD and other Chinese electric vehicle makers is a challenge for Tesla and the world's other major automakers as Chinese competitors push into Europe, Southeast Asia and other overseas markets with a relatively affordable option for drivers who want to go green.",https://patch.com/img/cdn20/ap/22940811/20251014/113225/styles/patch_image/public/ap25287409798899___14113036564.jpg,N,,2025-10-14 14:03:53.045148

The Washington Post on the revival of the U.S.-China trade war

The United States and China, inveterate rivals yet inextricably interlinked, are once again barreling into a trade war nobody wants. Tit-for-tat tariffs and export controls, coming after a few months respite, once again threaten to damage the economies of both countries and derail global growth.

China on Thursday blindsided the White House by announcing sweeping new curbs on the export of critical raw earth minerals and magnets, needed in everything from laptops and electric vehicles to U.S. military fighter jets, submarines and missiles. Beijing added five new elements to the seven already subject to stringent export controls.

President Donald Trump responded Friday by announcing new 100 percent tariffs on Chinese goods, as well as new export controls on critical technology destined for China. Trump also threatened to scuttle a planned meeting later this month with Chinese President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of an Asian leaders meeting in South Korea. That sit-down was supposed to lay the groundwork for a full-scale summit early next year.

Both sides left time for an off-ramp. China delayed the start of its new restrictions until Dec. 1. Trump delayed the imposition of his retaliatory measures until Nov. 1. This raises the possibility that the world’s two largest economies are mainly staking out hardline negotiating positions, with threats and ultimatums, to improve their bargaining positions.

Longer term, however, the past 48 hours point toward a looming era of increasing friction as the superpowers shift from competition with occasional cooperation to clashes and outright conflict.

China controls about 70 percent of the world’s rare earth mining and 90 percent of the global processing. It was entirely foreseeable that they would use this market power as a pressure point when Trump picked a fight with Xi earlier this year.

At the same time, China has its own pain points. The United States dominates in semiconductors and chip-design software that China cannot yet manufacture domestically and needs to compete in the artificial intelligence boom. The United States also remains the world’s largest consumer market and accounts for about 15 percent of their exports.

China’s willingness to play the rare earths card has pushed the United States to look elsewhere for alternative sources, something that America should have started doing decades ago. Despite the name, rare earths are actually not all that rare, but they are currently most easily and cheaply mined in China.

The United States has vast deposits of rare earths but significantly trails China and Brazil, partly because of deindustrialization but also because mining certain materials tends to create politically untenable levels of environmental damage. As a result, Trump has been looking to strike minerals deals with countries such as Ukraine, the Democratic Republic of Congo and possibly even Myanmar or Venezuela — all of which are embroiled in conflict but have significant assets below ground.

Even more frustrating than needing access to Chinese minerals to keep the economy going is America’s dependence on them processing and transforming its own minerals into finished products. The United States now exports 95 percent of its rare earths to China for processing because it costs so much less than doing it here. Trying to increase domestic processing capacity could take a decade or more, and permitting remains too cumbersome and slow.

Before the blowup at the end of this week, the two sides had been making conciliatory gestures on trade and seemingly trying to dial down the rhetoric ahead of the heads of state meeting. Trump nixed a $400 million lethal arms package to Taiwan, the self-governing democracy which China considers a renegade province. Trump also lifted a ban on selling AI chips to China. Beijing, in turn, toughened controls on two of the precursor chemicals used in the production of fentanyl, one of Trump’s demands. China also gave the preliminary okay for an American consortium to take 80 percent ownership of TikTok.

The bonhomie after summer trade talks in Geneva and London belied the reality that the United States and China are locked in a herculean struggle for influence and military superiority in the Asia-Pacific region that will define the 21st century. Escalating tensions have led some to speak fancifully of decoupling or delinking of the two economies.

The hard truth is that, for the foreseeable future, the United States and China remain mutually dependent. A trade war is in neither country’s interest. Since a divorce is unrealistic, at least anytime soon, it’s better Washington and Beijing go back to talking.

The New York Times says you should blame Trump when your energy bill goes up

You do not have to care about climate change to believe that clean energy is an important and strategic resource. Solar and wind power are now cheaper than coal in many places and sometimes cheaper than oil and gas. Clean energy sources help both hold down costs for Americans and prevent the United States from having to import so much foreign oil from countries hostile to our interests.

These advantages help explain why the right energy policy for the United States is an all-of-the-above strategy. The country should continue using fossil fuels like natural gas while shifting toward cleaner energy that does less damage to the planet. The combination can help Americans struggling with slow-growing incomes while also addressing climate change.

President Trump, however, has rejected the all-of-the-above approach in his second term. He is instead waging a war on solar and wind power. It is a mirror image of the strategy that conservatives criticize the fringes of the environmental movement for favoring. Rather than trying to put oil companies out of business, Mr. Trump is going after clean energy, and Americans will face higher bills as a result.

Mr. Trump signed a law in July that repealed the clean energy tax credits enacted by former President Joe Biden, eliminating hundreds of billions of dollars of investment into wind, solar and electric vehicles. Mr. Trump has also directed his administration to enact new regulations on clean energy and start specious investigations into its use, including one looking into bird deaths caused by wind turbines. His administration is trying to cancel wind projects off the coasts of Massachusetts, Maryland and Rhode Island, which would provide enough electricity to power more than a million homes. “Windmills, we’re just not going to allow them,” Mr. Trump recently said. Even some oil executives have criticized these moves as shortsighted.

Mr. Trump ran for president promising to reduce the cost of living and of energy prices in particular. He has failed so far. Inflation remains near 3 percent a year even as economic growth and job growth have slowed. Electricity prices are almost 10 percent higher than they were a year earlier, according to the most recent numbers. The main reasons for the electricity price surge have little to do with Mr. Trump and instead involve demand from A.I. data centers and supply constraints from the war in Ukraine. Yet the Trump energy policies are not helping — and will soon make matters worse.

Energy prices are likely to rise the most in states that have not prioritized clean energy, including Kentucky, Missouri and Oklahoma, experts say. The repeal of the tax credits alone may push electricity prices almost 10 percent higher than they would be otherwise by 2029, according to National Economic Research Associates, a consulting firm. Gas prices will also increase over the next decade, according to Rhodium Group, a think tank, as consumers who would otherwise have driven electric cars continue using vehicles that burn fossil fuels.

Mr. Trump’s approach to wind and solar is part of a larger story. It is, along with his tariffs, extreme immigration policies and attempt to take over the Federal Reserve, one more example of prioritizing ideology over the interests of American families.

Mr. Trump’s energy policy also weakens America’s global standing by giving a competitive edge to the country’s chief geopolitical rival, China. For years China has meticulously grown its clean energy industry with government subsidies and other policies. Chinese companies now produce 60 percent of the world’s wind turbines and 80 percent of solar panels.

Mr. Biden’s clean energy tax credits were meant to counter China’s moves. He understood that wind and solar would play an important role in the economy of the future, and that the United States should not let China control the global market. Mr. Biden’s approach was working, creating incentives for the private sector to build big clean-energy projects, including Toyota’s E.V. battery production facility in Liberty, N.C., and a Qcells solar panel manufacturing facility in Cartersville, Ga.

Low energy prices are also good for economic growth. If prices are higher here than in other countries, companies will invest less in America. Consider artificial intelligence: Technology companies are building data centers to power their bots’ processing abilities. These data centers use a lot of electricity. If energy supply cannot keep up with demand, America’s A.I. build-out will lag — again to the benefit of China.

The Trump administration argues that wind and solar are not reliable, and that has some truth to it. If the wind is not blowing or the sun is not shining, power cannot be generated. But this objection is mostly a canard. Advances in battery technology will allow the country to use wind and solar energy during off-hours. Wind and solar also do not have to generate electricity at all times. We have other forms of energy — nuclear, hydro, geothermal and, yes, fossil fuels — to handle the moments that wind and solar cannot. When a country is pursuing an all-of-the-above strategy, varying sources of energy complement one another. They increase overall supply and hold down prices for everybody.

We understand why the political right has sometimes been frustrated by the left’s skepticism of energy abundance. In both Europe and the United States, environmentalists who are rightly worried about the costs and dangers of climate change have at times imagined that the transition could happen more quickly than is realistic. In truth, oil and gas will be necessary to keep prices low and power the economy for years to come. But the political left is not the problem today. The Democratic Party under Mr. Biden expanded domestic oil and gas production while making major investments in clean energy.

The Republican Party has long denied the severe risks that climate change presents and stood in the way of sensible policies to address the extreme storms, flooding and heat that are already happening. Under Mr. Trump, Republicans have gone even further. They have become the party that stands in the way of lower energy prices for American households.

The Wall Street Journal on SCOTUS and racial gerrymandering

Here we go again. The Supreme Court keeps getting dragged into redistricting fights involving race, and this week the Justices will rehear a racial gerrymander challenge to Louisiana’s Congressional map. It could be a landmark that ends the cynical use of race by both major parties to advance their partisan interests.

In recent years, the Justices have considered challenges to maps in Texas, South Carolina, Alabama and Louisiana. They punted last term on deciding the Louisiana case (Louisiana v. Callais) that they will reconsider Wednesday. They will also take up the question of whether the intentional creation of majority-minority districts violates the Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause and the Fifteenth Amendment’s prohibition against abridging a citizen’s right to vote based on race. The right answer is yes.

State Legislatures are caught in a legal vise. If they draw maps that consider race too little, they can be found to violate Section 2 of the 1965 Voting Rights Act. If they weigh race too much, they could run afoul of the Constitution’s Equal Protection Clause.

Liberal groups sued Louisiana after Republicans redrew the state Congressional map following the 2020 Census. The map included one majority-minority district, but the plaintiffs said Section 2 requires a second. They reasoned that because blacks make up 30% of Louisiana’s voting-age population, two of the state’s six districts should be majority black.

Section 2 bars voting practices that discriminate based on race. It also guarantees that minorities have an equal opportunity “to participate in the political process and to elect representatives of their choice.” Congress’s aim was to prevent minorities from being disenfranchised by the likes of poll taxes.

The law’s text doesn’t mention majority-minority districts and stresses that it doesn’t establish a right to proportional representation. But the Supreme Court’s muddled Gingles precedent (1986) read into the law a requirement to draw majority-minority districts on two conditions: when minority populations are large, compact and politically cohesive, and when the majority votes “sufficiently as a bloc” to defeat a minority’s “preferred candidate.”

Courts and legislatures have struggled to divine what this means. Must a minority group’s “preferred candidate” be of the same race? How should courts determine if a minority population is “politically cohesive”? In the Louisiana case, the district court ruled for the plaintiffs and ordered the Legislature to draw a second majority-minority district.

Republicans then drew a 250-mile majority-minority district that snakes from the state’s northwest to Baton Rouge. The district isn’t compact and is barely contiguous. Non-black voters then challenged the new map as a violation of the Equal Protection Clause. A lower court agreed, saying the second district violated Gingles.

In the Court’s recent Allen v. Milligan decision (2023), Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh joined the three liberals in requiring a second majority-minority district in Alabama because the minority population was compact. The other four Justices wrote in dissent that the majority misapplied Gingles and contended that courts should “apply a race-neutral benchmark” in deciding whether maps violate Section 2.

Yet Justice Kavanaugh emphasized in a concurring opinion that “the authority to conduct race-based redistricting cannot extend indefinitely into the future.” This echoed the Court’s SFFA v. Harvard decision striking down racial preferences in college admissions. Map-making now may be the only field in which government sorting by race remains legal.

The Court began to slide shut the door to racial gerrymandering in its landmark Shelby County (2013) decision, which struck down the Voting Rights Act’s Section 4 pre-clearance formula. The Court held that the formula was an anachronism from the Jim Crow era and didn’t account for racial progress. The same is true of the Gingles interpretation of Section 2.

As Louisiana argues, “race-based redistricting rests on an invidious stereotype: that all minorities, by virtue of their membership in their racial class, think alike and share the same interests and voting preferences.”

Justice Clarence Thomas has been making this argument for years in eloquent dissents, and he wrote last term that the Court’s “Janus-like election-law jurisprudence” has created an “intractable conflict between this Court’s interpretation” of Section 2 and the Equal Protection Clause. The result is that “states do not know how to draw maps that ‘survive both constitutional and VRA review.’”

Consider Texas, which was sued by the Biden Justice Department for not drawing enough majority-minority districts. With that case pending in the courts, the Trump Justice Department threatened a legal challenge claiming several districts were “unconstitutional racial gerrymanders.” Texas Republicans this summer used the Trump threat as an excuse to redraw the districts to increase their partisan advantage. Now they are being sued again under Section 2.

The Justices would do the country and themselves a favor by correcting the Gingles error and declaring that the Constitution forbids race-based map-making. As the Chief wrote in a 2006 redistricting opinion, “it is a sordid business, this divvying us up by race.”

The Guardian says the relief is real, but will Palestinian suffering end?

The reprieve brought by the end of fighting in Gaza is immense. In Israel, the release of the living hostages has led to widespread elation. In Gaza and the West Bank there are also celebrations, as up to 2,000 Palestinian detainees start to be released – though there is distress, too, due to uncertainty about who is being freed and where they will be sent. In northern Gaza, people can finally return to dig through rubble for the remains of an estimated 10,000 missing people.

As recently as three weeks ago, the likelihood of a ceasefire appeared remote. But it has taken effect, and on Monday Donald Trump travelled from Jerusalem, where he was cheered in the Knesset, to Sharm el-Sheikh in Egypt. There, he joined a high-powered peace summit of more than 20 world leaders, including Sir Keir Starmer. The plan for peace begun there is due to be continued at a conference in the UK. The US president, acting with international partners, did make this deal happen – despite, not because of, Israel’s prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

Hopes that the deal marks the first step toward Palestinian statehood are understandable – but, given historical precedent, somewhat optimistic. It offers no clear path to sovereignty for Palestinians and risks splitting, for the foreseeable future, Gaza from the West Bank. Then there is the utter devastation this war leaves behind. The lack of any timeline for Palestinian self-determination in Mr Trump’s plan gives the lie to vainglorious references, in his Knesset speech, to the “historic dawn” of a “golden age”.

The US president could not help himself polarising and personalising the deal in his speech. In a moment of relief – with the hostage release, ceasefire and resumption of aid – he chose to recast it as a morality play in which he alone restored Israel’s honour after supposed betrayal by former US presidents Obama and Biden. This despite the Biden administration a year ago having attempted a similar deal: a ceasefire tied to humanitarian access and eventual political talks.

A plan that denies one side meaningful agency cannot yield legitimate peace. The ceasefire and aid trucks are to be welcomed. But this is not yet political progress. Without mechanisms guaranteeing Palestinian participation and control over their own institutions, any deal risks freezing subjugation under the language of peace.

Gaza’s people desperately need humanitarian aid – and food and medicines must be the first priority. But reconstruction cannot wait. Amid 60m tonnes of rubble, Palestinians need help restoring homes, schools, hospitals, mosques and other institutions shattered by Israel’s invasion. For Gaza’s transitional administration to succeed, funding must flow quickly and security gaps be filled. Like much of Mr Trump’s peace plan, references to an international stabilisation force and a proposed “board of peace”, with Sir Tony Blair, are alarmingly vague.

Strong international support for the Palestinian Authority, enabling it to take over from Hamas, is probably the most promising possibility. The enormous suffering of the past two years means the moral case for a resolution to the conflict is arguably more urgent than ever. But while the ceasefire, the return of the hostages and commitment by Hamas to “demilitarise” Gaza should be acknowledged as positive steps, Mr Trump’s record gives little reason to believe he will deliver – or feel bound to try. Short-term relief does not mean that the prospect of a Palestinian state has been brought closer.

The St. Louis Post-Dispatch on Trump's crackdowns on student visas

“When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best. They’re sending people that have lots of problems. They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.”

So declared Donald Trump in 2015, kicking off a presidential campaign rooted in hatred, fear and xenophobic myth — though at least tempered by the “good people” afterthought.

But 10 years later, it turns out “good people” from around the world aren’t welcomed in Trump’s America, either. Even foreign college students here legally and on their own dime to study in America’s great universities — the very definition of the “best of the best” — are getting the signal loud and clear that this president doesn’t want them here.

In St. Louis, as around the nation, colleges and universities have seen their enrollment of foreign students here on student visas plummet this year. Some of it’s due to stricter student visa requirements the administration is imposing for no good reason. Others are choosing not to come here out of concern about whether they will be allowed to stay and work after graduation — a concern exacerbated by the administration’s new $100,000 H-1B work visa fee on American employers who want to hire foreign workers in specialty occupations.

Still others, presumably, are repelled by the toxic and increasingly brazen anti-immigrant rhetoric from the MAGA movement and its expanding campaign to rid America of anyone not born here.

That campaign is especially self-destructive when it comes to supporting American higher education. Unlike most American-born college students, foreign students who study here generally are paying top tuition rates, a financial lifeline for institutions that have struggled with diminishing public funding and declining enrollment by American-born students.

As the Post-Dispatch’s Monica Obradovic reports, a survey of four St. Louis-area universities found a drop in international enrollment of more than 2,700 students this year compared to last. St. Louis University alone has dropped by more than 1,500 international students. Washington University in St. Louis is down almost 1,000 foreign students. Southern Illinois University-Edwardsville is down 15%.

It’s part of a national trend that has dire implications for America’s economy. The NAFSA Association of International Educators estimates that foreign students contribute close to $44 billion to the economy annually, including supporting more than 378,000 jobs here. The New York Times reported this month that nearly 20% fewer international students arrived in the U.S. for the start of the current school year in August compared to last year. That’s the largest one-year drop on record except for the 2020 pandemic year.

Some of the administration’s student visa revocations have been in response to foreign students engaging in peaceful protest against U.S. policy regarding Gaza and other controversies. That’s a shameful statement to the world about how little our current president values our own First Amendment.

But most of the decline in international students is due to stricter student visa restrictions, travel bans from specific countries — and students simply (and understandably) declining to come here because of the current xenophobic political climate fueled by this administration. A spokesperson for Webster University in St. Louis County, for example, told the Post-Dispatch’s Obradovic that the private school has seen international enrollment fall at its three domestic campuses in favor of its seven foreign campuses.

The issue is bigger than money. International students tend to be the best and the brightest from their countries. A 2022 report from the National Foundation for American Policy found that fully one in four billion-dollar American startups have founders or co-founders who initially came here as international students. George Mason University reported in 2024 that almost one-third of Nobel laureates affiliated with American academic institutions were born somewhere else.

In terms of both economic and intellectual benefit to the U.S., these are exactly the “good people” Trump alluded to a decade ago. Yet under his current regime, they’re being expelled, barred or just convinced to stay away in record numbers. We’re all the poorer for it.

For thousands of years, Indigenous people stewarded their forests with fire. This cultural burning is part traditional food and craft production, part environmental protection and part ceremony with the land. Western settlement transformed the region with mining and logging, uprooting Native peoples and putting out cultural fire practices.

In the 19th century, California lawmakers suppressed the burns. An 1850 law made it legal to fine or punish anyone burning land. The 1911 Weeks Act instituted a policy of total fire suppression, dictating that state and federal agencies should control wildland fires to prevent their spread. This made cultural fire illegal at a federal level. Native people were shot and imprisoned for starting fires.

A tree ring chronology of the forest burn scars from 1600s to 2015. The text points out where in 1850, California banned cultural fire. Again in 1911, as part of the Weeks Act, the U.S. passed measures to suppress fires nationwide.

Now, after a new generation of tribal and community members organizing, educating and lobbying about the benefits of bringing fire back to the land, this time-honored practice is returning. Last fall, California enacted legislation allowing federally recognized Native American tribes to conduct cultural burning, acknowledging their sovereignty and history with the land.

The legislative victory allows tribes to set fires with less federal oversight and recognizes cultural burning as a way to make the state resilient to wildfires. Two Washington Post reporters traveled to Northern California to witness the practices firsthand.

Living with fire

I .

We watched them paint with fire. Water hoses in hand, two men corralled a three-foot-high fire as it moved through an open field, hosing down grass to keep the flames under control. It’s a scene that normally spells wildfire disaster. And yet the fire moved alongside the group.

They’re cultural fire practitioners: trained and recognized by tribes to guide and manage blazes. This particular group was led by Bill Tripp, the director of natural resources and environmental policy for the Karuk Tribe. It was the end of June when we caught up with them as they burned farmland in Orleans, California, about 50 miles south of the Oregon border.

Like most burns for tribes native to this stretch of the Klamath River, their activity encourages native species growth, reduces wildfire risk and protects raw materials for craft. They conducted it on the Karuk-owned Tishaniik Farm, an agriculture project that started during the pandemic to provide food for the community.

As they moved along the field ,

so went

the fire.

In its burned path

the “black line” appeared.

There’s clear skill in reading a fire: when to stop it, how to use the terrain to their advantage, when to let it go. The crew has now erected a perimeter around the field working counterclockwise. They stopped when the black line reached the top of a hill, extinguished the flames, doubled back from where they were to start new fires and then let the prevailing wind and slope work with the fresh fires.

From the back of the truck, two men hosed down either side of the fire. They guided the flames to move along and cut perimeter around the field. By encircling the grasses, they can contain the blazes.

They’re using the terrain, Tripp pointed out, so the fire will burn up toward the other end of the black line without getting out of control.

A burn is different from a prescribed fire, which the U.S. Forest Service uses to protect against major wildfires. While the agency works to reduce fodder for a possible blaze, Indigenous-led fires aim to protect their way of life.

Both can produce harmful smoke, detractors of the practices point out. Research shows prescribed fires produce around 17 percent of the fine particle pollution of a comparable wildfire, and make uncontrolled blazes less likely in the future.

While the acreage involved in burns can be much smaller, it can benefit the landscape in the same ways as a prescribed fire. Some researchers emphasize centering traditional knowledge in managing fire-prone forests and vegetation since these communities often take steps to avoid having blazes run out of control. New Mexico’s worst-ever recorded fire, the Hermit’s Peak/Calf Canyon fire in 2022, took place when the Forest Service’s prescribed burns spread during windy conditions.

Such incidents are rare, however. Fire practitioners pay attention to local conditions to determine when and for how long to burn. Tripp started the burns late in the afternoon, aiming to slow the fires with the rising humidity.

By 6 p.m., the truck returned roadside along the river with a fresh tank of water. They moved the fire downhill toward the road, completing the perimeter. The seven-foot-wide burned path is meant to keep the fire from spreading, and the nearby gravel road will not burn. Earlier Bill pointed out a patch of yellow grass running through the black line. Easy to miss, but he said they would wet it down so the fire wouldn’t escape and burn a nearby field.

Once the outer edges of the area were completed, everyone began lighting around the field from the outside in. Aaron Pole, a Hoopa tribe member and natural resource technician, passed by us just shy of a jog to pull the truck out and said: “Now the hard work’s done and you let the fire do its thing.”

The flames changed in velocity and size within 10 minutes, stretching up as high as a house. One could feel their heart pulsing under their skin. Seeing the billowing fires confuses the brain on whether one should panic or not. A rush of air picked up as the fires consumed the oxygen from inside the field. Everything sped up while little vortexes of grass and flame would spin up and peter out. Excited whoops went out from around the site.

And just like that ,

by 8:30 p.m. ,

the fires were gone.

Bringing fire back to the land

II .

The Cultural Fire Management Council (CFMC), which practices on the neighboring Yurok Reservation and its ancestral lands, postponed its burns that week after spotting quail eggs in a nest. The organization has been training the next generation of community members leading burns for over a decade. Margo Robbins, the council’s co-founder and executive director, said that the fires would wait until fledglings can make their way to safety.

A 2024 paper on cultural burning estimates that before Western colonization, the Karuk Aboriginal territory along the Klamath River had nearly 7,000 ignitions a year. That’s an average of 19 ignitions a day over an area 3½ times the size of New York City. Researchers estimate that at the time, every Indigenous person ignited two to a dozen fires a year.

Robbins came to cultural burning through weaving baskets, for which Yurok tribes are renowned. These technological marvels can be watertight and can be used for cooking, for carrying infants and toddlers, and in ceremonial rituals. The weaving material, though, needs fire to exist.

The California Hazelnut, a squat underbrush shrub, grows its shoots straight when burned. When Robbins started, the raw materials were hard to come by.

The CFMC launched its burns in 2012, working with their community group, California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection and the Yurok Tribal Council, burning seven acres. The next year, they burned 67 acres. Working with the Nature Conservancy, four local tribes, and state and local parks, the council now has 23 employees.

At her home, she showed us piles of hazelnut branches in her craft room lying in wait to be split and bound. Along her shelves are beaded necklaces, some for the flower dance ceremony, and smaller baskets she’s made. Robbins held up an incomplete one — a tight matrix of bright blond and dark material — that her late grandmother started but never completed. Maybe she’ll finish it one day, she said with a smile, placing it back.

Frank Lake, a research ecologist with the U.S. Forest Service and co-author of the 2024 study simulating precolonial burn rates, says it’s clear tribes native to this region intentionally modified the landscape. Lake, who has Karuk ancestry with Yurok family members, centers much of his scientific work on tribal knowledge, bearing out what is known through recorded history, oral history and available data.

Lake pointed to the impacts of excluding fire in the region, including overgrowth of trees in the Klamath Mountains, loss of biodiversity and denser tree crowns ripe for severe wildfires.

“The landscape is sick,” said Lake, a tribal resident and liaison.

Using the Karuk word “pikyav,” meaning “to fix,” he called the recent adoption of fire practice a powerful moment where national interests can be met when tribal leadership is empowered. As Lake’s grandfather put it, “fire is medicine.”

Since colonization, forests and vegetation have shifted from their historic roots. Invasive plant growth can make wildfires more severe, a risk that researchers say is compounded by drought and hotter temperatures.

This map shows vegetation departure from pre-colonization overlaid on wildfire risk as a measure of how non-native forests and vegetation might contribute to fire risk.

Lake challenged assumptions about what’s “natural” with his understanding of the landscape. If fires tended the hillside by protecting acorn-bearing tan oak trees, is that a forest, or is that an orchard? His research shows tribes have shaped crops with fire for centuries. Now living in a time where burns are legal again, he spoke about how he feels privileged to raise his son in this moment. But the Trump administration, which has pushed for the “immediate suppressing of fires,” could reverse some of the new policies aimed at reintroducing fires to the landscape.

“We hustle because we know time is limited,” Lake said.

Fire ecology

III .

“The more you work in the West, the more you work with fire.” That was Gavin Jones’s experience when his study on spotted owl habitats pivoted after the birds’ roosts went to ash.

Jones is a research ecologist with the Rocky Mountain Research Station. Studying the threatened species, he found that wildfires play a role in where the birds choose to live. The owls prefer a Goldilocks-home: not pristine, not too fire scarred, something burned just so.

Historically, Jones said, fire was an enormous part of the landscape in much of the western United States. But fire suppression policies led to dramatic changes by the late 1800s. In colder and wetter forests like those in the Pacific Northwest, a fire’s ability to spread is now dictated by warmer temperatures, while blazes in forests like those along the Sierra Nevada range became fuel-limited, meaning they depend on available fuel sources like dry grasses, combustibles or water-stressed trees.

Centuries of excluding fire from these forests meant higher tree density and less biodiversity. Jones says that on the evolutionary scale, fire adaptation can happen pretty rapidly, especially after a sudden shift. “It is a strong selection force.”

Burns encourage more variation in the forest landscape, which leads to greater biodiversity — but there are hard limits. Even in species like the black-backed woodpecker, which needs a burned area for its habitat, few were found after the 2013 Rim and 2014 King wildfires.

Researchers like Tom Swetnam, a professor emeritus of dendrochronology and fire history at the University of Arizona, warn that cultural fire can’t be applied to all forests, since in some places this traditional knowledge has been lost.

“It’s not an obvious solution for everywhere,” Swetnam said.

Robbins with the CFMC took us to the Weitchpec transfer station, a 20-minute drive from the Tishaniik Farm, where some of the oldest continually treated forest projects are. We saw how different the understory could feel. Sunlight blankets what is otherwise a claustrophobic and shady part of the woods.

Robert McConnell — the council’s burn boss, or fire manager — reached out to grab a hazelnut branch basking in the sun as he told us about the group’s first burn here in 2012. As he petted the low brush with care, I noticed the stark contrast with a darker patch of forest over his shoulders: That land is off limits to burning. Dense with fir trees, you could scarcely see through it, while we stood in an open area marked by thickets of low grasses, shrubs and oak trees.

Robert peered into the hollow burn scar in a conifer, its dark corners now an animal’s storehouse for hazelnuts. Nearby, native potatoes and berries grew unabated. McConnell examined where someone had been harvesting branches for basket materials, concluding that it must have been recent. These resources are all made possible from burning here, he said, pausing to listen for the call of a variegated woodpecker.

A recent study by Gavin Jones found that continuing under the status quo of fire exclusion in the Sierra Nevada range would mean a 64 percent chance of complete forest loss in the next 50 years. That risk increased to a near total loss by the end of the century. Forest restoration through mechanical thinning and beneficial fire, like cultural burns, reduce these chances to single digits.

When massive fires break out, both prescribed and managed burned forests do better. A study by Jones and others from earlier this year found that treated areas in southwestern New Mexico burned less severely by 21 to 55 percent. Good fire-centered forest management is filtering into how the country reduces wildfire risk.

All Hands All Lands, a cooperation of tribal and civic organizations leading burns in the region, cleared out brush and set fires along the sloping hillside by the Klamath River. Staring at the blazes along Sandy Bar Ranch, her home and business, Blythe Reis said she feels protected when the temperature reaches 100 degrees and when lightning strikes come. “We’ve been doing controlled burns on our property for eight to 10 years now. It just makes you feel safer.”

On our last day with Tripp, he took us through back roads to a site where they first started prescribed burns. Along the way we stopped for a sip of fresh spring water flowing from a rocky hillside, noting that burns improve the health of nearby springs.

Tripp started burning at the age of four, after his grandmother caught him making fires and told him that he might as well be useful. He figured out how to move the fire, contain it, and kindle new areas in his backyard. For the next few years his grandmother would tell him stories of cultural fire every night, and one night when he was eight, she asked him, “Now that you have this knowledge, what are you going to do with it?

The next day, a few miles from the Oregon border, I found myself talking with a postal worker in the town of Happy Camp who suggested I drive some 40 minutes up the road to see the burn scar. Though it has been five years since the devastating Slater fire, the landscape feels as though fires tore through recently. There’s barely a sound, and wind sweeps freely through the matchstick remains of conifers.

The Advisory Board meeting was held from September 23 – 25.

EPA had announced the e-Manifest Advisory Board meeting and also included in the Federal Register notice:

Charge Questions posed to the e-Manifest Advisory Board.

Background White Paper providing information on the issues to be discussed by the Board.

ASTSWMO describes itself as an organization representing the 50 States, 5 Territories and the District of Columbia whose mission is to enhance and promote effective State and Territorial programs and to affect relevant national policies for waste and materials management, environmentally sustainable practices, and environmental restoration.

The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) cradle-to-grave Hazardous Waste Tracking System attempts to ensure that hazardous waste is properly generated, transported, and treated or disposed. The cradle-to-grave system has always been a key component of RCRA.

Federal legislation enacted in 2012 tasked EPA with the development of a national electronic manifest system. Further, it authorized the federal agency to assess the cost of developing and operating an e-Manifest system from user fees. Such fees would be charged to those who use the hazardous waste manifest to track off-shipments of their waste.

The e-Manifest system is a national database that similarly tracks hazardous waste shipments. It was launched by EPA in 2009. The goal of the e-Manifest system is to improve access to higher quality and timely data while also saving time and resources for industry, state, and territorial programs.

ASTSWMO notes in its September 16th comments that the theme of the Advisory Board meeting is referenced as:

Accelerating the Future: Phasing out Paper Manifests to Unlock the Full Potential of e-Manifest.

ASTSWMO states that it has reversed its position regarding retention of use of paper manifests. It states that the organization:

…now supports the use of fully electronic manifests.

One stated reason for this position is the concern that because data quality issues persist, it believes that maintaining two separate systems is contributing is contributing to such problems and that a transition to fully electronic manifesting, with all entities providing an electronic signature is preferrable.

Additional points raised in the ASTSWMO comments include:

Coordinating with the U.S. Department of Transportation is necessary, as it appears to be one of the most significant impediments to achieving a fully electronic e-Manifest system (noting DOT requires a physical paper copy of the manifest to be in the transport vehicle).

If EPA chooses to sunset paper manifests and transition to a fully electronic system:

Facilities that are normally very small quantity generators but have an episodic event should be required to register with the e-Manifest system in order to retain records.

EPA should consider the impact of the paper sunset requirement on the use of voluntary manifests as contemplated in the e-Manifest Frequently Asked Questions.

Supports EPA requiring e-Manifest registration for all entities involved in the waste handling process, including the generator, transporter, and the designated facility.

Supports removing the existing paper-based manifest record-retention requirements (entities currently required to maintain a paper manifest should be obligated to establish and maintain electronic access to their manifest via the e-Manifest system).

Supports a delayed enforcement and compliance approach to sunset paper manifests.

Appreciates EPA’s acknowledgement of state regulators and providing user support and management of the user registration process.

Supports EPA hosting an e-Manifest User Conference as outlined in the Background White Paper.

Added work on e-Manifest information has stretched limited state program resources and may not be sustainable without revisiting funding levels or expectations of workload.

agrees with EPA’s proposal related to the replacement manifest as outlined in the Background White Paper in the event that the e-Manifest system becomes temporarily unavailable for electronic manifest tracking.

Leading professors and practitioners choose the top articles each year through a competitive peer review process of hundreds of articles. The final honorees represent “the most insightful thinking” on a wide range of current and emerging legal issues in the field, according to the company’s website.

“I am extremely proud of this paper, and it means the world to me to have it recognized by fellow scholars and practitioners of environmental law,” Rothschild said. “The project allowed me to combine my legal expertise with my training in the history of science, and I hope it will prove valuable to both scholars and judges grappling with recent developments in environmental and administrative law doctrine.”

First published in the Indiana Law Journal, Rothschild’s article takes a deep dive into the roots of the US Supreme Court’s “major questions doctrine,” with the aim of understanding this history’s implications for current litigation over environmental and public health regulations. The major questions doctrine maintains that federal agencies must have explicit authority from Congress to enact regulations with significant economic or political impact.

Rothschild’s article shows that the roots of the doctrine go back to the Supreme Court’s 1980 decision in Industrial Union Department, AFL-CIO v. American Petroleum Institute, commonly known as the “benzene case.” In that decision, the court invalidated new restrictions on workplace exposure to benzene, a toxic chemical that can cause leukemia.

The article employs hundreds of archival documents and a dozen oral histories to understand the underlying science behind the benzene regulation and why the justices ruled as they did. As Rothschild demonstrates, unsubstantiated fears that regulation of carcinogens would cripple US industry and doubts about the adequacy of scientific research regarding benzene’s harms led the court to strike down the exposure limits.

The paper then details problematic parallels between the benzene case and other “major questions” decisions, notably exaggerated economic effects, disregard for statutory constraints on agency discretion, and deference to unqualified scientific experts. Rothschild argues that the benzene case’s history and legacy should thus “caution us from continuing down a path that devalues expertise and the role of the democratically elected branches in protecting the public.”

However, one major barrier to widespread adoption remains. While some people have the freedom, space and financial ability to install a charging station at their home, many do not. Additionally, the lack of publicly available charging stations hinders the convenience of driving an EV long distances.

In cities, where most people live in apartment buildings and space is scarce, owning an EV is nearly impossible due to the lack of charging options. Researchers at Penn State set out to solve this problem by integrating EV chargers into existing streetlights. They published their findings in the Journal of Urban Planning and Development.

Test subject: Kansas City

The research team created a scalable framework to develop and analyze the possibility of using streetlights as EV chargers. They installed 23 streetlight charging units in Kansas City, Missouri, and collected data over one year.

The researchers found that their charging stations were more cost- and time-efficient, had less environmental impact and were more convenient and accessible than traditional EV chargers.

“Streetlight poles are already powered and typically owned by municipalities, making them relatively easy to work with. Their placement – often near on-street parking and in high-traffic areas – makes them well positioned to serve both local residents and visitors,” said Xianbiao Hu, an associate professor of civil and environmental engineering at Penn State.

The project was funded by the U.S. Department of Energy and conducted in partnership with the non-profit organization Metro Energy Center, local utilities companies and the National Renewable Energy Lab.

Scaling up

The team created a three-pronged approach for other communities to use to install and use their own streetlight charging stations. The plan is focused on demand, feasibility and benefits. Researchers determined demand by evaluating land use, station density, nearby points of interest and traffic volume. They used this data to train AI models to make demand predictions.

“The scalability was a huge part of what makes this framework important,” said corresponding author Yang Song, a doctoral student at Penn State at the time of the research, “Creating something that works not just in one specific city but that can be adopted by many communities easily is critical for increasing EV use across the country.”

The model helped the researchers choose the 23 streetlights that became charging stations in Kansas City. The streetlight chargers had significantly shorter charging times, likely because they drew power from the dedicated municipal electrical lines and had less competition from charging multiple vehicles simultaneously.

The streetlight chargers were also less expensive to install since the infrastructure was already in place. The researchers found that the chargers contributed to a 11.94% greater avoided gasoline consumption and 11.24% higher GHG reductions compared to traditional EV charging stations.

The team is working on refining their predictive models to incorporate socio-economic data and weather information.

A slowing US market

Bloomberg reports that global sales of EVs continue to rise and are estimated to represent one in four cars sold in 2025. Electrification is also rising in buses and two- and three-wheelers. Almost half of bus and two- and three-wheeler sales were from electric vehicles.

Globally, China dominates the EV market. Over half of the vehicles sold in China are electric. Battery manufacturing is also heavily concentrated in China.

Meanwhile, sales in the U.S. are slowing, possibly due to policy changes and uncertainty. Bloomberg lowered their prediction for the number of EVs in 2030 from over 35 million to under 25 million.

Adoption of plans for more chargers, like the Penn State project, could help support lowering sales in the U.S. by making EV ownership more convenient and cheaper than traditional vehicles.",https://www.rdworldonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ev-charger-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-14 13:02:27.189293

Dive Brief:

Harris County, Texas, sued the Environmental Protection Agency Monday for canceling its Solar For All grant funding. Harris County received one of the largest Solar for All Awards in 2024.

The EPA eliminated the program in August, citing the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, but the lawsuit states “the OBBBA provides no authority for EPA’s Elimination Decision.”

“The Trump administration is breaking the law to score political points, and Harris County residents shouldn’t have to pay that price,” Harris County Attorney Christian Menefee said in a statement posted on social media. “Congress appropriated this funding, EPA awarded it to Harris County after a rigorous competitive process.”

Dive Insight:

Monday’s lawsuit follows a similar, separate complaint filed last week by a coalition of community and labor groups. That suit says the EPA’s termination of Solar For All was unconstitutional and caused them harm.

The Texas Solar for All Coalition was awarded nearly $250 million in 2024 to expand solar access across the state as part of the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund established by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. Harris County — the state’s largest county and home to Houston — led the coalition and secured more than $54 million.

On August 7, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced his agency would no longer implement the $7 billion Solar for All program, saying the OBBBA “repealed EPA’s authority to administer the program and rescinded all remaining funds.”

Zeldin said very little of the money had been spent and recipients were “still very much in the early planning phase, not the building and construction process.”

On Sept. 2, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit supported the EPA’s termination of Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund grants, stating the Biden administration modified the grant agreements “to make it more difficult for the government to terminate the grants.”

Harris County’s lawsuit asserts the OBBBA rescinds only $19 million in unobligated administrative costs, not the grant funds that were obligated by the IRA’s Sept. 30, 2024, deadline.

Rescinding the funding causes “irreparable harm to Harris County and its constituents,” the lawsuit states. “Harris County personnel and Texas Coalition staff have dedicated countless hours to setting up operations for Solar for All and working to deliver the program’s benefits to their constituents,” the plaintiffs state.

Eliminating the grants upends the county’s budgetary and strategic planning and undermines its reputation “as a reliable community and business partner,” according to the lawsuit.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/66Tg5rTe7TNuToR04WHwveLWdW4lclCRv1Jcsosl8xM/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0xMTc4MTY5NzE3LmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-10-14 14:03:40.912157

The companies and countries that control critical grid materials will set the pace for the next energy revolution.
It would cost over $25 billion just to build out the required capacitor film lines, as an example.
Reshoring capacitor film manufacturing alone can reclaim $200 billion annually while securing today’s grid and tomorrow’s fusion revolution.
If we continue outsourcing energy supply chains, we risk national security and forfeit the economic benefits of our energy transition.","Jim Welsh is CEO of Peak Nano.

National security requires self-reliance and independence. Today, America’s energy infrastructure and supply chain face a critical test of both.

Electrification, AI, data centers and extreme weather are driving unprecedented demand for energy and grid reliability. The U.S. Department of Energy’s latest Grid Reliability Report makes one thing clear: the time for “business-as-usual” is over. The U.S. can’t keep up, let alone grow, on old infrastructure. We need a radical shift to expand, modernize and intelligently manage the grid.

Success depends on bold investments in digital technologies, enhanced equipment and advanced grid management. Together, these will enable real-time monitoring, rapid integration of renewables and far less energy lost in transmission, which today can range from 8-12% of power generation. That’s how America will meet surging demand and protect its global leadership in the AI era.

The U.S. has an Achilles’ heel: critical materials. At the heart of grid reliability are magnets, rare-earth minerals and dielectric film. These materials are often overlooked but are vital for our power infrastructure, grid reliability and every part of our energy security. Dielectric films, for example, are used in capacitors that condition power, convert AC/DC power, keep power flowing steadily and even help manage spikes in demand to keep the grid stable and secure.

The problem? The U.S. has outsourced our ability to replace failing transformers, capacitors and other critical grid components. Capacitor film — a highly engineered, ultra-thin plastic that enables power stability and distribution for our grid — is almost entirely made overseas, and 75% is made in China, which dominates the global supply.

Every year, we spend nearly $200 billion overseas for this film and other critical materials. Historically, we’ve migrated our capacity to manufacture it overseas. No American manufacturer even builds the equipment to make dielectric films.

This isn’t just an economic drain that creates risk for the U.S. It’s a huge strategic liability threatening our national security and stifling innovation at the moment our nation needs it most to drive AI and defense. To close this gap and lead the new energy era, we must reshore manufacturing and upgrade the supply chain for these core materials.

As DOE Secretary Chris Wright stated, “If we are going to keep the lights on, win the AI race, and keep electricity prices from skyrocketing, the United States must unleash American energy.”

The hidden costs of offshoring

Between subsidies and coordinated industrial strategy, China dominates clean energy supply chains. Its factories are running far beyond demand, creating an overcapacity that keeps prices low and puts Western manufacturers on the back foot.

Our reliance on foreign supply chains to uphold our energy infrastructure leaves us dangerously exposed. Our capacitor film supply could be cut off at any moment. The consequences would be immediate and severe, triggering blackouts, crippling industries and derailing America’s position in the global energy race.

Even with more limited supply disruptions, utilities could face delays, spikes in cost and worse — compromised reliability during peak events like heat domes, extreme weather and surging data center loads.

The case for reshoring

Building secure domestic supply chains for grid materials like capacitor film will fuel U.S. economic growth and technological leadership, supporting the creation of a high-skilled workforce and robust manufacturing capacity here at home. Grid-enhancing technologies also foster trust in our energy infrastructure and provide long-term cost stability for ratepayers.

We’re talking about a global film capacitor market that stood at $4.1 billion in 2024 and is projected to reach $10.3 billion by 2030, with a CAGR of 31.5%, according to Grandview Research. Beyond this market, reshoring is our path to claim billions (even trillions) in nuclear and commercial fusion, with film technology that can support high-temperature operations.

The companies and countries that control critical grid materials will set the pace for the next energy revolution.

Read More in Regulation & Policy

Recent federal action — the One Big Beautiful Bill Act has changed the playing field for power strategy with its focus on expanding U.S. manufacturing, 24/7 power generation resources and U.S. sources of critical materials. However, this alone is not enough to close the gap with countries that have benefited from decades of government subsides and investment. The new Energy Dominance Financing authority, which provides loans for grid enhancement, is capped at just $1 billion, a limit other global suppliers do not have. It would cost over $25 billion just to build out the required capacitor film lines, as an example. This does not include transformers, switches, power plants, grid towers and other required equipment.

A new model for innovation

Utilities, industries and the DOE will play an integral leadership role in reshoring America’s grid. No single sector can do this alone, and forward-thinking utilities are already breaking the mold. Dominion Energy is investing in fusion, Tennessee Valley Authority and Type One Energy have partnered to develop a commercial fusion power plant, Georgia Power has added two units to the Vogtle nuclear plant and Meta is partnering with Constellation Energy to drive more energy production through nuclear power.

Instead of waiting for vendors to pitch generic solutions, these utilities are openly sharing their challenges, publishing their R&D roadmaps, and hosting innovation summits for startups and established firms to propose targeted, high-impact solutions. This lowers barriers for new entrants and aligns grid technology innovation with actual utility needs.

The message to American innovators is clear: expand domestic production, prove your worth, and utilities will test, deploy and scale your technologies.

We need more partnerships like these: targeted, transparent and focused on results. Government, industry and utilities should align around shared R&D priorities and rapid deployment, advancing focused policies and incentives. We must level the playing field for American innovators, expand our production capacity, and launch national upskilling initiatives to train the next generation of materials scientists and engineers.

What’s at stake: the US economy and security

Advanced energy materials should be treated as a central pillar in America’s economy and national security, on par with semiconductors and rare earths. Reshoring capacitor film manufacturing alone can reclaim $200 billion annually while securing today’s grid and tomorrow’s fusion revolution.

If we continue outsourcing energy supply chains, we risk national security and forfeit the economic benefits of our energy transition. America will be left scrambling for scraps while our competitors dictate the terms.

It’s not too late. By rebuilding our own foundation now, we can transform vulnerability into strength and make the U.S. the architect of the next energy era.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/oWcymlewXofqOmHjVYk3R1PlcNYDCwDyWVQ4D0Y0F2M/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0yMTY5NDQ4NzE4XzEuanBn.webp,N,,2025-10-14 12:14:19.036115

The Washington Post on the revival of the U.S.-China trade war

The United States and China, inveterate rivals yet inextricably interlinked, are once again barreling into a trade war nobody wants. Tit-for-tat tariffs and export controls, coming after a few months respite, once again threaten to damage the economies of both countries and derail global growth.

China on Thursday blindsided the White House by announcing sweeping new curbs on the export of critical raw earth minerals and magnets, needed in everything from laptops and electric vehicles to U.S. military fighter jets, submarines and missiles. Beijing added five new elements to the seven already subject to stringent export controls.

President Donald Trump responded Friday by announcing new 100 percent tariffs on Chinese goods, as well as new export controls on critical technology destined for China. Trump also threatened to scuttle a planned meeting later this month with Chinese President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of an Asian leaders meeting in South Korea. That sit-down was supposed to lay the groundwork for a full-scale summit early next year.

Both sides left time for an off-ramp. China delayed the start of its new restrictions until Dec. 1. Trump delayed the imposition of his retaliatory measures until Nov. 1. This raises the possibility that the world’s two largest economies are mainly staking out hardline negotiating positions, with threats and ultimatums, to improve their bargaining positions.

Longer term, however, the past 48 hours point toward a looming era of increasing friction as the superpowers shift from competition with occasional cooperation to clashes and outright conflict.

China controls about 70 percent of the world’s rare earth mining and 90 percent of the global processing. It was entirely foreseeable that they would use this market power as a pressure point when Trump picked a fight with Xi earlier this year.

At the same time, China has its own pain points. The United States dominates in semiconductors and chip-design software that China cannot yet manufacture domestically and needs to compete in the artificial intelligence boom. The United States also remains the world’s largest consumer market and accounts for about 15 percent of their exports.

China’s willingness to play the rare earths card has pushed the United States to look elsewhere for alternative sources, something that America should have started doing decades ago. Despite the name, rare earths are actually not all that rare, but they are currently most easily and cheaply mined in China.

The United States has vast deposits of rare earths but significantly trails China and Brazil, partly because of deindustrialization but also because mining certain materials tends to create politically untenable levels of environmental damage. As a result, Trump has been looking to strike minerals deals with countries such as Ukraine, the Democratic Republic of Congo and possibly even Myanmar or Venezuela — all of which are embroiled in conflict but have significant assets below ground.

Even more frustrating than needing access to Chinese minerals to keep the economy going is America’s dependence on them processing and transforming its own minerals into finished products. The United States now exports 95 percent of its rare earths to China for processing because it costs so much less than doing it here. Trying to increase domestic processing capacity could take a decade or more, and permitting remains too cumbersome and slow.

Before the blowup at the end of this week, the two sides had been making conciliatory gestures on trade and seemingly trying to dial down the rhetoric ahead of the heads of state meeting. Trump nixed a $400 million lethal arms package to Taiwan, the self-governing democracy which China considers a renegade province. Trump also lifted a ban on selling AI chips to China. Beijing, in turn, toughened controls on two of the precursor chemicals used in the production of fentanyl, one of Trump’s demands. China also gave the preliminary okay for an American consortium to take 80 percent ownership of TikTok.

The bonhomie after summer trade talks in Geneva and London belied the reality that the United States and China are locked in a herculean struggle for influence and military superiority in the Asia-Pacific region that will define the 21st century. Escalating tensions have led some to speak fancifully of decoupling or delinking of the two economies.

The hard truth is that, for the foreseeable future, the United States and China remain mutually dependent. A trade war is in neither country’s interest. Since a divorce is unrealistic, at least anytime soon, it’s better Washington and Beijing go back to talking.

The New York Times says you should blame Trump when your energy bill goes up

You do not have to care about climate change to believe that clean energy is an important and strategic resource. Solar and wind power are now cheaper than coal in many places and sometimes cheaper than oil and gas. Clean energy sources help both hold down costs for Americans and prevent the United States from having to import so much foreign oil from countries hostile to our interests.

These advantages help explain why the right energy policy for the United States is an all-of-the-above strategy. The country should continue using fossil fuels like natural gas while shifting toward cleaner energy that does less damage to the planet. The combination can help Americans struggling with slow-growing incomes while also addressing climate change.

President Trump, however, has rejected the all-of-the-above approach in his second term. He is instead waging a war on solar and wind power. It is a mirror image of the strategy that conservatives criticize the fringes of the environmental movement for favoring. Rather than trying to put oil companies out of business, Mr. Trump is going after clean energy, and Americans will face higher bills as a result.

Mr. Trump signed a law in July that repealed the clean energy tax credits enacted by former President Joe Biden, eliminating hundreds of billions of dollars of investment into wind, solar and electric vehicles. Mr. Trump has also directed his administration to enact new regulations on clean energy and start specious investigations into its use, including one looking into bird deaths caused by wind turbines. His administration is trying to cancel wind projects off the coasts of Massachusetts, Maryland and Rhode Island, which would provide enough electricity to power more than a million homes. “Windmills, we’re just not going to allow them,” Mr. Trump recently said. Even some oil executives have criticized these moves as shortsighted.

Mr. Trump ran for president promising to reduce the cost of living and of energy prices in particular. He has failed so far. Inflation remains near 3 percent a year even as economic growth and job growth have slowed. Electricity prices are almost 10 percent higher than they were a year earlier, according to the most recent numbers. The main reasons for the electricity price surge have little to do with Mr. Trump and instead involve demand from A.I. data centers and supply constraints from the war in Ukraine. Yet the Trump energy policies are not helping — and will soon make matters worse.

Energy prices are likely to rise the most in states that have not prioritized clean energy, including Kentucky, Missouri and Oklahoma, experts say. The repeal of the tax credits alone may push electricity prices almost 10 percent higher than they would be otherwise by 2029, according to National Economic Research Associates, a consulting firm. Gas prices will also increase over the next decade, according to Rhodium Group, a think tank, as consumers who would otherwise have driven electric cars continue using vehicles that burn fossil fuels.

Mr. Trump’s approach to wind and solar is part of a larger story. It is, along with his tariffs, extreme immigration policies and attempt to take over the Federal Reserve, one more example of prioritizing ideology over the interests of American families.

Mr. Trump’s energy policy also weakens America’s global standing by giving a competitive edge to the country’s chief geopolitical rival, China. For years China has meticulously grown its clean energy industry with government subsidies and other policies. Chinese companies now produce 60 percent of the world’s wind turbines and 80 percent of solar panels.

Mr. Biden’s clean energy tax credits were meant to counter China’s moves. He understood that wind and solar would play an important role in the economy of the future, and that the United States should not let China control the global market. Mr. Biden’s approach was working, creating incentives for the private sector to build big clean-energy projects, including Toyota’s E.V. battery production facility in Liberty, N.C., and a Qcells solar panel manufacturing facility in Cartersville, Ga.

Low energy prices are also good for economic growth. If prices are higher here than in other countries, companies will invest less in America. Consider artificial intelligence: Technology companies are building data centers to power their bots’ processing abilities. These data centers use a lot of electricity. If energy supply cannot keep up with demand, America’s A.I. build-out will lag — again to the benefit of China.

The Trump administration argues that wind and solar are not reliable, and that has some truth to it. If the wind is not blowing or the sun is not shining, power cannot be generated. But this objection is mostly a canard. Advances in battery technology will allow the country to use wind and solar energy during off-hours. Wind and solar also do not have to generate electricity at all times. We have other forms of energy — nuclear, hydro, geothermal and, yes, fossil fuels — to handle the moments that wind and solar cannot. When a country is pursuing an all-of-the-above strategy, varying sources of energy complement one another. They increase overall supply and hold down prices for everybody.

We understand why the political right has sometimes been frustrated by the left’s skepticism of energy abundance. In both Europe and the United States, environmentalists who are rightly worried about the costs and dangers of climate change have at times imagined that the transition could happen more quickly than is realistic. In truth, oil and gas will be necessary to keep prices low and power the economy for years to come. But the political left is not the problem today. The Democratic Party under Mr. Biden expanded domestic oil and gas production while making major investments in clean energy.

The Republican Party has long denied the severe risks that climate change presents and stood in the way of sensible policies to address the extreme storms, flooding and heat that are already happening. Under Mr. Trump, Republicans have gone even further. They have become the party that stands in the way of lower energy prices for American households.

The Wall Street Journal on SCOTUS and racial gerrymandering

Here we go again. The Supreme Court keeps getting dragged into redistricting fights involving race, and this week the Justices will rehear a racial gerrymander challenge to Louisiana’s Congressional map. It could be a landmark that ends the cynical use of race by both major parties to advance their partisan interests.

In recent years, the Justices have considered challenges to maps in Texas, South Carolina, Alabama and Louisiana. They punted last term on deciding the Louisiana case (Louisiana v. Callais) that they will reconsider Wednesday. They will also take up the question of whether the intentional creation of majority-minority districts violates the Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause and the Fifteenth Amendment’s prohibition against abridging a citizen’s right to vote based on race. The right answer is yes.

State Legislatures are caught in a legal vise. If they draw maps that consider race too little, they can be found to violate Section 2 of the 1965 Voting Rights Act. If they weigh race too much, they could run afoul of the Constitution’s Equal Protection Clause.

Liberal groups sued Louisiana after Republicans redrew the state Congressional map following the 2020 Census. The map included one majority-minority district, but the plaintiffs said Section 2 requires a second. They reasoned that because blacks make up 30% of Louisiana’s voting-age population, two of the state’s six districts should be majority black.

Section 2 bars voting practices that discriminate based on race. It also guarantees that minorities have an equal opportunity “to participate in the political process and to elect representatives of their choice.” Congress’s aim was to prevent minorities from being disenfranchised by the likes of poll taxes.

The law’s text doesn’t mention majority-minority districts and stresses that it doesn’t establish a right to proportional representation. But the Supreme Court’s muddled Gingles precedent (1986) read into the law a requirement to draw majority-minority districts on two conditions: when minority populations are large, compact and politically cohesive, and when the majority votes “sufficiently as a bloc” to defeat a minority’s “preferred candidate.”

Courts and legislatures have struggled to divine what this means. Must a minority group’s “preferred candidate” be of the same race? How should courts determine if a minority population is “politically cohesive”? In the Louisiana case, the district court ruled for the plaintiffs and ordered the Legislature to draw a second majority-minority district.

Republicans then drew a 250-mile majority-minority district that snakes from the state’s northwest to Baton Rouge. The district isn’t compact and is barely contiguous. Non-black voters then challenged the new map as a violation of the Equal Protection Clause. A lower court agreed, saying the second district violated Gingles.

In the Court’s recent Allen v. Milligan decision (2023), Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh joined the three liberals in requiring a second majority-minority district in Alabama because the minority population was compact. The other four Justices wrote in dissent that the majority misapplied Gingles and contended that courts should “apply a race-neutral benchmark” in deciding whether maps violate Section 2.

Yet Justice Kavanaugh emphasized in a concurring opinion that “the authority to conduct race-based redistricting cannot extend indefinitely into the future.” This echoed the Court’s SFFA v. Harvard decision striking down racial preferences in college admissions. Map-making now may be the only field in which government sorting by race remains legal.

The Court began to slide shut the door to racial gerrymandering in its landmark Shelby County (2013) decision, which struck down the Voting Rights Act’s Section 4 pre-clearance formula. The Court held that the formula was an anachronism from the Jim Crow era and didn’t account for racial progress. The same is true of the Gingles interpretation of Section 2.

As Louisiana argues, “race-based redistricting rests on an invidious stereotype: that all minorities, by virtue of their membership in their racial class, think alike and share the same interests and voting preferences.”

Justice Clarence Thomas has been making this argument for years in eloquent dissents, and he wrote last term that the Court’s “Janus-like election-law jurisprudence” has created an “intractable conflict between this Court’s interpretation” of Section 2 and the Equal Protection Clause. The result is that “states do not know how to draw maps that ‘survive both constitutional and VRA review.’”

Consider Texas, which was sued by the Biden Justice Department for not drawing enough majority-minority districts. With that case pending in the courts, the Trump Justice Department threatened a legal challenge claiming several districts were “unconstitutional racial gerrymanders.” Texas Republicans this summer used the Trump threat as an excuse to redraw the districts to increase their partisan advantage. Now they are being sued again under Section 2.

The Justices would do the country and themselves a favor by correcting the Gingles error and declaring that the Constitution forbids race-based map-making. As the Chief wrote in a 2006 redistricting opinion, “it is a sordid business, this divvying us up by race.”

The Guardian says the relief is real, but will Palestinian suffering end?

The reprieve brought by the end of fighting in Gaza is immense. In Israel, the release of the living hostages has led to widespread elation. In Gaza and the West Bank there are also celebrations, as up to 2,000 Palestinian detainees start to be released – though there is distress, too, due to uncertainty about who is being freed and where they will be sent. In northern Gaza, people can finally return to dig through rubble for the remains of an estimated 10,000 missing people.

As recently as three weeks ago, the likelihood of a ceasefire appeared remote. But it has taken effect, and on Monday Donald Trump travelled from Jerusalem, where he was cheered in the Knesset, to Sharm el-Sheikh in Egypt. There, he joined a high-powered peace summit of more than 20 world leaders, including Sir Keir Starmer. The plan for peace begun there is due to be continued at a conference in the UK. The US president, acting with international partners, did make this deal happen – despite, not because of, Israel’s prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

Hopes that the deal marks the first step toward Palestinian statehood are understandable – but, given historical precedent, somewhat optimistic. It offers no clear path to sovereignty for Palestinians and risks splitting, for the foreseeable future, Gaza from the West Bank. Then there is the utter devastation this war leaves behind. The lack of any timeline for Palestinian self-determination in Mr Trump’s plan gives the lie to vainglorious references, in his Knesset speech, to the “historic dawn” of a “golden age”.

The US president could not help himself polarising and personalising the deal in his speech. In a moment of relief – with the hostage release, ceasefire and resumption of aid – he chose to recast it as a morality play in which he alone restored Israel’s honour after supposed betrayal by former US presidents Obama and Biden. This despite the Biden administration a year ago having attempted a similar deal: a ceasefire tied to humanitarian access and eventual political talks.

A plan that denies one side meaningful agency cannot yield legitimate peace. The ceasefire and aid trucks are to be welcomed. But this is not yet political progress. Without mechanisms guaranteeing Palestinian participation and control over their own institutions, any deal risks freezing subjugation under the language of peace.

Gaza’s people desperately need humanitarian aid – and food and medicines must be the first priority. But reconstruction cannot wait. Amid 60m tonnes of rubble, Palestinians need help restoring homes, schools, hospitals, mosques and other institutions shattered by Israel’s invasion. For Gaza’s transitional administration to succeed, funding must flow quickly and security gaps be filled. Like much of Mr Trump’s peace plan, references to an international stabilisation force and a proposed “board of peace”, with Sir Tony Blair, are alarmingly vague.

Strong international support for the Palestinian Authority, enabling it to take over from Hamas, is probably the most promising possibility. The enormous suffering of the past two years means the moral case for a resolution to the conflict is arguably more urgent than ever. But while the ceasefire, the return of the hostages and commitment by Hamas to “demilitarise” Gaza should be acknowledged as positive steps, Mr Trump’s record gives little reason to believe he will deliver – or feel bound to try. Short-term relief does not mean that the prospect of a Palestinian state has been brought closer.

The St. Louis Post-Dispatch on Trump’s crackdowns on student visas

“When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best. They’re sending people that have lots of problems. They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.”

So declared Donald Trump in 2015, kicking off a presidential campaign rooted in hatred, fear and xenophobic myth — though at least tempered by the “good people” afterthought.

But 10 years later, it turns out “good people” from around the world aren’t welcomed in Trump’s America, either. Even foreign college students here legally and on their own dime to study in America’s great universities — the very definition of the “best of the best” — are getting the signal loud and clear that this president doesn’t want them here.

In St. Louis, as around the nation, colleges and universities have seen their enrollment of foreign students here on student visas plummet this year. Some of it’s due to stricter student visa requirements the administration is imposing for no good reason. Others are choosing not to come here out of concern about whether they will be allowed to stay and work after graduation — a concern exacerbated by the administration’s new $100,000 H-1B work visa fee on American employers who want to hire foreign workers in specialty occupations.

Still others, presumably, are repelled by the toxic and increasingly brazen anti-immigrant rhetoric from the MAGA movement and its expanding campaign to rid America of anyone not born here.

That campaign is especially self-destructive when it comes to supporting American higher education. Unlike most American-born college students, foreign students who study here generally are paying top tuition rates, a financial lifeline for institutions that have struggled with diminishing public funding and declining enrollment by American-born students.

As the Post-Dispatch’s Monica Obradovic reports, a survey of four St. Louis-area universities found a drop in international enrollment of more than 2,700 students this year compared to last. St. Louis University alone has dropped by more than 1,500 international students. Washington University in St. Louis is down almost 1,000 foreign students. Southern Illinois University-Edwardsville is down 15%.

It’s part of a national trend that has dire implications for America’s economy. The NAFSA Association of International Educators estimates that foreign students contribute close to $44 billion to the economy annually, including supporting more than 378,000 jobs here. The New York Times reported this month that nearly 20% fewer international students arrived in the U.S. for the start of the current school year in August compared to last year. That’s the largest one-year drop on record except for the 2020 pandemic year.

Some of the administration’s student visa revocations have been in response to foreign students engaging in peaceful protest against U.S. policy regarding Gaza and other controversies. That’s a shameful statement to the world about how little our current president values our own First Amendment.

But most of the decline in international students is due to stricter student visa restrictions, travel bans from specific countries — and students simply (and understandably) declining to come here because of the current xenophobic political climate fueled by this administration. A spokesperson for Webster University in St. Louis County, for example, told the Post-Dispatch’s Obradovic that the private school has seen international enrollment fall at its three domestic campuses in favor of its seven foreign campuses.

The issue is bigger than money. International students tend to be the best and the brightest from their countries. A 2022 report from the National Foundation for American Policy found that fully one in four billion-dollar American startups have founders or co-founders who initially came here as international students. George Mason University reported in 2024 that almost one-third of Nobel laureates affiliated with American academic institutions were born somewhere else.

In terms of both economic and intellectual benefit to the U.S., these are exactly the “good people” Trump alluded to a decade ago. Yet under his current regime, they’re being expelled, barred or just convinced to stay away in record numbers. We’re all the poorer for it.

,American Energy,2025-10-14 15:32:33+00:00,Science,Inside the colossal quest for limitless energy from nuclear fusion | National Geographic,"Michael Finkel, Paolo Verzone",,,,,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/stars-nuclear-fusion-energy,"Fusion fills the bill of energy savior, except that it’s difficult to begin the reaction and harder to maintain it.
Fusion energy currently sits at the maddening intersection of conceptual simplicity and technological perplexity.
Some fusion experts have concluded, across several decades now, that controlling fusion is beyond the limits of human capability.
Since these particles are affected by magnetic forces, the jar confining ITER’s plasma will be formed of electromagnetic fields.
ITER, striving to distribute knowledge rather than produce commercial energy, is like the public library of fusion.","Real stars, the ones in space, are simple beasts. Our sun formed some 4.6 billion years ago from a cloud consisting of essentially one ingredient: hydrogen, the most basic and abundant element in the universe. Gravity kneaded the cloud into a big, rotating ball and kept squeezing from there, density and warmth spiking, until its core reached about 27 million degrees Fahrenheit.

Hydrogen crumbles when collisions occur at this temperature and pressure, creating the soupy jumble of atomic parts known as plasma, the fourth state of matter after solid, liquid, and gas. Though rare on Earth outside of lightning bolts and neon signs, plasma accounts for over 99 percent of the solar system’s mass, most of it stored, highly agitated, in the sun. Throughout the sun’s soup, trillions of times every instant, four hydrogen atoms lock together in a series of steps to make helium. With a much higher fusion point, helium bobs placidly amid the solar havoc, a sturdy lifeboat, not even breaking a sweat at 27 million degrees—and there’s enough hydrogen in the sun to keep forging helium for another five billion years.

One further process takes place in each of these nuclear fusion reactions. A helium atom is just a speck lighter than four hydrogen atoms, and the leftover bits of matter, unleashed and energetic, thrash through the plasma, shimmy gradually to the sun’s surface, and stream into space. Those headed in the right direction deliver morsels of heat and light to Earth.

Here’s how mighty our sun is: The total energy it produces each second would power the entire Earth, gluttonously, for hundreds of thousands of years. And the process by which a star does this seems tantalizingly easy. What if we could create a smaller sun here on Earth and tap into its power? Then, theoretically, we’d have a virtually unlimited source of clean and cheap energy, emitting no carbon dioxide, potentially halting global warming and environmental collapse. The world would literally be saved. It sounds improbable, but such an endeavor has long been under way at a vast construction site in the south of France, where both the hard science and the need for human collaboration are unprecedented and unpredictable, and the dream of a better future can be witnessed coming to life.

The artificial star is called ITER (pronounced “eater”), the Latin word for “the way” and an acronym for the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor. The 100-acre work area, pancake flat, is an hour’s drive inland from the Mediterranean Sea, tucked amid pine forests and vineyards, with craggy hills on the horizon.

Each weekday, more than 2,000 people, physicists to welders, arrive at the site. Smaller crews toil at night. Thirty-three nations representing half the world’s population are official ITER members, and workers from 90 countries have been involved in its creation—a web of cultures knitting a singular machine. In the middle of the jobsite, dominating the view, a windowless cement edifice rises like a volcano.

To enter this structure, you must visit the attached dressing room and swap your footwear for white clean-room shoes, then use the electric shoe scrubber to ensure that any dirt or contaminants are gone, and march in place on a sticky mat to eliminate gunk on the soles. The machine being built needs to be kept fastidiously pristine. A dropped pen cap or stray fingerprint could cause damage. You also have to wear a white lab coat, a hairnet, a hard hat, protective eyewear, and white gloves.

LIMITED TIME OFFER

Once properly dressed, you pass through a plastic strip curtain and unzip a canvas flap, like a tent door, and zip it shut behind you. Then walk down a narrow corridor, fluorescently lit, the walls, floor, and ceiling all the same bright white as your shoes. The air is still and stifling.

At the end of the hallway, unzip and rezip another door, navigate a second white corridor, climb up a layer of scaffolding jungle-gym style, and duck through one more zippered portal. There’s a claustrophobic sense of being lost in a labyrinth. Traverse yet another dizzying white hallway and open a further door and there you are, inside the great machine room.

A lot of the metal is burnished to a brilliant shine, many pieces plated in silver, an ideal material for deflecting heat from sensitive components. Pipes run here and there in parallel rows like raked sand in Zen gardens, wending through the works. The heart of the machine is in the form of a giant sphere, with a doughnut-shaped hollow where plasma may one day whirl. The device is called a tokamak. There are few sharp edges on a tokamak, and massive segments of ITER’s machinery are sculpted with graceful, sandstone-like curves.

ITER is publicly funded, billions of dollars shouldered by dozens of governments, with no profit motive or military aim. “We are contributing to world peace,” says Kijung Jung, head of the project’s South Korean unit, expressing an admirable objective that is somewhat belied by decades of international disputes. The project is open source; if ITER operates as planned, any nation or private company can access its intellectual property, free of charge. This is not going to happen soon. The quest for a mechanical star has been unfolding for a century, and still has years to go.

But in a world that can feel quick-tempered and fractious, ITER appears to be a crazily ambitious long-term project rooted in optimism and a desire for unity. The endeavor has already extended across careers and lifetimes, with each step forward seemingly offset by unanticipated setbacks. “It will be a savior for future generations,” promises Dutch physicist Akko Maas, a 25-year veteran of ITER, speaking from his office overlooking the teeming construction area. A few scientists have observed that ITER may be our era’s version of the Egyptian pyramids or the Gothic cathedrals of Europe. Some visitors permitted to see the machine have been moved to tears, for it can seem a miracle that ITER exists at all.

Other observers, including some of the most powerful voices in science, have not been swayed by ITER’s charms. Three separate Nobel Prize winners in physics—Pierre-Gilles de Gennes of France, his countryman Georges Charpak, and Masatoshi Koshiba of Japan—independently declared that attempts to create a miniature sun to help power the Earth are a waste of money and effort, doomed to fizzle out, and possibly dangerous.

Despite such criticism, an ITER-like facility, if completed and hooked to the energy grid, would presumably be safer, cleaner, and more productive than any nuclear power plant now in use. All of the world’s 400-plus nuclear reactors operating across some 30 nations rely on fission. Fusion and fission are similar-looking words based on the same concept of creating energy from excess matter in atomic reactions, but otherwise they’re opposites. In a fusion plant, lightweight atoms—hydrogen has just one electron, one proton, and zero, one, or two neutrons—are forced together. With fission, heavier elements such as uranium or plutonium, each with a total of more than 300 electrons, protons, and neutrons, are split apart.

The great advantage of fission is that reactions are easy to start. One good jolt and particles drop from the big atoms like fruit from a tree. But fission is messy—some of the radioactive waste will be toxic to humans for tens of thousands of years. Fusion, too, produces hazardous radioactive by-products, but nothing remotely comparable. Also, fissile material like uranium may be depleted within a century, while the type of hydrogen best suited for fusion is almost endlessly abundant in seawater.

There’s also fission’s limited but unavoidable record of catastrophe: Three Mile Island, Pennsylvania, in 1979; Chernobyl, Ukraine (then part of the U.S.S.R.), in 1986; Fukushima, Japan, in 2011. Fission reactions, without careful control, can become explosive, prone to gallop off uncontrollably. With fusion, runaway reactions and meltdowns aren’t possible. In a fusion plant, any accident or system failure, or even a small instability in the plasma, immediately causes the reaction to lose strength and extinguish itself.

Also, fusion produces four times as much energy as fission with the same quantity of fuel. And fusion is about four million times more energetic, and vastly cleaner, than chemical reactions that burn oil or coal. Renewable energy sources including solar, wind, and geothermal are, like nuclear power, largely carbon free, but none of them appear capable of scaling up to meet global demand.

Fusion fills the bill of energy savior, except that it’s difficult to begin the reaction and harder to maintain it. Atoms naturally repel one another, and enormous forces are required to slam them together and fuse them. Even then, plasma is skittish and fragile, constantly seeking to dissipate. The largest detonation of all time, the big bang, could maintain fusion for only three minutes before it faded away. For the next hundred million years, fusion didn’t exist in the universe, until gravity muscled enough hydrogen together for the first stars to ignite. Virtually every lab experiment involving fusion has consumed more energy than it has produced, contrary to the goal of a power plant.

Fusion energy currently sits at the maddening intersection of conceptual simplicity and technological perplexity. Some fusion experts have concluded, across several decades now, that controlling fusion is beyond the limits of human capability.

Daniel Jassby, who worked at the Princeton Plasma Physics Lab for 25 years, wrote after his retirement that a fusion plant would be too convoluted, requiring endless maintenance, and “cause more problems than it would solve.” The late Lawrence Lidsky, an associate director of MIT’s fusion center and founding editor of the Journal of Fusion Energy, declared after a long career that fusion power is a fantasy, noting that it’s widely regarded as “the hardest scientific and technical problem ever tackled.” Walter Marshall, former chairman of the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority, reportedly said that “fusion is an idea with infinite possibility and zero chance of success.”

There’s no shortage of scientists who support ITER—Stephen Hawking once said that fusion was the single idea with the greatest potential to advance humanity—but the project’s detractors mostly articulate the same idea: ITER’s complexity can seem absurd.

The more you know about the machine, the less it may appear to make sense. “This is high risk, high reward,” says Kathryn McCarthy, director of the United States’ ITER bureau. The idea is undeniably a long shot, possibly a wild-goose chase, that might in fact exceed human capacity. But for many who’ve dedicated their working lives to ITER, it’s precisely this uncertainty and absurdity that make the effort alluring. How can we know our limits unless we try our hardest to exceed them?

Achief absurdity is the heat. Of the three fusion requirements, plasma confinement, pressure, and heat, humans are most limited by pressure. A million Earths could fit inside the sun, and this size difference is insurmountable—the center of the sun is 13 times denser than lead. There’s no known way we can create a squeeze like that on our planet.

To make up for this, a lot of heat is needed. The main source of ITER’s heat comes from a pair of giant laserlike particle guns called neutral beam injectors. Each gun is the size of two city buses parked end to end; their barrels point into the tokamak. They will fire one-million-volt particle beams continuously for an hour. To power the guns and other components, ITER has built a 10-acre electrical switchyard capable of drawing as much energy from the French national grid as a city of one million people, though the machine, once operational, should prove that this debt can be repaid at least tenfold.

When the guns open fire, hydrogen gas in the tokamak will swirl through the doughnut, increasing in velocity as the temperature rises—one million degrees Fahrenheit, two million, 10 million. The atoms will move faster than the speed of sound, then swifter still, as the heat exceeds the 27 million degrees at the center of the sun, then passes 50 million, 100 million, 200 million. The force of accelerating particles in the tokamak will equal that of two space shuttles launching at once. Only at 270 million degrees, 10 times the temperature of the sun’s core, will hydrogen atoms in ITER collide and shed electrons, then fuse together as helium.

How do you contain something so hot? No known material could do it. A tokamak made of pure diamonds would vaporize instantly. But here the nature of plasma is helpful—the stew of atomic parts includes a large number of positively charged protons and negatively charged electrons. Since these particles are affected by magnetic forces, the jar confining ITER’s plasma will be formed of electromagnetic fields.

Like many ideas being implemented at ITER, the development of the electromagnetic system draws on the most promising discoveries from years of research at laboratories worldwide that have nothing to do with nuclear fusion. The magnets at ITER, also absurd, start with the central solenoid, which will fill the hole of the doughnut. It’s like a grain silo six stories high, and will become the backbone of the world’s most powerful magnetic system, generating forces that could lift an aircraft carrier out of the water. Circling the machine like Hula-Hoops will be six immense poloidal magnets, and hanging vertically will be 18 D-shaped toroidal magnets, each over 50 feet tall, enclosing the plasma’s loop. Together the magnets will weigh more than 11,000 tons, and they must be machined with extraordinary precision, the margin for error less than the thickness of a sheet of paper. “To create this,” says one ITER worker, “you have to be a little crazy.”

These are all superconducting magnets, which means that they can carry strong electrical currents without resistance, allowing the intense fields required to corral ITER’s plasma. For superconductivity to work, these magnets must be kept extremely cold. ITER has also built a cryoplant big enough to house a soccer field—“the most complicated refrigerator in the world,” as an ITER cryogenic engineer put it—that will circulate liquid helium through the magnets.

ITER’s magnets need to be cooled to negative 450 degrees Fahrenheit. This is just a few ticks above absolute zero, the point at which atomic energy has reached its minimum, nearly motionless state. Perhaps the ultimate absurdity of ITER is that it will contain one of the hottest known places in the universe and one of the coldest, little more than a body’s length apart. “We are playing with Mother Nature’s forces,” says Alberto Loarte, director of ITER’s science division, jotting down a page of mathematical calculations showing just how great these forces are. “I can’t predict the difficulties we will face. We may learn that we understand nothing.”

Here’s how it’s supposed to work: The doughnut-shaped area in the tokamak will be pumped clear, forming a vacuum—any stray molecules can pollute the plasma. The magnets will be supercooled and activated, then hydrogen gas will be injected into the vacuum chamber at about half a gram per second. This gas will be heavier than common hydrogen. ITER’s recipe calls for a combination of deuterium, which adds one neutron to the normally neutronless atom, and tritium, which adds two.

Without these isotopes, the tokamak would have to be heated hundreds of millions of degrees higher, yet this efficiency also brings complications. Deuterium, though rare, can be plucked out of seawater; our oceans contain a many-million-year global supply. But tritium doesn’t naturally occur, and is slightly radioactive, so ITER will also be testing first-of-a-kind components that, it’s hoped, will permit the machine to safely breed its own tritium.

Once the neutral beam injectors have zapped the gas to the necessary 270 million degrees, the resulting plasma will glow faintly red, like an aurora—the northern and southern lights are also plasmas—and, says an ITER physicist, emit a sound like the screech of an alley cat. Newly fused helium atoms will drop out of the plasma, a sort of ash, and collect in a huge dish known as the divertor at the bottom of the tokamak.

Heavy hydrogen will continually be added, keeping the plasma fed. Another benefit of using deuterium and tritium is that about half of the fusion reaction’s by-products are neutrons. Neutrons, well named, are neutral, unaffected by magnetism. Loose neutrons will fly through the plasma in all directions and crash against the walls of the tokamak, striking what’s called the blanket.

ITER’s blanket, not soft, is formed from hunks of tungsten, steel, aluminum, and bronze, designed to absorb this hailstorm of neutrons, hundreds of trillions per second, and transfer the heat of the particles’ kinetic energy from inside the tokamak to outside. In an actual fusion power plant, this heat could be used to boil water, creating steam, which can spin turbines and generate electricity.

More than a hundred years of effort and money have already been devoted to achieving these minutes. Painted across the lobby of the five-story ITER headquarters building, home to administrative offices and scientific think tanks, is a timeline of fusion milestones. It begins in 1919, when French physicist Jean Perrin hypothesized that stars produce energy through fusion. This was definitively proved in the 1930s, and soon after the power of fusion was grasped, scientists set about trying to kill people with it.

The bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945 used only fission. After World War II, the global arms race escalated, and the U.S. initiated a project to weaponize fusion. On November 1, 1952, the first hydrogen bomb, Ivy Mike—a two-stage explosive using fission and fusion—completely eliminated one of the Marshall Islands in the Pacific, a blast equal to 700 Hiroshimas. This was just the start, as scientists swiftly realized that fission-fusion hybrid bombs could be boosted exponentially. The threat of destroying the planet with a single weapon was real.

Global powers attempted to change that trajectory. In 1953, U.S. president Dwight Eisenhower delivered what is known as the Atoms for Peace address at the United Nations in New York City, in which he called on “the entire body of the world’s scientists and engineers” to abandon the military use of atomic reactions and instead adapt their studies “to the arts of peace.”

Most scientists focused on fission, but a handful of researchers, regarded by some mainstream academics at the time as mavericks or dreamers or con artists, realized that fusion was the ultimate, world-changing prize, and set about trying to utilize it. The first generation of fusion machines, incorporating mirrors or lasers or electric currents, all ended in miserable failure. Some simply didn’t work or were exposed as frauds, while others formed plasma that lasted a fraction of a second before collapsing.

Plasma, physicists learned, was a fiendish substance. Containing it has been compared to wrapping jelly in rubber bands. Volatilities in plasma—events that snuff the reaction—were given descriptive names: kink instability, sausage instability, bump-in-tail. The list totals more than 50. By the time of the Second United Nations International Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy, held in Geneva, Switzerland, in 1958, world leaders generally agreed that all nations’ nuclear energy research should be declassified and shared. The Soviet Union, concurring, disclosed a breakthrough that was later given the name tokamak, a shortening of the Russian phrase “toroidal chamber with magnetic coil.”

The tokamak was an elegant design that could achieve hotter plasmas and longer confinement times than anything before. No fusion device had ever been more promising, and scientists calculated that bigger tokamaks would provide the volume needed to maintain plasma in a stable and energetic state. By the late 1970s, three separate giant tokamaks were in development: in Princeton, New Jersey; Oxfordshire, England; and Naka, Japan. Hundreds of millions of dollars were spent on each one, and optimism surged. But years passed in which none of these new machines came close to proving that fusion was economically feasible. Fusion, observers like to say, is 20 years away—and always will be.

At a juncture when fusion could’ve easily been abandoned, it was unexpectedly revived. In 1985, Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and U.S. president Ronald Reagan held a summit in Geneva, their first ever meeting. The agreement they reached included a declaration that the two nations, and any other countries willing to join them, would work together to build a fusion reactor “for the benefit of all mankind.” And thus from the endgame of the Cold War was born ITER.

Bickering and infighting commenced immediately. ITER is inhuman in scope—hot, cold, immense, subatomic—yet can also seem like the most human thing ever, bloated by geopolitics, red tape, and hubris. Two dozen European countries and Japan promptly joined the alliance, and with no nation holding majority control, haggling began over ITER’s technical design and cost. The squabbling dragged on for years, through the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991—Russia remained with ITER—and bureaucratically onward into 1998, when the U.S., having spent $345 million on what some officials felt was basically nothing, quit the project.

The battle over where to build the machine consumed more years of politicking, ultimately coming down to France or Japan. A compromise was reached, and it was decided that there would be a Japanese director general and a French worksite. Ground was broken in January 2007, a mere 21 years after the Gorbachev and Reagan accord in Geneva.

Seven more years of preparatory work ensued—clearing and leveling the site, then creating an elaborate foundation fitted with shock absorbers to protect the machine from potential earthquakes. Just over a decade ago, in 2014, construction finally began on the monumental tokamak housing, the centerpiece of the 39 buildings and technical areas sprawled across ITER’s campus. Specialists in dozens of fields, plasma physics to electromagnetics to cement pouring, were recruited and hired. The ITER site has its own bus system, plying the paved perimeter roads, while dirt lanes in the middle are a cacophony of forklifts, dump trucks, and backhoes, with teams of hard-hatted workers marching around on foot. In late 2018, the first of the machine’s 10 million pieces was put into place.

These pieces are being manufactured by member nations across the globe, then shipped to the worksite in France. The chief contribution of the U.S. is the central solenoid, the megamagnet, which is being built by General Atomics, a family-owned business in San Diego. Russia is contributing additional magnets and superconducting materials. Europe is creating some of the main tokamak hardware, and South Korea the rest. India is supplying cooling system apparatuses; Japan is fashioning heating structures. About 5,000 companies worldwide have been involved in the effort.

Some parts made abroad are the size of a basketball court and weigh more than a passenger jet. Many are heavily wrapped and encased in a protective frame before being loaded onto a cargo ship. From Asian countries, the trip to France takes more than a month. The package is then balanced on a barge and floated up a canal and across a lake. The last 65 miles are on roads, which were reinforced and widened, permitting a 352-wheeled transport platform to creep at three miles an hour all night for three or four nights to arrive at ITER.

How much will all of this cost? It’s hard to know exactly, as there is no official global accounting. The ITER agreement signed in 2006 claimed that the entire project, including the value of items made by members, would cost around six billion dollars, start to finish. That price has ballooned to $65 billion, more than 10 times the original estimate, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. (ITER disputes that figure.) If it alters the course of civilization, fusion supporters say, it’ll be seen as a bargain—even the new figure represents less than three days of current global expenditures on energy—but ITER will be, by far, the most expensive scientific instrument on Earth.

Many of ITER’s delays and cost overruns have been self-inflicted—an internal assessment of ITER’s management practices detailed pricey design changes and administrative gridlock—but some have been beyond the project’s control: storms at sea, pirates in the Suez Canal. The 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan interrupted parts production there for a year. The COVID pandemic slowed the world for two more. Yet through everything ITER churned inexorably on.

Then came an extraordinary accomplishment. ITER may be the world’s largest jigsaw puzzle, but the most essential construction, the tokamak and attached components, has been reduced to nine massive pieces, called vacuum vessel modules. These will fit together like segments of an orange. Each weighs about 1,500 tons. To move one, ITER had to invent several new lifting machines. Workers rehearsed the sequence of events that needed to happen. And on May 12, 2022, the first module, made of parts supplied by almost every ITER member, was tucked perfectly into its spot.

The milestone, decades in the making, was a celebrated ITER triumph. Now that one module was in place, the other eight would surely follow. After all the hurdles, the machine was going to get built, and switched on. There was light at the end of the tunnel.

And then the project nearly self-destructed.

ITER is entirely dependent on funding from federal governments, which can be fickle sources of money. Politicians like to hear about success and momentum, even when the reality is, according to the internal ITER report, that management is blundering and the engineering challenges are more formidable than anticipated. Some cheerleading by the project’s leadership is expected—in 2015, the U.S. was reportedly considering a second ITER exit, and in order to stay, needed to be convinced that progress was coming. But what happened at ITER is that showmanship seemed to have eclipsed honesty, and in a project of exacting, revolutionary science, this was bound to bring disaster.

The placement of the vacuum vessel module in 2022 generated glowing news reports from major trade publications. The job, however, was apparently done in a corner-cutting rush. Inspections revealed tiny cracks and pinhole leaks. The tokamak was compromised. The module couldn’t be repaired where it was, wedged tight, and the installation couldn’t be reversed without partially tearing the machine apart. Workers didn’t know what to do, and construction of the tokamak ground to a halt.

At the very moment ITER needed decisive leadership, there was none. Two days after the module was hung, the director general of ITER, Bernard Bigot, died of an illness at age 72. Bigot, a French physicist, was ITER’s third chief, following two Japanese directors, Kaname Ikeda and Osamu Motojima. All three executives seemed to succumb, at least somewhat, to the organizational malaise known as “big project syndrome.” A warehouse at ITER is filled with parts that nobody knows who ordered or why. The head of communications before Bigot’s tenure, Michel Claessens, later admitted that ITER’s public statements often contained “lies, propaganda, and misinformation,” creating an atmosphere that resulted in the reckless installation of the vacuum vessel module.

An Italian electrical engineer named Pietro Barabaschi, who has a long history in fusion, was appointed by the project’s governing body, the ITER Council, to take over. Approachable, energetic, informal—he often comes to work in jeans and running shoes, and everyone calls him Pietro—he seems comfortable amid chaos. He’s 59 years old, lanky and tall, and speaks fluent Italian, English, and German, as well as workable French. Taming fusion, says Pietro, is like humans learning to harness fire for the second time in history. Being burned by mistakes is inevitable, and he publicly pledged that ITER would be transparent about them, and even published an article in the science journal Nature Reviews Physics titled “The Importance of Documenting Failure.” Pietro’s first major decision as director was that the vacuum vessel module would be removed, at enormous expense and multiple years of holdup. Either the project would be done right, he implied, or it wouldn’t be done at all.

The sentiment among ITER workers seemed to be that Pietro clearly made the right choice, and might have just killed the project. “I thought that was it, the end of ITER,” says communications officer Sabina Griffith, who has worked at the site for almost two decades. Lola Zedet, an ITER construction coordinator, said that the news of the module’s removal was both understandable and shocking. After the insane scramble to get the vacuum vessel module in place, the world had been turned upside down. “Shifts of people were looking at each other and doing nothing,” says Zedet. “It was almost surreal.” But after some time and mental recalibration, she says, the crews returned to work, and the unbuilding of ITER began.

Many fusion experts believe that success is more probable from a nimble private company motivated by profit than from an overstuffed public project like ITER. There are currently more than a hundred private fusion initiatives worldwide battling for a potentially epic grand prize of an energy fortune.

ITER’s avuncular stance is that there isn’t competition at all—the true dream is fusion energy for the globe, and the more places attempting it, the better the chance it will happen. Private firms are welcome to visit the site, to study what’s worked and what hasn’t, and to tap into a fount of hard-earned wisdom. ITER, striving to distribute knowledge rather than produce commercial energy, is like the public library of fusion. Also, ITER shares the results of its extensive diagnostics and testing on parts and materials, allowing others to save time and money, and push on. It appears unlikely that any private firm will make the public effort obsolete.

From the outside, it seemed like ITER was going backward right through to the end of 2024, each day further from completion, the machine dismantled, the vacuum vessel module pulled out and then itself disassembled, then tests to determine the course of repairs. But on the vast campus, the culture had shifted toward progress. In Pietro’s view, so many elements of the project were pioneering, entering the realm of the unknown, that ITER was like a scientific Lewis and Clark. They’d gotten lost for a while in the wilderness, but had reorganized and streamlined the management structure, and soon would be navigating smoothly again. For every problem that may be encountered, Pietro believes, there exists a reasonable solution. Government funding during this reset did not dry up.

In April 2025, just shy of three years since the vacuum vessel module had first been installed, it was put in again and the project was back to zero. Two months later, the second segment was mounted. The remaining seven are all in various stages of completion. The jobsite is buzzing, welding sparks flying from the construction zones, cranes swinging through the sky, physicists scribbling on whiteboards.

Pietro, putting in 12-hour days, bounces from meeting to meeting, often taking a total of six minutes for lunch, enough to wolf down a sandwich or salad. “It’s both a sprint and a marathon,” he says of ITER, “with surprises around every corner.” But no matter how crammed his schedule, Pietro tries to observe two traditions. A couple of times a week, he puts on a hard hat and protective gear and goes alone to observe the tokamak construction, climbing up the scaffolding to get to his favorite spot, at the very top, with a bird’s-eye view of the machine, all of the ambition and folly and genius of it. He just takes it in for a while, the sound of hammering echoing continuously, a metallic smell in the air. Then gets back to work.

The other tradition is his first meeting of the morning, usually at six o’clock, in the distinctly unfancy office of the head of construction, Sergio Orlandi, a longtime colleague of Pietro’s and a fellow Italian. Orlandi is 69 years old and has worked on nuclear projects for 45 years. As the sun rises over the southern French hills outside Orlandi’s window, they have coffee and discuss the plans for the day. Pietro calls this his moment of calm, but before he’s halfway through his coffee, you can see his energy building, his left foot tapping, clicking his retractable pen, faster and faster, until the visit is done and he’s out the door.",https://i.natgeofe.com/n/b52a5c65-e75f-4648-b826-8dbabc2a7005/MM9893_04262022-03081_16x9.jpg?w=1200,N,,2025-10-14 14:03:35.536630

Mission over emissions For more than 25 years, the U.S. military planned for climate change.
“The @DeptofDefense does not do climate change crap,” he wrote in a March posting on X.","Retired Marine Corps gunnery sergeant Vida Rivera knows heat can be as dangerous as any enemy.

Early in her military career, she collapsed from heat exhaustion while carrying a 65-pound pack on a sweltering hike in Quantico, Virginia. Years later in Afghanistan, Rivera drove a truck in temperatures nearing 120 degrees. But she was ready. She’d taken a mechanics course — twice — to make sure she could fix the truck’s air conditioning if it failed.

She knew extreme heat could incapacitate her Marines. “They need water and good temps like everybody,” she said.

Across the U.S. military, climate change isn’t a distant threat. It’s a daily challenge. The fallout from a warming planet has hit the military hard, sidelining more than 10,000 troops since 2018, flooding bases and undermining everything from runways to nuclear readiness.

Extreme weather is battering installations from Guam to North Carolina and fueling instability in regions overseas where American forces may be called to intervene.

For decades, the Pentagon viewed climate change as a national security threat — not for environmental reasons, but because it undermined operations and readiness.

Now the Trump administration is dismantling that approach. Pentagon leaders have cut climate research funding and abandoned adaptation plans. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has dismissed global warming concerns as “climate change crap.”

Critics warn that the military is being forced to fly blind — and that the cost could be strategic vulnerability in a world where climate is increasingly shaping conflict.

“I think it puts our troops at risk,” said Erin Sikorsky, director of the Center for Climate and Security. “… We’re going to be less prepared if our troops are deployed somewhere where it’s incredibly hot and their equipment doesn’t work right, or if they themselves can’t physically operate … That’s malpractice, I think.”

The Defense Department did not respond to Floodlight’s requests for public documents and an interview to discuss changes to its climate policy.

The Pentagon’s 2026 budget request recommends cutting $1.6 billion in “wasteful” climate spending. Among the targeted programs: a $6 million grant to decarbonize emissions from Navy ships. Where most of the remaining cuts would come from is unclear.

That marked a sharp break from the previous administration, when the Department of Defense sought $5 billion for climate initiatives in its fiscal 2024 budget — including efforts to harden bases against extreme weather and reduce battlefield fuel dependence.

How warming undermines U.S. military power

In September 2018, Hurricane Florence dumped 36 inches of rain on Camp Lejeune in North Carolina, creating a 13-foot storm surge and damaging more than 3,000 homes at the Marine Corps base and nearby air stations.

Just a month later, Hurricane Michael struck Tyndall Air Force Base in Florida with 160 mph winds, flipping fighter jets and damaging more than 600 buildings. The branch spent nearly $5 billion to repair and upgrade the base to become more resilient to future storms.

And in May 2023, Typhoon Mawar slammed Andersen Air Force base in Guam with 140 mph winds and 28 inches of rain. The storm upended cars, took out power lines and damaged nearly 500 buildings. It cost nearly $10 billion to repair and to harden the base against future extreme weather events.

According to the National Weather Service, unusually warm ocean temperatures supercharged all three storms.

These aren’t isolated events. Rising seas are projected to cause chronic flooding at coastal military bases in the coming decades. By 2050, half of coastal bases could each face 270 or more flood events each year, according to a study by the Union of Concerned Scientists.

Major storms can hobble nuclear deterrence, too. Hurricanes could damage submarines or delay the transport of nuclear warheads, warned researcher Jamie Kwong, a fellow in the Nuclear Policy Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. All three nuclear delivery systems — air, land and water — could be hampered by climate change, she said.

Training and lives at risk

Since 2022, the U.S. military has been deployed to more than 230 climate emergencies, according to the nonprofit Center for Climate and Security.

Much of that work has fallen to the National Guard. Over the past decade, the National Guard put in nearly 4 million days of service responding to hurricanes, floods, wildfires and other disasters, the Pentagon said in a recent report to four Democratic U.S. senators who had requested the information.

And heat-related illnesses among troops are climbing. From 2020 to 2024, the annual rate of heat exhaustion among service members jumped 52%. In 2024 alone, troops suffered more than 2,800 heat-related illnesses.

Fort Benning has long had a problem with excessive heat. Stretching across 182,000 hot and muggy acres in west-central Georgia straddling the Alabama state line, it’s one of the Army’s top training centers — and it has recorded more heat-related illnesses than any other U.S. military base. Until about a decade ago, someone there was dying from the heat every three years.

That crisis led to the 2019 creation of the U.S. Army’s Heat Center at Fort Benning, where military personnel are taught how to prevent and treat heat-related illnesses.

Officers there developed techniques like arm immersion — lowering soldiers’ arms into cold water during training breaks to reduce body temperature — and ice sheeting, where frozen bed sheets are wrapped around overheated troops to bring down body heat quickly.

To reduce the risk of heat illnesses, the military generally suspends nonessential outdoor activities on extremely hot days. One such instance occurred in August, when a heat wave gripping the Korean Peninsula forced U.S. and South Korean forces to postpone half of their field training exercises.

These so-called “black flag” days— generally 90 degrees Fahrenheit or above — are becoming more common at many military bases, according to a 2023 Defense Department report.

As global temperatures rise, the military may have to suspend summer training at its hottest bases and “spend a heck of a lot of money” to relocate that training, predicts Caroline Baxter, a former deputy assistant secretary of defense for education and training under the Biden administration.

It’s not just troops who suffer. Military planes and ships are affected, too. Hot, humid air is less dense, which means planes struggle to generate the lift they need and can’t carry as much cargo. In fact, a 2019 Climate and Security brief warns that hotter, more humid air will force military aircraft to reduce payloads — or abandon missions entirely.

During the 2016 raid to capture Osama bin Laden, one of the Black Hawk helicopters sustained severe damage during a hard landing. President Barack Obama emphasized the impact that the hot temperature had on the incident.

Warm seawater, meanwhile, makes it harder to cool ship engines, while melting glaciers dilute ocean salinity, which can compromise the effectiveness of sonar.

As the world warms, it’s bringing more droughts and food shortages to fragile areas, contributing to problems that threaten national security interests, the U.S. Army said in its 2022 climate strategy document.

Retired Army Lt. Gen. Russel Honoré, who led the military response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005, noted that drought caused by global warming helped trigger the 2011 Syrian civil war and the later armed conflict in Sudan. He has since founded the Green Army, an organization that fights toxic pollution in Louisiana.

“You can change your policy to not consider the impact of global warming on your strategic posture,” Honoré said, “but … the heat will cause a disruption to global stability as well as security. And it will continue to have a human impact on our day-to-day training and operational readiness.”

Melting Arctic ice also increases the potential for military conflict, experts say, because it’s opening up shipping lanes that were once inaccessible. Contested economic and military activities between Russia and other Arctic nations “will increase the risk of miscalculation,” a 2023 threat assessment by the U.S. Intelligence Community warned.

“What that really means is there is an accident waiting to happen,” according to “Threat Multiplier,” a book by Sherri Goodman, who as deputy undersecretary of defense led the military’s environmental efforts during the Clinton administration.

Mission over emissions

For more than 25 years, the U.S. military planned for climate change.

The Department of Defense developed its first climate change strategy in 1998 and a decade later declared global warming a national security issue. After Joe Biden took office, the military’s focus on climate impacts took on new urgency.

“Climate change is an existential threat to our nation’s security,” then-Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said in 2021, “and the Department of Defense must act swiftly and boldly to take on this challenge and prepare for damage that cannot be avoided.”

For the Pentagon, climate change wasn’t just about the environment — it was about how and where troops could operate.

“How do I continue to do my job despite the fact that the operational environment is changing?” said John Conger, a former high-ranking Defense Department official who later ran the Center for Climate and Security. “ …You’re not thinking about emissions, you’re thinking about missions.”

In 2022, the U.S. Army began rolling out its first hybrid tactical vehicles. There was a practical reason for that, too: Hybrids are quieter and consume less fuel, which can save lives in combat.

“We were losing marines and soldiers in the constant movement of fuel to the front in Afghanistan and Iraq,” Goodman wrote in her book. “For every 24 fuel convoys in Afghanistan, one soldier was killed.”

Some Pentagon projects aimed at boosting effectiveness and efficiency have also spun off climate-friendly civilian innovations. For example, the military’s work with General Motors on hydrogen fuel cells produced fast-charging, off-grid power units that could speed electric car charging.

New doctrine: Climate doesn’t matter anymore

President Donald Trump has pushed to rechristen the Department of Defense as the “Department of War.” And Hegseth has made it clear that the Pentagon’s priorities have shifted.

“The @DeptofDefense does not do climate change crap,” he wrote in a March posting on X. “We do training and warfighting.”

On March 17, Hegseth issued a memo banning Pentagon agencies from spending money on climate planning and ordering leaders to “remove all references to climate change and related subjects from mission statements.”

Hegseth doubled down on his message in his Sept. 30 address to hundreds of military leaders at Quantico, declaring there would be “no more climate change worship” in the U.S. military.

The secretary’s March directive does leave room for the continuation of some weather-related work, including risk assessments, environmental reviews and base resilience improvements.

But the Pentagon also announced it’s canceling 91 studies focused on climate and social science research. The move will save $30 million — a tiny fraction of the department’s $850 billion budget. That research was designed to help military planners anticipate emerging security threats, including climate change, extremism and disinformation.

‘We’re not going to be ready’

Cutting those grants is short-sighted, says Tom Ellison, deputy director of the Center for Climate and Security. His group, working with Virginia Tech, was slated to get $2 million to study how rising seas and extreme weather could fuel instability in the Philippines, Guam and Japan — regions important to U.S. strategy in the Indo-Pacific. But in March, they learned the grant was canceled.

“These research projects answer key questions about not just climate change, but a variety of issues shaping the world in which the US military operates, including migration, technology, ideology, public opinion, etc.” Ellison wrote in an email to Floodlight.

“Moreover,” he added, “they do it for relative pennies,” noting the Pentagon spends $30 million “roughly every 20 minutes.”

Climate action plans from the Army, Navy, Air Force and Coast Guard have quietly disappeared from public websites in recent months. The Pentagon also shut down its climate resilience portal.

Baxter, the former deputy assistant defense secretary, helped build that portal, which she called a vital hub for validated climate data.

Said Conger, the former Center for Climate and Security director: “If you do not have complete information because you willfully ignore certain parts of the puzzle, you put yourself at a disadvantage — because the Russians and the Chinese aren’t ignoring it.”

Sikorsky, the center’s current director, agreed.

“It sends a message to our competitors and adversaries … ‘We’re going to be weak because we’re not going to be ready.’”

The Washington Post on the revival of the U.S.-China trade war

The United States and China, inveterate rivals yet inextricably interlinked, are once again barreling into a trade war nobody wants. Tit-for-tat tariffs and export controls, coming after a few months respite, once again threaten to damage the economies of both countries and derail global growth.

China on Thursday blindsided the White House by announcing sweeping new curbs on the export of critical raw earth minerals and magnets, needed in everything from laptops and electric vehicles to U.S. military fighter jets, submarines and missiles. Beijing added five new elements to the seven already subject to stringent export controls.

President Donald Trump responded Friday by announcing new 100 percent tariffs on Chinese goods, as well as new export controls on critical technology destined for China. Trump also threatened to scuttle a planned meeting later this month with Chinese President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of an Asian leaders meeting in South Korea. That sit-down was supposed to lay the groundwork for a full-scale summit early next year.

Both sides left time for an off-ramp. China delayed the start of its new restrictions until Dec. 1. Trump delayed the imposition of his retaliatory measures until Nov. 1. This raises the possibility that the world’s two largest economies are mainly staking out hardline negotiating positions, with threats and ultimatums, to improve their bargaining positions.

Longer term, however, the past 48 hours point toward a looming era of increasing friction as the superpowers shift from competition with occasional cooperation to clashes and outright conflict.

China controls about 70 percent of the world’s rare earth mining and 90 percent of the global processing. It was entirely foreseeable that they would use this market power as a pressure point when Trump picked a fight with Xi earlier this year.

At the same time, China has its own pain points. The United States dominates in semiconductors and chip-design software that China cannot yet manufacture domestically and needs to compete in the artificial intelligence boom. The United States also remains the world’s largest consumer market and accounts for about 15 percent of their exports.

China’s willingness to play the rare earths card has pushed the United States to look elsewhere for alternative sources, something that America should have started doing decades ago. Despite the name, rare earths are actually not all that rare, but they are currently most easily and cheaply mined in China.

The United States has vast deposits of rare earths but significantly trails China and Brazil, partly because of deindustrialization but also because mining certain materials tends to create politically untenable levels of environmental damage. As a result, Trump has been looking to strike minerals deals with countries such as Ukraine, the Democratic Republic of Congo and possibly even Myanmar or Venezuela — all of which are embroiled in conflict but have significant assets below ground.

Even more frustrating than needing access to Chinese minerals to keep the economy going is America’s dependence on them processing and transforming its own minerals into finished products. The United States now exports 95 percent of its rare earths to China for processing because it costs so much less than doing it here. Trying to increase domestic processing capacity could take a decade or more, and permitting remains too cumbersome and slow.

Before the blowup at the end of this week, the two sides had been making conciliatory gestures on trade and seemingly trying to dial down the rhetoric ahead of the heads of state meeting. Trump nixed a $400 million lethal arms package to Taiwan, the self-governing democracy which China considers a renegade province. Trump also lifted a ban on selling AI chips to China. Beijing, in turn, toughened controls on two of the precursor chemicals used in the production of fentanyl, one of Trump’s demands. China also gave the preliminary okay for an American consortium to take 80 percent ownership of TikTok.

The bonhomie after summer trade talks in Geneva and London belied the reality that the United States and China are locked in a herculean struggle for influence and military superiority in the Asia-Pacific region that will define the 21st century. Escalating tensions have led some to speak fancifully of decoupling or delinking of the two economies.

The hard truth is that, for the foreseeable future, the United States and China remain mutually dependent. A trade war is in neither country’s interest. Since a divorce is unrealistic, at least anytime soon, it’s better Washington and Beijing go back to talking.

The New York Times says you should blame Trump when your energy bill goes up

You do not have to care about climate change to believe that clean energy is an important and strategic resource. Solar and wind power are now cheaper than coal in many places and sometimes cheaper than oil and gas. Clean energy sources help both hold down costs for Americans and prevent the United States from having to import so much foreign oil from countries hostile to our interests.

These advantages help explain why the right energy policy for the United States is an all-of-the-above strategy. The country should continue using fossil fuels like natural gas while shifting toward cleaner energy that does less damage to the planet. The combination can help Americans struggling with slow-growing incomes while also addressing climate change.

President Trump, however, has rejected the all-of-the-above approach in his second term. He is instead waging a war on solar and wind power. It is a mirror image of the strategy that conservatives criticize the fringes of the environmental movement for favoring. Rather than trying to put oil companies out of business, Mr. Trump is going after clean energy, and Americans will face higher bills as a result.

Mr. Trump signed a law in July that repealed the clean energy tax credits enacted by former President Joe Biden, eliminating hundreds of billions of dollars of investment into wind, solar and electric vehicles. Mr. Trump has also directed his administration to enact new regulations on clean energy and start specious investigations into its use, including one looking into bird deaths caused by wind turbines. His administration is trying to cancel wind projects off the coasts of Massachusetts, Maryland and Rhode Island, which would provide enough electricity to power more than a million homes. “Windmills, we’re just not going to allow them,” Mr. Trump recently said. Even some oil executives have criticized these moves as shortsighted.

Mr. Trump ran for president promising to reduce the cost of living and of energy prices in particular. He has failed so far. Inflation remains near 3 percent a year even as economic growth and job growth have slowed. Electricity prices are almost 10 percent higher than they were a year earlier, according to the most recent numbers. The main reasons for the electricity price surge have little to do with Mr. Trump and instead involve demand from A.I. data centers and supply constraints from the war in Ukraine. Yet the Trump energy policies are not helping — and will soon make matters worse.

Energy prices are likely to rise the most in states that have not prioritized clean energy, including Kentucky, Missouri and Oklahoma, experts say. The repeal of the tax credits alone may push electricity prices almost 10 percent higher than they would be otherwise by 2029, according to National Economic Research Associates, a consulting firm. Gas prices will also increase over the next decade, according to Rhodium Group, a think tank, as consumers who would otherwise have driven electric cars continue using vehicles that burn fossil fuels.

Mr. Trump’s approach to wind and solar is part of a larger story. It is, along with his tariffs, extreme immigration policies and attempt to take over the Federal Reserve, one more example of prioritizing ideology over the interests of American families.

Mr. Trump’s energy policy also weakens America’s global standing by giving a competitive edge to the country’s chief geopolitical rival, China. For years China has meticulously grown its clean energy industry with government subsidies and other policies. Chinese companies now produce 60 percent of the world’s wind turbines and 80 percent of solar panels.

Mr. Biden’s clean energy tax credits were meant to counter China’s moves. He understood that wind and solar would play an important role in the economy of the future, and that the United States should not let China control the global market. Mr. Biden’s approach was working, creating incentives for the private sector to build big clean-energy projects, including Toyota’s E.V. battery production facility in Liberty, N.C., and a Qcells solar panel manufacturing facility in Cartersville, Ga.

Low energy prices are also good for economic growth. If prices are higher here than in other countries, companies will invest less in America. Consider artificial intelligence: Technology companies are building data centers to power their bots’ processing abilities. These data centers use a lot of electricity. If energy supply cannot keep up with demand, America’s A.I. build-out will lag — again to the benefit of China.

The Trump administration argues that wind and solar are not reliable, and that has some truth to it. If the wind is not blowing or the sun is not shining, power cannot be generated. But this objection is mostly a canard. Advances in battery technology will allow the country to use wind and solar energy during off-hours. Wind and solar also do not have to generate electricity at all times. We have other forms of energy — nuclear, hydro, geothermal and, yes, fossil fuels — to handle the moments that wind and solar cannot. When a country is pursuing an all-of-the-above strategy, varying sources of energy complement one another. They increase overall supply and hold down prices for everybody.

We understand why the political right has sometimes been frustrated by the left’s skepticism of energy abundance. In both Europe and the United States, environmentalists who are rightly worried about the costs and dangers of climate change have at times imagined that the transition could happen more quickly than is realistic. In truth, oil and gas will be necessary to keep prices low and power the economy for years to come. But the political left is not the problem today. The Democratic Party under Mr. Biden expanded domestic oil and gas production while making major investments in clean energy.

The Republican Party has long denied the severe risks that climate change presents and stood in the way of sensible policies to address the extreme storms, flooding and heat that are already happening. Under Mr. Trump, Republicans have gone even further. They have become the party that stands in the way of lower energy prices for American households.

The Wall Street Journal on SCOTUS and racial gerrymandering

Here we go again. The Supreme Court keeps getting dragged into redistricting fights involving race, and this week the Justices will rehear a racial gerrymander challenge to Louisiana’s Congressional map. It could be a landmark that ends the cynical use of race by both major parties to advance their partisan interests.

In recent years, the Justices have considered challenges to maps in Texas, South Carolina, Alabama and Louisiana. They punted last term on deciding the Louisiana case (Louisiana v. Callais) that they will reconsider Wednesday. They will also take up the question of whether the intentional creation of majority-minority districts violates the Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause and the Fifteenth Amendment’s prohibition against abridging a citizen’s right to vote based on race. The right answer is yes.

State Legislatures are caught in a legal vise. If they draw maps that consider race too little, they can be found to violate Section 2 of the 1965 Voting Rights Act. If they weigh race too much, they could run afoul of the Constitution’s Equal Protection Clause.

Liberal groups sued Louisiana after Republicans redrew the state Congressional map following the 2020 Census. The map included one majority-minority district, but the plaintiffs said Section 2 requires a second. They reasoned that because blacks make up 30% of Louisiana’s voting-age population, two of the state’s six districts should be majority black.

Section 2 bars voting practices that discriminate based on race. It also guarantees that minorities have an equal opportunity “to participate in the political process and to elect representatives of their choice.” Congress’s aim was to prevent minorities from being disenfranchised by the likes of poll taxes.

The law’s text doesn’t mention majority-minority districts and stresses that it doesn’t establish a right to proportional representation. But the Supreme Court’s muddled Gingles precedent (1986) read into the law a requirement to draw majority-minority districts on two conditions: when minority populations are large, compact and politically cohesive, and when the majority votes “sufficiently as a bloc” to defeat a minority’s “preferred candidate.”

Courts and legislatures have struggled to divine what this means. Must a minority group’s “preferred candidate” be of the same race? How should courts determine if a minority population is “politically cohesive”? In the Louisiana case, the district court ruled for the plaintiffs and ordered the Legislature to draw a second majority-minority district.

Republicans then drew a 250-mile majority-minority district that snakes from the state’s northwest to Baton Rouge. The district isn’t compact and is barely contiguous. Non-black voters then challenged the new map as a violation of the Equal Protection Clause. A lower court agreed, saying the second district violated Gingles.

In the Court’s recent Allen v. Milligan decision (2023), Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh joined the three liberals in requiring a second majority-minority district in Alabama because the minority population was compact. The other four Justices wrote in dissent that the majority misapplied Gingles and contended that courts should “apply a race-neutral benchmark” in deciding whether maps violate Section 2.

Yet Justice Kavanaugh emphasized in a concurring opinion that “the authority to conduct race-based redistricting cannot extend indefinitely into the future.” This echoed the Court’s SFFA v. Harvard decision striking down racial preferences in college admissions. Map-making now may be the only field in which government sorting by race remains legal.

The Court began to slide shut the door to racial gerrymandering in its landmark Shelby County (2013) decision, which struck down the Voting Rights Act’s Section 4 pre-clearance formula. The Court held that the formula was an anachronism from the Jim Crow era and didn’t account for racial progress. The same is true of the Gingles interpretation of Section 2.

As Louisiana argues, “race-based redistricting rests on an invidious stereotype: that all minorities, by virtue of their membership in their racial class, think alike and share the same interests and voting preferences.”

Justice Clarence Thomas has been making this argument for years in eloquent dissents, and he wrote last term that the Court’s “Janus-like election-law jurisprudence” has created an “intractable conflict between this Court’s interpretation” of Section 2 and the Equal Protection Clause. The result is that “states do not know how to draw maps that ‘survive both constitutional and VRA review.’”

Consider Texas, which was sued by the Biden Justice Department for not drawing enough majority-minority districts. With that case pending in the courts, the Trump Justice Department threatened a legal challenge claiming several districts were “unconstitutional racial gerrymanders.” Texas Republicans this summer used the Trump threat as an excuse to redraw the districts to increase their partisan advantage. Now they are being sued again under Section 2.

The Justices would do the country and themselves a favor by correcting the Gingles error and declaring that the Constitution forbids race-based map-making. As the Chief wrote in a 2006 redistricting opinion, “it is a sordid business, this divvying us up by race.”

The Guardian says the relief is real, but will Palestinian suffering end?

The reprieve brought by the end of fighting in Gaza is immense. In Israel, the release of the living hostages has led to widespread elation. In Gaza and the West Bank there are also celebrations, as up to 2,000 Palestinian detainees start to be released – though there is distress, too, due to uncertainty about who is being freed and where they will be sent. In northern Gaza, people can finally return to dig through rubble for the remains of an estimated 10,000 missing people.

As recently as three weeks ago, the likelihood of a ceasefire appeared remote. But it has taken effect, and on Monday Donald Trump travelled from Jerusalem, where he was cheered in the Knesset, to Sharm el-Sheikh in Egypt. There, he joined a high-powered peace summit of more than 20 world leaders, including Sir Keir Starmer. The plan for peace begun there is due to be continued at a conference in the UK. The US president, acting with international partners, did make this deal happen – despite, not because of, Israel’s prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

Hopes that the deal marks the first step toward Palestinian statehood are understandable – but, given historical precedent, somewhat optimistic. It offers no clear path to sovereignty for Palestinians and risks splitting, for the foreseeable future, Gaza from the West Bank. Then there is the utter devastation this war leaves behind. The lack of any timeline for Palestinian self-determination in Mr Trump’s plan gives the lie to vainglorious references, in his Knesset speech, to the “historic dawn” of a “golden age”.

The US president could not help himself polarising and personalising the deal in his speech. In a moment of relief – with the hostage release, ceasefire and resumption of aid – he chose to recast it as a morality play in which he alone restored Israel’s honour after supposed betrayal by former US presidents Obama and Biden. This despite the Biden administration a year ago having attempted a similar deal: a ceasefire tied to humanitarian access and eventual political talks.

A plan that denies one side meaningful agency cannot yield legitimate peace. The ceasefire and aid trucks are to be welcomed. But this is not yet political progress. Without mechanisms guaranteeing Palestinian participation and control over their own institutions, any deal risks freezing subjugation under the language of peace.

Gaza’s people desperately need humanitarian aid – and food and medicines must be the first priority. But reconstruction cannot wait. Amid 60m tonnes of rubble, Palestinians need help restoring homes, schools, hospitals, mosques and other institutions shattered by Israel’s invasion. For Gaza’s transitional administration to succeed, funding must flow quickly and security gaps be filled. Like much of Mr Trump’s peace plan, references to an international stabilisation force and a proposed “board of peace”, with Sir Tony Blair, are alarmingly vague.

Strong international support for the Palestinian Authority, enabling it to take over from Hamas, is probably the most promising possibility. The enormous suffering of the past two years means the moral case for a resolution to the conflict is arguably more urgent than ever. But while the ceasefire, the return of the hostages and commitment by Hamas to “demilitarise” Gaza should be acknowledged as positive steps, Mr Trump’s record gives little reason to believe he will deliver – or feel bound to try. Short-term relief does not mean that the prospect of a Palestinian state has been brought closer.

The St. Louis Post-Dispatch on Trump's crackdowns on student visas

“When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best. They’re sending people that have lots of problems. They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.”

So declared Donald Trump in 2015, kicking off a presidential campaign rooted in hatred, fear and xenophobic myth — though at least tempered by the “good people” afterthought.

But 10 years later, it turns out “good people” from around the world aren’t welcomed in Trump’s America, either. Even foreign college students here legally and on their own dime to study in America’s great universities — the very definition of the “best of the best” — are getting the signal loud and clear that this president doesn’t want them here.

In St. Louis, as around the nation, colleges and universities have seen their enrollment of foreign students here on student visas plummet this year. Some of it’s due to stricter student visa requirements the administration is imposing for no good reason. Others are choosing not to come here out of concern about whether they will be allowed to stay and work after graduation — a concern exacerbated by the administration’s new $100,000 H-1B work visa fee on American employers who want to hire foreign workers in specialty occupations.

Still others, presumably, are repelled by the toxic and increasingly brazen anti-immigrant rhetoric from the MAGA movement and its expanding campaign to rid America of anyone not born here.

That campaign is especially self-destructive when it comes to supporting American higher education. Unlike most American-born college students, foreign students who study here generally are paying top tuition rates, a financial lifeline for institutions that have struggled with diminishing public funding and declining enrollment by American-born students.

As the Post-Dispatch’s Monica Obradovic reports, a survey of four St. Louis-area universities found a drop in international enrollment of more than 2,700 students this year compared to last. St. Louis University alone has dropped by more than 1,500 international students. Washington University in St. Louis is down almost 1,000 foreign students. Southern Illinois University-Edwardsville is down 15%.

It’s part of a national trend that has dire implications for America’s economy. The NAFSA Association of International Educators estimates that foreign students contribute close to $44 billion to the economy annually, including supporting more than 378,000 jobs here. The New York Times reported this month that nearly 20% fewer international students arrived in the U.S. for the start of the current school year in August compared to last year. That’s the largest one-year drop on record except for the 2020 pandemic year.

Some of the administration’s student visa revocations have been in response to foreign students engaging in peaceful protest against U.S. policy regarding Gaza and other controversies. That’s a shameful statement to the world about how little our current president values our own First Amendment.

But most of the decline in international students is due to stricter student visa restrictions, travel bans from specific countries — and students simply (and understandably) declining to come here because of the current xenophobic political climate fueled by this administration. A spokesperson for Webster University in St. Louis County, for example, told the Post-Dispatch’s Obradovic that the private school has seen international enrollment fall at its three domestic campuses in favor of its seven foreign campuses.

The issue is bigger than money. International students tend to be the best and the brightest from their countries. A 2022 report from the National Foundation for American Policy found that fully one in four billion-dollar American startups have founders or co-founders who initially came here as international students. George Mason University reported in 2024 that almost one-third of Nobel laureates affiliated with American academic institutions were born somewhere else.

In terms of both economic and intellectual benefit to the U.S., these are exactly the “good people” Trump alluded to a decade ago. Yet under his current regime, they’re being expelled, barred or just convinced to stay away in record numbers. We’re all the poorer for it.

“Climate change is a tremendous stress on the economy,” she said.

There is increasing evidence that climate change is already having devastating impacts on the US economy.","The US administration’s pushback on climate issues and firing of climate experts under President Donald Trump has given investors mixed signals and could impact the broader economy due to a lack of data and regulatory insight, experts have told Green Central Banking.

“It’s easier to make an ideologically driven decision, to ignore the problem as it’s growing and manifesting, if you don’t have the expertise in the room,” said Alex Martin, policy director of climate finance at Americans for Financial Reform.

Under Trump’s leadership, federal regulators have either limited or paused initiatives around climate change. Most recently, the US Financial Stability Oversight Committee (FSOC) disbanded two committees focused on the impact that climate change could have on the economy and financial stability, which advocates worry could leave regulators without key information for managing risks.

The FSOC has previously recognised the systematic threat of climate change and “choosing to ignore these risks isn’t just petty political posturing; it makes the financial system more fragile by weakening regulators’ ability to monitor and respond to cross-cutting threats that endanger Americans’ financial security,” said Jessye Waxman, campaign advisor at Sierra Club.

Meanwhile, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) paused its climate disclosure rules that would have required publicly traded companies to report their emissions data and has refused to defend its position in court.

Other jurisdictions, including in California and the EU, already require climate disclosure data or will do so soon. In California, for example, nearly 70% of companies that fall under requirements to report supply chain emissions data are headquartered outside the state.

Ripple effects on US economy

As other countries and regulators are working to mitigate climate risk, the administration has criticised climate change, with Trump calling it a “con job”. California’s disclosure rules are being challenged in court, while SEC chairman Paul Atkins recently threatened to ban European accounting rules from the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) if the agency continues to pursue sustainability and climate issues.

European companies are allowed to use standards from the IFRS in lieu of the US’s Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. While the IFRS has established climate standards under the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB), these are separate from its accounting standards and one does not impose requirements on the other, an IFRS foundation spokesperson said.

These actions could have ripple effects across the US economy, said Allison Fajans-Turner, policy lead at the Rainforest Action Network, especially as the Trump administration has rolled back the Inflation Reduction Act.

“Climate change is a tremendous stress on the economy,” she said. Not only from physical impacts, but also from rising energy costs. Trump’s attack on clean energy is ultimately going to hit people’s bottom line and fall on the taxpayer as other countries increase their clean energy manufacturing, Fajans-Turner said.

“The US is ceding clean energy manufacturing to other countries. And this administration said they wanted to bring manufacturing jobs back to the United States. The actions that they’re taking are actually doing the opposite of that. Clean energy was one of the fastest growing sources of jobs, and by starving it of support and resources they’re actually squashing down that job market”.

Mixed signals for banks and investors

Moves such as the FSOC disbandment of climate groups is part of a general trend by the US government to sideline and dismiss experts, said Martin.

Both Trump and his administration have made claims about authoritative institutions and individuals without providing evidence to back them up. Claims by the SEC’s Atkins that the ISSB prevents the IFRS from setting reliable, independent account standards is no different.

“It’s almost like climate denial in a way,” said Martin.

Atkins’ comments ignore increasing calls for climate change impacts to be incorporated into financial statements which ultimately harms investors who aren’t aware of the risks coming from climate change, Martin said.

This has led to less interest in green projects such as renewable energy in the US even as the rest of the world has increased investment by 10%. Businesses are receiving mixed signals on how to comply with jurisdictions and become more sustainable without drawing the ire of the Trump administration which has shown it is “willing to attack businesses [and] individuals, for not participating in [the administration’s] denials of these realities around climate change,” Martin said.

US banks have responded to Trump’s anti-green stance by withdrawing from volunteer climate commitment groups like the Net Zero Banking Alliance, which has subsequently closed down. In addition, some companies have continued their green transition efforts without publicly talking about it, a phenomenon known as greenhushing.

Investors and companies in general want to make the highest return with the lowest risk possible, and investors are increasingly looking beyond the next quarter to the next 50 years, said Steven Rothstein, chief programme officer at climate thinktank Ceres.

“There are many banks and investors that are stepping away from public statements. They are doing the work, but they’re not talking about it,” he said.

There is increasing evidence that climate change is already having devastating impacts on the US economy. Data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration shows that the effect of extreme weather events has increased drastically since the 1980s. Meanwhile, a report from Ceres found that there is more risk on bank balance sheets from physical and transition risk of climate change than there was from the subprime housing crisis.

“Fundamentally, Mother Nature doesn’t know who’s elected president, and the fires and floods continue,” Rothstein said.",https://greencentralbanking.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/US-retreat-from-climate-regulation-could-put-economy-under-stress-experts-say-meta-image.png,N,,2025-10-14 12:11:31.774997

EIG’s Renewable & Energy Transition Moves Even while he warns of risk, EIG is active in the clean energy space.
Fidra Energy: EIG launched this UK/EU battery storage platform.
European Energy & EIG: The two raised €130 million for green energy construction, especially wind and solar, in Europe.
Prosolia Energy: EIG agreed to a €255 million deal to support Prosolia in growing its solar power business across Europe.","Blair Thomas, chairman and CEO of EIG Partners, has made a strong warning about investing in renewable energy today. He said, “I think US renewables are largely un-investable today because of the policy framework.” He went on: “Another I would point to is the UK North Sea. It’s largely uninvestable because of policy decisions by the UK government.”

Why He Says Renewables Face a Risky Future

Thomas’s view is that even though the technology for wind, solar, and battery storage is more advanced than ever, the rules set by governments are too unstable. Investors need certainty. If rules change mid-project, costs rise and profits shrink.

He pointed to two regions:

The United States – where shifting tax incentives, regulation delays, and political opposition make projects risky.

The UK North Sea – where licensing, taxes, and government choices have pushed investors away.

EIG’s Renewable & Energy Transition Moves

Even while he warns of risk, EIG is active in the clean energy space. Their work shows they still see opportunity — but only where policy is stable.

According to EIG’s public reports, the firm has committed over $6.5 billion to energy transition investments globally, including renewable, hydrogen, and battery projects as of 2024.

Here are a few examples of what EIG is doing now:

Aukera: EIG helped arrange a €450 million facility for Aukera to build more than 1.5 GW of solar, wind, and co-located battery projects in Europe by 2026.

Fidra Energy: EIG launched this UK/EU battery storage platform. It plans a 10 GW battery portfolio by 2030, including a major 1.45 GW site in South Yorkshire.

Fidra and Sungrow: They signed a partnership to deploy 4.4 GWh of storage systems in the UK, supporting big battery projects.

Modern Energy & Industrial Sun: EIG invested $90 million to boost large-scale solar plants in the U.S. (Texas region) for industrial clients.

European Energy & EIG: The two raised €130 million for green energy construction, especially wind and solar, in Europe.

Prosolia Energy: EIG agreed to a €255 million deal to support Prosolia in growing its solar power business across Europe.

Policy Instability: The Main Blocker

Thomas’s critique is clear: policy risk is the greatest barrier. Even good technology and strong capital don’t help if rules shift. Investors may lose confidence, and money moves away.

Some key facts:

Energy transition investments are complex and long term; investors often lock money in for 10–20 years.

Governments may change tax incentives, or remove subsidies, or revise rules for licensing and permits.

Projects need stable grid and transmission access. Delays or grid constraints reduce project value.

What Makes a Market “Investable”?

Thomas and many in the field say a market is investable when:

Rules are stable for many years

Permits are predictable and fast

Financing and capital are assured over the project life

Grid access is reliable and cost-effective

Challenges Are Global, Not Just in the U.S.

Thomas did not limit his view to the U.S. He also warned about the UK North Sea, where policy changes, taxation rules, and licenses have driven away investors.

Globally, many countries face similar tension: they want renewable growth, yet they fear locking in bad deals or excessive subsidies. So they hesitate, or keep changing course. That uncertainty scares away big investors.

How EIG’s Own Data Supports His Warning

EIG’s public data supports Thomas’s skepticism about wide investment in renewables. The firm has steadily increased its focus on energy transition. But still, only a portion of its capital goes into clean energy.

Metric Value Total capital committed over lifetime Over $51.3 billion in energy projects worldwide Latest AUM (Assets Under Management) ≈ $23.8 billion as of June 30, 2025 Investment in energy transition (by 2024) $6.5 billion

What Must Change for Renewables to Grow

To make renewable energy truly investable, several reforms are needed. Thomas and analysts broadly agree on these steps:

Long-term policy commitments—plans that last 10–20 years without sudden swings.

Faster permitting processes—clearer steps and faster approvals for projects.

Better grid and transmission build-out—more electricity lines to carry solar and wind power.

Stable tax credits or subsidies—support that does not change midstream.

Public-private partnerships—governments and private firms sharing risk and reward.

Without such changes, Thomas believes many renewable projects will stall. Investment will slow. And that could hamper progress toward climate goals.

Conclusion

Blair Thomas’s strong warning shakes up how we think about clean energy investments. He makes us see that advanced technology alone is not enough.

MISSION, Texas — At a press conference hosted by the Texas International Produce Association (TIPA) on Friday, October 10, 2025, regional leaders, business officials, and lawmakers called for immediate action to address what they described as a mounting crisis of water scarcity in the Rio Grande Valley. The group urged the U.S. government to make Mexico’s compliance with the 1944 Water Treaty enforceable through the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).

The event, held at the TexaSweet Building in Mission, gathered key figures including U.S. Congresswoman Monica De La Cruz, Texas Citrus Mutual President Dale Murden, Elsa Economic Development Corporation Executive Director Daniel Rivera, and Texas International Produce Association President and CEO Dante Galeazzi. Together, they outlined how Mexico’s failure to deliver water as required by treaty obligations has left millions of people, thousands of farmers, and the region’s ecosystem in jeopardy.

“For far too long—80 years—we have been held hostage by the Mexican government, which failed over and over to give us the water that they owed us,” said Congresswoman De La Cruz. “That’s why we lost our sugar cane industry—over 500 jobs and millions of dollars gone. That will not happen under my watch.”

De La Cruz, who represents South Texas in Congress, said her office has worked closely with federal agencies to push Mexico to fulfill its obligations. She noted that over the past year, Mexico has begun delivering overdue water and is expected to provide 420,000 acre-feet by the end of this month. “This is huge,” she said, “but our work does not end there. We need to put teeth on the 1944 Water Treaty.”

According to De La Cruz, the best path forward is to link the treaty to USMCA, the trilateral trade agreement governing commerce among the U.S., Mexico, and Canada. “Currently, under the 1944 Water Treaty, there are no consequences to the Mexican government if they fail to deliver,” she said. “By tying it to the USMCA, we create consequences—real, enforceable measures if they do not comply.”

Dale Murden, who represents more than 400 citrus growers as president of Texas Citrus Mutual, emphasized that the issue extends far beyond agriculture. “Availability affects this region in every way,” Murden said. “Regional growth, the economy, the environment, agriculture, sustainability, and our community’s health all depend on water. The Rio Grande is our lifeline.”

Murden noted that over six million people rely on the river for drinking, sanitation, and public use. He added that repeated shortfalls by Mexico have left Valley cities “scrambling for emergency measures during droughts,” making long-term planning nearly impossible. “Reduced flows lead to dying wetlands, rising salinity, and loss of fish and wildlife habitat,” he said. “Protecting the river’s flow is protecting the Valley’s health, welfare, and future.”

From an economic standpoint, Daniel Rivera of the Elsa Economic Development Corporation described how water shortages are already affecting communities and budgets. “In Elsa, we’re already paying almost three times as much for our water as we were a couple of years ago,” Rivera said. “That strains families and our city operations.”

Rivera said that without reliable water, growth slows, developers hesitate to invest, and confidence in the region’s economic future weakens. “Water is a foundation for every home we build, every business park we design, and every factory we hope to land,” he said. “The 1944 Water Treaty isn’t just an environmental agreement—it’s a trade issue. Water drives production, labor, and infrastructure—the very sectors USMCA was designed to strengthen.”

The agricultural toll has been severe. Dante Galeazzi, president and CEO of the Texas International Produce Association, said farmers have been forced to plant fewer crops for several consecutive years due to water scarcity. “More than 90 percent of our freshwater comes from the Rio Grande,” he said. “If there’s no water in that river, where are we going to get it?”

Galeazzi said farmers planted 30 percent fewer fruits and vegetables this past season—not by choice but by necessity. “It’s the third year in a row they’ve had to tell customers, ‘I’m sorry, I have nothing for you,’” he said. “It’s the third year they’ve had to tell their banks they’ll be short on payments. Some are asking themselves if it’s time to stop farming altogether. That’s not right. That’s not how it should be.”

All four speakers urged the public to participate in the U.S. Trade Representative’s open comment period before November 3, 2025, to support including the 1944 Water Treaty in the USMCA. Comments can be submitted through https://comments.ustr.gov/s/submit-new-comment?docketNumber=USTR-2025-0004

De La Cruz said public pressure is essential to show Washington the Valley’s unity and urgency. “We need the public to step in and make comments,” she said. “This is the time when the Rio Grande Valley can step up into the national light and really highlight the need for this treaty to be in the USMCA agreement.”

When asked what might happen if the effort fails, De La Cruz responded firmly, “I don’t know anything but success. There is no other option but to win here.”

Murden closed the event by reiterating the call for collective action. “We want to encourage public participation in the USTR comment process and highlight the importance of uniting the Valley’s voice on water security and environmental protection,” he said. “No water, no growth, no life. It’s that simple.”

At the conclusion of the event, attendees were provided with informational packets containing background materials and a QR code. The QR code takes readers directly to the U.S. Trade Representative’s comment portal, enabling the public to quickly participate in the feedback process and lend their voice to the campaign for water security in the Rio Grande Valley.

Dive Brief:

Harris County, Texas, sued the Environmental Protection Agency Monday for canceling its Solar for All grant funding. Harris County received one of the largest Solar for All Awards in 2024.

The EPA eliminated the program in August, citing the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, but the lawsuit states “the OBBBA provides no authority for EPA’s Elimination Decision.”

“The Trump administration is breaking the law to score political points, and Harris County residents shouldn’t have to pay that price,” Harris County Attorney Christian Menefee said in a statement posted on social media. “Congress appropriated this funding, EPA awarded it to Harris County after a rigorous competitive process.”

Dive Insight:

The Texas Solar for All Coalition was awarded nearly $250 million in 2024 to expand solar access across the state as part of the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund established by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. Harris County — the state’s largest county and home to Houston — led the coalition and secured more than $54 million.

On August 7, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced his agency would no longer implement the $7 billion Solar for All program, saying the OBBBA “repealed EPA’s authority to administer the program and rescinded all remaining funds.”

Zeldin said very little of the money had been spent and recipients were “still very much in the early planning phase, not the building and construction process.”

On Sept. 2, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit supported the EPA’s termination of Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund grants, stating the Biden administration modified the grant agreements “to make it more difficult for the government to terminate the grants.”

Harris County’s lawsuit asserts the OBBBA rescinds only $19 million in unobligated administrative costs, not the grant funds that were obligated by the IRA’s Sept. 30, 2024, deadline.

Rescinding the funding causes “irreparable harm to Harris County and its constituents,” the lawsuit states. “Harris County personnel and Texas Coalition staff have dedicated countless hours to setting up operations for Solar for All and working to deliver the program’s benefits to their constituents,” the plaintiffs state.

Eliminating the grants upends the county’s budgetary and strategic planning and undermines its reputation “as a reliable community and business partner,” according to the lawsuit.

As a temporary measure giving U.S. automakers an opportunity to play catch-up, the tariffs are understandable.
Next quarter’s EV sales are expected to flatline, as they did when Germany eliminated a similar tax subsidy.
Chinese EV makers, bolstered by significant government subsidies, have built a big advantage in manufacturing capacity, speed of design, supply-chain networks and, especially, price.","When the federal government’s electric-vehicle tax credits expired on Sept. 30, Hyundai made its move. The Korean automaker knocked as much as $10,000 off the price of its EVs in the U.S., more than making up for the taxpayer-funded $7,500 credit the GOP canceled years ahead of schedule in its “One Big Beautiful Bill Act.”

So, were Hyundai and the rest gouging Americans all along, using the tax incentive to greedily jack up profits? Doesn’t look that way: Market leader Tesla makes a decent profit, but for most other automakers, gas-powered vehicles have been much more profitable than their battery-operated counterparts. The credits were always meant to be temporary, and they’ve run their course. Whether Americans actually want electric vehicles is a question politicians can’t answer — only the market can.

Automakers should now prove they can stand on their own. Yet the outlook is fraught because of one big problem: China.

American automakers are losing a fight for the future against competitors bankrolled by the Chinese government. Stepping back and letting it happen stands to reduce economic growth, especially in the auto-dependent Midwest, and put America’s national security at risk as well.

So far, America’s response to the stiff competition is to bar Chinese vehicles altogether. President Donald Trump and former President Joe Biden, opposites in so many ways, agreed that opening the U.S. market to Chinese EV imports would hurt Detroit. Both administrations imposed enormous tariffs that keep out the competing vehicles.

As a temporary measure giving U.S. automakers an opportunity to play catch-up, the tariffs are understandable. But permanent protectionism is poison for innovation. Those trade barriers hurt American consumers who otherwise could be saving a fortune on their next vehicle purchase. And history shows that trade barriers can’t be sustained forever. America must gear up to beat its Chinese competitors mano a mano — and that’s not happening.

U.S. automakers just booked an excellent quarter for EV sales, as car buyers responded to the end of credits by accelerating purchases. Next quarter’s EV sales are expected to flatline, as they did when Germany eliminated a similar tax subsidy.

Into this sluggish sales environment, automakers will need to unload tens of thousands of EVs they have already manufactured. Some, like Hyundai, have decided to keep sales going by piling money on the hoods. Others will provide less direct incentives, while hoping their new EV and battery plants don’t go completely idle during the widely expected downturn ahead.

When its credits expired, Germany was much further along in adopting EVs than the U.S. Princeton University’s Zero Lab predicts that battery-powered EV sales in the U.S. will be about 40% lower as of 2030 without the credits than if the GOP had elected to continue them.

The Trump administration appears content to keep trade barriers in place and encourage Detroit to make gas-powered SUVs and pickup trucks for as long as possible. In that scenario, America’s expensive EVs are destined to be niche players at home and abroad. There’s also the question of whether Americans want — or can afford — electric vehicles.

If that’s the extent of the policy, the world will move on, and Detroit will be left in the dust. EV sales this year are expected to exceed 20 million vehicles, and China will make two-thirds of them, including millions for export. Anyone who thinks EVs are going away isn’t paying attention to the global market, especially emerging markets where, absent trade barriers, affordable Chinese models dominate.

Most Americans don’t recognize company names like BYD, Geely and Great Wall, but you’d better believe the Big Three know them. Ford’s Jim Farley has called China’s progress on EVs “the most humbling thing I have ever seen,” and said it poses a “colossal” threat to Ford’s future.

Chinese EV makers, bolstered by significant government subsidies, have built a big advantage in manufacturing capacity, speed of design, supply-chain networks and, especially, price. While all EVs are cheap to operate over their lifetimes – no gas required, few moving parts to repair — China is making high-quality vehicles at astonishingly low sticker prices. American automakers can’t come close.

America’s auto industry is an important strategic asset. It needs to be a world beater again, and that won’t happen unless it can meet the competition head-on.",https://bendbulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2025/10/OPED-USCHINA-AUTOMAKERS-EDITORIAL-SD-copy.jpg,N,,2025-10-14 13:03:54.305510

In partnership with Kia America and UC Irvine, Wallbox demonstrates vehicle-to-home tech as the Spain-based brand preps wider U.S. rollout

In a California neighborhood built for an all-electric future, six homes are quietly running on power pulled not from the grid—but from the car in the driveway.

Wallbox has completed the first U.S. residential installations of its Quasar 2 bidirectional EV charger, a system that allows drivers to both charge their electric vehicles and discharge that stored energy back into their homes. The milestone, achieved through a collaboration with Kia America and the University of California, Irvine (UCI), showcases how electric vehicles can double as backup power sources and energy management tools.

The first six Quasar 2 units were deployed in Menifee, California, where homeowners can now power essential loads directly from their Kia EV9s, effectively turning their vehicles into mobile batteries.

“This is more than a technology milestone. It is a glimpse of a future where every EV is an energy asset,” said Douglas Alfaro, Chief Business Development Officer at Wallbox. “Quasar 2 puts homeowners in control of their energy, helping them achieve resilience, independence, and sustainability in their daily lives.”

EVs as home batteries

The Quasar 2 enables vehicle-to-home (V2H) power flow—letting compatible EVs send electricity back into the house during outages or periods of high utility rates. When paired with Wallbox’s Power Recovery Unit, the system can supply up to three days of backup power, based on an average home’s daily consumption. Wallbox and Kia formed their partnership back in 2023.

“As we continue to expand our lineup of electric vehicles, projects like this help us showcase how EVs can deliver value beyond mobility,” said Sujith Somasekharan, Director of Connected Car & Mobility at Kia America. “Partnering with Wallbox and UCI allows us to show how our vehicles can power homes, reduce costs, and create meaningful environmental impact for families.”

The Wallbox Quasar 2 charger delivers up to 12 kW of power for both charging and discharging and can also integrate with solar systems through the company’s Power Meter for Energy Management Solutions, allowing customers to recharge their EVs directly from on-site solar generation.

A living lab for grid-smart neighborhoods

The demonstration is part of a broader pilot led by UCI’s Advanced Power and Energy Program (APEP), which studies how electric vehicles, smart homes, and distributed energy systems can coordinate to enhance grid stability.

“Real-world deployment of bidirectional charging is essential for gathering the data and technical insights needed to scale V2H deployment across the grid,” said Professor Scott Samuelsen, APEP’s founding director.

By operating in a residential setting, the Menifee project gives researchers a direct look at how homeowners interact with V2H systems—how often they use backup power, how it impacts energy costs, and how EVs can be managed as grid resources.

The word on Wallbox

Wallbox says broader U.S. availability for the Quasar 2 is next. Back in March, the Wallbox team announced pre-ordering availability for the Quasar 2 and Power Recovery Unit initially limited to California, Texas, Florida, New York, Washington, New Jersey, or Illinois, with a nationwide rollout to follow.

Founded in 2015, Wallbox has become one of the most active innovators in EV charging and energy management, offering solutions across more than 100 countries. Its growing partnership with Generac Power Systems—which made a minority investment in the company in 2023—will expand distribution of Wallbox products through Generac’s dealer network and integrate bidirectional EV charging into its broader home energy ecosystem.

The ended last month. The clean vehicle tax credit was worth $7,500 for new EVs and up to $4,000 for used ones.

Meanwhile, the Environmental Protection Agency has been working on easing rules aimed at cleaning up auto tailpipe emissions as the move to undo incentives for automakers to go electric. President Donald Trump has also challenged federal EV charging infrastructure money and blocked California’s ban of new gas-powered vehicle sales. It adds up to less pressure on automakers to continue evolving their production away from gas-burning vehicles.

General Motors, which had led the way among U.S. automakers with plans to convert production to an electric fleet of vehicles, said in a regulatory filing on Tuesday that it will have to book charges that include non-cash impairment and other charges of $1.2 billion due to EV capacity adjustments. There’s also $400 million in charges mostly related to contract cancellation fees and commercial settlements associated with EV-related investments.

GM warned that it may take additional hits as it adjusts production, with non-cash charges potentially impacting operations and cash flow in the future.

The company said that its EV capacity realignment doesn’t impact its retail portfolio of Chevrolet, GMC and Cadillac EVs currently in production, and that it expects those models to remain available to consumers.

EVs were considered to be the future of the US automotive industry. GM had announced in 2020 that it was going to invest $27 billion in electric and autonomous vehicles in the next five years, a 35% increase over plans made before the pandemic.

In 2021 GM said that it planned to have more than half of its North American and China factories be capable of making electric vehicles by 2030. It also pledged at the time to increase its investment in EV charging networks by nearly $750 million through 2025.

A year later, GM CEO said that the automaker would sell more electric vehicles in the U.S. than Tesla by the middle of the decade. GM also had a goal of making the vast majority of the vehicles it produces electric by 2035, and the entire company carbon neutral, including operations, five years after that.

Yet U.S. automakers are being hampered in some of their long-term planning, with drastic changes in economic and environmental policy from one administration to the next. The automakers are also facing increased competition from automakers such as China’s , which announced in July that its sales grew 31% in the first six months of the year to 2.1 million cars.

BYD’s sales have skyrocketed on the back of a government-driven EV boom in China. The rise of BYD and other Chinese electric vehicle makers is a challenge for Tesla and the world’s other major automakers as Chinese competitors push into Europe, Southeast Asia and other overseas markets with a relatively affordable option for drivers who want to go green.

Reliance on Public Charging

According to data from fast-charging provider EVgo Inc., experienced electric vehicle owners typically charge at home, while newer adopters rely more on public charging. These habits opened opportunities for businesses to expand their charging infrastructure.

The Times reported that retail and restaurant chains — including Cracker Barrel, Dunkin’, Target, Wawa, and Ikea — each added four to 14 charging stations. Additionally, Pilot Travel Centers activated 27 stations during the latest quarter.

EV Credits Gone

Reports of the expansion came nearly two weeks after federal electric vehicle tax credits ended. The incentives, valued at up to $4,000 for used vehicles and $7,500 for new ones, ended Sept. 30 following the passage of a Republican tax and spending package last July.

However, funding for charging is expected to continue after a federal court ordered President Donald Trump’s administration to restore billions in previously frozen funds in June.

Future of EV Sales

Still, Ford CEO Jim Farley recently warned that electric vehicle sales could fall to 5% without federal incentives, describing the market as “way smaller than we thought.”

As part of a West-wide market, utilities could manage those high-demand events by importing power from other parts of the region that are generating surplus electricity.
“Everybody’s able to share.” Western states do trade electricity on a bilateral basis between individual utilities.","For years, Western leaders have debated the creation of a regional energy market: a coordinated grid to pool solar power in Arizona, wind in Wyoming, hydro in Washington and battery storage in California.

The shared resources would meet the demands of 11 different states, bolstering utilities’ local power plants with surplus energy from across the region.

With the passage of a landmark new law in California, that market is finally on its way to becoming a reality. Proponents say it has the potential to lower energy costs, make the grid more resilient and speed up the deployment of clean energy.

But the market’s success, experts agree, depends heavily on which states and utilities decide to opt in. As energy issues have become increasingly politicized, it’s uncertain whether Western leaders can buy into a common vision for meeting the region’s power needs.

“As we move toward weather-dependent renewables to run our grid, we’ve got to have a grid that is bigger than a weather pattern,” said California Assemblymember Cottie Petrie-Norris, a Democrat who sponsored the legislation aimed at establishing the new market. “A Western energy market is critical.”

The California measure earned bipartisan support, and leaders in conservative and liberal states alike have long touted the benefits of a region-wide market.

But some skeptics worry about merging the power systems of states with varying climate goals. And some fear the new market could give federal regulators appointed by President Donald Trump an opening to interfere and mandate more fossil fuel-powered plants that can be turned on regardless of the weather.

A bigger market

Across the 11 Western states that straddle or sit west of the Rocky Mountains, 37 separate private and public utilities operate portions of the grid.

This fragmented structure differs from the grid systems in Eastern and Midwestern states, where regional transmission organizations, or RTOs, coordinate and plan for energy needs across vast swaths of the country.

Backers of a Western market argue that a region-wide approach would be much more efficient.

Under the current system, each utility is required by state public utility commissions to build enough power to meet peak energy demands. That could mean building gas plants that only turn on a few times a year during extreme heat waves.

As part of a West-wide market, utilities could manage those high-demand events by importing power from other parts of the region that are generating surplus electricity. Such agreements could also prevent the periodic shutdowns of wind and solar farms when they produce more energy than local utilities can use.

“We could be drawing on the solar resources from the Southwest during the day, and then in the evening the wind resources in Montana and Wyoming are a great benefit,” said Austin Scharff, senior energy policy specialist with the Washington State Department of Commerce. “We have a lot of hydro resources, and we can help make sure the regional grid stays balanced when those are needed.”

Some industry leaders say such trading would allow states to pull in cheap electricity from elsewhere, rather than building expensive new power plants.

“When you have this bigger market, not everybody has to build to their peak in the same way,” said Leah Rubin Shen, managing director with Advanced Energy United, an industry group focused on energy and transportation. “Everybody’s able to share.”

Western states do trade electricity on a bilateral basis between individual utilities. Utilities spanning much of the West also transact through a real-time market that allows them to address pressing short-term demand issues. Some are poised to join a new day-ahead market that will conduct planning based on daily demand and production forecasts.

But some lawmakers and officials believe the region needs a larger vision that goes beyond moment-by-moment needs, a market that can plan interstate transmission lines and energy projects to serve the whole region in the decades to come.

“We’re facing really rapidly growing energy demand,” said Nevada Assemblymember Howard Watts, a Democrat. “The best way for us to meet that is to effectively move energy all across the Western U.S. The only way we can do that is through an RTO.”

Watts sponsored a bill, enacted in 2021, that requires Nevada to join an RTO by 2030. Colorado also passed a law that year with a 2030 deadline for utilities to join an RTO.

“Any future is better than our status quo, which is 37 separate grids in the West,” said Chris Hansen, a former Democratic senator who sponsored the Colorado legislation. “We can lower costs and provide greater reliability if we’re sharing resources.”

Hansen now serves as CEO of La Plata Electric Association, an electric cooperative in southwestern Colorado.

A new market

The push for a West-wide market had always faced one major hurdle: Any market would likely include the massive geographical footprint and energy supply managed by the California Independent System Operator, or CAISO. As the West’s largest grid operator, CAISO manages the flow of electricity across most of the Golden State. It’s governed by a five-member board appointed by California’s governor, and other states were unlikely to sign up for a market in which they have no representation.

The law passed by California legislators last month allows for a new organization with independent governance from across the region to oversee Western energy markets.

“This legislation is a key reset and has been the largest sticking point in building a regional market,” said Amanda Ormond, managing director of the Western Grid Group, which advocates for a more efficient grid. “This is a primary concern of a lot of folks that has now been solved.”

The law sets in motion a yearslong process that will task regional leaders with establishing the organization’s governance and navigating a series of regulatory procedures. The new market could be in place by 2028.

State leaders across the West say the California law is a long-awaited development.

“You get this really good benefit from being able to optimize across a larger footprint than an individual utility can,” said Tim Kowalchik, research director with the Utah Office of Energy Development. “Those resources can play really well together.”

Utah led a study in 2021, collaborating with other Western states, exploring the potential for energy markets in the region. State officials say the research has helped drive the current effort.

“It was fascinating how substantial the benefits were,” said Letha Tawney, chair of the Oregon Public Utility Commission. “The interdependence of the West started to become much more apparent, and it really changed the conversation.”

The study looked at a variety of market options and found that an RTO would have significant benefits, lowering costs for electricity customers and promoting clean energy. Based on the study’s projections, the market would produce roughly $2 billion in gross benefits per year, largely by saving utilities from building extra capacity.

Another study in 2022, conducted by a pair of consulting firms, found that an RTO would create as many as 657,000 permanent jobs and bolster the region’s economy.

While Western leaders say the potential benefits are massive, no states outside of Nevada and Colorado have committed to joining a regional RTO. State leaders say they’ll be watching carefully to see what emerges from the new California law. While the decision on joining the market will largely be left to individual utilities, state regulators can play a major role by directing them to conduct an economic analysis of such a move.

State sovereignty

The push for a regional market has also faced opposition from skeptics who fear it undermines states’ power to set their own energy and climate goals. Some point to Eastern governors’ frustration with PJM Interconnection, the RTO that manages the grid across a swath of the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic.

“It’s very dangerous,” said Jamie Court, president of Consumer Watchdog, a California-based nonprofit advocacy group. “We’re giving up control of our sovereignty. Once a state’s in, it’s not the state that has the control.”

Some experts fear that states with significant coal or gas industries may be hesitant to join a market that could incentivize their utilities to import cheap solar power from elsewhere. On the flip side, some climate advocates in California are wary of plugging into a market that could support coal power from out of state.

“Some states are parochial-minded: ‘This is a California thing, and we don’t want anything to do with California,’” said Vijay Satyal, deputy director of markets and transmission with Western Resource Advocates, a nonprofit climate-focused group. “That one state’s government will not decide how a market will be operated, it’s a seismic shift in the industry.”

Backers of an RTO argue that it can incorporate states’ varying energy goals. They point to research showing that the market will support renewable power. But others fear merging fates with coal-heavy states could give federal regulators more leverage to intervene in favor of fossil-fuel power.

Even if Trump is out of office when the market comes online, the regulators he appoints to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will still be serving out their terms. Some believe FERC could set rules that require the new market to favor fossil fuel-powered resources.

“When you have a mixed market with a lot of coal plants, it creates opportunities for the Trump administration to rejigger the rules to favor coal,” said Matthew Freedman, renewables attorney with The Utility Reform Network, a California-based consumer advocacy group. “In another reality, this would have sounded like a hysterical concern, but it’s pretty obvious where [Trump’s appointees to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission] want to go.”

Freedman’s group pushed California lawmakers for protections that would have given states more flexibility to withdraw from the market, while also prohibiting “resource adequacy” mandates that could be used by the feds to prop up coal. While those elements were included in a Senate version of the bill, they were stripped from the Assembly bill that ultimately was passed.

Supporters of the bill say such concerns are overblown, and the new market is structured to avoid the pitfalls facing other RTOs.

“The simple economic fact is that right now clean energy resources are the cheapest in the world,” said Petrie-Norris, the law’s sponsor. “We’re going to see solar displacing dirty fuels rather than the reverse.”

Much depends on convincing states and utilities it’s in their best interests to join the market. The strength-in-numbers advantages of an RTO depend on widespread participation. While many Western leaders have long touted a region-wide market, the opportunity is arising at a time where energy has become a partisan issue.

Meanwhile, the long-awaited market emerging from California is facing new competition from the east. The Southwest Power Pool, an Arkansas-based RTO serving the middle of the country, is expanding its footprint in the West, with several utilities poised to join its day-ahead market.

“Anytime you have two neighboring utilities in different markets, you have seams that create a lot of friction and inefficiency,” said Rubin Shen, with the energy industry group. “Whether or not everybody can come together and be all-in on a full West-wide market, it’s too soon to tell.”

GM stock fell 3% in premarket trading to $53.96, even as the S&P 500 (SPX) and Dow Jones Industrial Average futures also dipped, by 0.9% and 0.5%, respectively.

In its statement, GM attributed much of the slowdown to changes in U.S. government policy. “Following recent U.S. Government policy changes, including the termination of certain consumer tax incentives for EV purchases and the reduction in the stringency of emissions regulations, we expect the adoption rate of EVs to slow,” the company said.

This shift means the massive battery plants and production lines GM built over the past several years will take longer to reach full capacity. The company’s “Factory ZERO” facility in Detroit, once a symbol of the EV future, now faces a slower ramp-up as consumer demand softens.

Accounting Rules Force Harsh Reality Check

The $1.6 billion charge reflects an accounting process that measures whether the value of assets can still be justified by future cash flow. Accounting expert Robert Willens explained, “For long-lived assets, you compare the net carrying value of the assets to the undiscounted net cash flows the assets are expected to produce over their useful lives. If the carrying amount exceeds the undiscounted net cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized.”

In other words, GM’s EV investments no longer appear capable of generating the returns once projected when federal incentives and stricter environmental rules were in place.

The impairment showcases the tension between government policy and corporate strategy. After years of aggressive investment in EV capacity, the rollback of key incentives has left automakers like GM caught between sunk costs and shifting demand dynamics.

Despite the write-down, GM’s EV sales continue to rise. The company delivered 66,501 electric vehicles in the third quarter, a 110% year-over-year increase and its best quarter to date. EVs now make up about 9.4% of its total U.S. vehicle sales.

The company said part of the surge reflected buyers rushing to take advantage of the $7,500 federal EV tax credit before it expired at the end of September. That short-term boost, however, may not translate into sustained growth as the incentive phaseout takes effect.

GM emphasized that the charge does not signal an abandonment of its EV goals but rather a recalibration of production schedules to align with market conditions.

Investors Sell GM Stock as Policy Friction Mounts

The sell-off in GM stock reflects investor concerns that the company’s massive EV buildout could take longer to pay off. While GM’s traditional gasoline vehicle lineup continues to drive profits, the EV division now represents a growing source of uncertainty.

Before the write-down, Wall Street analysts expected GM to generate about $11.4 billion in operating profit for 2025, down from nearly $15 billion in 2024. These forecasts may face further pressure if EV sales momentum fades.

Coming into Tuesday’s trading, GM shares were up about 4% year-to-date, with investors already wary of how import tariffs and policy reversals might weigh on margins. The latest charge confirms that the policy environment is now directly affecting automakers’ bottom lines.

EV Industry Confronts Political Reality

GM’s announcement adds to growing concern across the auto sector that the Trump administration’s policy shifts are impacting the EV industry. The removal of consumer tax credits and the easing of emissions standards have slowed adoption, while automakers are left with billions in EV investments that may take longer to pay off.

The broader message from GM’s charge is that the electric transition remains underway, but progress will likely be uneven as political and market forces collide. Moreover, the company’s $1.6 billion adjustment reflects a recalibration to new realities, not a retreat from its EV ambitions.

Is General Motors Stock a Good Buy?

Analyst sentiment toward General Motors (GM) remains cautiously optimistic even after the company’s $1.6 billion electric vehicle write-down. According to data from 18 Wall Street analysts over the past three months, GM holds a “Moderate Buy” consensus rating, with 13 analysts recommending a Buy, three suggesting a Hold, and two rating the stock a Sell.

The average 12-month GM price target sits at $65.89, implying an 18.46% upside from GM’s most recent closing price.

Alan Johnson spent more than 43 years working inside a chemical plant — a job that paid the bills, gave him purpose, and may have been slowly killing him all along.

Now 73, he lives about 15 miles outside Danville, Illinois, in a low-slung house with algae-streaked siding and a red barn out back. Inside, the rooms are dim and close. Model cars line the shelves. Pill bottles cluster on the table. Two dogs drift through the tight home — one calm, the other, Oreo, white-haired and rambunctious, eager to sit at Johnson’s feet.

It was raining the day we met. We’d planned to sit out front but instead settled in his living room, where a walker stood beside a worn recliner, and the window looked out onto wet grass. His hands shook and his voice wavered at times. The words came in fits and starts.

Parkinson’s, he said. Heart disease. Three kinds of dementia.

“You can’t hardly get a breath in there,” Johnson said, describing the air inside the chemical plant. He explained, “Even if you take a shower, you still got it on your skin.”

He spent decades working around vats of chemicals at the Danville factory now owned by Viscofan ($VIS.MC), the world’s largest producer of artificial meat casings. The plant emits carbon disulfide, hydrogen sulfide, ammonia, and other chemicals — all substances linked to neurological, respiratory, and cardiovascular harm.

He remembers the burn pits behind the building — how they’d torch waste before dumping the rest under what’s now a maintenance shed. He remembers red-tinted runoff in the creek out back and dead fish. He remembers Environmental Protection Agency officials showing up in the middle of the night and giving his boss 20 minutes to shut down a leak — or they’d shut the whole place down themselves.

The problems, he said, never really stopped. “They don’t want to fix it. It costs money.”

His wife never worked a day at the plant, but died from a bad heart. To this day, Johnson thinks he brought toxic chemicals home on his skin.

And he’s not alone.

Hunterbrook Media talked to more than 40 Danville locals and former Viscofan workers — some of whom were granted anonymity out of fear of retaliation — to gather firsthand accounts of the experience of living next to one of Illinois’ most problematic polluters. Many told the same story: a workforce scarred with an unusual number of health problems, a sick town, and a company that never seemed to answer for any of it.

Some said employees were paid off in exchange for silence. Some residents only posted anonymously online. Others wouldn’t speak at all.

Still, the stories surface.

The roof caving overhead. Pennies turning green in one worker’s pockets. An employee being told to take a taxi, instead of an ambulance, to the hospital after coming into contact with acid. Lick Creek, where some locals recall swimming as children, carrying trails of dead fish. Locals call it “the smell.” It’s sharp, metallic — like cat pee and rotten eggs. Some say it causes headaches. Others don’t notice it anymore. It’s just part of living in Danville.

Before Viscofan, the plant had been owned by an American company, Teepak — and was, workers say, better run and safer.

“Teepak, they took care of their employees, they took care of us,” Johnson said. “This place? I don’t think they even give hams anymore for Christmas.”

Viscofan, a Spain-based multinational that touts Danville as its largest plant in the United States, took over the plant in 2006. Locals say that’s when things got worse. Enforcement didn’t improve, and protections weakened. And the illnesses? They kept coming.

Since then, the company has repeatedly violated environmental law through uncontrolled emissions, routine discharges into local waterways, and mishandling toxic waste on its property, according to public records obtained by Hunterbrook. For years, Viscofan defused pressure from the Illinois EPA by signing compliance commitment agreements — at least five since 2015.

But in June, that familiar escape route collapsed. In a sharply worded letter to Viscofan’s U.S. leadership obtained by Hunterbrook via a public records request, the Illinois EPA signaled its intent to pursue legal action, arguing that the company’s latest proposed settlement was insufficient given the “nature and seriousness” of the violations.

And now, as sickness spreads and more names fill the obituary pages, Danville’s residents are left asking: Why is this plant still here?

The Factory Town

Danville’s past reads like a tale of Midwestern industrial glory. A city powered by factories, the kind of place where stable, well-paying jobs were plentiful and manufacturing was booming. General Electric, Chuckles, Bunge, and Heatcraft were there, along with a Hyster forklift plant, and a large General Motors foundry that employed thousands.

But like so many factory towns in the Midwest, Danville watched its economy drain out in slow motion as plants closed and people left. Since 1970, Danville has lost at least six manufacturers and more than a third of its population.

What followed is still playing out. Today, Danville’s violent crime rate is nearly 1,700 per 100,000 people — among the highest in Illinois. The headlines barely scratch the surface: a man stabbed in an alley behind a neighborhood gas station and another slashed in the neck. Vacant homes — long abandoned — go up in flames, sometimes several in a single week, each blaze engulfing more than crumbling boards. The city is stretched thin, and trust in public systems is largely gone.

One side of town, where Danville High School is located, still bears the bones of what it was — the other side wears what it’s become. Viscofan straddles that intersection.

The factory was built in 1957 by Teepak, then a U.S.-based meat casing company that supplied major meat processors with cellulose and fibrous film. For decades, Teepak was seen as a reliable employer that treated workers well. In 2006, the company was purchased by Viscofan. Danville became its flagship U.S. facility; as of 2023, the plant employed nearly 300 people. And today, the site sits on more than 2.3 million square feet of land and operates around the clock, according to the company. The Danville facility is seemingly the only Viscofan plant in the U.S. producing cellulose casing fibrings. Its facility in Montgomery, Alabama, converts “cellulose, fibrous, and plastics,” and its Bridgewater, New Jersey, plant focuses on collagen casings, according to the company’s website.

Other manufacturers still operate in Danville — including Mervis, Hyster‑Yale, Thyssenkrupp, and Flex‑N‑Gate — but among the locals Hunterbrook spoke with, there was a near-unanimous view that Viscofan stands apart, and not in a good way.

“My mother worked for Bunge for years, and she never had issues with that place,” said Amanda Brady, a former Viscofan employee. “Hyster is just a place that ships parts — no fumes at all. Viscofan is the worst place I have ever worked. I didn’t mind the job itself, but the environment was horrible and was getting worse by the day.”

Where the plant is located tells its own story.

Viscofan backs up against some of the most distressed housing in Vermilion County. Fair Oaks, a nearly 200-unit public housing complex, sits a little over half a mile away. When a Hunterbrook reporter visited the complex in July, the neglect was evident — worn brick buildings with rusting window frames in need of repair.

Some of the homes in the streets just behind the plant echo the same pattern: overgrown lawns, dirty siding, personal belongings, even a refrigerator, catching dust on porches. Within a one-mile radius of Viscofan, 64% of residents are low-income, and around 25% of households earn under $15,000 a year.

A Hunterbrook analysis of property data shows that many of the cheapest homes in Danville cluster tightly around the Viscofan plant. Properties within half a mile sell for a median of just $47,500, and home values remain depressed out to nearly two miles.

Beyond that ring, values climb steeply. By three miles, the median home price has nearly doubled to $68,000, reaching about $90,000 by five miles. At the 10-mile mark, the median reaches $109,000 — more than twice as high as homes closest to the smokestacks.

The disparity holds even after adjusting for home size. Within two miles, the median home price is about $35 to $40 per square foot, compared to over $72 per square foot 10 miles out. Lot sizes also expand steadily: a median of 7,000 square feet near the plant, versus more than 11,000 square feet about 10 miles out.

In short, Viscofan’s footprint doesn’t just happen to sit amid low property values — it defines a gradient of cheaper and smaller housing radiating outward from the plant.

Still, some lash out at the critics. “Complaining about a smell, then complain when they close down, and folks are out of work as local industry further dive bombs,” one resident wrote in a comment on Facebook. “It’s not a perfect world.”

In Danville, that kind of tension is just another part of the landscape. Viscofan is still here — and that’s either the problem or the point.

Sick and Spreading

“If you made it out,” said Damian Street, a former Viscofan employee, “you were going to die in six months.”

Street worked at the plant for nearly seven years, first as a process technician. He’d grown up just blocks from the plant, back when it was still Teepak, and said his grandfather had retired from the quality lab there. But by the time he started in 2016, the stories he’d heard as a kid — about the air, the chemicals, the people getting sick — were no longer rumors. They were realities he was starting to see up close, every day.

“There’s been numerous people out there get cancer last few years, and I’m worried myself about it now,” he said. “I had a neighbor that used to work there. … He made it about a year before he died. It was so aggressive that there was nothing that could be done.”

The longer Street stayed, the more it felt like the place was eating people alive. He spoke of toxic salt dumped straight onto the ground, walls dissolving under acid leaks, metal beams crumbling to flakes in months. “I’ve seen this stuff eat like complete metal,” he said. “If it’s doing that to concrete and cinder blocks and I-beams, what do you think it’s doing to your actual body?”

Over time, his colleagues started to disappear.

“It’s like two or three people have died since I’ve left from out there that have gotten cancer and died,” he said. “The EPA comes out there — they [Viscofan] make it look pretty, they do what they got to do to get by, and then they go right back to square one.”

Street’s stories weren’t an outlier. In fact, they fit into a pattern Hunterbrook began to uncover after four months of interviews, records searches, and outreach.

Hunterbrook reached out to hundreds of former workers at Viscofan’s Danville plant. Dozens responded, and nearly 20 agreed to speak. Several said they were currently battling cancer, breathing issues, Parkinson’s disease, or another severe health condition, or had recently recovered. The others pointed to friends and coworkers who hadn’t been so lucky. Through interviews, Hunterbrook learned of at least 20 former employees at the Danville plant who had developed serious health issues.

Most had cancer, but there were also reports of neurological disease and cardiovascular damage. Several also reported dental issues after leaving the plant. Brandy Lake, a former lab employee, experienced issues with her teeth and gums. In total, Brady lost 20 teeth following her time at the plant.

To understand how that could happen, we had to understand what working inside Viscofan actually meant.

Employees said that Viscofan prohibits them — but not supervisors — from bringing mobile devices into the plant. Johnny Gonzalez, a former Viscofan worker, recounted being told by his supervisors that the company was wary of trade secrets being leaked to competitors if pictures were taken.

But nearly 80 photos and videos obtained by Hunterbrook — shared by former employees willing to break company rules to expose the inner workings of the factory — reveal a grim portrait of life in and around the plant.

Inside the Plant

Viscofan is where your hot dog casing comes from — and where workers say the roof crumbles above your head and the walls are eaten away by salt.

Viscofan’s Danville plant manufactures cellulose sausage casings — transparent, high-gloss membranes used to hold hot dogs, ham sausages, and lunch meats. The product is simple. The process to make it is not.

The Danville plant uses the viscose process, a multistage chemical operation involving wood pulp, carbon disulfide, caustic soda, and sulfuric acid. In general, the sequence is controlled: Pulp is steeped in sodium hydroxide, aged, and reacted with carbon disulfide to create sodium cellulose xanthate. That compound is dissolved into viscose — a thick orange liquid — which is extruded into tubes and passed through regenerating acid baths made from sulfuric acid, which results in sodium sulfate. The cellulose is then regenerated into solid casings that are then dried and rolled into reels.

Robert Rust, a retired Iowa State University meat science professor who previously consulted for Teepak, said that this process isn’t unique to Viscofan. “I think that was the only process … for manufacturing those types of cases,” Rust said, noting that just a few companies have ever done it at scale in the United States — namely Viscofan and its competitor, Viskase. He described the market as “a classic oligopoly,” where the basic viscose formula and sulfuric acid bath have been standard for decades.

But standard doesn’t mean safe. The International Agency for Research on Cancer classifies strong inorganic acid mists containing sulfuric acid as Group 1 — carcinogenic to humans — with greater risk in hot, poorly ventilated operations. At Viscofan, former workers said, dangerous exposure is normal.

The consequences could be immediate. Brady recalled a man being sprayed with 93% sulfuric acid — a concentration that can easily cause chemical burns and be corrosive to steel. Instead of calling an ambulance, the safety manager at the site made him wait while they summoned a taxi, Brady said.

Sulfuric acid, in particular, is no trivial chemical in the plant. In 2023, the Danville plant used about 6,700 tons of sulfuric acid, and at any given moment, it maintains two 65,940-gallon tanks of 93% sulfuric acid on-site, according to an Illinois EPA inspection report reviewed by Hunterbrook.

On the floor, it was seen as proof of how even life-threatening emergencies were treated as routine inconveniences inside the plant.

“They would put you under the shower station and if you felt fine after, they tell you to get a set of dry clothes and then get back to work,” one former worker said about acid exposure incidents at the plant.

When the viscose process is run cleanly, emissions are largely contained by scrubbers and solvent recovery systems. At Viscofan, it’s not.

The issues begin before production even starts. Trains bring in tankers of bulk chemicals — namely sulfuric acid — via a side rail that runs directly into the plant. According to photos obtained by Hunterbrook, the ground near the unloading lines is damp with runoff and ripe with dark liquid pooling between the tracks. The liquid, which former employees say is full of chemicals, seeps into gravel and concrete. In at least one instance, the chemical-stained ground was covered by wooden pallets.

Once inside the facility, the breakdowns escalate. Carbon disulfide and hydrogen sulfide — both toxic, flammable gases — are generated during the extrusion phase, where viscose is shaped into its final form. And while the majority of hydrogen sulfide is removed through caustic scrubbers, carbon disulfide is not.

Photos obtained by Hunterbrook show hydrogen sulfide concentrations of 10.7 parts per million on a fixed wall monitor, and up to 40 ppm on a handheld reader inside the plant.

For reference, exposure to just 2 to 5 ppm can cause headaches and nausea. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health recommends no more than 10 ppm of exposure in any 10-minute period, and OSHA sets a ceiling at 20 ppm over an eight-hour window for plants like Viscofan. Brady, the former lab employee, described Viscofan’s heightened levels as a regular occurence, and said evacuations happened roughly three times a year.

According to former workers, some areas of the plant are badly eroded, and rust and cracks in the concrete on the plant floor are common sights. “The ground under the acid tanks is eroded enough to park cars there,” said a person with knowledge of the plant’s operations.

In one picture obtained by Hunterbrook, a large concrete tank marked as “25% CAUSTIC” outside the plant showed significant cracks at its base with liquid seeping through.

Extrusion was especially bad, said Gonzalez, who said he worked at the plant from 2014 to 2016. The area was hot, humid, windowless, and almost pitch-black, and the ventilation was bad, he recalled. Giant rolls of paper were fed into dies, coated with viscose, and run through a series of acid tanks and rollers. When the casing broke, workers had to reach shoulder-deep into chemical baths, their clothes and skin soaked, according to Gonzalez. He said masks were communal, tethered to short air hoses, and often useless for the reach the job required.

“I would like, wake up feeling like I couldn’t breathe,” he recalled. “It felt like something was inside there, clogging it up.”

Outside the building, things don’t improve. Behind the plant are two wastewater basins known as the lagoons. In a 2023 report from the Illinois EPA, an inspector reported that the first of these, the north lagoon, received caustic material from 250-gallon totes of viscose for treatment. The second, the south lagoon, has an outfall that leads directly into the publicly owned treatment works. After the chemical waste is treated, workers routinely dredge the sludge from the lagoons for removal, according to a former employee.

“I couldn’t tell you how many animals have went across there and probably have just become part of whatever the hell is in the bottom of that lake,” said one former employee. That same employee was diagnosed with cancer within six months after leaving Viscofan.

A Record of Excess

Viscofan’s Danville plant has violated the Clean Air Act in seven of the last 12 quarters, according to the EPA. Each of those quarters included a violation marked as “high-priority” — one of the agency’s most serious categories, reserved for violations most likely to significantly harm human health and local environments or threaten the act’s programs.

And yet, the plant continues to operate at full tilt — treating less of its emitted gases on average and releasing carbon disulfide on a scale unmatched by any other casing facility in the country, according to Hunterbrook’s analysis.

In 2023, Viscofan’s Danville plant reported releasing 2.4 million pounds of carbon disulfide into the air. By comparison, the second-largest emitter in the country — Viskase’s Loudon, Tennessee, plant — reported less than 2 million pounds, with no significant violations of the Clean Air Act.

Carbon disulfide is a neurotoxin linked to memory impairment, peripheral neuropathy, and cardiovascular damage. Viscofan’s Danville plant emits an average of nearly 7,000 pounds per day, and a 2019 report from an independent research institute did not note the use of flares or biofilters — even though the Illinois EPA found in 2008 that biofiltration would be possible at the site. In filings with the EPA, the company has argued that carbon disulfide is “required to get cellulose completely into solution” — and warned that “product quality may decline” if it is compelled to reduce it.

Despite a 47% decline in emissions of hydrogen sulfide between 2012 and 2019, levels have since picked up and grown 45%. The plant’s RSEI Hazard score — an EPA measure of toxic exposure — is more than 3,300 times higher than the median among other unlaminated plastics shaping facilities nationwide.

Ammonia is another recurring pollutant. In 2014, Viscofan’s Danville plant reported releasing nearly 339,000 pounds. That number was over 145,000 pounds in 2023 — still high relative to most other casing plants. The company has stated that “reducing the amount used may impact quality and yield.”

Hydrogen sulfide, another toxic gas produced during cellulose conversion, is largely removed by a caustic scrubber, but some is still emitted. According to a report from the Illinois EPA, Viscofan is allowed to release up to 15 pounds per hour — which amounts to tens of thousands of pounds annually.

Solid waste has triggered red flags, too. Street recalled issues at the landfill about five years ago after unwashed casing waste was dumped without proper treatment. “These guys were dumping this casing right into the tote, taking it right to the dumpster,” he said. “Well, this stuff reacts with certain temperatures, so they were having flare-ups.”

He also said the company routinely ran defective machinery that produced unusable product — adding more chemical-laced scrap to the load. “They will run junk all day long,” Street said, “instead of shutting the machine down and trying to fix it.”

One man — who said he used to haul Viscofan’s waste for trash collection company Republic Services — said he witnessed the disposal operation firsthand.

“I saw it with my own eyes,” he told Hunterbrook.

He estimated he’d removed waste from about three 20-yard dumpsters of chemical sludge, three salt-filled 10-yard dumpsters, and compacted trash on a near-daily basis, including most weekends. A photo taken on Viscofan’s property obtained by Hunterbrook shows one such 20-yard dumpster lined with black plastic and stacked with yellow-orange blocks of solid chemical residue, according to the worker. The gelatinous blocks, he explained, are known as “solidified viscose” — the juices squeezed out of meat casings, collected in mini bulk tanks, left to harden, and then dumped once solid.

“It was so bad it rotted the dumpsters out on the bottom,” he said.

But he isn’t the only one who has had issues with the waste generated at Viscofan’s Danville plant. So has the Illinois EPA.

Viscofan produces three major types of solid waste: sodium hydroxide solution, a byproduct of the viscose process; xanthate crumb, the byproduct of the reaction between carbon disulfide and cellulose; and viscose that didn’t meet manufacturing standards.

In 2015, the company officially crossed the line into being “a large quantity generator” of hazardous waste after it produced more than 1,000 kilograms of corrosive sodium hydroxide in a month, according to an Illinois EPA report. By the following year, it also generated over 1,000 kilograms of flammable solids containing carbon disulfide in one month. That classification carried strict obligations: Label every container, store it properly, and ship it off-site within 90 days.

Viscofan did almost none of it, according to records from an inspection by the Illinois EPA on August 10, 2023, after it received a complaint.

On that day, the inspection report indicates, Britney Rutherford, an inspector from the Illinois EPA, asked Alvaro Mendoza, a company representative, how many totes of waste were present in different areas of the plant. He stated that there were approximately 350 totes in total. But when she walked the yard herself, the scale was much greater.

According to the report, Rutherford found more than 1,300 250-gallon totes scattered across Viscofan’s sprawling campus in Danville. Of those totes, some were dated back to 2021; one carried two different dates, marked in 2022 and again in 2023; and some even leaked caustic solution directly onto the ground.

Rutherford asked Mendoza to explain the sheer volume of waste on-site — but instead of acknowledging the backlog, in English he downplayed the problem, according to the report. In Spanish, though, Mendoza told someone that the inspector had exaggerated the count — despite photographs showing row after row of totes scattered across the yard.

“Viscofan is operating an unpermitted hazardous waste landfill,” Rutherford wrote in her report of the site inspection. “Dumping or allowing the continued spills of corrosive wastes onto the ground near the pond constitutes an unpermitted hazardous waste landfill without any of the engineering requirements of an actual landfill.”

The inspection notes also revealed a more systemic failure: Viscofan was misclassifying its waste. Instead of labeling viscose waste when it was first collected, the company waited until it aged and separated. At that point, the sodium hydroxide solution, the harmful part, had already been decanted, and the determination was made only afterward, leading to a misclassification of the hazardous waste.

The company’s own record contradicted that practice. Its contingency plan from November 19 and prior waste shipments to a disposal firm explicitly characterized the viscose solution as corrosive hazardous waste, according to the report. Yet when asked to label totes accordingly, employees apparently marked them as nonhazardous. When regulators requested a proper waste profile three times, Viscofan twice sent profiles only for the solids that had been treated, not for the liquid layer or the untreated waste as it was actually generated, according to the report. Only when Illinois EPA staff arrived on site to take their own samples did the company finally provide a complete profile. It confirmed what was already clear: The viscose solution was a corrosive hazardous waste.

By the end of that inspection, Rutherford was convinced that Viscofan was cutting corners in its waste management process — and slapped the company with 21 violations. She noted that properly disposing of all the discarded and off-spec viscose would cost the company over $700,000.

The violations set off a chain of escalating consequences. On October 30, 2023, the Illinois EPA issued a formal notice of violation. Viscofan delivered its first response on December 18, and barely a month later, on January 18, 2024, company officials were called into a meeting with state regulators to account for what inspectors had found. In that meeting, the plant claimed that the amount of waste Rutherford found was “atypical” — and blamed it on Republic Services, claiming the local trash hauler refused to accept the solidified waste.

By February 8, 2024, Viscofan tried to bargain with a compliance plan — but regulators weren’t buying it. Just a week later, the Illinois EPA warned the matter was so serious it might be handed off to prosecutors. That warning hung over the plant for more than a year, until on June 24, the Illinois EPA made its move: a letter of intent to pursue legal action.

And that is not the only legal problem facing Viscofan. In October 2024, the Illinois EPA referred two different violations to the U.S. EPA for use in separate federal enforcement actions regarding the company’s operations in Danville, according to a spokesperson for the state agency.

One involves a 2023 enforcement action over repeated air permit and emissions reporting violations dating back several years, including failures to properly monitor, test, and document sulfur compound emissions. The other, a 2021 case, centers on emissions-related compliance issues, including alleged lapses in maintenance, recordkeeping, and incident reporting.

The Locals

The harmful impacts of Viscofan’s operations don’t end at the factory’s fence line.

Before process gases are released into the air, Viscofan is required to clean them using a scrubber system — a device that brings polluted air into contact with a liquid to absorb or neutralize contaminants. When functioning properly, a scrubber can remove the vast majority of harmful emissions.

At the Danville plant, however, that isn’t always happening.

According to a picture obtained by Hunterbrook and a person familiar with the plant, stacks fans in one part of the plant — which vent gases from the extrusion process — appeared to be disconnected from the scrubber system responsible for removing harmful emissions. The elbows that would normally connect the fans to the scrubbers are missing, the person said, allowing fumes to vent directly into the atmosphere — unchecked.

Viscofan has been accused of skimping on proper air scrubber practices several times before. In 2015 and 2021, the Illinois EPA issued air-related violations to the plant, alleging that it emitted hydrogen sulfide beyond limit — and that its scrubbers underperformed in controlling toxic releases. In both cases, Viscofan struck compliance commitment agreements, promising better emissions control.

But drone footage of Viscofan taken by Hunterbrook on August 19 suggests that incidents of that kind are not relegated to the past. The video shows at least one stack fan visibly disconnected from its air scrubber, parts of which appear to be scattered across the terrace. The footage also captured the fan venting at the same time — releasing fumes into the air.

Similarly, in an aerial shot taken by Indy Drone Video, an Indiana-based videography group, in June 2023, one of Viscofan’s scrubbers again appears to be inactive — except this time the opposite stack fan is venting freely into the air.

Those same stacks, one person familiar with the plant said, contain equipment meant to measure emissions in parts per million. Federal and state guidelines limit how much can be released.

It is unclear what chemicals could be released from the particular stack vents that Hunterbrook identified as lacking proper scrubber control. An air test conducted independently by Hunterbrook just outside Viscofan’s entrance detected acetonitrile — a colorless, flammable solvent used in industrial processes, including plastics and pharmaceuticals production. It’s also used regularly in the process of casting and molding plastics.

According to the EPA, chronic inhalation of acetonitrile could result in “cyanide poisoning from metabolic release of cyanide after absorption.” The agency also notes that inhalation can affect the central nervous system and result in “headaches, numbness, and tremor.”

Chemicals released by Viscofan present a dual risk in Danville: They can travel through the air via smokestack emissions or leaks, and they can seep into water systems — most notably Lick Creek, a slow-moving waterway behind Viscofan’s industrial wastewater lagoons.

These open-air lagoons are used to store and treat runoff from the plant, located just feet from the creek’s edge. Contaminants from the lagoons can leach into the water table, flow downstream, or evaporate into the surrounding air.

One clear example of this vulnerability occurred last year. On July 10, 2024, Danville received about 4 inches of rainfall — enough to noticeably raise the levels of the lagoons behind the plant relative to levels seen just three days later. With close proximity to Lick Creek, that kind of surge increases the risk of overflow, runoff, and contamination.

The August 19 drone footage shows the lagoon ending just a few feet from the creek’s bank.

In 2013, the Illinois EPA issued a permit for Viscofan’s Danville plant covering discharges to Lick Creek and setting pH and other limits. But Viscofan has repeatedly violated that agreement over the past decade.

The plant operates three outfalls, each discharging into Lick Creek. Since 2014, it has released high-pH and chemically contaminated water into the creek at least 20 times, according to records reviewed by Hunterbrook. Among the chemicals in these incidents: Red Dye 40, a sodium hydroxide solution, and scrubber liquid all flowing into the creek without control because of worker mistakes, poor manufacturing procedures, or aging equipment.

And at times, the contamination has been serious enough to trigger action from the Illinois EPA. In 2015, 2017, and 2018, Viscofan was cited for violating the Illinois Environmental Protection Act in connection with discharges — or conditions that could cause discharges — affecting local waterways.

When a Hunterbrook reporter visited the creek, the smell was sharp and unmistakable — a chemical musk hanging over the water.

Some residents who live near Lick Creek have echoed these concerns online. “They also dump the chemicals in water behind them,” wrote a local, whose home borders the creek. “I live on Daisy Lane by there — dead fish all the time.” Another resident replied, “I was told the same thing.”

In Danville, symptoms tied to chemical exposure aren’t theoretical. They’re routine.

“I’ve been back in Danville now for about 10 years,” said Sheena Morris. “I was born and raised here.” She’s been working full-time at a print shop less than a mile from Viscofan for more than three years now.

“There’s always a smell,” she said. “It gets really bad a couple to three times a week. Sometimes it’s like rotten eggs, like a sulfur smell to it … like a boiling hot dog.”

Her father, Tom Kelly, who owns the shop, has cancer — several types. So did her fiancé, who died last September. Two employees have been diagnosed — one with breast cancer twice, another with skin cancer. Her grandmother died of cancer. “I know a lot more people that have it really at this point in my life than don’t,” she said.

Cases of bottled water were stacked in the entryway and back rooms of Morris’ ink shop when a Hunterbrook reporter visited. Some locals don’t drink from the tap.

“We just don’t trust it,” Morris said. “I smell just a bunch of chlorine. They’re constantly treating it and then sending out notices about that too.”

When asked about the community response, she was blunt: “Nobody does really anything about that.”

“It employs people. So they’re not pushing back because they need the jobs in this community,” she added.

The health impacts she described are echoed in public data. Between 2018 and 2022, Danville’s 61832 zip code recorded 1,196 cancer cases — an annual rate of about 700 per 100,000 people. That’s far above the Illinois state average of 561.

And while there is no direct proof of a causal connection between the chemicals emitted by the factory and the health outcomes in the surrounding areas, community sentiment certainly lays some blame at Viscofan’s feet.

“My dad worked there when I was a kid,” wrote a local on a community Facebook page. “He would come home in the morning after working 3rd and the Pennie’s in his pocket would be green. … Place is nasty.”

“Came home smelling like cat pee,” another local recalled of her boyfriend who worked at the plant. “Some there have to wear mask[s]. It’s bad for the workers and environment.”

A local who said they worked at Viscofan recalled the factory removing its smokestack and facing repeated fines: “If there not burning off the chemicals I don’t see why the people living in the area can’t sue them.”

One woman said her father died of cancer after working at the plant. Another person said he knew multiple workers who died of heart attacks in their 40s. One local called Danville the “cess pool of the country.” Others described the plant as toxic and explosive: “It can even lead to infertility in women.”

Don’t Talk, Don’t Ask

Street started working in maintenance at Viscofan in 2016. At first, he liked it. “I thought, ‘Man, this is great,’” he said. “Days off, swing shift, rotating shift — what I wanted to do.”

But over time, the problems piled up. He said proper safety precautions often weren’t followed, and workers handled a slew of toxic chemicals without proper respiratory protection. “I had to take breaths, had to get down from where I was at before I lost my breath and actually passed out,” he said.

He also recalled a serious injury. “That one girl got her arm stuck in the roller,” Street said. “It literally rolled her arm for, like, 10 minutes before they actually got her out.”

For two to three years, he said, he lifted heavy weights completely alone. “I was lifting these 65-70,000 pound dies by myself and hanging them up in these bays and these tanks by myself.”

When he raised concerns about safety and contamination, he believed it made him a target. “They got rid of me because I was vocal,” he said. “I’m very vocal about stuff. … You can’t run from me. I’m gonna express my concerns and opinions about it.”

One day during lunch shortly after he raised complaints, he rested his head on top of his toolbox, he said. A Viscofan executive took a photo and accused him of sleeping. Street said he still had time left on his break and wasn’t asleep. The photo was used to put him on a “last chance agreement,” he said. He was later fired for “performance.”

“My performance? I said, ‘I was here for seven years and now all of a sudden my work performance is a problem,’” Street recalled telling his boss.

He said he wasn’t alone. Other workers who spoke up, he said, were also walked out.

And the woman who got her hand caught in the machine? “They just paid her off. Well, don’t say nothing about it,” he said.

The Union Collapse

For years, Viscofan’s union had been a buffer between management and workers — a place employees could take grievances about safety, conditions, and retaliation. But in May of this year, that structure effectively collapsed.

In a May 20 letter to hourly employees that was shared with Hunterbrook, Viscofan wrote that it was “withdrawing recognition” of the local chapter of the union represented by the United Food & Commercial Workers International Union, claiming that a majority had signed a petition requesting the move. Effective immediately, the company suggested, the union would no longer represent them. In the same breath, the CEO of Viscofan’s U.S. operations promised wage increases and new benefits — coming soon.

Whether Viscofan’s move is legal isn’t clear-cut. Traditionally, a union can be decertified through a secret-ballot election run by the National Labor Relations Board. But U.S. law also allows it if an employer has objective evidence the union has lost majority support — as Viscofan seemingly suggested in its letter to employees.

But by pledging raises and benefits in the same letter, the company risked appearing to offer incentives for rejecting union representation — a move that could violate federal labor law.

Michael C. Duff, a professor at the Saint Louis University School of Law and a former NLRB attorney, expressed skepticism about the company’s decision.

“The idea that it put references to improvements in benefits in a letter that it sent all employees suggests to me that either they don’t have the advice of counsel, or it’s possible that somebody doesn’t know U.S. labor law,” he said.

In a letter to Viscofan’s CEO on September 16, four members of the Congressional Labor Caucus also cast doubt on Viscofan’s letter to workers. They declared that the May letter to workers “clearly violates the National Labor Relations Act” and pointed to the company’s alleged attempt last year to pressure employees into signing a petition to weaken the union’s ability to collect dues.

They called on the company to negotiate honestly with the union. Yet today, the future of union protection for Viscofan workers remains unclear, and the union’s May 28 challenge before the NLRB has made little progress.

According to Alec Severins — the head of Vermilion County Watchdog, a community Facebook page — the company’s decision to unrecognize the union came shortly after he began looking into claims of runoff behind Viscofan’s anhydrous tanks and sharing concerns with union representatives. “Their union is real big on safety,” he said.

He described it as the tipping point in what had already been years of escalating tension between management and organized labor. “Union troubles have been going on for a few years,” he said. “But we haven’t seen anything like this happen.” (In 2019, workers at Viscofan’s Danville plant went on strike, leading the company to quickly sign a new collective bargaining agreement.)

Since then, Severins said, many employees feel they’ve been left with no option but silence. “Right now, since the union’s gone, they feel like they can’t speak up,” he said. “They’ll be retaliated against.”

The collapse of the union also coincided with a quiet shift in Viscofan’s workforce. Lake, the former lab employee, and one other employee said that by 2022, as much as 75% of Viscofan’s workforce in Danville had been hired from the company’s plants outside of the continental U.S. (Viscofan has manufacturing sites in Spain, Brazil, Mexico, Germany, China, and seven other countries outside of the U.S.).

Viscofan declined to comment on the makeup of workers at its Danville facility or the legality of its decision to withdraw recognition of the union.

Tim Miller, a former Viscofan employee, wrote in a post on Facebook that the shift in hiring practices was tied directly to the union’s weakening over the years. Without local hires and without a powerful union, he wrote, there were fewer protections. “They want to rid this place of the union and turn it into a minimum wage hell hole,” he wrote. “Bottom line. It’s their way or the highway. They show no respect for a binding CBA.”

Street, the former maintenance worker, echoed similar concerns. He said a strong union had once been a line of defense against dangerous conditions and retaliation. Without it, workers feared the worst.

“Now that these guys won’t have union representation, it’s going to be even worse,” he said. “Who you gonna go tell?”

Viscofan declined to address any of the allegations raised by workers — including unsafe working conditions, uncontrolled pollution, inadequate emission controls, and reported retaliation against those who spoke out. Instead, a spokesperson for the company insisted that it met “strict local and international standards for quality, safety, and employee well-being.”

No Protection

Viscofan’s Danville plant relies on highly toxic and corrosive chemicals, but former workers say basic protective gear was scarce and safety protocols were rarely enforced.

One former worker in the chemical department said he was routinely burned through his gloves by caustic substances. “You were on a two-pair-of-gloves limit a week,” he said. “As soon as your hand hit caustic, the gloves were ruined.”

“I don’t know how many pairs of gloves I was basically forced to wear, because they’re like, ‘No, I can’t give you any more — I’ve reached the limit,’” he added.

He recalled finishing shifts with his pants and shirts soaked in chemicals. “That stuff gets on you — it burns you,” he said. “I’ve probably still got scars on my hands.” Workers were told to rinse chemical burns with soap and water — a method he later found out could irritate the caustic even further. When he tried to raise concerns about exposure risks or ventilation, he said little changed. “Unless there’s a life or death situation, they pretty much brush it off,” he said.

Gonzalez, who worked for two years at the plant, recalled asking his supervisors to replace a drip pan in the plant — a metal tray meant to catch chemicals. The existing one, he said, had been removed, leaving chemicals dripping onto him for months.

“It took them about three months to put another drip pan on there,” he said. “I feel like they don’t really care about their employees at all.”

Johnson, the longtime Viscofan worker who first joined the plant under Teepak in the 1970s, added that respiratory protection was almost nonexistent at first. “They didn’t have masks or anything else. You just did what you wanted,” he said. In his later years, he noticed management began encouraging younger workers to wear masks, but never enforced it across the board.

Brady, who worked in Viscofan’s lab for more than four years, recalled trying to evacuate a workspace due to gas levels above the safety threshold. “As I proceeded to do that due to the exhaust fans not working,” she said, “the supervisors and the higher-ups in management said they are fine and to keep working — and refused to evacuate the employees.”

Others voiced even deeper distrust. Some former lab workers alleged that they had been asked to falsify internal safety data — and that outside oversight was limited. “Every time somebody tries to make a complaint to OSHA, nothing ever gets done,” said Lake, who said she was responsible for recording Viscofan’s gas levels inside the plant.

“I was told by the person training me to only write down good numbers and not to bother the supervisors about the bad readings because they would not do anything anyway,” she recalled.

When she did record actual gas levels and reported them once they became concerning, her warnings were dismissed. She said she was told that “there was nothing they could do because their hands were tied by the owners of Viscofan.”

Several others echoed the sentiment, saying they believe regulators routinely ignored or overlooked issues.

Even major safety certifications, one worker alleged, were treated like pageantry. Street said the plant’s BRC audits usually ended with a barely passing grade. When a new auditor came in, he initially failed the facility outright. A month or two later, he returned and gave the plant a glowing score. Street said nothing changed between the two visits, with the exception that Viscofan “hadn’t swayed him” the first time around.

Despite years of allegations, Viscofan has faced limited OSHA enforcement. The most serious, and expensive, action came only in July 2024, when the agency cited Viscofan’s Danville facility for one repeat violation, seven serious violations, and one other-than-serious violation. The initial penalties totaled just under $200,000 and documented incidents where workers were hospitalized, caught in rollers, and burned with hazardous chemicals, all with insufficient preventative action taken by the company.

But according to photos of notices posted inside the plant and obtained by Huntebrook, Viscofan has received at least three complaints since 2022. The complaints allege that workers were exposed to shock and burn hazards, unlevel and trip-prone working surfaces, and harmful levels of carbon disulfide and ammonia — claiming the plant had “not implemented controls” to remove hazardous gases from the breathing area.

For now, oversight has come in bursts before fading back into the hum of daily life. On paper, the system has worked: the penalties are paid and the doors stay open. But in Danville, the air still smells the same.

In town, there’s perhaps no one who knows Viscofan better than Deborah Stacey. She lives just across the road, in a sagging house where the lawn has grown wild and chairs and tables lie flipped all around.

She’s a squatter, sick with cancer — and she’s learned to live with the industrial hum, and smell, that settles over her front porch every night.

“Sometimes you gotta have bad odor with good odor, you know,” Stacey said. “Because if we ain’t got the bad odor, then you might as well forget the good one.”

Nobody headed to the dealership today will be able to take advantage of the $7500 in savings afforded by the tax credit. The situation varied by model, but in many cases, the change meant the effective price for many consumers buying EVs went up $7500 overnight. Automakers understand this to be an unsavory position that’s unlikely to encourage sales, so many of them have taken matters into their own hands. From creative loopholes proposed and cancelled to traditional discounts and all-out vehicle cancellations, there’s a little of everything going on right now,

We thought it might be handy to run through some of the big moves, so keep scrolling to see what automakers are up to in order to keep buyers coming to showrooms and driving off in new electric cars.

Hyundai

Hyundai simply dropped the price of its 2026 Ioniq 5 as a response to the tax credit disappearing. The base model went down $7600, and other trims went down by as much as $9800. That’s not a massive cut in the context of what you would’ve effectively paid with the tax credit, but it sure is preferable to the price staying exactly the same.

Ford and General Motors

Ford and General Motors both thought they had come up with a genius loophole to maintain the tax credit discount for cars on the lot. Both the FoMoCo and GM in-house lending arms were planning to initiate the purchase of EVs in inventory while the credit was still applicable, and then pass those savings onto the customers who would ultimately lease the vehicles. It drew ire from a certain U.S. senator, however, and the plan was quickly put to bed just as rapidly as it was proposed.

The above said, neither Ford nor GM are continuing unchanged. Ford told Road & Track that it will “maintain the competitive lease payments” it offers now and continue to offer 0% financing for 72 months for those who wish to purchase an EV.

Meanwhile, GM has simply promised to “fund the incentive lease terms through the end of October” to keep prices in check for buyers.

Stellantis

Stellantis never joined its crosstown rivals in the tax credit loophole scheme, but it has come through and replicated the savings of the federal tax credit through incentives applied to its EVs. That means EVs like the Dodge Charger Daytona and Jeep Wagoneer S will still be $7500 less than what the sticker says.

Tesla

Tesla went with the intriguing strategy of coming out with new, “Standard” trims of both its Model 3 and Model Y. These models start $5000-$5500 less than the trims above them, but even after removing content and luxuries aplenty, that’s still not enough to completely make up for the $7500 tax credit it loses. (If you’re curious to read about all the details surrounding these Standard trim models, you can find the full story here.)

Honda / Acura

Acura ended production of the ZDX electric SUV with the announcement coming right at the end of September. It was only here for a single year, and Acura’s statement to Car and Driver cites “market conditions” as one of the reasons it’s been eliminated. Consider this one a tangential victim of the tax credit—and for what it’s worth, its Honda Prologue sibling is still trucking along.

Mercedes-Benz

Mercedes-Benz made waves in July when it announced both the EQE and EQS sedans and SUVs would be put on pause in the U.S. All vehicles scheduled for production prior to September 1 were to be produced, but nothing after that would be made for the U.S. market. This timing suggests Mercedes is responding to the EV tax credit disappearing, though the closest that the brand's statements came to saying as much is when it cited “market conditions” as a reason for the pause.

Other EV makers are sticking it out but just shoving money on the hood to try and make up for the tax credit. For example, the refreshed 2026 Subaru Solterra is being offered with a not-so-transparent $7500 lease cash offer.","https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/model-3-standard-hero-desktop-68e677c47b969.jpg?crop=0.445xw:0.457xh;0.275xw,0.443xh&resize=1200:*",N,,2025-10-14 12:13:15.441897

On September 15, 2025, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reinstated a policy from the first Trump administration that the agency would not ""second-guess"" pre-project emissions projections made by permit applicants in New Source Review (NSR) permitting. Specifically, EPA re-issued a 2017 memorandum, titled ""New Source Review Preconstruction Permitting Requirements: Enforceability and Use of the Actual-to-Projected-Actual Applicability Test in Determining Major Modification Applicability.""

Before beginning construction of a project, the Actual-to-Projected-Actual Applicability (APTA) test is utilized to determine whether a proposed project at an existing source triggers NSR permitting by comparing pre-project actual emissions with the projected post-project actual emissions. With the reinstatement of the 2017 policy, EPA is clarifying that ""when a source owner or operator performs a pre-project NSR applicability analysis in accordance with the calculation procedures in the regulations, and follows the applicable recordkeeping and notification requirements in the regulations, that owner or operator has met the pre-project source obligations of the regulations, unless there is clear error (e.g. the source applies the wrong significance threshold)."" As long as the owner or operator complies with the regulatory requirements, EPA will not ""substitute its judgment for that of the owner or operator by 'second guessing' the owner or operator's emissions projections."" The 2017 policy also clarifies that the intent of an owner or operator to manage emissions from a unit after a project is completed is relevant information that may be considered when projecting future actual emissions.

The 6th Circuit's opinion in U.S. v. DTE Energy Co., 711 F.3d 643 (6th Cir. 2013), held that EPA has the authority to pursue enforcement based solely on an allegedly improper projection of future emissions even though actual emissions from the source had not increased. The ""no second-guessing"" policy indicates that as long as an owner or operator makes a good-faith projection about a project's emissions increase (or lack thereof), EPA will exercise its discretion and not pursue enforcement ""unless post-project actual emissions data indicate that a significant emissions increase or a significant net emissions increase did in fact occur.""EPA will look to the actual emissions during the 5- or 10-year recordkeeping or reporting period to assess whether a significant emissions increase has occurred.As such, the policy indicates that EPA will use its substantial discretion to restrict enforcement for mere projection errors that did not result in post-project significant actual emissions increases or significant net increases and will reserve enforcement for matters where post-project actual emissions indicate that an NSR permit is required.

EPA's reinstatement of its ""no second-guessing"" policy comes on the heels of its September 2, 2025, interpretation of ""begin actual construction,"" wherein the Agency previewed its current stance on the topic and signaled its intention to amend the NSR regulations to authorize a broader set of construction activities before (or without) receiving an NSR permit.

Not only has this led to higher energy bills and a longer allergy season, the trend has significantly pushed back first fall freeze dates.
“In fact, of 204 cities analyzed, 88% of them see their first fall freeze happen on average almost two weeks later,” said Climate Central meteorologist Shel Winkley.
From coast to coast, fall is losing some of its familiar chill.
Many crops, including fruits and nuts, depend on a steady stretch of “chill time” beginning in early fall to ensure healthy yields.","ATLANTA — If fall feels a little warmer — and a lot longer — than it used to, you’re not imagining things.

A new study shows every county in the contiguous U.S. has warmed since 1970 due to climate change. Not only has this led to higher energy bills and a longer allergy season, the trend has significantly pushed back first fall freeze dates.

“In fact, of 204 cities analyzed, 88% of them see their first fall freeze happen on average almost two weeks later,” said Climate Central meteorologist Shel Winkley. “In places like Reno, Nevada, and Bend, Oregon, that delay is typically more than a month.”

It’s not only happening in the West. From coast to coast, fall is losing some of its familiar chill.

Climate Central’s study shows Toledo, Ohio’s first freeze is arriving 29 days later on average than in the 1970s; Philadelphia typically sees its first frost 20 days later; and Nashville and New York don’t get frosty until about two weeks later than they used to.

While summer lovers may not see a problem, the consequences can be costly. Later freezes are known to affect health, agriculture and the environment.

“It can stretch allergy season longer, give pests like mosquitoes more time to buzz and thrive, and even reduce the quality of fruit and nut crops that depend on colder temperatures,” Winkley said. “It also affects fall color, farming schedules and local ecosystems.”

The first freeze is more than just a weather milestone — it’s a biological signal. Farmers rely on predictable freeze dates for planting, harvesting and pest control. While a later freeze and longer growing season can mean more time for crops to grow, it also opens up more opportunities for pests and diseases to thrive.

Many crops, including fruits and nuts, depend on a steady stretch of “chill time” beginning in early fall to ensure healthy yields. However, since 1980, Climate Central reports 181 locations have seen this chilling period shrink.

Beyond farms and forests, fall warming throws off the natural timing for birds to migrate and animals to hibernate.

The evidence is clear: Cooler falls are history thanks to climate change. Now, like Mother Nature, we have to find new ways to adapt.",https://media.kcentv.com/assets/CCT/images/eff04cf8-becd-45fd-81bb-62ae7358b042/20251013T205859/eff04cf8-becd-45fd-81bb-62ae7358b042_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-10-14 12:14:14.005851

Today, New York Independent System Operator (NYISO) issued its quarterly short-term assessment of reliability (STAR) report for the state grid. The report predicts possible deficiencies in electricity supply for New York City, Long Island and the Lower Hudson Valley, starting next year and growing through 2030. The report follows the cancellation of two critical transmission projects to serve New York City. For the next few years, new battery storage can supply most or all the identified need, and more electric transmission (particularly into New York City) can solve longer-term issues.

New York leaders have repeatedly failed to follow through on clean energy, storage, and transmission projects that would have supplied New York with abundant, affordable, clean energy. The cancelled 175-mile Clean Path NY transmission line, which was to be built by 2027, would have brought 1,300MW into New York City before 2030. In July, the New York State Public Service Commission abandoned efforts to develop a transmission project to connect multiple offshore wind farms to provide clean energy and meet growing demand. That project could have lowered costs by $40 to $70 billion from 2033 to 2052. That’s on top of the approximately 50,000 MW of mostly clean energy projects stuck in the interconnection queue, which could be built faster and cheaper than new gas.

Instead, NYISO may recommend that dirty, expensive, gas-burning power plants continue to operate in New York City and Long Island. This would be:

Expensive for New Yorkers

Devastating to frontline communities who have borne the brunt of health impacts from harmful pollution in their neighborhoods for decades

Contrary to the state mandates to clean up the energy system to reduce costs and transition to non-emitting sources of energy

Moreover, the report does not support a NYISO executive’s suggestion of a potential need for “several thousand megawatts of new dispatchable generation.” The identified need in the report is resource neutral. Battery storage, transmission, and other cheap, clean resources can address the need. Meanwhile, NYISO’s own rigorous evaluations of resource adequacy reveal that the statewide system has between 192% and 1,250% of the industry-standard protection against loss of load events. NYISO’s quarterly report confirms that resource adequacy criteria are still met.

Earthjustice statement of Liz Moran, New York Policy Advocate:

“If Governor Hochul is truly committed to an affordable energy agenda for New Yorkers, she will respond to this NYISO report with a plan to dramatically accelerate new transmission and battery storage. NYISO’s dangerous suggestion to keep dirty gas-plants operating in New York City and Long Island lacks factual support and not only runs counter to our landmark climate law, but would also harm health and drive up energy prices for all New Yorkers. As the federal administration raises costs for everyday Americans just to benefit the oil and gas industry, New Yorkers are counting on Governor Hochul to exhibit true leadership by building our clean, renewable future – not more fracked gas pipelines or power plants.”",https://earthjustice.org/wp-content/uploads/earthjustice-logo-1200-1.png,N,,2025-10-14 13:02:49.310057

China is seen as dominating the nuclear, solar, and wind power sectors by 2030, according to the report.
Nuclear growth: For nuclear energy, “a new generation of large-scale nuclear reactors is being built in several countries with enhanced features, and small modular reactors are under development,” according to the report.
By 2030, the Asia Pacific region, led by China, “will dominate solar PV, wind and nuclear generation,” the report predicts.
By that time, Asia will have a total of 193 GWe of installed nuclear electricity generating capacity, and Asian capacity will reach 423 GWe by 2050.","Nuclear power is projected to play an important role in market growth, but not as much as solar or wind. China is seen as dominating the nuclear, solar, and wind power sectors by 2030, according to the report.

Main conclusions: The report’s findings show that more than 60 percent of global electricity will come from renewable sources—largely solar and wind, followed by nuclear—by 2030. Data centers could be responsible for driving a 23 percent annual increase in U.S. power needs up to that time.

Three forecast scenarios based on different levels of U.S. government support for climate/clean energy goals are examined, with the findings that in any of these three possible government policy scenarios, energy from clean and renewable sources will surpass traditional sources by 2035 at the latest.

The report also notes that the growth of distributed commercial, industrial, and residential solar photovoltaic (PV) systems, together with pending technological advancements in such areas as battery storage, is creating “new opportunities for downstream players to integrate, manage, and maintain these systems.” These opportunities go beyond the traditional roles of simply delivering and maintaining physical components of the energy grid.

Nuclear growth: For nuclear energy, “a new generation of large-scale nuclear reactors is being built in several countries with enhanced features, and small modular reactors are under development,” according to the report. By 2030, nuclear will account for at least 9 percent of global electricity generation, making for a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 2 percent.

By contrast, solar PV will account for at least 17 percent of global electricity generation (19 percent CAGR), and wind will provide at least 13 percent (10 percent CAGR) by 2030.

Expansion in Asia: The report identifies key drivers of nuclear growth in China, which has committed to increasing its non–fossil fuel energy share to 20 percent by 2030.

By 2030, the Asia Pacific region, led by China, “will dominate solar PV, wind and nuclear generation,” the report predicts. By that time, Asia will have a total of 193 GWe of installed nuclear electricity generating capacity, and Asian capacity will reach 423 GWe by 2050. By contrast, the installed nuclear electricity generating capacity numbers for 2030 and 2050 will be, respectively, 110 GWe and 228 GWe in North America, and 148 GWe and 247 GWe in Europe.

Headwinds in Europe and America: The analysis points out that the European Union “is setting new renewable energy targets for 2040, though these plans face challenges due to differing views on including nuclear power in the renewable energy mix.”

In the United States, half of the nuclear generating capacity is more than 30 years old, and “major investments are required” to boost the nuclear sector, the report states. Another problem hampering the development of domestic energy projects is a slow project permitting process.",https://www.ans.org/file/21911/l/Picture1.jpg,N,,2025-10-14 11:01:27.454647

Shares fell less than 2% before the opening bell Tuesday.

The EV tax credit ended last month. The clean vehicle tax credit was worth $7,500 for new EVs and up to $4,000 for used ones.

Meanwhile, the Environmental Protection Agency has been working on easing rules aimed at cleaning up auto tailpipe emissions as the Trump administration move to undo incentives for automakers to go electric. President Donald Trump has also challenged federal EV charging infrastructure money and blocked California’s ban of new gas-powered vehicle sales. It adds up to less pressure on automakers to continue evolving their production away from gas-burning vehicles.

General Motors, which had led the way among U.S. automakers with plans to convert production to an electric fleet of vehicles, said in a regulatory filing on Tuesday that it will have to book charges that include non-cash impairment and other charges of $1.2 billion due to EV capacity adjustments. There's also $400 million in charges mostly related to contract cancellation fees and commercial settlements associated with EV-related investments.

GM warned that it may take additional hits as it adjusts production, with non-cash charges potentially impacting operations and cash flow in the future.

The company said that its EV capacity realignment doesn't impact its retail portfolio of Chevrolet, GMC and Cadillac EVs currently in production, and that it expects those models to remain available to consumers.

EVs were considered to be the future of the US automotive industry. GM had announced in 2020 that it was going to invest $27 billion in electric and autonomous vehicles in the next five years, a 35% increase over plans made before the pandemic.

In 2021 GM said that it planned to have more than half of its North American and China factories be capable of making electric vehicles by 2030. It also pledged at the time to increase its investment in EV charging networks by nearly $750 million through 2025.

A year later, GM CEO Mary Barra said that the automaker would sell more electric vehicles in the U.S. than Tesla by the middle of the decade. GM also had a goal of making the vast majority of the vehicles it produces electric by 2035, and the entire company carbon neutral, including operations, five years after that.

BluWave-ai’s AI is Foundational to Energy Transition Success

Canada’s drive toward net-zero by 2050 requires a dramatic expansion of storage capacity. By 2030, the country is projected to have as many as 5 million light-duty EVs on the road (Source: NRCan/Dunsky).

To align with climate targets, dedicated Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) capacity will need to rise above 12,000 MW by the end of this decade (Source: Canadian Climate Institute/Navius Research).

The AI platform from BluWave-ai directly addresses the complexity of managing this massive, dual-front energy transition:

Enabling Dispatchable Renewables with the Sunbank Solar Farm(City of Summerside): The Smart Grid Optimizer is deployed for the Sunbank Solar Farm (a joint venture with Samsung Renewables) integrated with Microsoft Azure. The AI deployment allows the utility to deliver clean energy on demand and reducing reliance on traditional peak generation methods around highly variable solar and wind energy.

Maximizing Performance of New Grid-Scale Batteries: The Energy Storage Autopilot AI is being deployed with major partners, including a project with Evolugen, to maximize the lifetime performance, reliability, and financial returns of their grid-scale batteries. This is key to efficiently managing the estimated 4 GW of battery storage planned for the Ontario grid.

Grid Infrastructure Deferment: Collaborations such as with Area X.O, Hydro Ottawa, and Moment Energy use AI to optimize multiple battery systems alongside EVs. This strategy helps defer costly distribution grid infrastructure upgrades, reinforcing the potential for AI-driven digitalization to deliver massive savings (estimated at $1.8 trillion globally by 2050 by the IEA).

“BluWave-ai’s innovative technologies are empowering the global evolution of traditional electrical grids toward more sustainable, efficient, and resilient software-defined smart grids,” added Dr. Thomas Triplet, VP of Technology at BluWave-ai, “Our portfolio covers foundational inventions of AI driven systems management for our utility and transport customers, ensuring our solutions are not just groundbreaking, but also highly effective and scalable in the face of growing energy demands.”

“This award validates our strategy of applying advanced AI, secured by a growing patent portfolio and massive data scale, to every part of the global energy transition,” said Devashish Paul, CEO and Founder of BluWave-ai. “Our technology is designed to make renewable energy more reliable and electric transportation more efficient.

In 2021, GM said that it planned to have more than half of its North American and China factories be capable of making electric vehicles by 2030. It also pledged at the time to increase its investment in EV charging networks by nearly $750 million through 2025.

A year later, GM CEO Mary Barra said that the automaker would sell more electric vehicles in the U.S. than Tesla by the middle of the decade. GM also had a goal of making the vast majority of the vehicles it produces electric by 2035, and the entire company carbon neutral, including operations, five years after that.

Yet U.S. automakers are being hampered in some of their long-term planning, with drastic changes in economic and environmental policy from one administration to the next. The automakers are also facing increased competition from automakers such as China's BYD, which announced in July that its sales grew 31% in the first six months of the year to 2.1 million cars.

BYD's sales have skyrocketed on the back of a government-driven EV boom in China. The rise of BYD and other Chinese electric vehicle makers is a challenge for Tesla and the world's other major automakers as Chinese competitors push into Europe, Southeast Asia and other overseas markets with a relatively affordable option for drivers who want to go green.

Shares fell less than 2% before the opening bell Tuesday.

The EV tax credit ended last month. The clean vehicle tax credit was worth $7,500 for new EVs and up to $4,000 for used ones.

Meanwhile, the Environmental Protection Agency has been working on easing rules aimed at cleaning up auto tailpipe emissions as the Trump administration move to undo incentives for automakers to go electric. President Donald Trump has also challenged federal EV charging infrastructure money and blocked California’s ban of new gas-powered vehicle sales. It adds up to less pressure on automakers to continue evolving their production away from gas-burning vehicles.

General Motors, which had led the way among U.S. automakers with plans to convert production to an electric fleet of vehicles, said in a regulatory filing on Tuesday that it will have to book charges that include non-cash impairment and other charges of $1.2 billion due to EV capacity adjustments. There’s also $400 million in charges mostly related to contract cancellation fees and commercial settlements associated with EV-related investments.

GM warned that it may take additional hits as it adjusts production, with non-cash charges potentially impacting operations and cash flow in the future.

This delivery marks an operational milestone as the Company prepares to begin commissioning its first U.S.-based waste conversion system.

""Our team has been working tirelessly to reach this point,"" said Scott Gallagher, Chairman and CEO of Waste Energy Corp. ""This first feedstock delivery marks the true beginning of our mission - diverting waste that once polluted our landfills and converting it into clean, profitable energy for a sustainable future.""

Turning Waste Into Energy for the AI Age

Every year, millions of pounds of non-recyclable plastic and tires end up in landfills, leaching toxins into the environment. Waste Energy Corp's proprietary waste conversion system is designed to divert and convert this waste into high-value fuels, carbon black, carbon credits and other renewable energy products - generating strong margins while reducing environmental impact.

""As global demand for energy skyrockets - driven by the exponential growth of AI, data centers, and electrification - the world urgently needs new, scalable sources of clean energy,"" continued Gallagher. ""Waste Energy Corp sits at the intersection of two megatrends: environmental sustainability and the accelerating need for power to fuel the age of AI.""

Patent-Pending Blockchain-Based Carbon Credit Automation

In addition to producing clean fuel, Waste Energy Corp is developing a patent-pending blockchain-based carbon credit automation and trading platform that will capture, verify, and monetize emissions data directly from its conversion systems in real time.

The Patent Pending system - built to integrate IoT sensors, AI-driven verification, and blockchain-based transaction records - will enable automated creation and trading of carbon credits generated through the Company's waste diversion and fuel production activities. Each verified ton of emissions reduction will be tokenized and traded on WEC's forthcoming automated carbon credit creation marketplace, offering a new recurring revenue stream with global scalability and enormous ESG value to companies.

""This technology converts every pound of waste we divert from landfills and processes it into not just clean fuel, but measurable environmental value,"" said Gallagher. ""Our automated carbon credit system allows Waste Energy Corp to directly participate in the multi-billion-dollar global carbon markets - creating a financial layer on top of our physical operations.""

Building a Profitable and Sustainable Energy Platform

At full capacity, the Company's Midland facility is expected to process up to 90 tons of waste per day, generating over $10 million in annual revenue with gross profit margins exceeding 50%. Each ton of diverted waste represents both an environmental win and a monetizable resource - transformed into clean diesel and reusable carbon materials rather than buried in a landfill.

""This first feedstock delivery is a reminder of why we built this business - to prove that doing good for the planet and doing well for our shareholders can be the same mission,"" Gallagher concluded.

This summary addresses how EPA’s new approach to the NSR Program might impact stationary source projects.
The court reasoned that CAA Section 165 unambiguously limits NSR permitting requirements only to “construction” that is “commenced after August 7, 1977.” The court additionally held that “construction” within the meaning of the NSR regulations also includes modification.
Therefore, according to the court, NSR permitting requirements apply only to facilities constructed or modified after August 7, 1977, regardless of operational status (e.g., idled, shut down) or operator intent.","The New Source Review (“NSR”) Program under the Clean Air Act (“CAA”) requires new major stationary sources and existing major stationary sources making major modifications to undergo permitting prior to beginning construction; a process that could take several years and result in stringent emissions control technology requirements. Given its scope, the NSR Program may impact the development of a wide range of facilities across various sectors, including power plants, refineries, manufacturing facilities, and data centers, among others. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) recently has announced a suite of policy developments and a forthcoming rulemaking that attempt to clarify when NSR preconstruction permitting is required and could limit the lead time for development of both new facilities and modifications at existing facilities.

EPA’s new NSR policies establish revised interpretations of certain regulatory requirements for preconstruction permitting under the CAA. These developments effectuate the Administration’s ongoing initiatives to simplify and streamline permitting processes and reduce regulatory “red tape” for projects powering advancements in the nation’s industrial and energy sectors. According to EPA, additional NSR guidance and policy developments may follow, as well as a potential rulemaking to codify certain aspects of the Agency’s new approach to preconstruction permitting under the NSR Program.

This summary addresses how EPA’s new approach to the NSR Program might impact stationary source projects.

Withdrawal of Reactivation Policy

On September 18, 2025, EPA issued a memorandum, New Source Review Program “Reactivation Policy” (“Reactivation Memorandum”), announcing that the Agency will no longer apply its longstanding “Reactivation Policy” in permitting and enforcement actions under the NSR Program on a national basis. In a September 15, 2025 press release announcing the Reactivation Memorandum, EPA stated that its new approach should “allow[] for idled facilities like power plants[,] which are desperately needed to provide electricity much faster,” to be brought back into operation under the NSR Program.

Implemented by the Agency under various articulations in guidance and permitting actions since the 1970s, EPA’s Reactivation Policy applied a rebuttable presumption that existing major stationary sources that have “permanently” shut down, or otherwise have been removed from a state’s emissions inventory, but are seeking to restart operations, are considered “new” and therefore subject to the NSR Program. However, the Agency has, at times, expressed skepticism over the Policy’s validity under both the CAA and its NSR Program regulations. Further, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit (“Third Circuit”) recently rejected EPA’s application of the Reactivation Policy to require a preconstruction permit for the resumption of operations at an existing major stationary source previously considered to have permanently ceased operations. See Port Hamilton Refining & Transp. LLLP v. EPA, 75 F.4th 166 (3d Cir. 2023) (“Port Hamilton”). The court reasoned that CAA Section 165 unambiguously limits NSR permitting requirements only to “construction” that is “commenced after August 7, 1977.” The court additionally held that “construction” within the meaning of the NSR regulations also includes modification. Therefore, according to the court, NSR permitting requirements apply only to facilities constructed or modified after August 7, 1977, regardless of operational status (e.g., idled, shut down) or operator intent. As a result of the decision, EPA was precluded from applying the Reactivation Policy within the jurisdiction of the Third Circuit.

EPA now explains in the Reactivation Memorandum that it agrees with the Third Circuit’s interpretation of the CAA. Consistent with Port Hamilton, EPA will no longer apply the Reactivation Policy “to classify resuming operation of a stationary source as construction of a new source in EPA permitting and enforcement actions” or in its “oversight of state, local, and tribal air permitting programs.” EPA intends to implement its new approach on a national basis, which would bring nationwide application of NSR requirements in line with the approach currently in place within the jurisdiction of the Third Circuit. The nationwide application is based on EPA’s determination that the Port Hamilton decision reflects the “best read[ing]” of the CAA, similar decisions in four other U.S. Courts of Appeals on the scope of the CAA’s NSR requirements, and the “strong interest in equal treatment among sources and nationwide uniformity” under the CAA.

EPA encourages state, local, and tribal air agencies to follow its new approach “where doing so is consistent with applicable law in their jurisdictions.” However, the Agency explains in the Reactivation Memorandum that its new policy does not preclude local permitting authorities from implementing local requirements for preconstruction permitting for reactivating idle sources “where those policies … are more stringent than the CAA.” Furthermore, EPA plans to evaluate on a case-by-case basis “the extent to which it is necessary to enforce or revisit its approval of State Implementation Plans” containing requirements based in the now-withdrawn Reactivation Policy or are otherwise “not independently supported by state or local laws.”

Notwithstanding EPA’s new policy, the Agency will continue to apply NSR permitting requirements to modification at sources that have been shut down. Therefore, where an idled source seeks to make modifications to restart operations, the modifications must be analyzed to determine whether they are considered “major modifications” that are subject to the NSR Program.

Revised Interpretation of “Begin Actual Construction”

The NSR Program’s Prevention of Significant Deterioration (“PSD”) and Nonattainment New Source Review (“NNSR”) regulations at 40 C.F.R. §§ 52.21 and 51.165, respectively, require that “[n]o new major stationary source or major modification to which [PSD or NNSR requirements apply] shall begin actual construction without a permit that states that the major stationary source or major modification will meet those requirements.” The phrase “begin actual construction” means, “in general, initiation of physical on-site construction activities on an emissions unit which are of a permanent nature.” 40 C.F.R. §§ 52.21(b)(11), 51.165(a)(1) (emphasis added).

On September 2, 2025, EPA issued a letter to the Maricopa County Air Quality Department (“MCAQD”) clarifying the Agency’s interpretation of these requirements. MCAQD originally sought EPA’s opinion on whether an NSR permit was required prior to the initial stage of construction activities at a semiconductor manufacturing facility, which consisted of construction of the core and shell of a building that would eventually house the emission unit. In the letter, EPA explained that its previous interpretation of the federal NSR regulations adopted “an overly broad reading” of the term “emissions unit,” by construing the term to include “installations necessary to accommodate an emission unit.” According to the letter to MCAQD, EPA now interprets its NSR regulations to allow certain construction activities, such as the construction of the core and shell of a building, to occur prior to issuance of an NSR permit, so long as the construction does not involve “the physical construction on an emission unit” itself or, in accordance with MCAQD’s regulations, “the laying of underground piping or construction of supports and foundations that are part of any emissions unit.”

EPA plans to undertake a rulemaking to codify its new interpretation and clarify which construction activities require or do not require an NSR permit to proceed. According to a September 9, 2025 press release, EPA anticipates that this rulemaking will provide “flexibility to begin certain building activities that are not related to air emissions,” streamline preconstruction permitting, and reduce potential project delays. In the rulemaking, the Agency intends to revise the definition of “begin actual construction” so that it is tied specifically to the construction of the emissions unit itself. The rulemaking also may adopt a narrower definition of “emissions unit.”

According to the Office of Management and Budget’s Spring 2025 Unified Agenda of Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions, EPA expects to issue a proposed rule in January 2026 and a final rule in September 2026.

Reissuance of “No Second Guessing” Memorandum

In a press release issued on September 15, 2025, EPA announced for the first time that the Agency has reissued its December 7, 2017, memorandum, New Source Review Preconstruction Permitting Requirements: Enforceability and Use of the Actual-to-Projected-Actual Applicability (“APTA”) Test in Determining Major Modification Applicability (“2017 Memorandum), also known as the “no second guessing” memorandum. EPA originally issued the 2017 Memorandum to outline the Agency’s intended approach to NSR enforcement for existing major stationary sources undertaking modifications in light of a series of decisions from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit involving certain NSR enforcement actions. The 2017 Memorandum had been rescinded by EPA on December 9, 2022, with no rationale provided.

Now, with the reissuance of the 2017 Memorandum, EPA’s interpretation of the NSR program and its NSR enforcement policy, as discussed in the 2017 Memorandum, are back in effect. In the 2017 Memorandum, EPA explained that it would interpret the NSR regulations to permit the consideration of a project owner’s intent to actively manage future emissions from a proposed project at an existing major stationary source, which would allow the project owner to prevent significant emissions increases from a project that would have to be taken into account when calculating the project’s projected actual emissions.

EPA also explained its view that the NSR rules provide “no mechanism” for the Agency to review a source’s exclusion of emissions that (1) could have been accommodated during the baseline period, and (2) are unrelated to the project. EPA further clarified that owners/operators would be considered to have met their pre-project requirements under the NSR regulations if they performed a pre-project NSR applicability analysis in accordance with the regulations and followed the applicable recordkeeping and notification requirements, “unless there is clear error (e.g. the source applies the wrong significance threshold).” Importantly, EPA stated that it does not intend to pursue enforcement for projects that would result in less than significant emission increases or net emission increases, unless post-project actual emissions data indicated that a significant emissions increase or a significant net emissions increase did, in fact, occur.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.16337_2239.jpg,N,,2025-10-14 13:03:27.094333

He said “We are going to be introducing flex connect, which is a micro-transit service that will have three zones throughout the city. That customers will be able to order the vehicle via the app, website, or call it in and make a reservation.”

Mason also shared that the micro-transit service will also further the agencies goal of giving more people access to public transportation by providing first-mile last-mile assistance to better connect customers to bus stops.

The city will begin rolling out the new buses later this week.

PORTLAND, Maine (AP) — Leaf-peeping season has arrived in the Northeast and beyond, but weeks of drought have muted this year’s autumn colors, and sent leaves fluttering to the ground earlier than usual. Soaking in the fall foliage is an annual tradition in the New England states as well as areas such as the Rocky Mountains of Colorado, Great Smoky Mountains of the mid-south and Upper Peninsula of Michigan. As the days shorten and temperatures drop, chlorophyll in leaves breaks down, and they turn to the autumn tones of yellow, orange and red. But dry weather in summer and fall can change all that because it causes leaves to brown and fall more quickly.

GM to take a $1.6 billion hit as tax incentives for EVs are slashed and emission rules ease

General Motors will book a negative impact of $1.6 billion in its next quarter after tax incentives for electric vehicles were slashed by the U.S. and rules governing emissions are relaxed. Shares dipped 3% before the opening bell Tuesday. The EV tax credit ended last month. The clean vehicle tax credit was worth $7,500 for new EVs and up to $4,000 for used ones. General Motors, which had led the way among U.S. automakers with plans to convert production to an electric fleet of vehicles, warned that more hits may be ahead as it adjust production under a new administration, and non-cash charges may impact operations and cash flow in the future.

Brewers turn potential grand slam by Dodgers slugger Max Muncy into wild double play in NLCS

MILWAUKEE (AP) — Max Muncy came within inches of hitting a grand slam for the Los Angeles Dodgers to open the scoring in the National League Championship Series. Instead, the Milwaukee Brewers turned it into one of the most incredible double plays in postseason history. With the bases loaded and one out in the fourth inning, Muncy hit a long drive to center field. Sal Frelick jumped and reached over the wall in an attempt to make the catch. The ball popped out of Frelick’s glove and hit the top of the fence before Frelick caught it in the air. He fired the ball in, and Brewers catcher William Contreras forced out one runner at home plate and another at third base for a most unusual 8-6-2 inning-ending double play.

California engineer wins pumpkin contest with 2,346-pound gourd

HALF MOON BAY, Calif. (AP) — A California engineer and gardening enthusiast has won the top prize at a pumpkin-weighing contest in Northern California. Brandon Dawson of Santa Rosa clinched victory Monday at the 52nd World Championship Pumpkin Weigh-Off in Half Moon Bay. His giant pumpkin weighed 2,346 pounds. That's roughly the same weight as a small sedan or a large bison. Dawson celebrated by sitting his two children on top of the massive gourd and pumping his arm in the air for photos. He says his 4-year-old son now pays attention to the growing process, especially since giant pumpkins can grow 50 to 70 pounds a day. Dawson, who works at Rivian Automotive, has been growing massive pumpkins for five years.

This Virginia nonprofit is finding out. - Canary Media,Not Available,,,,,https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/solar/agrivoltaics-crops-virginia-pilot-loudoun,"Virginia has more than enough room to meet that target without threatening great swaths of farmland.
Researchers from Virginia Commonwealth University determined that large-scale solar today is erected on less than 1% of the state’s cropland.
With the shade and protection from rainwater that they provide, how do the solar panels affect soil moisture and temperature?
What do vegetables grown beneath and near solar panels look like, and how will consumers react?
But a 2024 survey from the American Farmland Trust found that most Virginia farmers and farmland owners hold nuanced views.","More than a decade ago, residents of Loudoun County, Virginia, banded together to buy up treasured open space before it became a strip mall and housing development, donating the land to the Piedmont Environmental Council instead. The nonprofit has maintained it as a unique blend of cattle pasture, a nature preserve, and a community farm that donates its yield to a local food pantry.

Now, a small corner of the farm has become what organizers say is a first for the state: a crop-based agrivoltaics demonstration project. They hope the combination of solar panels and vegetable farming will showcase how much-needed renewable energy can complement, not harm, agricultural lands, at a time when data centers are demanding more and more electricity.

The Virginia Clean Economy Act requires the state’s largest utility, Dominion Energy, to stop burning fossil fuels by 2045 and to develop 16,100 megawatts of land-based renewable energy by 2035 — mostly in the form of solar.

Virginia has more than enough room to meet that target without threatening great swaths of farmland. Using a conservative metric that 10 acres of land can host 1 megawatt of solar capacity, a Nature Conservancy analysis found that the state has 40 times more suitable land area than needed for solar fields, even after ruling out over 2 million acres of ​“prime conservation lands” including farmland.

Researchers from Virginia Commonwealth University determined that large-scale solar today is erected on less than 1% of the state’s cropland. Under a ​“high-growth scenario,” that figure could rise to 3.1% by 2035, including 1.2% of the state’s federally designated prime farmland. Yet low-density residential development may pose a far greater threat to those spaces, according to research by the nonprofit American Farmland Trust, which advocates for ​“smart solar” that doesn’t jeopardize agricultural land.

In fact, many landowners find that renting a portion of their land to solar companies can help their farming enterprise pencil out financially, reducing pressure to sell their property to developers. An acre of land, after all, may yield hundreds of dollars if devoted to crops but thousands if leased for panels.

And yet there’s no doubt that solar has grown exponentially in the state in the last decade, and that it has disproportionately displaced farmland. Cropland makes up 5% of Virginia’s total acreage but 28% of the land area now used for large-scale solar, the Virginia Commonwealth University researchers found.

Especially in the early years of renewable-energy construction, some companies set a poor example for responsible development, said Ashish Kapoor, senior energy and climate advisor with the Piedmont Environmental Council. ​“It was a little bit ​‘Wild West,’” he said. ​“Those early projects in 2018, 2019 — there were a lot of significant runoff issues.”

As solar fields have gone up at a breakneck pace — replacing plots of forests as well as farmland — opposition to them has also grown. Virginia localities approved 100% of solar projects in 2016, according to reporting from Inside Climate News. By 2024, the approval rate had fallen to under 50%.

The increasing number of rejections stems from a ​“a mix of disinformation and resentment,” Kapoor said. But the tension between solar and farmland is real. ​“That’s a national thing,” he added. ​“It’s everywhere.”

Agrivoltaics — the awkward portmanteau of agriculture and solar photovoltaics — has emerged as a potential solution, wherein farmland is kept in production even while it hosts solar arrays. The most common application is sheep: They graze on vegetation beneath the panels and prevent the need for expensive and polluting mowers. Planting flowers in and around panels to supply honeybees and other pollinators is also popular.

Still, the Piedmont Environmental Council team wanted to experiment with a crop-based model because it fits better with what most farmers in the area are doing now: raising vegetables.

“You want to change as little as possible for the farmer,” said Teddy Pitsiokos, who manages the organization’s community farm.

Occupying a quarter-acre section of the nonprofit’s 8-acre community vegetable farm in Loudoun County, the agrivoltaics project is small by design. It features 42 ground-mounted solar panels with a total capacity of 17 kilowatts, two batteries for backup power during outages, and about 2,000 square feet of growing area.

The array will supply more than enough power to meet the farm’s needs, with additional headroom for a planned EV charger and a greenhouse that organizers want to electrify eventually. But the Piedmont Environmental Council isn’t trying to demonstrate scale. Rather, it hopes to carefully measure impact.

With the shade and protection from rainwater that they provide, how do the solar panels affect soil moisture and temperature? What’s the resulting crop yield? What do vegetables grown beneath and near solar panels look like, and how will consumers react? Do any contents from the panels make their way into the crops, posing health problems?

Most research has found that the answer to the last question is no. But the team still plans to test for contaminants in response to public concern as a show of good faith and transparency, and in an effort to address any potential barriers to agrivoltaics from the get-go.

While most crop-based agrivoltaics projects involve growing produce in the ground, the Piedmont Environmental Council’s farm also includes raised beds, which enable educational tours and widen the demonstration project’s relevance.

The beds do increase costs, said Pitsiokos. But the rationale for them, he said, ​“is so we can create data for people who might be doing this in an urban setting, a parking lot, or on some other nonpermeable surface,” he said. ​“We have productive agricultural soil; not everybody does.”

The experiment could also help inform compliance with new state rules designed to mitigate land loss from solar: Certain developers have to conserve land on a one-to-one basis for projects on prime farmland, but their burden is less if the array is used for agrivoltaics.

Pitsiokos also wants the data to reach educators, policymakers, and cohorts he hasn’t anticipated yet. ​“We want to share it with everybody,” he said, ​“because we know that we can’t predict who might benefit from it exactly.”

Perhaps most of all, the Piedmont Environmental Council hopes the project will reach farmers. Plenty are outspoken on solar, both for and against. But a 2024 survey from the American Farmland Trust found that most Virginia farmers and farmland owners hold nuanced views. Over half would consider solar if they could continue farming under and around the panels, according to the survey, but nearly two-thirds agree that solar developers should be responsible for returning land to a farmable state after an array is decommissioned.

With the project’s first crops of kale getting harvested this month, the Piedmont Environmental Council plans to make real-time data available as soon as this winter, for all to see. But grand conclusions won’t be forthcoming for another two or so years.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/PEC-agrivoltaics-working.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=319535a629b14570943da370daa33ca0,N,,2025-10-14 13:02:58.374053

Gov. Gavin Newsom announced Monday that the vehicles accounted for 29.1% of all light-duty vehicle sales in the state during the third quarter of this year. The California Energy Commission said registrations came to 124,755 between July and September, breaking the previous quarterly sales record of 118,776 zero-emission vehicles, or ZEVs, set in the second quarter of 2023.

“This is unprecedented — we’re nearing a third of all new vehicles sold in the fourth-largest economy on the planet being clean cars,” Newsom in a news release.

“I’m not surprised,” said Ivan Drury, senior manager of auto insights at Edmunds.com. “If there were any a time in which we would see a record for this vehicle type selling, now makes the most sense.”

The sales figures come on the heels of the 940-page federal budget legislation dubbed the “One Big Beautiful Bill” backed by Republicans on Capitol Hill and signed into law in July by President Donald Trump. The package included provisions that eliminated the federal tax credit of up to $7,500 on the purchase or lease of a new EV, or $4,000 for a used one, as of Sept. 30.

Earlier this month, makers of electric vehicles reported boosts in third-quarter sales, as consumers across the country jumped in before the tax credits went away. Rivian, for example, reported a surge of nearly 32% between July and September, and Tesla — the popular maker of EVs in the U.S. — saw a 7% bump in deliveries.

The big question centers on whether the momentum will hold up in succeeding quarters, especially considering California’s aggressive electric vehicle targets and headwinds from the Trump administration.

Five years ago, Newsom issued an executive order mandating the elimination of sales of all new gasoline-powered passenger vehicles throughout California by 2035. But in June, Trump signed three Congressional Review Act resolutions rescinding California’s electric vehicle mandates — as well as rules related to diesel engines.

California and 10 other states have responded by filing a lawsuit, arguing that Trump’s actions are unconstitutional and beyond the authority of Congress.

“While the federal government stumbles backward with reckless rollbacks and short-sighted policies, California charges ahead lighting the path to a cleaner, more prosperous future,” California Air Resources Board Chair Lauren Sanchez said Monday.

Policymakers said the number of publicly available charging stations across the state now exceeds 200,000 and that California just became the first state in the country to adopt standards to improve reliability and enable accurate reporting of EV chargers in operation across the state.

The California Energy Commission in August launched a $55 million incentive program that would subsidize up to 100% of the installation costs for fast-charging stations at businesses and public sites.

It’s all part of the state’s efforts to reduce “range anxiety” — the fear that drivers could get stranded if their EV runs out of power before getting to a charging station — and encourage potential customers to go all-in on ZEVs.

Nationally, electric vehicles make up about 10% to 12% of national auto sales.

Speaking at a conference two weeks ago, Ford CEO Jim Farley said, “I wouldn’t be surprised if EV sales in the U.S. go down to 5%,” adding that while the zero-emission sector will remain a “vibrant industry” going forward, it’s also “going to be smaller, way smaller than we thought.”

Drury of Edmunds.com said automakers “have an existing consumer base now that has a preference for EVs and because of that they’ll move forward. Combine that with the fact that every automaker is global and EVs aren’t going away anytime soon.”

But with the tax credit gone, Drury expects October sales “should be down a bit,” adding that “the jury’s still out” on whether California can hit its 2035 goals.",https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SUT-L-ELECTRICVEHICLES-HYUNDAI-0814-01.jpg?w=1024&h=501,N,,2025-10-14 11:00:46.011884

According to the report, the projected peak demand increase is so significant that it could exceed available supply in the short term.

Brattle says that battery storage can help address this resource inadequacy.

The study assumes that all forecasted demand in PJM’2 2025 Load Forecast Report will materialise, meaning that by 2028, PJM’s summer peak will increase by 16GW, and by 2032, by an additional 30GW.

Interconnection queue backlogs, long wait times for new supply—particularly gas-fired generation, and trade barriers for renewables and storage are expected to constrain PJM’s supply well into the early 2030s.

While efforts have been taken to increase available near-term capacity, PJM’s interconnection process still imposes a multi-year study wait-time.

The report assumes that by 2032, at most, an additional 10GW+ of new gas facilities would be in service.

The report models the PJM system through 2045, using current load growth and cost forecasts, to determine the most cost-effective future resource mix for the region. It then assesses the impact on resource adequacy for PJM by analysing a hypothetical case where battery storage is not an available resource option.

Brattle’s study projects that significant amounts of dispatchable resources, such as storage and gas, will be essential for ensuring resource adequacy and handling weather-related risks in PJM.

The role of energy storage

PJM will require 16 to 23GW of battery storage within the next 7 to 15 years.

This assumes that the market can incorporate more than 17GW of new gas resources by 2032 and postpones nearly all planned thermal retirements to the middle of the next decade.

Battery storage becomes even more essential as the slower deployment of gas resources worsens resource adequacy challenges.

Despite price pressures caused by trade barrier uncertainties, substantial storage remains in PJM’s interconnection queue. This could help compensate if the required firm gas capacity is not developed in time to support large loads by the end of the decade.

Brattle also highlights that storage facilities can be brought into service much faster than gas turbines, due to supply rebalances and backlogged demand.

With battery storage, PJM could prevent up to 15GW of load shedding risk during difficult system conditions in 2032, like extreme cold snaps. Without this, load shedding could lead to planning failures, serious customer impacts, and an unreliable system.

The report states that PJM will need to continue utilising new gas resources and maintaining conventional firm resources through the 2040s; battery storage will help reliably meet the increasing demand in the coming decades.

Notably, Brattle also projects that customer costs could increase by 30% without energy storage deployment.

In July, advocacy organisations Citizens Utility Board (CUB) and Clean Grid Alliance stated that increasing the use of renewable energy and battery storage in Illinois could help reduce the rising costs of capacity market auctions within the PJM Interconnection area.

The prices were 22% higher than in 2024’s auction for capacity in the 2025-2026 delivery year.

In April, Brattle and the American Clean Power Association (ACP) released a report on energy storage market reforms for regional grid operators, including PJM.

Brattle indicated that although storage can engage in PJM’s capacity, energy, and ancillary services markets, outdated regulations prevent it from competing on an equal footing.

The current rules are tailored for traditional generation assets and do not consider the opportunity cost of using energy or saving it for a more valuable time.

(Reuters) -General Motors said on Tuesday it would take a $1.6 billion charge in the third quarter as it reshapes its electric vehicle strategy following the scrapping of a key federal incentive that is likely to dampen demand.

GM's disclosure is one of the clearest indications yet that U.S. automakers are scrambling to adapt their production plans in response to slowing EV demand.

The EV market also faces fresh strain after the Trump administration scrapped a $7,500 federal tax credit for electric vehicles, a key industry support, with auto executives warning of a sharp near-term drop in battery-car sales before an eventual rebound.

EV ADOPTION RATE TO SLOW

In a filing, GM said it expects ""the adoption rate of EVs to slow"" following recent policy changes, including the termination of certain consumer tax incentives and reduced emissions-rule stringency.

""The charge is a special item driven by our expectation that EV volumes will be lower than planned because of market conditions and the changed regulatory and policy environment,"" GM told Reuters in a statement.

Automakers are also working to cushion the impact of President Donald Trump's tariffs, which forced GM to take a $1.1 billion hit in the previous quarter.

The company has estimated a bottom-line impact of $4 billion to $5 billion this year from trade headwinds and said it could take steps to offset at least 30% of the blow.

Shares of the Detroit, Michigan-based automaker were down 2.5% in premarket trading. The stock is up about 4.5% so far this year.

""The charge doesn’t come as a surprise given recent market developments and the fact GM had made probably the most aggressive EV push of any traditional automaker,"" said Garrett Nelson, a senior equity analyst at CFRA Research.

""We think the automakers who chose to invest more heavily in hybrid vehicle development such as Toyota and Honda are poised to benefit in the U.S. auto market.""

Both GM and crosstown rival Ford had launched a program that would have allowed dealers to offer a $7,500 tax credit on EV leases after the federal subsidy expired, before walking back on those plans.

The automaker warned of possible further charges as it reassesses capacity and manufacturing footprint.

The changes will, however, not affect GM's current portfolio of its Chevrolet, GMC and Cadillac EVs that are in production.

Charges include a $1.2 billion non-cash impairment tied to EV capacity adjustments and $400 million for contract-cancellation fees and commercial settlements.

GM said the charges will be recorded as adjustments to non-GAAP results for the third quarter, scheduled for early next week.

Zevo Will Deploy Faraday Future’s Next-generation Automobiles Across World’s First Peer-to-peer EV Sharing Marketplace

This partnership further validates our mission — to make EV access and ownership attainable for more people.”

— Hebron Sher, Co-founder and CEO of Zevo

DALLAS, TX, UNITED STATES, October 14, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- Zevo, the world’s first peer-to-peer EV sharing platform, today announced it has signed a strategic partnership with Faraday Future (NASDAQ: FFIE) to bring 1,000 of the automaker’s next-generation electric vehicles, FX Super One, onto its network. The agreement establishes Zevo as a co-creation partner and represents one of the largest real-world fleet EV allocations by a peer-to-peer network. The development also helps diversify Zevo’s fleet mix — reducing dependency on Tesla models — and marks a major milestone in making advanced EVs more accessible to communities nationwide.

Under the partnership, Zevo plans to make the majority of the vehicles available through its community of independent hosts, providing drivers the opportunity to access the cars immediately and, over time, transition toward ownership. The model builds on Zevo’s mission to create alternatives to high-cost rental programs by aligning vehicle access with long-term equity for the people who power the platform. The remainder will be operated directly by Zevo in select test markets.

“This partnership further validates our mission — to make EV access and ownership attainable for more people,” said Hebron Sher, Co-founder and CEO of Zevo. “By working with Faraday Future, we’re not just putting more EVs on the road. We’re creating a fairer model where drivers can earn, drive and ultimately work toward owning the vehicles they rely on.”

“Partnering with Zevo puts FF Super One into real-world service immediately,” said YT Jia, Founder & Co-CEO of Faraday Future. “High-mileage use across diverse driving conditions gives us market penetration, visibility, feedback and customer familiarity — everything you want in an effective go-to-market strategy.”

With Zevo cars averaging more than 5,000 miles driven per month, the partnership ensures Faraday Future’s vehicles will see significant real-world use while empowering drivers to earn income through the platform. For many, consistent use of Zevo can also open the door to financing opportunities and longer-term ownership — an alternative to high-cost rental or subscription models that often leave drivers without equity.

The first vehicles are expected to be delivered over the next 12–18 months, with deployment beginning in key Zevo markets including Texas, California, Arizona, Florida and Nevada.

Shares fell less than 2% before the opening bell Tuesday.

The EV tax credit ended last month. The clean vehicle tax credit was worth $7,500 for new EVs and up to $4,000 for used ones.

Meanwhile, the Environmental Protection Agency has been working on easing rules aimed at cleaning up auto tailpipe emissions as the Trump administration move to undo incentives for automakers to go electric. President Donald Trump has also challenged federal EV charging infrastructure money and blocked California’s ban of new gas-powered vehicle sales. It adds up to less pressure on automakers to continue evolving their production away from gas-burning vehicles.

General Motors, which had led the way among U.S. automakers with plans to convert production to an electric fleet of vehicles, said in a regulatory filing on Tuesday that it will have to book charges that include non-cash impairment and other charges of $1.2 billion due to EV capacity adjustments. There’s also $400 million in charges mostly related to contract cancellation fees and commercial settlements associated with EV-related investments.

GM warned that it may take additional hits as it adjusts production, with non-cash charges potentially impacting operations and cash flow in the future.

The company said that its EV capacity realignment doesn’t impact its retail portfolio of Chevrolet, GMC and Cadillac EVs currently in production, and that it expects those models to remain available to consumers.

EVs were considered to be the future of the US automotive industry. GM had announced in 2020 that it was going to invest $27 billion in electric and autonomous vehicles in the next five years, a 35% increase over plans made before the pandemic.

In 2021 GM said that it planned to have more than half of its North American and China factories be capable of making electric vehicles by 2030. It also pledged at the time to increase its investment in EV charging networks by nearly $750 million through 2025.

A year later, GM CEO Mary Barra said that the automaker would sell more electric vehicles in the U.S. than Tesla by the middle of the decade. GM also had a goal of making the vast majority of the vehicles it produces electric by 2035, and the entire company carbon neutral, including operations, five years after that.

Yet U.S. automakers are being hampered in some of their long-term planning, with drastic changes in economic and environmental policy from one administration to the next. The automakers are also facing increased competition from automakers such as China’s BYD, which announced in July that its sales grew 31% in the first six months of the year to 2.1 million cars.

BYD’s sales have skyrocketed on the back of a government-driven EV boom in China. The rise of BYD and other Chinese electric vehicle makers is a challenge for Tesla and the world’s other major automakers as Chinese competitors push into Europe, Southeast Asia and other overseas markets with a relatively affordable option for drivers who want to go green.",https://fox59.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/10/68ee4140cc7876.98548548.jpeg?w=1280,N,,2025-10-14 17:06:40.623088

The United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) addressed in a September 11th Order a Petition for Objection to a Title V Operating Permit for the Neville Chemical Company filed by Environmental Integrity Project and three other organizations. See Petition No. III-2024-22.

The other three organizations joining the Petition included:

Clean Air Council

PennFuture

Food & Water Watch

(Collectively, “EIP”).

The September 11th Order is styled:

ORDER GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN PART A PETITION FOR OBJECTION TO A TITLE V OPERATING PERMIT (“Order”).

Neville is stated to operate a manufacturing facility in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania that manufactures:

Synthetic hydrocarbon resins

Plasticizers.

Plasticizing oils (used in coatings, adhesives, ink, roofing, and rubber).

Title V of the Clean Air Act requires certain stationary sources of air pollution to obtain Operating Permits. States that administer Title V do so through adopted implementation plans. Those plans are submitted to and approved by EPA.

The intent of a Title V Permit is to organize into a single document all of the requirements that apply to the Permit holder. 42 U.S.C. § 7661 requires that states submit each proposed Title V Permit to EPA for review. Section 505(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act requires that EPA object to the issuance of a proposed Title V Permit in writing within 45 days of the receipt of the proposed Permit (and all necessary supporting information) if the agency determines it is not in compliance with the applicable requirements of the Clean Air Act.

If EPA does not object to a Permit, Section 505(b)(2) provides that any person may petition the EPA Administrator within 60 days of the expiration of the 45-day review period to object to the Permit.

EIP’s section of the Petition titled “Grounds for Objection” includes four claims addressing the Title V Renewal Permit. The claims include:

Claim 1. The Petitioners Claim That “The Renewal Permit fails to include adequate testing, monitoring, recordkeeping, or reporting requirements sufficient to assure continuous compliance with the hourly and long-term emission limits for PM, NOx, SOx, CO, VOC, and HAPs from P001 (heat polymerization stills and thermal oxidizer).”

EPA grants in part and denies in part this claim and objects to the issuance of the permit. EPA rejects EIP’s challenge to the temperature monitoring methodology which argues that the Allegheny County Health Department (“ACHD”) should rely exclusively on temperature as an indicator of performance. In contrast, the Title V Permit for PM and SOx is held by EPA to not add additional conditions to assure compliance with such limits (e.g., through fuel use monitoring and emission calculations based on emission factors. EPA requests that ACHD amend the Permit to ensure that it contains sufficient requirements to assure compliance with the hourly and annual emission limits for PM and SOx on the thermal oxidizer.

Claim 2. The Petitioners Claim That “The Renewal Permit fails to include adequate testing, monitoring, recordkeeping, or reporting requirements sufficient to assure continuous compliance with the hourly and long-term emission limits for PM, CO, VOCs, SOx, and NOx at Boilers No. 6 and 8 (B013 and B012 respectively).”

EPA grants this Petition claim and objects to the issuance of the Permit. The federal agency references the testing and monitoring requirements in the Permit, but states it is not clear if any of these methods are individually or collectively adequate to assure compliance with the emission limits. ACHD is directed to amend the Permit and and permit record as necessary to ensure that the Permit assures compliance with the hourly and annual emission limits for the referenced air pollutants from Boiler No. 6 and Boiler No. 8.

Claim 3. The Petitioners Claim That “The Renewal Permit fails to include adequate testing, monitoring, recordkeeping, or reporting requirements sufficient to assure continuous compliance with the hourly and long-term emission limits for PM, NOx, CO, VOCs, HAPs, and SOx at the six Still Process Heaters (B001, B002, B003, B004, B015, and B006) and the three Packaging Center Heaters (B009, B010, and B011).”

EPA grants this Petition claim and objects to the issuance of the Permit and states that EIP demonstrated that the Permit fails to require adequate monitoring to assure compliance with the hourly and annual emission limits for the referenced air pollutants from the heaters. Further, ACHD’s Permit record is stated to not provide a rationale for the Permit’s lack of monitoring requirements. ACHD is directed to amend the Permit to ensure that the Permit contains sufficient requirements to assure compliance with the hourly and annual emission limits for the referenced air pollutants from the six still process heaters and three packaging center heaters.

Claim 4. The Petitioners Claim That “The Renewal Permit fails to include adequate testing, monitoring, or reporting requirements sufficient to assure continuous compliance with the hourly and long-term emission limits for VOCs and HAPs at Unit 20/21 (P006) and the #3 Continuous Still (P008).”

EPA denies EIP’s request for an objection on this claim. EPA notes that EIP is correct that neither the Permit nor the RTC explain the relationship between the parameters and emissions or how to calculate emissions using the recorded parameters. However, the Neville facility’s TSD is stated to do so. Referenced are tables describing operating scenarios, operating parameters, heat-up parameters, equations, and example scenarios as well as sample calculations for VOC and HAP emissions for each emission unit.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15833_1120.jpg,N,,2025-10-14 12:12:33.315888

The automakers are also facing increased competition from automakers such as China's BYD, which announced in July that its sales grew 31% in the first six months of the year to 2.1 million cars.

BYD’s sales have skyrocketed on the back of a government-driven EV boom in China. The rise of BYD and other Chinese electric vehicle makers is a challenge for Tesla and the world’s other major automakers as Chinese competitors push into Europe, Southeast Asia and other overseas markets with a relatively affordable option for drivers who want to go green.

We found that companies with more patent families tend to release less of their toxic waste to the environment.
Those owned by smaller companies, with less than 1,000 employees, release an average of 42% of their toxic chemical waste to the environment.
We also found that industrial facilities owned by profitable firms have higher average rates of releasing toxic chemicals to the environment than those owned by unprofitable companies.
Facilities owned by companies with negative net income released an average of 31% of their toxic chemical waste to the environment.","How much pollution a facility engaged in production or resource extraction emits isn’t just based on its location, its industry or the type of work it does. That’s what our team of environmental and financial economists found when we examined how corporate characteristics shape pollution emissions.

Pollution emissions rates also vary with specific characteristics of the company that owns the facility – such as how many patents it holds, how profitable it is and how many employees it has, according to an analysis we have conducted of corporate pollution data.

We found that industrial and mining facilities owned by profitable companies with relatively few patents and fewer employees tend to release higher proportions of their toxic waste into the environment – into the air, into water or onto soil.

By contrast, industrial sites owned by unprofitable companies with higher levels of innovation and more personnel tend to handle higher proportions of their toxic waste in more environmentally responsible ways, such as processing them into nontoxic forms or recycling them, or burning them to generate energy.

Corporations publish their pollution data

A 1986 federal law requires companies that are in certain industries, employ more than 10 people and make, use or process significant amounts of certain toxic or dangerous chemicals to tell the government where those chemicals go after the company is done with them.

That data is collected by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in a database called the Toxics Release Inventory. That data includes information about the companies, their facilities and locations, and what they do with their waste chemicals.

The goal is not only to inform the public about which dangerous chemicals are being used in their communities, but also to encourage companies to use cleaner methods and handle their waste in ways that are more environmentally responsible.

Overall, U.S. companies reported releasing to the environment 3.3 billion pounds of toxic chemicals (1.5 billion kg) in 2023, a 21% decrease from 2014. The decline reflects increased waste management, adoption of pollution prevention and cleaner technologies, in addition to the fact that disclosure requirements motivate companies to reduce releases.

The 2023 releases came from over 21,600 industrial facilities in all 50 states and various U.S. territories, including Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam and American Samoa. One-fifth of the facilities reporting toxic releases in 2023 were in Texas, Ohio and California.

What kinds of businesses release toxic pollution?

Metal mining, chemical manufacturing, primary metals, natural gas processing and electric utilities represent the top five polluting industrial sectors in the U.S. Combined, businesses in those sectors accounted for 78% of the toxic chemicals released in 2023.

Research has found that, often, higher levels of toxic chemical releases come from industrial facilities in less populated, economically disadvantaged, rural or minority communities.

But geography and population are not the whole story. Even within the same area, some facilities pollute a lot less than others. Our inquiry into the differences between those facilities has found that corporate characteristics matter a lot – such as operational size, innovative capacity and financial strength.

In our analysis, we combined the data companies reported to the EPA about toxic chemical releases with financial information on those companies and ZIP-code level geographic and demographic data. We found that corporate characteristics like profitability, employment size and number of patents are more strongly connected with toxic chemical releases than a community’s population density, minority-group percentage or household income.

We looked at what percentage of its toxic chemical waste a facility or mine released to the environment versus how much it treated, recycled or incinerated.

The average facility in our sample, which included 1,976 facilities owned by companies for which financial data is available, released about 39% of its toxic chemical waste to the environment, whether to air, water or land – with the remaining 61% of it managed through recycling, treatment or energy recovery either on-site or off-site.

But facilities in different industries have different release rates. For example, about 99% of toxic chemicals from coal mines are released to the environment, compared with 81% for natural gas extraction, recovery and processing; 25% for power-generating electric utilities; and less than 3% for electrical equipment manufacturers.

The role of innovation

One corporate attribute we examined was innovation, which we measured by counting corporations’ patent families, which are groups of patent documents related to the same invention, even if they are filed in different countries. We found that companies with more patent families tend to release less of their toxic waste to the environment.

Specifically, facilities owned by the top 25% of companies, when rated by innovation, released an average of 32.5% of their toxic waste to the environment, which is 8 percentage points lower than the average of facilities owned by the remaining companies in the sample.

We hypothesize that innovation may give firms a competitive advantage that also enables them to adopt cleaner production technologies or invest in more environmentally conscious methods of handling waste containing toxic chemicals, thereby preventing toxic chemicals from being directly released to the environment.

Size and profitability matter, too

We also looked at companies’ size – in terms of number of employees – and their profitability, to see how those connected with pollution rates at the facilities the company owns.

We found that larger companies, those with more than 19,000 employees, own facilities that release an average of 31% of their toxic chemical waste to the environment. By contrast, facilities owned by midsized companies, from 1,000 to 19,000 workers, release 45%, on average. Those owned by smaller companies, with less than 1,000 employees, release an average of 42% of their toxic chemical waste to the environment.

An important note is that those larger companies, which are more likely to have multiple locations, often own facilities that handle larger volumes of chemicals. So even if they release smaller proportions of their toxic waste to the environment, that may still add up to larger quantities.

We also found that industrial facilities owned by profitable firms have higher average rates of releasing toxic chemicals to the environment than those owned by unprofitable companies.

Facilities owned by companies with positive net income, according to their income statements obtained from PitchBook, a company that collects data on corporations, released an average of 40% of their toxic-chemical-containing wastes to the environment. Facilities owned by companies with negative net income released an average of 31% of their toxic chemical waste to the environment. To us, that indicates that financially strong companies are not necessarily more environmentally responsible. That may be evidence that profitable firms make money in part by contaminating the environment rather than paying for pollution prevention or cleanup.

Our analysis shows that geography and demographics alone do not fully account for industries’ and facilities’ differing levels of pollution. Corporate characteristics are also key factors in how toxic waste is handled and disposed of.",https://images.theconversation.com/files/695222/original/file-20251008-64-dvv70r.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C500%2C6000%2C3000&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,N,,2025-10-14 12:12:38.006564

The pullback comes despite a recent jump in EV sales, driven in part by consumers rushing to take advantage of tax credits before they expired.","General Motors Co. is incurring $1.6 billion in charges related to paring back electric-vehicle production plans, underscoring the toll on US carmakers from flagging federal support for plug-in vehicles.

Non-cash impairment and other charges totaling $1.2 billion are the result of adjustments to EV capacity, GM said Tuesday in a regulatory filing. The rest of the costs relate to canceling contracts and settling commercial arrangements linked to EV investments and will have a cash impact.

GM warned the reassessment of its EV manufacturing footprint is ongoing and that it’s “reasonably possible” it will recognize more charges that hurt its results in quarters to come. The automaker’s shares fell 3.3% before the start of regular trading in New York.

Automakers have been recalibrating their EV investment and production plans as President Donald Trump’s policies inject volatility into the US car market. The administration eliminated EV tax credits at the end of last month and has effectively nullified fuel economy and emissions standards, enticing companies to sell more profitable gasoline-powered vehicles and make fewer EVs.

“Following recent US government policy changes, including the termination of certain consumer tax incentives for EV purchases and the reduction in the stringency of emissions regulations, we expect the adoption rate of EVs to slow,” GM said in the filing.

GM’s stock rose 4.4% this year through Monday’s close, trailing the 13% advance in the S&P 500 Index.

GM announced last month it would relaunch the Chevrolet Bolt EV in December with one shift of production at its plant in Kansas, a reduction from its earlier plan for two shifts. The company also has scheduled downtime in December at a Tennessee factory where it builds the Cadillac Lyriq and Vistiq EVs, and will cut output to one shift from January through May.

The automaker said at the time that it was “making strategic production adjustments in alignment with expected slower EV industry growth and customer demand.”

The moves echo those of rival Ford Motor Co., which has delayed or scrapped some plug-in models and reallocated dollars away from its money-losing EV business. The automaker took a $1.9 billion hit last year linked to canceling plans for an electric sport utility vehicle.

Since then, the outlook for EVs has grown even more uncertain. Ford Chief Executive Officer Jim Farley said last month that the EV market will be “way smaller than we thought” as Trump’s policies push consumers toward gas-powered vehicles.

The pullback comes despite a recent jump in EV sales, driven in part by consumers rushing to take advantage of tax credits before they expired. GM’s third-quarter US sales rose 8%, led by electric vehicle deliveries that doubled to more than 66,000 cars and trucks.

,American Energy,2025-10-14 12:47:09+00:00,www.woodmac.com,The impact of China's new critical mineral export controls - Wood Mackenzie,Ed Crooks,,,,,https://www.woodmac.com/blogs/energy-pulse/impact-of-chinas-new-critical-mineral-export-controls/,"In an escalation of the trade dispute between China and the US, Beijing last week moved to tighten export controls for rare earths and other critical minerals and technologies, particularly for batteries.
And while previous controls on rare earths focused primarily on materials, the latest restrictions also cover components such as magnets, and equipment for recycling.
Under successive administrations, the US has been taking measures to develop alternative sources of supply for rare earths and battery materials.
The same is true of many other critical minerals: lithium, for example.
“China has been working consistently on these critical minerals for many decades,” says Julian Kettle, Wood Mackenzie’s Vice-Chairman of Metals and Mining.","China recognised the strategic importance of its rare earths industry back in the early 1990s. Deng Xiaoping, the former leader, said in 1992: “The Middle East has its oil, China has rare earths… it is of extremely important strategic significance.” That strategic vision is still paying off today.

In an escalation of the trade dispute between China and the US, Beijing last week moved to tighten export controls for rare earths and other critical minerals and technologies, particularly for batteries. Its dominance of global supply chains for those materials means that its moves could have far-reaching impacts on industries including defence and semiconductors, as well as battery storage and electric vehicles.

The package of measures includes new controls on five rare earth elements that are crucial in medical and telecoms applications, as well as some military uses. And while previous controls on rare earths focused primarily on materials, the latest restrictions also cover components such as magnets, and equipment for recycling.

The battery-related controls are even more wide-ranging, covering cathode and anode materials, high-performance components, and manufacturing equipment.

President Donald Trump responded swiftly, saying the US would impose additional tariffs of 100% on all imports from China on 1 November. Over the weekend, however, he stepped back from that confrontational stance, posting: “Don’t worry about China, it will all be fine!... The USA wants to help China, not hurt it!!!” Stock markets, which had fallen sharply on Friday, rebounded on Monday.

Under successive administrations, the US has been taking measures to develop alternative sources of supply for rare earths and battery materials. Chris Wright, the energy secretary, in August announced nearly US$1 billion of funding opportunities for projects to develop and scale up mining, processing, and manufacturing technologies for critical minerals.

The Department of Defense has also been stepping up its purchases of critical minerals, with recent orders worth a total of more than US$1 billion for cobalt, antimony, tantalum and scandium, among other materials.

Some moves to secure US domestic supplies are already under way. The Department of Defense in July agreed a deal to support MP Materials, which owns the Mountain Pass rare earths mine in California, processing facilities, and manufacturing plants for metals and magnets.

The US government made investments that would make it the company’s largest shareholder, agreed to buy all the magnets produced at MP’s new factory for at least ten years, and set a guaranteed price floor for its rare earth products.

The Trump administration also took 5% stakes in Lithium Americas and in the Thacker Pass lithium mine in Nevada that the company is developing in a joint venture with General Motors.

The private sector has also been stepping up. JPMorgan on Monday launched what it described as a US$1.5 trillion security and resiliency initiative: a 10-year plan to facilitate, finance and invest in key strategic industries, including critical minerals.

China’s latest moves have been widely seen as a negotiating tactic, intended to create leverage before President Trump meets President Xi Jinping at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in South Korea at the end of October. If a deal can be done there, the new restrictions may be lifted quickly.

Scott Bessent, the US Treasury secretary, said on Monday that there had been substantial communication between the two countries over the weekend, and the US had “de-escalated” the situation.

However, he suggested that the dispute underlined the importance of reducing US dependence on China.

“We don’t want to decouple. But China, when they send out messages like this, this is a decoupling message,” he said.

The Wood Mackenzie view

The first thing everyone learns about rare earths is that they are not actually particularly rare, in terms of their distribution of deposits around the world. The same is true of many other critical minerals: lithium, for example. But that does not mean that diversifying away from Chinese supplies will be easy.

China dominates global supply chains for these materials not because it holds the largest resource base for primary supplies, but because it has invested in technologies and capacity to process, refine and use them.

“China has been working consistently on these critical minerals for many decades,” says Julian Kettle, Wood Mackenzie’s Vice-Chairman of Metals and Mining. “The industry had a lot of failures, but they learned from them. They kept trying and trying again.”

In the US and other developed economies, minerals processing capacity has been lost and knowhow dispersed when companies were hit by downturns in the market. In China, these sectors have benefitted from consistent government support.

In the developed world, environmental regulations and community opposition have made it difficult and expensive to expand operations. In China, environmental regulations have still allowed industries to grow.

Creating the right economic, political and social framework to allow critical minerals companies to invest and expand in developed countries will take time and money. The US deal with MP Materials is a step in the right direction, but more will be needed to develop complete supply chains in all the relevant sectors.

Perhaps the toughest point for other countries to accept is that China has much of the world’s best technology and capabilities for materials processing. “It’s quite a sobering moment for the West to have to go to China to say: ‘can you show us how to it?’ But in many sectors that’s the reality,” says Wood Mackenzie’s Kettle.

“If other countries want best-in-class technology, they are going to have to work with Chinese companies.”

However, the Trump administration and other US politicians are generally deeply sceptical about partnerships between American and Chinese companies. Japanese and South Korean companies also have materials processing capabilities, but have faced challenges with investment in the US.

If China’s latest export restrictions are maintained, they will also make it harder to build alternative supply chains in other countries. The details vary from product to product, but in general, delayed approvals for equipment exports will slow the commissioning of non-Chinese plants.

Secretary Bessent says the US drive to establish its own critical minerals industry is “the equivalent of Operation Warp Speed”: the first Trump administration’s highly successful programme to develop vaccines for Covid-19.

The US is unlikely to be able to establish full supply chains for rare earths and battery raw materials that quickly. But unless it and other countries start to make the effort, critical minerals will continue to represent important strategic leverage for China.

A setback for the largest solar project in North America

The Trump administration has blocked what would have been the largest solar development in North America: the 6.2 gigawatt Esmeralda Seven project in Nevada. A statement on the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) website described the project, which would have covered about 62,300 acres, as “cancelled”. However, there are signs that one or more of the project’s seven phases could still go ahead.

The Department of the Interior said in a statement that the developers, which include NextEra and Invenergy, could still “submit individual project proposals to the BLM to more effectively analyse potential impacts” of individual phases.

The BLM suggested that it could “consider authorising an amendment” to the resource management plan for the area to allow solar installations. It added that the Environmental Impact Statement for the plan should “further analyse generally the expected impacts [from the project] and develop required future mitigation.”

NextEra said it remained “committed to pursuing our project’s comprehensive environmental analysis by working closely with the Bureau of Land Management.”

In brief

Oil prices have dropped to their lowest levels since May, on fears that the flare-up in trade tensions between China and the US could hit global growth. Brent crude was trading at about US$63.40 a barrel on Monday night.

Ming Yang of China plans to invest £1.5bn in Scotland to build the UK’s largest wind turbine manufacturing plant. The company’s UK chief executive said it aimed to “make this country the global hub for offshore wind technology.”

“These data centers should be outfitted with power generation capabilities, whether it’s natural gas or in the future – several years from now – nuclear. We should invest in just about every possible way of generating energy. And then even put it back onto the grid. And so that’s the future. And data center self-generated power could move a lot faster than putting it on the grid.”

The Emancipation Proclamation was an executive order issued by President Lincoln, not an act of Congress.
President Teddy Roosevelt used an executive order to save the Grand Canyon and create 150 national forests.
Any executive order issued by one president can be undone by an executive order signed by his successor, as Trump has repeatedly done for Joe Biden.
But they all serve one purpose: to expand the powers of the president and weaken the powers of Congress.","Sometimes the title of a book says it all. And that’s the case with a just-released collection of essays by the late, great David McCullough: “History Matters.”

In the book’s first two sentences, McCullough tells us why: “History tells us how to behave. History teaches, reinforces what we believe in, what we stand for, and what we ought to be willing to stand up for.” Making no effort to understand our history, McCullough adds, “isn’t just ignorant, it’s rude. It’s a form of ingratitude.”

But one thing about history: those who are living through historic times aren’t necessarily aware of it. In the last century, Americans who made the transition from a manufacturing economy to a service economy didn’t decide to make history. They just needed jobs, and they went where the new jobs were.

By the same measure, most Americans today don’t realize that we’re witnessing an historic change in governance: the disappearance of the U.S. Congress as a meaningful and essential institution. It didn’t happen overnight, but we are getting close to the point where Congress doesn’t matter anymore.

Seriously, when was the last time you remember Congress passing any significant legislation? Monumental achievements like Medicare, the Clean Air Act, the Voting Rights Act, or the Civil Rights Act, aren’t possible anymore. This 119th Congress, like the last few sessions, is incapable of probing, debating, and resolving such weighty issues. It can’t even manage its most basic job of keeping the government running.

Sadly, history will show that nobody seized Congress or stole away its authority. Its wounds are self-inflicted. Through laziness, lack of courage, or sheer party loyalty over what’s best for the nation, members of Congress gradually ceded their powers, starting with the power to declare war.

The Constitution is clear: Under Article 1, Section 8, only Congress has the power to declare war. Yet Congress has not exercised that power since World War II. In 1950, President Harry Truman bypassed Congress and ordered U.S. military intervention on the Korean peninsula. Since then, every American war — Vietnam, Gulf War, Afghanistan, and Iraq — has been launched by a president. Congress has ceded its war-making power to the president and is unlikely ever to get it back.

This year, Congress made another huge concession, voluntarily surrendering what is perhaps its most-prized responsibility: control of federal spending. Again, the Constitution is clear. Only Congress has the power of the purse. A president cannot refuse to spend money already appropriated by Congress — unless it cedes that power to the president, which it has.

In July, the Republican-controlled House and Senate voted to let President Trump rescind $9 billion in funding for foreign aid and public broadcasting already approved by Congress. Even though $9 billion is just a small slice of the overall federal budget, Forbes magazine called it a “tectonic shift” in the balance of powers and one that Congress may soon regret. Because, again, once having ceded ultimate power over spending to the White House, they may never get it back.

But, as historian Douglas Brinkley recently revealed in a speech to the White House Historical Association, it is by issuing executive orders that presidents have most persistently eroded the power of the legislative branch. It is a practice used by every president since George Washington for some of the most important measures ever taken by the U.S.

The Emancipation Proclamation was an executive order issued by President Lincoln, not an act of Congress. President Teddy Roosevelt used an executive order to save the Grand Canyon and create 150 national forests. President Franklin Roosevelt used it to shape the New Deal, launch the Manhattan Project and force the internment of Japanese-Americans. Truman used it to desegregate the Armed Forces. President Kennedy used it to create the Peace Corps.

President Trump, of course, is especially fond of executive orders. He signed 26 on his first day in office alone and continues to sign more of them, with flourish, almost every day. But, with a total of 209 signed as of Oct. 9, he has a long way to go to beat the 3,721 signed by FDR.

Executive orders have one fatal flaw: They’re not permanent. Any executive order issued by one president can be undone by an executive order signed by his successor, as Trump has repeatedly done for Joe Biden. But they all serve one purpose: to expand the powers of the president and weaken the powers of Congress.

So much for the balance of powers designed by James Madison. Who needs Congress anymore?",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/10/AP25283800029173.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-10-14 12:11:50.173814

Cohen, Chris Cioffi",,,,,https://news.bgov.com/daily-tax-report/shutdown-could-dampen-congress-bipartisan-tax-extender-appetite,"“But this does kind of sour the soup.” Extenders Left Behind Congress has perennially passed what’s known as an extenders package, renewing mostly bipartisan expired and expiring tax breaks.
Partisan rancor endures after Republicans enacted their tax law using maneuvers to sidestep Democrats, and the White House rescinded already appropriated federal funds.
The House last year passed a $78 billion bipartisan business and child tax break bill and a year later voted to create treaty-like tax benefits to firms operating in Taiwan.
Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) hopes to include her bill extending that break in any tax package that materializes this year, according to a spokesperson.
But he said hasn’t talked with his Republican colleagues about a broader package as the House remains in recess amid the shutdown.","Race tracks, film studios, and other businesses are in line to face higher taxes next year if lawmakers are unable to bridge the partisan rift widening on Capitol Hill.

The nearly two-week old shutdown that’s led to furloughs of thousands of federal workers hinges in part over looming expiration of an enhanced premium tax credit for health plans purchased on exchanges created by the Obama-era health care law.

But other bipartisan tax credits are also expiring. Their backers hope a year-end deal averts those cliffs but acknowledge the dearth of trust between the parties amid the shutdown bodes poorly.

“I’ll work with anybody on legislation that’s good for the American people and my district,” said Rep. Mike Thompson (D-Calif.), the ranking member on the Ways and Means Committee’s tax subcommittee who co-sponsored a permanent extension of the race car break. “But this does kind of sour the soup.”

Extenders Left Behind

Congress has perennially passed what’s known as an extenders package, renewing mostly bipartisan expired and expiring tax breaks. Many of these, such as the expired credit for American Samoan tuna canneries, were left out of Republicans’ July mega law, leaving their fate to the whims of lawmakers considering a raft of issues in bipartisan legislation before the calendar turns.

Partisan rancor endures after Republicans enacted their tax law using maneuvers to sidestep Democrats, and the White House rescinded already appropriated federal funds.

Popular support for each extender break individually may be insufficient to overcome that strife, said Ray Beeman, who leads EY’s Washington Council practice.

Because lawmakers’ terms aren’t expiring this year, they may feel that waiting until 2026 and extending the breaks retroactively is more attractive, Beeman said. The funding lapse has also fractured the attention of lawmakers and their staff, dimming the prospects of planning a package.

“At least, while there’s a shutdown, I just don’t think anybody’s super focused on” other extenders, Beeman said.

There’s been little, if any, substantial negotiation over a year-end package.

Rep. Richard Neal (D-Mass.), the ranking member of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee, told reporters his discussions with Committee Chair Jason Smith (R-Mo.) about such a deal have been minimal.

Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), the ranking member of the tax-writing Senate Finance Committee, said he “will work with anybody to try to find common ground.” But he dinged the panel’s chair, Sen. Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) for skipping a committee debate and vote on Republicans’ tax law despite his calls for “regular order.”

Spokespeople for Smith and Crapo did not return requests for comment.

The House last year passed a $78 billion bipartisan business and child tax break bill and a year later voted to create treaty-like tax benefits to firms operating in Taiwan. That’s giving some lawmakers reason to think an extenders deal is possible.

“We’ve shown that even in a pretty hyperpartisan environment, we were able to come together,” said Rep. Lloyd Smucker (R-Pa.), a senior member of the Ways and Means and Budget committees.

Employer, Film Studio Tax Breaks

One extender at stake is the Work Opportunity Tax Credit, which benefits employers who hire veterans, felons, the disabled and other disadvantaged groups. Smucker is pushing for an expansion of that bonus, arguing it ends up saving money as workers contribute to the Treasury.

The ability of film and TV studios, theaters, and sound recording studios to quickly write off their expenses also faces expiration. Lobbyists for the entertainment industry have sought to extend a long-standing benefit that allows such productions to immediately take advantage of depreciation rules that would normally have to wait for their work to premiere to claim.

Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) hopes to include her bill extending that break in any tax package that materializes this year, according to a spokesperson. Sen. Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.), who has co-sponsored her bill, also wants to get it across the finish line.

“I disagree with her on almost everything, but here we finding a way to sing from the same song sheet,” he said.

Tax writers representing motorsports speedways are also hoping to preserve the tax treatment of race tracks used by operators big and small, including NASCAR.

“If any bill has a tax title, you see if you can insert it into the larger package,” said Sen. Todd Young (R-Ind.), who represents the home of the Indy 500. “I’m imagining it’ll be a year-end play.”

Speedway operations don’t qualify for the taxpayer subsidies that other major league sports often get, and the industry is hoping they can avoid an expiration or at least apply the break retroactively next year so they stay on a level playing field with amusement parks and golf courses.

“The only thing that makes me feel good is that we’ve been in these positions before,” said Dean Aguillen, a principal at OGR who lobbies for the Automobile Competition Committee for the United States, the trade association for the motorsports industry.

Thompson, who has co-sponsored the House companion to Young’s motorsports bill, too hopes it can be included in a year-end package.

But he said hasn’t talked with his Republican colleagues about a broader package as the House remains in recess amid the shutdown.

“I just walked the halls this morning, can’t find a single one,” Thompson said.",https://db0ip7zd23b50.cloudfront.net/dims4/default/6f9b989/2147483647/strip/false/crop/3994x1539+3+356/resize/960x370!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbloomberg-bna-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ffa%2F25%2Fef1344864aa4b11e5ffa7d366415%2F430123371.jpg,N,,2025-10-14 13:03:11.938499

But there are big energy and environmental risks | WVXU,Michael Copley,,,,,https://www.wvxu.org/news-from-npr/2025-10-14/data-centers-are-booming-but-there-are-big-energy-and-environmental-risks,"Data centers are big buildings that house computer hardware to store and process digital information.
With money flooding in, developers are flocking to areas where a lot of data centers are already, like Northern Virginia's Data Center Alley and parts of Texas, according to the IEA.
And in Arizona, some cities have restricted water deliveries to facilities that use a lot of water, including data centers.
Compounding the concerns of data centers' environmental and economic impacts is frustration that tech companies aren't forthcoming about their operations.
Diorio says data center companies are trying to be ""responsible partners"" in the communities where they operate.","Google recently courted the township of Franklin, Ind., so that it could construct a giant campus to house the computer hardware that powers its internet business. But the company needed to rezone more than 450 acres in the Indianapolis suburb, and residents weren't having it.

Many were concerned the facility would consume huge amounts of water and electricity while delivering few local benefits. When a lawyer representing Google confirmed at a September public meeting that the company was pulling its data center proposal, cheers erupted from sign-waving residents.

Similar fights are happening around the United States. On one side are companies pouring billions of dollars into data centers, which increasingly are being built to support artificial intelligence models that promise to transform how people live and work. On the other side are residents who worry the construction spree will have dire consequences for the environment, power prices and surrounding communities.

How tech companies and government officials handle those concerns will shape the industry's future in the U.S. and the country's competitiveness, according to analysts and academics who track the AI industry.

Local opposition ""slowing down the development of the industry or distributing it in sort of weird regional patterns is probably the most overlooked potential outcome in this conversation,"" says Joseph Majkut, director of the energy security and climate change program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

Here's what you need to know about the data center and AI boom — and what's at stake.

What are data centers?

Data centers are big buildings that house computer hardware to store and process digital information. They essentially function as the backbone of the internet. Some of the largest cover more than a million square feet — the size of more than 17 football fields.

When you read this story, or send an email or transfer money from your bank account online, you're relying on data centers scattered around the world.

And that computing power has a big environmental footprint. A typical AI data center uses as much electricity as 100,000 households, and the largest under development will consume 20 times more, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). They also suck up billions of gallons of water for systems to keep all that computer hardware cool.

Why am I hearing so much about data centers right now?

Data centers have been around for decades. But there's an investment frenzy around AI right now that's fueling a construction boom.

That growth is being driven by AI investors seeking enormous profits, thanks to the rising interest in AI from individual consumers and businesses. Within two years of ChatGPT's launch in 2022, for example, around 40% of households in the U.S. and United Kingdom reported using AI chatbots, according to the IEA. Roughly the same share of large companies were using AI last year, up from around 15% in 2020, the agency said.

Tech companies are spending hundreds of billions of dollars on data centers and AI computer chips. They're betting that more people and businesses will use the technology in the future. By 2027, AI is expected to account for 28% of the global data center market, according to Goldman Sachs, more than double its current share.

Where are data centers being built?

With money flooding in, developers are flocking to areas where a lot of data centers are already, like Northern Virginia's Data Center Alley and parts of Texas, according to the IEA. But the agency said there are also signs that development is spreading into other markets, like Las Vegas, that offer affordable land, cheap electricity from renewable power plants and industry tax incentives.

The Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis said this month that ""a potential data center boom is just getting started"" in its district, which covers Minnesota, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota and parts of Michigan and Wisconsin.

""It definitely feels like we are starting to see the rollout of what these massive investments in data centers are potentially going to start to look like on the ground,"" says Melissa Scanlan, director of the Center for Water Policy at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.

What are the benefits of AI?

Artificial intelligence generally refers to computer systems that learn to carry out tasks that traditionally required human intelligence, like reasoning and decision-making, according to NASA.

Some AI is being used to make images and videos online. The IEA says it's also being deployed in the medical field, to rapidly map protein structures for drug development; in the energy industry to quickly detect pipeline leaks and manage electricity networks; and in weather forecasting, to produce more accurate outlooks.

To remain competitive, the U.S. needs to be able to respond to what the market demands, whether it's ""more AI in the form of robotics, or we want much more in the form of digital services to make professionals more productive,"" says Majkut of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""Then there's a variety of applications in the national security, cybersecurity realm where the U.S. having a strong lead in the best [AI] models, the best chips, I think, is also something we want to pursue.""

Does it matter if the data centers that train and run those AI models are located in the U.S.? There are certainly potential economic benefits, like construction jobs and local tax revenue. But some localities are giving up a portion of those payments by offering tax breaks to lure project developers.

""Because much of the upfront investment is about physical infrastructure, having that investment here is hugely beneficial to the American economy,"" says Andrew Chien, a professor of computer science at the University of Chicago and a senior scientist at Argonne National Laboratory. The challenge for communities is figuring out how to turn those initial investments into long-term benefits, Chien adds, like high-paying jobs.

Since it doesn't take many people to operate a data center, once they're built, the facilities don't usually support many permanent jobs.

What's driving the local pushback against data centers?

Some people don't want huge industrial facilities — and all the noise and light that comes with them — changing the character of their community.

But people are also concerned about data centers depleting local water supplies for their cooling systems, driving up electricity bills and worsening climate change if the facilities rely on fossil fuel power plants for the electricity they need. The IEA says climate pollution from the power plants that run data centers could more than double by 2035.

Consider what's happening around the Great Lakes, where Scanlan of the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee says there's a flurry of data center activity. The Great Lakes can be thought of as ""a giant pitcher of water with straws going into it"" from water utilities, business and power plants in eight states and two Canadian provinces, Scanlan says. The question is, how much more water can the lakes provide for data centers and the power plants needed to run them in the coming years?

In Georgia, some residents reported problems getting drinking water from their wells after a data center was built nearby. And in Arizona, some cities have restricted water deliveries to facilities that use a lot of water, including data centers.

Dan Diorio, vice president of state policy at the Data Center Coalition, an industry group, says companies have been working to reduce how much water their facilities consume. While some data centers use evaporative cooling systems in which water is lost as steam, others rely on closed-loop systems that use less water. A Google data center in Georgia uses treated wastewater for cooling and then returns it to the Chattahoochee River, Diorio said. And there's a push for waterless cooling systems.

""It's a balance between water and electricity,"" Diorio says. ""If you use more electricity to cool, you're going to use less water. If you use more water, you'll use less electricity.""

Rising electricity bills are also a major concern as data centers spike power demand in certain areas. An analysis by the Union of Concerned Scientists recently found that in 2024, homes and businesses in Illinois, Maryland, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and West Virginia faced $4.3 billion in additional costs from transmission projects that were needed to deliver power to data centers.

Diorio says the data center industry ""is fully committed to paying its full cost of service for electricity.""

Data centers aren't the only source of new power demand. The construction of factories and increased sales of electric vehicles and home appliances like electric stoves are also increasing the country's electricity needs.

Compounding the concerns of data centers' environmental and economic impacts is frustration that tech companies aren't forthcoming about their operations. Without more transparency around water and energy consumption, Scanlan says the public doesn't have the information it needs to make informed decisions about data center development.

Diorio says data center companies are trying to be ""responsible partners"" in the communities where they operate. But they sometimes worry that sharing information about their water and energy use could give rivals a competitive edge.

Are there other challenges to data center development?

The big challenge is having enough electricity to meet rising demand.

The Trump administration has been taking steps to limit development of renewable energy projects. Industry executives and analysts say renewables are crucial to boost power supplies because the projects can be built quickly, and they generate electricity that is relatively cheap.

Pavan Venkatakrishnan, an infrastructure fellow at the Institute for Progress, says there's a ""clear conflict"" between the administration's position on renewables and its desire to accelerate data center construction.

A White House spokesperson, Kush Desai, said in a statement that AI ""cannot be beholden to unreliable sources of energy that must be heavily subsidized to be economical. The Trump administration is focused on unleashing the forms of energy — from natural gas to nuclear — that do work and that do not need consistent government subsidies to power the next Golden Age for America.""

Solar and wind power coupled with large batteries to store electricity are reliable power sources. There's also widespread agreement among energy analysts and executives that natural gas and nuclear will play an important role in meeting new electricity demand. But they say those technologies can't be deployed quickly enough at scale right now to meet the country's immediate needs.

In Poland, where electricity generation remains heavily reliant on coal, Apple has supported Econergy’s 40 MW solar array, set to come online later this year.
Apple and its suppliers currently support more than 19 gigawatts (GW) of renewable energy capacity globally, powering both corporate operations and manufacturing facilities.
By 2030, Apple expects its European renewable portfolio to contribute around 3,000 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of clean electricity to the region’s grids each year.","The projects, along with a recently completed solar farm in Spain, will add a total of 650 megawatts (MW) of clean electricity generation capacity to European power grids over the coming years.

The company said the new infrastructure will generate more than one million megawatt-hours (MWh) of renewable electricity annually by 2030, with about $600m in financing committed to support the projects.

The expansion of renewable energy is part of Apple’s plans to counteract emissions from product use, meaning the electricity consumed when customers charge and power their devices. This category represented about 29% of Apple’s total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in 2024.

The company aims to match all electricity used by customers globally with clean energy by the end of the decade. This is part of Apple’s broader goal to reach carbon neutrality across its operations and product lifecycle by 2030.

Apple’s vice president of environment, policy and social initiatives, Lisa Jackson, said: “By 2030, we want our users to know that all the energy it takes to charge their iPhone or power their Mac is matched with clean electricity.

“Our new projects in Europe will help us achieve our ambitious Apple 2030 goal, while contributing to healthy communities, thriving economies, and secure energy sources across the continent.”

More about the projects

In Greece, Apple has signed a long-term agreement to buy energy from a 110 MW solar project owned by HELLENiQ ENERGY, which is now operational.

In Italy, the company is supporting a 129 MW portfolio of solar and wind projects, with the first installation, a solar array in Sicily, expected to begin operations this month.

In Poland, where electricity generation remains heavily reliant on coal, Apple has supported Econergy’s 40 MW solar array, set to come online later this year.

In Romania, the company has arranged to purchase power from Nala Renewables’ 99 MW wind farm now under construction in Galați County.

Apple has also signed a long-term power purchase agreement in Latvia with European Energy for one of the country’s largest planned solar farms, adding 110 MW of capacity once operational.

In Spain, a 131MW solar project developed by ib vogt in Segovia became operational earlier this year.

Apple and its suppliers currently support more than 19 gigawatts (GW) of renewable energy capacity globally, powering both corporate operations and manufacturing facilities.

In 2021, CEO Mary Barra set out ambitious plans for GM to be electric-only by 2035. Four years later, the Chevrolet owner is joining many of its rivals in rolling back its EV plans and investing in hybrids and gas-powered vehicles.

In the regulatory filing, GM said it expects the adoption rate of electric vehicles to slow in the US due to the scrapping of the $7,500 tax credit and the Trump administration's loosening of clean air regulations.

The company previously announced a $4 billion investment plan that will see it boost production of gas-powered SUVs and trucks in the US.

The charges, which GM expects to be recognized this quarter, include $1.2 billion stemming from adjustments in the company's EV capacity and $400 million in cancellation fees and settlements.

GM's share price was down nearly 2% premarket on the news.

Electric Vehicle Council CEO Julie Delvecchio said the findings highlight growing consumer confidence and policy impact.
“More Australians are steering towards electric vehicles because they are better for your budget, better for the climate, and better for Australia whether or not you drive an EV,” Delvecchio said.
“Australia is moving from the early adopters to the early majority where consistent policy support is crucial to sustaining EV growth,” Ms Delvecchio said.","Australia’s electric vehicle (EV) market has reached new milestones in sales, model availability and charging infrastructure, but continued growth will depend on sustained government and industry support, according to the State of EVs 2025 report released by the Electric Vehicle Council (EVC).

The report found Australians purchased 72,758 battery and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles in the first half of 2025 – a 24.4 per cent increase on the same period last year – lifting EVs to 12.1 per cent of all new car sales. Despite the progress, EVs still make up just 2 per cent of all vehicles on Australian roads.

Australia’s national EV fleet now exceeds 410,000 vehicles as of September 2025, with 153 EV models available to consumers – up from 123 a year earlier – following the introduction of the federal government’s New Vehicle Efficiency Standard.

Charging infrastructure also expanded, with 1,272 fast-charging locations and 4,192 high-power public charging plugs recorded nationwide, representing growth of 20 and 22 per cent respectively.

Electric Vehicle Council CEO Julie Delvecchio said the findings highlight growing consumer confidence and policy impact.

“More Australians are steering towards electric vehicles because they are better for your budget, better for the climate, and better for Australia whether or not you drive an EV,” Delvecchio said.

“In just one year we’ve seen electric vehicles reach record highs, high-power charging locations increase at pace, and dozens of new EV models hit the roads.”

However, the report cautions that stronger measures are needed to keep Australia on track to meet its emissions reduction targets.

The EVC estimates the country will need at least one million EVs on the road before 2028, requiring more than 700,000 additional sales over the next three years.

“Australia is moving from the early adopters to the early majority where consistent policy support is crucial to sustaining EV growth,” Ms Delvecchio said.

“We are making inroads in EV uptake as a nation, but the road ahead is steep. We need to shift gears from steady to more rapid growth in EV uptake to meet emissions reduction targets.”

The EVC’s report also assessed government performance, giving the federal government the highest rating (8 out of 10) for its EV policies, while Queensland, Tasmania and the Northern Territory scored the lowest (3 out of 10).

Ms Delvecchio said continued collaboration between governments and industry would be key to maintaining momentum.

“No country has reached mass EV adoption without sustained government support, so withdrawing it now risks stalling the momentum we desperately need,” she said.

“Industry also has a role to play, including developing local battery manufacturing and recycling, upskilling the workforce, and raising EV awareness.”",https://www.australianmanufacturing.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/AdobeStock_477989315.jpeg_Aliaksandr-Marko.jpg,N,,2025-10-14 12:11:23.720599

The announcement came shortly after former President Joe Biden took office pledging to boost EV sales.

The Detroit automotive giant was one of the first to go big on EVs, announcing in 2021 that it would phase out gas and diesel cars globally by 2035. The announcement came shortly after former President Joe Biden took office pledging to boost EV sales. At one point it was planning to spend $30 billion on EVs by this year, including an all-electric lineup further down the track.

Now, things look very different. President Donald Trump ended federal tax credits that helped American buyers afford to buy expensive U.S.-made electric cars last month, while Chinese automakers have pulled off one of the fastest industrial takeovers in modern history by building about 70% of the world's EVs this year.

GM said Tuesday that about $1.2 billion of the charges were down to adjusting its EV capacity, but added that plans to address its manufacturing footprint are “ongoing”. That means it is “reasonably possible” that more costs could be on their way.

The other $400 million is down to cancelled contracts and settling other commercial arrangements linked to its EV investments, it said. Shares were down 1.6% in premarket trading.

“Following recent U.S. Government policy changes, including the termination of certain consumer tax incentives for EV purchases and the reduction in the stringency of emissions regulations, we expect the adoption rate of EVs to slow,” GM said in the filing.

GM said last month that it plans slower output of the Chevrolet Bolt, and is also scaling back producing its Cadillac Lyriq and Vistiq, saying at the time that it is “making strategic production adjustments in alignment with expected slower EV industry growth and customer demand.”

Ford has also cut investment, dropping models and taking a $1.9 billion charge last year. Chief executive Jim Farley recently said the market will be “way smaller than we thought.”

The Congress is the premier global forum for setting the agenda for protected and conserved areas. It brings together leaders and experts from governments, civil society, Indigenous Peoples, academia and the private sector to develop and advance solutions for nature conservation involving effective area-based conservation.

Since the last Congress in 2014 in Sydney, Australia, biodiversity loss, climate impacts, social injustice and inequality, conflict as well as socio-political fragmentation have worsened, according to IUCN:

“Effective and equitable protected and conserved areas have a significant role to play; they conserve biodiversity, address inequity in society and can make a significant contribution to addressing global challenges. The IUCN World Protected and Conserved Areas Congress 2027 will take place in the final years of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework, coinciding also with the 2030 endpoint for the Sustainable Development Goals, and will be uniquely positioned to inform and set the agenda for the ensuing decades.”

For the first time, the Congress will be held in the Mesoamerica region, itself home to astonishingly diverse biodiversity, conserved by governments, civil society as well as Indigenous Peoples and local communities.

Panamanian Minister of the Environment and Climate Change Juan Carlos Navarro said:

“Panama is the crossroads of the world.? A natural land-bridge between North and South America and the Caribbean and Pacific Oceans, with exceptional biodiversity and the planet’s best example of sustainable development:? the Panama Canal.

Those barriers are the only thing keeping Chinese EVs out of American driveways right now.
They just create more hurdles for American automakers already losing ground in every market that matters.
The only thing that can stop Chinese EV makers now is themselves — and their own government.
Chinese companies have two more years to flood global markets before Ford's cheaper truck arrives.","A version of this article originally appeared in Quartz’s members-only Weekend Brief newsletter. Quartz members get access to exclusive newsletters and more. Sign up here.

Chinese automakers have pulled off one of the fastest industrial takeovers in modern history, building 70% of the world's electric vehicles and selling cars so advanced that Ford's CEO spent six months driving a Chinese EV instead of his own company's products. American executives call it an existential threat. But they're running out of time to do anything about it.

The gap between Chinese and American EVs keeps widening even as both sides struggle. Ford announced in August that it's finally adopting manufacturing techniques that China mastered years ago, but it still won't have a competitive $30,000 electric truck until 2027. The federal tax credits that helped American buyers afford the currently much more than $30,000 EVs? Ended last month by a Trump administration that's supposed to be protecting Detroit.

China's EV makers face their own crisis. BYD, the Chinese automaker that dethroned Tesla as the world's top EV seller last year, saw a monthly sales drop for the first time in 18 months in September. It's not alone: China's auto industry is grappling with massive overcapacity, with more than half of its production capacity sitting idle. Beijing, meanwhile, is cracking down on the price wars that fueled growth.

Even with those issues, Chinese manufacturers dominate — and the gap isn't just about price. When Ford CEO Jim Farley test-drove a Xiaomi SU7 last year, he was blown away by what $30,000 buys in China: a sedan that accelerates faster than many Porsches, with a giant touch screen that controls your house lights and a built-in AI assistant. ""It's fantastic,"" he said on a podcast. ""I don't want to give it up.""

In March, BYD unveiled five-minute charging that delivers 250 miles of range and an assisted driving system called ""God's Eye."" American EVs, by comparison, typically need 30 minutes of charging to get a similar range and still feel like regular cars that happen to be electric. Even Tesla's Elon Musk acknowledged the threat last year, saying Chinese automakers would ""pretty much demolish most other car companies in the world"" without trade barriers.

Those barriers are the only thing keeping Chinese EVs out of American driveways right now. The Biden administration imposed 100% tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, and the Trump administration has gone further, adding 54% tariffs on all Chinese goods and gutting EV tax credits that helped American buyers afford electric cars.

""As the words came out of Trump's mouth, they were probably drinking champagne in BYD headquarters,"" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives told the New York Post after Trump's tariff announcement earlier this year. Ives said the trade taxes could cost U.S. auto brands as much as $100 billion per year while BYD gains room to expand in Europe, Mexico, and South America.

The irony is that Trump is trying to defeat a market that has already won. One in four cars sold globally this year will be electric, according to the International Energy Agency. But the Trump administration has frozen funding for EV charging infrastructure, eliminated the $7,500 federal tax credit for EV purchases, and spent months vilifying electric vehicles while boosting oil companies.

Trump’s policies won't stop the rest of the world from shifting to EVs. They just create more hurdles for American automakers already losing ground in every market that matters. And Washington's tariff wall won't hold forever. ""I don't know what the timeframe is, but I don't think we can say 'no, they're not going to come to the U.S.,'"" Ford's John Lawler told analysts in May.

The only thing that can stop Chinese EV makers now is themselves — and their own government. The domestic market, with about 50 manufacturers, is running out of buyers even as those companies compete with more and more price cuts. After five years of growth, BYD's sales fell 10% between May and August as Beijing cracked down on price wars and forced companies to pay suppliers faster. The solution? Go even harder on exporting. BYD now forecasts overseas sales will hit 20% of deliveries in 2025, up from under 10% in 2024.

The race isn't over, but the gap keeps growing. Chinese companies have two more years to flood global markets before Ford's cheaper truck arrives. American automakers risk being shut out of the electric future, not because they can't compete, but because by the time they're ready to try, the rest of the world will already be driving Chinese EVs.

Washington's tariffs won't change that. They'll just make sure Americans are the last to know what they're missing.","https://qz.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=300,quality=85,format=auto/https://assets.qz.com/media/byd_tesla_china_evs.jpg",N,,2025-10-14 09:00:32.156508

President Donald Trump has made his distaste for wind and solar known in speeches and posts on social media, as well.","(CNN) — The Trump administration’s cancellation of the largest solar project in the United States has sparked confusion and concern among Republicans and Democrats alike.

Known as the Esmerelda 7, the collection of seven solar projects in rural Nevada was set to generate up to 6.2 gigawatts of energy when complete, enough to power 2 million homes. That’s an eye-popping amount of power to add to an electrical grid that desperately needs more of it, due to the insatiable demand from AI-related data centers and increasing residential needs.

Under former President Joe Biden, the federal government was moving the sprawling project through the federal permitting process as one proposal. Developers had planned to use 118,000 acres of federal land in Nevada’s desert as the home for solar arrays and batteries to store the sun’s energy.

Last week, the Interior Department’s Bureau of Land Management quietly changed the project’s status to “canceled” on its federal permitting webpage. An Interior Department spokesperson said the status change was unrelated to the ongoing government shutdown and that project developers and the federal government had agreed to “change their approach” as part of “routine discussions” about the project.

There may still be a path forward for the Esmerelda 7; the Interior spokesperson said developers “will now have the option to submit individual project proposals to the BLM” for approval. However, environmental impact analyses can drag on for months or years, making the approval process much longer. And the federal government can also cancel individual projects again.

The project’s cancellation was first reported by Heatmap News.

Although the project was greenlit by the Biden administration, it remained controversial with some conservation groups and residents, who feared the sheer size of the solar arrays would impact critical desert wildlife habitat.

Desert tortoises and Joshua trees live in the area that would be developed for the solar array, said Erik Molvar, executive director of the Western Watersheds Project.

“It doesn’t make sense to trade off gains in climate while sacrificing biodiversity,” Molvar said. “We don’t see the conversion of vast areas of public land to renewable energy as the right solution to the climate crisis.”

NextEra Energy, one of the developers involved, said they “remain committed” to pursuing the project “and will continue to engage constructively” with the Bureau of Land Management, according to company spokesperson Neil Nissan.

The move to pull the plug on the project’s permitting approvals drew rare criticism from politicians of both parties.

“This is how we lose the AI/energy arms race with China,” Utah’s Republican Gov. Spencer Cox posted on X. “Solar with batteries can now be close to baseload power and we should keep these projects rolling until we get the gas/nuclear/geothermal plants we need.”

Nevada’s two Democratic senators blasted the move and urged Interior Sec. Doug Burgum to clarify the project’s future.

“The Trump Administration’s lack of transparency around wind and solar projects has caused chaos and confusion,” Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto said in a statement, adding solar has been a major economic driver in her sunny state.

“Nevada is a national leader in solar energy as the state with the most solar jobs per capita, and the Trump Administration’s attack on this industry will have dire effects on our economy,” added Sen. Jacky Rosen in a statement.

While the Trump administration has largely targeted wind projects via a series of stop work orders and cancellations, it has also created additional hurdles for solar projects to get through federal review. Earlier this year, Trump and congressional Republicans effectively killed tax credits for wind and solar projects, dramatically shortening the timeline during which developers could claim the credits.

An independent analysis from think tank Energy Innovation released this summer showed killing the tax credits would further raise US household energy bills over the next decade.

Since 2022, retail electricity prices have increased faster than the rate of inflation, according to the US Energy Information Administration, which predicts prices will continue to rise through next year. Electricity prices are Americans’ second biggest annual energy expense, after paying for gasoline to fuel their vehicles, the EIA found.

WWF's Panda Ambassador program is a great fit for me, allowing me to keep my day job and still have an impact.","The Panda Ambassador program is the ultimate next level of engagement for those committed to saving wildlife and the environment while supporting WWF. Your enthusiasm, ideas, and unique perspective, plus our worldwide reach and expertise, equal an unstoppable force for good. Together we can make a real, lasting impact on the future of our planet.

Panda Ambassadors are on the frontlines of environmental activism, leading their communities to engage the public and inspire real change. Panda Ambassadors host fun and educational events and activities, lead groups in marches and protests, and meet with politicians and business leaders.

We’re always looking for people who are ready to lead an environmental movement today, and who might just be leading the country tomorrow. If you think you’ve got what it takes, apply today.

Educate

The first step to behavior change is education. As a Panda Ambassador, you’ll explain to others how environmental issues can affect their lives, why they should care, and what they can do to help. Panda Ambassadors give presentations, host and attend events, and have one-on-one chats with community leaders. As an ambassador for WWF in your community, you will demonstrate the local relevance of global issues like climate change, wildlife crime, and food scarcity. You’ll also help people understand how their individual actions, behavior, and purchases have a global impact.

Inspire

Creating a better world doesn’t have to be a chore. Panda Ambassadors inspire people to care about the planet by having fun and connecting on a deeper level. It’s your creativity, new ideas, and enthusiasm that will make the most difference. Some ambassadors engage the public through works of art, creative and persuasive writing, hosting athletic activities like yoga or running, or even hosting parties with music and dancing. You are encouraged to leverage your talents and interests, whatever they may be, to attract others and get them involved.

Lead

Panda Ambassadors are the on-the-ground leaders of a new environmental movement, responsible for drumming up the local support that allows WWF to achieve big wins. You’ll lead your community’s participation in international WWF initiatives like Earth Hour and climate marches. You’ll coordinate support for changes in policy, laws, and business practices. You’ll stand up for your community—be it a college campus or an entire city—and lead it toward a more sustainable, Earth-friendly future.

Jennifer Tribble | Durham, N.C.

Why did you decide to apply to the Panda Ambassador program?

Before applying to the program, I followed WWF’s projects and advocacy work. In particular, I appreciate the work that WWF does bridging science to effective advocacy and environmental work across the world. When I saw the Panda Ambassador program, which was an opportunity to engage locally and raise awareness around some of WWF’s priority projects, I knew I wanted to be a part of that group.

What do you think is the most important thing people can do to help save the planet?

Vote! Find candidates and propositions that support environmental protections, and use your vote to elect representatives who will fight for our planet and our natural resources.

What gives you hope for the future?

I have a lot of hope for the future! One thing that gives me hope is seeing the younger generation standing up to fight for our planet and sustainability. There are so many kids doing inspirational and groundbreaking things, whether that’s fighting through legal battles, doing advocacy work, or starting their own companies. I am also inspired by the number of companies, large and small, that are shifting toward more sustainable products and manufacturing methods.

Jessica Miles | McLean, Va.

Why did you decide to apply to the Panda Ambassador program?

Being a Panda Ambassador has been an empowering experience that I am grateful to be a part of. I would encourage anyone who is looking to do more to help make the world better to apply to the program.

What have you done as a Panda Ambassador that you are most proud of?

Participating in Lobby Day this year was incredibly rewarding for me. I never really pictured myself getting an opportunity like that. I really enjoyed listening to presentations on how to tell our story, meeting other Panda Ambassadors, and practicing the day before we met with our representatives.

What do you think is the most important thing people can do to help save the planet?

When it comes to the environment, it’s easy to feel overwhelmed and paralyzed at the sheer magnitude of what we’re facing. But doing something that feels manageable (even if it seems small and ridiculous) can be impactful. If you’ve never worked out in your life, you don’t wake up one morning and go run a marathon. You build up to it. Sometimes painfully slowly. The same is true about taking action on the environment.

What gives you hope for the future?

I’d say it’s more like determination than hope. Given everything happening both abroad and domestically, it’s a lot to handle. Plus, I think if you are just blindly hopeful about the future, you’re not really paying attention. But that's not a reason to stop fighting. The only thing I can give is everything I’ve got—and I think a healthy, sustainable planet is worth fighting for.

Steven Zampieri | New York, N.Y.

Why did you decide to apply to the Panda Ambassador program?

After months of watching the US government take a regressive approach on environmental issues (including its stance on fossil fuels, national parks funding, and the Paris climate accord), I felt like I needed to get involved. Since the health of the planet is reflected by the health of the animals around us, I'm hopeful that if we're able to take care of them, they'll actually be taking care of us. WWF's Panda Ambassador program is a great fit for me, allowing me to keep my day job and still have an impact.

What have you done as a Panda Ambassador that you are most proud of?

Lobby Day in March was a terrific experience. I felt energized by hearing from other Panda Ambassadors, getting a deeper understanding of important legislation, and connecting directly with our elected officials to let them know that voters care about environmental issues and expect Congress to act accordingly.

What do you think is the most important thing people can do to help save the planet?

Tweak our lifestyles to reduce our carbon footprints—recycle, eat less meat, buy fewer things that last longer—and generally be conscious of what we take from the world around us. If we all try to take a little less and give back where possible, we'll make tremendous strides toward a better, more sustainable world.

What gives you hope for the future?

I'm encouraged by the surging numbers of consumers and employees who seek out companies that give back socially and environmentally, and I'm hopeful that this demand can create a positive feedback loop that sets us on the right track for sustainability.",https://assets.worldwildlife.org/www-prd/images/Medium_WW269650.2e16d0ba.fill-1200x630-c100.jpg,N,,2025-10-14 12:11:59.634187

EV ADOPTION RATE TO SLOW

""Following recent U.S. Government policy changes, including the termination of certain consumer tax incentives for EV purchases and the reduction in the stringency of emissions regulations, we expect the adoption rate of EVs to slow,"" GM said in a filing on Tuesday.

Shares of the Detroit, Michigan-based automaker were down 2.5% in premarket trading. The stock has been up about 4.5% this year.

Some auto industry executives, including Ford CEO Jim Farley, have warned that EV sales will drop significantly in the absence of the tax credit. However, some, including the CEO of Hyundai Motor North America, have said that the EV market remains resilient.

Both GM and crosstown rival Ford had launched a program that would have allowed dealers to offer a $7,500 tax credit on EV leases after the federal subsidy expired, before walking back on those plans.

The changes will not affect GM's current portfolio of its Chevrolet, GMC and Cadillac EVs that are in production.

The Detroit automaker warned of the possibility of further charges as a result of the reassessment of its capacity and manufacturing footprint, which it said was still ongoing.

The charges comprise a $1.2 billion non-cash impairment related to EV capacity adjustments and $400 million for contract-cancellation fees and commercial settlements.

The charges will be recorded as adjustments to the automaker’s non-GAAP results for the third quarter scheduled for early next weeek.

Shares fell less than 2% before the opening bell Tuesday.

The EV tax credit ended last month. The clean vehicle tax credit was worth $7,500 for new EVs and up to $4,000 for used ones.

Meanwhile, the Environmental Protection Agency has been working on easing rules aimed at cleaning up auto tailpipe emissions as the Trump administration move to undo incentives for automakers to go electric. President Donald Trump has also challenged federal EV charging infrastructure money and blocked California’s ban of new gas-powered vehicle sales. It adds up to less pressure on automakers to continue evolving their production away from gas-burning vehicles.

General Motors, which had led the way among U.S. automakers with plans to convert production to an electric fleet of vehicles, said in a regulatory filing on Tuesday that it will have to book charges that include non-cash impairment and other charges of $1.2 billion due to EV capacity adjustments. There's also $400 million in charges mostly related to contract cancellation fees and commercial settlements associated with EV-related investments.

GM warned that it may take additional hits as it adjusts production, with non-cash charges potentially impacting operations and cash flow in the future.

The company said that its EV capacity realignment doesn't impact its retail portfolio of Chevrolet, GMC and Cadillac EVs currently in production, and that it expects those models to remain available to consumers.

EVs were considered to be the future of the US automotive industry. GM had announced in 2020 that it was going to invest $27 billion in electric and autonomous vehicles in the next five years, a 35% increase over plans made before the pandemic.

In 2021 GM said that it planned to have more than half of its North American and China factories be capable of making electric vehicles by 2030. It also pledged at the time to increase its investment in EV charging networks by nearly $750 million through 2025.

A year later, GM CEO Mary Barra said that the automaker would sell more electric vehicles in the U.S. than Tesla by the middle of the decade. GM also had a goal of making the vast majority of the vehicles it produces electric by 2035, and the entire company carbon neutral, including operations, five years after that.

Yet U.S. automakers are being hampered in some of their long-term planning, with drastic changes in economic and environmental policy from one administration to the next. The automakers are also facing increased competition from automakers such as China's BYD, which announced in July that its sales grew 31% in the first six months of the year to 2.1 million cars.

BYD’s sales have skyrocketed on the back of a government-driven EV boom in China. The rise of BYD and other Chinese electric vehicle makers is a challenge for Tesla and the world’s other major automakers as Chinese competitors push into Europe, Southeast Asia and other overseas markets with a relatively affordable option for drivers who want to go green.",https://images.wral.com/asset/news/technology/2025/10/14/22198635/68ee346762072-media_bbbc8d3c7554428bb951f2ca799113bf-DMID1-68nctnqip-640x480.jpg,N,,2025-10-14 09:03:17.113560

However, some experts say the Sandy Creek outage highlights what can go wrong with large power plants.","The Sandy Creek Energy Station is America’s newest coal-fired power plant, and it’s expected to remain offline until 2027. The power plant near Waco, Texas, which began delivering power to the grid in 2013, suffered a major failure in April after it was shuttered for maintenance.

The extended outage comes as Texas’ electric grid operator, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, has sounded the alarm over rising demand for electricity. While solar and battery development are booming across Texas, the state government is offering low-interest loans to incentivize the construction of new power plants. And the coal plant outage highlights a growing debate over which energy sources are best suited to power large loads.

What happened at Sandy Creek?

If it were operating, the 932-megawatt Sandy Creek plant would be able to power more than half a million homes. The coal plant shut down in late February for routine maintenance ahead of summer, according to the Electric Reliability Council of Texas. It remained offline through April 21.

Operators restarted the unit on April 22 and 23. Power output climbed slowly before nearly reaching full capacity by 9 p.m. on the second day. But shortly after 11 p.m., a major failure forced a complete shutdown, according to a report from the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA). The power plant hasn’t run since.

ERCOT initially reported that the facility would return to service on June 1, 2026. The grid operator now does not expect Sandy Creek to be back online until March 31, 2027 — a total outage exceeding two years, according to ERCOT’s September Monthly Outlook for Resource Adequacy.

The exact cause of the failure has not been publicly disclosed. The power plants’ owners, including Sandy Creek Energy Associates and the Lower Colorado River Authority, did not respond to questions from Straight Arrow News.

What’s the history of the power plant?

This is not the first incident to befall Sandy Creek. Over a decade ago, the power plant’s initial startup was delayed by more than a year.

Construction nearly finished in late 2011, with the plant expected to begin commercial operations in early 2012. But during testing in October 2011, the boiler sustained severe damage when tubes overheated, according to Standard & Poor’s. The credit rating agency downgraded its financial outlook on the project following the incident.

Repairs stretched beyond a year. The plant finally started commercial operations in May 2013, according to reporting by NPR.

What does it say about coal power and reliability?

The outage comes as the Trump administration has ordered some coal plants to stay open past their initially planned retirement dates. The administration’s energy policy has prioritized large power plants that are designed to operate through all hours of the day, instead of wind and solar power, that is dependent on specific weather conditions.

In a press release announcing federal funding for the coal industry, Energy Secretary Chris Wright said coal power is “vital to keeping electricity prices low and the lights on without interruption.”

In this view, power plants are more valuable for the grid because they are not intermittent sources. However, some experts say the Sandy Creek outage highlights what can go wrong with large power plants.

“The two-year outage at Sandy Creek highlights the reliability risks of fossil-fueled power,” Seth Feaster, an energy data analyst at IEEFA, wrote, “and reinforces the need for wind, solar and battery sources that are more distributed and more reliable.”

Sandy Creek’s problems echo those at Comanche 3, a 750-MW coal unit in Colorado that opened in 2010. After repeated outages, including a year-long closure in 2020, owner Xcel Energy agreed to close the plant in 2030 — some 40 years earlier than originally planned.",https://san.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2150754136_Getty_Images_clean.jpg,N,,2025-10-14 11:01:50.671352

US manufacturing is back in the policy spotlight. After decades of offshoring and industrial stagnation, lawmakers are advancing legislation to bring production home, support innovation, and create resilient supply chains. From the CHIPS and Science Act to expanded R&D tax credits, the message is clear: America wants to make things again.

But legislative momentum is only part of the story. The reality on the ground is more complex. Manufacturing investments take years to scale. Labor markets face deep skill shortages. Regulatory and trade frameworks remain inconsistent. These challenges point to a simple but often overlooked truth: time, not just policy, is the critical input in reviving US industry.

A new wave of pro-growth policy is taking shape

Recent years have seen a cascade of laws designed to reshore industrial capacity and spur innovation. The CHIPS and Science Act provides $280 billion in funding for semiconductor manufacturing, research, and workforce development. The Inflation Reduction Act supports clean manufacturing and energy infrastructure with long-term tax incentives. And perhaps most critically for many firms, changes to the treatment of R&D costs now allow immediate expensing rather than multi-year amortization.

For manufacturers, this represents a significant shift. Immediate tax relief for domestic R&D makes cash flow planning more predictable and encourages longer-term innovation bets. Permanent credits also offer a degree of certainty often absent in past tax policy cycles.

Federal investment is also paired with rising state-level competition. Many states now offer stackable tax credits, expedited permitting processes, or training grants to attract manufacturers. The landscape is increasingly shaped not just by federal mandates but by regional strategies to become next-generation industrial hubs.

Yet as these incentives expand, many firms remain cautious. Large-scale investments in physical infrastructure, workforce development, and supplier relationships require more than line-item funding. They require time, execution, and a clear regulatory runway.

Time is the missing variable in the manufacturing equation

Manufacturing is not a software startup. Capital projects take years from planning to production. Semiconductor fabrication facilities, for example, can take three to five years to build and commission. Battery plants, precision machining centers, and pharmaceutical facilities face similarly long lead times.

Time also matters in workforce development. Retraining workers or building pipelines through technical colleges and apprenticeships is a multi-year effort. The lag between funding announcements and actual skilled labor output is often underestimated in political discourse.

In addition, supply chains do not reorganize overnight. A manufacturer moving operations back to the US must find or develop domestic suppliers, requalify materials, and test for quality assurance, all before full production can resume. That complexity increases in regulated industries like aerospace or life sciences.

This extended timeline makes consistency in policymaking essential. Tax credits that expire in three years do not align with a facility that takes five years to build. Infrastructure bills with one-time funding windows often fall short of long-term operational needs. To succeed, pro-growth policies must match the real tempo of manufacturing.

Regulatory complexity and global trade volatility create friction

Despite favorable legislation, many firms still hesitate to commit. One major reason is regulatory friction. Permitting timelines are long and vary across states. Environmental assessments, zoning approvals, and community negotiations can stretch for months or even years, delaying projects that are otherwise ready to proceed.

Trade policy also introduces uncertainty. Fluctuating tariffs on raw materials like steel, aluminum, and rare earths make cost modeling unpredictable. Waivers may be granted, but the process and timing are unclear. For many manufacturers, especially in high-margin or low-volume segments, this volatility complicates capital planning.

The regulatory cost of compliance, particularly for energy-intensive or emissions-sensitive industries, presents another challenge. While environmental standards are essential, navigating overlapping federal, state, and local regulations creates added costs and delays.

Workforce strategy must match industrial ambition

No matter how generous the incentives, they mean little without a skilled workforce. US manufacturing faces a demographic cliff. Many experienced machinists, operators, and supervisors are approaching retirement, with too few younger workers entering to replace them.

The pipeline is broken at multiple points. K–12 education has largely moved away from industrial skills. Vocational training is often outdated or underfunded. Community colleges play a critical role but frequently lack the equipment, instructors, or partnerships needed to keep pace with modern manufacturing.

Some companies are acting. Siemens, Toyota, and other manufacturers have launched their own apprenticeship programs. Others partner with state governments to co-fund training centers. But these initiatives take time to scale and deliver results.

Immigration policy is also a factor. Skilled immigrants have historically played a major role in the tech and manufacturing sectors, but current visa systems are not designed for industrial roles. Without reform, this remains an underused resource.

Industrial revitalization must include a labor plan. That means investing in education, modernizing training programs, aligning certifications with employer needs, and expanding access to skilled immigration pathways. Without this, even well-funded factories may remain idle.

Reviving US manufacturing is not a short-term effort. The current mix of tax incentives, infrastructure spending, and regulatory reform is a strong foundation. But its success depends on sustained commitment and realistic timelines.

Manufacturing plays a strategic role in the US economy. It supports high-wage jobs, anchors critical supply chains, and strengthens national security. The policy framework is improving. Capital is cautiously returning. What matters now is staying the course, maintaining support, reducing red tape, and investing in the human infrastructure that makes factories run. Growth, in this context, refers to a steady build.",https://manufacturing-today.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/10/ManufacturingUS9-2048x1136.png,N,,2025-10-14 18:03:03.510774

His adrenaline racing, he remembered making sure his harness was clipped not once, but twice.

He’d never climbed up onto a roof before, let alone with a 50-pound panel of metal and wires strapped to his body. Each step tested his nerves. He could feel the shingles shift beneath his boots, and the June heat pressing through the soles. Below, life in Houston’s Fifth Ward unfolded: a swirl of distant freeway noise, laughter from his co-workers, and the ever-present backdrop of refinery stacks on the horizon.

Less than a year earlier, locked behind prison walls, he never could have imagined being handed the chance to invest in his city — or, even more improbably, to be investing in himself. Yet here he was, working shoulder-to-shoulder with a team to transform sunlight into electricity, forging a new sense of purpose in every bolt and connection.

This past summer, Dillard was one of roughly 50 participants in an inaugural solar installation training program geared toward Black, low-income residents of Houston, many of them formerly incarcerated, and from parts of the city long associated with poverty and pollution.

The 22-week training hosted by the Black United Fund of Texas, the city of Houston, and the Green Thumb Academy offered students not just a steady paycheck of $18 an hour and certification in solar installation via the National Center for Construction Education and Research, but the possibility to heal, build, and protect their communities.

“It gave me a sense of purpose,” said Dillard, a 37-year-old who was incarcerated for two years before his release in September 2024.

As he puts it, his hometown is the “energy capital of the world.” But for so long, that designation has actually come at the expense of the Black people who call Houston and Southeast Texas home, researchers have concluded. For generations, Fifth Ward residents unknowingly lived on a plume of coal tar, toxic waste from a neighboring rail yard that was abandoned and leached into the soil. Eventually, cancer clusters began to develop in the neighborhood. Today, residents are expected to die two decades before residents born in more affluent and white Houston neighborhoods.

But Dillard said this program was allowing him to do work that breaks cycles of harm while literally generating cleaner futures for the neighborhoods that have long been burdened by oil and gas pollution.

“Being a part of [the program] felt like creating history,” he said. “Learning the trade with people from similar backgrounds [not only] gave us something to offer back to society, but also ourselves.”

Yet the very training that provided Dillard a lifeline almost disappeared as quickly as it began.

The program was funded in part by a $20 million grant from the federal Environmental Protection Agency to the Black United Fund of Texas and the Houston Health Department. It was a part of President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act, a $2 billion pool of money meant to stimulate the economy by investing in infrastructure upgrades to protect communities from climate threats like hurricanes and wildfires. The Biden administration also wanted those funds to be used to address environmental justice issues, which residents of Fifth Ward said they have faced in the form of pollution for decades.

However, the funds were targeted for reversal in Project 2025, the conservative manifesto that the administration of President Donald Trump uses as a framework for many of its policies. In May, Trump directed the EPA to cancel the grants, leaving the Houston training program in limbo. Later in the summer, the administration sought to cancel $7 billion in funding for solar programs and installation in Black and low-income areas. About a quarter of the students dropped out of the Houston program after the funding issues were made public.

Still, that didn’t stop the Black United Fund.

“We’ve worked before without literal dollars,” Velika Thomas said in February as Trump began his environmental cuts. “It would be awesome to have the money, but we’re going to get through it somehow” without federal support. And even with an annual budget of around $250,000, the organization did just that. The program combined funds and grants to pay the wages of the trainees.

For Thomas, the dilemma confirmed how important it is to support her own community. “As a Black person, I have not felt that America has ever put us at the forefront,” she said. “We are not a waste; the community is not a waste.”

As the Trump administration continues slashing federal support for climate programs and dismissing the impact of environmental racism, leaders of the program known as Vulnerable to Vibrant say cities need to continue to put forth such solutions even without federal support.

Advocates said community support in the form of donations can also sustain critical climate programs even if the federal government reduces or stops direct funding. Last year, environmental organizations saw an 8% increase in giving, reaching an all-time high of nearly $22 billion being donated for such work. Between 2021 and 2023, the donations and grants received by the Black United Fund nearly quadrupled.

“We can chart a way out while doing good for our people,” Shanitra Sanford, a graduate of the solar program, told Capital B. “We should all strive for that.”

Despite the disruption in federal funding, state and philanthropic investments continue to produce measurable local outcomes. Programs have popped up in each of the 10 geographic regions of the U.S. organized by the EPA. Watts Rising in Los Angeles has completed dozens of rooftop solar installations and multiple job placements in energy workforce pipelines for low-income residents. Chicago’s Renewing Sovereignty Project has certified dozens of formerly incarcerated people for clean energy employment.

For Sanford, who was incarcerated a total of four years, the focus on training people in solar installation is also about investing in a more stable and hopeful future for her three children, whose ages range from 2 to 15.

“I want to give them a sense of confidence in themselves and their home,” she said.

Health researchers estimate that transitioning the U.S. fully from fossil fuels to clean energy sources like solar could prevent more than 50,000 premature deaths every year by eliminating air pollution from energy-related activities.

Texas now ranks second only to California in total solar energy usage, and employs the third most people in the U.S. solar industry. The state added thousands of new solar jobs last year alone, while oil and gas employment shrank by about 8% since July 2024.

Another community solar group, Green Careers Texas, has connected dozens of trainees from local initiatives across the state and helped complete hundreds of installations through municipal and nonprofit partnerships.

This momentum in clean energy, program managers hope, shows how local action can drive broad impact.

As is the Black United Fund’s motto: “When we help ourselves, we help the total community at large become productive, and being partners in the community ensures the future of all people.”

Texas program connects formerly incarcerated workers to green energy

Sanford’s introduction to the program was as much about learning the physical realities of solar installation as it was absorbing the layered reasons the training existed in the first place. On most days, participants split time between classroom instruction — covering electrical basics, Occupational Safety and Health Administration safety rights, and the mechanics of solar arrays — and afternoons hoisting panels, climbing rungs, and practicing real rooftop installations on homes and in neighborhood mock-ups.

In a converted classroom in the Fifth Ward, the cohort of men and women — most recently released from Texas prisons — learned together about the ways that this labor could improve the health of their neighborhoods.

Timesha Beattie of Green Thumb Academy, leading a team of trainers and organizers, opened sessions with reminders of what certification could mean for families and neighborhoods: “Once you earn these credentials, nobody can ever take them away. You are going to be able to take back to your families the knowledge, the information, the credentials.” Sanford and Dillard could almost recite back word for word what Beattie said weeks after the class had ended.

The practical details mattered. The city and its partners provided not only a paycheck but the kind of support usually reserved for full-time jobs like direct deposit and worksite insurance. “It was book knowledge, but also it was hands-on — getting that panel on the roof, working as a team, finding out who you could rely on,” Sanford said.

The pay “was pretty good,” Dillard said, but more importantly, it gave him somewhere to be in community in the early months of his release.

Students handled gear, tested wiring alongside mentors, and learned how the electricity generated from sunlight powered nearby homes. By the end of the five-month program, participants could identify wiring color codes, install ceiling fans, and debate the future of Texas clean energy. The path from enrollment to graduation winnowed the group from 50 to a dozen, which training organizers said was a testament to the program’s rigor. But those who remained left with certifications, a pathway to union apprenticeships, and a sense of possibility.

“Learning this trade, whether plumbing, electrical, or construction … it’s something you can do as a career and retire from,” Dillard said.

Rather than training people to leave their community for jobs elsewhere, the program’s structure funneled graduates toward local employment. Training organizers and graduates said they see the initiative as a template resilient enough to function even at a moment when the validity of climate change is under question: rooted in local networks, able to partner with colleges and city agencies, and nimble enough to weather uncertain federal funding. “We have the tools and the networks in our communities to do this,” Sanford said.

Without stable, large-scale federal funding, programs like the one in Houston can make only a small dent in the overall shift to clean energy. Local training and job placements are important, but big challenges — like complex utility regulations and the high upfront cost of solar panels — get in the way. Experts say that to bring clean energy to many more communities, the government needs to restore and expand public investment and create better policies that help these local efforts grow beyond just small pilot projects.

However, replicating Houston’s model is a start. These programs may not guarantee clean energy for every city block, but participants said they offer one blueprint for economic reintegration in neighborhoods overlooked by America’s billion-dollar energy boom.

For the first few months after he was released from prison, Dillard said he would tell anybody he could that being incarcerated was “probably the best thing that ever happened” to him. It was the first time he was able to participate in an educational program that he believed could benefit his life and where he was supported as an individual.

But as the one-year anniversary of his release approached, he said his earlier belief had changed.

“I really just needed to be a part of [the program], be a part of something,” he said as he thumbed at copies of his new certificates and diploma from the training, which he proudly laminated on his own.

In fact, mainstream climate experts have found that rising CO2 levels, by causing climate change, are harmful to agriculture overall – and likely to cause food prices to increase.

The Trump administration’s claim arose from a draft “critical review” report commissioned by DOE and written by fringe experts. The DOE subsequently disbanded that group when faced with a lawsuit alleging that it violated a law requiring that such federal advisory committees must be transparent and unbiased.

The Environmental Protection Agency cited the DOE report in a proposal to reverse its Obama-era determination that carbon pollution poses a threat to public health and welfare. The agency argued that higher carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere will increase the amount of food that farmers produce, implying that carbon pollution is a good thing.

“Recent data and analysis show that even marginal increases in CO2 concentrations have substantial beneficial impacts on plant growth and agricultural productivity, and that this benefit has been significantly greater than previously believed,” the agency wrote.

Mainstream climate experts say that’s incorrect.

In response to the DOE report, a group of 85 climate experts and the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine each published comprehensive reviews of the scientific literature and arrived at the opposite conclusion. These expert reports found that rather than boosting agricultural productivity, the body of scientific evidence indicates that increased extreme weather resulting from climate change will instead reduce crop yields, making food more expensive.

Weather disasters are very, very bad for crops

The notion that crops will benefit from climate pollution is based on the fact that plants absorb carbon dioxide during photosynthesis. Scientists have known for decades that in a controlled environment like a glass greenhouse, higher CO2 levels in the air will cause plants to grow bigger.

But Earth’s atmosphere isn’t a controlled environment. Increased carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere trap extra heat like a blanket, causing more frequent extreme weather like heat waves, droughts, and floods. These events stress plants and hamper their growth and productivity.

Innovations in agricultural practices like the use of fertilizers, pesticides, new seed varieties, and irrigation have boosted crop yields over the past century. But increasingly extreme weather could slow those gains.

To study these complex variables, scientists have conducted what are known as free-air CO2 enrichment, or FACE, experiments. These studies use pipes or vents to release carbon dioxide into large open plots of crops.

A 2020 analysis of 30 years of FACE experiments found that higher carbon dioxide concentrations increased crop yields as expected when “under non-stress conditions.” But when stressed by factors like changing temperatures or precipitation, as climate experts said recently, “the yield increases were suppressed and in some cases erased.”

Climate damages overwhelm farmers’ efforts to adapt

Farmers may be able to adapt to some climate impacts, for example, by adjusting plant varieties, fertilizers, and crop cultivation windows. But those changes won’t be sufficient to fully overcome damage from climate change, according to a study published in June 2025.

The study’s authors estimated that each additional 1°C of global warming in 2100 will reduce crop yields by the equivalent of 4.4% of each person on Earth’s recommended daily calorie intake. Most staple crops, including wheat, corn, and soybeans, will see significant yield declines.

Read: More CO2 in the atmosphere hurts key plants and crops more than it helps

And farmers are already experiencing the impacts of climate change. Another 2025 study found that thanks to more efficient farming practices, the amount of global land devoted to agriculture could have decreased 2% over the past 30 years – while growing the same amount of food. Instead, global croplands expanded by nearly 4% during that time because climate change slowed the growth in agricultural productivity.

The paper estimated that those climate impacts caused over 200 million acres of land to be converted to cropland – twice the area of California. And converting existing ecosystems like forests to agricultural land reduced the amount of carbon absorbed by plant life on Earth. The study estimated that this land conversion added 22 billion tons of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. That’s the equivalent of about six months of humanity’s carbon dioxide emissions.

It’s a vicious cycle – climate change reduces agricultural yields, which forces farmers to convert more forests to cropland, which adds more carbon to the atmosphere and worsens climate change.

Climate change could make food more expensive

As the law of supply and demand tells us, if crop yields are suppressed while people still need to eat the same amount of food, prices will rise. A 2024 study estimated that “annual food inflation of 1-3 percentage points per year could result from temperatures projected for 2035.”

Another problem is that climate change is worsening many different types of extreme weather, which can sometimes strike the same place at the same time. Scientists call these events compound extremes.

A 2022 study looked at the impacts of these compound extremes on crop yields. The authors concluded, “Since around 2000, these compound extremes, and hot droughts in particular, have been linked to especially poor harvests (up to 30% yield losses) in regions such as India, Ethiopia, the USA, Europe and Russia.” For example, a combined heat wave and drought in the Midwest U.S. in 2012 was estimated to reduce corn yields by 20% that season.

And a 2021 paper found that over the prior three decades, temperature-related crop losses resulted in $27 billion in crop insurance claims due to reduced yields in part as a result of these kinds of severely suppressed crop yield seasons.

The verdict: carbon damages overwhelm benefits for crops

As this body of scientific research illustrates, although plants directly benefit from higher carbon dioxide levels, the damages from extreme weather are already becoming bigger than those benefits.

Farmers have so far been able to overcome those climate damages by devoting more land to agriculture and implementing innovative practices. But there are limits to land and water availability, and detrimental effects on the environment and health from applying too many pesticides and fertilizers.

Meanwhile, climate damages will only worsen as long as temperatures continue to rise. As the report written by 85 climate scientists concluded, “in the major agricultural growing regions of the U.S. (and in most parts of the world), CO2-induced climate change will lead to yield declines.” That will lead to higher food prices until humanity stops the rise in global temperatures by reaching net-zero carbon pollution.",https://i0.wp.com/yaleclimateconnections.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/202510-is-global-warming-good-for-plants.jpg?fit=1600%2C900&ssl=1,N,,2025-10-14 08:02:22.778813

Shares fell less than 2% before the opening bell Tuesday.

The EV tax credit ended last month. The clean vehicle tax credit was worth $7,500 for new EVs and up to $4,000 for used ones.

Meanwhile, the Environmental Protection Agency has been working on easing rules aimed at cleaning up auto tailpipe emissions as the Trump administration move to undo incentives for automakers to go electric. President Donald Trump has also challenged federal EV charging infrastructure money and blocked California’s ban of new gas-powered vehicle sales. It adds up to less pressure on automakers to continue evolving their production away from gas-burning vehicles.

General Motors, which had led the way among U.S. automakers with plans to convert production to an electric fleet of vehicles, said in a regulatory filing on Tuesday that it will have to book charges that include non-cash impairment and other charges of $1.2 billion due to EV capacity adjustments. There's also $400 million in charges mostly related to contract cancellation fees and commercial settlements associated with EV-related investments.

GM warned that it may take additional hits as it adjusts production, with non-cash charges potentially impacting operations and cash flow in the future.

The company said that its EV capacity realignment doesn't impact its retail portfolio of Chevrolet, GMC and Cadillac EVs currently in production, and that it expects those models to remain available to consumers.

EVs were considered to be the future of the US automotive industry. GM had announced in 2020 that it was going to invest $27 billion in electric and autonomous vehicles in the next five years, a 35% increase over plans made before the pandemic.

In 2021 GM said that it planned to have more than half of its North American and China factories be capable of making electric vehicles by 2030. It also pledged at the time to increase its investment in EV charging networks by nearly $750 million through 2025.

A year later, GM CEO Mary Barra said that the automaker would sell more electric vehicles in the U.S. than Tesla by the middle of the decade. GM also had a goal of making the vast majority of the vehicles it produces electric by 2035, and the entire company carbon neutral, including operations, five years after that.

Yet U.S. automakers are being hampered in some of their long-term planning, with drastic changes in economic and environmental policy from one administration to the next. The automakers are also facing increased competition from automakers such as China's BYD, which announced in July that its sales grew 31% in the first six months of the year to 2.1 million cars.

BYD’s sales have skyrocketed on the back of a government-driven EV boom in China. The rise of BYD and other Chinese electric vehicle makers is a challenge for Tesla and the world’s other major automakers as Chinese competitors push into Europe, Southeast Asia and other overseas markets with a relatively affordable option for drivers who want to go green.",https://www.tricityrecordnm.com/wp-content/themes/durango/images/default_article_image_dur.jpeg,N,,2025-10-14 12:16:38.932865

Wind turbines are some of the biggest ones, but there are other large military payloads as well.”","The infrastructure underpinning ground transport is designed for daily commerce – not the specialised demands of oversized industrial cargo.

As global requirements evolve, supply chains face mounting pressure, particularly in sectors like renewable energy, where the scale of components for wind turbines presents a major logistical test.

Radia, an aerospace company founded in 2016 by engineer Mark Lundstrom, is developing a solution to this challenge.

Its WindRunner aircraft is designed to transport the world’s largest wind turbine blades and other oversized cargo to remote locations that are inaccessible by road or rail.

With the next generation of turbine blades set to exceed 100 metres, traditional road infrastructure, which is limited to blades of around 70 metres, requires a fundamental reconsideration of logistics.

Redefining onshore wind logistics

The WindRunner is being positioned not just as a cargo aircraft but as a logistics enabler for the renewable energy sector. Its primary function is to unlock supply chains that are currently constrained by the weight and length of wind turbine blades that conventional ground transportation cannot support.

The aircraft's design allows it to carry turbine blades over 105 metres long and land on semi-prepared, unpaved runways as short as 1,800 metres.

According to Radia, the aircraft will offer 7,700 cubic metres of cargo space, which is approximately ten times the volume of a Boeing 777, and can carry a payload of between 72.6 and 80 tonnes.

This capability could mean it can deliver components directly to project sites far from ports or major roadways, potentially cutting the need for complex and expensive last-mile logistics.

Following its public reveal at the 2025 Paris Air Show, Radia is targeting a first flight in 2029, with commercial service expected in the early 2030s.

This development is particularly relevant for onshore wind energy. Radia's broader initiative, termed GigaWind, aims to facilitate the onshore deployment of the largest turbines ever used.

The goal is to apply the economies of scale seen in offshore wind projects to inland locations, leading to longer blades, taller turbines and greater energy output.

Addressing a supply chain bottleneck

The WindRunner project does more than just transport wind turbine parts; it addresses a primary threat to clean energy growth, which is logistics.

In 2023, Tim Dawidowsky, Chief Operating Officer at Siemens Gamesa, explained: “The supply chain is facing substantial challenges that could limit production capacity and increase turbine prices.”

By enabling the direct delivery of larger blades to remote sites, WindRunner could remove a long-standing obstacle for the industry.

It is designed to bypass congested roads and bridges, avoid the constraints of rail networks and eliminate the need for costly infrastructure upgrades to reach build sites. This change could also improve the cost curve for wind energy.

Taller turbines with longer blades are capable of producing more energy more consistently, delivering what Radia calls a ""step function improvement"" in both output and reliability compared to current-generation turbines.

The aircraft's potential applications extend beyond the energy sector. Its large cargo bay and rugged landing capabilities make it suitable for other oversized loads, such as military payloads, disaster relief materials and large aerospace components.

Mark Lundstrom, Founder and CEO of Radia, says, “We are essentially looking at building a platform for moving the biggest things in the world in the hardest-to-reach places. Wind turbines are some of the biggest ones, but there are other large military payloads as well.”",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/43b678a286dbc7e98762f90cfc79a2fc:a01ae83e0440c29720886aeebaa17372/unloading-1.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-10-14 11:01:22.283757

The expiration of the $7,500 federal tax credit for electric vehicles, initially passed by Democrats during the Biden administration, leaves consumers looking for other ways to save on their next purchase.

Experts say the tax credit previously helped make electric vehicles more affordable, increasing interest in them.

Aaron Bragman, the Detroit Bureau Chief at Cars.com, said automakers are now offering electric vehicles that are both profitable for them and affordable for consumers.

Bragman noted, ""The tax credit has been good for just about everybody. It's really kind of fostered this whole nascent industry of electric vehicles. It's gotten people a lot more familiar with them and how they work. It's helped to build out the infrastructure, the charging infrastructure in the United States, because there's demand for it. People want the fast charging infrastructure throughout the country, even that has really been starting to accelerate.""

There may still be separate incentives available at state and local levels.

""The affordable EV isn't necessarily going away, and there are still some incentives out there,"" Bragman said. ""It just takes some research and some partnering with your local dealership to find out what those might be where you are.""

,EVs,2025-10-14 11:17:35+00:00,Heatmap News,Alsym Thinks It Can Break the U.S. Battery Manufacturing Curse - Heatmap News,Katie Brigham,,,,,https://heatmap.news/climate-tech/alsym-sodium-ion-launch,"Aghion argues that climate policy needs to hit hard and hit quickly, precisely to induce the kind of competitive innovation that he thinks drives economic growth.
But the power of dirty business remained immense — and opposed to climate policy.
The cost of operating a coal plant in the U.S. has increased by nearly 30% since 2021 — faster than inflation — according to research by Energy Innovation.
The Trump administration has also based its support for coal plants on the idea that they are needed for reliability.
In a report last year, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation warned that outage rates for coal plants are increasing.","“I think innovation is the best hope for climate change,” Aghion said in a 2023 interview with VoxTalks Economics. “Of course, we need to innovate in our day to day behavior, but we’ll fight climate change because we will find new sources of energy that are cleaner than coal or gas, and because we will also find ways to produce with energy-saving devices.”

Along with Brown University economist Peter Howitt, Aghion developed mathematical models to describe how creative destruction works, building on foundational work by the Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter. Along the way, Aghion also worked with 2024 Nobel laureate Daron Acemoglu, who won his prize for describing the institutions that best foster economic growth.

Aghion and Acemoglu have tangled with fellow laureate William Nordhaus, whose models of how the harms of climate change slow down economic growth practically invented the field of climate economics. In Nordhaus’ framing, climate change is the ultimate externality — that is, an economic factor not reflected in the market. The most efficient way to solve climate change, then, is to price in the externality by putting a tax on carbon emissions. Once the price of highly emitting goods reflects the true cost of producing them, the market will naturally favor lower-emitting goods.

Aghion instead sees carbon prices as another way to spur climate-friendly innovation throughout the economy.

In a 2014 paper written with Cameron Hepburn, Alexander Teytelboym, and Dimitri Zenghelis, Aghion argued that “product and process innovation” will ultimately drive decarbonization. Previous approaches to climate economics, Aghion wrote, use inadequate models for the effects of innovation, and so “significantly bias the assessment of the cost of future low-carbon technologies” to be higher than they are in reality.

To be clear, Aghion isn’t against a carbon tax. “A carbon tax or carbon price is a tool to redirect natural charge but it’s not the only tool,” Aghion said during the 2023 interview. “You need other tools, as well,” including “subsidies to green innovation, and more generally green industrial policy.” The point is less to discourage emitters and more to encourage the producers of non-emitting technologies.

Aghion argues that climate policy needs to hit hard and hit quickly, precisely to induce the kind of competitive innovation that he thinks drives economic growth. “If you wait longer, firms will be even better at dirty technologies, and it will take longer before their skills on clean technologies catch up with their skills on dirty technologies, and so you need to act promptly,” he said in 2023.

In a 2012 paper on the auto industry written with Antoine Dechezleprêtre, David Hemous Ralf Martin, and John Van Reenen, Aghion tracks patents in the auto industry and finds that “higher fuel prices induce firms to redirect technical change towards clean innovation and away from dirty innovation.”

He also finds that the nature of the firms matters. Companies that have a background in green technology innovate more in green technology, while companies that specialize in carbon-emitting or “dirty” technologies are more likely to find better ways to emit carbon. You’d expect Porsche or Ferrari to come up with a better internal combustion engine than Tesla, for instance, but for Tesla to invest more in pushing the capabilities of electric drivetrains.

Tesla is in many ways the ideal example of this kind of policy mix working. The company has benefited both from federal and state taxes on gasoline (as well as California’s unique emissions rules), which suppress demand for fossil fuels, and from subsidies and other financial support, which helped it reach economies of scale and performance parity with internal combustion vehicles more quickly.

While theoretically every auto company had the same incentives in both California and the nation as a whole to develop electric vehicles, Tesla made up the bulk of the entire market for years as it never had to split its focus between a legacy internal combustion business and a battery electric business.

Aghion’s work supports this kind of “belt-and-suspenders” approach to climate policy, where fossil fuel emissions are made more expensive and subsidies are provided to advance green innovation.

This may sound pretty familiar. While America’s signature climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act, eschewed carbon taxes in favor of incentives and subsidies, the overall policy mix pursued by the Biden administration — including a fee on methane emissions, regulations on tailpipe and power plant emissions, and increased fuel economy standards — approximated this mix.

Aghion clearly recognized the IRA as a real life version of his ideas. When asked in 2023 about the kind of industrial policy he envisioned, he said, “The Americans are doing it now with the IRA.”

This kind of policy mix wasn’t just optimal policy economically, but also necessary politically.

Pointing to France’s experience with fuel taxes, which led to country-wide protests beginning in 2018, he cautioned that if policy makes dirty fuels more expensive without making clean technology technology cheaper, “then people riot.”

Of course, the IRA and other U.S. climate policies have not been as politically durable as their supporters hoped for. This is despite the fact that, alongside trying to boost green businesses, recent attempts at industrial policy explicitly tried to support “dirty” business, as well, whether by subsidizing older auto companies’ investments in electric vehicles or by supporting carbon capture and hydrogen investments by big oil companies.

But the power of dirty business remained immense — and opposed to climate policy.

The oil and gas industry were some of the biggest supporters of President Trump’s reelection campaign. Since he took office, one of their own — former fracking executive Chris Wright — has overseen the dismantling of much of the Energy Department’s investments in clean energy.

The basic calculus of Aghion’s approach may very well persist as rich countries struggle with growth and the harms attributed to climate change continue to add up.

“I think now we made progress on the idea that innovation is a big part of the solution and … that carbon price is not enough,” he said. “You need smart industrial policy aimed at green innovation. That’s the idea.”

Republicans are growing frustrated with President Donald Trump’s rollbacks of policies to support solar energy, the cheapest and fastest-growing source of electricity at a moment when power prices are soaring nationwide. In Georgia, voters who backed the president say the repeal of programs that offered free panels to low-income Americans is making them second-guess their ballots. One of those voters, 39-year-old Jennifer McCoy told The New York Times, “I like a lot of Trump’s outlooks on things, but there are some things, like the solar panels, that I don’t like, now that I know.”

Utah Governor Spencer Cox, meanwhile, went on a tear on X over the Bureau of Land Management’s quashing of the nation’s largest solar project, the 6.2-gigawatt Esmeralda 7 in Nevada. In a post that linked to the scoop Heatmap’s Jael Holzman published last week on the cancellation, Cox said, “This is how we lose the AI/energy arms race with China.” While he noted that “intermittent sources have been overvalued in the past (and offshore wind is a disaster and should be discontinued), the incredible leaps in battery technology completely change the value proposition of solar in the right places.” He went on to re-post messages from three think tank researchers criticizing the move and warnings about the energy needs of data centers.

2. Corpus Christi, a Texas energy boom town, is running out of water

Corpus Christi is the main water provider for South Texas, a region that has drawn the likes of Tesla, Exxon Mobil, fuel refineries, plastic producers, and lithium processors with what The Wall Street Journal called “the promise of land, cheap energy and, perhaps most critically, abundant water.” But a crippling drought is depleting the region’s reservoirs, and the city may fail to meet the area’s water demand in as little as 18 months. “Cue the panic,” the newspaper wrote. Industrial plants are bracing for rate hikes. “The water situation in South Texas is about as dire as I’ve ever seen it,” said Mike Howard, chief executive of Howard Energy Partners, a private energy company that owns several facilities in Corpus Christi. “It has all the energy in the world, and it doesn’t have water.”

3. Chinese turbine giant invests $2 billion in a Scottish factory

China last week ratcheted up restrictions on exports of rare earths, including for electric vehicle batteries and semiconductors, kicking off another round of the trade war with the United States. But in Scotland, one of China’s biggest wind turbine manufacturers is investing more than $2 billion in building a new factory. Guangdong-based Ming Yang announced plans for its new plant to churn out parts for offshore turbines on Friday, though the company said the move was “subject to final approvals from the U.K. government,” the Financial Times reported.

In the U.S., meanwhile, the Trump administration’s crackdown on offshore wind is so severe the oil industry is stepping in to complain, warning that it’s setting a dangerous precedent for other energy sectors, as I reported in this newsletter last week. But private actors are, at least, responding to the Trump administration’s push to re-shore critical industries to the U.S. On Monday morning, JPMorgan Chase announced plans to invest $10 billion into mineral production and infrastructure for artificial intelligence.

4. New York’s offshore wind project can’t secure a ship

Equinor’s 810-megawatt Empire Wind project off the coast of New York’s Long Island has faced real challenges, with the Trump administration halting construction in April before allowing it to resume in May. The latest hurdle? The developers can’t get hold of the specially-made vessel for installing wind turbines it was counting on having by next year. As Canary Media’s Clare Fieseler wrote on Friday, two shipbuilding companies broke into a public skirmish, with one unexpectedly canceling a contract and the other threatening legal action over the construction of the specialized ship. The vessel, which is more than 98% complete, is anchored in Singapore, its fate now uncertain. “We have been informed by Maersk of an issue concerning its contract with Seatrium related to the wind turbine installation vessel originally contracted by Empire Offshore Wind LLC for use in 2026,” an Equinor spokesperson told Fieseler. “We are currently assessing the implications of this issue and evaluating available options.”

The episode shows how the Trump administration’s “total war on wind power,” as Jael once put it, makes companies more vulnerable to other setbacks. The White House tasked a half-dozen federal agencies, as I previously wrote, with trying to block construction of offshore turbines. But the general lack of ships capable of carrying giant turbines was a problem even before Trump returned to office.

5. California lawmakers pass first-in-the-nation temperature standards

California lawmakers last week passed Senate Bill 655, a first-in-the-nation framework to set maximum standards for safe indoor temperatures in residential housing. The bill requires state agencies to achieve the standard as heat deaths surge across the country. While the state has long required homes to maintain a minimum indoor air temperature of 68 degrees Fahrenheit, there was no equivalent standard for heat. “SB 655 responds to the public health emergency of California’s deadly heat waves,” Senator Henry Stern, the bill’s lead author, said in a statement. “This bill proactively requires the state to include safe residential indoor temperatures in its policies and programs so that Californians, especially renters and low-income households who are most at risk, have life-saving cooling.”

It’s part of a bigger wave of state legislation on climate and energy that California just passed, as Heatmap’s Emily Pontecorvo outlined recently. Among them: Families who lose everything in future wildfires will now be able to collect the bulk of their insurance payout without having to catalog every item burned in the blaze under new legislation Governor Gavin Newsom signed Friday. Starting in 2026, as The New York Times reported, insurers must pay at least 60% of a homeowner’s personal-property coverage — up to $350,000 — without requiring a detailed inventory of everything lost. That’s double the 30% of the dwelling’s value that insurers were required to pay out in advance, with a payout capped at $250,000.

THE KICKER

As the Trump administration is gutting funding for America's polar research, the British are stepping in. The British Antarctic Survey’s RRS Sir David Attenborough, a state-of-the-art ship named after the famed naturalist, will bolster research on everything from “hunting underwater tsunamis” to tracking glacier melt and whale populations. “The saying goes 'what happens in Antarctica doesn't stay in Antarctica,’” BAS oceanographer Peter Davis told reporters during a tour of the vessel as it prepared to depart Harwich, eastern England, last week.

It’s puzzling, then, that the Trump administration is pouring vast government resources into saving aging coal plants and expediting advanced nuclear projects — two sources of energy that are famously financial black holes.

The Energy Department announced it would invest $625 million to “reinvigorate and expand America’s coal industry” in late September. Earlier this year, the agency also made $900 million available to “unlock commercial deployment of American-made small modular reactors.”

It’s hard to imagine what economic yardsticks would warrant funding to keep coal plants open. The cost of operating a coal plant in the U.S. has increased by nearly 30% since 2021 — faster than inflation — according to research by Energy Innovation. Driving that increase is the cost of coal itself, as well as the fact that the nation’s coal plants are simply getting very old and more expensive to maintain. “You can put all the money you want into a clunker, but at the end of the day, it’s really old, and it’s just going to keep getting more expensive over time, even if you have a short term fix,” Michelle Solomon, a program manager at Energy Innovation who authored the research, told me.

Keeping these plants online — even if they only operate some of the time— inevitably raises electricity bills. That’s because in many of the country’s electricity markets, the cost of power on any given day is determined by the most expensive plant running. On a hot summer day when everyone’s air conditioners are working hard and the grid operator has to tell a coal plant to switch on to meet demand, every electron delivered in the region will suddenly cost the same as coal, even if it was generated essentially for free by the sun or wind.

The Trump administration has also based its support for coal plants on the idea that they are needed for reliability. In theory, coal generation should be available around the clock. But in reality, the plants aren’t necessarily up to the task — and not just because they’re old. Sandy Creek in Texas, which began operating in 2013 and is the newest coal plant in the country, experienced a major failure this past April and is now expected to stay offline until 2027, according to the region’s grid operator. In a report last year, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation warned that outage rates for coal plants are increasing. This is in part due to wear and tear from the way these plants cycle on and off to accommodate renewable energy sources, the report said, but it’s also due to reduced maintenance as plant operators plan to retire the facilities.

“You can do the deferred maintenance. It might keep the plant operating for a bit longer, but at the end of the day, it’s still not going to be the most efficient source of energy, or the cheapest source of energy,” Solomon said.

The contradictions snowball from there. On September 30, the DOE opened a $525 million funding opportunity for coal plants titled “Restoring Reliability: Coal Recommissioning and Modernization,” inviting coal-fired power plants that are scheduled for retirement before 2032 or in rural areas to apply for grants that will help keep them open. The grant paperwork states that grid capacity challenges “are especially acute in regions with constrained transmission and sustained load growth.” Two days later, however, as part of the agency’s mass termination of grants, it canceled more than $1.3 billion in awards from the Grid Deployment Office to upgrade and install new transmission lines to ease those constraints.

The new funding opportunity may ultimately just shuffle awards around from one coal plant to another, or put previously-awarded projects through the time-and-money-intensive process of reapplying for the same funding under a new name. Up to $350 million of the total will go to as many as five coal plants, with initial funding to restart closed plants or to modernize old ones, and later phases designated for carbon capture, utilization, and storage retrofits. The agency said it will use “unobligated” money from three programs that were part of the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act: the Carbon Capture Demonstration Projects Program, the Carbon Capture Large-Scale Pilot Projects, and the Energy Improvements in Rural or Remote Areas Program.

In a seeming act of cognitive dissonance, however, the agency has canceled awards for two coal-fired power plants that the Biden administration made under those same programs. One, a $6.5 million grant to Navajo Transitional Energy Company, a tribal-owned entity that owns a stake in New Mexico’s Four Corners Generating Station, would have funded a study to determine whether adding carbon capture and storage to the plant was economically viable. The other, a $50 million grant to TDA Research that would have helped the company validate its CCS technology at Dry Fork Station, a coal plant in Wyoming, was terminated in May.

Two more may be out the window. A new internal agency list of grants labeled “terminate” that circulated this week included an $8 million grant for the utility Duke Energy to evaluate the feasibility of capturing carbon from its Edwardsport plant in Indiana, and $350 million for Project Tundra, a carbon capture demonstration project at the Milton R. Young Station in North Dakota.

“It’s not internally consistent,” Jack Andreason Cavanaugh, a global fellow at the Columbia University’s Carbon Management Research Initiative, told me. “You’re canceling coal grants, but then you’re giving $630 million to keep them open. You’re also investing a ton of time and money into nuclear — which is great, to be clear — but these small modular reactors haven’t been deployed in the United States, and part of the reason is that they’re currently not economically viable.”

The closest any company has come thus far to deploying a small modular reactor in the U.S. is NuScale, a company that planned to build its first-of-a-kind reactors in Idaho and had secured agreements to sell the power to a group of public utilities in Utah. But between 2015, when it was first proposed, and late 2023, when it died, the project’s budget tripled from $3 billion to more than $9 billion, while its scale was reduced from 600 megawatts to 462 megawatts. Not all of that was inevitable — costs rose dramatically in the final few years due to inflation. The reason NuScale ultimately pulled out of the project is that the cost of electricity it generated was going to be too high for the market to bear.

It’s unclear how heavily the DOE will weigh project financials in the application process for the $900 million for nuclear reactors. In its funding announcement, it specified that the awards would be made “solely based on technical merit.” The agency’s official solicitation paperwork, however, names “financial viability” as one of the key review criteria. Regardless, the Trump administration appears to recognize the value in funding first-of-a-kind, risky technologies when it comes to nuclear, but is not applying the same standards to direct air capture or hydrogen plants.

I asked the Department of Energy to share the criteria it used in the project review process to determine economic viability. In response, spokesperson Ben Dietderich encouraged me to read Wright’s memorandum describing the review process from May. The memo outlines what types of documentation the agency will evaluate to reach a decision, but not the criteria for making that decision.

Solomon agreed that advanced nuclear might one day meet the grid’s growing power needs, but not anytime soon. “Hopefully in the long term, this technology does become a part of our electricity system. But certainly relying on it in the short term has real risks to electricity costs,” she said. “And also reliability, in the sense that the projects might not materialize.”",https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MTc0NjUyOS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc4NDY2MDAxM30.ZBRbtMYN-esFe2DVU3koTbGX1yj_yhOG8vWXgqQ71Gw/image.jpg?width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C100%2C0%2C100,N,,2025-10-14 09:00:49.160566

With money flooding in, developers are flocking to areas where a lot of data centers are already, like Northern Virginia's Data Center Alley and parts of Texas, according to the IEA.
And in Arizona, some cities have restricted water deliveries to facilities that use a lot of water, including data centers.
Compounding the concerns of data centers' environmental and economic impacts is frustration that tech companies aren't forthcoming about their operations.
Diorio says data center companies are trying to be ""responsible partners"" in the communities where they operate.","Google recently courted the township of Franklin, Ind., so that it could construct a giant campus to house the computer hardware that powers its internet business. But the company needed to rezone more than 450 acres in the Indianapolis suburb, and residents weren't having it.

Many were concerned the facility would consume huge amounts of water and electricity while delivering few local benefits. When a lawyer representing Google confirmed at a September public meeting that the company was pulling its data center proposal, cheers erupted from sign-waving residents.

Similar fights are happening around the United States. On one side are companies pouring billions of dollars into data centers, which increasingly are being built to support artificial intelligence models that promise to transform how people live and work. On the other side are residents who worry the construction spree will have dire consequences for the environment, power prices and surrounding communities.

How tech companies and government officials handle those concerns will shape the industry's future in the U.S. and the country's competitiveness, according to analysts and academics who track the AI industry.

Local opposition ""slowing down the development of the industry or distributing it in sort of weird regional patterns is probably the most overlooked potential outcome in this conversation,"" says Joseph Majkut, director of the energy security and climate change program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

Here's what you need to know about the data center and AI boom — and what's at stake.

What are data centers?

Data centers are big buildings that house computer hardware to store and process digital information. They essentially function as the backbone of the internet. Some of the largest cover more than a million square feet — the size of more than 17 football fields.

When you read this story, or send an email or transfer money from your bank account online, you're relying on data centers scattered around the world.

And that computing power has a big environmental footprint. A typical AI data center uses as much electricity as 100,000 households, and the largest under development will consume 20 times more, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). They also suck up billions of gallons of water for systems to keep all that computer hardware cool.

Why am I hearing so much about data centers right now?

Data centers have been around for decades. But there's an investment frenzy around AI right now that's fueling a construction boom.

That growth is being driven by AI investors seeking enormous profits, thanks to the rising interest in AI from individual consumers and businesses. Within two years of ChatGPT's launch in 2022, for example, around 40% of households in the U.S. and United Kingdom reported using AI chatbots, according to the IEA. Roughly the same share of large companies were using AI last year, up from around 15% in 2020, the agency said.

Tech companies are spending hundreds of billions of dollars on data centers and AI computer chips. They're betting that more people and businesses will use the technology in the future. By 2027, AI is expected to account for 28% of the global data center market, according to Goldman Sachs, more than double its current share.

Where are data centers being built?

With money flooding in, developers are flocking to areas where a lot of data centers are already, like Northern Virginia's Data Center Alley and parts of Texas, according to the IEA. But the agency said there are also signs that development is spreading into other markets, like Las Vegas, that offer affordable land, cheap electricity from renewable power plants and industry tax incentives.

The Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis said this month that ""a potential data center boom is just getting started"" in its district, which covers Minnesota, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota and parts of Michigan and Wisconsin.

""It definitely feels like we are starting to see the rollout of what these massive investments in data centers are potentially going to start to look like on the ground,"" says Melissa Scanlan, director of the Center for Water Policy at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.

What are the benefits of AI?

Artificial intelligence generally refers to computer systems that learn to carry out tasks that traditionally required human intelligence, like reasoning and decision-making, according to NASA.

Some AI is being used to make images and videos online. The IEA says it's also being deployed in the medical field, to rapidly map protein structures for drug development; in the energy industry to quickly detect pipeline leaks and manage electricity networks; and in weather forecasting, to produce more accurate outlooks.

To remain competitive, the U.S. needs to be able to respond to what the market demands, whether it's ""more AI in the form of robotics, or we want much more in the form of digital services to make professionals more productive,"" says Majkut of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""Then there's a variety of applications in the national security, cybersecurity realm where the U.S. having a strong lead in the best [AI] models, the best chips, I think, is also something we want to pursue.""

Does it matter if the data centers that train and run those AI models are located in the U.S.? There are certainly potential economic benefits, like construction jobs and local tax revenue. But some localities are giving up a portion of those payments by offering tax breaks to lure project developers.

""Because much of the upfront investment is about physical infrastructure, having that investment here is hugely beneficial to the American economy,"" says Andrew Chien, a professor of computer science at the University of Chicago and a senior scientist at Argonne National Laboratory. The challenge for communities is figuring out how to turn those initial investments into long-term benefits, Chien adds, like high-paying jobs.

Since it doesn't take many people to operate a data center, once they're built, the facilities don't usually support many permanent jobs.

What's driving the local pushback against data centers?

Some people don't want huge industrial facilities — and all the noise and light that comes with them — changing the character of their community.

But people are also concerned about data centers depleting local water supplies for their cooling systems, driving up electricity bills and worsening climate change if the facilities rely on fossil fuel power plants for the electricity they need. The IEA says climate pollution from the power plants that run data centers could more than double by 2035.

Consider what's happening around the Great Lakes, where Scanlan of the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee says there's a flurry of data center activity. The Great Lakes can be thought of as ""a giant pitcher of water with straws going into it"" from water utilities, business and power plants in eight states and two Canadian provinces, Scanlan says. The question is, how much more water can the lakes provide for data centers and the power plants needed to run them in the coming years?

In Georgia, some residents reported problems getting drinking water from their wells after a data center was built nearby. And in Arizona, some cities have restricted water deliveries to facilities that use a lot of water, including data centers.

Dan Diorio, vice president of state policy at the Data Center Coalition, an industry group, says companies have been working to reduce how much water their facilities consume. While some data centers use evaporative cooling systems in which water is lost as steam, others rely on closed-loop systems that use less water. A Google data center in Georgia uses treated wastewater for cooling and then returns it to the Chattahoochee River, Diorio said. And there's a push for waterless cooling systems.

""It's a balance between water and electricity,"" Diorio says. ""If you use more electricity to cool, you're going to use less water. If you use more water, you'll use less electricity.""

Rising electricity bills are also a major concern as data centers spike power demand in certain areas. An analysis by the Union of Concerned Scientists recently found that in 2024, homes and businesses in Illinois, Maryland, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and West Virginia faced $4.3 billion in additional costs from transmission projects that were needed to deliver power to data centers.

Diorio says the data center industry ""is fully committed to paying its full cost of service for electricity.""

Data centers aren't the only source of new power demand. The construction of factories and increased sales of electric vehicles and home appliances like electric stoves are also increasing the country's electricity needs.

Compounding the concerns of data centers' environmental and economic impacts is frustration that tech companies aren't forthcoming about their operations. Without more transparency around water and energy consumption, Scanlan says the public doesn't have the information it needs to make informed decisions about data center development.

Diorio says data center companies are trying to be ""responsible partners"" in the communities where they operate. But they sometimes worry that sharing information about their water and energy use could give rivals a competitive edge.

Are there other challenges to data center development?

The big challenge is having enough electricity to meet rising demand.

The Trump administration has been taking steps to limit development of renewable energy projects. Industry executives and analysts say renewables are crucial to boost power supplies because the projects can be built quickly, and they generate electricity that is relatively cheap.

Pavan Venkatakrishnan, an infrastructure fellow at the Institute for Progress, says there's a ""clear conflict"" between the administration's position on renewables and its desire to accelerate data center construction.

A White House spokesperson, Kush Desai, said in a statement that AI ""cannot be beholden to unreliable sources of energy that must be heavily subsidized to be economical. The Trump administration is focused on unleashing the forms of energy — from natural gas to nuclear — that do work and that do not need consistent government subsidies to power the next Golden Age for America.""

Solar and wind power coupled with large batteries to store electricity are reliable power sources. There's also widespread agreement among energy analysts and executives that natural gas and nuclear will play an important role in meeting new electricity demand.

GM reported the loss to the Securities and Exchange Commission as what's known as an impairment charge. Impairment charges reflect assets that are not expected to bring in profits as initially expected.

GM ""made significant investments and contractual commitments in the development of electric vehicles (EVs) to help the Company’s vehicle fleet comply with emissions and fuel economy regulations that were scheduled to become increasingly stringent,"" according to a company filing.

""Following recent U.S. Government policy changes, including the termination of certain consumer tax incentives for EV purchases and the reduction in the stringency of emissions regulations, we expect the adoption rate of EVs to slow,"" according to GM's filing. ""These developments have caused us to reassess our EV capacity and manufacturing footprint.""

GM executives have continued to call electrification the company's ""North Star."" But, along with other EV makers, the company has been shaken this year by Republicans' removal of a $7,500 tax credit for EV buyers and lessees, as well as Trump's efforts to pull back federal rules limiting vehicle greenhouse gas emissions.

GM more than doubled its electric vehicle sales in the third quarter compared with the same period a year ago, largely due to drivers hoping to take advantage of the tax credits before they expired Sept. 30. Analysts predict a steep drop-off in EV sales in the coming months.

Interest in EVs among U.S. drivers, while increasing, is also doing so at a far slower pace than many in the industry expected.

Without these incentives, it’s a general consensus that EV sales will drop in the coming months, effectively squashing the lofty goals that some U.S. automakers put in place three years ago that envisioned all-electric, zero-emission lineups of new cars and trucks over the next decade.

What is uncertain is how these changes might impact major employers that make up the EV supply chain, as companies such as Ultium Cells LLC in Lordstown keep a close watch on the market.

No Word Yet on Impact

“They don’t know what’s going to be in store in the future,” says George Goranitis, president of United Auto Workers Local 1112, which represents hourly workers at Ultium’s sprawling plant.

The Inflation Reduction Act passed in 2021 during the Biden administration allowed qualified consumers to claim federal tax credits amounting to $7,500 toward the purchase of a new North American-manufactured EV sport utility vehicle with a price tag of $80,000 or less. The tax credit also covered sedans, hatchbacks, or crossovers with a sticker price of $55,000 or less. Those tax credits were set to expire at the end of 2032.

Instead, the Trump administration favored discontinuing the credits as of Sept. 30 under the budget reconciliation bill that passed Congress earlier this year.

Ultium – a joint venture between General Motors Co. and Korea-based LG Energy Solution – is among the Mahoning Valley’s largest employers, with approximately 2,200 salaried and hourly workers. The company manufactures battery cells used in several GM EV models, such as the Chevrolet Equinox, the GMC Hummer, and the Silverado.

The Equinox is an especially important end-user, since the vehicle is the No. 1-selling vehicle in GM’s EV portfolio. During the third quarter, GM reported that sales of Equinox EVs hit 25,085 units, a whopping 156.7% increase over the same period in 2024. Equinox EVs accounted for more than 25% of all 98,779 Equinox units sold during the period.

Goranitis says the plant is still very busy, spurred in part by record EV sales over the past two months. “With that $7,500 tax credit expiring, though, we’re not sure where we’re going to lie in the upcoming months,” he says.

More importantly, the Local 1112 president emphasizes there are no discussions of any layoffs at the plant. Still, there is a sense of uncertainty as to the health of the EV space.

“We’ve had good sales over the last two months, but there are just the unknowns with the tax credit being taken away,” Goranitis says. “All of the crews are working and making good quality cells for our customers,” he reports. “Hopefully, this month and within this quarter the EVs are still selling good.”

Ultium declined to comment at this time, according to a company spokesperson.

The New Normal

Some automakers have attempted to put in place incentives of their own to help offset the loss of the tax credits. According to a Reuters report Sept. 29, Ford Motor Co. and GM, for example, initially pushed out programs to retailers in which the manufacturer’s financing division would place down payments on EVs in dealers’ inventory. These down payments would then qualify for the $7,500 tax credits, and dealers would then factor those credits into the lease rate.

However, these automakers abruptly backed off the programs after Sens. Bernie Moreno, R-Ohio, and John Barrasso, R-Wyo., wrote a letter to U.S. Treasury Department Secretary John Bessent requesting that he close the tax credit loophole.

GM has said it would continue to offer a $7,500 discount without the credit until the end of October, while Ford said it would not use the tax credit but would maintain “competitive” lease payments.

Meanwhile, reactions from those customers who have purchased EVs are overwhelmingly positive, says David Sabolksy, general sales manager at Spitzer Chevrolet in North Jackson.

Sabolsky says that he’s been in the business since 1988, and he says he’s a pretty good judge when it comes to customer satisfaction or reactions to new products, and EVs have proved to be a great product. “I haven’t had one customer complain. Everyone that has purchased or leased one of these loved them,” he says.

Indeed, the rush for EVs during September was especially evident at Spitzer’s dealership on Mahoning Avenue. “At the end of the month, we sold out,” he says. “We had nothing left.” The Spitzer Auto Group also operates six additional Chevrolet stores in northeastern Ohio, and each of their showrooms were cleaned out of EVs, he says.

Fortunately, Sabolsky says the dealership has several new EVs on order, including some Chevrolet Blazers, Equinoxes, and Silverado pickups. “These are fantastic vehicles,” he says.

While it’s likely EV sales will take a hit with the loss of the tax credit, Sabolsky believes that the market will gradually rebuild as it attracts that specific niche customer. “It’s a very special buyer,” he says.

Others aren’t quite sold on the idea. Marquasha Moody, who owns a Ford Mustang Mach EV, says when it comes time to purchase a new vehicle, she’ll consider a plug-in hybrid, but not an EV again.

“Never,” she declares, after plugging her Mustang into a DC fast-charging station at a Sheetz station in Weathersfield Township. “There aren’t a whole lot of fast chargers around. This is the closest one to me, and it’s a half-hour away.”

Moreover, Moody drives an older, 2021 Mach EV model. While the vehicle is “so cool” and she likes it overall, she says it’s impractical for her driving habits. Plus, the battery capacity allows approximately 120 miles on a full charge. EV batteries on new models can travel more than 300 miles on a single charge. “If I have a gas/electric hybrid where I can switch back and forth, I’m fine with that,” she says.

Slow but Not Dead

Automakers and dealers had already anticipated the elimination of tax credits shortly after the new administration took office in January, says Joseph Yoon, consumer insights analyst for Edmunds. “We’ve been waiting for this to happen,” he says. “It wasn’t a matter of if, but when. I think automakers have had some time to think of contingency plans.”

Aside from Ford and GM’s programs, for example, Korean automaker Hyundai has announced that it would drop the retail price on some of its EV models to soften the impact.

Still, Yoon says it’s inevitable that EV sales will decline in the wake of the tax-credit rollback. “Despite the efforts of automakers, I wouldn’t be surprised of you see a slump in sales,” he says. This would especially impact a segment of the public that is wavering on whether to consider an EV, he says. Those who are undecided are less likely to adopt an EV without the help of a tax credit.

On the other hand, these tax credits were never meant to be permanent, Yoon says, and he emphasizes the incentives were intended to help stimulate adoption in an emerging industry in the United States as it developed.

What is heartening for the EV segment is that technology and development is accelerating at a rapid clip – reducing costs and improving efficiencies along the way, Yoon says. “For a lot of us, we’re used to seeing generational technology for gas cars change in the timeframe of five to 10 years,” he says. “Now, this stuff is happening in five to seven months. I think automakers are on track to get close to pricing parity sooner than we think.”

Yoon treats the disappearance of the tax credits as more of an inconvenience rather than a true hindrance to EV adoption in the long-term. “We might not get the full rollout we hoped for,” he acknowledges, “but the industry, whether the United States likes it or not, is on the slow march to electrification globally.”

That means manufacturers such as GM and Ford must manufacture electric vehicles in order to compete on the world scale, Yoon says. “It’s an inevitability,” he adds.

Public Transit

Meanwhile, efforts continue to develop an all-electric fleet for local public transportation, says Dean Harris, executive director of the Western Reserve Transit Authority, or WRTA. The organization plans to invest $5 million to transform its standard bus garage along Mahoning Avenue in Youngstown into a modernized building equipped with charging stations to initially accommodate 10 EV buses.

“We have eight big EV buses coming,” Harris says. Most likely, these new EVs will arrive sometime in the beginning for 2027, shortly after the new bus garage is finished, he says.

Harris says WRTA has four smaller EV transit vans on site, while its EV autonomous shuttle will be activated soon.

WRTA has said its ultimate objective is develop an all-electric fleet at its downtown location – an effort he considers challenging given the current funding environment.

“Our biggest concern is funding on the federal level,” he says. “The current administration – they’re not too keen on electric buses. It might take a little longer, so it’s slowing, but not dead.”",https://businessjournaldaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ultium2.png,N,,2025-10-14 09:00:58.821529

A Comprehensive Plan May be the Answer,Jameson Parker,,,,,"http://www.buildingindiana.com/stories/can-a-data-center-go-green-a-comprehensive-plan-may-be-the-answer,53423","This presents a cooling dilemma that must be addressed in order to keep the multitude of units within a data center operating correctly.
One factor that complicates the noise pollution issue is that there are no national standards for data center noise levels, and they are instead regulated by their applicable local ordinances.
Increased Energy Requirements Data centers have the potential to cripple local power grids due to their extreme energy requirements.

The key, however, to successful and sustainable data center development is a comprehensive plan to address the issues associated with their operation.","The potential for another modern technological boom is beginning to look more like a reality as Americans become more dependent on electronic devices. Rises in the popularity of remote work, the increased use of AI in serious business practices, and continued demand for data storage all play a role in driving the need for increased tech capabilities.

To meet these ever-rising needs, infrastructure must be put in place to handle the physical requirements of data storage. In the state of Indiana, there are over 70 data centers either active, under construction, or proposed. It is clear these facilities are destined to become an increasing presence in American lives. They will create jobs, improve data security, increase internet speeds, and enable businesses to expand their technological capabilities.

Nationwide, the current administration has identified that the country is lacking progress in this regard and plans to change that. The U.S. Department of Energy has recently announced the next step in the Trump administration’s plan to usher in a “golden age for American technological dominance.” The plan to accelerate data center infrastructure development ensures economic growth and increases data security.

But as with all good things, there are potential negative factors to consider.

Water consumption, noise pollution, and increased energy requirements are just a few of the concerns shared by American households located in towns close to proposed data center sites. Those concerns have been voiced in Indiana as well. This brings to the forefront questions regarding how these new data centers can be made more sustainable and environmentally friendly, reducing their impact on local inhabitants.

Water Consumption

Data centers, like all electrical devices, create heat when in operation. This presents a cooling dilemma that must be addressed in order to keep the multitude of units within a data center operating correctly. The Environmental and Energy Study Institute (EESI) estimates that larger data centers can use water in amounts totaling hundreds of millions of gallons a year. Minimal information is available on water consumption in data centers as less than half that currently operate in the United States utilize a comprehensive system for tracking water usage. Once a tracking requirement is put in place, and benchmarks are set, engineers will be able to develop plans which will make data centers more water efficient. Until tracking water consumption becomes an industry wide requirement, however, engineers can only formulate solutions based on estimates. One proposed solution involves heat dissipating layout plans where vented floors, combined heat exhaust areas, and higher ceilings will work to draw heat away from servers as efficiently as possible.

The World Economic Forum has also suggested the use of specialized cooling practices in order to relieve the stress on local water supplies involving reusing and recycling water in a closed-loop cooling system.

Noise Pollution

Noise pollution is another concern for residents regarding data centers. The cooling systems, generators, and ventilation fans of these facilities all create a significant noise footprint that can be harmful to humans and wildlife alike. In response to this issue, experts such as Josh Mahan of C&C Technology Group have begun to develop and propose noise reduction techniques to effectively reduce the sound produced by data centers.

These techniques include the use of soundproofing/acoustic treatments, cooling fan speed management, and alternative cooling solutions. Some companies are even exploring options for underwater data centers as both a cooling and noise reduction strategy. One factor that complicates the noise pollution issue is that there are no national standards for data center noise levels, and they are instead regulated by their applicable local ordinances.

Increased Energy Requirements

Data centers have the potential to cripple local power grids due to their extreme energy requirements. According to the EESI, the centers active within the United States in 2022 consumed around 17 gigawatts of power. This accounts for around 4.4% of the total energy used in the U.S. in 2022 EESI noted. The Lawrence Berkely National Laboratory’s report on data center energy usage predicts that the total energy requirement for data centers could reach almost 12% of the country’s total energy use by 2028. The U.S. Department of Energy has proposed and is working on solutions to combat this looming energy crisis by encouraging on sight power generation solutions, re-using retired coal facilities, and expediting their ultimate plan to “supercharge the electric grid.”

The development of data centers in the nation, and specifically in Indiana, will help drive forward growth and innovation in terms of expanding the capabilities and possibilities for business and industry. The key, however, to successful and sustainable data center development is a comprehensive plan to address the issues associated with their operation.",https://zeta.creativecirclecdn.com/bin/original/20251014-065432-bd5-data%20center%20GETTY.jpg,N,,2025-10-14 12:15:39.613591

Even as the federal government attempts to prop up the waning coal industry, New England’s last coal-fired power plant has ceased operations three years ahead of its planned retirement date.

What do you do when you’re laying out all this good, corporate money for well-placed bribes, and then the Brib-ee bites you in the wallet? You mean you can still get stiffed? Looks like it. NextEra Energy builds and installs solar panels (YAY!) on an industrial scale. One project on their books was a spot in Nevada that would generate enough electric power for 2 million homes (impressive!). And just to seal the deal, they made a “generous contribution” to the Ballroom Blitz Defacement Project at the White House. BUT NOW IT LOOKS LIKE Dumb Donnie took the “contribution” (pronounced “bribe”) and has turned around and screwed the company, cancelling their big Nevada project. Not even trying to hide it anymore……

NextEra is also in on the nuclear power corporate grift, as noted above.

Why did Newsom veto California’s virtual-power-plant bills?

Supporters say the bills would have helped ease the state’s energy affordability crisis while strengthening grid reliability.

On Friday, Newsom vetoed AB 44, AB 740, and SB 541, which were passed by large majorities in the state legislature last month. Each bill proposed a distinct approach to expanding the state’s use of rooftop solar, backup batteries, electric vehicles, smart thermostats, and other customer-owned energy technologies.

In three separate statements, Newsom argued that the bills would complicate state regulators’ existing efforts to use those technologies to meet clean energy and grid reliability goals.

The moves come as utility costs reach crisis levels in California; its residents now pay roughly twice the U.S. average for their power.

Most people start with a false, introjected belief that wind turbines use free energy.

The reality is that wind turbines consume huge amounts of energy from the earths climate engine, primarily wind. This has a direct relationship with the movement of high and low pressure fronts, the climate.

VW Group Sales 2025","Global demand for several Volkswagen Group brands has given the company a modest boost through the first nine months of 2025, even as sales have softened in China and North America.

Thanks in part to growing interest in Skoda, Seat, and Cupra models, the group’s total sales reached 6,604,100 vehicles, marking a slight overall increase. Yet, not every nameplate in the portfolio is enjoying the same momentum.

The primary driver behind the 1.2 percent rise in total group sales is a 2.8 percent uptick in demand for Volkswagen-badged cars, climbing from 3,396,800 units to 3,492,500, a gain of 95,700. Skoda has matched that growth almost unit for unit.

This year, Skoda has delivered 765,700 vehicles, marking a 14.1 percent increase from the 671,300 sold last year, which equates to an additional 94,400 cars. The Czech brand’s third-quarter results were even stronger, with a 15.1 percent surge as sales grew from 222,700 to 256,300.

Demand for Seat and Cupra models is also trending upward. Combined sales from January to September rose 4.1 percent to 439,500, compared with 422,100 a year ago.

Luxury Brands Lose Ground

However, the news isn’t so positive for VW’s high-end brands. This year, Audi sales have slipped 4.8 percent to 1,175,800, well down from the 1,235,600 sold last year.

Similarly, Bentley sales have dropped 2 percent from 7,400 to 7,200, while Lamborghini deliveries fell 3.2 percent from 8,400 to 8,100. Porsche posted the steepest decline in the group’s luxury lineup, with sales down 6 percent to 212,500 from 226,000.

Regional Pressures and EV Growth

The biggest negative impact on the conglomerate’s total sales is in North America and China. This year, sales in North America have fallen from 769,000 to 708,800, representing a 7.8 percent decrease. China also saw a 4 percent reduction, falling from 2,056,600 to 1,974,000.

Elsewhere, the company continues to build momentum in electrified models. Battery-electric vehicle sales climbed 42 percent year over year, rising from 506,600 to 717,500 units. Growth was particularly strong in Europe, up 78 percent, and in the United States, where sales surged 85 percent. Plug-in hybrid deliveries also expanded by 55 percent, from 193,000 to 299,000.

Public Access Counselor Jennifer Ruby made her opinion-writing debut with repeated reminders of recent limits on her powers. Lawmakers in 2024 narrowed the source material for the non-binding opinions to the “plain text” of public access laws and valid Indiana court rulings.

Ruby’s first months in office were marked by complaints of nonresponsiveness. Gov. Mike Braun’s office said that had to tackle a sizable backlog before looking at the current year’s cases.

In her first opinion, issued Sept. 24, Ruby weighed in on a dispute between one Hoosier and the New Carlisle Town Council over economic development project records.

Complainant Debra Durall sought information about water use for Amazon’s data center project — such as nondisclosure agreements and communications between a flurry of parties — and any agreements or communications about the completion of an electric vehicle battery plant under construction by General Motors and Samsung SDI.

Durall sent the town a records request late last year, on Dec. 6. The town’s attorney offered up limited documents on Jan. 2. That included a blank NDA, because the town didn’t have the signed copies, and a redacted copy of a utility service agreement.

The town didn’t have other documents she requested — like those involving officials working for the county or chamber of commerce — and said it had no agreements with GM or Samsung. It withheld other communications, citing confidential attorney work, ongoing negotiations and trade secrets.

Durall filed a formal complaint with Ruby’s office Jan. 29.

Ruby opined that Indiana law doesn’t require governments to create records they don’t have to satisfy records requests. She also defended the redactions — noting statute protects a utility customer’s confidential personal information — and the withholding of the other confidential information.

The Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission, for instance, has found that utility customer water usage data can be a confidential trade secret.

“Although Indiana statute only allows the (Office of the Public Access Counselor) to consider public access statutes and case law when issuing advisory opinions, Indiana case law provides that the IURC can be given wide discretion in matters within its jurisdiction,” Ruby wrote. “Therefore, it seems reasonable for the OPAC to consider an IURC opinion when determining whether water usage information has the characteristics outlined by Indiana case law and qualifies as trade secrets.”

She issued an opinion saying the town didn’t break public records law.

Open door dispute

A second opinion, from Oct. 2, involved a township official seemingly iced out by his own colleagues.

Green Township Board Chair George Coffey accused Township Trustee Jon Fletcher of violating meeting access laws — by not telling him soon enough about a Dec. 19 meeting that the board’s other two members had called.

Hoosiers are entitled to notice at least 48 hours before a public agency’s governing body meets. In his Jan. 9 complaint, Coffey said board members usually were notified by email, but that this time, a letter arrived in the mail on the day of the meeting.

Fletcher defended himself in responses to Ruby’s office. He argued Coffey had emailed asking if there was a meeting and that the township attorney had responded Dec. 18 with the date and time. Fletcher also included a photograph showing the letters to all three board members were mailed Dec. 16.

Ruby noted that U.S. mail often takes three-plus for delivery. She argued that that Coffey “was at a disadvantage” — the other two board members knew about the meeting since they’d called it — and that only Coffey was left “in the dark.”

The photograph itself, she added, “leads our office to believe that Respondent knew that mailing the notice and agenda would be an issue.”

She wrote that it’s “unlikely” that the mailed letter or the township attorney’s emailed response were sufficient as written notice — but added, “As the statute is silent on the timeline and method of delivery for written notice … I decline to define ‘sufficient written notice.'”

Ruby opined that Fletcher didn’t violate open door law but that the conduct “violates the spirit of” Indiana Code’s provisions for ad hoc, special meetings. She recommended that the township trustee and board consider adopting a policy to ensure that all board members get consistent notice.

PAC settles in

The opinions represent two of 34 cases that Ruby has resolved as of last week, according to office spokeswoman Stephanie McFarland.

“Resolved is a fluid term,” McFarland noted. “… Some complaints may have been withdrawn, some may have been rejected due to jurisdiction or pending litigation, or the complainant may have received their request or no longer needs it.”

Hoosiers can find links to opinions on the agency’s website once they’re uploaded.

“Receiving and resolving complaints is an ongoing process, so please continue to visit the page above throughout the year for published opinions,” McFarland wrote.

Braun appointed Ruby to the role in late March, after former PAC Luke Britt, who ran the office for about 12 years under previous Govs. Mike Pence and Eric Holcomb, resigned.

“I’d always said that if I found that my voice was getting ineffective, it was time to leave. And that might have been my sign with that legislation,” he told WFYI at the time. House Enrolled Act 1338 also made the PAC serve “at the pleasure of the governor.” Before, one could only be fired “for cause.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-47651/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/p5282173-1024x7681760451070.jpg?h=ddb1ad0c&itok=OeIwupms,N,,2025-10-14 12:14:58.093553

That’s the message that state officials from around the country are relaying to EPA. In comments on the agency’s proposal, officials argued that a patchwork of state regulations would be more expensive and less effective than keeping federal rules that limit pollution from cars and trucks.

But the alternative, they said, would be to blow a hole in state climate targets — and violate federal standards for safe air quality.

“Without reductions from vehicles, states must more and more aggressively squeeze emissions reductions from stationary sources or develop burdensome regulations of consumer products,” Minnesota state agencies wrote in comments to EPA’s proposal.

The Trump administration plans to stop regulating planet-warming pollution from cars and trucks, as part of its push to overturn the 2009 endangerment finding. The finding, which is the legal underpinning for most federal climate rules, states that greenhouse gases harm human health by driving climate change.

During EPA’s comment period for its proposal — which ended Sept. 22 — state officials urged the agency to reverse course. They pointed out that the only way to compensate for a retreat in federal vehicle standards would be to impose state-level regulations on other sectors of the economy.

Transportation is the largest source of U.S. greenhouse gases. Vehicles are also a leading source of conventional pollutants that harm public health, and which states are required to control under the Clean Air Act.

EPA’s proposal would leave in place Biden-era standards for so-called criteria pollutants that contribute to ozone, particulate matter and air toxics. But it would jettison climate rules that would accelerate the shift toward electric vehicles — a transition that promised cuts in localized pollution.

“It is going to create more pollution, and it’s going to create fewer choices for states and locals to address that pollution unless they can figure out a way around what looks like a very high bar,” said Miles Keogh, executive director of the National Association of Clean Air Agencies (NACAA).

“What it means is we’re going to get emission reductions wherever we have the authority to advance those clean air protections,” he said.

Air quality compliance at risk

States are required to submit plans to EPA for how they will meet the Clean Air Act’s National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for pollutants that harm public health — like ozone and particulate matter.

Those state implementation plans, or SIPs, detail how states will keep their pollution at or below EPA-approved limits. That task becomes harder as federal climate rules disappear — along with their co-benefits for local air pollution — and some regions see a baseline pollution spike.

Requiring states to offset the pollution previously abated by federal regulations amounts to an “unfunded mandate,” NACAA wrote in its comments to EPA.

“Various states have relied on the emission reductions provided by these federal standards to demonstrate future attainment of ozone and PM standards,” the group wrote. “The withdrawal of these standards would create a significant ‘gap’ and immediate compliance challenges for numerous nonattainment areas. States would be required to identify alternative emission reduction measures to maintain their approved implementation plans.”

The alternatives available to states, NACAA’s leaders wrote, “generally achieve emission reductions at higher per-ton costs and often face greater implementation challenges.”

A state could also lose federal highway funds if it fails to deliver on its implementation plan. That risk might be particularly acute for blue states like California under the Trump administration, which has shown a zeal for slashing federal funding to states that aren’t politically aligned with the president.

In February, EPA threatened to reject the South Coast Air Quality Management District’s plan to attain compliance with federal standards for ozone. The move — which EPA has deferred — could cost the Los Angeles region billions of dollars in federal highway funds.

The South Coast region has never been in compliance with ozone standards despite some of the toughest regulations in the country. In a February statement, the management district noted that more than 80 percent of the area’s smog-forming emissions come from motor vehicles, ships, planes and other sources the district has no regulatory authority over.

“Meeting national air quality standards is impossible unless these mobile source emissions under U.S. EPA authority are substantially reduced,” it stated.

Ann Carlson, director of the Emmett Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at UCLA, said vehicle standards are the most effective way to bring Southern California in compliance with federal ozone standards.

“If they shut down all their stationary sources and they just said, ‘OK, you can no longer operate,’ we’d still be out of compliance standards,” she said.

Congressional Republicans and the Trump administration have rescinded California’s waiver to implement its own vehicle standards — though that is still being litigated — at the same time as EPA moves to scrap its own clean car and truck rules.

“So at the same time they’re threatening to sanction [California], they’re also taking away the most effective tool California has to meet the standard,” said Carlson.

Some questioned whether the Trump administration — which has proposed loosening the NAAQS — would follow through on the lengthy process of rejecting a state’s plan and replacing it with a new abatement plan that would ultimately result in stronger limits on businesses.

“That sort of thing does happen from time to time, but it’s a long process. EPA can’t come down like a ton of bricks,” said Michael Gerrard, faculty director at Columbia University’s Sabin Center for Climate Change Law. “EPA can’t automatically jump in and require further action. Obviously, the current EPA wouldn’t anyway.”

But future EPAs might.

John Graham, a senior scientist at the Clean Air Task Force, noted that the history of the NAAQs shows that pollution limits tend to tighten over time as epidemiological studies show that lower and lower concentrations of pollutants harm public health. That could mean new parts of the country become out of compliance.

“If that standard is likely to change in the next three decades, which it could very well do, then these rules become even more important,” he said.

In response to questions, EPA issued a statement saying the agency is “following all of its statutory obligations under the Clean Air Act.”

Even if Trump’s EPA doesn’t impose sanctions on states and localities that fail to meet the NAAQS standards, citizens or nonprofits can still sue states for noncompliance. Activists are already signaling they’ll use litigation as a backstop to protect public health and the climate if EPA repeals the endangerment finding and vehicle standards.

“To the extent EPA is not doing [enforcement], I can guarantee that others will be,” said Greg Cunningham, vice president for clean energy and climate change at the Conservation Law Foundation.

‘Near zero’ chance of hitting climate goals

State commenters questioned whether they could scrape together enough emissions cuts to make up the difference if EPA gets rid of its greenhouse gas rules.

In Oregon, where state law requires deep emissions cuts by 2050, officials said federal vehicle standards had allowed the state to decarbonize while still growing the economy. Trying to achieve the same result through state regulations, they said, would harm the state’s growth for a fraction of the benefits.

“Without federal greenhouse gas emissions standards, Oregon would be left with a patchwork of state-level policies that cannot achieve the same extent of reductions in emissions,” Oregon Department of Environmental Quality Director Leah Feldon wrote in comments to EPA.

“Removing these standards would make it far more difficult, if not impossible, to achieve the state’s legally binding emission reduction targets,” she wrote.

In Washington state, where a cap-and-invest system covers the state’s biggest polluters, some officials warned that state law would force the state to balance a rise in vehicle pollution by clamping down on other, nontransportation sectors. But state agencies expect to get less juice from the squeeze.

“The federal standards are already not stringent enough to meet Washington’s greenhouse gas limits — in this scenario, if they are repealed as proposed, our ability to meet our limits would be near zero,” Washington state agencies wrote to EPA.

North Carolina officials warned that worsening air pollution would have “severe consequences” for public health as well as the state’s economic competitiveness.

“One of the first questions corporations ask when they are evaluating the location of a manufacturing facility in the state is if the area in which they are evaluating complies with all the NAAQS,” wrote Michael Abraczinskas, director of the Division of Air Quality at the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality.

“For Mecklenburg County and adjacent counties, we are proud to say that, yes, the area complies with all the NAAQS, and we intend to keep it that way,” he wrote.

Turning to stationary sources

States and regional authorities can’t regulate mobile sources directly — at least, not unless the courts ultimately overturn EPA’s repeal of California’s waiver.

But there are new strategies states and local regulatory authorities may pursue to limit vehicle emissions indirectly.

EPA last year allowed the South Coast regional authority to include its “indirect source rule” for warehouses in California’s state implementation plan to decrease nitrogen oxides and particulates. Warehouses — like rail yards and ports — are hubs for high-emitting long-haul trucks that spew criteria and climate pollution. The rule requires warehouses to formulate plans to reduce overall emissions via installing electric vehicle charging infrastructure, limiting trips by diesel-burning trucks and other options.

It’s less efficient than fleetwide vehicle emissions standards, and more costly for warehouse owners. But its a strategy states and regional authorities may use to limit pollution at other warehouses, rail yards and ports around the country. And while EPA had to sign off on adding it to California’s SIP, states and regional authorities don’t require federal permission to regulate local infrastructure.

States also have wide leeway to electrify their own fleets of government vehicles. Subsidizing EVs, building charging stations and other incentives also remain available.

The Clean Air Act allows states to regulate stationary sources, like manufacturing, oil and gas development and power generation. But that’s complicated by tight electricity demand, high prices and public concern about the economy.

“States can impose all kinds of requirements on their stationary sources,” Gerrard said. “But often that’ll chase companies out of town, and cause electric rates to go up and lots of other bad things that states want to avoid.”

The Edison Electric Institute, which represents investor-owned utilities, filed comments urging EPA not to repeal the greenhouse gas endangerment finding. While the draft rule doesn’t directly undo Biden-era power plant carbon rules, EPA is working separately to roll those back.

EEI noted that repealing the scientific finding would leave the power sector unregulated for climate change at the federal level.

But it would do nothing to roll back state climate laws.

“Many EEI members serve customers in states with existing state policies for [greenhouse gas] emissions,” wrote EEI regulatory lead Alex Bond. Those policies are already shaping those companies’ investments, he said.

“Settled” federal standards would do more to lessen regulatory uncertainty, he said, than a regulatory void at the federal level that would be filled with “competing and conflicting regulations through a patchwork of state regulations.”",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/82/36/f10385374e98a4fd127a56c8e8c8/california-gas-appliances-66606.jpg,N,,2025-10-14 08:02:47.528033

The Detroit automaker Tuesday morning in a public filing said $1.2 billion of the impact will be non-cash, special charges as a result of adjustments to its EV capacity. The other $400 million in cash is primarily related to contract cancellation fees and commercial settlements associated with EV-related investments, according to the filing.

The automaker said its reassessment of its EV capacity and manufacturing footprint is ""ongoing,"" signaling additional charges could be announced for future quarters.

The charges will be reported as special items when GM reports its third quarter results on Oct. 21. That means they will impact the automaker's net results but not its adjusted earnings, or EBIT-adjusted, which are closely watched by Wall Street.

GM was among the earliest to invest billions of dollars in an EV market that didn't culminate. At one point, the company was planning to invest $30 billion by this year in EVs, including dozens of new models and capacity for battery production.

The charges come amid changing regulations regarding EVs — particularly the end of $7,500 in federal tax credits — under the Trump administration as compared to President Joe Biden, who championed the vehicles.

""Following recent U.S. Government policy changes, including the termination of certain consumer tax incentives for EV purchases and the reduction in the stringency of emissions regulations, we expect the adoption rate of EVs to slow,"" GM said in the filing.

John Murphy, a longtime analyst with Bank of America, warned earlier this year of such write-downs for automakers that invested heavily in EVs.

""There's a lot of tough decisions that are going to need to be made,"" Murphy, who's now with Haig Partners, said in June during an event for Bank of America's ""Car Wars"" report. ""Based on the study, I think we're going to see multibillion-dollar write-downs that are flooding the headlines for the next few years.""

GM's EV pullback charges come more than a year after crosstown rival Ford Motor announced a $1.9 billion impact from its EV plans.

Ford's included about $400 million for the write-down of manufacturing assets, as well as additional expenses and cash expenditures of up to $1.5 billion that included canceling a large, electric three-row SUV that was already far in development and delaying production of its next-generation electric full-size pickup truck.

GM, which offers the most EV models in the U.S., has made significant gains this year in EV sales, but the size of the market is niche compared with expectations at the beginning of this decade.

Motor Intelligence reported that the Detroit automaker went from an 8.7% market share in all-electric vehicles to begin this year to 13.8% through the third quarter – topping Hyundai Motor, including Kia, at 8.6% through September.

Why it matters: States differ in offering financial rewards and/or charging higher fees for EV users. That variation reflects an industry in flux, as policymakers try to balance environmental goals with the need for more funding to pay for roads and infrastructure.

Catch up quick: Biden-era federal tax credits on EV purchases — up to $7,500 for new EVs and up to $4,000 for pre-owned EVs — were killed by Congress, effective Sept. 30.

Chinese manufacturer BYD serves as a prominent case study in this technological transformation, using AI-powered systems to underpin its rapid global expansion and solidify its position in competitive markets like the United Kingdom.

This approach has supported BYD’s growth from producing 500,000 vehicles in 2017 to a projected four million by 2024.

BYD's performance in the UK, where it sold 11,271 vehicles in September, a substantial increase from the 1,150 units in the same month last year, could show the effectiveness of its strategy. This growth has given BYD a 3.6% market share in the UK.

""We want to see steady growth, and we want people to see we are a technology company,"" says Bono Ge, Country Manager for the UK & Ireland at BYD. Bono has also stated BYD's intention to introduce its ultrafast charging technology to the UK and Europe next year.

AI-powered quality control

A key factor in BYD's manufacturing process is the extensive deployment of AI for quality control, particularly in battery production.

BYD has reported a 40% reduction in battery defects and a 20% improvement in average battery lifespan.

These gains are attributed to AI-powered systems that analyse real-time sensor data from production lines.

This strategy extends to the development of bespoke AI hardware. BYD's subsidiary BYD Semiconductor is creating AI chips designed to compete with offerings from Nvidia and Horizon.

These chips reportedly achieve 80 trillion operations per second, potentially moving BYD closer to purely domestic production.

To support this, BYD has also partnered with semiconductor manufacturers TSMC and MediaTek to develop a 4-nanometre smart cockpit chip.

An internal analysis of the firm’s manufacturing processes suggests that ""a BYD car comparable to the Model 3 costs 15% less than production in Tesla's Shanghai gigafactory.""

Data ecosystem and intelligent driving

Beyond the factory floor, AI is integral to the vehicles themselves. In February, BYD launched its ‘Intelligent Driving for All’ initiative, which equips all new vehicles with advanced driver assistance systems as standard.

The strategy uses the ‘God's Eye’ system, a three-tiered platform that is deployed across all vehicle price points.

This approach differs from competitors like Tesla, whose Full Self-Driving system is an optional extra. By making these features standard, BYD can gather vast amounts of data from its entire fleet.

""If the data from one car is a drop of water, BYD possesses an ocean,"" Wang said at the technology's launch event.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/8ad5b570507d071485c6237721707326:02d5a2e4b3556deb1b89c22341a3e150/byd-manufactures-millions-of-vehicles-every-year.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-10-14 09:01:18.709435

But there are big energy and environmental risks - WVPE,Michael Copley,,,,,https://www.wvpe.org/npr-news/2025-10-14/data-centers-are-booming-but-there-are-big-energy-and-environmental-risks,"Data centers are big buildings that house computer hardware to store and process digital information.
With money flooding in, developers are flocking to areas where a lot of data centers are already, like Northern Virginia's Data Center Alley and parts of Texas, according to the IEA.
And in Arizona, some cities have restricted water deliveries to facilities that use a lot of water, including data centers.
Compounding the concerns of data centers' environmental and economic impacts is frustration that tech companies aren't forthcoming about their operations.
Diorio says data center companies are trying to be ""responsible partners"" in the communities where they operate.","Google recently courted the township of Franklin, Ind., so that it could construct a giant campus to house the computer hardware that powers its internet business. But the company needed to rezone more than 450 acres in the Indianapolis suburb, and residents weren't having it.

Many were concerned the facility would consume huge amounts of water and electricity while delivering few local benefits. When a lawyer representing Google confirmed at a September public meeting that the company was pulling its data center proposal, cheers erupted from sign-waving residents.

Similar fights are happening around the United States. On one side are companies pouring billions of dollars into data centers, which increasingly are being built to support artificial intelligence models that promise to transform how people live and work. On the other side are residents who worry the construction spree will have dire consequences for the environment, power prices and surrounding communities.

How tech companies and government officials handle those concerns will shape the industry's future in the U.S. and the country's competitiveness, according to analysts and academics who track the AI industry.

Local opposition ""slowing down the development of the industry or distributing it in sort of weird regional patterns is probably the most overlooked potential outcome in this conversation,"" says Joseph Majkut, director of the energy security and climate change program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

Here's what you need to know about the data center and AI boom — and what's at stake.

What are data centers?

Data centers are big buildings that house computer hardware to store and process digital information. They essentially function as the backbone of the internet. Some of the largest cover more than a million square feet — the size of more than 17 football fields.

When you read this story, or send an email or transfer money from your bank account online, you're relying on data centers scattered around the world.

And that computing power has a big environmental footprint. A typical AI data center uses as much electricity as 100,000 households, and the largest under development will consume 20 times more, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). They also suck up billions of gallons of water for systems to keep all that computer hardware cool.

Why am I hearing so much about data centers right now?

Data centers have been around for decades. But there's an investment frenzy around AI right now that's fueling a construction boom.

That growth is being driven by AI investors seeking enormous profits, thanks to the rising interest in AI from individual consumers and businesses. Within two years of ChatGPT's launch in 2022, for example, around 40% of households in the U.S. and United Kingdom reported using AI chatbots, according to the IEA. Roughly the same share of large companies were using AI last year, up from around 15% in 2020, the agency said.

Tech companies are spending hundreds of billions of dollars on data centers and AI computer chips. They're betting that more people and businesses will use the technology in the future. By 2027, AI is expected to account for 28% of the global data center market, according to Goldman Sachs, more than double its current share.

Where are data centers being built?

With money flooding in, developers are flocking to areas where a lot of data centers are already, like Northern Virginia's Data Center Alley and parts of Texas, according to the IEA. But the agency said there are also signs that development is spreading into other markets, like Las Vegas, that offer affordable land, cheap electricity from renewable power plants and industry tax incentives.

The Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis said this month that ""a potential data center boom is just getting started"" in its district, which covers Minnesota, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota and parts of Michigan and Wisconsin.

""It definitely feels like we are starting to see the rollout of what these massive investments in data centers are potentially going to start to look like on the ground,"" says Melissa Scanlan, director of the Center for Water Policy at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.

What are the benefits of AI?

Artificial intelligence generally refers to computer systems that learn to carry out tasks that traditionally required human intelligence, like reasoning and decision-making, according to NASA.

Some AI is being used to make images and videos online. The IEA says it's also being deployed in the medical field, to rapidly map protein structures for drug development; in the energy industry to quickly detect pipeline leaks and manage electricity networks; and in weather forecasting, to produce more accurate outlooks.

To remain competitive, the U.S. needs to be able to respond to what the market demands, whether it's ""more AI in the form of robotics, or we want much more in the form of digital services to make professionals more productive,"" says Majkut of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""Then there's a variety of applications in the national security, cybersecurity realm where the U.S. having a strong lead in the best [AI] models, the best chips, I think, is also something we want to pursue.""

Does it matter if the data centers that train and run those AI models are located in the U.S.? There are certainly potential economic benefits, like construction jobs and local tax revenue. But some localities are giving up a portion of those payments by offering tax breaks to lure project developers.

""Because much of the upfront investment is about physical infrastructure, having that investment here is hugely beneficial to the American economy,"" says Andrew Chien, a professor of computer science at the University of Chicago and a senior scientist at Argonne National Laboratory. The challenge for communities is figuring out how to turn those initial investments into long-term benefits, Chien adds, like high-paying jobs.

Since it doesn't take many people to operate a data center, once they're built, the facilities don't usually support many permanent jobs.

What's driving the local pushback against data centers?

Some people don't want huge industrial facilities — and all the noise and light that comes with them — changing the character of their community.

But people are also concerned about data centers depleting local water supplies for their cooling systems, driving up electricity bills and worsening climate change if the facilities rely on fossil fuel power plants for the electricity they need. The IEA says climate pollution from the power plants that run data centers could more than double by 2035.

Consider what's happening around the Great Lakes, where Scanlan of the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee says there's a flurry of data center activity. The Great Lakes can be thought of as ""a giant pitcher of water with straws going into it"" from water utilities, business and power plants in eight states and two Canadian provinces, Scanlan says. The question is, how much more water can the lakes provide for data centers and the power plants needed to run them in the coming years?

In Georgia, some residents reported problems getting drinking water from their wells after a data center was built nearby. And in Arizona, some cities have restricted water deliveries to facilities that use a lot of water, including data centers.

Dan Diorio, vice president of state policy at the Data Center Coalition, an industry group, says companies have been working to reduce how much water their facilities consume. While some data centers use evaporative cooling systems in which water is lost as steam, others rely on closed-loop systems that use less water. A Google data center in Georgia uses treated wastewater for cooling and then returns it to the Chattahoochee River, Diorio said. And there's a push for waterless cooling systems.

""It's a balance between water and electricity,"" Diorio says. ""If you use more electricity to cool, you're going to use less water. If you use more water, you'll use less electricity.""

Rising electricity bills are also a major concern as data centers spike power demand in certain areas. An analysis by the Union of Concerned Scientists recently found that in 2024, homes and businesses in Illinois, Maryland, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and West Virginia faced $4.3 billion in additional costs from transmission projects that were needed to deliver power to data centers.

Diorio says the data center industry ""is fully committed to paying its full cost of service for electricity.""

Data centers aren't the only source of new power demand. The construction of factories and increased sales of electric vehicles and home appliances like electric stoves are also increasing the country's electricity needs.

Compounding the concerns of data centers' environmental and economic impacts is frustration that tech companies aren't forthcoming about their operations. Without more transparency around water and energy consumption, Scanlan says the public doesn't have the information it needs to make informed decisions about data center development.

Diorio says data center companies are trying to be ""responsible partners"" in the communities where they operate. But they sometimes worry that sharing information about their water and energy use could give rivals a competitive edge.

Are there other challenges to data center development?

The big challenge is having enough electricity to meet rising demand.

The Trump administration has been taking steps to limit development of renewable energy projects. Industry executives and analysts say renewables are crucial to boost power supplies because the projects can be built quickly, and they generate electricity that is relatively cheap.

Pavan Venkatakrishnan, an infrastructure fellow at the Institute for Progress, says there's a ""clear conflict"" between the administration's position on renewables and its desire to accelerate data center construction.

A White House spokesperson, Kush Desai, said in a statement that AI ""cannot be beholden to unreliable sources of energy that must be heavily subsidized to be economical. The Trump administration is focused on unleashing the forms of energy — from natural gas to nuclear — that do work and that do not need consistent government subsidies to power the next Golden Age for America.""

Solar and wind power coupled with large batteries to store electricity are reliable power sources. There's also widespread agreement among energy analysts and executives that natural gas and nuclear will play an important role in meeting new electricity demand. But they say those technologies can't be deployed quickly enough at scale right now to meet the country's immediate needs.

Only then can the agency propose a national primary drinking water standard and goal for the contaminant.
The Safe Drinking Water Act stipulates that changes to the standards can only be more protective, not less.","This story is published in partnership with The Assembly, Inside Climate News, and WHQR. It is the first in an ongoing series about the PFAS crisis in North Carolina, “Forever War.”

OAK ISLAND, N.C.—Emily Donovan stood before 100 people in the pews at Ocean View United Methodist Church in a small seaside town in Brunswick County, North Carolina. It was May, the start of beach season. She had invited a scientist to speak about the astronomical levels of PFAS—nicknamed “forever chemicals”—that had been detected in sea foam four miles away.

But before she began her presentation, Donovan, a co-founder of Clean Cape Fear, had to deliver some bad news. That morning, Lee Zeldin, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency administrator appointed by President Donald Trump, had announced his intention to rescind drinking water regulations for several types of PFAS compounds.

The rollbacks included GenX, one of dozens within a family of chemicals that have contaminated the region’s drinking water and have been linked to disorders of the liver, kidneys and the immune system, as well as low birth weight and cancer.

Donovan felt devastated and enraged.

“Churches in Brunswick County baptize their babies in PFAS-contaminated tap water,” Donovan told the crowd. “We fought so hard. And now our hard work is getting rolled back.”

In 2013, scientists first discovered seven different types of PFAS in the Lower Cape Fear River, the drinking water source for several public utilities in the region. The insidious chemicals were eluding traditional water treatment systems and flowing through the taps of hundreds of thousands of people.

The scientists traced many of the compounds to Chemours’ Fayetteville Works plant, 80 miles upstream. State and federal documents show that for 40 years Chemours and its predecessor, DuPont had been quietly tainting the drinking water of a half-million North Carolinians.

It took several years for that information to reach the public, but once it did, Donovan and her fellow environmental activists, as well as public interest lawyers, state legislators and local residents, started urging the EPA and state officials to regulate the compounds.

Many activists went to Congress and to the courts. Clean Cape Fear even pleaded its case to United Nations special rapporteurs on human rights, who concluded last year that PFAS contamination coming from the Chemours facility constituted “a business-related human rights abuse.”

Meanwhile, the scope of the contamination expanded throughout the state. Scientists found PFAS in fresh vegetables and fish, eggs and beer. Pine needles, honey and house dust. Landfills, compost, and sewage sludge.

Blood of horses. Blood of dogs. Their own blood.

“Churches in Brunswick County baptize their babies in PFAS-contaminated tap water.”

— Emily Donovan, Clean Cape Fear

Finally, the environmental advocates prevailed. In 2024, Michael Regan, North Carolina’s former top environmental regulator who’d become President Joe Biden’s EPA administrator, announced his agency would regulate five types of PFAS, including GenX, in drinking water.

The celebration was brief.

Now, here was Trump back in the White House, and Zeldin—with support from the chemical industry—began dismantling those hard-won protections.

And now, here were North Carolinians, prepared to battle anew for the health of their communities. To stop Chemours from dumping GenX in landfills. To force the company to pay for drinking water it had defiled. To halt the expansion of the Fayetteville Works plant.

“This is a motivator, not a deflator,” Donovan said, a few weeks after Zeldin’s announcement. “We’re going to continue to fight this, now, more than ever.”

2013-2016: A Movement Is Born

The Cape Fear River begins 200 miles upstream from Wilmington, at the confluence of the Haw and the Deep rivers.

On its journey to the Atlantic Ocean, the Cape Fear rambles through forests of loblolly pine and courses under plains of concrete. About halfway to the sea, where the river grazes Chemours’ Fayetteville Works plant, the company was releasing PFAS into the waterway.

Had it not been for Detlef Knappe and several scientists, including Mark Strynar and Andy Lindstrom of the EPA, Chemours could still be doing so.

Knappe is a distinguished professor of civil, construction, and environmental engineering at N.C. State University in Raleigh. He grew up in southern Germany in the small town of Freudenstadt, which translates to “City of Joy.”

Now a lean, ruddy man in his 50s, Knappe has retained shards of his German accent, but its edges have been softened, like rocks weathered by water. He is quiet and modest, and never boasts that he was among the scientists whose findings launched an environmental movement.

In 2013, Knappe and the EPA scientists were curious about a new chemical that DuPont had been manufacturing at Fayetteville Works. It was a replacement for PFOA, another “forever chemical” used in stain-resistant carpet, waterproof apparel and nonstick cookware, which the company agreed to phase out by 2015 due to its health risks.

Coincidentally, the EPA scientists soon stumbled across a pamphlet from DuPont that named the mystery chemical: GenX.

Knappe had preserved water samples from the Cape Fear River for a different project. When the scientists analyzed the samples for GenX, they found average levels in Wilmington at 600 parts per trillion, with spikes reaching 4,500 ppt.

“We all felt that was really high,” Knappe said. “But how do you communicate that information? There’s this mystery chemical, GenX, and we weren’t aware of much information about its toxicity.”

The scientists were right: The levels were as much as 450 times what later became the drinking water standard. Their analysis found GenX was passing through the treatment system at the Sweeney Water Treatment Plant in Wilmington. Residents were drinking, bathing and playing in contaminated water.

As the scientists worked on a paper that contained their new findings, the EPA lowered the health advisory for PFOA and another forever chemical, PFOS, to 70 ppt. While the advisory didn’t apply to GenX, the scientists were concerned about the potential health effects of the new compound, given its high levels in the drinking water.

We have to publish that paper now, Knappe thought.

When the paper came out in November 2016, he shared the findings with state regulators and utilities, but without toxicity data, no one knew what to make of it.

Then a freelance reporter for the Wilmington Star-News, Vaughn Hagerty, happened upon the scientific paper online. On June 6, 2017, he broke the story of the scientists’ findings.

People protested in the streets. Residents mobilized on Facebook.

“What was surprising and gratifying was the impact that article made,” Knappe said. “And how, maybe for a moment, politics stopped.”

2017-2018: Clean Cape Fear

Donovan is in her 40s, with chin-length, dark brown hair and glasses. At 5 foot 10, she is swan-like and often towers over a crowd. She worked in corporate marketing for a decade, then moved to Leland, in Brunswick County, from Charlotte with her husband in 2009. At the time, she was pregnant with twins, a boy and girl.

She became a stay-at-home mom and for seven years taught Bible study at Little Chapel on the Boardwalk in Wrightsville Beach. After noticing some children were praying for the health of their loved ones, Donovan said she heard God call her to become an environmental advocate.

In June, she and several concerned residents, including Cape Fear Riverkeeper Kemp Burdette, social activist and retired obstetrician Dr. Jessica Cannon and former Wilmington Mayor Harper Peterson, gathered at Peterson’s wooden dining room table to discuss how to handle the crisis.

The demonstrations had been powerful, but diffuse. The activists decided they had to channel the public’s anxiety into a coherent movement. They called the group Clean Cape Fear.

In Raleigh, Michael Regan had been the head of the N.C. Department of Environmental Quality for just six months. He was homegrown, having been raised in Goldsboro, about an hour southeast of the capital. He graduated from the historically Black N.C. A&T University in Greensboro before heading to Washington, D.C., for an advanced degree in public administration.

Water pollution and obscure contaminants weren’t Regan’s specialty. He had worked in air quality and clean energy programs at the EPA, and later at the Environmental Defense Fund.

Now as head of DEQ, Regan was facing the type of daunting challenge that can define a leader’s legacy.

2017-2018: Stymied at the Legislature

Republican State Rep. Ted Davis Jr. is 75, a trim man with wire-rimmed glasses. A former state and federal prosecutor, he grew up in New Hanover County and drank water from the Cape Fear River for most of his life.

Like most people, Davis knew nothing about PFAS. But as an advisory member of the Joint Environmental Review Commission, he hoped his colleagues would support funding for local governments to address pollutants, monitor the river’s quality and hold hearings on the PFAS contamination.

Yet after a contentious commission meeting in 2017, the Senate declined to hold another one.

Undeterred, Davis approached Republican Tim Moore, then the House speaker, and asked to form a special committee. “I said, ‘Tim, I don’t give a damn whether the Senate is going to support it or not,’” Davis recalled. “‘This is too important.’”

Davis, who became the senior chairman of the resulting House Select Committee on North Carolina River Quality, presided over seven lengthy meetings with toxicologists, state regulators, scientists and other experts.

Still, several legislators fell in line with the industry’s talking points. State Rep. William Brisson, a former Democrat from Bladen County who had switched parties, downplayed the compounds’ toxicity. “It’s not like the mice fell over dead when they were injected with GenX,” he said at the committee hearing.

Those hearings prompted Davis to introduce the Water Safety Act. But only one of the bill’s provisions became law: a $450,000 allocation to the Cape Fear Public Utility Authority to test the finished drinking water and to install a temporary advanced treatment system was eventually folded into the state budget.

On the Democratic side, state Rep. Deb Butler, an attorney who represents New Hanover County, was having even less luck than Davis in advancing PFAS legislation. Some of her bills called for an outright ban on PFAS, including their use in firefighting foam and consumer packaging. Most of the measures died in committee; some never got a hearing.

“One of the things I’ve learned in the last eight years is that things that shouldn’t be politicized are, and the environment is one of them,” Butler said earlier this summer. “We all drink the water and we breathe the air, and some of us just don’t seem to care about cleaning it up.”

2018: A Prayer Circle and Cancer

Brian Long, the plant manager at Fayetteville Works, paced the floor before more than 100 people at Faith Tabernacle Christian Center. He wore an orange Chemours pin on the lapel of his sport jacket.

It was a cloudy evening in June 2018. The company was hosting a public event in St. Pauls, a small town two hours from Wilmington, to assuage the community’s fears about GenX.

“There’s been a lot reported on this compound,” Long told the frustrated, angry crowd. “We have decades of evidence and studies that suggest this compound—at the levels we see in our environment—do not cause health risks.”

EPA and academic scientists soon found that even at low levels, GenX was associated with harm to the liver, kidneys and immune system.

Rates of thyroid cancer declined in New Hanover and Brunswick counties, according to National Cancer Institute data from 2017 to 2021, the most recent figures available. However, those two counties still rank second and fifth, respectively, for thyroid cancer rates in North Carolina, data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show.

Kidney cancer rates rose in Brunswick and Pender counties during that time, according to federal data. Pender County leads North Carolina in rates of testicular cancer.

Local residents had begun reporting their experiences with cancer and other health problems. Some risk factors, such as age and genetics, make it difficult to establish causation between their illnesses and exposure to PFAS. Yet thyroid, testicular, brain and other cancers have been linked to the compounds.

New Hanover and Brunswick counties had some of the highest rates of thyroid cancer in North Carolina, according to the state cancer registry. Rates of testicular cancer were also significantly elevated in nearby Pender County, which later detected high levels of PFAS in its drinking water.

Several advocates felt illnesses in their family might be linked to PFAS exposure. Donovan’s husband, David, had been diagnosed with a benign brain tumor that caused him to go blind until a surgeon removed it.

Dana Sargent, then with Cape Fear River Watch, was worried about her older brother, Grant Raymond, who had been diagnosed nine months before with a malignant brain tumor. He had been exposed to high levels of PFAS while a U.S. Marine and throughout his career as a Chicago firefighter. Doctors had given him less than five years to live. He was only 45.

Sargent, now 51, is from the Chicago area and arrived in North Carolina by way of California and Washington, D.C. She is short and petite, with long, flowing brown hair. She specializes in research, but her other quality is bluntness.

She attended the meeting, which began with a prayer circle that included Chemours. “It was asinine and repulsive to hold a meeting in rural North Carolina, in a church—to help shut people up,” she said. “They knew what they were doing.”

One man in the second row told Long that because of contamination in his neighborhood, he couldn’t sell his house.

“I understand you’re frustrated,” Long said, three times.

The man became angry, and as law enforcement led him out of the church, he told Long, “You have defiled the house of God.”

2018-2019: Chemours Cuts a Deal

Here’s Kemp Burdette, the Cape Fear Riverkeeper, on how to snag an alligator to test its blood for PFAS:

Get a treble hook, the kind used to catch a marlin.

Cast the rod over the alligator, which should be lying in the water. Reel in the line until the hook reaches the alligator, then jerk it with all your strength.

Steer the tired alligator to the bank.

Then, everyone jumps on the alligator (multiple humans, if possible).

Finally, tape the alligator’s mouth shut. Stick a 20-gauge needle at the base of its skull to draw 15 milliliters of blood.

Burdette helped NC State University and EPA scientists apprehend alligators in the Cape Fear River and several nearby lakes to test their blood for PFAS. Alligators can live long lives in contaminated water, so they can serve as models for detecting human health problems.

The scientists sampled the blood of 75 alligators and found 14 types of PFAS at concentrations similar to levels found in the blood of Wilmington residents. High levels of PFOS would later be found in several species of freshwater fish, prompting the state health department to advise people to eat no more than seven servings a year. Pregnant women should eat none.

“It was asinine and repulsive to hold a meeting in rural North Carolina, in a church—to help shut people up.”

— Dana Sargent

It had been more than a year since the contamination became public, and Burdette was fed up with what he viewed as DEQ’s inertia and Chemours’ negligence. He pestered the attorneys at the Southern Environmental Law Center: We’ve got to do something.

Geoff Gisler, then a senior attorney at SELC, began to strategize, but it soon became apparent to him what needed to happen.

“We sued,” Burdette said.

SELC alleged DEQ was failing to uphold the North Carolina Constitution, a section of which obligates the agency to protect the environment and human health from the effects of pollution. The law center also filed suit against Chemours, alleging it had violated the federal Clean Water Act.

By the fall of 2018, DEQ and Chemours were trying to make a deal.

“In some ways it was a very sterile process,” Burdette recalled. “But it was also very tense. I felt like we didn’t need to do a whole lot of negotiating because we were right. They had poisoned the drinking water supply, and the state had let them do it. I didn’t want to compromise, and I think we did as little of that as we possibly could.”

By February 2019, the parties had crafted a consent order. Among the many provisions in the 46-page document was a requirement for the company to sample private wells for a dozen types of PFAS and to provide clean water to households whose wells were contaminated above certain thresholds.

No longer could Chemours discharge wastewater into the river as part of its manufacturing processes. No longer could the company expel hundreds of tons of GenX from its smokestacks; it had to reduce the emissions by 99.9 percent.

DEQ, too, had specific duties to hold Chemours accountable, including levying a record $13 million civil penalty.

“I think it’s been a tremendous success,” Gisler said in a recent interview. “It was never the final word and would never fix all the problems, but it’s a big step in the right direction. It’s our view that the polluter has to pay, and that hasn’t been happening, because the state and the EPA had not been enforcing it.”

In retrospect, Sargent, the former head of Cape Fear River Watch, wishes the consent order had been tougher. But when the document was finalized, few, if anyone, could foresee the scientific advances in detection methods.

“We didn’t know then that there were 350 types of PFAS coming out of Chemours,” Sargent said. “There’s still people falling through the cracks.”

Some of those people lived in Brunswick County, where private drinking water wells and river water entering the Northwest treatment plant were contaminated. That plant served homes, businesses and schools, including the one Donovan’s young children attended.

“It was never the final word and would never fix all the problems, but it’s a big step in the right direction.”

— Geoff Gisler, former SELC senior attorney

“It sickens me to think I may have hurt my children by letting them drink that tap water,” Donovan testified before the U.S. House Oversight Subcommittee in 2019. She urged its members to pass a law banning the manufacture of the compounds. “I will forever wonder if one day that will cause them medical harm.”

At the hearing, she named her friends—Sarah, Tom, Kara—all young, all with rare or recurrent cancers.

“I am begging you to engage your humanity, to find the moral courage,” Donovan said. Her voice cracked. “To protect the most valuable economic resource—human life. Because it’s already too late for some of us.”

Some of Donovan’s friends have since died. “They left kids who are questioning their faith, wondering why God hates them so much that they gave their parents cancer and didn’t save them,” Donovan said. “The people who fought so hard to get answers of what caused their cancer died not knowing.”

Sargent’s brother, Grant, was among them. In December 2019, two years and three months after his diagnosis, his brain tumor killed him.

2021-2022: Quest for Accountability

One spring day, Donovan spotted odd-looking sea foam near the Ocean Crest Pier in Oak Island, a popular spot for saltwater fishing. She learned that the best time to find the foam is after a storm or on extremely windy days, when the water is agitated. She scanned live beach video feeds and local social media chats, where people posted photos of the foam blooms.

Her sightings, as it turned out, were not isolated to the coast. State officials had seen similar foam at 15 other spots, including in Falls Lake near Raleigh and a stream in the southern foothills of the Appalachian mountains.

Eventually Donovan collected samples from 13 sites in the Cape Fear River and along the coast, including near airports and military installations, which often use firefighting foam that contains the compounds. NC State scientists began an analysis, a process that took more than a year.

In Raleigh, Davis, the Republican representative from New Hanover County who had successfully negotiated for GenX funding, was still trying to pass legislation to hold Chemours accountable. He sponsored a new bill, “PFAS Pollution and Polluter Liability,” that would require that polluters who discharged PFAS into a public water system pay for treatment costs to remove the compounds.

“I’m going to fight for my constituency,” Davis said at a hearing of the House Judiciary Committee. “If the gentleman from Chemours really wants to show they care, why don’t they pay to make the water safe from the contamination they put in that river?”

The legislation was referred to the Agriculture and Environment Committee, but, like several PFAS-related bills before it, never received a hearing.

In the same legislative session, Butler, the New Hanover County attorney now in her second term as a representative, sponsored House Bill 444. It was more aggressive than Davis’ bill and extended liability to dischargers of the compounds, not only the manufacturers.

The bill had more than 20 co-sponsors, including a Republican, Frank Iler of Brunswick County. It never received a committee hearing.

2024: At the EPA, Regan Delivers

Michael Regan had overseen North Carolina’s PFAS crisis as DEQ secretary, but a hostile legislature and an indolent EPA under the first Trump administration hamstrung much of his effort to change policy. In 2021, Biden empowered him to take steps to protect the nation’s drinking water in his new role as EPA administrator.

Yet three years had passed since Regan had joined the EPA, and environmental advocates were becoming impatient with what they viewed as the agency’s sluggish progress on regulating PFAS.

Then, on a warm morning in April, Regan returned to North Carolina, to Fayetteville, the Cape Fear River flowing behind him.

He had arrived to announce the first legally enforceable maximum concentration levels for PFOA and PFOS at 4 parts per trillion, and for GenX, PFNA and PFHxS at 10 parts per trillion. Several of the compounds were also regulated as a mixture.

Although the standards applied to only five of the 15,000 types of PFAS, they were something.

“This is the most significant action on PFAS the EPA has ever taken,” Regan said. “The result is a comprehensive and life-changing rule, one that will improve the health and vitality of so many communities across our country.”

Donovan credited the progress to the EPA’s openness to meeting with environmental advocates.

“We had conversations and incredible access to the EPA. We were given the same level of stakeholder value as the industries, maybe even more,” Donovan said. “The Regan we saw at the EPA was much more muscular than at DEQ.”

Not everyone applauded the regulations. Some conservative members of North Carolina’s Environmental Management Commission, which approves or disapproves rules proposed by DEQ, blanched at Regan’s announcement.

Michael Ellison, who was appointed to the commission by Senate President Pro Temp Phil Berger, has a history of downplaying concerns about the compounds. At a meeting that summer, Ellison asked, rhetorically, “For decades we’ve been making and discharging this stuff. How many people have died from PFAS poisoning?”

Sargent was sitting in the room. Her eyes watered. She thought of her brother and the cruelty of Ellison’s remark.

“He had no empathy,” she recalled. “He thought this was a joke.“

The American Water Works Association, a national trade group of public utilities, opposed the standards for financial reasons. The Biden administration had earmarked $2 billion to help utilities cover the costs of advanced treatment to remove the compounds, but that was a fraction of the estimated $30 billion needed for all of the nation’s affected water systems.

In North Carolina, more than 1,900 public water systems would be required to comply with the new rules by 2029. If the maximum contaminant levels had been in effect on the day of Regan’s announcement, the drinking water of at least 300 systems would exceed them.

Two months later, the trade group sued the EPA, arguing the agency hadn’t followed the legally required procedures when it made the rules.

Regan felt assured the standards could withstand a legal challenge. What he wasn’t accounting for was that in seven months Donald Trump would win a second term and that Regan’s successor would begin to brazenly repeal the standards.

May 2025: The Persistent Republican

It was after 7 p.m. on May 7, and the North Carolina House of Representatives had been debating bills for five hours. Davis, wearing a gray suit with a white pocket square and a red tie, rose from Seat No. 9 in the House chamber.

“We’ve had a long day and we’re all tired,” Davis said. “But I hope you’ll give serious consideration to what I have to say.”

Davis was a primary sponsor of a bill titled “PFAS Pollution and Polluter Liability,” modeled after his previous legislation. It was just two pages. Although it didn’t mention Chemours by name, the language was so specific, it could mean no one else.

If a PFAS manufacturer contaminated a public utility’s drinking water above federally permissible levels, it would have to pay for the installation, maintenance and operation of a treatment system to reduce concentrations in finished drinking water to comply with those limits.

“You can make all the PFAS you want,” Davis told his colleagues, “but you can’t release it into the environment.”

A last-minute amendment—key to garnering enough votes for the bill to pass—narrowed the list of eligible public water systems to those that incurred costs of more than $50 million. Those were the systems in New Hanover, Brunswick and Cumberland counties, which, without the bill, would pass the costs on to ratepayers.

“These costs should be the responsibility of the polluter,” Davis said. “It’s only fair.”

Unlike Davis’ previous PFAS legislation, this bill crossed party lines to include many Republicans. It had more than 40 co-sponsors, including some of the most progressive Democrats in the House.

“You can make all the PFAS you want, but you can’t release it into the environment.”

— Rep. Ted Davis Jr.

The members began to vote. On the digital screens mounted in the House chamber, names of those voting yes lit up in green. After 26 seconds, nearly the entire screen was green. The bill passed 104-3.

Davis was ecstatic. It had taken five years for him to carry a Polluter Pays bill this far.

“I was tickled to death,” Davis said later. “That guy from Chemours,” seated in the gallery, “I could see he had a sick look.”

With the House in the win column, Davis now had to convince the Senate to support his legislation.

2025: Sea Foam and an Industry Unrestrained

A few hours before Donovan’s sea foam presentation at Ocean View United Methodist Church, Lee Zeldin, Trump’s EPA administrator, dropped the hammer. He would rescind Regan’s maximum concentration levels for GenX and three other PFAS compounds.

The EPA announcement was even more troubling in light of the results of the long-awaited study on the PFAS-laden sea foam.

Jeffrey Enders, a research assistant professor at NC State University, detected 42 types of PFAS, including some manufactured only by Chemours. One type that Chemours used as a replacement for a phased-out compound, PFO5DoA, was detected at 20,000 parts per trillion. In a different study, scientists had previously found PFO5DoA in 99 percent of the 344 Wilmington residents who provided blood samples.

Levels of PFOS, which has not been produced in the U.S. since 2002, were found in the foam as high as 8 million ppt—the highest concentration ever reported in published scientific journals.

After Enders’ presentation, people told their personal stories.

“I live in Brunswick County and have been exposed my entire life,” one woman said, including while she was pregnant. Her drinking water well had a total PFAS level of 300 ppt.

“Now my kids are having issues,” she said, as she began to cry. “This hits hard.”

June 2025: The Senate Takes Up the Bill

Three weeks later, Davis’ bill was up for discussion in the Senate Environment Committee.

A few Republican members had warmed to regulating Chemours. “We need to run this bill,” said state Sen. Tom McInnis, a Republican whose district includes Cumberland County, another heavily contaminated area. “The folks at Chemours are notorious for not doing what’s right.”

Some Democrats thought the bill didn’t go far enough, although they agreed to support it. “You’re trying to hold the most culpable company responsible,” said Sen. Julie Mayfield of Buncombe County. “I just want people to understand this might not solve the problem.”

“I wish we could get rid of it all, but that would be herculean,” Davis said. “This is a baby step, but it might put a little bit of fear in anyone who might make PFAS.”

The tension in the room tightened. A parade of industry lobbyists began speaking to the committee, including from Chemours.

Jeff Fritz of Chemours said state regulators knew in the early 2000s that DuPont, which later spun part of its business off as Chemours, was making PFAS, including GenX. That is true. However, state records show that while regulators knew about the manufacturing, the companies failed to disclose in their discharge permits that they were sending PFAS into the Cape Fear River.

Fritz also claimed that Chemours voluntarily decided to stop discharging all PFAS. But he omitted the fact that the company did so only under scrutiny by state regulators. And that Chemours failed to stop all discharges until a second state inspection discovered GenX was still entering the river from the plant.

The bill didn’t advance. It’s eligible to be heard again next year.

September 2025: Zeldin Targets GenX Rollback

In September, EPA Administrator Zeldin made good on his promise. The agency filed a motion in the U.S. Court of Appeals in the District of Columbia to vacate Regan’s maximum contamination levels for GenX and the three other PFAS compounds, siding with the American Water Works Association, a trade group that had opposed them.

“This is a flat-out victory for Chemours,” Donovan said. “They’re playing their game, and the Trump EPA is 100 percent caving to industry pressure.”

The argument hinges on what Zeldin alleges is an administrative misstep: When the EPA enacted the rule under Regan, it did so out of sequence.

The Safe Drinking Water Act requires the EPA to first publish a notice of intent to regulate a contaminant and seek public comment on whether it should, in fact, be regulated.

Only then can the agency propose a national primary drinking water standard and goal for the contaminant. That step requires another public comment period.

Zeldin alleges Regan’s EPA proposed and finalized a regulatory determination—as well as the regulation itself—“simultaneously and in tandem.” Without a second comment period, Zeldin argued, the agency “denied the public and the regulated community the opportunity to adequately comment on and participate in the rulemaking process.”

The EPA proposed the PFAS drinking water standards in March 2023 and provided a 60-day comment period, during which over more than 120,000 comments were submitted—including by those now challenging the rule, according to the SELC, which also provided comments.

The agency then published a detailed 4,570-page response to those comments.

Regan’s EPA proposed and finalized the standards simultaneously, instead of moving through each action separately. This, Zeldin argued, “denied the public and the regulated community the opportunity to adequately comment on and participate in the rulemaking process.”

Zeldin’s EPA intends to issue a draft rule rescinding the regulations for public comment this fall; a final rule on the maximum contamination levels (MCLs) is expected next spring.

“This is a motivator, not a deflator. We’re going to continue to fight this, now, more than ever.”

— Emily Donovan, Clean Cape Fear

A Chemours spokesperson said the company supports the EPA’s decision. “Chemours wholly supports setting reasonable and scientifically justified MCLs,” the spokesperson said, “but getting the science right is absolutely critical, and the evidence clearly demonstrates that the previous determination for GenX is flawed.”

Chemours is cherry-picking the facts, trying to “confuse the narrative,” Donovan said.

The EPA retained two independent scientific panels to review its findings. Over 135 pages, the 12 reviewers largely agreed with the conclusions, with minor suggestions; the agency incorporated many of them.

“Chemours is using this as their basis for saying the science is flawed,” she said. “That’s ridiculous.”

The company cited six scientific studies conducted from 2018 to 2023 that concluded GenX’s toxic effects on rodent livers could not be extrapolated to humans because of a genetic difference in how a protein behaves between the two species.

However, four of those studies included a conflict of interest statement from the scientists, many of whom work for private consulting firms, indicating the research had been done on behalf of Chemours.

EPA scientists challenged those Chemours-backed findings. They cited examples of how the protein in question is relevant to both species; in humans, medicines are developed to target that very protein.

More than 40 concerned parties have either petitioned to intervene in the case or to file briefs in support of keeping the standards: Prominent scientists, like Linda Birnbaum, a toxicologist and former director of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences; attorneys general from 17 states, including Jeff Jackson of North Carolina; and environmental groups, including Cape Fear River Watch and Clean Cape Fear.

It’s uncertain whether the rescission will survive a court challenge. Under the federal backsliding rule, the EPA can’t legally repeal the standards, said Jean Zhuang, senior attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center. The Safe Drinking Water Act stipulates that changes to the standards can only be more protective, not less.

“What Zeldin has announced is clearly in violation of the law, in addition to harming over 100 million Americans and their drinking water,” Zhuang said. “These industries, like Chemours, are fighting these drinking water standards because then the pressure is off them to control these chemicals.”

The same day that Zeldin filed the motion in federal court about the GenX standards, DEQ announced it was requiring Chemours to offer private well testing to an additional 14,000 residents in New Hanover, Brunswick, Columbus and Pender counties.

This brings the total to more than 200,000 homes in 10 counties that are eligible for PFAS testing; of those, state records show nearly 7,500 have qualified for alternate water supplies as stipulated in the consent order.

Previous testing has found PFAS 400 feet deep, nearly to bedrock, and in wells as far as 28 miles from Fayetteville Works.

DEQ says it has not yet found the contamination’s edge.",https://www.cityviewnc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AP18201504817526-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-14 10:01:24.363969

Follow Hoffman & Henne’s Inside the Race column every Tuesday at ROI-NJ.com.

JOSHUA: We’re three weeks from Election Day, and Mikie Sherrill’s focusing on driving down costs and making our state more affordability. She’s also making the strong case we can’t afford someone in the Governor’s Office who’ll let Donald Trump make life worse for New Jerseyans.

On the other hand, Jack Ciattarrelli’s closing argument is focused on a). Saying Trump is amazing, b). Mikie maybe, mighta, kinda done something he’s not sure about at the Naval Academy over 40 years ago, and c). Suing Mikie because he didn’t really kill thousands of people…he only made millions of dollars off their opioid abuse, pain and suffering. Do I have that, right, Jeanette?

JEANETTE: Nice try there! Jack’s campaign continues to build momentum from all corners of the state. He was just endorsed by yet another Democrat mayor, North Bergen’s Nick Sacco, and the list keeps growing. I can’t name one Republican who’s endorsed Mikie Sherrill…maybe Tammy Murphy?

At last week’s debate, Mikie looked incredibly defensive regarding her naval academy record – which her story’s changed about several times now. And how she illegally traded stocks while on the House Armed Services Committee in Congress, profiting off of her public service to the tune of $7 million.

Worse, Mikie came completely unhinged, making crazy claims Jack somehow murdered tens of thousands of people through his publishing company, which was sponsored by academic grants of major public universities. This jaw-dropping moment was the most ludicrous thing I’ve ever seen in a debate. Frankly, I couldn’t believe someone of Mikie’s stature, who served in the military and Congress, would make this disgusting and demonstrably false statement. Reporters called it wildly reckless – even for Jersey standards…and that’s saying something.

I know debates get heated, but this is serious. Mikie must be held accountable for her actions, particularly at a time when political violence is so prevalent. It’s no surprise Jack is rightfully bringing forth a defamation lawsuit.

JOSHUA: At the debate, I thought it was bananas for Jack to say he’d give Trump’s second term an “A” grade. His rationale of “I think he’s right about everything that he’s doing” is bonkers. Moreover, as a campaign tactic, it won’t endear him to the independent voters he needs to stand a chance.

But, let’s both get out of the gutter here. Let’s get back to the issue that matters most to the voters…affordability.

JEANETTE: Sounds good!

JOSHUA: By far, Mikie’s best day on the campaign trail was announcing her plan to declare a State of Emergency on utility costs. Sherrill showed voters she understands what’s keeping them up at night and how she’ll take bold steps to make things better. On Day One, she’ll immediately freeze rising energy rates.

JEANETTE: Let’s be clear. You and I both see the bills that come in our mailbox. Every single New Jersey family’s getting crushed by skyrocketing energy prices thanks to Phil Murphy’s disastrous Energy Master Plan.

Jack’s the only candidate with a serious plan to LOWER energy bills. Mikie’s “rate freeze” – which even Governor Murphy says is illegitimate – will lock in the ridiculously high costs we’ve already been paying, not lower them.

JOSHUA: Let’s point fingers in the right place. It’s not sexy – and even people closely following politics/policy don’t totally know what it is – but a lot of fault for utility prices is laid at the feet of PJM. They’re the electric grid’s air-traffic controller. PJM’s board really has no one representing customers. It’s all power plant owners and others looking to profit.

And while we’re pointing fingers, remember it was Chris Christie – not Murphy – who closed some Jersey power plants. Ciattarelli should look at the last Republican governor if looking to cast blame. The same way he should look to Trump, who promised to slash the cost-of-living for Americans – particularly energy prices.

JEANETTE: Once again, New Jersey Democrats want to nationalize this race because they don’t want to talk about their miserable record on this issue.

JOSHUA: Hold your horses, Jeanette…I’d think Jack would want to nationalize this race…You know, he said he’d give Trump an “A” grade and all.

JEANETTE: Funny, Joshua…but you can’t ignore the laws of supply and demand. Democrats are trying to make it a complicated issue, but it’s not. A decade ago, New Jersey was an energy exporter. After eight years of Murphy dumping billions of dollars in off-shore wind, which never came to fruition, and his quixotic quest for “clean” energy by 2035, we now have an energy shortfall and are forced to import our energy (mostly fossil fuels) from other states, at higher prices.

As part of their unrealistic green agenda, the Murphy Administration fought and blocked access to new natural gas pipelines and infrastructure upgrades and completely ignored nuclear, which is a clean, affordable, reliable energy source.

Jack will take New Jersey out of RGGI – which is a waste of hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars and doesn’t make our environment any cleaner. He’ll invest in natural gas, nuclear, and solar, while making sure we have a strong, stable, and reliable energy supply.

JOSHUA: Well, I’m voting for the woman who’ll usher in cleaner, cheaper energy to drive down bills…create good-paying jobs…require more transparency from utility companies. And stand up to Trump.

But, you know what, Jeanette, I think we’re out of time. There’s still so much to go over. Don’t worry, we’ll pick up this energy conversation next week….when I’m sure to be talking about how Trump’s ridiculous war on clean energy is poised to cause New Jersey to lose out on 10,000 jobs over the next 5 years. And how Trump, Ciattarelli and MAGA Republicans support regressive policies just to give massive tax breaks to oil and gas billionaires.

JEANETTE: While I’ll be talking about Jack’s common-sense New Jersey plan to get back to affordable, reliable, and secure energy by increasing our supply.

And I’ll probably still be talking about how Mikie proved she doesn’t have the character, temperament, or judgment to be our next Governor.

Maybe I’ll even let you get the last word next time.",https://images.roi-nj.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Hoffman-Henne-article-image-3.jpeg,N,,2025-10-14 08:01:47.749920

Apple is significantly expanding its clean energy projects across Europe with new large-scale solar and wind farms now in development in Greece, Italy, Latvia, Poland, and Romania. Together with a newly operational solar array in Spain, the projects announced today — all enabled by Apple — will add 650 megawatts of renewable energy capacity to electrical grids across Europe in the coming years, unlocking more than $600 million in financing. This will generate over 1 million megawatt-hours of clean electricity on behalf of Apple users by 2030.

As part of the company’s Apple 2030 goal to be carbon neutral across its entire footprint by the end of this decade, Apple is enabling renewable projects to address the electricity European customers use to power and charge their Apple devices. By 2030, Apple plans to match 100 percent of global customer electricity use with clean electricity by bringing new wind and solar power online around the world. The growing portfolio in Europe marks a significant step toward that goal.

UPDATE

Apple expands renewable energy projects across Europe

New solar and wind projects will add 650 MW of renewable energy capacity to match the electricity European customers use to power Apple products

Apple is significantly expanding its clean energy projects across Europe with new large-scale solar and wind farms now in development in Greece, Italy, Latvia, Poland, and Romania. Together with a newly operational solar array in Spain, the projects announced today — all enabled by Apple — will add 650 megawatts of renewable energy capacity to electrical grids across Europe in the coming years, unlocking more than $600 million in financing. This will generate over 1 million megawatt-hours of clean electricity on behalf of Apple users by 2030.

As part of the company’s Apple 2030 goal to be carbon neutral across its entire footprint by the end of this decade, Apple is enabling renewable projects to address the electricity European customers use to power and charge their Apple devices. By 2030, Apple plans to match 100 percent of global customer electricity use with clean electricity by bringing new wind and solar power online around the world. The growing portfolio in Europe marks a significant step toward that goal.

“By 2030, we want our users to know that all the energy it takes to charge their iPhone or power their Mac is matched with clean electricity,” said Lisa Jackson, Apple’s vice president of Environment, Policy, and Social Initiatives. “Our new projects in Europe will help us achieve our ambitious Apple 2030 goal, while contributing to healthy communities, thriving economies, and secure energy sources across the continent.”

Duke Indiana The Sierra Club awarded Duke a 0% this year, which is the same score it received in the organization’s last report.","Indiana's five major utilities are “backsliding” on their clean energy transitions, according to the Sierra Club's 2025 Dirty Truth Report.

None of the utilities in question — AES Indiana, CenterPoint Energy, Duke Indiana, Indiana Michigan Power (I&M)and The Northern Indiana Public Service Company (NIPSCO) — found themselves with a better score in the report's most recent iteration than in years past.

Scores were awarded on a scale of 1 to 100, largely based on whether utilities are retiring coal plants by 2030, not building new gas plants through 2035, and how the utility’s plan transitioned toward clean energy, also by 2035.

Indiana’s utilities largely did not fare well against these standards.

A spokesperson from Duke Indiana said the utility’s “utmost obligation” is to provide reliable and low-cost energy to customers, which can get tricky when renewable sources, like wind and solar, are weather dependent.

Still, Megan Anderson, a senior organizer with the Sierra Club’s Beyond Coal campaign said she’s worried that utilities are keeping aging coal plants online and building new natural gas plants in response to an upcoming data center boom. If the boom doesn’t happen on the predicted scale or if the centers quickly become more data efficient, she worries that ratepayers will be stuck with the burden of maintenance and repairs for coal plants long past their prime.

Pollution from coal plants remains a major concern for the Sierra Club. Even when utilities meet environmental regulations, which continue to be rolled back, people can still suffer, according to Nicole Chandler, who also works on the Beyond Coal campaign. In her opinion, meeting these regulations should just be the beginning.

“That’s the minimum,” she said. “People are still being harmed by what's happening in these fenceline communities from the pollution.”

When air pollution in the form of health of sulfur dioxide, nitrous oxide, particulate matter and mercury spew from fossil fuel burning power plants, the health of communities living nearby are at risk, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.

The Sierra Club’s report demonstrates that state and federal desires to keep the coal industry afloat is reflected in local utility decision making. But despite President Donald Trump administration’s tirade against renewable energy, Indiana utilities are pursuing an “all of the above” approach to solve the precarious future of Indiana’s energy needs. Coal is staying online, natural gas is being built and renewables are here to stay.

Here's how each utility stacked up in the Sierra Club's report.

AES Indiana

AES tied for Indiana’s highest utility score, with a 57%. The Sierra Club cited AES’s interest in building two new gas burning power plants to serve big customers, like data centers, in their explanation for the score.

Mallory Duncan, a spokesperson for AES, wrote in a statement that the utility has not filed any plans for such plants, adding that future development would comply with state and federal regulations.

She added the utility will also likely be the state’s first investor-owned utility to go coal-free, and it has invested widely in renewable energy like wind and solar. AES is also paving the way forward in Indiana with construction of battery storage systems, which can store energy from wind and solar to be discharged after the sun sets or wind calms.

CenterPoint Energy

CenterPoint Energy’s score took a hit this year, earning a 33%.

The utility is in the middle of writing its next Integrated Resource Plan (IRP), which is a long-term guide map for energy generation, and the drafts show the utility heading in a new direction.

CenterPoint’s last report planned to retire all coal generation by 2023. The Sierra Club noted that now, drafts of the updated IRP show the utility retaining coal past 2030.

Noah Stubbs, a spokesperson for CenterPoint Energy, wrote in an email to IndyStar that the Sierra Club’s report “does not fully reflect the broad set of considerations utilities must weigh today, including rising resource costs, shifting federal incentives and evolving environmental regulations.”

He added that 70% of the company’s coal fleet has been retired or exited since the Integrated Resource Plan. CenterPoint also has plans for 1.1 GW of new generation by 2026, over half of which Stubbs said will be sourced from renewable energy projects.

Duke Indiana

The Sierra Club awarded Duke a 0% this year, which is the same score it received in the organization’s last report.

Duke was initially planning to close its Gibson County coal plant in 2035, but the utility extended its life by three years, much to the ire of clean energy advocates, according to reporting from WFYI. Duke also proposed new natural gas plants, like in Vermillion County, Indiana, and the Sierra Club noted the utility has ditched plans to build out renewable energy. Almost 3,798 megawatts of renewable energy investments that were cut dropped from its long-term energy plan, according to the report.

Angeline Protogere, a spokesperson for Duke, wrote in an email to IndyStar that MISO, the agency running the energy market across most of Indiana, lowered the values assigned to renewable generation, which was an “important driver” in how they planned energy generation.

“We have to demonstrate that we have enough generation to serve our customers’ needs in every season,” said Protogere.

I&M

I&Mslid from a 66% last year to a 48% in 2025. The Sierra Club cited costs from coal plants being shifted solely onto Indiana customers.

Stephanie Smith, a spokesperson from I&M, stressed that the utility’s energy mix is designed to provide safe, reliable and clean power customers can count on around the clock in a statement. This mix includes fossil fuels like coal, natural gas, but also emission-free energy generation from nuclear, wind, solar and battery storage.

NIPSCO

After receiving an 80% last year, NIPSCO earned a 57% in 2025, tying with AES for top marks.

As for the drop, the Sierra Club cited NIPSCO’s plans for new gas plant. Jessica Cantarelli, a spokesperson for NIPSCO, explained that while the utility committed to protecting human health and the environment, NIPSCO has to ensure reliability — a common theme across the Indiana utilities struggling to balance clean energy and dependability.

Industrial development is on pace to double global electricity demand by 2050, according to McKinsey & Company's Global Energy Perspective 2025 report. The race to build artificial intelligence data centers is a key driver of that demand in Western Europe, China, and North America.

""After analyzing a detailed pipeline of data center projects, we predict an average global growth rate of 17% per year in data-center-related power demand between 2022 and 2030,"" the report states.

Big Tech companies are building massive new data center campuses across the country and are continuing to announce new projects. Utilities are projecting 60 gigawatts — enough electricity to power six cities — of new power demand will come from data centers alone through the end of the decade.

From Virginia to Louisiana and Arizona, the major public utilities are seeking regulatory approval to build new power plants and transmission lines. These projects often run into the billions of dollars, and have raised questions over how much of the costs should be passed on to residential and small business ratepayers.

Partisan rancor endures after Republicans enacted their tax law using maneuvers to sidestep Democrats, and the White House rescinded already appropriated federal funds.
The House last year passed a $78 billion bipartisan business and child tax break bill and a year later voted to create treaty-like tax benefits to firms operating in Taiwan.
Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) hopes to include her bill extending that break in any tax package that materializes this year, according to a spokesperson.
But he said hasn’t talked with his Republican colleagues about a broader package as the House remains in recess amid the shutdown.","Race tracks, film studios, and other businesses are in line to face higher taxes next year if lawmakers are unable to bridge the partisan rift widening on Capitol Hill.

The nearly two-week old shutdown that’s led to furloughs of thousands of federal workers hinges in part over looming expiration of an enhanced premium tax credit for health plans purchased on exchanges created by the Obama-era health care law.

But other bipartisan tax credits are also expiring. Their backers hope a year-end deal averts those cliffs but acknowledge the dearth of trust between the parties amid the shutdown bodes poorly.

“I’ll work with anybody on legislation that’s good for the American people and my district,” said Rep. Mike Thompson (D-Calif.), the ranking member on the Ways and Means Committee’s tax subcommittee who co-sponsored a permanent extension of the race car break. “But this does kind of sour the soup.”

Extenders Left Behind

Congress has perennially passed what’s known as an extenders package, renewing mostly bipartisan expired and expiring tax breaks. Many of these, such as the expired credit for American Samoan tuna canneries, were left out of Republicans’ July mega law, leaving their fate to the whims of lawmakers considering a raft of issues in bipartisan legislation before the calendar turns.

Partisan rancor endures after Republicans enacted their tax law using maneuvers to sidestep Democrats, and the White House rescinded already appropriated federal funds.

Popular support for each extender break individually may be insufficient to overcome that strife, said Ray Beeman, who leads EY’s Washington Council practice.

Because lawmakers’ terms aren’t expiring this year, they may feel that waiting until 2026 and extending the breaks retroactively is more attractive, Beeman said. The funding lapse has also fractured the attention of lawmakers and their staff, dimming the prospects of planning a package.

“At least, while there’s a shutdown, I just don’t think anybody’s super focused on” other extenders, Beeman said.

There’s been little, if any, substantial negotiation over a year-end package.

Rep. Richard Neal (D-Mass.), the ranking member of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee, told reporters his discussions with Committee Chair Jason Smith (R-Mo.) about such a deal have been minimal.

Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), the ranking member of the tax-writing Senate Finance Committee, said he “will work with anybody to try to find common ground.” But he dinged the panel’s chair, Sen. Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) for skipping a committee debate and vote on Republicans’ tax law despite his calls for “regular order.”

Spokespeople for Smith and Crapo did not return requests for comment.

The House last year passed a $78 billion bipartisan business and child tax break bill and a year later voted to create treaty-like tax benefits to firms operating in Taiwan. That’s giving some lawmakers reason to think an extenders deal is possible.

“We’ve shown that even in a pretty hyperpartisan environment, we were able to come together,” said Rep. Lloyd Smucker (R-Pa.), a senior member of the Ways and Means and Budget committees.

Employer, Film Studio Tax Breaks

One extender at stake is the Work Opportunity Tax Credit, which benefits employers who hire veterans, felons, the disabled and other disadvantaged groups. Smucker is pushing for an expansion of that bonus, arguing it ends up saving money as workers contribute to the Treasury.

The ability of film and TV studios, theaters, and sound recording studios to quickly write off their expenses also faces expiration. Lobbyists for the entertainment industry have sought to extend a long-standing benefit that allows such productions to immediately take advantage of depreciation rules that would normally have to wait for their work to premiere to claim.

Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) hopes to include her bill extending that break in any tax package that materializes this year, according to a spokesperson. Sen. Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.), who has co-sponsored her bill, also wants to get it across the finish line.

“I disagree with her on almost everything, but here we finding a way to sing from the same song sheet,” he said.

Tax writers representing motorsports speedways are also hoping to preserve the tax treatment of race tracks used by operators big and small, including NASCAR.

“If any bill has a tax title, you see if you can insert it into the larger package,” said Sen. Todd Young (R-Ind.), who represents the home of the Indy 500. “I’m imagining it’ll be a year-end play.”

Speedway operations don’t qualify for the taxpayer subsidies that other major league sports often get, and the industry is hoping they can avoid an expiration or at least apply the break retroactively next year so they stay on a level playing field with amusement parks and golf courses.

“The only thing that makes me feel good is that we’ve been in these positions before,” said Dean Aguillen, a principal at OGR who lobbies for the Automobile Competition Committee for the United States, the trade association for the motorsports industry.

Thompson, who has co-sponsored the House companion to Young’s motorsports bill, too hopes it can be included in a year-end package.

But he said hasn’t talked with his Republican colleagues about a broader package as the House remains in recess amid the shutdown.

“I just walked the halls this morning, can’t find a single one,” Thompson said.",https://db0ip7zd23b50.cloudfront.net/dims4/default/6f9b989/2147483647/strip/false/crop/3994x1539+3+356/resize/960x370!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbloomberg-bna-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ffa%2F25%2Fef1344864aa4b11e5ffa7d366415%2F430123371.jpg,N,,2025-10-14 12:12:05.181042

The client for both projects is Ecopetrol, Colombia’s state-owned oil company, which holds significant influence in the local energy sector.

Deepening the Latin American Market, Fulfilling a Green Mission

As the fourth-largest economy in Latin America, the Colombian government places high importance on its energy transition and has identified solar power as a key development focus. According to the national plan, Colombia aims to achieve a 6 GW solar PV installation target within the next three years and strives to increase the share of renewable energy to 30% by 2030. Driven by both policy guidance and investment support, Colombia’s PV market is experiencing rapid growth.

Against this backdrop, Clenergy’s PV mounting solutions have facilitated the implementation of the 23 MW La Fiercal and the 1.8 MW Providencia Island ground-mounted PV projects in Colombia. These projects are of great significance for optimizing Colombia’s energy structure, reducing dependence on fossil fuels, and promoting green, low-carbon development.

Customized Solutions Empowering Complex Scenarios

Clenergy consistently adheres to a dual-drive development strategy of “localized service + technological innovation.” While expanding its overseas markets, the company conducts in-depth research into the geographical features, climatic conditions, and actual customer needs of target regions. Focusing on technological innovation, Clenergy continuously iterates and upgrades its solutions, committed to providing highly adaptable PV mounting solutions.

Addressing the environmental challenges in parts of Colombia, such as complex terrain, high temperature and humidity in coastal areas, and high corrosion risks, both projects utilized Clenergy’s versatile SolarTerrace MAC ground-mounted PV mounting solutions and products.

This product utilizes new ZAM (Zn-Al-Mg) steel, which offers excellent corrosion resistance, enabling stable performance even in extreme environments characterized by high heat, humidity, and sandstorms. The system features a flexible and adaptable installation structure, suitable for regions with different wind load requirements. Its easy installation saves time and labor costs, opening new avenues for reducing costs and increasing efficiency in ground-mounted power plants.

La Fiercal 23 MW Ground-Mounted PV Project

As the first PV project within a refinery complex in Latin America, the La Fiercal project holds landmark significance. Upon operation, the project will supply 34.29 GWh of clean energy annually to the Cartagena Refinery, injecting green power into industrial operations.

Providencia Island 1.8 MW Ground-Mounted PV Project

Providencia Island was severely damaged by a hurricane, leading to extensive infrastructure destruction. To accelerate post-disaster reconstruction and improve the local energy supply situation, the Colombian government initiated the PV project on the island. The island faces not only the threat of hurricanes but also, due to its coastal location, a permanently high-corrosion C5-class environment.

Confronting this dual challenge, Clenergy selected high-corrosion-resistant ZAM material for the mounting structures and enhanced their stability and durability under extreme hurricane conditions through optimized structural design. The completion and operation of the project effectively optimize the island’s energy structure, significantly improve power supply reliability, and provide a clean electricity guarantee for local reconstruction and sustainable development.

Looking ahead, Clenergy remains committed to technological innovation and service upgrades, collaborating with global partners to jointly promote the high-quality development of the global PV industry and contribute technological strength to the worldwide energy transition and sustainable development.",https://www.solarbeglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/4-2.jpg,N,,2025-10-14 10:01:10.652469

Environmental justice advocates, Garcia said, may have to talk differently and be increasingly careful with language.
Terms like “environmental justice” and “climate change,” have become so politicized that they can stop conversations even before they begin.
Environmental justice addressed those same concerns, she said, with a focus on those most impacted, namely low-income communities and people of color.
In 2022, a national program, the Office of Environmental Justice and External Civil Rights was born.","As a child, Lisa Garcia spent her summers in a South Bronx where playgrounds had more cracked pavement and asphalt than grass. She biked or hung out on stoops with her friends. She considered herself outdoorsy, even if the outdoors looked a little different in the working class neighborhood of Soundview.

“Literally no one I grew up with knew that there was actually a Bronx River,” Garcia said. “When we were growing up, the Bronx River was a parkland.”

The 24-mile waterway—New York City’s only freshwater stream—runs beneath the Bruckner Expressway and Sheridan Boulevard and parallel to the Bronx Parkway. Back then, few children knew it was there. Fewer went near it. Green spaces were squeezed in pockets between concrete. Garcia, who was asthmatic, remembers the air as acrid with exhaust that triggered some painful coughing fits.

Only much much later did she learn that there likely was a connection between her health and her Bronx surroundings.

Garcia, 58, has spent nearly three decades fighting for environmental justice in the courts and through laws and regulations that ensure the right to live in safe, healthy environments with equal protections. At the Environmental Protection Agency, she served in the Biden administration as administrator for Region 2, covering New Jersey, New York, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and eight Native Nations.

Before that, she served as associate administrator and senior advisor to EPA Administrators Lisa P. Jackson and Gina McCarthy during the Obama administration and focused on environmental justice planning, helping build widely available online maps that showed, block by block, where pollution and people overlap.

Now environmental justice is under attack. President Trump’s administration has taken a torch to the EPA website, eradicating what Garcia, among others, built to encourage more investigation and public participation in environmental protections. Garcia, too, was part of the upheaval: she was among the political appointees in the Biden Administration who resigned in January after the November election.

“When you take the job as a political appointee, you know in four years you may be out of a job,” Garcia said. Still, the last few months of the Trump era have been disorienting. “What I did not foresee is the complete dismantling of the work and the disrespect for the workers.”

It might be time for the fight for environmental justice to take a different approach—or adopt different ways to get more communities on board, she said.

How to do that keeps her up at night, Garcia said. How can activists hope to incorporate environmental justice into government entities now? What practices make the most sense, what lessons were learned, and, how can she offer new ways to help people compile evidence and facts? People still live in polluted, unhealthy neighborhoods. People are still getting sick. People still need to know that there are laws and regulations that should be protecting them, she said.

Environmental justice advocates, Garcia said, may have to talk differently and be increasingly careful with language. Terms like “environmental justice” and “climate change,” have become so politicized that they can stop conversations even before they begin.

Keeping the conversations on shared health risks and benefits may be the answer. “It’s not over,” Garcia said over a cup of coffee in Union Square, laying out the need for remediation for industrial pollution still troubling many low-income neighborhoods.

Garcia said she first considered environmental justice when she was a student in Spain, attending law school in 1999. Garcia, an avid international traveler and fluent in Spanish, was initially drawn to human rights, but an environmental law class changed that. Human rights and environmental law became inseparable in her mind.

Not long after, Garcia began to think back to her childhood asthma and the exhaust that drifted through Soundview. It was her “ah-ha,” moment. Since then, Garcia’s career has shifted between government and nonprofit work. She said she is most satisfied “in the trenches” with people, including five years working for EarthJustice, the public interest law organization.

“Environmental justice” crystallized as a concept in the late 1980s, and the movement gained national attention when residents in Warren County, North Carolina, protested a proposed landfill that would be designated as a dump for products laden with polychlorinated biphenyl. PCB is a manmade chemical used in fire retardants and some adhesives and plastics that is banned in many countries as a toxin.

Republican President Richard Nixon had created the EPA years earlier, in part from public demand–and legal challenges—to regulate pollution in the air and in waterways. Environmental justice addressed those same concerns, she said, with a focus on those most impacted, namely low-income communities and people of color.

The rationale was simple and rooted in equity. “Why not have everyone have parks, clean air and clean water to swim in?” she said.

There were decades of progress under both Republican and Democrat administrations. Garcia helped create “Plan EJ 2014,” under President Barack Obama, which was the first strategic plan for weaving environmental justice throughout EPA funding and projects.

She worked with colleagues to embed environmental justice criteria in launching EJSCREEN publicly in 2015, so that anyone could type in a ZIP code to add to the growing sets of data. But in January, in the first week of the second Trump presidency, all bets were off. The EJSCREEN tool is gone now. That part of the website doesn’t exist.

“There’s a certain pride that we must have been doing something right when we created EJSCREEN if the Trump administration feels like you can’t even have access to it,” Garcia said, smiling. Experts had the foresight to take screenshots before the site went dark. “A lot of it is preserved. It’ll be static, but at least it’s not lost completely.”

Trump’s administration has gutted most broad protections and, within weeks, revoked any prior executive orders involving environmental justice. When Trump signed executive order 14151, “Ending Radical and Wasteful Government DEI Programs and Preferencing,” EPA funding was no longer assured for existing programs. The next month, he cancelled pivotal environmental and climate block grants worth $3 billion.

Garcia said these actions shouldn’t have been so easy to do. And the administration’s decision to fire EPA staff and cut federal funding for programs, she said, is a step backward. A clean and healthy environment is a goal that should not be controversial, she said.

Garcia said Trump, in his first presidency, did not target the EPA so aggressively, and many safeguards and programs survived. But the Biden administration took a different approach from an Obama-era EPA, she said, by creating a separate office to prioritize environmental justice. In 2022, a national program, the Office of Environmental Justice and External Civil Rights was born.

For the first time, there was a lot of money and over 200 people at the EPA dedicated to the movement. That too now is gone. The Trump administration was “able to destroy it,” she said.

Still, post-EPA, Garcia continues to pivot through the challenges. Today she continues her work through lecturing at both Columbia University and New York University, on environmental law. She’s also working on a project to improve New York State’s watershed program, and still attends hearings held by the former White House Environmental Justice Environment Committee.

She doesn’t plan on stopping her work any time soon, despite all the pivoting. The federal government has stepped away, but grassroots environmental justice leaders are still on the ground across the country and able to make change, Garcia said. She only has to look around her old neighborhood to know that there is strength in numbers.

In the Bronx, the once-ignored river of her childhood now is supported by the Bronx River Alliance, which publishes newsletters and sponsors events for residents to learn more about its vast natural resource.

The river once known as the “open sewer” choked with car parts and garbage is now home to herring, oysters, blue crabs, and beavers populations. People come out and kayak near the restored wetlands on sunny days.

“We’ve been doing this for over 40 years,” Garcia said. “We’ll continue to do it.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/LisaGarcia-1024x692.jpg,N,,2025-10-14 08:02:33.070003

In 2013, the Environmental Protection Agency recommended stricter limits after new research showed mussels, snails and other aquatic life are more sensitive to ammonia than previously understood.

""EPA included additional species in its calculations, and the new recommendations are stricter than what's in our current regulations,"" said Mike Kruse, environmental program manager for the Missouri Department of Natural Resources' Watershed Protection Section. ""We're proposing to adopt those standards to better protect aquatic life in Missouri streams and lakes.""

Unlike a single fixed number, ammonia criteria typically use formulas that vary depending on factors such as pH, or water temperature. Missouri regulators plan to calculate limits by using region-specific standards.

Kruse said the impact will be felt most by small rural communities that rely on lagoon systems, which were not designed to treat ammonia at the stricter levels. ""Upgrading them would mean essentially rebuilding the treatment plant,"" he said. ""For small communities with shrinking populations, that's a pretty significant cost.""

To ease the transition, the state is offering variances — temporary exceptions that let facilities show the highest level of treatment they can realistically achieve and request more time to comply with the new federal standards. Larger city plants must also meet the new requirements, but their infrastructure is better-equipped to handle the changes without major upgrades, Kruse said.

The DNRC held an open house this week to guide community representatives through the variance application process. Additional sessions are planned in the coming months.

The Philippines’ leading cold-storage operator, Mets, has partnered with First Gen Corp., the country’s largest geothermal energy supplier, to power the energy-intensive sector with renewable energy, seeking both cost savings and lower emissions.

Cold storage expansion meets energy transition goals

Under the agreement signed on Oct. 3, Mets will source up to 2.05 MW of electricity from the Mount Apo Geothermal Power Plant, operated by Energy Development Corp. (EDC), a subsidiary of First Gen Corp. The renewable supply will cover the company’s current power needs and support its planned expansion.

The facility, with a storage capacity of over 7,100 metric tons, is part of Mets’ growing nationwide cold-chain network.

“This partnership with First Gen allows us to ensure a stable power supply for our cold-storage facilities while supporting our goal of using clean, renewable energy,” said Donna Robles, Mets’ Chief Operating Officer.

A key player in the Philippines’ cold-storage and logistics market, Mets offers temperature-controlled warehousing, blast freezing, and toll-processing services, providing more than 100,000 pallet positions across its network. The company secured a USD 120 million investment last year to fund its expansion plans.

The country’s cold-chain industry is projected to grow to USD 1.5 billion by 2026 and reach USD 1.7 billion by 2027, fueled by rising demand from the food, pharmaceutical, and logistics sectors. As energy costs climb, operators are increasingly turning to renewable sources to cut expenses and strengthen sustainability credentials.

Geothermal capacity scales up in the Philippines and the region

“Clean and reliable power is vital for cold-storage operations that keep food and medicine safe,” said Arlene Sy-Soriano, Assistant Vice President at First Gen Corp. “This collaboration with Mets Cold Storage underscores how geothermal energy can enhance both sustainability and reliability in the cold-chain sector.”

The partnership also reflects First Gen’s broader strategy to expand its geothermal leadership both domestically and overseas. The company operates 13 integrated geothermal power plants with a total capacity of 1,200 MW, along with hydro, solar, and wind assets with a combined capacity of more than 400 MW.

To accelerate the energy transition, First Gen plans to invest around USD 20 billion over the next five years to expand its power portfolio to 13 GW, both in the Philippines and overseas. Its regional ambitions are underscored by a USD 2 billion joint geothermal project in Indonesia, which aims to build six power plants with a total capacity of 440 MW.

The Philippines ranks as the world’s third-largest geothermal power producer, behind the U.S. and Indonesia, with an installed capacity of approximately 1.9 GW, accounting for 14.6% of the national electricity mix.

The experience of other countries suggests that after the cancellation of benefits, the electric vehicle market may go through a period of stagnation before resuming growth thanks to technological improvements and cost reduction.","Impact of Government Incentives on the Market

Despite talks about market forces, it was government incentives that played a key role in popularizing electric vehicles. This is particularly noticeable towards the end of September, when federal tax credits officially expired. According to research firm Rho Motion, up to 90% of all battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids sold in the US received some form of tax benefit during the first nine months of the year.

Sales Surge Before the Deadline

The expiration of the federal electric vehicle tax credit on October 1st provoked a national rush for relevant models. This led to record sales for a number of brands and increased overall demand for electric cars in August and September. This year, the Environmental Protection Agency determined that 20 battery electric vehicles and one plug-in hybrid model met the criteria for the new clean vehicle credit worth up to $7,500. Together, these cars accounted for 55% of all electric car sales from January to September.

Leasing Loopholes and Fleet Support

A less known Commercial Clean Vehicle Credit, also worth up to $7,500, played an important role in supporting sales. This credit was available for vehicles weighing up to 14,000 pounds and was intended for fleets and business buyers. It also allowed automakers to claim the tax credit themselves and reduce the cost of leasing new models. Importantly, leased passenger cars were not subject to the same origin and assembly requirements as purchased ones, and they did not need to be produced in North America, making leasing a particularly attractive option.

Results Before Benefits Expired

As the September 30th credit expiration date approached, electric vehicle sales surged sharply across the United States. Ford sold 30,612 battery electric vehicles in the third quarter, which is 86% more than in the second quarter. GM’s electric car sales increased by 44% to 66,501 units, Tesla reported a 27% sales increase, and Hyundai also noted significant growth thanks to doubled demand for the Ioniq 5.

Prospects Without Incentives

It remains unclear how sharply electric vehicle sales will decline in the fourth quarter after tax credits expire. Rho Motion expects demand to “sharply decrease.” The research firm also points out that tariffs, high costs of local production, and weakened fuel efficiency standards will likely restrain investments in domestic electric vehicle production, creating additional pressure on demand in the coming months.

The expiration of tax benefits may become a test for automakers, who now must adapt to market conditions without significant government support. Some companies have already announced their own sales incentive programs, but their effectiveness remains questionable. The experience of other countries suggests that after the cancellation of benefits, the electric vehicle market may go through a period of stagnation before resuming growth thanks to technological improvements and cost reduction.",https://topgir.com.ua/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/kia-2026_ev4-copy-1024x576-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-14 09:01:25.176354

Let’s fix permitting, unleash American energy and secure a stronger future for every state.","Energy is the backbone of our economy and our way of life. From powering homes to fueling businesses, reliable and affordable energy keeps America moving forward. But today, outdated permitting rules are blocking the very projects we need to secure our future. Regulations that were designed to provide a fair process have turned into roadblocks. Instead of delivering better outcomes, they now drive up costs, stall job creation and leave families footing the bill.

On average, major energy projects take more than six years to secure approval. Some transmission lines have been delayed as long as seventeen years. During that time, demand keeps rising, infrastructure keeps aging and costs keep climbing. Transmission congestion alone costs American families $11.5 billion in 2023. Those costs show up in monthly utility bills and in lost opportunities for new jobs and investment.

Every state feels these challenges. In the Southeast, families have watched their power bills surge nearly 24% for households and 19% across all sectors in just the past decade. Families and businesses are paying more, while projects that could deliver cleaner, cheaper power are stuck in line. The result is a system where energy consumers pay the price of government inaction.

Permitting delays no longer make projects safer or cleaner. They simply make them more expensive and less certain. Developers spend years navigating duplicative reviews and endless litigation, often without a clear end in sight. This uncertainty discourages investment, slows innovation and means fewer new projects break ground. At the same time, consumers lose out on the lower costs and greater reliability that come when competition and new supply are allowed to flourish. Dominion Energy projects a $14 to $37 monthly increase in customer bills by 2040 due to rising generation and transmission costs. (Disclosure: Dominion is one of our donors, but donors have no say in news decisions; see our policy).

The stakes are only getting higher as energy demand is growing rapidly. In Virginia, peak load is expected to rise between 0.3% to 5.7% annually, driven by expanding industries like data centers, advanced manufacturing and electric vehicles that are adding new load to an already strained grid. Without timely upgrades to transmission and generation, costs will rise, reliability will suffer and our ability to compete globally will weaken. We can’t afford to let red tape hold us back.

That’s why permitting reform is essential. A smarter, more predictable system would:

Set clear timelines so reviews can’t drag on for years without resolution.

Reduce duplication by designating a single lead agency to oversee major projects.

Focus reviews on major projects while letting routine, low-impact ones move quickly.

Prevent endless lawsuits by establishing fair but limited opportunities for judicial review.

These reforms won’t weaken environmental protections. They’ll simply make the process work. Americans deserve both strong environmental stewardship and an energy system that is affordable, reliable and secure. With clearer rules and faster decisions, we can have both.

Permitting reform is about more than paperwork. It’s about lowering costs for families. It’s about creating jobs through new projects and infrastructure. And it’s about strengthening America’s energy independence so we’re never at the mercy of foreign supply chains or aging infrastructure.

We’ve always been a nation that builds. From railroads to highways to pipelines, our infrastructure has powered our growth and secured our future. But today, the greatest obstacle to building isn’t technology or resources, it’s bureaucracy. Red tape is holding America back at the exact moment when we need to unleash our full energy potential.

By cutting through the gridlock and modernizing our permitting system, Congress can deliver real results: affordable electricity, reliable power, secure supply and new jobs. Families want it, businesses need it and our future depends on it.

Permitting reform is not just a policy debate; it’s a national necessity. The time to act is now. Let’s fix permitting, unleash American energy and secure a stronger future for every state.

Backed by its parent group, Vingroup, one of Southeast Asia's largest private enterprises, VinFast is not simply focused on car production. Instead, the company is taking a long-term, systemic approach to green mobility, building what it calls a fully integrated industrial ecosystem, one that connects materials, energy, mobility, and digital services under a single, sustainable framework.

Green Steel: The Strategic Backbone of Self-Reliance

The latest step to solidify that ecosystem is VinMetal, a new high-tech steel manufacturer announced recently. With an initial annual capacity of five million tons, VinMetal is designed to produce green steel that will directly supply VinFast's electric vehicle assembly lines.

At first glance, a steel plant may not sound revolutionary. But for Vingroup, it is a strategic move to strengthen the backbone of its industrial operations. Green steel production will not only reduce dependency on global supply chains but also lower carbon emissions, two critical challenges facing EV manufacturers worldwide.

Nguyễn Việt Quang, Vice Chairman and CEO of Vingroup and concurrently CEO of VinMetal, stated: ""VinMetal is not just a steel plant. It represents a strategic preparation for a modern, green, and sustainable infrastructure future for Vietnam. At Vingroup, we believe that proactively developing foundational industries will help our country enter a new growth era, where Vietnamese people master technology, materials, and the execution of national-scale projects.""

The pursuit of vertical integration, from the foundational steel to the sophisticated software, marks a distinct departure from the lean manufacturing model favored by most established automakers and even many emerging competitors.

Of course, this also speaks to something greater, VinFast is backed by the comprehensive and steadfast support of Vingroup, a corporation defined by its bold vision and mission.

For VinFast, controlling the supply chain means controlling quality, cost, and ultimately, the pace of innovation. This bold strategy for production self-sufficiency is not an academic exercise. It is the direct prerequisite for the automaker to confidently launch its products into challenging international markets, especially the United States, where quality resilience and cost transparency are non-negotiable.

VinFast's Strategy for the U.S. Market

In the United States, VinFast's lineup centers around two key SUV models: the elegantly designed VF 8 and the spacious, three-row VF 9. Both are engineered to meet the evolving needs of modern American consumers, where a blend of practicality, advanced technology, and a focus on safety is paramount.

The VF 8, a five-passenger mid-size SUV, is positioned as a versatile vehicle for daily commutes and weekend getaways. Meanwhile, the VF 9 tackles the demands of larger families or long-distance travelers, focusing on generous space and premium comfort features to make electric driving effortless and enjoyable.

VinFast's strategy for the U.S. market is built around a clear mission: to make premium electric mobility more accessible. The company is attempting to erode the traditional barrier of high upfront costs by offering inclusive pricing, flexible financing, and attractive lease programs.

For example, VF 8 lease programs start as low as $279 per month under certain promotional offers, with qualified customers potentially enjoying 0% APR financing options.

Crucially, VinFast's commitment to quality is underscored by its warranty policy: 10 years or 125,000 miles for the vehicle, and an industry-leading 10-year unlimited-mileage warranty for the battery. Amid market anxiety over battery durability, this commitment sends a strong, confident message about the company's engineering quality.

Digital Connection and Confidence on Every Journey

Understanding that range anxiety remains a key consideration for many first-time EV owners, VinFast has prioritized convenience and connectivity. VinFast vehicles are fully compatible with America's rapidly growing public charging infrastructure.

Through the VinFast app, owners can easily locate nearby chargers, monitor charging progress, and plan efficient routes, all from their smartphones. This seamless digital experience reflects the company's broader philosophy: ensuring that the transition to sustainable mobility is as effortless and reassuring as possible.

Moreover, recognizing the effectiveness of its dealer-based sales strategy, VinFast has accelerated the expansion of its dealership network across the United States. Each partner is carefully selected for proven capability, industry experience, strong reputation, and deep local insight. This approach enables VinFast to deliver high-quality products and exceptional service to a broader customer base, while ensuring sustainable, well-optimized growth and strengthening the brand's presence nationwide.

Instead of a V10 monster, we got something totally different, and arguably even more important. Meet the Toyota Corolla Concept, teased ahead of its full debut at the Japan Mobility Show on October 29.

At first glance, this thing doesn’t scream “concept.” It looks way too production-ready with actual, albeit razor-thin side mirrors, realistic proportions, and that signature Toyota restraint under all the bold new lines. But look a little closer, and there’s something really interesting going on.

The Electric Gospel According to Toyota

See that fuel cap on the front fender? That’s not where you’d expect it on a gas-powered car. That’s usually a sign of a charging port, meaning this could be the first-ever all-electric Corolla. It’s technically possible it’s a plug-in hybrid, but Toyota already has the Prius handling that job. So this might be the clean-sheet EV version everyone’s been waiting for, or possibly even make it available for markets where the Prius is absent.

Still, knowing Toyota, they’re not about to abandon combustion engines anytime soon. The Corolla is the best-selling nameplate in history, and Toyota has made it clear they think EVs aren’t the one-size-fits-all solution, continuing to spread their version of the Hybrid EV gospel. So, expect both an EV and an ICE version sharing this new look, one platform, two powertrains.

Toyota Finally Having Fun?

Design-wise, this is easily the boldest Corolla we’ve ever seen. The pixel-style DRLs, sloping roofline, and that ducktail spoiler give it a futuristic but familiar feel. The short hood could mean it’s riding on a dedicated EV platform. Toyota’s also been teasing a new ultra-compact four-cylinder engine, so who knows. What’s clear is that this marks a new era for the Corolla. One that finally steps out of the “safe and sensible” shadow and into something that looks genuinely exciting.

We’ll know more once Toyota officially reveals it on October 29, along with the other peculiar creations from the Japanese automaker, but if this concept is even half as close to production as it looks, the Corolla nameplate might be headed for its biggest transformation yet.",https://media.zenfs.com/en/autoblog_arena_articles_145/bcc5dea290a15053cf37aade7222cef8,N,,2025-10-14 09:05:09.194339

The Trump administration’s decision to let the program lapse is part of its broader rollback of clean-energy subsidies. Industry leaders warn the shift could slow adoption and weaken U.S. competitiveness in the global EV market.

GM drops lease workaround

General Motors confirmed on October 8 that it abandoned a plan to capture remaining tax credits through dealer leases after criticism from lawmakers and legal experts. The company’s finance arm had planned to buy EVs from dealer inventory before the deadline, claim the credits, and pass savings on to customers.

GM now says it will fund lease incentives internally through October. Ford has not disclosed if it will pursue a similar approach.

Tesla raises lease prices and trims costs

Following the loss of the tax credit, Tesla raised U.S. lease rates for all models. Monthly payments for the Model Y now range from $529 to $599, and the Model 3 from $429 to $759, according to Reuters.

To maintain affordability, Tesla launched new “Standard” versions of both vehicles with fewer features and shorter range. Analysts say the move shows how deeply the tax credit had shaped EV pricing.

Honda halts Acura EV as demand weakens

Honda Motor Co. has discontinued its Acura ZDX electric crossover, built at GM’s Spring Hill, Tennessee plant. The company cited low demand and plans to shift to its in-house RSX EV platform by 2026.

Meanwhile, the U.S. Department of Energy is reviewing more than $1.1 billion in grants previously awarded to GMand Stellantis for EV production. If rescinded, the funding cuts could delay major plant expansions.

States continue to push forward

While federal support ends, several states are expanding their own incentive programs. California, New York, and Connecticut continue to promote EV adoption. Connecticut recently raised its CHEAPR rebate to as much as $4,000 for new battery EVs.

Globally, China’s BYD and Europe’s Volkswagen Group are increasing output with strong policy backing, further pressuring U.S. automakers.

The road ahead

Analysts expect EV sales in the U.S. to decline in 2026 before stabilizing later in the decade. Automakers are turning to hybrids and plug-in hybrids to balance costs and consumer demand.

Beyond GE Vernova, a broad spectrum of industrial companies are poised for continued success.
This strategic imperative is likely to sustain political and financial backing for the Industrials sector, embedding its growth drivers deeply into national policy.
These factors are not merely transient market fluctuations but represent deep-seated structural shifts that promise sustained growth for the sector.
Moving forward, the Industrials sector is poised for continued resilience and growth, making it a compelling area for investors seeking exposure to long-term economic transformation.","New York, NY – October 13, 2025 – The S&P 500 Industrials sector has closed today's trading session with a remarkable surge, cementing its position as a leading performer in the broader market. This significant positive momentum is largely attributed to a confluence of robust economic drivers, including ambitious reshoring initiatives, unprecedented infrastructure spending, and the accelerating global energy transition. At the forefront of this industrial resurgence is GE Vernova (NYSE: GEV), whose stock performance has topped the market, signaling strong investor confidence in companies poised to capitalize on these transformative trends.

The sector's impressive showing today underscores a deeper narrative of industrial revitalization in the United States. With a year-to-date gain of 14.5% for the S&P 500 Industrials sector, and an even more striking 26.75% for an equal-weighted index by late September 2025, the market is clearly signaling a bullish outlook. Investors are increasingly drawn to the sector's resilience and its direct ties to strategic national priorities, making its sustained growth a compelling story for both retail and institutional portfolios.

Unpacking the Industrial Surge: A Confluence of Catalysts

The strong performance of the Industrials sector is not an isolated event but rather the culmination of several powerful economic and policy tailwinds. A primary driver is the pervasive trend of reshoring and onshoring initiatives, as companies seek to mitigate geopolitical risks and enhance supply chain resilience by bringing manufacturing back to domestic soil. Government policies such as the Inflation Reduction Act, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, and the CHIPS Act are providing substantial incentives and creating immense demand for new factories, construction services, and logistics infrastructure. This legislative support is directly translating into increased industrial production and capital expenditures.

Furthermore, a monumental infrastructure spending boom is channeling significant investments into transportation networks, energy grids, and digital infrastructure across the nation. This sustained government outlay directly benefits companies supplying construction materials, engineering expertise, and heavy equipment, providing a predictable and long-term revenue stream for the sector. Simultaneously, the accelerating energy transition and electrification drive, intensified by the soaring electricity demands of artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure, is creating unprecedented opportunities for industrial firms specializing in power generation, renewable energy components, and grid modernization. Companies that are enabling this shift are seeing their order books swell.

Adding to this positive environment are easing inflation concerns and a more accommodating monetary policy from the Federal Reserve, including expected interest rate cuts in 2025. Lower borrowing costs stimulate corporate investment in expansion and upgrades, directly benefiting industrial equipment manufacturers and service providers. This resurgence is further bolstered by a renewed focus on manufacturing and automation, with advanced technologies like AI and robotics enhancing productivity and profitability across the sector. The aging global aerospace fleet also contributes to consistent demand for parts, maintenance, and new aircraft, providing a steady revenue stream for aerospace and defense players.

Winners and Losers: Navigating the Industrial Landscape

The current industrial renaissance is creating clear winners, with companies strategically positioned to benefit from the aforementioned trends. GE Vernova (NYSE: GEV) stands out as a prime example, having demonstrated exceptional growth since its spin-off from General Electric in April 2024. Focused exclusively on power generation and grid equipment, its valuation has skyrocketed from $37 billion to $156 billion, with an impressive 97.31% year-to-date stock rally by today's close. Its leadership in gas turbine technology and grid components makes it a direct beneficiary of the energy transition and the burgeoning demand for AI-driven electricity. The company also enjoys significant tailwinds from tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act.

Beyond GE Vernova, a broad spectrum of industrial companies are poised for continued success. Manufacturers of heavy construction equipment like Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE: CAT) are benefiting from infrastructure projects, while engineering and construction firms such as Jacobs Solutions Inc. (NYSE: J) are securing lucrative contracts for new facilities and infrastructure upgrades. Companies involved in renewable energy components and smart grid technologies, like Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE: ETN) and NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE: NEE), are seeing increased demand. Furthermore, firms providing industrial automation and robotics solutions to optimize manufacturing processes are also experiencing robust growth.

Conversely, companies that are slow to adapt to these evolving market dynamics may find themselves at a disadvantage. Industrial firms heavily reliant on outdated manufacturing processes, lacking investment in sustainable technologies, or with significant exposure to volatile international supply chains without a clear reshoring strategy, could face headwinds. Those unable to innovate or integrate advanced automation and AI into their operations risk falling behind more agile competitors. The shift towards domestic production also means that companies with limited U.S. manufacturing capabilities might need to re-evaluate their operational footprint to capitalize on government incentives and meet evolving customer demands.

Potential strategic pivots will include deeper integration of AI and machine learning into manufacturing processes, further investment in sustainable and circular economy practices, and the development of new solutions for grid modernization and renewable energy storage. Market opportunities will likely emerge in specialized niches within automation, advanced materials, and smart infrastructure. Challenges could arise from potential supply chain bottlenecks for critical components, skilled labor shortages, and unexpected shifts in geopolitical landscapes or regulatory environments.

Investors should anticipate a landscape characterized by continued innovation and strategic consolidation. The sector may see further spin-offs or mergers as companies streamline operations to focus on core growth areas. The ongoing electrification of transportation and industrial processes will also present significant opportunities. Scenarios range from sustained robust growth, particularly for companies aligned with green energy and digital transformation, to periods of consolidation as the market matures and efficiency becomes paramount.

Wrap-Up: A Resilient Sector Poised for Lasting Impact

In summary, the S&P 500 Industrials sector's significant positive performance today, spearheaded by market leader GE Vernova, highlights a powerful convergence of economic and policy catalysts. The relentless drive towards reshoring, massive infrastructure investments, and the global energy transition—supercharged by the demands of AI—are fundamentally reshaping the industrial landscape. These factors are not merely transient market fluctuations but represent deep-seated structural shifts that promise sustained growth for the sector.

Moving forward, the Industrials sector is poised for continued resilience and growth, making it a compelling area for investors seeking exposure to long-term economic transformation.

It plans to hire more bankers, investment professionals and other experts to help address its investment plan.","JPMorgan Chase will directly invest up to $10 billion in U.S. companies with crucial ties to national security.

The investment plan revealed Monday will focus on four areas: supply chain and advanced manufacturing in critical minerals, pharmaceutical precursors and robotics; defense and aerospace; energy independence, with investments in battery storage and grid resilience; and strategic technologies, including artificial intelligence, cybersecurity and quantum computing.

The investment is part of the bank’s Security and Resiliency Initiative, a $1.5 trillion, 10-year plan to facilitate, finance and invest in industries critical to national security.

“It has become painfully clear that the United States has allowed itself to become too reliant on unreliable sources of critical minerals, products and manufacturing – all of which are essential for our national security,” Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon said in a statement. “Our security is predicated on the strength and resiliency of America’s economy. America needs more speed and investment.”

This summer, JPMorgan helped put together a deal under which the Defense Department agreed to invest $400 million in U.S. rare earth company MP Materials. The bank is also providing financing for MP Materials’ second magnet producing factory in the U.S.

The nation’s largest bank plans to finance approximately $1 trillion over the next decade in support of clients in these industries. JPMorgan Chase is looking to increase this amount by up to $500 billion, or a 50% increase, with additional resources and capital.

“America needs more speed and investment,” Dimon said. “It also needs to remove obstacles that stand in the way: excessive regulations, bureaucratic delay, partisan gridlock and an education system not aligned to the skills we need.”

JPMorgan says that it serves 34,000 mid-sized companies and more than 90% of the Fortune 500.

Reuters reported that many automotive executives are bracing for a freefall in US EV sales because of the effects of the US inflation reduction act (IRA).
Tesla used incentives to maximise sales before the tax credit ended and posted record sales for the third quarter.
The history of the tax credit for EVs started in the US in 2008.
In that year, the US congress approved a $US7500 tax credit for buyers of electric cars and plug-in hybrid vehicles.","EV sales in the US could drop by half as the US this month killed off its $US7500 EV tax credit, said Ford CEO Jim Farley.

Mr Farley, speaking last week at the Ford Pro Accelerate summit in Detroit, said he saw a huge impact from the policy change.

As reported by Fortune magazine, Mr Farley said he believed manufacturing EVs was a “vibrant industry” but in the future, is “going to be smaller, way smaller than we thought.”

He said that the end of the $US7500 ($A11,430) consumer incentive was “a game-changer” and said he wouldn’t be surprised if EV sales in the US go down to 5 per cent of the industry from the current level of 10-12 per cent.

The fear is backed by a joint study in November 2024 by professors from three universities – University of California Berkeley, Duke University and Stanford University – that said EV registrations could fall 27 per cent without a tax credit.

Reuters reported that many automotive executives are bracing for a freefall in US EV sales because of the effects of the US inflation reduction act (IRA).

Aside from Ford, Nissan Americas chairman Christian Meunier said the EV market would “collapse” in October.

However, Volvo and Hyundai are at least two who aren’t too pessimistic about the EV subsidy withdrawal.

Volvo Car CEO Hakan Samuelsson told Reuters it would not change its strategy based on government policies.

“Our ambition is to be an electric company,” he said.

“That is not based on any tax credits or incentives. It’s based on an electric car being better

for US consumers.”

Hyundai Motor North America CEO Randy Parker said the company is offering a discount on its 2025 model Ioniq 5 EV of $US7500 – equivalent to the now discontinued government credit – and up to $US9800 ($A14,930) off the Ioniq 5’s 2026 model.

He said: “There was an EV market before IRA, and there’s going to be an EV market after IRA.”

In the fallout, some dealers said they were concerned that the removal of the tax credit would leave them with unsold EVs.

Nissan Americas’ chairman Meunier said competition “is going to be super-brutal, because there is a lot of stock.”

“Our competitors have built a lot of EVs,” he told Reuters. Nissan is now launching its new Leaf EV in the US.

But the biggest losers will be the pure EV manufacturers, including Tesla and Rivian, and battery makers.

Rivian reported an increase in sales of almost 32 per cent in the third quarter. It has reduced its forecast for the full year because of the end of the tax credit which hit the share price, pushing its share price down by more than 7 per cent.

Tesla used incentives to maximise sales before the tax credit ended and posted record sales for the third quarter.

US financial analyst firm Visible Alpha now estimates Tesla’s full-year 2025 sales will be about 10 per cent below 2024 which, in turn, was 8 per cent below 2023.

Fortune magazine said that battery makers face a growing US surplus. It said plans to build more battery factories have been shelved and that this would undermine a cornerstone of President Trump’s tariff regime designed to rebuild factories in the US.

Ford’s Jim Farley said that “customers are not interested in a $US75,000 ($A114,000) electric vehicle. They find them interesting. They’re fast. They’re efficient. You don’t go to the gas station. But they’re expensive.”But he said that customers were more interested in partial electrification.

“We think hybrid, EV plug-in, E-revs, those kinds of partial electric solutions, America is going to fall in love with, or already is falling in love with,” he said, and implied that those customers were also falling out of love with pure-EVs.

The history of the tax credit for EVs started in the US in 2008. In that year, the US congress approved a $US7500 tax credit for buyers of electric cars and plug-in hybrid vehicles.

The 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) extended the credit, while also limiting eligibility to EVs built in the US that use certain levels of domestically-sourced batteries and materials.

US president Donald Trump’s tax-cut and spending bill, signed into law in July, set the September 30 expiration.

His administration has taken other steps that could slow momentum for EVs, such as pausing the fines that car companies pay for failing to hit fuel-efficiency regulations.

Mr Trump campaigned last year on ending former president Joe Biden’s “EV mandate.”",https://premium.goauto.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Farley_25_Int-Feature-1600x470-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-14 02:57:48.083946

The agreement was formalized by Javier Imaz, Chief Purchasing Officer (CPO) of Gestamp, and Gilles Mirol, Chief Marketing Officer of Hydnum Steel.
Under the terms of the partnership, Gestamp —through its metal recycling subsidiary, Gescrap— will supply high-quality steel scrap from stamping processes to Hydnum Steel, which will then use renewable energy and green hydrogen to produce ultra-low CO₂ emission steel.
For Hydnum Steel, the extensive use of scrap metal as a raw material is central to applying circular economy principles to its production model.

The companies say the collaboration marks a significant step forward in the decarbonisation of the mobility sector.

The agreement was formalized by Javier Imaz, Chief Purchasing Officer (CPO) of Gestamp, and Gilles Mirol, Chief Marketing Officer of Hydnum Steel.

Under the terms of the partnership, Gestamp —through its metal recycling subsidiary, Gescrap— will supply high-quality steel scrap from stamping processes to Hydnum Steel, which will then use renewable energy and green hydrogen to produce ultra-low CO₂ emission steel.

The agreement also includes technical collaboration to develop steel grades that meet the automotive industry’s demanding standards in terms of chemical composition, mechanical properties, thickness, and finish. Gestamp will have priority access to these low-emission steels for the production of advanced metal components, further supporting the transition to sustainable mobility.

This collaboration will help advance circularity, a key pillar for decarbonizing the automotive supply chain and for achieving, in the long term, the Net Zero Car.

The initiative aligns with Gestamp’s decarbonisation strategy, which emphasizes the use of more sustainable raw materials, material recycling, and partnerships with strategic allies to drive cleaner and more efficient mobility. Recycling production scrap—especially steel and aluminium, which account for more than 70% of Gestamp’s total emissions due to their carbon-intensive production processes—is particularly critical.

Gestamp’s circularity model ensures the availability of high-quality scrap to produce ultra-low-emission steels, enabling full traceability of the material lifecycle through collection, sorting, and reintegration into the production chain.

For Hydnum Steel, the extensive use of scrap metal as a raw material is central to applying circular economy principles to its production model. Its Puertollano plant will be the first of its kind in the Iberian Peninsula, operating with an electric arc furnace powered exclusively by renewable energy. The substitution of natural gas with green hydrogen will reduce emissions by 98% compared to a traditional steel mill. The plant will also feature a closed-loop water treatment and reuse system, achieving zero discharge.

Javier Imaz, Chief Purchasing Officer (CPO) of Gestamp, said: “This agreement marks another step forward in our efforts to decarbonize the automotive industry and strengthens our circular economy model, which is based on the sustainable management of resources and the reuse of our high-quality scrap in steel production”.

Gilles Mirol, Chief Marketing Officer (CMO) of Hydnum Steel, said: “The partnership reflects the commitment of both companies to advancing a sustainable and efficient European industry. Hydnum Steel’s plant is a flagship project for the energy transition and will produce steel with the utmost respect for the environment”.",https://www.just-auto.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/30/2025/10/Javier-Imaz-and-Gilles-Mirol.jpg,N,,2025-10-14 05:58:32.397640

""Reversing the harmful effects of climate change and making our community climate-resilient will require both bold policy solutions and collective action on the part of residents,"" she said.
According to the Department of Energy, drivers can expect to save up to $2,200 per year on fuel costs for a fully electric vehicle and around $1,500 for a plug-in hybrid.
Are you thinking about buying an electric vehicle?","While the electric vehicle tax credit expired Sept. 30, residents in Burlington, Vermont, can still snag up to $5,700 in EV rebates through the Burlington Electric Department.

As WPTZ reported, the EV incentive program launched Oct. 1 and will run through 2026, offering residents a refund of $5,000 or $5,700 for income-eligible buyers. City leaders announced the program in late September, noting that the incentive offers have doubled compared to a former EV rebate program, which provided rebates of $2,300 or $3,000, depending on income.

Burlington Mayor Emma Mulvaney-Stanak told NBC5 that, despite the federal EV tax credits ending seven years earlier than anticipated, the city is doing its best to promote a healthy, eco-friendly environment and help residents make sustainable choices.

""Reversing the harmful effects of climate change and making our community climate-resilient will require both bold policy solutions and collective action on the part of residents,"" she said.

Tax breaks and rebates can make it easier to switch to an EV, but even without the incentives, EV owners can still save a fortune on gas, maintenance, and other expenses compared to gas-powered vehicles.

According to the Department of Energy, drivers can expect to save up to $2,200 per year on fuel costs for a fully electric vehicle and around $1,500 for a plug-in hybrid.

If you charge your EV at home with solar panels, you could save an additional 60% each year, according to EnergySage, and spend less time waiting at charging stations. The company estimates that the average EV owner may spend around $300 charging their car at home with solar energy, compared to up to $700 using grid electricity, and a staggering $2,500 for a gas-fueled vehicle.

With electricity and car repair bills skyrocketing, it's never been a better time to level up to an EV.

Not to mention, electric vehicles are significantly better for the planet compared to polluting gas cars, which contribute to rising temperatures and more extreme weather. A study by the Argonne National Laboratory, a DOE-funded science and engineering research lab, found that EV drivers reduce carbon pollution by 1 pound per mile, which equates to roughly 75% less pollution generated compared to a conventional gas car.

The more drivers that adopt EVs, the easier it will be on their wallets and the environment. Even though the tax credits have expired, 13 states are still offering tax breaks and rebates for purchasing an EV, according to personal finance experts at Money. Additionally, the federal tax credit for EV charging equipment remains available until mid-2026, covering up to $1,000 for residential installations and up to $100,000 for businesses, as per the Internal Revenue Service.

Currently, only 4% of terrestrial, utility-scale renewable capacity sits on federal land, according to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.","An enormous solar project planned for the Nevada desert was canceled last week while awaiting final federal approvals, an ominous sign for renewables development on public lands under the Trump administration.

Esmeralda 7 was unique for its size: It would have installed 6.2 gigawatts of solar generation and 5.2 gigawatts of battery capacity across 62,300 acres of Nevada desert. No other solar project in the U.S. comes close to that scale. It was also a test case for a new, more efficient approach to federal permitting, one that promised to get clean energy infrastructure built more quickly.

The solar colossus incorporated seven distinct solar-and-battery projects from different developers on adjacent parcels of land overseen by the federal Bureau of Land Management. Instead of each going through an exhaustive process to attain federal permits, the projects banded together to undergo a joint analysis by the BLM. The bureau completed a draft environmental review of the megaproject under the Biden administration, but didn’t release a final version. Instead, as first reported by Heatmap, the BLM website switched the project status to ​“cancelled” on Thursday.

It’s not yet clear if the decision to cancel was made by the BLM or Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, or if the Esmeralda 7 developers pulled out, perhaps based on conversations with the government. An automated email reply from Scott Distel, the BLM contact for the project, said he is not authorized to work during the government shutdown and thus was unable to respond.

The BLM circulated a statement to media on Friday saying that ​“applicants will now have the option to submit individual project proposals to the BLM to more effectively analyze potential impacts.” Such a move would entail repeating the already-conducted environmental analysis for each project individually, after which the administration could simply move to cancel the projects again.

“While we await further clarity from BLM on its apparent decision to abruptly cancel these solar projects in the late stages of the review process, we remain deeply concerned that this administration continues to flout the law to the detriment of consumers, the grid, and America’s economic competitiveness,” Ben Norris, vice president of regulatory affairs at the Solar Energy Industries Association, wrote in a statement Friday.

President Donald Trump swept into office declaring an ​“energy emergency” and pledging to unleash more American energy and bring down prices. Since then, though, his administration has intervened to obstruct several major power projects that would deliver renewable electricity to the grid at a time of swiftly rising power demand.

The White House attempted to halt two fully permitted offshore wind farms, the 810-megawatt Empire Wind 1 and the 704-megawatt Revolution Wind. Offshore wind requires permissions from the Interior Department’s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, giving the administration leverage over this type of private enterprise. Those efforts to stop construction did not hold up, but they incurred millions of dollars of unanticipated costs for the developers, and damaged the country’s reputation as a safe place to invest in billion-dollar infrastructure projects.

Currently, only 4% of terrestrial, utility-scale renewable capacity sits on federal land, according to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. But in the U.S. West, many federal parcels are well-suited for renewable energy; if these sites were successfully developed, they could greatly increase clean energy production.

Esmeralda 7 appears to be the first large renewable development on public lands to be officially cancelled during the Trump administration, said Ted Kelly, director and lead counsel for U.S. clean energy at the Environmental Defense Fund.

Previously, he added, some projects that were expected to move forward were ​“sitting in limbo,” neither cancelled nor approved on schedule. Now, Kelly said, there’s ​“a real concern” that public lands may be effectively off limits for wind or solar development for the duration of the Trump administration.

While it lasted, Esmeralda 7 modeled a new, more streamlined way to analyze a huge amount of renewable capacity.

“It increases efficiency on the government side, not having to recreate the same review of the same type of impact over and over again,” Kelly noted. Combining the permitting also helps in scrutinizing the cumulative effect of multiple projects, something environmental advocates have pushed for.

The BLM released its draft environmental impact statement in late July 2024, kicking off a 90-day comment period, which included an in-person public meeting and an online one.

The project would have impacted the desert landscape. But the draft environmental review identified those impacts and outlined mitigation efforts needed to protect endangered species and minimize disruption to desert plants. Esmeralda 7 also would have had environmental benefits by displacing polluting power production with emissions-free generation.

Projects that undergo thorough vetting and abide by the government’s conditions have a legal right to move forward, Kelly said. Under U.S. law, the government can’t cancel a project without mustering a set of reasons and evidence; the Administrative Procedures Act forbids ​“arbitrary and capricious” decisions that violate due process.

“It’s inconsistent with the law, but it’s also obviously inconsistent with what our country needs,” Kelly said of the cancellation.

Several prominent voices outside the clean energy industry expressed alarm at the news. Utah’s Republican Gov. Spencer Cox blasted the cancellation on X, writing, ​“This is how we lose the AI/​energy arms race with China. … Solar with batteries can now be close to baseload power and we should keep these projects rolling until we get the gas/​nuclear/​geothermal plants we need.”

Billionaire John Arnold, who made a name for himself as a gas trader at Enron, also tweeted about the cancellation, saying, ​“I’m increasingly worried we’re headed for the cliff.” Coal, hydropower, and nuclear are not projected to grow much in this decade, he noted, so ​“all growth has to come from gas, solar & wind.”",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/GettyImages-1395198787-copy.jpeg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=72c3ce295ff9e1d8de823ca099bba1b5,N,,2025-10-13 21:59:15.923299

Virginia’s solar market remains robust, but the 2025 cutoff marks a pivotal moment.","Alexandria, VA – Virginia’s solar energy landscape has been boosted by the federal Residential Clean Energy Credit, often referred to as the solar tax credit, which offers homeowners a 30% reimbursement on the cost of installing solar panels, batteries, and related equipment. This incentive, extended under the Inflation Reduction Act, has made solar more affordable, reducing installation costs by thousands for the average household. In Virginia, where sunny conditions and rising energy bills make solar appealing, the credit has spurred widespread adoption, with over 10,000 residential systems installed in recent years.

However, federal legislation signed by President Trump on July 4, 2025, accelerates the credit’s end date to December 31, 2025—nearly a decade earlier than originally planned. Previously set to continue through 2032 at a stepped-down rate, the credit will now vanish entirely after 2025, eliminating the 30% deduction for systems placed in service starting January 1, 2026. This change stems from budget reconciliation efforts prioritizing fiscal restraint, though it has drawn criticism from environmental groups for hindering clean energy progress.

For Virginians, the implications are stark. A typical 7kW solar system costing $20,000 could save $6,000 via the credit—savings that disappear post-2025. Local incentives, like Charlottesville’s property tax credit (up to 0.98% annually for five years on system value), persist but pale in comparison. Net metering, which credits excess energy to utility bills, remains intact statewide, but without the federal boost, payback periods could extend from 6 to 8 years to over a decade.

Homeowners should act swiftly: Secure quotes now and aim to complete installations by year-end to qualify. As of September 2025, demand is surging, with installers reporting backlogs. This deadline underscores the urgency of transitioning to renewables amid Virginia’s ambitious clean energy goals, potentially slowing momentum toward a sustainable future. With the federal solar tax credit expiring on December 31, 2025, Virginians face a critical window to capitalize on the 30% cost reduction for solar installations. Delaying could mean missing out on thousands in savings, as local incentives like Charlottesville’s modest property tax credit or net metering can’t match the federal benefit’s impact. Homeowners should prioritize securing contracts and scheduling installations now, as installers face growing backlogs amid heightened demand.

The abrupt end to the credit, driven by fiscal policy shifts, has sparked debate. Supporters argue it aligns with budget priorities, while critics warn it undermines Virginia’s goal of 100% clean energy by 2050. Without the credit, solar adoption may slow, extending reliance on fossil fuels and increasing household energy costs over time. For a 7kW system, the loss of a $6,000 credit could stretch payback periods significantly, making solar less accessible for middle-income families.

To maximize savings, homeowners should consult certified installers, verify eligibility for remaining local incentives, and ensure systems are operational by the deadline. Community solar programs, which don’t rely on individual installations, may offer an alternative for renters or those unable to install panels. Virginia’s solar market remains robust, but the 2025 cutoff marks a pivotal moment. Acting now ensures financial benefits and supports the state’s clean energy vision, preserving momentum toward a greener, more resilient energy future.",https://storage.googleapis.com/stateless-ceoblognation-com/2025/10/29671db0-facebook-ad-2025-10-13t205025.601.jpg,N,,2025-10-13 21:59:37.121624

The Conversation is an independent and nonprofit source of news, analysis and commentary from academic experts.

You might imagine nuclear power plants as behemoth facilities spanning hundreds of acres. Nuclear microreactors, by contrast, could sit on land the size of a football field and power a whole town.

However, after decades of fraught relationships between the nuclear industry and communities in many parts of the U.S., building these tiny reactors requires reckoning with the complex history of nuclear technology and rebuilding public trust.

Microreactor technology for use in towns or cities hasn’t been developed yet, but many researchers have been building the case for its use.

For example, this technology could benefit college campuses, remote communities in Alaska primarily powered by oil and diesel, tech companies looking for reliable electricity for AI data centers, companies in need of high-temperature heat for manufacturing and industrial processes, mining operations that need a clean energy source and even military bases in search of a secure source of energy.

I’m a nuclear engineer who has been exploring nuclear microreactors’ potential. My research and teaching focuses on some of the questions that would come with placing miniature nuclear reactors close to where people live.

Microreactors: A history

Nuclear microreactors as a technology are both new and old. In the 1940s and ’50s, the American military and government began developing small reactors and nuclear batteries to power submarines and spacecraft.

After developing these small-scale reactors and batteries for various missions, the nuclear industry’s focus shifted to power reactors. They began to rapidly scale up their designs from producing tens of megawatts to the gigawatt-scale systems common around the world today.

These historical reactors were small because scientists were still learning about the physics and engineering underlying these systems. Today, engineers are deliberately designing microreactors to be small.

Microreactors aren’t to be confused with small modular reactors — these are often scaled-down, modularized versions of large reactors. Small, modular reactors can be built as single units or in clusters to achieve the same capacity as a full-size reactor. Microreactors would be smaller than these, with a power capacity under 20 megawatts.

Manufacturing and cost

Because they’re small, microreactors wouldn’t require a massive, multiyear construction project like large nuclear power reactors. Several units could be assembled in a factory each year and shipped off to their final destinations in a truck or on a barge.

Large reactors are not inherently flawed — in many ways, they remain the more economic nuclear energy option. However, electric utility companies have recently hesitated to invest in large reactors because of the multibillion-dollar nature of these projects.

Microreactors require a different but equally significant kind of investment. Though individual units will have a significantly lower price tag, building a factory to produce these microreactors is a massive undertaking. Reactor companies are waiting for their order books to fill up before investing in factories.

It’s a catch-22. Without orders, technology developers are unlikely to build microreactor factories. And future users of these new reactors are unlikely to place orders until this new style of production has been tested and the initial units built.

Future users are also waiting to see what the microreactors will actually cost. Reactor developers have put forward many cost estimates, but in the past, estimates for nuclear reactors haven’t always been reliable. Developers likely won’t know the true numbers until the reactors are actually built.

Initial “first of a kind” units will undoubtedly cost significantly more than later units. As manufacturers learn the best production processes, they’ll be able to make more reactors for less.

In this paradoxical situation in which developers are waiting for orders and users are waiting to see the economics of initial reactors, government funding for building demonstration projects could help usher microreactor technology from early designs to the market.

First movers such as national laboratories, universities, data centers and military bases that are willing to buy these initial reactors also have a role to play in validating the economic feasibility of these new reactors.

Today’s microreactors

In a nuclear reactor, the combination of nuclear fuel and coolant — which is the substance used to both cool the fuel and transport the heat generated by it — used in its design determines what situations it will work best in. Many nonwater coolants can allow reactors to operate at lower pressures, which is a little more safe.

The microreactors being developed today are based on a wide range of reactor technologies and make use of many different combinations of nuclear fuels and coolants.

Some reactors, such as the submarine propulsion reactors, are small, pressurized water reactors — the same basic technology used in most large-scale nuclear power plants. Others use configurations that resemble the small reactors in spacecraft. Still others make use of nuclear fuel and coolant combinations previously attempted in much larger reactors, such as high-temperature gas reactors, sodium fast reactors and even molten salt reactors.

Though encompassing a range of technologies, microreactors are all significantly simpler than the large reactors in use today. In many cases, they have few to no moving parts.

Microreactors, by virtue of being significantly simpler, are going to be more knowable. Because they’re easier to study and understand, simpler reactor systems have fewer points of failure and safety concerns.

Complex systems, such as the large nuclear power reactors, can be fundamentally unknowable, with unexpected entanglements of “unknown unknowns” creating instabilities, safety concerns and potential for failure. Large reactors operate safely today because we have learned about these unknown unknowns over decades of operation. Microreactors, because of their simplicity, will fundamentally be safer and more predictable than the large reactors were when they were first built.

Siting microreactors

Although the Department of Energy oversees microreactor demonstration projects, commercial deployment of microreactors requires approval from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which could take several years and may ultimately determine how soon commercial reactors can be built. Several designs are now approaching or in the early stages of review.

To keep people safe, large reactors have designated emergency planning zones — usually 10 and 50 miles around — which require different degrees of planning and protection to enter. The 10-mile zone has specific shelters and evacuation plans in place, while people in the 50-mile zone may need to take precautions about what they eat and drink in the event of a catastrophic accident but will not need to evacuate.

Because microreactors are smaller and simpler, developers and regulators may significantly reduce their emergency planning zones. The zones could extend only to the facility’s site boundary, or perhaps a few hundred meters beyond it.

A reduced emergency planning zone could mean that microreactors could be built in towns and cities, or embedded in remote communities. They might one day become as ubiquitous as the solar panels and windmills you see when driving through the countryside. And like the submarine reactors that can power a small underwater community of 100, one microreactor could power a rural town.

But even if siting a nuclear microreactor near a town is technically feasible, would the community accept it?

Public engagement

My lab’s ongoing research suggests that the answer to this question is contingent on how technology developers engage with the communities that may host a microreactor. If they attempt to unilaterally decide, announce and defend their decision to build a microreactor without input, communities will likely push back.

However, if developers work with communities to understand their hopes, concerns and priorities, they will likely find that many people are receptive to hyperlocal nuclear energy facilities.

My team’s initial findings suggest that there isn’t a one-size-fits-all approach for designing these facilities. Each community will have its own set of preferences that developers will need to navigate alongside the engineering questions.

In our discussions with community members in southeast Michigan, my research team has seen interest in designing these small energy facilities as a feature of the community that’s easily accessible to local residents. Community members designing hypothetical microreactor facilities with us have proposed shared spaces, recreational facilities, onsite visitor centers or science museums, and public art projects. Instead of hiding these facilities out of sight, they want these places to be inviting and beautiful.

“Manufacturers won’t bother making outdated, short-range hybrids just for smaller markets,” one industry analyst noted.
Instead, automakers are doubling down on extended-range electric vehicles (EREVs) — hybrids that run primarily on electric power but include a small gasoline engine as backup.
New fuel economy standards will also make combustion engines inside plug-in hybrids more efficient.
By enforcing a higher minimum standard, China is effectively raising the global bar for plug-in hybrids and redefining what qualifies as a “modern” hybrid.","Starting January 1, 2026, all plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) exported from China will be required to deliver at least 100 kilometers of battery-only range — a bold move that is set to shake up automakers worldwide.

The new regulation, part of China’s evolving New Energy Vehicle (NEV) strategy, signals a decisive shift from quantity to quality in automotive exports.

It reflects Beijing’s response to mounting trade barriers, such as the European Union’s tariffs on Chinese battery-electric vehicles (BEVs), while underscoring a push for higher technological standards across its auto industry.

China’s NEV exports — especially plug-in hybrids — have been surging. Exports jumped 190% year-on-year in 2024, and by May 2025, they were up another 127%, with shipments to the EU skyrocketing nearly 600% thanks to tariff advantages.

In 2024 alone, China exported 6.41 million vehicles, generating about $117.4 billion in revenue — but export volumes in 2025 are expected to ease slightly to around 5.8 to 6.2 million units as the country prioritizes higher-end models.

The new 100km rule means that short-range plug-in hybrids — often capable of only 50km or less on battery power — are effectively obsolete.

For consumers, this means that many PHEVs sold today could lose value quickly. “Manufacturers won’t bother making outdated, short-range hybrids just for smaller markets,” one industry analyst noted.

Instead, automakers are doubling down on extended-range electric vehicles (EREVs) — hybrids that run primarily on electric power but include a small gasoline engine as backup.

Brands like Zeekr and Xpeng are already producing PHEVs and EREVs boasting 300 to 400+ km of electric range and charging speeds jumping from 50kW to as high as 500kW.

In major cities, only EVs, PHEVs, and EREVs qualify for new car registrations or number plates. That makes the new 100km rule a natural filter: only long-range hybrids will be considered future-proof.

New fuel economy standards will also make combustion engines inside plug-in hybrids more efficient. The result: owners will drive in full-electric mode for most trips, making these new hybrids behave almost like pure EVs — without the range anxiety.

Industry experts see the law as a “game-changer”. By enforcing a higher minimum standard, China is effectively raising the global bar for plug-in hybrids and redefining what qualifies as a “modern” hybrid.

Short-range models will likely be sold off as old stock, but producing them in the long term will no longer make economic sense. As one insider put it, “This policy marks the end of the low-range plug-in era.”

Within months of implementation, market analysts expect a massive shift toward long-range hybrids, creating new benchmarks for performance, efficiency, and export competitiveness.

China’s 100km rule isn’t just a technical regulation — it’s a strategic pivot. It will force global automakers to upgrade, innovate, or be left behind.

By 2026, the age of short-range plug-in hybrids will be over — and the world’s next wave of electrified vehicles will almost certainly have “Made in China” stamped on them.",https://media.assettype.com/gulfnews%2F2024-11-18%2Fv3tmci8a%2FStock___BYD_Atto_3_188e1cbf42a_original_ratio.jpg?w=1200&ar=40%3A21&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true&mode=crop&enlarge=true&overlay=false&overlay_position=bottom&overlay_width=100,N,,2025-10-13 22:58:49.234236

As much as 90 percent of all battery-electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles sold in the United States through the first nine months of the year are believed to have benefited from some form of tax credit, according to market research firm Rho Motion.

A Surge Before the Deadline

The end of the federal EV tax credit on October 1 set off a nationwide rush for qualifying models, driving record sales for several brands and pushing overall EV demand to new highs in August and September.

This year, the EPA determined that 20 battery-electric vehicles and a single plug-in hybrid model were eligible for the New Clean Vehicle Credit, valued at up to $7,500. These vehicles together accounted for 55 percent of all EV sales from January through September.

Leasing Loopholes and Fleet Boosts

Of equal importance in propping up sales was the lesser-known Qualified Commercial Clean Vehicle Credit, also valued at up to $7,500.

This credit was available for vehicles weighing less than 14,000 lbs and aimed at fleet and business buyers. This is also the credit that allowed car manufacturers to claim the tax credit themselves, and then to reduce the lease price on new vehicles.

Notably, leased passenger cars and trucks were not subject to the same sourcing and assembly requirements as purchased vehicles. They also didn’t need to be built in North America, which made leasing an especially attractive option for both manufacturers and buyers.

As the September 30 axing date for the credits drew closer, sales of electrified vehicles surged across the United States. As noted by Rho Motion, Ford sold 30,612 battery-electric vehicles in the third quarter, a huge 86 percent increase from Q2.

Additionally, GM’s BEV sales jumped 44 percent to 66,501 units. Tesla also reported a 27 percent sales increase, and Hyundai also enjoyed substantial growth, thanks to a more than doubling of demand for the Ioniq 5.

What Comes After the Incentives?

It remains to be seen how sharply BEV and PHEV sales will dip in the fourth quarter now that the tax credit has ended. Rho Motion expects demand to “decline sharply.”

The research firm also points out that tariffs, high local manufacturing costs, and relaxed fuel efficiency standards are likely to deter investment in domestic EV production, creating further pressure on demand in the months ahead.",https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Kia-2026_EV4-copy-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-13 21:00:08.471030

By Eric Starkman

Here’s an undeniable truth about GM CEO Mary Barra and her “north star” zero-emissions, green-energy ambitions: they were all predicated on the charity of U.S. taxpayers.

Barra’s EV crusade was powered not by visionary risk, but by feeding from the public trough—generous taxpayer rebates even for EVs built in Mexico; taxpayers asked to fund the charging infrastructure necessary for mass adoption; taxpayers expected to bankroll the retooling of U.S. factories for EV production.

Barra apparently assumed President Biden—to whom she reportedly was close and whose chief legislative aide was a former GM lobbyist—would win reelection. When Americans instead sent Donald Trump back to the White House, Barra’s taxpayer gravy train was abruptly derailed.

Trump quickly moved to eliminate taxpayer EV subsidies. We’ll soon learn how well GM’s electric lineup performs without government welfare. But before that reckoning, Barra already has axed another promised “clean energy” initiative at the mere hint that taxpayer handouts might stop.

Barra’s Hydrogen Hot Air

GM last week scrapped plans for a Detroit factory and killed its hydrogen-fuel-cell program for everyday drivers. Hydrogen fuel cells generate electricity by combining hydrogen and oxygen, producing only water vapor as exhaust. GM once touted the technology as a clean-energy bridge between gasoline and battery power—one that could have given Detroit a legitimate green edge.

Not coincidentally, the decision came days after the Trump administration floated canceling two federal grants totaling $52 million that the Biden administration had awarded GM for hydrogen development in Pontiac. GM had already mooched $9 million of that money.

Salaried workers in Pontiac tied to GM’s Hydrotec division were summarily dismissed. GM spokesman Stu Fowle declined to say how many. The Detroit factory would have employed 144 people and cost $55 million, in partnership with a subsidiary of Piston Automotive (owned by former Detroit Pistons star Vinnie Johnson). That project is now dead.

“Every company has to look at and prioritize where we apply our resources,” Fowle told the Detroit News.

Translation: with the mere threat of the subsidies disappearing, GM’s hydrogen ambitions immediately vanished with them.

Billions for Buybacks

Meanwhile, GM has spent $25 billion in the past three years buying back its stock—legal market manipulation that artificially inflated GM’s underperforming share price under Barra’s leadership. Barra has personally profited handsomely: she sold a trove of shares in 2024 and pocketed $82 million, more than the entire cost of the hydrogen venture she just killed. She recently unloaded another 40 percent of her GM holdings.

Barra’s retreat from hydrogen stands in stark contrast to Toyota and BMW, which continue investing in fuel-cell technology. Even Ford maintains hydrogen research for its heavy-duty vehicles.

Unlike Barra, the CEOs of Toyota and BMW didn’t rush blindly into EVs before consumers or infrastructure were ready. They’re building long-term capabilities; Barra chased short-term taxpayer subsidy checks.

Shamefully, Barra’s annual compensation—roughly $29 million—is about five times that of Toyota’s CEO, who runs a larger, more profitable global company.

Gov. Whitmer’s Disgrace

GM years ago was awarded $3.5 billion in Michigan grants and subsidies on the condition that it keep 4,000 jobs at Detroit’s Renaissance Center headquarters. Governor Gretchen Whitmer quietly relieved Barra of that requirement in exchange for GM’s commitment to “Factory Zero,” its heavily subsidized EV plant in Detroit.

The future of Factory Zero, where GM builds its GMC EV Hummer and Cadillac Escalade IQ, already looks shaky. About 280 employees there remain on layoff through year-end according to the Detroit Free Press. A popular YouTuber recently reported attending an auction featuring 20 brand-new, never-driven EV Hummers—vehicles that can easily retail north of six figures. When your “green halo” product goes straight from factory to auction block, that’s cause for alarm.

Adding insult to injury, a climate group has deemed the Hummer more environmentally harmful than most gas-engine vehicles. Tellingly, Barra reportedly tools around town in a black EV Hummer. Nothing says “sustainability” like a 9,000-plus-pound electric monster—a vehicle multiple reviewers said had inadequate brakes for its brawn.

GM’s Headquarters?

GM refuses to disclose how many employees it will house in its supposed new headquarters inside Dan Gilbert’s heavily subsidized Hudson’s Detroit tower. The automaker is leasing just four floors—it’s a safe bet the edifice won’t even house half the 4,000 employees GM was once required to employ in Detroit.

With more than 20,000 employees at its Warren Tech Center and key executives scattered across Silicon Valley, Austin, and a ranch in Montana, GM’s Hudson’s Detroit space is literally headquarters window dressing, given that its logo adorns the building.",https://d2nyfqh3g1stw3.cloudfront.net/photos/featured_mary_barra_58761.jpg,N,,2025-10-13 21:00:21.312123

Bunch noted that EV sales had stayed around 25% of new cars in 2023 and 2024, dipped earlier this year, then jumped to a record 29% in the third quarter.
Without the rebate deadline, Bunch said, EV sales likely would have declined slightly for the first time.
“Although the 29% figure is nice to see, this does not change the fact that EV sales have flattened out after very large growth a few years ago,” he added.
“In the 50 years since the Clean Air Act was enacted, waivers have never been subject to the CRA,” Attorney General Rob Bonta’s news release stated in June.","Gov. Gavin Newsom on Monday celebrated Californians’ purchase of more than 124,700 zero-emission vehicles in the third quarter of 2025.

The announcement comes as California fights the federal government in court over its clean-car authority and as the One Big, Beautiful Act ends federal EV tax credits, reshaping state electric vehicle goals across the country.

“This is unprecedented – we’re nearing a third of all new vehicles sold in the fourth-largest economy on the planet being clean cars,” Newsom said in a news release.

“While Trump sells out American innovation to China, California will keep charging ahead on our path to a future of cleaner air.”

Sales surge ahead of rebate deadline

Experts attribute the strong sales numbers to the phaseout of federal EV tax credits.

The Trump administration’s One Big, Beautiful Act ended federal EV incentives last month, cutting off rebates of up to $7,500 for new and $4,000 for used zero-emission vehicles purchased after September 30, 2025.

“Sales are notably higher than they would have been, although it is difficult to say exactly how much higher,” wrote David Bunch, professor emeritus of Graduate School of Management at the University of California, in an email.

Bunch noted that EV sales had stayed around 25% of new cars in 2023 and 2024, dipped earlier this year, then jumped to a record 29% in the third quarter. Without the rebate deadline, Bunch said, EV sales likely would have declined slightly for the first time.

“Although the 29% figure is nice to see, this does not change the fact that EV sales have flattened out after very large growth a few years ago,” he added.

Alan Jenn, an assistant professor at the Institute of Transportation Studies at UC Davis agreed the strong sales numbers are likely connected to the sunsetting of federal tax credits, as many consumers rushed to take advantage of the rebates before they disappear. At the same time, he doesn’t expect demand to “collapse” moving forward.

“While we know that incentives helped to increase sales, they were not responsible for all of the sales that happened in the past ... studies typically show 20%-50% increase in sales thanks to incentives, so the remaining would likely still happen.”

California’s fight to defend its clean-car authority

California is currently in a legal battle to overturn the Congressional Review Act resolutions signed by President Trump that aim to revoke federal waivers permitting the state to set its own vehicle emissions standards toward 100% zero-emission new car sales by 2035.

In June, the Trump administration signed three CRA resolutions overturning several of California’s major climate programs, including its Advanced Clean Cars II rules, the latest evolution of the state’s zero-emission vehicle rules. They remain unenforceable amid ongoing litigation, leaving California with only regulatory guidance and no binding mandates in effect for now.

“We are determined to defend our authority in court so we can reduce these harmful air emissions and continue to move the market forward,” Lindsay Buckley, a spokesperson for the California Air Resources Board, said Monday.

In response to Trump’s move, California’s top officials sued the federal government, asserting that the action violates federal law and undermines decades of climate progress, endangering California’s economy and the health of its residents.

“In the 50 years since the Clean Air Act was enacted, waivers have never been subject to the CRA,” Attorney General Rob Bonta’s news release stated in June.

When vehicle design compromises emergency exit capability, we must examine whether innovation is adequately balanced with occupant protection.”

— Michael Avanesian

LOS ANGELES, CA, UNITED STATES, October 13, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- Federal safety regulators launched an investigation into Tesla's electronic door systems following a November 2024 crash that claimed three college students' lives after they became trapped inside a Cybertruck in Piedmont, California. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) probe encompasses 174,000 Tesla Model Y vehicles amid mounting evidence of electronic door system failures.

California Personal Injury attorney Michael Avanesian of Avian Law Group states that Tesla's electronic door systems present safety concerns that prioritize technological innovation over emergency egress principles. Recent wrongful death lawsuits filed by families of 19-year-old Krysta Tsukahara (Tsukahara v. Dixon, Alameda County Superior Court) and 20-year-old Jack Nelson (Nelson v. Tesla Inc., Case No. 25CV120058, Alameda County Superior Court) allege Tesla's door design prevented their escape from the burning vehicle.

""This case demonstrates the intersection of advanced technology and fundamental safety requirements,"" said Avanesian. ""When vehicle design compromises emergency exit capability, we must examine whether innovation is adequately balanced with occupant protection.""

Federal Investigation Reveals Pattern of System Failures

NHTSA data documents more than 140 consumer complaints regarding Tesla door malfunctions across various models since 2018. The September 2025 investigation (NHTSA Investigation No. PE25-016) targets electronic door handle failures affecting Model Y vehicles, with documented cases of occupants unable to exit vehicles during emergencies.

The Cybertruck operates exclusively through electronic controls that fail when vehicles lose power during crashes. While manual releases exist, they are positioned beneath rubber mats and may be difficult to locate during emergencies, particularly for rear-seat passengers.

Tesla's design chief Franz von Holzhausen acknowledged the need for ""more intuitive door mechanisms during emergency situations"" in September 2025. The company announced plans to redesign door handles, combining electronic and manual releases.

Rising Product Liability in Electric Vehicle Sector

Tesla door defect cases emerge within escalating product liability litigation. Electric vehicle defects present unique litigation challenges. While EVs demonstrate superior fire safety statistics – 0.00044% fire rate compared to 0.1% for internal combustion vehicles – their complex electronic systems create failure modes that can impact occupant egress during emergencies.

""We are observing a shift in automotive liability as manufacturers implement sophisticated electronic systems,"" Avanesian explained. ""The legal system must address emerging risks associated with electronic vehicle technologies that may impact consumer safety.""

Regulatory Framework and International Standards

Current Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards were established before widespread electronic door system adoption and do not comprehensively address emergency egress requirements. The recently established FMVSS No. 305a focuses primarily on battery safety without comprehensive emergency escape provisions.

China has implemented stricter door handle safety requirements, mandating every door feature external mechanical handles and clearly marked internal releases positioned within 300mm of door edges. European regulators are considering restrictions on fully concealed door handles following safety concerns.

Legal Proceedings and Industry Impact

Avanesian predicts Tesla door defect cases will establish precedents for electric vehicle product liability. ""These lawsuits will determine standards for balancing design innovation with fundamental safety requirements,"" he said. ""The outcome will influence industry practices and consumer protection standards for the electric vehicle sector.""

The wrongful death lawsuits seek unspecified damages and are scheduled for trial in February 2027. Legal experts anticipate additional cases as awareness of door system failures increases among vehicle owners.

As federal investigators examine Tesla's door systems, the electric vehicle industry faces evaluation of safety standards that will determine how innovation integrates with consumer protection requirements.

Bunch noted that EV sales had stayed around 25% of new cars in 2023 and 2024, dipped earlier this year, then jumped to a record 29% in the third quarter.
Without the rebate deadline, Bunch said, EV sales likely would have declined slightly for the first time.
“Although the 29% figure is nice to see, this does not change the fact that EV sales have flattened out after very large growth a few years ago,” he added.
“In the 50 years since the Clean Air Act was enacted, waivers have never been subject to the CRA,” Attorney General Rob Bonta’s news release stated in June.","Gov. Gavin Newsom on Monday celebrated Californians’ purchase of more than 124,700 zero-emission vehicles in the third quarter of 2025.

The announcement comes as California fights the federal government in court over its clean-car authority and as the One Big, Beautiful Act ends federal EV tax credits, reshaping state electric vehicle goals across the country.

“This is unprecedented – we’re nearing a third of all new vehicles sold in the fourth-largest economy on the planet being clean cars,” Newsom said in a news release.

“While Trump sells out American innovation to China, California will keep charging ahead on our path to a future of cleaner air.”

Sales surge ahead of rebate deadline

Experts attribute the strong sales numbers to the phaseout of federal EV tax credits.

The Trump administration’s One Big, Beautiful Act ended federal EV incentives last month, cutting off rebates of up to $7,500 for new and $4,000 for used zero-emission vehicles purchased after September 30, 2025.

“Sales are notably higher than they would have been, although it is difficult to say exactly how much higher,” wrote David Bunch, professor emeritus of Graduate School of Management at the University of California, in an email.

Bunch noted that EV sales had stayed around 25% of new cars in 2023 and 2024, dipped earlier this year, then jumped to a record 29% in the third quarter. Without the rebate deadline, Bunch said, EV sales likely would have declined slightly for the first time.

“Although the 29% figure is nice to see, this does not change the fact that EV sales have flattened out after very large growth a few years ago,” he added.

Alan Jenn, an assistant professor at the Institute of Transportation Studies at UC Davis agreed the strong sales numbers are likely connected to the sunsetting of federal tax credits, as many consumers rushed to take advantage of the rebates before they disappear. At the same time, he doesn’t expect demand to “collapse” moving forward.

“While we know that incentives helped to increase sales, they were not responsible for all of the sales that happened in the past ... studies typically show 20%-50% increase in sales thanks to incentives, so the remaining would likely still happen.”

California’s fight to defend its clean-car authority

California is currently in a legal battle to overturn the Congressional Review Act resolutions signed by President Trump that aim to revoke federal waivers permitting the state to set its own vehicle emissions standards toward 100% zero-emission new car sales by 2035.

In June, the Trump administration signed three CRA resolutions overturning several of California’s major climate programs, including its Advanced Clean Cars II rules, the latest evolution of the state’s zero-emission vehicle rules. They remain unenforceable amid ongoing litigation, leaving California with only regulatory guidance and no binding mandates in effect for now.

“We are determined to defend our authority in court so we can reduce these harmful air emissions and continue to move the market forward,” Lindsay Buckley, a spokesperson for the California Air Resources Board, said Monday.

In response to Trump’s move, California’s top officials sued the federal government, asserting that the action violates federal law and undermines decades of climate progress, endangering California’s economy and the health of its residents.

“In the 50 years since the Clean Air Act was enacted, waivers have never been subject to the CRA,” Attorney General Rob Bonta’s news release stated in June.

“If California is prevented from enforcing these vehicle emission standards, it will result in the loss of significant economic and public health benefits, costing California taxpayers an estimated $45 billion in preventable health care costs.”

Implications of the Subpart RR Repeal for the CCUS Industry If finalized, the GHGRP repeal is likely to be particularly disruptive to the CCUS industry.
Current U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury) regulations rely on Subpart RR of the GHGRP for these purposes.
This approach could provide a pathway for Treasury to swiftly adjust to the Subpart RR repeal.","The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recently proposed to repeal virtually all of its Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP), 40 C.F.R. Part 98, which for the last 15 years has required large industrial sources to disclose their greenhouse gas emissions in a national database accessible to state and federal regulators, businesses, and the public. EPA’s proposed rule would end greenhouse gas (GHG) reporting requirements for all industries except for certain oil and natural gas facilities. For the oil and natural gas sector, EPA proposes to suspend GHG reporting for natural gas distribution facilities and suspend reporting for all other industry segments until 2034. EPA’s proposal will have significant implications for regulatory programs and stakeholders that rely on the GHGRP for verified GHG emissions data.

EPA established the GHGRP in 2009 in response to a directive from Congress in an appropriations act to establish “mandatory reporting of greenhouse gas emissions above appropriate thresholds in all sectors of the economy of the United States.”1 Since that time, EPA has required GHG emissions reporting from 47 source categories, including oil and gas, power plants, refineries, and chemical manufacturers, as well as fuel suppliers and carbon dioxide (CO2) injection sites. Facilities that emit at least 25,000 metric tons of CO2 equivalent report direct GHG emissions (scope 1 emissions), while fuel suppliers report the CO2 equivalent of their products when combusted by end-users (scope 3 emissions). The 2023 reporting year included around 8,000 facilities and suppliers accounting for roughly 85% to 90% of U.S. GHG emissions.

EPA developed this program pursuant to its information-gathering authority under Clean Air Act (CAA) Section 114, which allows EPA to seek “information necessary” for the development of, or determining compliance with, certain CAA regulatory programs. EPA has relied on the GHGRP to develop certain regulatory regimes, such as the CAA section 111 emissions standards for oil and natural gas facilities and the phasedown of hydrofluorocarbons under the AIM Act. EPA now asserts that section 114 requires a closer nexus between continuous reporting and statutory objectives than it previously stated. EPA thus argues that section 114 does not authorize the GHGRP as presently constituted. Alternatively, EPA asserts that the GHGRP is discretionary and, even if the program were lawful, it is no longer needed.

Reliance on the GHGRP extends beyond EPA regulatory schemes. Importantly, as discussed further below, entities seeking to claim a tax credit under Section 45Q of the Internal Revenue Code for carbon capture, utilization, and sequestration (CCUS) projects rely on the GHGRP to quantify the amount of credit for which such projects are eligible.

This Advisory focuses on potential implications of the proposed GHGRP repeal on the CCUS industry, as well as on oil and gas methane reduction efforts.

Implications of the Subpart RR Repeal for the CCUS Industry

If finalized, the GHGRP repeal is likely to be particularly disruptive to the CCUS industry. The primary federal incentive for CCUS projects is the Section 45Q tax credit, which was first enacted in 2008 and expanded under both the Trump administration in 2018 and the Biden administration in 2022. The Section 45Q tax credit can be claimed by taxpayers for capturing carbon oxides that are (1) injected into permanent geologic storage (CCS), (2) injected in an enhanced oil or gas recovery project (EOR/EGR), or (3) utilized in existing commercial markets. GHGRP Subpart RR is the mechanism for the EPA to verify that captured CO2 is geologically stored in a “secure” manner, which is a requirement for claiming the IRS’s 45Q tax credit. Current U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury) regulations rely on Subpart RR of the GHGRP for these purposes.

Section 45Q: Near-term Implications of Subpart RR Repeal

In the United States, permanent geologic storage projects must obtain a Class VI injection permit under the EPA Underground Injection Control (UIC) program. Obtaining a Class VI permit triggers reporting requirements under Subpart RR of the GHGRP. These requirements include reporting the quantity of carbon dioxide received, injected, produced, emitted, and sequestered; specific calculation methodologies and quality assurance for each such category of carbon dioxide; and the development of a monitoring, reporting, and verification plan that EPA makes publicly available on its website.

Under current Treasury regulations for the Section 45Q tax credit, Subpart RR is the only method available to demonstrate “secure geological storage” and quantify the amount of carbon dioxide securely stored in a Class VI-permitted CCS project. In the preamble to the regulations, Treasury explained that it “did not provide for an alternative to subpart RR reporting for UIC Class VI wells because all UIC Class VI wells are already subject to subpart RR reporting requirements.” As such, repeal of Subpart RR could leave Class VI projects unable to demonstrate secure geological storage — and therefore unable to claim a Section 45Q tax credit — unless Treasury adopts the Subpart RR as currently codified into a freestanding method or adopts an alternative mechanism.

EOR/EGR projects operating under a Class II permit have more flexibility than Class VI operators. Recognizing that not all Class II operators are required to report under Subpart RR, the Treasury regulations allow such operators to use the international standard CSA/ANSI ISO 27916:20192 (the same ISO used in the Subpart VV regulations that were added to the GHGRP in 2024) as an alternative method. EOR/EGR projects should therefore still have a pathway available to continue claiming a Section 45Q tax credit even if the GHGRP repeal is finalized.

Section 45Q: Longer-Term Alternatives to the GHGRP

Stakeholders are considering a number of potential options to replace the GHGRP’s role in claiming the Section 45Q tax credit. The level of disruption that EPA’s proposal would inflict on the CCUS industry will depend on how swiftly Treasury acts to provide an alternative to GHGRP. To expedite the process, Treasury could issue interim guidance to address the period between the GHGRP repeal and the adoption of updated regulations.

Of course, EPA could choose to carve out Subpart RR from the repeal of the broader GHGRP. EPA could base this, for example, on the significant investment-backed reliance interests of investors in the CCUS industry and the close relationship between carbon capture technology, which is fundamentally designed to control air emissions, and the CAA’s purposes.

Alternatively, EPA could transition certain aspects of Subpart RR into other regulatory programs, such as the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA), which houses the Class VI permitting program for CO2 underground injection wells. EPA would have to determine that it has legal authority to administer the Subpart RR requirements under the SDWA. Moreover, under either of these alternatives, EPA would have to be interested in maintaining its role in validating and managing emissions data. These EPA approaches would also require coordination between Treasury and EPA on Section 45Q, which may be less efficient than alternatives implemented by Treasury alone.

Treasury also has a number of tools available to fill the gap created by EPA’s repeal. For example, Treasury could, through a variety of mechanisms, incorporate by reference the Subpart RR methodologies in effect prior to repeal. Doing so would essentially freeze the current EPA requirements in place, and could replace the role currently filled by EPA by requiring Section 45Q claimants to obtain approvals from independent third-party auditors evaluating the reporting plans. This approach could provide a pathway for Treasury to swiftly adjust to the Subpart RR repeal.

Another option could be to adopt an international reporting standard, similar to the one that Treasury currently allows for EOR/EGR projects, i.e., ISO 27916, which is inapplicable to most Class VI projects, because this particular standard does not apply to CO2 sequestration purely for purposes of CO2 storage. However, there is a similar standard issued by the same body, ISO 27914, that could apply to most Class VI projects and is currently undergoing a technical revision, expecting to be released in the coming months, to add quantification and verification standards. Once released, ISO 27914 could potentially be adopted by Treasury as an alternative to Subpart RR, perhaps with certain modifications or enhancements provided by Treasury.

Other approaches could involve reliance on state reporting programs. Treasury considered and rejected this approach in 2021, noting that variability between state programs would increase the administrative burden on Treasury. Variability between state programs can also increase complexity and cost of compliance for project proponents. State programs, however, have continued to develop and grow in sophistication since 2021 and could be better harmonized. In addition, stakeholders opposed to EPA’s repeal have cautioned that shifting from a standardized, nationwide annual reporting framework, such as the GHGRP, to an assortment of voluntary or third-party reporting can make it more difficult for investors to assess performance, increasing the perceived risk and thereby increasing the cost of capital for projects.

Implications of EPA’s Proposed Suspension and Partial Repeal of Subpart W Reporting for the Oil and Natural Gas Industry

For the oil and natural gas sector that is required to report GHG emissions under Subpart W of the GHGRP, EPA is proposing to suspend until 2034 the reporting requirements for industry segments subject to the methane waste emissions charge (WEC) under section 136 of the CAA. Accordingly, EPA is eliminating the reporting obligations for the one industry segment not subject to the WEC, natural gas distribution.

Oil and natural gas facilities will still need to report on GHG emissions in states that have adopted their own reporting requirements, several of which incorporate the reporting methodologies established under the GHGRP. However, suspending Subpart W reporting may complicate the ability of operators to demonstrate methane emissions reductions in line with corporate sustainability goals or to meet certain methane intensity requirements in other jurisdictions. For example, EU methane regulations will require importers, including those sourcing from U.S. producers, to provide data on methane intensity and ultimately meet certain emissions standards; Subpart W provided a convenient and consistent option for such reporting. In the absence of Subpart W reporting, operators may have to rely on voluntary GHG accounting and reporting mechanisms and/or state reporting programs as they implement methane emissions reduction measures.

While oil and gas facilities will not need to report on GHG emissions until 2034 under the proposed rule, those facilities are still subject to the CAA section 111 methane emissions standards for new or modified sources and emissions guidelines for states to implement with respect to existing sources. A recent Interim Final Rule issued by EPA partially delayed compliance deadlines for the section 111 rules. Operators of new or modified facilities are still currently subject to fugitive emissions standards, such as leak detection and repair. EPA is considering revisions to the section 111 methane rules, and a proposed rulemaking is anticipated before the end of the year.

Companies like Voltpost are taking charging to new heights — somewhat literally — by mounting the hardware 10 feet off the ground on streetlamp posts to enable curbside charging, and remove the charging devices from the temptation of vandals and the more pedestrian obstacle of cables becoming tripping hazards.

Drivers activate a session with Voltpost via the mobile app, Jeffrey Prosserman, the company’s CEO and co-founder, said.

“Which sends a command to the Voltpost charger to release the cable,” he said in an email. “The retractable cable mechanism extends the cable downward. This is designed to provide up to 25 feet of cable to reach the vehicle’s charging port.”

The Voltpost Air, as the devices are known, is part of a pilot project at the MADE Bush Terminal in Brooklyn, N.Y., where it is due to be operational by the end of the year, officials said.

Voltpost’s more conventional curbside charging technology has been deployed in Illinois, Michigan, California and other states.

Chargers mounted to streetlamps are an obvious way to serve the many users of street parking, and another attempt to make charging infrastructure a ubiquitous part of the urban landscape — which is what consumers want to see more of, industry watchers said.

They also want chargers that work, according to a new report from ChargerHelp, which provides maintenance for the charging industry and concluded one-third of charging sessions fail on their first attempt, frustrating drivers and blunting EV enthusiasm.

Reasons behind the failures include a mix of confusion around how to use the devices, navigating glitchy apps, and aging equipment which is generally more prone to failure, Kameale Terry, ChargerHelp CEO, said.

“First, the charging experience has to be simpler for drivers,” Terry said via email, indicating this includes better signage and more user-friendly technology.

“There also needs to be consistent practices for firmware updates,” Terry said. “When it comes to aging infrastructure, swapping out a charger or refreshing a site might solve a short-term problem, but it doesn’t address the deeper issue: Technology moves faster than most charging site deployments.”

Today, roughly 64 percent of Americans live within 2 miles of a public EV charger, according to the Pew Research Center, with the number of charging locations more than doubling since 2020.

Lingering concerns related to range or the availability of charging locations continue to plague the U.S. market, even though vehicle range and the number of chargers coming online have both steadily grown, Ronak Amin, global product marketing lead for HERE Technologies, said last month, talking about a new report by HERE technologies and SBD Automotive examining the U.S. EV market.

Improving the charging experience is a key component in increasing the comfort level U.S. consumers have with the technology, Terry said, but it will require “better technology, smarter processes, and accountability across the ecosystem.”

“Overall, we’re incredibly optimistic about the EV transition. The progress in technology, investment, and adoption is real,” she said. “But that optimism has to be matched with honesty.”

To increase their convenience factor, Voltpost officials said the company will soon let users begin a charging session from a website landing page, eliminating the need to download a separate app.

While the vehicles have proven to be environmentally friendly and favorable, they pose new challenges for first responders.

When fire stations get the call that they will be dealing with an EV fire, they know they might be extinguishing the flames for a while.

On July 1, the Cortlandville Fire Department found itself on the end of a similar call.

“That one came in as a regular vehicle fire, a car fire on 81,” Fire Chief at the Cortlandville Fire Department Mike Biviano said. “As we were en route, they started updating: ‘This is believed to be an electric vehicle, hybrid fire.’ Which then prompted a little bit bigger response from us.”

The Moyers Corners Fire Department experienced a similar situation on October 12. Firefighters spent nearly two hours putting out an EV fire in the parking lot of the IHOP in Clay.

A regular car fire may require a crew to bring out an engine and a tanker full of water. But an EV fire often requires more resources.

“They take a lot more water to put out,” Biviano said. “You get into an electric vehicle fire, you’re talking thousands of gallons of water.”

Because of an EV’s lithium batteries, Biviano said they burn at extremely high temperatures and at a faster rate.

“It just takes a lot more water to put those out,” he said.

If you are an EV owner and your vehicle happens to catch on fire, Biviano said you should respond differently than if you are dealing with a regular engine.

“If you have a small fire extinguisher, give it one shot and get away,” he said.

If that doesn’t put out the fire, he recommends you get out as quickly and safely as possible, put as much distance between yourself and the vehicle as you can, and call 911.

“Do not put yourself at risk,” Biviano said.",https://www.localsyr.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/63/2025/10/CORTLANDVILLE-FIRE-TTVO_WSYR9fc8_146.mxf_.00_00_14_20.Still001.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-10-13 19:02:15.838396

SkyNRG’s facility will convert gaseous feedstocks into sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel using chemical processes.
Once operating, the facility will produce an estimated 50 million gallons of sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel annually.
While federal policy toward some clean or renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, has soured, sustainable aviation fuel has largely been spared similar treatment.
But the bill extended a tax credit for producing clean fuels including sustainable aviation fuel.","A Dutch company planning a sustainable aviation fuel production facility southeast of the Tri-Cities has cleared an important regulatory hurdle for the project.

State Department of Ecology officials in early September determined that SkyNRG’s manufacturing facility, being pursued by its North American unit SkyNRG Americas, would not create significant environmental impacts. The agency’s determination still set requirements for the company and project, from air and water quality precautions to mitigating reduction of habitat for ferruginous hawks.

But company officials said in a statement to the Tri-Cities Area Journal of Business that Ecology’s decision is a critical milestone and they will continue to work with state and local stakeholders so the project continues to move forward.

“This brings SkyNRG closer to realizing a first-of-its-kind facility in the U.S. that will deliver domestic sustainable aviation fuel while advancing innovation and economic opportunity to Eastern Washington and across Washington,” said Nick Zollman of SkyNRG Americas in a statement.

SkyNRG’s facility will convert gaseous feedstocks into sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel using chemical processes.

Once operating, the facility will produce an estimated 50 million gallons of sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel annually. It already has agreements in place with those wanting to buy its fuels.

SkyNRG has not released details about construction costs for the facility. Company officials have said construction will create up to 600 jobs and the facility itself about 100 jobs once production begins in 2029.

While federal policy toward some clean or renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, has soured, sustainable aviation fuel has largely been spared similar treatment.

Congress’ passage of H.R. 1, the so-called One Big Beautiful Bill, scaled back credits for sustainable energy that were instituted a few years ago, such as those supporting the purchase of new and used electric vehicles or installing solar panels on homes.

But the bill extended a tax credit for producing clean fuels including sustainable aviation fuel. The credit initially went through 2027 but now extends through 2029.

The Walla Walla County site provides access to transportation networks and potential synergy with other regional efforts to harness agricultural waste for energy production and other industrial purposes.

Washington State University is globally the top contributing organization to scientific literature in the sustainable aviation fuel field, based on an analysis of articles, papers, editorials and news items published between 2001-23.

Joshua Heyne, director of the Bioproducts, Sciences and Engineering Laboratory at WSU Tri-Cities and co-director of the WSU-Pacific Northwest National Laboratory Bioproducts Institute, was the most cited author.

The SkyNRG project is the one the state has thrown support behind. It received a $1.5 million grant from the state Department of Commerce, as part of the Governor’s Economic Development Strategic Reserve Fund.

“This project aligns with our strategic growth priorities around clean technology and innovation,” said Joe Nguyen, director of the state Department of Commerce, in the statement announcing the grant. “In addition to furthering Washington’s leadership in clean energy and sustainable aviation, it creates family-wage manufacturing jobs that strengthen the local economy and community.”

SkyNRG has had to adjust its original plan to move forward. According to state documents, the company moved the facility to a different area of the business park than originally planned. The new site, located farther from the Columbia River, will have fewer environmental impacts.

Ecology’s recent determination also requires SkyNRG to make improvements to the intersection of Boise Cascade Road and Highway 12 if current state plans to widen and realign the highway don’t proceed. That is a possibility, as state and county officials propose further breaking up the next phase of expanding and rerouting the key route between the Tri-Cities and Walla Walla.

Zollman said the company is grateful for its partners as it looks to next steps.

“Important work lies ahead as we advance a project designed specifically to meet the benchmarks set by state and local partners,” he said.",https://www.tricitiesbusinessnews.com/ext/resources/Focus/Construction%202025/Project-Wigeon-2025-layout-v2.jpg?height=635&t=1760371759&width=1200,N,,2025-10-13 21:59:11.804696

This trade conflict began not in the fields of Saskatchewan or the ports of Vancouver, but in the politics of the global auto industry. In July, Canada joined the United States and the European Union in imposing 100% tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, citing concerns over industrial overcapacity, state subsidies and unfair competition. It was, in essence, an act of solidarity — a symbolic gesture to align with western allies rather than a measure grounded in Canada’s domestic economic reality.

After all, Chinese-made EVs make up less than 2% of vehicle sales in Canada. There was no surge threatening Canadian automakers. The tariff served a diplomatic purpose, not an industrial one.

Beijing’s response, however, has been deeply economic — and devastating. In March, China retaliated by imposing 100% tariffs on canola oil, canola meal and peas, along with 25% tariffs on pork and seafood. Then in August, it escalated further by slapping a 75.8% anti-dumping duty on Canadian canola seed — effectively closing the door on one of Canada’s most important export markets.

The financial fallout has been severe. Within two weeks of the August announcement, Canadian farmers were estimated to have lost $140 million. Canola futures dropped roughly $40 per tonne and the Canola Council of Canada projects total damages could reach $1.5 billion this year alone.

Before this dispute, China purchased over $5 billion worth of Canadian canola products annually, accounting for nearly 40% of our total exports in that category. That trade has now all but vanished. Prairie producers are scrambling to redirect shipments to Japan, Mexico and the United Arab Emirates — but at heavily discounted prices.

STRAINED ECONOMIC SECTOR

Meanwhile, the sector’s broader economics are already strained. In 2024, net cash income for Canadian farms fell by 15% to $19.7 billion, while interest expenses surged almost 29%. Add tariffs that block billions in exports and the math simply doesn’t work.

Ottawa has responded with limited support: Higher AgriStability coverage (from 80% to 90%), expanded interest-free cash advances and loan deferrals through Farm Credit Canada. These programs offer temporary liquidity, but do not restore lost markets. They keep farmers afloat, but don’t help them sell their crops.

Canada’s stance makes little sense. The country is defending a fledgling EV policy that protects virtually no domestic manufacturing base, while undermining one of its most globally competitive sectors — agriculture. It is, frankly, a case of policy misalignment: Protecting an industry that barely exists, while punishing one that feeds the world.

And now the way out is staring us in the face. China’s message through its ambassador is clear: Remove your EV tariffs and we will remove ours. For Beijing to make such a conditional offer publicly is extraordinary. In diplomatic language, that’s as close as one gets to a negotiated exit without a formal agreement.

By refusing to engage, Ottawa is not defending Canadian sovereignty — it is sacrificing Canadian prosperity. Every day this dispute drags on, farmers lose income, communities lose stability and Canada loses credibility as a reliable trade partner.

The potential upside of a policy shift is enormous. Dropping the EV tariffs would cost Canada virtually nothing — the affected imports represent a rounding error in national trade data — but it could immediately reopen up to $5 billion in annual canola exports and relieve pressure on the broader agri-food sector.

Canada’s role in global trade has always been built on pragmatism, not ideology. Our competitive advantage lies in feeding the world, not in fighting symbolic battles over industries we don’t have.

Farmers don’t need political theatre. They need access to markets. Ottawa’s duty is not to make gestures, but to make sense.

China has made its position clear. Now it’s Canada’s turn to act — with reason, not rhetoric.

VW’s hybrid push is not simply cosmetic.
From the Beetle to the Golf, to derivatives like the Bus, VW built its identity on modular, scalable architecture.","(TestMiles) – Volkswagen’s journey in America has always been a dance between heritage and innovation. From the humble Beetle to the bold ID series, VW’s product planning philosophy under the guidance of leaders like Serban Boldea remains grounded in creating value, platform efficiency, and brand consistency. In today’s climate of electrification, trade volatility, and consumer demand for SUVs and hybrids, VW’s legacy thinking may be its strongest weapon.

Why does this matter right now?

We’re at a pivot in the industry: hybrid adoption is surging as a bridge between combustion and full-electric models. According to Automotive Research, 77 percent of U.S. repair shops have already seen more hybrid vehicles in their bays. Meanwhile, VW has publicly committed to HEVs as part of a premium reorientation in markets like the U.S.

Combine that with looming trade pressures, software differentiation, and supply chain shifts, and VW’s product planning decisions could determine whether it leads or lags. The lessons from the Beetle, Golf, and Bus still echo today in decisions about shared platforms and product spacing.

How does it compare to rivals?

Rival brands, Toyota, Honda, Ford, lean heavily on hybrid or full-electric transitions with strong economies of scale. VW’s advantage lies in its platform legacy: VW’s MQB architecture already underpins SUVs like the Atlas, enabling flexibility in body styles and powertrain options. Boldea outlined how moving the firewall forward and optimizing interior packaging gave the Atlas a roomy cabin on relatively compact footprints.

However, rivals often enjoy more aggressive branding and marketing in the U.S. EV space. Tesla, Ford’s EV push, and Hyundai’s aggressive hybrid/EV rollout put VW in a competitive catch-up mode. VW’s focus on internal platform consistency is a strength, but some critics argue it’s too conservative in software and marketing muscle.

VW’s hybrid push is not simply cosmetic. The automaker has said it will prioritize conventional hybrid models rather than plug-in hybrids in the U.S., reducing weight, complexity, and cost burdens. That decision contrasts with many rivals who are doubling down on PHEVs or pure BEVs.

Who is this for, and who should skip it?

If you’re a VW fan, a buyer weighing between hybrid SUVs, or someone watching how legacy automakers fight for relevance, you’ll find this deeply relevant. Analysts, engineers, and platform nerds will appreciate the behind-the-scenes reasoning about space utilization, cost control, and brand heritage.

If, however, you’re only looking for quick EV comparisons or short-term deals, this is not your how-to pick guide. This is about strategy over shiny features.

What is the long-term significance?

Platform thinking is VW’s core competitive moat. From the Beetle to the Golf, to derivatives like the Bus, VW built its identity on modular, scalable architecture. Today, the leap into hybrid and electric architectures must preserve that DNA or risk diluting the brand.

Nostalgia plays a role. Boldea referenced the original Beetle and Bus when discussing retro revivals like the ID Buzz, which mimics classic proportions thanks to its EV layout. Yet, recreating those proportions under modern safety rules is only viable in electric architecture. The Bus or a revived Thing with an ICE setup would compromise form and function.

Volkswagen’s broader group strategy aims to balance strong software, electrification, and platform resilience through 2035. That means shared cell design, digital ecosystems, and a leaner product stack. Their “Transform 2025+” roadmap underscores the intention to reimagine brand positioning while leveraging core.

The hybrid bridge, platform synergy, and carefully chosen retro revivals are pieces in a larger chess game. Time will tell whether VW’s disciplined ethos beats rivals’ aggressive gambits.",https://www.louisianafirstnews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/80/2025/10/ID.Buzz_.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-10-13 21:00:41.722116

Federal workers are preparing to auction off logging rights in three national forests in Oregon, despite the government shutdown. That is because the workers were deemed essential after President Trump issued an executive order earlier this year expanding U.S. timber production. Now, Trump also promised to reverse what's called the roadless rule, a ban on logging in almost 60 million acres of national forests. Here's NPR's Kirk Siegler.

KIRK SIEGLER, BYLINE: While still steady, Oregon's timber industry is a fraction of what it was back in the boom times when a lot more trees were being cut on U.S. Forest Service land. For the last two decades, most of the logs rolling into sawmills like this have been cut off private land. In the old timber town of Cottage Grove, Sean Smith runs the family owned Starfire Lumber. He says Trump's push to revive logging on public forests is generally well-received, but there's an asterisk.

SEAN SMITH: I mean, I think his heart is in the right place. But when you consider the moving parts...

SIEGLER: Mills like his are feeling pinched right now, not because they can't get enough logs, but because lumber prices are low. Opening up more public lands to logging could eventually help his margins, but he doubts that'll happen fast. And today's environmental laws mean timber sales take more time to plan, or they get tied up in court.

SMITH: When you consider that you have not only land management agencies but also fish and wildlife agencies that have to sign off on things...

SIEGLER: He says the president can't just sign an executive order and expect the woods around here to get cut down. Congress must pass a long-term forest policy.

SMITH: I mean, we don't live in a dictatorship. And I, for one, I'm OK with that (laughter). I hope most Americans are.

SIEGLER: Smith adds that so many people have left the timber industry since the 1990s after the notorious timber wars, when the endangered spotted owl led to the forest service dramatically curtailing timber sales on public land. Some 400 mills across the northwest closed, a loss of 35,000 jobs. And even if there was a new boom, many mill owners say it'd be hard to find enough people in rural Oregon who want to work in sawmills these days. Alex Owen (ph) started at Starfire in 2011 and worked his way up to sawmill supervisor.

ALEX OWEN: For me, I like the high pace. But with all the internet jobs out there today, a lot of the younger kids don't want to do the manual labor that this requires.

SIEGLER: President Trump is banking on that changing. His executive order on expanding American timber production says foreign lumber imports have stifled job creation. And further, Trump officials say reversing the 2001 roadless rule will return common sense to forest management. But right now in Oregon, it's widely known that the forest service doesn't have enough money to maintain its existing roads and isn't even meeting its timber harvest targets in forests that are already developed.

CHANDRA LEGUE: It's really that backlog that can be capitalized on without entering these pristine areas that have never been cut before.

SIEGLER: Huge ferns carpet the understory of a roadless forest that Chandra LeGue is hiking through near the college town of Eugene.

LEGUE: We are walking through a forest of western hemlock and Douglas fir.

SIEGLER: Environmentalists like LeGue of Oregon Wild also point to mechanization. So even if more forests are open to logging, there may not be many new jobs.

LEGUE: You know, this area, yeah, at one time, timber was king in western Oregon. Our economy has diversified immensely.

SIEGLER: It's likely national environmental groups will sue if the administration fast-tracks repealing the roadless rule without the required environmental analysis. But for Nick Smith with the Portland-based trade group American Forest Resource Council, reversing that rule isn't about a timber boom. It's more about cutting red tape for smaller thinning and fire prevention projects.

NICK SMITH: We do not mean industrial-style clear cuts, but the real work that needs to be done to restore these forests and make them more resilient to wildfire and climate change.

SIEGLER: But right now, everything - wildfires, workforce or environment pressures - feels like it's being overshadowed by a bigger unknown, the economy.

(SOUNDBITE OF TOOL SAWING)

SIEGLER: Back at Starfire, owner Sean Smith made the tough decision the other day to stop bringing in any new logs into his yard. Lumber prices remain soft due to sluggish home construction. A mill down the road just closed.

SMITH: The cynical observation you often hear is the price of everything goes up except lumber.

SIEGLER: For now, his mill is running full tilt, one shift a day. And Smith is hoping the drop in demand is just a typical seasonal thing going into winter.

Aluminium has long been a mainstay of bicycle manufacturing; it's a lightweight, durable, and relatively affordable material. You’ll find it in everything from entry-level commuters to premium race road bikes, and it's widely used in components like cranks, handlebars, and seat posts. It's lauded as both an affordable and relatively sustainable material. But beyond noting the fact that aluminium is recyclable, the cycling industry has long been quiet about the supply chain and the sustainability credentials behind the material.

Despite its technical recyclability, aluminium’s environmental impact is heavily front-loaded. The mining, refining, and smelting processes that produce raw aluminium are deeply energy-intensive, and unless that energy comes from renewables, the carbon footprint is massive. Although closed-loop recycling is theoretically possible, it remains rare in practice, especially for products like bike frames that have to comply with safety standards.

It's also taken decades of using this material for the cycling industry to finally have a closer look at its environmental impact. Trek, among others, has made it a focus in its sustainability efforts, and admitted that the metal is a key hotspot in its emissions.

Joel Demeritt, Trek's sustainability lead, told Escape Collective that up until identifying that issue, Trek's sustainability efforts were mostly focused on plastics, packaging, and renewable energy at the manufacturing level. ""We realised after doing [an analysis] that we would never hit our goals without addressing metals,"" Demeritt explained.

What Trek has identified applies to the wider cycling industry. The following is a closer look at how aluminium becomes a bike, a handlebar, or a crankset – and how companies are trying to make the process less damaging. Escape Collective spoke with engineers, product managers and sustainability leads at Trek, SRAM, Merida, Standert and other brands, and consulted the Outdoor Industry Association's Aluminium Guidebook to detail how the bicycle industry operates as part of the much larger global metals economy.

The complicated origins of aluminium

""Just the production of aluminium raw material is about 45% of our carbon footprint,"" Nick Myhre, sustainability and strategy lead at SRAM, admitted. And SRAM is far from being alone with that figure in the cycling industry.

The Aluminium Guidebook and the wider aluminium industry point to similar figures; emissions from electricity during smelting account for over 71% of aluminium's total lifecycle emissions, and the rest come from the refinement and anode production. Despite this, brands have historically paid little attention to the upstream emissions embedded in what is often dubbed an eco-friendly material. Much of that is down to the energy-intensive manufacturing process that aluminium goes through.

The Cybertruck was meant to signal Tesla’s next era — a company moving beyond sedans and SUVs into America’s most profitable vehicle class.","The Cybertruck was supposed to be Tesla’s flex: a stainless-steel symbol of Elon Musk’s unflinching futurism. But instead, the pickup’s luster is continuing to wear thin.

According to Cox Automotive’s latest EV sales report, Tesla sold just 5,385 Cybertrucks in the third quarter, down 62.6% from a year earlier. The decline came as the broader U.S. EV market posted its strongest quarter on record, with sales up nearly 30% to more than 438,000 vehicles. Ford sold almost twice as many electric F-150 Lightning trucks in the same quarter, while even Chevrolet’s fledgling Silverado EV and Rivian’s R1T gained ground.

The Cybertruck comparison is slightly distorted by timing — Q3 2024 captured the truck’s early ramp — but even adjusting for that, deliveries have slowed, and orders have thinned. And the sales drop came even as buyers rushed to lock in federal EV tax credits before they expired in late September, a policy boost that's now in the rearview mirror.

Tesla still commands about 41% of the EV market, but its share has slipped from nearly half last year — and the company’s stainless-steel pickup is the biggest drag on its lead. The company’s core models still move volume, but its more ambitious projects — from the Cybertruck to the long-promised robotaxi — are proving harder to scale than to hype.

When Musk unveiled the Cybertruck back in 2019, its $39,990 price tag, Blade Runner aesthetic, and millions of preorders looked like a dare to Detroit. But nearly six years later, the sticker shock has flipped. The cheapest version now starts above $60,000, and early adopters are discovering that the attention-grabbing angles don’t make for a particularly practical ride.

The Model Y remains the country’s best-selling EV by far, yet Tesla’s total share has fallen eight points in a year as rivals finally scale up. What was once a moat of innovation is now crowded with well-funded competition, and the Cybertruck’s sharp edges (and fit and finish issues) are beginning to look like a distraction.

The Cybertruck was meant to signal Tesla’s next era — a company moving beyond sedans and SUVs into America’s most profitable vehicle class. Instead, the model is revealing Tesla’s limits. Demand elsewhere may remain robust, but the truck is exposing how hard it is to act like a disruptor once you’ve become the incumbent.","https://qz.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=300,quality=85,format=auto/https://assets.qz.com/media/GettyImages-2232243084.jpg",N,,2025-10-13 18:03:10.340793

When there is excess electricity from nearby power plants, it is used to pump water from the lower to the upper reservoir.
By transforming existing natural features into energy assets, the U.S. could significantly boost its renewable energy capacity while preserving ecological balance.
As we continue to search for sustainable energy solutions, the idea of converting lakes into power plants presents an intriguing possibility.
This approach not only leverages existing natural resources but also aligns with the global push towards renewable energy.","In recent years, a revolutionary concept has emerged that could significantly alter our landscapes and energy systems: transforming lakes into colossal power plants. This idea builds on the technology of pumped storage, which has been gaining attention as a way to enhance renewable energy capacity. Unlike traditional hydroelectric dams that can disrupt ecosystems and communities, this method uses existing lakes and reservoirs to store and generate energy. As the demand for sustainable energy solutions grows, this innovative approach could play a crucial role in meeting our energy needs while minimizing environmental impact.

Transforming Lakes: The New Face of Hydropower

The concept of converting lakes into power plants is not entirely new but has seen renewed interest due to its potential for sustainable energy production. Traditional hydropower has long relied on massive dams, which, despite their efficiency, often lead to significant ecological and social disruptions. Instead, the emerging technology known as pumped storage aims to utilize the natural geography of lakes and reservoirs, reducing the need for new dams.

This system involves two reservoirs at different elevations. When there is excess electricity from nearby power plants, it is used to pump water from the lower to the upper reservoir. This process effectively “charges” the system like a battery. When energy demand peaks, the stored water is released back down through turbines to generate electricity. This innovative approach harnesses the gravitational power of water without the need for large-scale infrastructure projects, making it a more environmentally friendly option.

Pumped storage is not a novel concept, but its relevance is growing as the world seeks reliable renewable energy sources. As wind and solar power continue to expand, the need for energy storage solutions becomes more pressing. Pumped storage offers a viable answer to the intermittency problem associated with these renewable sources. By storing excess energy during periods of low demand, it ensures a steady supply when energy needs spike.

Remarkably, some of the largest pumped storage systems can supply enough power for two million U.S. homes for an hour. While China has been at the forefront of renewable energy growth, including pumped storage, the United States is also exploring its potential. The ability to store and release energy efficiently is crucial for transitioning to a low-carbon future, making pumped storage an attractive option for many regions.

Rethinking Hydropower: Run-of-River Plants

While pumped storage is gaining traction, other types of hydropower technology are also being explored. Run-of-river hydropower plants provide a less invasive alternative to traditional dams. These systems are built on rivers without creating large reservoirs, relying instead on the natural flow of water to generate electricity. This approach minimizes the environmental impact and reduces the risk of catastrophic failures in seismically active areas.

Particularly prevalent in mountainous regions like Nepal, run-of-river plants offer a sustainable way to harness hydropower without the adverse effects associated with large dams. This adaptability makes it possible to implement hydropower solutions in diverse geographical settings, expanding the potential for renewable energy generation worldwide.

The Future of Energy: Potential Projects in the United States

In the United States, the potential for lake-based power plants is being explored through ambitious projects. One such initiative involves diverting water from the Great Lakes to create a lower-altitude reservoir. This setup would generate electricity from the gravitational flow of water, similar to the pumped storage concept.

Although the project faced delays due to the pandemic, there is renewed interest in resuming and expanding these efforts. By transforming existing natural features into energy assets, the U.S. could significantly boost its renewable energy capacity while preserving ecological balance. The success of these projects would mark a significant step forward in sustainable energy development, potentially serving as a model for other regions around the world.

As we continue to search for sustainable energy solutions, the idea of converting lakes into power plants presents an intriguing possibility. This approach not only leverages existing natural resources but also aligns with the global push towards renewable energy. As these projects gain momentum, the question remains: can this innovative technology be the key to achieving a sustainable energy future while maintaining ecological harmony?

Interior said Oct. 10 that it cancelled a key approval for the Esmeralda project, to be located about 30 miles west of Tonopah, Nev., on department owned land, in an agreement with firms developing its seven contiguous sections. Together, they are set to produce 6.2 GW of clean power and be a leading energy supplier in the state. The ""programmatic review"" action, quietly taken and noted in an agency website statement, followed the Trump order to freeze clean energy project permits. Interior released the Esmeralda project draft environmental review early this year and had promised final approval, the record of decision, in July. Among key project developers are NextEra Energy, Invenergy, Leeward Energy and ConnectGen.

Interior did not cancel the entire 62,000-acre project, a department spokesperson told media, but directed developers to resubmit parcels for new approval separately “to more effectively analyze potential impacts,” if they choose to continue development.

Among developers responding to media, a NextEra Energy spokesperson said on Oct. 10 the firm was “in the early stage of development and remains committed to pursuing our project’s comprehensive environmental analysis by working closely with [the department.] A spokesperson for Leeward Energy said it had “no information to share regarding the project update.”

Among other administration rule changes mandated in July, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum now has to personally approve all “environmentally damaging” solar and wind energy projects on public lands, requiring the department to consider “capacity density” when evaluating projects, which observers said could be a barrier due to their space needs.

At the same time, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin said he was ending the $7 billion national Solar for All program that offered states grants to develop solar energy for low-income households. In September, the U.S. Dept. of Agriculture said it would no longer fund solar projects on productive farmland, a policy change from the Biden administration. Earlier in October, a group of solar installation firms and nonprofits, and the Rhode Island AFL-CIO, sued EPA in federal court in Providence, R.I., claiming the agency action was illegal.

In an Aug. 4 letter to Burgum, Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo (R) raised concern about economic impacts to growing state industries such as data centers and mining if solar energy projects are curtailed or delayed. Nevada ranked fourth in the U.S. last year in total electricity generation from utility- and small-scale solar resources, comprising 31% of the state's total power generation, said the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Ben Norris, vice president of regulatory affairs for the Solar Energy Industries Association, said Interior needs to further clarify “its apparent decision to abruptly cancel these solar projects in the late stages of the review process.”

Despite Esmeralda's clean energy appeal, some environmental advocates opposed it for its impacts to a pristine area. Advocacy group Basin and Range Watch and others sued Interior in May for not considering Esmeralda Seven in its environmental review of Greenlink West, a 472-mile, multibillion-dollar transmission line from the Reno area to Las Vegas to move energy from rural areas to Nevada urban centers. While that project's federal approvals are also at risk, NV Energy is moving ahead to build the project, said a spokeswoman.

Opponents speculated whether Esmeralda Seven's developers would actually resubmit applications after “tariffs and roadblocks set by the administration"" add new layers of complication, said one. Shaaron Netherton, executive director of Friends of Nevada Wilderness, said the cancelled review “will be an opportunity moving forward to find better sites for solar development.”

DOE Eyes Billions More in Funding Cuts

The Esmeralda reversal comes as a list developed by the U.S. Energy Dept. of hundreds of clean power project federal grant recipients targeted for termination became public through media pickup—possibly totaling an added $12 billion beyond $7.56 billion the agency already announced earlier this month would terminate.

The group includes some 600 grant recipient names, with about half on the earlier announced list and total funding of nearly $24 billion, according to the document. Media speculate the list was leaked, with possible intent to use the cuts as leverage.

On the list was funding for carbon capture projects in development by oil giants ExxonMobil and Occidental as well as hundreds of millions provided to electric vehicle manufacturing sites built or under construction by Ford Motor Co., General Motors, Stellantis and Volvo.

Canada, however, appears to be is moving to capture carbon capture market share the U.S. rejects. Montreal-based technology startup Deep Sky said on Oct. 9 that it will build what it said would be one of the world’s largest direct air capture projects, an estimated $500-million plant in Manitoba at a not-yet chosen site. Set to start construction next year, the facility would be able to remove 500,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide annually from the atmosphere, Deep Sky said. No contractor selection was announced. ""Canada has the opportunity to become the carbon removal capital of the world, and capture the jobs and economic opportunity that will come with it,” said Alex Petre, Deep Sky CEO.

Also on the Trump hit list are new funding cuts that could total more than $4.5 billion, to five U.S. hydrogen hubs, including those focused on deriving the fuel from natural gas, in addition to two in California and Pacific Northwest focused on renewables-based hydrogen that lost $2.2 billion previously.

Those now facing cuts are: HyVelocity hub located on the Gulf Coast; the Midwest and mid-Atlantic hubs; the Appalachian hub in West Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania; and the Heartland hub in the Dakotas, Montana, Wisconsin and Minnesota. Burgum had supported the latter as North Dakota governor, while Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) previously voiced concern about Trump cuts to the Appalachian hub's $925 million in federal funding.

DOE officials have not officially confirmed specific cuts. ""We have been unable to verify the documents referenced. No determinations have been made other than what has been previously announced,"" DOE chief spokesperson Ben Dietderich told ENR. The agency ""continues to conduct an individualized and thorough review of financial awards made by the previous administration.""",https://www.enr.com/ext/resources/2025/10/12/BLM.ESMERALDA.-SOLARSITE.jpeg?height=635&t=1760378105&width=1200,N,,2025-10-13 17:00:52.172737

Emily Flippen: The landscape of commerce is turning increasingly social. EV demand has been dampening, and are tariffs actually working? We'll discuss today on Motley Fool Money.

I'm Emily Flippen. Today, I'm joined by analysts Jason Hall and Dan Caplinger to discuss how the sale of TikTok in the United States could change the way we shop here at the start of Prime Day, as well as expectations for demand for electric vehicles now that domestic EV tax credits have expired. But first, I think it's worth taking a deeper look at whether or not we can call tariffs a success. I suspect all of our listeners are already familiar with the tariffs that the Trump administration has sought to implement over the course of the past year. Most empirical evidence says that, generally speaking, tariffs don't spur economic growth. In fact, most economists and investors speculated that they would actually cause profits to drop, stocks to fall, consumer spending to ease, and inflation to rise. But so far, it doesn't really seem like that's been the case. In fact, it's really been the opposite. Stocks are up. The economy has been really resilient, and inflation does seem to be moderating. Jason, when you look at this picture in terms of the economic policies we're seeing here, is it too early to call tariffs a relative success?

Jason Hall: I think if you're talking about the administration's goal of boosting US manufacturing, it's definitely way too early. So far, the only industries that have really been helped are the ones where there's already an entrenched base. You think about metals production, steel manufacturing. They've basically gotten a free license to increase their prices based on the tariffs that are in place on imports in those industries. You look at other manufacturing industries like the auto industry, whole building construction is a massive buyer of manufactured goods. They've actually been net hurt because they rely on a lot of imported goods, and the US just can't flip the switch quickly to produce those goods domestically. The agricultural sector has been impacted. We've seen countries like China has pulled back on buying US soybeans because of reciprocal tariffs, and tariffs on Chinese goods that are imported into the US. Semiconductor companies are feeling a huge pinch in China. Chinese companies are basically being told don't buy US chips unless you have no other choice. You look at the stock market, guys, this is an AI story. A JP Morgan analyst put out a research note, and he pointed out that since ChatGPT came out in November of 2022, three quarters of the S&P 500 returns have come from AI-related companies. Over that same period, 80% of the S&P 500's earnings growth has come from those companies. If you start peeling back the layers, it's obvious that we have a bifurcated market and economy. Plenty of companies are not doing well. In a lot of cases, because tariffs are either increasing their costs and/or putting pressure on already squeezed consumers who have been feeling the pinch from inflation for four years now.

Emily Flippen: I think it's a fair point that there's clearly this disconnect that's happening between what consumers are feeling and what the stock market is doing and what investors are experiencing. But if the stock market isn't actually the correct indicator of how well the economy is doing it, that's not the barometer we're looking at. If that's not the scoreboard, Dan, when you look at it, what is the right gauge for gauging or judging success?

Dan Caplinger: Well, I think there's a couple of directions that you can go with that, Emily. The first is to judge it from the goals that the administration had. I think that one of the primary goals that the Trump administration had was to make companies, both foreign and domestic, have the internal conversation. Are we interested in expanding US manufacturing capacity? Are we interested in sourcing more products that go to US consumers from US sources? That's the goal. I think those conversations are happening that they have taken place. As Jason said, the answer is not always going to be necessarily what the administration wanted, but they've definitely been able to define the conversation. They've been able to set the subject and put that in front of people, and let those folks come to whatever conclusions they have for their businesses. I think for big businesses, like Jason said, it's not always going to be a matter of flipping the switch, but it is a matter of if they make the decision to move more production and sourcing to US, that's going to be an option for them. It's the small businesses that I think have more trouble. Emily, I live in the middle of nowhere in Western Massachusetts. No big cities near me. There are plenty of small businesses that really did rely on cheaper goods from other countries in order to keep afloat. These tariffs, they are the marginal companies. They are the companies that are having to go out of business because of the extra costs due to the tariffs. They don't have the margins to be able to absorb those tariffs temporarily. That's the distinction that I see. The other thing that I think is a real issue is not so much the tariffs themselves, but the uncertainty surrounding how long are tariffs going to be in place? Are they going to be permanent? Is the rate going to change? Is it going to go up? Is it going to go down? It's impossible for businesses to have a good long-term sense of, OK, if an investment is going to take 5-10 years to pay off, is the policy just going to change back? Or is it going to get worse? Or am I making a smart decision? It's just really difficult to figure that out.

Jason Hall: That's exactly right, Dan. It takes years to transition manufacturing and supply chains. We're six months into this, guys. The bigger question that I think we don't know the answer to is will US buyers, whether it's consumers or businesses, are they going to be willing to soak up the higher cost to manufacture more things domestically? According to an American Enterprise Institute study, there's about $1.7 trillion in goods that the administration is targeting to try to bring to domestic manufacturing, and it would cost about 21% more to manufacture them at home. That's an extra $257 billion a year. Plus, there's another $348 billion in tariffs that the AEI estimates would have to remain in place to keep that US manufacturing competitive. That's $606 billion a year that American buyers would have to pay for the same goods we're buying today. I mentioned AI before. Maybe this is the problem that AI can help solve.

Dan Caplinger: Being a little glib.

Jason Hall: But maybe that actually is part of the answer.

Emily Flippen: Dare to dream here. I have to say, I think that part of the impact and part of the reason why there is that disconnect is just because we haven't felt the full force of the economic brunt of these tariffs. I saw some interesting data that was collected by Bloomberg over the course of the past month. They tracked more than two dozen of Temu. That is the shopping site owned by Pinduoduo, PDD Holdings, their most popular products. They found that their prices actually fell nearly 20% between April and September because they were attempting to make up for some of the costs that consumers were going to be paying for these tariffs. Further data collected by Goldman Sachs has shown that even American businesses have taken on the majority of the brunt of the cost of tariff impacts, that shoe will have to drop eventually, which is to say they can't continue to take on the impacts of tariffs to your point. Dan, we don't know exactly how long they're going to continue, what they could look like over the long term. Right now, consumers aren't bearing the full impact. I expect that, especially as we go into the holiday season, if we start to see some of those price increases come down the line, and businesses, whether they be domestic or foreign start to pass along those price increases, that's when we'll really start to see the economic impacts, and that's when we'll start to have it show up in our economic data as well. Up next, we'll be moving to the other side of the purchase equation to discuss TikTok, Prime Day, and how social commerce has redefined the shopping experience. Stick with us.

Today is the first day of Prime Day, and we're all underwhelmed. It seems like despite posting record dollars every year, a results that I have no doubt is driven by mainly inflation, enthusiasm from shoppers just always feel increasingly diffused year after year. Dan, when you look at Prime Day and social commerce in general, is this just a combination of weaker economic conditions or just shoppers changing the way that they're shopping or is it just something else entirely?

Dan Caplinger: I'm embarrassed to say that when we first talked about this topic, I was like, ""Whoa, it's going to be Prime Day again? Wasn't it just Prime Day like a few months ago?"" That's the thing is that we've been having Prime Day. Consumers like fresh concepts, fresh ideas. Prime Day is maybe hitting it past its prime, perhaps. It's been going on for 10 years now. It's a long time to keep it new, keep it interesting, keep it front and center. Amazon's done what they can to try to build and iterate and make it more interesting, but it's faced a bunch of problems. One is that the rest of retail said, ""Okay. Fine, Amazon, you want to create this new holiday for shopping in the middle of the year? Well, we'll be happy to sell to our customers at the same time on the same days as well."" It's not just Amazon having this random sale in the middle of the year. It's everybody else now jumping onto that and saying, ""Hey, people are in the mood to buy. Why don't you buy from us instead of them?"" Amazon hasn't really been able to maintain exclusive ownership of the event. The other thing I think is, keep in mind, Amazon, the original goal of Prime Day, probably first and foremost, was to try to get people to sign up for Amazon Prime, for the subscription service. Back in 2015, there were a lot of people who weren't Prime members. But 10 years later, there are a lot of Prime members. It's almost mission accomplished. There's just not that many people left to sign up. As a result, I think Amazon is facing this existential question with Prime Day. It's like, what do we want it this to be going forward? We've already done a great job of increasing our market share of the number of shoppers in the US and elsewhere who are Prime members. At the same time, plenty of other reasons to join Prime outside to shopping. It may be time for a reset, I think.

Jason Hall: Dan, I think it's more an indictment of you and me in our demographic, because you're not the only GenX dude on this podcast that did not realize that Prime Day was starting. Guys, I spend an embarrassingly large amount of money on Amazon every single week. That's the bottom line. But here's the thing. Literally, guys, as I'm typing out the outline, I get a text from my wife, and I'm going to read it to you guys now. I quote, ""I've got a slap full Amazon cart for Prime Day. I want to chat about it with you."" I don't really know if there's really anything else to say. We're not really the target anymore for that, but here's the other thing that I think maybe matters more. The noise around social shopping is pretty loud right now, but if there's anything we've learned from social media is that it's a great marketing channel, but literally nowhere across social media, his shopping is a habitual thing stuck. Facebook has tried it. Twitter has tried marketing. We've seen Pinterest make fits and starts attempts, and there's not a better social platform than Pinterest to be e-commerce. I think it may be a thing that maybe drives fashion trends and that thing, but it's more a top of the funnel. I think shopping is just a habitual thing. If you look at the numbers, again, we know that the lower and middle income consumers are the ones being squeezed. We can look at McDonald's and Amazon competitor Walmart as just some data points I think support it. McDonald's comps were 2.5% last quarter at the same source sales growth. That's lower than inflation. Walmart's revenue was up 5% in the second quarter. It's e-commerce sales are up 25%. That shows you there's still a lot of pressure. Then thinking about those inflation and tariff that we talked about before, GAAP operating income was actually down 8% and flat on an adjusted basis. I don't think we're going to see some massive disruption of retail from what's going on with TikTok potentially becoming US company or any of those sorts of things. It's just a tough time for consumers right now, and these big companies are feeling that pinch.

Emily Flippen: I actually disagree, Jason.

Jason Hall: I love the fact that you disagree.

Emily Flippen: I think you're right. Conceptually, big picture, you're right. But I do think when you look at social commerce in general, especially the way it operates in international geographies versus here in the United States, it just shows how people tend to engage with what they were raised on or habitualized. There's so many Prime shoppers, for instance, that were habitualized with buying on Amazon. To your point, Dan, it's no longer really about getting people to sign up for Prime. It's just a reminder you're mostly doing all your shopping on Amazon anyway, so it's just an excuse to maybe buy one or two extra things that went on sale today or maybe you delayed purchasing until they were on sale. When I look at the way that social commerce and e-commerce was built in places like China, back when mobile phones were accessible at the same exact time, credit cards were accessible. It just the way that people were going about purchasing and shopping was built on social before it was built on sites like Amazon. That has become habitual process of purchasing internationally. I don't necessarily think it has taken off in the United States exactly the same way it has internationally, but I think TikTok has been that turning point for buyers, and it's Prime Day every day on TikTok, so to speak. I worry a little bit big picture that the sale of TikTok could cause some people to either lose faith or engagement in the platform long-term, but I don't think that the idea of social commerce and purchasing based on trends or engagement with influencers, whatever it may be, I don't think that trend is going to go away, even if it shifts off of sites like TikTok. I am happy that Amazon has Amazon Web Services, which is generating something like 60% of its operating profit because Amazon, in my opinion, has been very slow to adjust to the social commerce trends. I worry a little bit that as we start to age out of the demographic here for commerce that they're not going to do a great job of convincing younger shoppers that they need to have an Amazon Prime membership.

Dan Caplinger: For me, the question as it goes with TikTok is going to be, what do content producing influencers decide to do? Are they going to take the shift in ownership and treat that as a catalyst to make them consider alternatives? If they do that, then that's going to be a shift, and the marketing will then follow the influencers. I don't think that it's going to be an external decision where external marketers tell influencers that they need to leave TikTok. I think that that's probably going to be an influencer judge decision, and I'll be curious to see how it works out, because if there is a big exodus among influencers from the platform, the question is going to be, what platform do they go to? Then that becomes the next TikTok, and then that becomes the next target of regulation. Where does that circle end?

Jason Hall: All roads lead to AI. AI is going to be doing our shopping for us in five years, guys.

Emily Flippen: I dare to dream there, Jason. If it could take care of my shopping for me, I would definitely take it up on it.

Emily Flippen: I hope everybody has already made their car purchases because September 30th was the last day for Americans to qualify for their federal EV tax credits. Automakers have been dreading this drop off for months now, and it could have come at a worse time. Tesla has really struggled to maintain deliveries. Ford's CEO expects EV sales could drop by half, and BYD just posted its first monthly year-over-year sales decline in more than a year-and-a-half. Jason, do electric vehicles need to shift in policies to drive adoption or is this just a temporary speed bump?

Jason Hall: I think we're about to find out, Emily. I know that's not a direct answer here, and I'm dancing around it a little bit, but I don't think we completely know a couple things. Our cars writ large have continued to become more expensive. Car prices on average are up about 16 new car prices on average are up about 16% since March 2021, according to Kelley Blue Book. That's helping create a little more parity to the cost of an EV versus an internal combustion engine powered car. There's still cost pressures, but the EV industry is starting to benefit from some other things to bring costs down. Higher scale manufacturing for batteries, and then advanced battery technology, they are bringing battery costs down. That's a big thing. I think those things might help over the longer term. We just don't really know how it's going to play out in the near term.

Dan Caplinger: I just don't think that tax credits are necessarily the linchpin of what determines the success in the EV industry at this point. To me, the key to adoption is reliable infrastructure. I'll just tell you, charging anywhere other than Tesla Supercharger Network, it's just a nightmare. I mean, I'm the target audience for this. I would love to drive an electric vehicle, and the electric vehicles that I've driven, I love how they perform. It's just really good acceleration. It's just the handling is great. But I'll tell you, I went to Florida, and the only rental car that they had left was an EV, a non-Tesla EV. It changed the complexion of the entire trip because suddenly, I had range anxiety. I couldn't just up and go to the next city down the coast to go check out the beach there and not think about, OK, am I going to have enough charge to get back in time for dinner? Where am I going to go? What are the charging options going to be? They really need to get the infrastructure up to speed before EV adoption is really going to hit the mainstream. Unfortunately, I'm not sure that's going to happen because at the policy level, we used to have tailwinds that were inspiring companies to spend on improving infrastructure for electric vehicles. That now in the current administration has turned into headwinds, not just on the tax credit side, but just on broader policy priorities and energy policy. With no real appetite for investment, I don't have nearly the expectation for improvement in EV infrastructure that I did a year ago.

Emily Flippen: The economic equation, especially as it applies to energy right now in a more expensive world for energy has gotten more expensive for electric vehicles. Without the incentives, at least as the environment exists right now, it's really hard to make the math work for new car purchases to move electric versus traditional.

Jason Hall: Well, just on the purchaser side, if you look on the manufacturing side, Tesla's bottom line may be hit more because of the loss of some tax credits that they were able to sell to other automakers to offset some tax liability. That's billions of dollars a year in high margin revenue that is going to completely go away. Part of the answer for that Tesla, after we record this today, is supposed to be announcing a lower cost model. Why? I think as much as anything, that's an immediate evidence that the automakers are having to react quickly with cost cuts to be competitive. Let me just say this last thing. Besides Tesla and BYD, find another mass market automaker. I'm throwing Ferrari out here. That's a brand that they're selling. Find an automaker, EV or otherwise, that has been a market beating investments over the past decade, and you will not find them besides again, Tesla and BYD. Most of the other EV stocks, they've wiped out tens of billions in investor value. This is just a tough, brutal industry. Even Tesla's future is less tied to cars and more to AI, autonomy services, robotics, and those sorts of things. They need to make profit from cars to pay for that stuff, but this is just a tough industry. If I were an investor, looking in this space, I would immediately go find somewhere else where the tailwinds are tied to profits. Hey, guys, maybe artificial intelligence. What do you say?

Dan Caplinger: I do have to say, though, Jason, I think that Tesla does have the opportunity to extract even more money for supercharger access to the other automakers for exactly the reasons that you just mentioned. Because of these policy headwinds, that could be a nice addition to Tesla's cash cow business there that could help fund AI, robotics, automation, all those other priorities.

Emily Flippen: Well, as always, I like to sign off here with the lightning rounds. Maybe you'll have some more hot takes for us, Jason. We discussed a lot of things today, electric vehicles, online shopping, tariff policies, so I really want to put you both and myself included on the spot to maybe give one of our favorite stocks that's likely to benefit from one of the broader trends we talked about. Dan, let me go to you first.

Dan Caplinger: I'm going to mention Symbotic. This is ticker SYM on the NASDAQ. It's a company. It's been heavily involved in improving warehouse storage technology, basically automating the warehouse with autonomous robots that help streamline movement of goods inside of those facilities, make the supply chain more efficient. I think that that company potentially benefits both from tariff-related pushes to get more manufacturing and warehousing back onshore, as well as just the overall positive trends in e-commerce over time.

Jason Hall: Well, I've mentioned AI a ton of time, so I might as well stick with that. Dan, you brought up robotics in warehouses, and this just lines up perfectly. Let's talk about Amazon again. It's winning from AI with its own AI-driven products. AWS, a lot of compute to build artificial intelligence is happening at AWS. We know that's the profit driver there, as you mentioned. Emily, it's starting to supercharge its Alexa products with AI. It's using AI to help shoppers. Also, hat tip to Dan on this one. Like I said, guys, it's one of the largest robotics companies on Earth, and people sometimes forget about that. I think it's later this year, if they haven't already passed it, Amazon will have actually deployed more robots in its warehouse than human workers. That's a big leg up in driving those costs down, Dan. Like you said, that helps offset the impact of tariffs and also labor inflation on its bottom line. One last thing, I'll do a little Steve Jobs here, too. Let's not forget about Zoox. That's the autonomous right hailing start-up that Amazon bought back in 2020. Largely, guess what? They got a lot of great AI and robotic stuff that's part of that. Three decades later, Amazon's still square in the middle of all of the innovations that are going to be changing the world for decades to come.

Emily Flippen: Well, now, I feel very insecure about the stock that I was going to go with because I feel sold. I'd never heard of Symbotic before, Dan, and you're staying. Of course, I know Amazon, and maybe my skepticism there on the commerce side is unwarranted, but I was actually going to go with BYD. The ticker is BYDDY.

Jason Hall: One of the only winners in the EV space. This is a great choice.

Emily Flippen: Well, I will say, I take to heart what you mentioned about the fact that cars have traditionally or automobile manufacturers have traditionally not been great investments. It's a pretty heavily commoditized space. They compete really heavily on price. But the reason why I like BYD, I mean, this is a battery company at its heart with a management team that has been incredibly focused on what I think is most important to win in this space, which is efficiency. BYD is really the only low-cost electric vehicle manufacturer that is managing to make vehicles worldwide at a rate that is, in my opinion, accessible to the average person. When we talk about the economic decision making for car purchases, being really against adoption of electric vehicles right now, that means the lowest cost model probably is the one that wins. I'm disappointed that we don't have more updates out from Tesla on the day that we're taping this. We're owed it today. Hasn't come out by the time that we're finishing taping. Maybe Tesla will eventually come out with their low-cost model, but BYD, in my opinion, is just leaps and bounds ahead when it comes to the accessibility of low-cost electric vehicles. That's going, in my opinion, really underappreciated by American investors. Well, fools, we hope that that was a hopefully somewhat interesting and useful podcast. We discussed lots of different topics. Ending here with some of our favorite investments that hopefully everybody could consider potentially adding to their portfolios. Jason and Dan, thank you both so much for joining today.

Dan Caplinger: Thanks, Emily.

Q: How Does New Texas Corporate Law Affect Merger and Acquisition Processes?","Texas Corporate Law Changes: What Businesses Need to Know

Texas has positioned itself as a leading business jurisdiction through comprehensive corporate law reforms enacted in 2025. These changes make Texas an increasingly attractive jurisdiction to reincorporate. Understanding these modifications is essential for in-house counsel evaluating Texas as their jurisdiction of choice.

Q: What Is the New Texas Business Judgment Rule Statute?

A: Senate Bill 29, already in effect, codifies the business judgment rule in new Section 21.419 of the Texas Business Organizations Code, creating significant advantages for companies domiciled in the state. This statute creates a legal presumption that directors and officers acted in good faith, on an informed basis, in the corporation’s best interests, and in compliance with law and governing documents.

Key Protections: Directors and officers receive the benefit of presumed good faith in their decision-making processes, with courts required to assume they acted on an informed basis when making corporate decisions. The law further presumes that all board actions were taken in the corporation’s best interests and in full compliance with applicable law and governing documents.

Eligibility Requirements: The statute applies automatically to public corporations with voting shares listed on national securities exchanges, providing immediate benefits for Texas-based companies already trading publicly. Private corporations may access these same protections by including an affirmative election in their governing documents, creating flexibility for businesses.

Litigation Impact: Shareholders face a significantly higher burden when challenging director or officer decisions. Successful litigation requires shareholders to rebut the statutory presumptions and prove that breaches involved fraud, intentional misconduct, ultra vires acts or knowing legal violations.

Q: What Is the Advance Independence Determination Process in Texas?

A: Senate Bill 29 empowers boards of public corporations and private corporations that have opted into the business judgment rule to form committees of independent directors for conflict-of-interest transactions. These committees can petition the Texas Business Court for advance determinations regarding director independence.

Committee Formation Process: Boards of public corporations and opted-in private corporations may form committees composed entirely of independent directors to handle conflict-of-interest transactions. These committees operate with enhanced authority to evaluate transactions involving controlling shareholders, directors or officers, providing a structured approach to potential conflicts.

Court Petition Requirements: These independent director committees may petition the Texas Business Court for advance determinations regarding director independence for specific transactions. The court’s determination becomes dispositive unless new evidence emerges showing a director lacks independence for the particular transaction under review. This creates legal certainty that protects both the corporation and its directors.

Legal Benefits: This mechanism allows corporations to resolve independence questions proactively rather than defending these determinations in subsequent litigation. The advance determination process reduces both legal risk and transaction costs, providing businesses with significant advantages over jurisdictions that lack similar procedures.

Q: What Ownership Thresholds Apply to Derivative Lawsuits in Texas?

A: Senate Bill 29 provides enhanced protection against frivolous shareholder litigation through carefully calibrated ownership requirements. These provisions help prevent nuisance litigation while preserving meaningful oversight rights for shareholders with substantial economic stakes.

Minimum Ownership Requirements: Public corporations and qualifying private corporations domiciled in Texas with 500 or more shareholders may establish minimum ownership requirements for derivative lawsuit eligibility. Corporations may include provisions in their certificate of formation or bylaws requiring shareholders to own up to 3 percent of outstanding shares before filing derivative actions.

Implementation Timeline: Corporations must have these provisions in their governing documents before derivative proceedings are instituted to benefit from the protection. This requirement encourages proactive governance planning and rewards companies that adopt comprehensive protective measures.

Litigation Prevention Benefits: The 3 percent maximum threshold ensures the requirement remains reasonable and accessible while effectively preventing shareholders with minimal economic stakes from pursuing costly litigation. This balance preserves legitimate corporate oversight while reducing the burden of defending against weak or opportunistic claims.

Q: When Can Texas Corporations Limit Books and Records Demands?

A: Senate Bill 29 restricts books and records demands for public corporations and private corporations that have opted into the business judgment rule, providing additional protection for companies. These limitations prevent shareholders from using inspection rights as discovery tools while preserving legitimate oversight purposes.

Denial Grounds: Corporations may deny books and records demands when they reasonably determine the request connects to active or pending derivative proceedings involving the requesting shareholder or expected adversarial civil litigation. This protection prevents shareholders from circumventing normal discovery procedures through inspection rights.

Electronic Communications Exclusions: The legislation clarifies that emails, text messages, electronic communications and social media content are not subject to books and records demands unless the communication effectuates corporate action. This modernizes inspection rights for the digital age while protecting routine corporate communications from fishing expeditions.

Litigation Prevention Strategy: These provisions create a balanced approach that protects corporations from abusive inspection requests while maintaining shareholders’ legitimate oversight rights. Companies benefit from clearer boundaries around books and records access compared to less defined standards in other jurisdictions.

Q: How Does Texas Address Disclosure-Only Settlements?

A: Senate Bill 29 eliminates incentives for disclosure-only settlements that primarily benefit attorneys rather than shareholders. This reform addresses a persistent problem in shareholder litigation across multiple jurisdictions.

Attorney Fee Recovery Changes: The amended law modifies attorney fee recovery provisions in derivative proceedings by specifically stating that additional or amended disclosures to shareholders, regardless of materiality, do not constitute a “substantial benefit” to the corporation. This eliminates the primary incentive for disclosure-only settlements that generate attorney fees without providing meaningful shareholder value.

Litigation Outcome Improvements: The modification encourages substantive litigation outcomes while reducing frivolous lawsuits designed primarily to generate attorney fees through minimal disclosure enhancements. Attorneys must now demonstrate actual corporate benefit beyond mere additional disclosures to recover fees from corporations.

Strategic Advantages: Texas-basedcompanies benefit from reduced settlement pressure in weak derivative claims, as plaintiffs’ attorneys lose the primary economic incentive for filing disclosure-focused litigation. This creates a more predictable litigation environment that favors defendants with strong legal positions.

Q: What Jury Trial and Forum Selection Rights Do Texas Companies Have?

A: Senate Bill 29 codifies forum selection and jury trial waiver rights, providing predictable litigation frameworks for businesses. These provisions give entities greater control over dispute resolution procedures and reduce forum shopping by plaintiffs seeking favorable jurisdictions.

Forum Selection Provisions: Texas entities may include exclusive forum selection clauses in their governing documents for internal entity claims, which include derivative actions and other matters arising from or relating to the entity’s internal affairs. This allows entities to specify Texas courts as exclusive forums for internal entity disputes, providing predictable litigation venues.

Jury Trial Waiver Benefits: The jury trial waiver applies to all internal entity claims, allowing more predictable resolution of complex corporate disputes through bench trials. This is particularly valuable for sophisticated corporate law matters that benefit from judicial expertise rather than jury deliberation.

Strategic Litigation Control: These provisions provide enhanced control over where and how corporate disputes are resolved. The combination of forum selection and jury trial waiver creates a more predictable and efficient litigation environment compared to jurisdictions without similar protections.

Q: What Are the New Class and Series Voting Changes?

A: Senate Bill 29 eliminates mandatory separate class and series voting requirements that previously created barriers for corporations in Texas. This change addresses incompatibilities between rigid voting requirements and complex capital structures common in multi-class corporations.

Voting Structure Flexibility: The amended law allows Texas corporations to design voting structures that better align with their business needs and investor expectations, rather than being constrained by inflexible statutory requirements. This flexibility is particularly valuable for technology companies and other entities with multiple share classes that provide different voting and economic rights to various stakeholder groups.

Multi-Class Corporation Benefits: Previously, rigid voting requirements were often incompatible with sophisticated capital structures that separate economic rights from voting control. The new law accommodates these arrangements while maintaining appropriate shareholder protections through alternative governance mechanisms.

Relocation Advantages: This reform removes a significant barrier that previously deterred complex corporate entities from choosing Texas as their jurisdiction. Companies with sophisticated capital structures can now pursue Texas relocation without being forced to restructure their existing voting arrangements to comply with inflexible statutory requirements.

Q: What Are the Shareholder Proposal Requirements in Texas?

A: Senate Bill 1057, already in effect, allows qualifying Texas corporations to adopt minimum ownership requirements for shareholder proposals, effective September 1, 2025. These requirements ensure that only shareholders with significant economic stakes and broad support can submit proposals, reducing frivolous or disruptive shareholder activism.

Eligibility Requirements: Eligible corporations must have securities registered under the Securities Exchange Act and be listed on national exchanges. They must also either have their principal office in Texas or list on Texas-based exchanges, creating incentives for companies to establish meaningful Texas connections as part of their strategy to reincorporate in the state.

Ownership Thresholds: Corporations that opt into these provisions require shareholders to hold at least $1 million in market value or three percent of outstanding voting shares for six months before and throughout shareholder meetings. In addition, shareholders must solicit holders of at least 67 percent of voting power entitled to vote on the proposal, demonstrating broad shareholder support.

Shareholder Activism Protection: These requirements create meaningful barriers to frivolous proposals while preserving legitimate shareholder oversight rights. The combination of economic stake requirements and broad support thresholds ensures that only well-supported initiatives reach the proxy process, reducing costs and distractions for management and boards.

Q: How Are Proxy Advisory Services Regulated in Texas?

A: Senate Bill 2337, already in effect, imposes disclosure requirements on proxy advisory firms serving Texas public companies, effective September 1, 2025. This legislation provides companies with greater transparency regarding the basis for proxy advisor recommendations and creates enforcement mechanisms for violations.

Covered Entity Requirements: The law applies to companies incorporated in Texas, with principal places of business in Texas, or proposing to redomicile in Texas. This broad coverage ensures that companies benefit from enhanced proxy advisor oversight regardless of their current jurisdiction.

Disclosure Obligations: Proxy advisors must provide detailed disclosures when recommendations are based on nonfinancial factors, including environmental, social, governance (ESG), diversity, equity, inclusion (DEI), or sustainability considerations. They must also disclose when advice subordinates shareholder financial interests to other objectives, providing shareholders with clearer information about recommendation methodologies.

Enforcement Mechanisms: Violations constitute deceptive trade practices under Texas law, with enforcement available to companies, shareholders, advisory clients, and the Texas Attorney General. This creates significant compliance obligations for major proxy advisory firms and provides multiple avenues for addressing violations.

Q: What Officer Exculpation Provisions Does Texas Law Offer?

A: Senate Bill 2411, already in effect, extends exculpation protections to officers equivalent to existing director protections. This reform addresses a competitive disadvantage that previously made Texas less attractive for sophisticated corporate entities.

Protection Scope: Texas entities may eliminate or limit officer monetary liability for acts or omissions in their official capacity through certificate of formation amendments. This protection provides officers with liability shields similar to those available to directors under existing law, creating comprehensive protection for corporate leadership.

Exclusions from Protection: Exculpation does not apply to breaches of loyalty duties, bad faith acts involving intentional misconduct or knowing legal violations, transactions providing improper benefits or acts with express statutory liability. These exclusions preserve accountability for the most serious forms of misconduct while protecting officers from liability for good faith business decisions.

Competitive Advantages: This protection enhances Texas’ competitiveness with Delaware and other jurisdictions that offer similar officer protections. Companies can now offer executives liability protection equivalent to what they would receive in other major corporate jurisdictions, removing a potential barrier to relocation.

Q: When Can Boards Amend Certificates of Formation Without Shareholder Approval in Texas?

A: Senate Bill 2411 expands circumstances allowing board amendments to certificates of formation without shareholder approval, reducing administrative burdens for Texas reincorporation and ongoing compliance. These provisions streamline routine corporate maintenance while preserving shareholder approval requirements for substantive changes.

Administrative Amendment Authority: Boards may remove provisions specifying initial directors’ or organizers’ names and addresses, which are required in initial certificates but become obsolete after formation. This eliminates the need for shareholder approval to update routine administrative information that serves no ongoing purpose.

Stock Split Authorization: For single-class corporations without series, boards may effect stock splits or reverse stock splits without shareholder approval if the reverse split’s primary purpose is maintaining national exchange listing eligibility. This provides flexibility for corporations to maintain compliance with exchange requirements without the delay and expense of shareholder meetings.

Operational Benefits: These provisions reduce administrative costs for routine corporate maintenance while preserving meaningful shareholder participation in substantive governance decisions. Companies benefit from more efficient ongoing compliance procedures compared to jurisdictions with more restrictive amendment requirements.

Q: How Does New Texas Corporate Law Affect Merger and Acquisition Processes?

A: Senate Bill 2411 streamlines merger and acquisition processes through several mechanisms that reduce transaction complexity and provide greater certainty for deal participants. These improvements make Texasmore attractive for companies engaged in frequent M&A activity.

Board Approval Flexibility: Boards may approve plans, agreements and documents in “substantially final” form rather than requiring final versions, providing greater negotiation flexibility during transaction processes. This reduces the need for multiple board meetings and allows for more efficient deal management while maintaining appropriate board oversight.

Shareholder Representative Authority: The law expressly authorizes shareholder representatives to act on behalf of shareholders in mergers and interest exchanges, including enforcement and settlement authority. This delegation provides clearer legal authority for post-closing activities and reduces uncertainty about representative powers.

Pre-Formation and Documentation Benefits: Pre-formation equity subscriptions become irrevocable if written, signed and explicitly state irrevocability, providing greater certainty for investors and companies in formation transactions. In addition, disclosure schedules and similar documents are not considered part of merger plans unless explicitly stated, reducing documentation complexity and potential liability exposure.

Listen below for the full conversation with Michael Lombardi, and tune in to hear the segment live on Monday mornings each game week!","UNC football general manager Michael Lombardi joined 97.9 The Hill’s Aaron Keck this morning for “The Monday Morning Huddle,” presented by Chapel Hill Tire.

The Tar Heels’ struggles continued in their fifth game of the season against Clemson, as the Tigers led 35-3 at halftime on their way to a 38-10 win in Kenan Stadium. UNC enjoyed an off week after that, but it was far from restful: rumors swirled about head coach Bill Belichick being on his way out of Chapel Hill, though the university has insisted Belichick is staying put. Now, UNC turns its attention to a long road trip to Cal this Friday.

Here are a few of Lombardi’s answers on various topics:

On how the team is feeling after a challenging bye week: I think the team is focused on Cal. Last week, there was a lot of noise outside our building, but our building has maintained a semblance of consistency in terms of progress and wanting to improve. And our players have been dedicated. Last week for example, after our practice on Thursday, we had six players for the first time in this program squat over 600 pounds. We had over 30 players have their best personal times in terms of their speed training. So the players are fully invested. One of the things we preach to the team constantly is mental toughness, being able to block out distractions. And what Coach and I have to do with all the noise that’s around the program is block out the distractions and show the players that we have mental toughness.

On an investigative report from WRAL detailing a toxic environment within the program: I don’t know about a WRAL report. I’m not sure there’s been a lot of accuracy coming from that area, but our players are committed to getting better. I think everybody understands it’s a work in progress. Look, we just played one ACC game, we have seven games ahead of us. I don’t think anybody on our team has written off the season or written off anything that we can accomplish. We understand we have to get better and we understand we have to play more competitively in the ACC games, and I think our team wants to do that. I’m not sure there’s the disconnect that that has been reported. No one’s been around our program with any accuracy to really understand that other than the coaches on our staff.

On his message to the fans: The program is about building something that’s sustainable for over a long time. And I think ultimately we’re going to improve and the players are fully engaged. Anything that is successful has taken time. Nick Saban said it the other day: in his first year at Alabama, he struggled and overcame the obstacles. That’s what we want to do. Look, I’m not asking anybody to embrace losing. I wrote that email about not wanting to lose. We want to win here, but we also want to build a program that’s sustainable, doing the right things, fundamentally being the in the right techniques and doing all those things. And we will. Bill has been successful in his career and I think he’ll prove to be successful here in North Carolina.

Why should fans be patient? We haven’t had a recruiting class. We got here late in December and the portal was winding down when we arrived and then we had a spring portal and we really didn’t have a high school recruiting class. Because of that, we took a lot of players in the second recruiting window. So we’re really excited about our recruiting class. We’re gonna have a large class. We’re excited about the players. And what I was really excited about was our players in the building and outside the building that we’ve recruited are all in. You could see it by their example: what they’ve said, what they’ve tweeted, how they feel about our program because they have been inside the walls. They have talked to the coaches and talked to the head coach. Anything worth its weight in gold takes time. You have to be prepared to build something sustainable and I think ultimately that’s what we’re going to do. I don’t know how long it will take, but we’re gonna work diligently to make sure that it happens.

The initial 18650 and 21700 format cells, developed under the HPQ ENDURA+ brand, mark a key step in the company’s transition from pilot testing to market engagement.

HPQ expects to reach an annual production capacity of up to 1.5 million cells through its partnership with Novacium. The newly manufactured batches will be used in direct discussions with prospective clients across various sectors, including mobility and electronics.

Cell production for the HPQ ENDURA+ line is subcontracted to an unnamed large-scale battery manufacturer. This enables immediate integration into high-throughput lines without the need for new infrastructure, HPQ said. It also enables HPQ and Novacium to focus on the development and optimization of their silicon-based anode materials, while leveraging established manufacturing expertise.

HPQ confirmed that it now holds finalized product specification sheets for the 4,000 mAh 18650 and 6,000 mAh 21700 battery formats, providing technical precision to interested partners. The batteries deliver up to 1,000 charge cycles, while comparable 18650 cells available on the market typically offer between 2,500 and 3,500 mAh and shorter life spans below 500 cycles.

“These first shipments demonstrate our ability to execute and move swiftly from R&D to commercial readiness,” said Bernard J. Tourillon, Chairman, President and CEO of HPQ Silicon Inc. “We are now in a position to put our batteries in front of customers, backed by real performance data and a clear path to scaled production.”",https://chargedevs.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-08-29-at-10.42.43-AM-copy.jpg,N,,2025-10-13 20:02:03.446007

America’s gradual loss of democracy worries me, as our executive branch is seizing the powers of our legislature and courts and using that power to oppress minorities. Millions of people will be harmed or killed by President Trump’s policies.

This is a tragedy we should resist mightily, but his dictatorship will not last forever. Countries have been turned into dictatorships and have eventually freed themselves in the past. And if we show enough courage, we could remake an American democracy, better than before.

I am even more worried by Trump’s attack on the renewable energy industry and his giveaways to the fossil fuel industry. Last year, the fossil fuel industry gave $219 million to help elect Trump and the Republican congressional majority, according to Yale Climate Connections.

Now this industry is getting its payoff. The president is trying to stop the transition to renewable energy at a time when climate change is becoming more dangerous. And we are passing environmental tipping points now, which will cause our climate to worsen even after we switch completely to renewable energy.

If we recover from this environmental assault, it will take thousands of years, and it is likely that more than a quarter of all species of life on Earth will become extinct.

We’re all participating in a race that will determine the fate of our children. On one side is climate change, and the world’s best scientists tell us that this is accelerating faster than anyone expected. On the other side is renewable energy, and this is also growing faster than anyone expected, because renewable energy is much cheaper than fossil fuels.

There will be no decisive winner of this race, as both racers will continue running. One day, the building up of renewable energy may be completed, but our climate will then be far more dangerous than it is today.

Much of the world will become uninhabitable, our Gulf Coast will be too hot, too many wildfires in the Rockies, flooding of our coastlines and too severe storms in certain areas. Many American climate refugees will emigrate to Maine, and how will this affect our already extreme housing shortage?

What is not yet clear is how many people will be able to adjust to the new climate, or whether the Earth will be too damaged for us all. We should be improving our families’ chances of surviving and having good lives by accelerating our efforts to stop climate change, not by halting these efforts.

The steps we take today to reduce climate change will have much more impact than the steps we could take years from now. All of this is to say that the president is endangering and harming our families’ lives when he does the bidding of the fossil fuel industry, protecting them from their competition, renewable energy.

As time goes by, it will become clearer and clearer that we are quietly watching a terrible crime against humanity and all life on Earth.

We must ask Sens. King and Collins and our House representatives to push harder to protect the climate legislation that was starting to safeguard our children. How did we learn to sit on our hands while someone harms our children’s lives just to make more money?

“This could enable us to identify ADRD early and also identify risk factors that could be treated at an earlier stage.
Personal risk factors are often embedded within the free text of clinical notes or discharge summaries that are not easily searchable, computable or standardized.
Boland hopes the research identifies existing ADRD risk factors and uncovers new risk factors.
She has long been fascinated by hidden differences among individuals that can alter disease risk—sometimes termed latent disease—including hidden genetic or environmental differences.","LATROBE, PA — Saint Vincent College recently received a $150,000 National Science Foundation (NSF) grant with Dr. Mary Regina Boland, C’10, assistant professor of data science, as principal investigator. This funding is part of a $1 million grant with three other institutions: University of Pennsylvania, University of Iowa and University of Virginia.

The project is titled “Personal Determinants of Health-Enhanced Machine Learning Models for Early Prediction of Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias.” Fruits of this project will advance national health and promote science and technology development by providing algorithms, software and systems that can train machine learning models on electronic health records for accurate and early prediction of Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD).

ADRD are debilitating conditions that affect over 5 million people over the age of 65, characterized by progressive memory loss, cognitive impairment and personality changes, which can further evolve to dementia and death.

The population of the United States is aging, as evidenced by the “Vintage 2024 Population Estimates” released in June by the US Census Bureau. The findings reported that older adults outnumber children in 11 states and nearly half of US counties.

Simultaneously, the number of US citizens suffering from ADRD is growing. Boland warns that unless research provides solutions for early identification and treatment of ADRD, the burden on the nation’s healthcare system will be unparalleled.

“The purpose of this project is to learn patterns from those who have or had ADRD in the past to understand those who may be developing ADRD,” she said. “This could enable us to identify ADRD early and also identify risk factors that could be treated at an earlier stage. With earlier treatment, we are hoping the effects of this devastating disease will be ameliorated.”

Recent studies have shown that personal risk factors such as education, employment and lifestyle or family history significantly influence ADRD onset and progression.

These factors, however, are not recorded in a structured format within existing electronic health records. Personal risk factors are often embedded within the free text of clinical notes or discharge summaries that are not easily searchable, computable or standardized. This creates a major technical barrier for their integration into ADRD prediction models.

The research project aims to develop a computational platform using novel machine learning and natural language processing methods to automatically extract personal risk factors from clinical narratives within electronic health records and leverage them for accurate and early prediction of ADRD. Boland hopes the research identifies existing ADRD risk factors and uncovers new risk factors.

“By learning new risk factors and understanding the patterns of these risk factors, we hope to both identify ADRD earlier in the disease and also identify potential avenues for treatment and other therapies,” she said.

Certain individuals develop ADRD at a younger age, Boland added, and/or also progress more rapidly than others once they are diagnosed. The reasons are unclear but can be due to different factors, including exposure to various toxins. Patients with a greater lifetime exposure to a toxin will suffer greater effects from that toxin, therefore any toxins implicated in ADRD will more affect those with a longer exposure.

“Because toxin exposures vary by where we live and work, this effect can result in differential exposures among individuals,” Boland said. “This results in diversity among the ADRD phenotype observed among various populations.”

The work will continue for several years with an estimated end date of Sept. 30, 2029.

Boland has been studying population-level differences in disease risk and exposure risk for over a decade and has investigated specific environmental exposures and less specific ones, such as seasonal variability. She has long been fascinated by hidden differences among individuals that can alter disease risk—sometimes termed latent disease—including hidden genetic or environmental differences.

Boland’s interest in the environmental causes of diseases stems from growing up near an area that was deemed a superfund site by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Thousands of contaminated sites—or superfund sites—exist in the country due to hazardous waste being dumped, left out in the open or otherwise improperly managed. These sites include manufacturing facilities, processing plants, landfills and mining sites, according to the EPA.

“I witnessed several individuals who I grew up with die at a very early age,” Boland said, “and in many cases, it was difficult to identify the cause until much later.”

Looking ahead, Boland hopes to engage students with this research project to help them learn skills with real-world datasets to health analytics and ADRD.

“We need to train the future generation of scientists, researchers and analysts to be able to study and conduct ethical research,” Boland said. “I have had the pleasure of interacting with several students who have helped with literature review, and I am hoping to include them in modeling in the future.”

This is Boland’s second NSF grant as principal investigator while at Saint Vincent College. The first, also in association with three other institutions of higher education, and for the award period 2024-2027, is titled “Strengthening Collaborative Advancements Leveraging Equitable University Partnerships.” Fellow principal investigators for this grant are Fr. Michael Antonacci, O.S.B., C’07, S’14, associate professor of physics, and Dr. Stephen Jodis, dean of the Herbert W. Boyer School of Natural Science, Mathematics and Computing.

Boland also published a textbook with Springer Nature in January titled “Health Analytics with R: Learning Data Science Using Examples from Healthcare and Direct-to-Consumer Genetics.” Since its release, the textbook has sold over 5,000 copies both online and in print.",https://www.stvincent.edu/news/2025/10/files/news-thumbnail-national-science-foundation-grant.webp,N,,2025-10-13 19:01:57.022723

Because power plants last forty years or more, due to inflation, a new plant always costs lots more than the unit it’s replacing.
Unlike coal or gas-fired power plants, renewables only “consume” free stuff like wind or sunlight.
More fossil-fired power plants are just fine with them so long as the bulk electricity is affordable and available.
Whether this will lead to a vast increase in new fossil-fired power plant development remains to be seen.","One of the biggest mistakes we made about electrification is that we assumed that the new technologies embracing electricity, like electric vehicles for example, would embrace decarbonization at the same time. We were wrong. In fact, in the US today, exactly the opposite has occurred. The paradox of electrification without decarbonization is simple. Take, for example, two convenient symbols of electrification, an electric car and a heat pump. Both displace fossil fuel usage, but both technologies also rely on electricity. We, and others, assumed that the large base load fossil-fired power generating stations favored by utilities would, due to growing public pressure, eventually be replaced by something more environmentally benign, like small modular reactors or extensive solar plus batteries. Instead, policymakers have decided to ignore environmental concerns and embrace more base load fossil fuel usage. In practical terms, this means permission to build new natural gas-fired power plants, while coal-fired power stations will be permitted or even encouraged to remain open.

Because power plants last forty years or more, due to inflation, a new plant always costs lots more than the unit it’s replacing. One of the frequent criticisms of renewable energy technologies like offshore wind or solar plus batteries is that they are very expensive. This is certainly true compared to the fully depreciated facility they are replacing. The simple fact is that all new power-generating facilities, regardless of technology, are far more costly than the units they replace. These are called capital expenses because the assets financed are expected to be in service for decades. But renewables have one outstanding advantage over fossil-fueled power generation. They have almost no big operating expenses like fuel. Unlike coal or gas-fired power plants, renewables only “consume” free stuff like wind or sunlight. Over a thirty or forty year lifetime operating period, the expense differentials are enormous. But in our intensely ideological times, these differences are often overlooked for partisan political purposes. And yes, we know they’re intermittent.

This idea of electrification without decarbonization has been adopted by technology executives such as Google’s former CEO, Eric Schmidt. Speaking at an AI conference last October, he pointed out that for him, and presumably other executives, attaining environmental goals like decarbonization is much less important than a vastly expanded network of data centers. His basic point was, ""Forget about your climate targets, you won’t achieve them anyway.” Also he suggested that perhaps all these new data centers would actually solve the climate crisis. But as a former CEO, he also seemed to be asserting one very old corporate prerogative: the unlimited right of a corporation to pollute without interference from the government. As an aside, what’s so interesting to us is that no serious political figure has given such full-throated support for this view, probably since the McKinley era. But here we are.

People like Mr Schmidt and his former employer, Google, are among those leading the charge for much more rapid growth in domestic power generation resources, and they’ve stated quite plainly that they couldn’t care less about CO2 emissions and their adverse environmental implications. More fossil-fired power plants are just fine with them so long as the bulk electricity is affordable and available. Their “only” requirement is for an enormous increment to the existing generating fleet at a cost of at least several hundred billion dollars. These investments will either be “inside the fence” and paid for by the data centers themselves or they will be borne by local utilities with the large incremental expense passed along to consumers in the form of higher prices.

The question for us as analysts is to ask whether this view has become mainstream among senior policymakers in Washington and, if so, what are the implications? What would a pollution-indifferent buildout of the US power grid look like? In two words, more gas. There have been no new coal-fired power-generating plants built in the US in decades because their economics were undercut by domestically sourced natural gas. So a pollution-tolerant administration in Washington, for example, does not reverse the unattractive power plant economics of new coal. But the interesting thing for us is that even with a utility-friendly administration in Washington, the prospects for future gas-fired plants haven’t deviated much from long term historical trends. The US EIA expects about 18.7 gigawatts of new gas fired capacity to be added between now and 2028, with 2028 showing a big uplift relative to prior years. But the EIA’s historical data also show us what a big commitment to new gas-fired power generation truly looks like. In the five year period, 2000 to 2005, the US added over 160 gigawatts of new gas-fired power generation, with almost 50 gigawatts of new generation added in the year 2000 alone. The EIA data shows the US expecting to add about 11 gigawatts in 2028, a supposed breakout year. Like the man said, those are rookie numbers.

All we can conclude at this point is that policymakers in Washington have created an administrative permission structure for more pollution from fossil-fired power-generating stations. Whether this will lead to a vast increase in new fossil-fired power plant development remains to be seen. Despite what we and many others expected, the present goal seems to be more electrification, especially for AI, and without decarbonization.

Automakers and suppliers “have underestimated the need for battery testing,” Thomas Parker, automotive sales manager for Inficon, said at an interview last week in Detroit, where he was attending the Battery Show.

Moisture and electric power don’t mix. Hybrids combine traditional internal combustion engines with electric power. Electric vehicles rely on all electric power.

“It all goes back to what happens when something goes wrong,” the Inficon executive said.

Inficon’s inspection operations have customers across various other industries, including medical devices and electric-storage systems.

“We’re being pulled into other things,” Parker said. “I had a pacemaker company in my booth (at the Battery Show) this morning.

“All of our customers want to be sure of their measurements,” he added. “They want to be more certain of what they’re doing.”

“The big business opportunity we have is lawyer driven,” Parker said. “It all goes back to what happens when something goes wrong.”

In the U.S., the Trump administration has cooled off EV fervor that took root during the Biden administration. A $7,500 U.S. tax credits for EVs has expired.

But electrification, including EVs and hybrids, has continued to expand, albeit as a slower pace.

Last month, Volvo Cars said it add a “next-generation hybrid model” to its Ridgeville plant outside Charleston, South Carolina.

Outside the U.S., China continues to expand EV offerings. Chinese automakers have also cut back vehicle development time.

American consumers are open to buying cheaper electric vehicles from Chinese automakers, according to a semi-annual report.

Ameren Missouri cut off power to 14,999 customers in September, according to records published by the Missouri Public Service Commission on Monday. That's in addition to the 14,375 customers that the regulated monopoly utility company disconnected in August, nearly triple the number of people it cut off in July.

Thousands more Missourians will likely be cut off from their power in October, as records from previous years show that's when Ameren cuts off the most people. For example, the utility cut 20,083 customers off from power in October of 2022, compared with the 9,366 and 2,475 it cut off that September and August, respectively.

The utility said it expects bills to be lower in October due to cooler temperatures, but wouldn't confirm whether this October's disconnections are showing similar trends to previous years. It also said it distributed $2.4 million in energy assistance payments in September and $1.2 million in August.

Missouri electricity bills expected to keep increasing due to data centers

A study commissioned by the Consumers Council of Missouri found that electricity and gas rates in Missouri are already rising faster than both national inflation and the state's job wage growth. Ameren hiked its electricity rates by nearly 12% for the average customer this year, and prices are expected to continue rising due to the rapid expansion of data centers throughout the state.

Developers of a controversial data center in St. Louis' historic Armory building have repeatedly said their project won't cause ""unjust"" or ""unreasonable"" electricity bill increases to Missouri residents. The same claim was made by the developers of the now-defunct 440-acre hyperscale data center in St. Charles. Consumer advocates and utility experts disagree, saying ""unjust"" and ""unreasonable"" costs are open to interpretation.

The developers are referencing terms in Missouri's recently passed SB 4, which changed numerous rules related to the state's utilities, including that utilities couldn't unjustly or unreasonably raise customers' prices because of large power users like data centers. The law, however, does not define what ""unjust"" and ""unreasonable"" mean, leaving the ultimate decision up to the state's utility regulators, which have taken a hard pro-utility position in recent years.

""The question is how much should other ratepayers be shielded from the impact of these data centers and how much demand they put on the system,"" Consumers Council of Missouri attorney John Coffman told 5 On Your Side.

""There's a hot debate going on between the utility companies with the data centers and the other parties that represent the residential customers, small businesses, other industrial customers, and all the other customer groups who don't believe that what the utilities are proposing is good enough to protect customers from paying high costs,"" Consumers Council of Missouri attorney John Coffman told 5 On Your Side. ""Our greatest fear is that Ameren Missouri will have to build another power plant, for data centers, and then those data centers either become obsolete or go out of business, leaving the rest of us to pay for that power plant.""

SB 4 also allows utility companies to charge residents for under-construction power plants, before they're even up and running. The state's ongoing push to build expensive and financially risky nuclear power plants to meet data center demand would drive up costs for residents, especially if the projected demand for data centers never shows up.",https://media.ksdk.com/assets/KSDK/images/e51eb8cb-a81d-4652-a832-df9b340ea987/20251013T160935/e51eb8cb-a81d-4652-a832-df9b340ea987_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-10-13 16:01:42.120333

When vehicle design compromises emergency exit capability, we must examine whether innovation is adequately balanced with occupant protection.”

— Michael Avanesian

LOS ANGELES, CA, UNITED STATES, October 13, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- Federal safety regulators launched an investigation into Tesla's electronic door systems following a November 2024 crash that claimed three college students' lives after they became trapped inside a Cybertruck in Piedmont, California. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) probe encompasses 174,000 Tesla Model Y vehicles amid mounting evidence of electronic door system failures.

California Personal Injury attorney Michael Avanesian of Avian Law Group states that Tesla's electronic door systems present safety concerns that prioritize technological innovation over emergency egress principles. Recent wrongful death lawsuits filed by families of 19-year-old Krysta Tsukahara (Tsukahara v. Dixon, Alameda County Superior Court) and 20-year-old Jack Nelson (Nelson v. Tesla Inc., Case No. 25CV120058, Alameda County Superior Court) allege Tesla's door design prevented their escape from the burning vehicle.

""This case demonstrates the intersection of advanced technology and fundamental safety requirements,"" said Avanesian. ""When vehicle design compromises emergency exit capability, we must examine whether innovation is adequately balanced with occupant protection.""

Federal Investigation Reveals Pattern of System Failures

NHTSA data documents more than 140 consumer complaints regarding Tesla door malfunctions across various models since 2018. The September 2025 investigation (NHTSA Investigation No. PE25-016) targets electronic door handle failures affecting Model Y vehicles, with documented cases of occupants unable to exit vehicles during emergencies.

The Cybertruck operates exclusively through electronic controls that fail when vehicles lose power during crashes. While manual releases exist, they are positioned beneath rubber mats and may be difficult to locate during emergencies, particularly for rear-seat passengers.

Tesla's design chief Franz von Holzhausen acknowledged the need for ""more intuitive door mechanisms during emergency situations"" in September 2025. The company announced plans to redesign door handles, combining electronic and manual releases.

Rising Product Liability in Electric Vehicle Sector

Tesla door defect cases emerge within escalating product liability litigation. Electric vehicle defects present unique litigation challenges. While EVs demonstrate superior fire safety statistics – 0.00044% fire rate compared to 0.1% for internal combustion vehicles – their complex electronic systems create failure modes that can impact occupant egress during emergencies.

""We are observing a shift in automotive liability as manufacturers implement sophisticated electronic systems,"" Avanesian explained. ""The legal system must address emerging risks associated with electronic vehicle technologies that may impact consumer safety.""

Regulatory Framework and International Standards

Current Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards were established before widespread electronic door system adoption and do not comprehensively address emergency egress requirements. The recently established FMVSS No. 305a focuses primarily on battery safety without comprehensive emergency escape provisions.

China has implemented stricter door handle safety requirements, mandating every door feature external mechanical handles and clearly marked internal releases positioned within 300mm of door edges. European regulators are considering restrictions on fully concealed door handles following safety concerns.

Legal Proceedings and Industry Impact

Avanesian predicts Tesla door defect cases will establish precedents for electric vehicle product liability. ""These lawsuits will determine standards for balancing design innovation with fundamental safety requirements,"" he said. ""The outcome will influence industry practices and consumer protection standards for the electric vehicle sector.""

The wrongful death lawsuits seek unspecified damages and are scheduled for trial in February 2027. Legal experts anticipate additional cases as awareness of door system failures increases among vehicle owners.

As federal investigators examine Tesla's door systems, the electric vehicle industry faces evaluation of safety standards that will determine how innovation integrates with consumer protection requirements.

The ""programmatic review"" action, quietly taken and noted in an agency website statement, followed the Trump order to freeze clean energy project permits.
Joe Lombardo (R) raised concern about economic impacts to growing industries such as data centers and mining if solar energy projects are curtailed or delayed.","Threats from the Trump administration to curtail already awarded federal funds and approvals for U.S. clean energy development have revved up in recent days—with the U.S. Interior Dept. reversing its sign-off to proceed on the 6.2-GW Esmerelda Seven solar and battery project in Nevada, while the U.S. Dept. of Energy targets hundreds of previously awarded clean energy grants worth an estimated $24 billion.

The U.S. Interior Dept. said Oct. 10 that it has cancelled a key approval for the Esmeralda Seven solar and battery project, to be located about 30 miles west of Tonopah, Nev., on public land, in an agreement with firms developing its seven contiguous sections. Together, they are set to produce 6.2 GW of clean power and be a leading energy supplier in the state. The ""programmatic review"" action, quietly taken and noted in an agency website statement, followed the Trump order to freeze clean energy project permits. Interior released the Esmeralda project draft environmental review early this year and had promised final approval, the record of decision, in July. Among key project developers are NextEra Energy, Invenergy, Leeward Energy and ConnectGen.

Interior did not cancel the entire 62,000-acre project, a department spokesperson told media, but directed developers to resubmit parcels for new approval separately “to more effectively analyze potential impacts,” if they choose to continue development.

Among developers responding to media, a NextEra Energy spokesperson said on Oct. 10 the firm was “in the early stage of development and remains committed to pursuing our project’s comprehensive environmental analysis by working closely with [the department.] A spokesperson for Leeward Energy said it had “no information to share regarding the project update.”

Among other administration rule changes mandated in July, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum has to personally approve all “environmentally damaging” solar and wind energy projects on public lands, requiring the department to consider “capacity density” when evaluating projects, which observers said could be a barrier due to their space needs.

At the same time, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said it was ending a $7 billion national program that offered states grants to develop solar energy for low-income households. In September, the U.S. Dept. of Agriculture said it would no longer fund solar projects on productive farmland, a policy change from the Biden administration.

In an Aug. 4 letter to Burgum, Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo (R) raised concern about economic impacts to growing industries such as data centers and mining if solar energy projects are curtailed or delayed. Nevada ranked fourth in the U.S. last year in total electricity generation from utility- and small-scale solar resources, comprising 31% of the state's total power generation, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Ben Norris, vice president of regulatory affairs for the Solar Energy Industries Association, said the Interior Dept. needs to further clarify “its apparent decision to abruptly cancel these solar projects in the late stages of the review process.”

Despite Esmeralda's clean energy appeal, some environmental advocates opposed it for its impacts to a pristine area. Advocacy group Basin and Range Watch and others sued Interior in May for not considering Esmeralda Seven in its environmental review of Greenlink West, a 472-mile, multibillion-dollar transmission line from the Reno area to Las Vegas to move energy from rural areas to Nevada urban centers. A spokeswoman for owner NV Energy said the utility is moving ahead to build the project.

Opponents speculated whether Esmeralda Seven's developers would actually resubmit applications after “tariffs and roadblocks set by the administration"" add new layers of complication, said one. Shaaron Netherton, executive director of Friends of Nevada Wilderness, said the cancelled review “will be an opportunity moving forward to find better sites for solar development.”

DOE Eyes Billions More in Funding Cuts

The Esmeralda reversal comes as a list developed by the U.S. Energy Dept. of hundreds of clean power project federal grant recipients that are targeted for termination became public through media pickup—possibly totaling an added $12 billion beyond $7.56 billion the agency announced earlier this month would terminate.

The group includes some 600 grant recipient names, with about half on the already announced list and total funding of nearly $24 billion according to the document. Media speculate the list was leaked, with possible intent to use the cuts as leverage.

Initiatives affected include carbon capture projects in development by ExxonMobil and Occidental as well as hundreds of millions in funding provided to electric vehicle manufacturing sites built or under construction by vehicle makers Ford Motor Co., General Motors, Stellantis and Volvo.

Canada, however, appears to be is moving to capture more carbon capture market share the U.S. may leave behind. Montreal-based technology startup Deep Sky said on Oct. 9 that it will build what it said would be one of the world’s largest direct air capture projects, an estimated $500-million plant in Manitoba. Set to start construction next year, the facility would be able to remove 500,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide annually from the atmosphere, Deep Sky said. No contractor selection was announced. ""Canada has the opportunity to become the carbon removal capital of the world, and capture the jobs and economic opportunity that will come with it,” said Alex Petre, Deep Sky CEO.

Also on the Trump agenda now are new funding cuts that could total more than $4.5 billion, to five U.S. hydrogen hubs, including those focused on deriving the fuel from natural gas, Those are: the HyVelocity hub located on the Gulf Coast; the Midwest and mid-Atlantic hubs; the Appalachian hub known as ARCH 2 in West Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania; and the Heartland hub in the Dakotas, Montana, Wisconsin and Minnesota. Burgum had supported the latter while he was North Dakota governor, while Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) previously voiced concern about potential Trump cuts to the Appalachian hub's $925 million in federal funding.

DOE officials have not officially confirmed specific cuts. ""We have been unable to verify the documents referenced. No determinations have been made other than what has been previously announced,"" DOE chief spokesperson Ben Dietderich told ENR. The agency ""continues to conduct an individualized and thorough review of financial awards made by the previous administration.""",https://www.enr.com/ext/resources/2025/10/12/BLM.ESMERALDA.-SOLARSITE.jpeg?height=635&t=1760378105&width=1200,N,,2025-10-13 15:01:52.091742

The Marine Energy Technologies Acceleration Act from Democratic Reps. Nanette Barragán of California, Suzanne Bonamici of Oregon and Chellie Pingree of Maine calls for $1 billion in investments in ocean-powered energy technologies, doled out by the Department of Energy.

Under the legislation, the DOE secretary would establish a Marine Energy Acceleration Fund to pay for new projects, research and workforce development. The fund would also seek to accelerate wave and tidal energy technologies aimed at creating clean energy and strengthening the economies of coastal areas.

“Marine energy is an essential part of America’s clean energy future,” Barragán said in a statement. “With its potential to generate reliable, zero-emission power, it can help us transition from fossil fuels and deliver clean energy directly to our communities. By investing in marine energy technologies today, we can bring wave-powered electricity onto our grid, create good jobs, and strengthen our energy independence. Now more than ever, we must accelerate clean energy innovation to cut emissions and lower costs for American families.”

The $1 billion in funding would be spread across at least 20 marine energy demonstration projects, per the bill text. Those projects would export power to microgrids, community grids or utility-scale grids.

The National Marine Energy Centers would likely be looped into the funding push, serving as consultants to the DOE secretary and providing education and training for jobs in the field. The Energy Department, meanwhile, would be charged with mapping areas that have the best potential to tap marine energy.

National laboratories and other federal agencies could also play a role in these elements of the legislation. The bill specifically calls out the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management to help DOE in assessing the economic potential of at least 50 sites identified by modeling to “have significant marine energy potential.”

The DOE secretary should prioritize R&D projects that lower costs and increase efficiency through the rapid design and testing of new marine energy systems, components and controls. Preference should also be given to technologies that monitor and lessen climate-related impacts to coastal communities.

One element of the bill that appears to have common ground with the Trump administration’s energy policy is on permitting: The bill calls for an elimination of “red tape” and a more streamlined approval process for projects.

But what will it take to tap into this substantial energy source underneath our feet that could reduce emissions and curb climate change?

Geothermal energy comes from deep within the Earth’s crust, where heat is produced by both the decay of radioactive minerals and molten rock.

This heat is key for generating electricity – usually from tapping into a hot water aquifer – which can directly heat buildings or spin a turbine’s rotor. This process emits no pollutants and, unlike solar or wind, can be available around the clock.

This type of electricity production has actually been around for a long time – getting its start over 100 years ago in areas experiencing significant subsurface geologic activity.

Tom Solomon is the head facilitator of the New Mexico Geothermal Working Group, a slew of volunteers who explore geothermal and ways that it can be brought to the state.

“New Mexico is number six in the nation in terms of its resource potential for geothermal,” Solomon said.

He’s referencing a report by Project InnerSpace, the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology and the Bureau of Geology and Mineral Resources, which singled out Santa Fe, Rio Arriba, Sandoval and Taos counties as the best candidates for geothermal exploration.

It found that New Mexico has the potential to produce 163 gigawatts of geothermal power. Just one gigawatt can power roughly 750,000 homes on average.

That power could then be sold to other states or attract private investment opportunities, such as data centers.

Solomon says New Mexico is just starting to explore this massive source of energy.

Right now, there’s only one utility-scale geothermal power plant, located in Lordsburg, and state officials in June announced a deal between Meta and XGS Energy to significantly boost the state’s geothermal output.

“The really exciting possibility is what’s called ‘advanced geothermal,’ or ‘hot dry rock geothermal,’ which New Mexico has in abundance, primarily because of the Rio Grande rift,” Solomon said.

Bisecting the state, the Rio Grande rift is a place where the earth’s crust and mantle have been stretched, thinned, and fractured by tectonic forces – pushing heat closer to the surface.

“Meaning you don’t have to drill as deep to access that really hot rock, which is the source of potential geothermal,” Solomon said.

Similar to oil and gas fracking, this method works by drilling wells into the Earth’s surface and using high-pressure water to fracture hot basement rock, creating a piping-hot reservoir.

Then, engineers can inject cold water into a well, which circulates and heats up through the hot, fractured rock, and then is brought up to the surface for use.

Wells must also be drilled very deep into the earth’s surface – sometimes 15,000 feet down. For context, the highest natural point in New Mexico is Wheeler Peak, at just over 13,000 feet.

Despite the promise of geothermal energy production, it’s been a difficult pitch to policymakers and utilities because it’s both expensive up front and the technology is rapidly evolving.

In fact, advancements in hot, dry rock geothermal are so new, experts are closely following the construction of a first-of-its-kind utility-scale project by Fervo Energy in Utah.

There, engineers are hoping to put out 100 megawatts of electricity next year, adding 400 more by the end of 2028.

The excitement surrounding advanced geothermal system research lies in the potential to drill both vertically and horizontally, allowing wells to have more contact with a geothermal source.

By doing so, power plants can be placed pretty much everywhere, and can access more heat from the same depth. Another plus: it can utilize readily available expertise from the oil and gas industry – who use a similar technique to tap fossil fuel reservoirs.

Regardless of the type of geothermal energy, the fast pace of the industry is creating some red-hot buzz in the Land of Enchantment.

“Geothermal energy will fit like a hand in a glove in New Mexico,” said Rebecca “Puck” Stair, director of the energy conservation and management division within the Energy Minerals and Natural Resources Department (EMNRD).

Stair estimates that around 40% of the state’s electricity is sourced from renewables, putting it well ahead of its self-imposed clean energy goals. To her, geothermal could fill in the remaining 60%.

“There is a possibility that we could switch our entire electric grid over to clean power fueled by solar, wind and geothermal, and the math is penciling for that,” Stair said. “And, at the same time, still be pumping oil and gas out of the Permian [Basin] for use elsewhere in other states.”

New Mexico heavily relies on the revenue generated from the oil and gas industry to prop up its economy, and is slowly diversifying its portfolio by shoring up permanent funds and investing in other industries.

In 2024, Stair and her team were tasked by the legislature to develop rules and regulations for geothermal permitting and a separate grant and loan program to help fund projects.

Her department is still drafting those rules, but Stair said these initiatives are a huge investment, because geothermal will only be possible with private-public partnerships to construct those expensive geothermal power plants.

“I think the ball is in our court right now, and we’re hopefully carrying it hard and fast,” Stair added.

Still, she hopes the state will fund mapping options to pinpoint the ideal places for geothermal, who owns that land, and nearest transmission lines to evaluate infrastructure needs.

At the Roundhouse, lawmakers continue to be enthusiastic about geothermal and say they’re open to funding more research.

“It’s a pretty win-win deal,” said State Sen. Pat Woods (R-Grady). “We’ve got the oil and gas industry that is very efficient at digging these deep wells.”

A longtime supporter of the oil and gas industry, Woods thinks that together, fossil fuels and geothermal could bring new rural jobs, but he’s not totally convinced it’s a silver bullet.

“I think it’s a hell of an idea, but it’s a ways out,” Woods said.

Woods is clear: he doesn’t want to replace oil and gas anytime soon. For now it keeps crucial dollars flowing to his constituents in the far northeastern stretch of the state.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/lordsburg-copy.jpg,N,,2025-10-13 20:02:13.791315

Try as he might, US President Donald Trump can’t stop the domestic solar industry in its tracks. Even as some high profile projects face cancellation or delay, other signs of momentum keeps surfacing. One good example consists of the nation’s water system owners and managers, who see floating solar technology as an effective means of reducing their energy costs, improving resiliency, and conserving water, too.

One Small Floating Solar Project To Rule Them All

The private research institute Nova Southeastern University is among the latest energy consumers to dip a toe in the floating solar waters. Last month, NSU announced that it is the first university in the US to bring a commercial-level floating solar system into its energy portfolio. Construction is currently underway and the system should be up and running before year’s end.

At 700 kilowatts in capacity and only two acres in size, the system is tiny compared to today’s megascale solar farms. However, it will get the job done. The new array will hook up directly to the school’s newest student housing complex, Mako Hall, where it is expected to fill a significant proportion of electricity demand.

The new NSU system demonstrates the maturing state of the floating solar supply chain, too. Floating solar is a new industry that requires specialized racks and mooring systems. As demand rises, economies of scale kick in, helping to reduce costs. The global firm Ciel & Terre supplied its Hydrelio platform for the installation, consisting of 1,200 solar panels anchored for hurricane hardiness.

Ease of installation is another feature typical of floating solar systems. They don’t require land to be cleared and leveled, which explains why NSU expects the clean kilowatts to begin flowing only 90 days or so after the start of construction (see more floating solar background here).

The system’s developer, D3Energy, also anticipates that it will be a model for other institutions that are squeezed for space. As a crowded urban campus, NSU doesn’t have much ground space, but it does include several ponds within its borders.

“This installation at NSU demonstrates how floating solar can deliver real benefits for institutions that may not have the land or rooftop space for large-scale solar,” emphasized D3’s Managing Director, Stetson Tchividjian, in a press statement.

Small Floating Solar System, Big Savings

Replacing fossil fuels in an institutional residence is just one use case with the potential for widespread adoption. Another key market consists of water treatment plants, where floating arrays can also offset a significant amount of electricity consumption. D3Energy is also active in that space.

Back in 2023 CleanTechnica caught wind of activity under way at the Signal Hill Water Treatment Plant in Utah. What makes the project particularly interesting is the water district’s choice of the leading global energy services firm Ameresco to oversee the new solar system.

“Ameresco has been working on an energy makeover for the US Department of Defense, including a new floating solar project at Fort Bragg in North Carolina,” CleanTechnica observed, taking note of potential opportunities for replication of the Signal Hill array in other Ameresco projects.

Ameresco tapped D3Energy for the solar installation, with the expectation that the system would be up and running in about 12 months. The project was completed ahead of schedule and construction was officially completed in September of 2024.

As with the NSU project, Signal Hill’s new 587.5 kilowatt array is relatively small, but it will reduce the facility’s grid energy consumption by 92% while reducing annual energy costs by 80%.

“The notion that solar panels must be installed on land is an unnecessary limitation. By reconsidering their placement, we unlock new opportunities for sustainability,” explained Ameresco EVP Lou Maltezos in a press statement marking the end of construction.

“This first-ever floating solar array in Utah is both innovative and economically feasible, making it a prime example of sustainable development,” Maltezos added.

More Solar Energy For Texas

Of course, no story about the US floating solar industry is complete without a mention of Texas, where everything is bigger, including the state’s renewable energy profile. Texas has been a perennial leader in installed wind capacity among the 50 states since the early 2000’s, and of late it has been vying with California and Florida for the #2 slot in solar.

In the latest development, last summer the leading US infrastructure and energy services firm Diamond Infrastructure Solutions tapped the Texas company Third Pillar Solar to install floating solar systems on its portfolio of reservoirs in Texas.

As described by Third Pillar, the first-of-its-kind collaboration represents the largest collection of floating solar projects in all three Americas. The number of projects will depend Third Pillar’s site assessments, but the company already anticipates that the agreement will launch up to 500 megawatts’ worth of solar capacity. The new systems will provide Diamond and its clients with the extra benefit of conserving water — and money — that would otherwise be lost to evaporation.

“The comprehensive floating solar initiative represents a potential investment exceeding $700 million and is expected to generate up to 500MW of clean energy — all while minimizing land development and helping conserve approximately 15% of freshwater currently lost to evaporation in a fast-growing, water-stressed region,” Third Pillar notes.

Third Pillar CEO Jaimeet Gulati also chipped in his two cents in a press statement, drawing attention to the multiple benefits of floating solar arrays. “This agreement demonstrates the growing appetite for utility-scale energy solutions and highlights how floating solar can enhance and transform the value of existing infrastructure, all while providing cost-competitive energy, preserving agricultural land, reducing evaporation losses, and existing out of public view,” Gulati said.

Once again illustrating the rapid timeline for floating solar projects, Third Pillar plans to have all of the projects in service before 2030 rolls around.

Regardless of the current state of federal energy policy, Third Pillar is loaded for bear. The company is focusing its floating solar business on the nation’s vast array of wastewater lagoons and reclaimed sand and gravel pits, alongside industrial reservoirs. With the financial backing of majority owner Glentra Capital, Third Pillar already claims more than 5 gigawatts in its portfolio, with another 60 deployments coming through its 11-state project pipeline.

More Green Jobs For A Job-Thirsty Nation

Speaking of federal energy policy, it’s a mystery why US President Donald Trump has chosen, out of all the abundant energy options spread across the land, to tamp down access to the nation’s most abundant, accessible, and inexpensive resource, namely, wind and solar energy.

After all the President’s “American Energy Dominance” plan explicitly calls upon federal resources to support other renewables, including biomass, hydropower, and geothermal. The Energy Department is also continuing to fund the development of marine energy harvesting devices, even though the domestic marine industry — wave, currents, and tides — is years away from achieving commercial uptake to any significant degree.

The $4-billion project, still in early planning, would link the Yukon’s isolated energy system to the Western continental grid at Bob Quinn Lake, B.C.

If built, the Yukon-B.C. grid connect could generate up to $7.6 billion annually in long-term economic benefits, support 36,000 jobs over 50 years and help replace nearly five million litres of diesel fuel each year in six northern communities, according to the report.

The Yukon currently operates on a stand-alone power system, relying mostly on hydroelectricity, diesel generators and liquefied natural gas. The proposed 765-kilometre transmission line would be the territory’s first connection to the broader North American grid, improving energy reliability.

The project took a step forward on May 23, when former Yukon premier Ranj Pillai and B.C. premier David Eby signed a memorandum of understanding to guide early-stage planning.

According to YDC’s report released Oct. 1, the transmission line could unlock 2,000 megawatts of renewable energy potential, enough to generate $2 billion in annual clean electricity revenue. It could also support electrification of homes and vehicles, helping stabilize electricity supply and make clean energy more accessible in remote communities.

Mineral-rich regions in the Yukon and B.C. could unlock an estimated $181.2 billion in growth to the mining sector, especially for deposits considered critical to Canada’s technology, defence and clean energy sectors. The report estimates the project could displace up to nine million tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions annually, roughly 1.3 per cent of Canada’s total emissions.

Increased energy capacity in the Yukon could attract major investment in the mining sector and reduce reliance on diesel, the report says.

The transmission line would cross First Nations lands and YDC says reconciliation is a guiding principle in its planning. The report highlights opportunities for Indigenous ownership and leadership in energy development, describing the project as a “nation-building” initiative.

YDC has begun energy planning discussions with Yukon First Nations, aiming to move the Yukon-B.C. grid connect project forward together. A connected grid could reduce investment risk and support Indigenous-led renewable energy projects.

Beyond energy, the Yukon-B.C. grid connect project could pave investment in roads, telecommunications and industrial facilities. The report cites $200 million in upgrades to transportation networks across northern B.C. and the Yukon as a potential benefit.

Reliable electricity is also a key part of Canada’s northern defence strategy. The report cites the Assembly of First Nations and defence experts as supporting energy infrastructure upgrades to bolster Arctic sovereignty and critical minerals development.

The project remains in the pre-feasibility stage, backed by $40 million from Canada’s Critical Mineral Infrastructure Fund and $13 million from the YDC Fund.

No final route has been selected, but two options are under review, one connecting Bob Quinn Lake to Ross River via the Robert Campbell Highway and another linking Bob Quinn Lake to Whitehorse via the Alaska Highway.

The company, PSEG Renewable Transmission, is opposing a procedural schedule issued by the Maryland Public Service Commission, which plans to review the project until at least February 2027.

PSEG argues that the commission’s schedule will make it impossible to reach a deadline for placing the power line in service by June 2027, which was set by the operator of the region’s electric grid, PJM Interconnection.

“PJM set the in-service date to prevent specific impending reliability violations,” wrote PSEG attorney J. Joseph Curran, III, in a letter to the commission. “Unless these violations are addressed, PJM has determined that overall system reliability in the PJM region — including in Maryland — could be compromised, and the PJM region could be exposed to widespread and extreme conditions, such as system collapse and blackouts.”

The commission, by contrast, has expressed confidence that the electric grid will remain well-managed while it deliberates about the transmission line.

US marshals won’t be used for protection during Maryland power line surveys — for now

In his letter to the commission, Curran also requested that it establish a target date to issue a final order on the Maryland Piedmont Reliability Project, as the power line project is known. An end date would help the company more efficiently coordinate with other state and federal permitting agencies, plan construction activities, and negotiate with landowners, he wrote.

But in a statement Friday, Tori Leonard, a spokesperson for the commission, said it is “unlikely” to place an end cap on the proceedings by setting a target date for a final order. The commission’s schedule ends in February 2027 with a deadline for the parties to submit their final briefs.

The commission will ultimately decide whether the controversial power line receives a “Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity,” authorizing its construction. But the process has already been mired in delays, largely because of intense pushback from landowners in the line’s path, and other community members and elected officials in the impacted jurisdictions.

Because of landowner denials, PSEG had to go to court to get a federal district judge to order temporary access to hundreds of properties for environmental surveys, which it will need in order to get a final ruling from the commission.

Those surveys are well underway, though landowners have appealed. On Thursday, the company filed suit against a third round of defiant landowners, requesting access to 64 additional parcels.

By comparison, in his Oct. 7 letter, Curran said the company has obtained voluntary access agreements for 52 parcels along the proposed route.

The proposed line would stretch 67 miles through largely rural areas in Baltimore, Carroll and Frederick counties, connecting a power substation near the Pennsylvania line with a substation in Frederick County.

The project was commissioned by grid operator PJM alongside a host of other projects meant to relieve problems in a strained grid, caused in part by the rise of energy-intensive data centers and expected retirements of fossil fuel generating stations.

In a statement shortly after the Maryland Commission issued its schedule for the Piedmont line, PJM spokesman Jeff Shields said that “PJM has identified extensive, severe, and widespread reliability violations that PJM expects to occur as soon as June 2027 if these projects are not built on the prescribed schedule, leaving the entire system more exposed to reliability risks, including power outages.”

Shields noted that Maryland will be “additionally challenged to meet local demand from local sources” given the planned retirements of the Brandon Shores and Wagner power plants, which are currently operating solely because of “must run” agreements with the grid.

In its news release announcing the scheduling order on Sept. 11, the commission highlighted that PSEG submitted its application for the certification in late December 2024, as opposed to fall 2024 as planned.

In his letter to the commission, Curran pushed back, arguing that the New-Jersey based power company only submitted in December because it decided to conduct additional public hearings in November 2024.

In requesting an end date for the proceedings, Curran argued that it would help expedite the permits that PSEG would likely only be able to obtain after a decision on the certificate of public convenience, including from the Army Corps of Engineers, the Maryland Department of the Environment, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the impacted counties.

The Rise of Data Centers and Electricity Demands on Virginia, Ohio, and North Carolina

By Jason E. Wandling

Data centers have generated unprecedented controversy across the country over the past two years, but have attracted the most attention in Virginia, North Carolina, and Ohio. Each of those states is currently experiencing a strong surge in electricity demand driven by the expansion of data centers, which has caused consternation among existing power utility customers and their new neighbors. This piece examines the experiences of data centers in each of those states.

In Virginia, Dominion Energy projects about a 5 percent annual increase in peak power demand over the next 15 years, a fact which runs up hard against constraints established by the Virginia Clean Economy Act (VCEA), which requires Dominion to be carbon-free by 2045 and sets limits on building new fossil-fuel plants unless certain efficiency thresholds are met. Pursuant to the VCEA, utilities must also show that any fossil-fuel-based solution is more cost-effective than clean alternatives.

Dominion Energy’s proposal to construct a new, 944 MW natural gas “peaker” plant in Chesterfield County to meet demand has brought this issue to the forefront. Peaker plants are designed to run only during high-demand periods, and Dominion argues this plant is the best and necessary solution to avoid reliability issues.

Clean energy advocates and other stakeholders argue Dominion did not adequately consider cleaner alternatives such as battery storage, grid-enhancing technologies, virtual power plants, or demand flexibility and have challenged Dominion’s modeling, cost comparisons, and assumptions. These critics contend that the analyses are biased toward the outcome of building the gas plant.

Likewise, the Virginia State Corporation Commission’s (SCC) staff has raised doubts about whether the Chesterfield plant is indeed the best or only viable path forward. They noted that Dominion’s economic impact study didn’t show large benefits, pointed out gaps in reliability studies, and criticized Dominion for not having developed cleaner dispatchable options earlier. Ultimately, however, staff did not formally oppose the plant, suggesting that with existing demand growth, regulators may see few alternatives. Public comments and hearings are ongoing.

Tension is increasing between the need to meet reliability goals while achieving the VCEA’s decarbonization requirements. Moreover, ratepayers such as residential consumers and existing businesses and industry may end up bearing the costs of constructing electrical grid infrastructure necessary to support the continued growth of data centers in Virginia.

Those tensions have begun to express themselves in the run-up to the November 2025 Virginia elections because voters are increasingly concerned about rising electricity bills and the strain on the grid that is particularly driven by growth in AI and data centers. Residents and existing businesses and industries are worried not just about high utility rates, but also about whether local power transmission infrastructure can handle surging demand without failure.

As Axios reported, former state lawmaker and director of Virginia's Department of Energy Glenn Davis said, ""This is the first time I've really seen energy as part of the conversation during election season.” The concerns have been so pronounced that Amazon Web Services withdrew a plan for a data center in Louisa County, specifically citing community opposition. For Virginians, the issue of data centers and the construction of power plants to support them will continue to loom large.

North Carolina faces the same debate. Data centers are multiplying in North Carolina, driven especially by demand for AI and cloud computing. The growth is creating large, new electricity loads that Duke Energy projects will require adding nearly 6 GW of capacity to meet, nearly double the 3.9 GW it predicted just last year. Like in Virginia, regulators and stakeholders are questioning how to meet that demand while maintaining the clean-energy and decarbonization goals of North Carolina House Bill 951. Duke Energy’s solution is to build a fleet of new gas power plants. Clean energy advocates argue for alternatives like solar and large battery storage. Many critics argue that the proposed data centers may not materialize. And just as in Virginia, a key issue is who will pay for improvements to the electrical grid.

The North Carolina Utilities Commission (prompted in part by filings from environmental nongovernmental organizations like The Southern Environmental Law Center) has begun to dig into questions of large-loads, how to plan for them, and what rules should govern them. Meanwhile, Amazon Web Services has slated a $10 billion, 800-acre campus east of Charlotte for construction, while both Apple and Microsoft have large data centers planned for the areas west of the city as part of a “data center corridor.”

Unsurprisingly, the same issues are being raised in Ohio, where the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO) has approved a new tariff requested by AEP Ohio (the investor utility providing electric service in the greater Columbus area) that requires large data centers to pay differently for electricity. Several major tech/data center-industry players, including Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft, alongside the Ohio Manufacturers Association, challenged the proposal, but PUCO denied their appeal.

According to the PUCO ruling, data centers will be charged a minimum of 85 percent of their projected usage, even if actual usage falls below that level. The plan includes a “load-ramp” requirement pursuant to which data centers must gradually come up to their full load, rather than immediate full demand. There is also an exit fee if a data center cancels its project or cannot meet its contractual obligations.

AEP Ohio argued that its system is under strain due to surging energy demand from data center projects. In central Ohio alone, AEP Ohio noted large signed capacity agreements to meet new data center load, plus many more proposed projects. The purpose is to ensure that the infrastructure and grid upgrades necessitated by new, large loads are paid for by the data center operators who create the demand, rather than being funded disproportionately by residential customers and existing businesses and industrial users.

Opponents, including The Data Center Coalition and some manufacturers, argue the new tariff is discriminatory and may overcharge data centers. They say the utility’s demand forecasts might be speculative or overstated. The Ohio Manufacturers’ Association has said it will appeal to the Supreme Court of Ohio, seeing PUCO’s decision as unfair to high-energy industrial users.

Some see a potential solution to at least some of these issues in microgrids. A microgrid is a small network of electricity users with a local source of supply that may be attached to a centralized national grid, but which is able to function independently. Microgrids are becoming more relevant and necessary, not just for data centers but broadly across commercial, industrial, mission-critical, and even community/residential sectors. For instance, West Virginia passed a bill during the 2025 legislative session that created a structure to allow the construction of industrial microgrids that may alleviate some of the pressures on the larger electrical grid. Microgrid legislation is sure to be a live issue in most state legislatures during the coming years.

While Virginia, North Carolina, and Ohio have been at the forefront on data center development issues, we are seeing data center development occurring around the country. Similarly, we are also seeing state regulators and legislators around the country grapple with how best to facilitate the growth of data centers and AI while also protecting existing customers. While there is currently no clear path forward, there is no doubt that these issues will continue to be top of mind.

Mountain Valley Pipeline Asks Intermediate Court of Appeals to Return Protest Lawsuit to Circuit Court

“The suit alleges that Martha Ann Zinn, the respondent in the first suit, attached herself to a piece of drilling equipment being used to construct the pipeline, and Mary Beth Naim, Judy Kay Smucker, and Jessica Grim blocked an access road.”

Why this is important: During the construction of the Mountain Valley Pipeline, protestors impeded drilling and blocked access to the construction area. In response, the article points out that Mountain Valley Pipeline filed two separate lawsuits against the protestors alleging trespass, tortious interference, civil conspiracy, and violations of the Critical Infrastructure Protection Act. The Circuit Court ultimately dismissed both cases, ruling that Mountain Valley Pipeline did not possess enforceable property rights under the easement granted for pipeline installation. Mountain Valley Pipeline appealed the decision to the West Virginia Intermediate Court of Appeals. Oral arguments were heard on September 16, 2025. The appeal raises a central legal question: whether an easement holder, right-of-way holder, or license holder has a legally protectable interest in the property they are authorized to use. --- Taiesha K. Morgan

UK-US Nuclear Deal: What does It Mean and will It Really Lead to a ‘Golden Age’?

“Starmer announced multibillion-pound link-up to build ‘mini-nukes’ likely to be signed during Trump visit.”

Why this is important: British Prime Minister Starmer recently announced a $100 billion partnership with the United States for five nuclear deals to build a fleet of Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) and Advanced Modular Reactors (AMRs) in the UK. While there have been encouraging agreements and developments toward additional SMR capacity in recent years that have not been realized, this new round of cooperation between the UK and the U.S., despite traditional obstacles, may signal a significant step in reversing that trend as these projects are actually starting to move forward. This, in turn, could portend similar positive nuclear development outside of the UK. --- Barry A. Naum

IAEA Again Raises Global Nuclear Power Projections

“Noting recent momentum behind nuclear power, the International Atomic Energy Agency has revised up its projections for the expansion of nuclear power, estimating that global nuclear operational capacity will more than double by 2050—reaching 2.6 times the 2024 level—with small modular reactors expected to play a pivotal role in this high-case scenario.”

Why this is important: The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has revised its nuclear power capacity projections and now reports an estimated increase in nuclear capacity by 2050 of well over 100 percent from 2024 levels. As stated by IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi, “Nuclear power is indispensable for achieving clean, reliable and sustainable energy for all.” Despite this truth, as of 2024, nuclear generation comprised only 8.7 percent of global electricity production. Therefore, if these high-end projections are accurate, such an increase in available nuclear capacity could provide a promising partial solution to the astronomical electricity demands expected in the near future as a result of data centers and other advanced technologies, coupled with the ongoing retirement of “fossil fuel” generation. Still, as considered and discussed by IAEA, a number of critical improvements in national policies, investment, and workforce development must occur in order to obtain the highest projections. --- Barry A. Naum

Natural Gas to Dominate U.S., China and India's Energy Mix By 2050

“The report says that scalability and commercial challenges are the biggest obstacles that will hinder a direct shift from coal to renewables, making natural gas a critical bridge in the global energy transition.”

Why this is important: S&P Global Commodity Insights predicts natural gas is the only fossil fuel likely to grow in the generation mix of the United States, China, and India by 2050. In the next 25 years, S&P Global sees renewables – solar and wind principally – only growing by 4 percent to 20 percent. Gas is the only fossil fuel expected to increase in all three of the world’s largest countries. Currently, coal-to-gas substitution has driven the energy transition in the U.S., Europe, and Southeast Asia. However, in the midst of these transitions, new reserves of fossil fuels are being confirmed. India still relies heavily on oil for its energy needs, and last year, four new basins predicted to have 22 billion barrels of recoverable crude oil were confirmed in the world’s second largest country. That amount is more oil than is left in the U.S. Permian Basin, which has produced 14 billion of its 34 billion barrels of recoverable oil. --- Mark E. Heath

Which Form of Energy is the Cheapest? CBS News Asked the Experts to Find Out.

“In the U.S., where energy policy has been shaped by politics for more than a century, the battle continues to play out at the highest levels of government.”

Why this is important: Per the article, CBS relied on the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) in determining which electricity sources are most cost-effective. That’s fine as far as it goes, but it’s only half the story. A fair comparison arguably also considers the Levelized Avoided Cost of Energy (LACE), which measures the value of that energy source to the grid. It involves comparing the cost of the energy produced to the cost of the energy source it would replace, and takes into account factors like the inherent intermittency of wind and solar. If a project’s LACE exceeds its LCOE, it has value to the grid. In many cases, a power source might generate electricity at the lowest price per kilowatt, but be less valuable to the grid because its power isn’t available and can’t be dispatched when needed. --- David L. Yaussy

Morrisey Shares New Energy Plan for WV, Relying Heavily on Coal, Natural Gas to Grow Power Creation

“The plan — dubbed the ‘50 by 50’ generation plan by Morrisey — aims to see the state increase its power capacity from the current 15 gigawatt generating capacity to 50 gigawatts by 2050.”

Why this is important: As detailed in the article, West Virginia’s Governor has announced a plan to more than triple the state’s electric power production capability within the next 25 years, in part as an aspiration to address the regional and national need for more power to meet demand associated with data center development and other energy-intensive formats. As described in the article, this ambitious plan specifically targets development of more fossil-fuel based power plants in the state, but downplays the viability of renewable power development. What remains unclear is who would build these new plants and who will bear the cost. On its face, the plan does little for existing West Virginia power consumers who have faced significant price increases over the last 15 years, particularly existing manufacturing and industrial companies that have already invested millions of dollars in West Virginia. Uncertainty also exists with respect to the proposed timeline; major fossil-fuel power plant development takes several years, and the plan would seemingly require that well more than a dozen such plants be built and energized within a relatively short period. Notwithstanding those key concerns, the plan certainly engages West Virginia’s place as an energy state and net exporter of power. --- Derrick Price Williamson

Which Countries Buy the Most U.S. Coal?

“The U.S. exported 97.6M tonnes of coal in 2024, representing 25% of its domestic coal production.”

Why this is important: Almost 25 percent of the coal mined in the U.S. is now exported. Data from the U.S. Energy Information Agency shows that in 2024, the United States exported 97.6 metric tons of coal (108 million U.S. tons). Fifty-seven percent of all exports went to five countries: 1) India, 23 percent at 22.9 million tons; 2) China, 12 percent at 11.3 million tons; 3) Japan, 8 percent at 8.2 million tons; 4) Brazil, 7 percent at 7.6 million tons; and 5) the Netherlands, 7 percent at 7.6 million tons. Since 2017, as European consumption has declined, Asia has become the largest U.S. market. The closest export market is Canada, which imported 3.9 percent of U.S. coal exported, at 3.8 million tons. As U.S. coal-fired plants have closed, the share of exported coal has replaced U.S. consumption of steam coal. --- Mark E. Heath

China Keeps Tight Grip on Rare Earths, Costing at Least One Company ‘Millions of Euros’

“The chamber also called on China to address several pain points for businesses as the country prepares its next five-year plan.”

Why this is important: The article reflects that amid ongoing trade tensions between China and several major economies, China has begun limiting foreign access to rare earth elements that are vital for technologies such as electric vehicles, semiconductors, medical imaging, and advanced defense systems. This shift coincides with global policy discussions addressing concerns about the environmental and economic impacts of overproduction in rare earth mining. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, China accounted for over 69 percent of global rare earth element mine production in 2024 and holds nearly half of the world’s known reserves. Recent Chinese export restrictions include the issuance of single-use export licenses and requirements that buyers certify the materials will not be used for military purposes.

The article points out that while some companies, such as Volkswagen, report stable supply chains, others claim to have been adversely affected by the new regulations. A member of an unnamed 25-year-old business stated they lost millions of euros due to increased regulation. A study by the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai found that several companies have shifted planned investments away from China to other Southeast Asian nations in response to these changes. In an effort to address concerns, organizations like the European Chamber of Commerce have engaged in discussions with China’s Ministry of Commerce to advocate for more predictable access to rare earth materials.

This is important because, as China’s leadership prepares to outline future strategies for rare earth resource management, global policymakers are expected to monitor developments closely due to the significant role these materials play in the global economy. --- Taiesha K. Morgan

Pa. Electric Customers will Pay to Keep an Old Power Plant Running Under Federal Orders

“The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) approved a plan that allows PJM Interconnection to recover its payments to the plant’s owner, Constellation Energy, from electricity users across its 13-state territory.”

Why this is important: The Trump administration’s Department of Energy has taken an aggressive approach with respect to fossil fuel plant retirements, exercising its authority to foreclose scheduled retirements of old, arguably uneconomic natural gas and coal-fired power plants. As noted in the article, DOE ordered one such plant owned by Constellation Energy in Pennsylvania (and another in Michigan) to remain operational, but extending the life of a plant that may not be actively dispatched except in more extreme or emergency conditions causes a cost, and that cost must be recovered. The article explains that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has approved a plan that would allow those costs to be recovered from all electric consumers in the “PJM” footprint, which includes Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and 11 other states in the region. The article captures that although existing fossil fuel-based power plants that can operate economically in the wholesale market for power on a daily basis are important for the power grid, federal policies that mandate the continued operation of uneconomic plants have cost consequences that will adversely impact consumers. --- Derrick Price Williamson

Virginia Energy Groups Urge State to Fight Federal Solar Grant Termination

“About half of Virginia households were expected to qualify for Solar For All, which sought to reduce energy bills by making solar power more affordable.”

Why this is important: The Commonwealth of Virginia is trying to figure out how to move forward after they had a $156 million grant cut after the Big Beautiful Bill was passed by Congress. The grant was a part of Biden administration's Inflation Reduction Act. The article explains that the grant was going to be utilized for the upfront costs of installing solar panels on low to moderate income homes as part of a Solar For All plan. By installing solar panels and making solar power more accessible, the policy was intended to decrease the cost of energy bills. While solar energy is cheap to produce, the cost to install panels can range from $15,000 to $30,000, which is more than middle class and low-income families can spare for solar energy. Per the article, leaders of the Solar For All council are urging state leaders like Governor Glenn Youngkin to fight against the grant cut given preliminary state spending for the project and a plan to install panels on more than 15,000 homes, apartment buildings, and multi-family units. The impact will not only be on those who were to receive the solar panels on their homes, but also on those in the local solar power industry, who were anticipating the addition of about 1,000 jobs to the local solar industry in Virginia.

This is an important reflection of policy changes being implemented by the Trump administration – reducing or eliminating funding for renewable projects while attempting to support a commitment to further other energy sources like coal, oil, and gas. Questions also arise about whether the federal government has breached a legal obligation that Virginia relied on and if the Commonwealth has grounds to challenge the decision under administrative law in order to obtain the resources to finish the solar project. --- Nicholas A. Muto

New EIA Study Shows that CO2 Emissions have Declined 30 Percent Since 2005

“Over that time, total energy-related CO2 emissions in the United States fell 20 percent while the population grew by 14 percent.”

Why this is important: The total per-capita CO2 emissions in the U.S. are down 30 percent since 2005, according to the U.S. Energy Information Agency. In fact, CO2 emissions are down in every state, and the total U.S. drop of 20 percent of total CO2 emissions occurred while the U.S. population grew by 14 percent. EIA attributes the drop to less coal-fired generation, increases in solar and wind generation, and increases in gas-fired electrical generation. However, for 2025, the U.S. EIA sees a one percent increase in total CO2 emissions. Electric power generation was the greatest CO2 generator in 18 states, and five states – West Virginia, Wyoming, Kentucky, Missouri, and North Dakota -- generated half their electricity from burning coal. --- Mark E. Heath

America's Power Grid is No Match for the AI Data Center Boom

“Data center demand for computing facilities that can consume as much power as entire cities, but America's electrical grid is struggling to keep pace.”

Why this is important: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is not new, but it has certainly taken center stage in national energy production and development discussions. The article amplifies that it is no surprise that the U.S. energy grid is old and in need of serious renovation. In addition to current development and consumer needs, AI centers are requesting and requiring a range of multiple gigawatts of power. Some analysts estimate that trillions of dollars are likely to be invested between now and 2030, with as much as $3 trillion by 2028. A key roadblock is the access to fundamental components needed for infrastructure upgrades, such as transformers. With supply chain delays, resource market fluctuation, and the ever-increasing competition from multiple market sources, the increased demand on the grid is also creating delays in the development of other legitimate projects because of the backlog of planned but possibly hypothetical AI data projects. Acres of space, gigawatts of power, and potential environmental consequences are the holy trinity of the AI frenzy. How the grid will sustain itself and expand to meet these demands is yet to be determined. --- Sophia L. Hines

New EV Battery Tech could Power 500-Mile Road Trips on a 12-Minute Charge

“An EV battery breakthrough from Korea could help give lithium-metal tech the green light.”

Why this is important: It seems like battery innovations are announced daily. This new discovery involves a new electrolyte that reduces dendrite formation, a common battery killer, which allows faster charging. Assuming that it can be produced cost-effectively, the article says that the battery would allow for charging to a 500-mile range in 12 minutes, which could be a key factor in convincing internal combustion engine owners to switch to electric vehicles. Charging so much, so fast would also require a huge electricity draw. Large supercharger stations with such fast charging could have the intermittent power demand of a small city, and require liquid-cooled charging cables. --- David L. Yaussy

Wind Turbine Market to Hit $325.6 B by 2034

“For example, Europe added more than 18 GW of wind energy in 2023 and will install 200 GW of new wind capacity from 2024–2030 to meet its climate energy targets.”

Why this is important: The global wind turbine market in 2024 was valued at $151.8 billion. Analysts are predicting it will more than double to $325.6 billion by 2034. The increases are driven by offshore wind and the general growth in renewables. In the next six years, Europe will add 200 GW of wind generation, which will lead to robust growth in the industry. The U.S. wind generation is predicted to grow by $3.4 billion by 2034. --- Mark E. Heath

Nuclear energy has moved from being a quiet constant to the centerpiece of a global race. Nations increasingly recognize that sovereignty—economic, technological, and cultural—depends on securing clean, stable, and independent sources of power.

COMMENTARY

Myrto Tripathi, who has spent years advancing nuclear in Europe, put it plainly when speaking to Phil Zeringue on The Future of Nuclear Energy Podcast: “Energy is the great enabler—it empowers people to make their own choices, to feed, cure, and house themselves, but also to respect the limits of our planet.”

Europe’s Lesson: Sovereignty through Nuclear

France’s reliance on nuclear power is no accident. Tripathi points back to the founding of the European Union:

“The founding fathers of the European Union bound themselves through nuclear power because it was seen as a source of peace and prosperity.”

For France and Europe, nuclear energy is not just an energy choice—it is a guarantor of independence as it pertains to political and economic terms.

That lesson resonates today, as Europe grapples with energy shocks and geopolitical threats. Nuclear remains the only scalable pathway that preserves both sovereignty and security.

U.S. Momentum and Market Leadership

The U.S. is showing renewed signs of momentum. A leading example comes from Texas, where Reed Clay, President of the Texas Nuclear Alliance, helped drive landmark legislation.

House Bill 14 established a dedicated nuclear office, created a streamlined permitting process, and allocated nearly half a billion dollars to attract investment.

“There’s a sense of urgency. If we don’t succeed now—if we don’t capitalize on the market forces and public support we have today—we may not get another opportunity,” said Clay.

This state-level leadership illustrates how the U.S. can reassert itself not only to secure energy reliability and economic growth, but to position itself in the global contest for influence.

What’s at Stake: China, AI, and Geopolitical Power

The contest is not limited to energy supply. It is about who will control the infrastructure underpinning the next industrial revolution: artificial intelligence. Data centers are projected to double electricity consumption by 2030. Only nuclear power can deliver the clean, always-on power they require.

China recognizes this. Beijing is building reactors at an unmatched pace, exporting nuclear capacity while bundling AI and digital infrastructure under its Belt and Road Initiative. This strategy links nuclear energy with technological dominance and geopolitical leverage.

Tripathi warns, “Nuclear sits at the nexus between human development and climate. Without it, nations risk being dependent on others for the most basic of needs.”

Clay echoes the strategic risk: “We can’t let Russia and China become the world’s exporters of nuclear energy. The U.S. has the resources, the will, and the track record to lead this race.”

And as Zeringue underscores, “Nuclear isn’t just about power plants—it’s about national security, economic stability, and the ability to stand independent in a rapidly changing world. The race is global, and the clock is ticking.”

The Path Forward

From Paris, to Washington, D.C., to Beijing, the message is converging. Nuclear energy is no longer a side conversation in climate or industrial policy. It is the central contest for sovereignty, security, and survival in the twenty-first century.

Tripathi calls it the enabler of dignity, prosperity, and development. Clay calls it the foundation of America’s competitive future. Zeringue calls it the cornerstone of national security.

The nuclear race is underway, and the stakes could not be higher. If democratic nations fail to lead, they risk becoming buyers rather than builders in the nuclear-AI economy. The question is not whether nuclear will define the future, but who will control it.",https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/nuclear-mirion-technologies.png,N,,2025-10-13 16:02:32.735359

A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for the proposed investment was signed with Gujarat government at the Vibrant Gujarat Regional Conference (VGRC) held at Mehsana.

Kalathia told pv magazine that the planned investments will focus on critical areas of India’s solar module manufacturing ecosystem, as well as accelerating the nation’s solar adoption journey. A significant portion of these investments will go toward strengthening R&D capabilities to enhance module efficiency and minimize cell-to-module (CTM) losses, thereby enabling project developers to achieve higher electricity generation per unit of land utilization.

Another major area of investment will be the expansion of world-class manufacturing facilities and quality assurance laboratories to improve the reliability and performance testing of solar modules. While approximately 8–10% of the investments will be directed toward R&D and manufacturing, the larger share will be dedicated to developing high-performance Renewable Energy Parks that will generate clean power for Gujarat over the next three decades and beyond. These integrated RE parks will also promote the synergistic use of solar power with other clean energy sources such as green hydrogen, paving the way for a truly futuristic and sustainable energy ecosystem.

“These planned investments not only reflect our confidence in Gujarat’s renewable energy growth story but also mark a significant step in our broader commitment to India’s clean energy transition. We look forward to replicating such high-impact investments across other states with the support of respective governments, thereby contributing meaningfully to a Cleaner and Greener India,” said Kalathia. “These initiatives are expected to create thousands of direct and indirect employment opportunities and help build a skilled workforce to drive India’s renewable energy growth story forward.”

Kosol Energie is an Indian solar EPC and module manufacturing company, delivering end-to-end solutions across utility-scale, commercial & industrial (C&I), residential, and agricultural segments.

The facility is set to become a live testing environment for over 40 distinct sustainability strategies, which could provide a blueprint for integrating sustainable practices into logistics and industrial buildings without disrupting core business operations.

Kara Hurst, Amazon’s Chief Sustainability Officer, says: “In climate action, we need to move fast. So, our teams got creative and asked: ‘What if we created a real-world testing ground for some of the best sustainability initiatives in one place?’ That's exactly what we did at DII5 our brand-new mass timber delivery station in Elkhart, Indiana.”

Mass timber and lowering embodied carbon

The DII5 facility, designed by ZGF Architects, was constructed primarily from mass timber.

According to Amazon, the building is ""the first large-scale owner-occupied mass timber logistics facility in the United States"".

The construction used Southern Yellow Pine cross-laminated timber (CLT) panels, glulam beams and wood fibre insulation.

The use of mass timber in construction can lower a building's embodied carbon compared to traditional materials like steel and concrete.

A testbed for sustainable innovation

The facility is designed to prove that sustainability can be integrated without compromising operational efficiency.

Amazon aims to use the findings from the test centre to scale sustainable projects.

Kara explains: “Buildings account for 40% of greenhouse gas emissions globally, and with that in mind, we designed DII5 to be a working laboratory with dozens of solutions – from the walls, water and lighting to the desks where our employees work. The data we are gathering will help us determine which technologies and initiatives can be scaled across our global operations.

Scaling future and existing assets

Amazon will track a range of data points to assess the viability of these strategies for wider implementation.

""By testing several sustainability initiatives under one roof, we're accelerating our progress toward achieving scalability and standardisation of these initiatives across our building portfolio,"" says Daniel Mallory, VP of Global Realty at Amazon.

Daniel explains that the facility also serves as a ""'test and learn' platform for Amazon and the broader industry to explore how buildings can become more adaptive, high-performing and resilient in a changing climate. The lessons we learn here will guide the future design, construction and operation of our spaces.""

He says Amazon will track ""multiple metrics, including total embodied carbon reduction compared to conventional construction, operational energy efficiency, water conservation performance, impacts of biodiversity and other metrics. We're also studying how the building performs in various weather conditions and monitoring construction and operational costs to assess the business case for scaling these approaches.""

The insights gained from the Indiana warehouse are not just for future constructions.

The project is intended to generate a catalogue of proven retrofittable solutions for Amazon's existing portfolio of buildings, making the facility a strategic tool for decarbonising a vast real estate footprint.

""While we view DII5 as a strategic investment in designing and implementing sustainability strategies in our future building design, it will also give us an opportunity to test which of these initiatives can be scaled across our existing building portfolio,"" says Daniel.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/ba9d63b9b3e769bb0963b8213e014e54:03227ffc75f56270b4708a62126f729f/testing1.png.jpg,N,,2025-10-13 14:02:23.084781

Forever War, Part 1: This story is published in partnership with The Assembly and with WHQR, a nonprofit radio station and NPR affiliate in Wilmington. It is the first in a series of stories about the PFAS crisis in North Carolina.

OAK ISLAND, N.C.—Emily Donovan stood before 100 people in the pews at Ocean View United Methodist Church in a small seaside town in Brunswick County, North Carolina. It was May, the start of beach season. She had invited a scientist to speak about the astronomical levels of PFAS—nicknamed “forever chemicals”—that had been detected in sea foam four miles away.

But before she began her presentation, Donovan, a co-founder of Clean Cape Fear, had to deliver some bad news. That morning, Lee Zeldin, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency administrator appointed by President Donald Trump, had announced his intention to rescind drinking water regulations for several types of PFAS compounds.

The rollbacks included GenX, one of dozens that have contaminated the region’s drinking water and have been linked to disorders of the liver, kidneys and the immune system, as well as low birth weight and cancer.

Donovan felt devastated and enraged.

“Churches in Brunswick County baptize their babies in PFAS-contaminated tap water,” Donovan told the crowd. “We fought so hard. And now our hard work is getting rolled back.”

In 2013, scientists first discovered several types of PFAS in the Lower Cape Fear River, the drinking water source for several utilities in the region. The insidious chemicals were eluding traditional water treatment systems and flowing through the taps of hundreds of thousands of people.

The scientists traced many of the compounds to Chemours’ Fayetteville Works plant, 80 miles upstream. State and federal documents show that for 40 years Chemours and its predecessor, DuPont had been quietly tainting the drinking water of a half-million North Carolinians with high levels of toxic PFAS.

It took several years for that information to reach the public, but once it did, Donovan and her fellow environmental activists, as well as public interest lawyers, state legislators and local residents, started urging the EPA and the N.C. Department of Environmental Quality to regulate the compounds.

Meanwhile, the scope of the contamination expanded throughout the state. Scientists found the compounds in fresh vegetables and fish, eggs and beer. Pine needles, honey and house dust. Landfills, compost and sewage sludge.

Blood of horses. Blood of dogs. Their own blood.

Finally, the environmental advocates prevailed. In 2024, Michael Regan, North Carolina’s former top environmental regulator who’d become President Joe Biden’s EPA administrator, announced his agency would regulate five types of PFAS, including GenX, in drinking water.

The celebration was brief.

Now, here was Trump back in the White House, and Zeldin, with support from the chemical industry, was dismantling those hard-won protections.

And now, here were North Carolinians, prepared to battle anew for the health of their communities. To stop Chemours from dumping GenX in landfills. To force the company to pay for drinking water it had defiled. To halt the expansion of the Fayetteville Works plant.

“This is a motivator, not a deflator,” Donovan said, a few weeks after Zeldin’s announcement. “We’re going to continue to fight this, now, more than ever.”

2013-2016: A Movement Is Born

The Cape Fear River begins 200 miles upstream from Wilmington, at the confluence of the Haw and the Deep rivers.

On its journey to the Atlantic Ocean, the Cape Fear rambles through forests of loblolly pine and courses under plains of concrete. About halfway to the sea, where the river grazes Chemours’ Fayetteville Works plant, the company was sending PFAS into the waterway.

Had it not been for Detlef Knappe and several scientists, including Mark Strynar and Andy Lindstrom of the EPA, Chemours could still be doing so.

Knappe is a distinguished professor of civil, construction and environmental engineering at NC State University in Raleigh. He grew up in southern Germany in the small town of Freudenstadt, which translates to “City of Joy.”

Now a lean, ruddy man in his 50s, Knappe has retained shards of his German accent, but its edges have been softened, like rocks weathered by water. He is quiet and modest, and never boasts that he was among the scientists whose findings launched an environmental movement.

In 2013, Knappe and the EPA scientists were curious about a new chemical that DuPont had been manufacturing at Fayetteville Works. It was a replacement for PFOA, another “forever chemical” used in stain-resistant carpet, waterproof apparel and nonstick cookware, which the company agreed to phase out by 2015 due to its health risks.

Coincidentally, the EPA scientists soon stumbled across a pamphlet from DuPont that named the mystery chemical: GenX.

Knappe had preserved water samples from the Cape Fear River for a different project. When the scientists analyzed the samples for GenX, they found average levels in Wilmington at 600 parts per trillion, with spikes reaching 4,500 ppt.

“We all felt that was really high,” Knappe said. “But how do you communicate that information? There’s this mystery chemical, GenX, and we weren’t aware of much information about its toxicity.”

The scientists were right: The levels were as much as 450 times what later became the drinking water standard. Their analysis found GenX was passing through the treatment system at the Sweeney Water Treatment Plant in Wilmington. Residents were drinking, bathing and playing in contaminated water.

As the scientists worked on a paper that contained their new findings, the EPA lowered the health advisory for PFOA and another forever chemical, PFOS, to 70 ppt. While the advisory didn’t apply to GenX, the scientists were concerned about the potential health effects of the new compound, given its high levels in the drinking water.

We have to publish that paper now, Knappe thought.

When the paper came out in November 2016, he shared the findings with state regulators and utilities, but without toxicity data, no one knew what to make of it.

Then a freelance reporter for the Star-News of Wilmington, Vaughn Hagerty, happened upon the scientific paper online. On June 6, 2017, he broke the story of the scientists’ findings about GenX in the city’s drinking water.

People protested in the streets. Residents mobilized on Facebook.

“What was surprising and gratifying was the impact that article made,” Knappe said. “And how, maybe for a moment, politics stopped.”

2017-2018: Clean Cape Fear

Donovan is in her 40s, with chin-length, dark brown hair and glasses. At 5 foot 10, she is swan-like and often towers over a crowd. She worked in corporate marketing for a decade, then moved to Leland, in Brunswick County, from Charlotte with her husband in 2009. At the time, she was pregnant with twins, a boy and girl.

She became a stay-at-home mom and for seven years taught Bible study at Little Chapel on the Boardwalk in Wrightsville Beach. After noticing some children were praying for the health of their loved ones, Donovan said she heard God call her to become an environmental advocate.

In June, she and several concerned residents, including Cape Fear Riverkeeper Kemp Burdette, social activist and retired obstetrician Dr. Jessica Cannon, and former Wilmington Mayor Harper Peterson, gathered at Peterson’s wooden dining room table to discuss how to handle the crisis.

The demonstrations had been powerful, but diffuse. The activists decided they had to channel the public’s anxiety into a coherent movement. They called the group Clean Cape Fear.

In Raleigh, Michael Regan had been the head of the N.C. Department of Environmental Quality for just six months. He was homegrown, having been raised in Goldsboro, about an hour southeast of the capital. He graduated from the historically Black N.C. A&T University in Greensboro before heading to Washington, D.C., for an advanced degree in public administration.

Water pollution and obscure contaminants weren’t Regan’s specialty. He had worked in air quality and clean energy programs at the EPA and later at the Environmental Defense Fund.

Now as head of DEQ, Regan was facing the type of daunting challenge that can define a leader’s legacy.

2017-2018: Stymied at the Legislature

Republican State Rep. Ted Davis Jr., is 75, a trim man with wire-rimmed glasses. A former state and federal prosecutor, he grew up in New Hanover County and drank water from the Cape Fear River for most of his life.

Like most people, Davis knew nothing about PFAS. But as an advisory member of the Joint Environmental Review Commission, he hoped his colleagues would support funding for local governments to address pollutants, monitor the river’s quality and hold hearings on the PFAS contamination.

Yet after a contentious Environmental Review Commission meeting in 2017, the Senate declined to hold another hearing.

Undeterred, Davis approached Republican Tim Moore, then the House speaker, and asked to form a special committee. “I said, ‘Tim, I don’t give a damn whether the Senate is going to support it or not,’” Davis recalled. “‘This is too important.’”

Davis, the senior chairman of the resulting House Select Committee on North Carolina River Quality, presided over seven lengthy meetings with toxicologists, state regulators, scientists and other experts.

Still, several legislators fell in line with the industry’s talking points. State Rep. William Brisson, a former Democrat from Bladen County who had switched parties, downplayed the compounds’ toxicity. “It’s not like the mice fell over dead when they were injected with GenX,” he said at the committee hearing.

Those hearings prompted Davis to introduce the Water Safety Act. But only one of the bill’s provisions became law: A $450,000 allocation to the Cape Fear Public Utility Authority to test the finished drinking water and to install a temporary advanced treatment system was eventually folded into the state budget.

“We all drink the water and we breathe the air, and some of us just don’t seem to care about cleaning it up.”

— State Rep. Deb Butler

2018: A Prayer Circle and Cancer

Brian Long, then the plant manager at Fayetteville Works, paced the floor before more than 100 people at Faith Tabernacle Christian Center. He wore an orange Chemours pin on the lapel of his sport jacket.

It was a cloudy evening in June 2018. The company was hosting a public event in St. Pauls, a small town two hours from Wilmington, to assuage the community’s fears about GenX.

“There’s been a lot reported on this compound,” Long told the frustrated, angry crowd. “We have decades of evidence and studies that suggest this compound—at the levels we see in our environment—do not cause health risks.”

EPA and academic scientists soon found that even at low levels, GenX was associated with harm to the thyroid, liver and kidneys.

Rates of thyroid cancer declined in New Hanover and Brunswick counties, according to National Cancer Institute data from 2017 to 2021, the most recent figures available. However, those two counties still rank second and fifth, respectively, for thyroid cancer rates in North Carolina, data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show.

Kidney cancer rates rose in Brunswick and Pender counties during that time, according to federal data. Pender County leads North Carolina in rates of testicular cancer, also associated with GenX exposure.

Local residents had begun reporting their experiences with cancer and other health problems. Some risk factors, such as age and genetics, make it difficult to establish causation between their illnesses and exposure to PFAS. Yet thyroid, testicular, brain and other cancers have been linked to the compounds.

Several advocates’ families were touched by disorders they felt might have been linked to PFAS exposure. Donovan’s husband, David, had been diagnosed with a benign brain tumor that caused him to go blind until a surgeon removed it.

Dana Sargent, then with Cape Fear River Watch, was worried about her older brother, Grant Raymond, diagnosed nine months before with a malignant brain tumor. He had been exposed to high levels of PFAS while a U.S. Marine and throughout his career as a Chicago firefighter. Doctors had given him less than five years to live. He was only 45.

Sargent, now 51, is from the Chicago area and arrived in North Carolina by way of California and Washington, D.C. She is short and petite, with long, flowing brown hair. She specializes in research, but her other quality is bluntness.

She attended the meeting, which began with a prayer circle that included Chemours. “It was asinine and repulsive to hold a meeting in rural North Carolina, in a church—to help shut people up,” she said. “They knew what they were doing.”

One man in the second row told Long that because of contamination in his neighborhood, he couldn’t sell his house.

“I understand you’re frustrated,” Long said, three times.

The man became angry, and as law enforcement led him out of the church, he told Long, “You have defiled the house of God.”

2018-2019: Chemours Cuts a Deal

Here’s Kemp Burdette, the Cape Fear Riverkeeper, on how to snag an alligator to test its blood for PFAS:

Get a treble hook, the kind used to catch a marlin.

Cast the rod over the alligator, which should be lying in the water. Reel in the line until the hook reaches the alligator, then jerk it with all your strength.

Steer the tired alligator to the bank.

Then, everyone jumps on the alligator (multiple humans, if possible).

Finally, tape the alligator’s mouth shut. Stick a 20-gauge needle at the base of its skull to draw 15 milliliters of blood.

Burdette helped NC State University and EPA scientists apprehend alligators in the Cape Fear River and several nearby lakes to test their blood for PFAS. Alligators spend their long lives in water often polluted with chemicals; they can serve as models for detecting human health problems caused by contamination.

The scientists sampled the blood of 75 alligators and found 14 different PFAS at concentrations similar to levels found in the blood of Wilmington residents. High levels of PFOS would later be found in several species of freshwater fish, prompting the state health department to advise people to eat no more than seven servings a year. Pregnant women should eat none.

It had been more than a year since the contamination had become public, and Burdette was fed up with what he viewed as DEQ’s inertia and Chemours’ negligence. He pestered the attorneys at the Southern Environmental Law Center: We’ve got to do something.

Geoff Gisler, then a senior attorney at SELC, began to strategize, but it soon became apparent to him what needed to happen.

“We sued,” Burdette said.

SELC alleged DEQ was failing to uphold the North Carolina Constitution, a section of which obligates the agency to protect the environment and human health from the effects of pollution. The law center also filed suit against Chemours, alleging it had violated the federal Clean Water Act by discharging PFAS, including GenX, into the Cape Fear River.

By the fall of 2018, DEQ and Chemours were trying to make a deal.

“In some ways it was a very sterile process,” Burdette recalled. “But it was also very tense. I felt like we didn’t need to do a whole lot of negotiating because we were right. They had poisoned the drinking water supply, and the state had let them do it. I didn’t want to compromise, and I think we did as little of that as we possibly could.”

By February 2019, the parties had crafted a consent order. Among the many provisions in the 46-page document was a requirement for the company to sample private wells for a dozen types of PFAS and to provide clean water to households whose wells were contaminated above certain thresholds.

No longer could Chemours discharge wastewater into the river as part of its manufacturing processes. No longer could the company expel hundreds of tons of GenX from its smokestacks; it had to reduce the emissions by 99.9 percent.

DEQ, too, had specific duties to hold Chemours accountable, including levying a record $13 million civil penalty.

“I think it’s been a tremendous success,” Gisler said in a recent interview. “It was never the final word and would never fix all the problems, but it’s a big step in the right direction. It’s our view that the polluter has to pay, and that hasn’t been happening, because the state and the EPA had not been enforcing it.”

In retrospect, Sargent, the former head of Cape Fear River Watch, wishes the consent order had been tougher. But when the document was finalized, few, if anyone, could foresee the scientific advances in detection methods.

“We didn’t know then that there were 350 types of PFAS coming out of Chemours,” Sargent said. “There’s still people falling through the cracks.”

Some of those people lived in Brunswick County, where private drinking water wells and river water entering the Northwest treatment plant were contaminated. That plant served homes, businesses and schools, including the one Donovan’s young children attended.

“It sickens me to think I may have hurt my children by letting them drink that tap water,” Donovan testified before the U.S. House Oversight Subcommittee in 2019. She urged its members to pass a law banning the manufacture of the compounds. “I will forever wonder if one day that will cause them medical harm.”

At the hearing, she named her friends—Sarah, Tom, Kara—all young, all with rare or recurrent cancers.

“I am begging you to engage your humanity, to find the moral courage,” Donovan said. Her voice cracked. “To protect the most valuable economic resource—human life. Because it’s already too late for some of us.”

Some of Donovan’s friends have since died. “They left kids who are questioning their faith, wondering why God hates them so much that they gave their parents cancer and didn’t save them,” Donovan said. “The people who fought so hard to get answers of what caused their cancer died not knowing.”

Sargent’s brother, Grant, was among them. In December 2019, two years and three months after his diagnosis, his brain tumor killed him.

2021-2022: Quest for Accountability

One spring day, Donovan spotted odd-looking sea foam near the Ocean Crest Pier in Oak Island, a popular spot for saltwater fishing. She learned that the best time to find the foam is after a storm or on extremely windy days, when the water is agitated. She scanned live beach video feeds and local social media chats, where people posted photos of the foam blooms.

Her sightings, as it turned out, were not isolated to the coast. State officials had seen similar foam at 15 other spots, including in Falls Lake near Raleigh and a stream in the southern foothills of the Appalachian mountains.

Eventually Donovan collected samples from 13 sites in the Cape Fear River and along the coast, including near airports and military installations, which often use firefighting foam that contains the compounds. NC State scientists began an analysis, a process that took more than a year.

In Raleigh, Davis, the Republican representative from New Hanover County who had successfully negotiated for GenX funding, was still trying to pass legislation to hold Chemours accountable. He sponsored a new bill, “PFAS Pollution and Polluter Liability,” that would require that polluters who discharged PFAS into a public water system pay for treatment costs to remove the compounds.

“I’m going to fight for my constituency,” Davis said at a hearing of the House Judiciary Committee. “If the gentleman from Chemours really wants to show they care, why don’t they pay to make the water safe from the contamination they put in that river?”

The legislation was referred to the Agriculture and Environment Committee, but, like several PFAS-related bills before it, never received a hearing.

In the same legislative session, Butler, the New Hanover County attorney now in her second term as a representative, sponsored House Bill 444. It was more aggressive than Davis’ bill and extended liability to dischargers of the compounds, not only the manufacturers.

The bill had more than 20 co-sponsors, including a Republican, Frank Iler of Brunswick County. It never received a committee hearing.

Michael Regan had overseen North Carolina’s PFAS crisis as DEQ secretary, but a hostile legislature and an indolent EPA under the first Trump administration hamstrung much of his effort to change policy. In 2021, Biden empowered him to take steps to protect the nation’s drinking water in his new role as EPA administrator.

Yet three years had passed since Regan had joined the EPA and environmental advocates had become impatient with what they viewed as the agency’s sluggish progress on regulating PFAS.

Then, on a warm morning in April, Regan returned to North Carolina, to Fayetteville, the Cape Fear River flowing behind him.

He had arrived to announce the first legally enforceable maximum concentration levels for PFOA and PFOS at 4 parts per trillion and for GenX, PFNA and PFHxS at 10 parts per trillion. Several of the compounds were also regulated as a mixture.

Although the standards applied to only five of the 15,000 types of PFAS, they were something.

“This is the most significant action on PFAS the EPA has ever taken,” Regan said. “The result is a comprehensive and life-changing rule, one that will improve the health and vitality of so many communities across our country.”

Donovan credited the progress to the EPA’s openness to meeting with environmental advocates.

“We had conversations and incredible access to the EPA. We were given the same level of stakeholder value as the industries, maybe even more,” Donovan said. “The Regan we saw at the EPA was much more muscular than at DEQ.”

Not everyone applauded the regulations. Some conservative members of North Carolina’s Environmental Management Commission, which approves or disapproves rules proposed by DEQ, blanched at Regan’s announcement.

Michael Ellison, who was appointed to the commission by Senate President Pro Temp Phil Berger, has a history of downplaying concerns about the compounds. At a meeting that summer, Ellison asked, rhetorically, “For decades we’ve been making and discharging this stuff. How many people have died from PFAS poisoning?”

Sargent was sitting in the room. Her eyes watered. She thought of her brother and the cruelty of Ellison’s remark.

“He had no empathy,” she recalled. “He thought this was a joke.“

The American Water Works Association, a national trade group of public utilities, opposed the standards for financial reasons. The Biden administration had earmarked $1 billion to help utilities in small or disadvantaged communities cover the costs of advanced treatment to remove the compounds, yet that was a fraction of the estimated $30 billion needed for all of the nation’s affected water systems.

In North Carolina, more than 1,900 public water systems would be required to comply with the new rules by 2029. If the maximum contaminant levels had been in effect on the day of Regan’s announcement, the drinking water of at least 300 systems would exceed them.

Two months later, the trade group sued the EPA, arguing the agency hadn’t followed the legally required procedures when it made the rules.

Regan felt assured the standards could withstand a legal challenge. What he wasn’t accounting for was that in seven months Donald Trump would win a second term and that Regan’s successor would begin to brazenly repeal the standards.

May 2025: The Persistent Republican

It was after 7 p.m. on May 7, and the North Carolina House of Representatives had been debating bills for five hours. Davis, wearing a gray suit with a white pocket square and a red tie, rose from Seat No. 9 in the House chamber.

“We’ve had a long day and we’re all tired,” Davis said. “But I hope you’ll give serious consideration to what I have to say.”

Davis was a primary sponsor of a bill titled “PFAS Pollution and Polluter Liability,” modeled after his previous legislation. It was just two pages. Although it didn’t mention Chemours by name, the language was so specific, it could mean no one else.

If a PFAS manufacturer contaminated a public utility’s drinking water above federally permissible levels, it would have to pay for the installation, maintenance and operation of a treatment system to reduce concentrations in finished drinking water to comply with those limits.

“You can make all the PFAS you want,” Davis told his colleagues, “but you can’t release it into the environment.”

A last-minute amendment—key to garnering enough votes for the bill to pass—narrowed the list of eligible public water systems to those that incurred costs of more than $50 million. Those were the systems in New Hanover, Brunswick and Cumberland counties, which, without the bill, would pass the costs on to ratepayers.

“These costs should be the responsibility of the polluter,” Davis said. “It’s only fair.”

Unlike Davis’ previous PFAS legislation, this bill crossed party lines to include many Republicans. It had more than 40 co-sponsors, including some of the most progressive Democrats in the House.

The members began to vote. On the digital screens mounted in the House chamber, names of those voting yes lit up in green. After 26 seconds, nearly the entire screen was green. The bill passed 104-3.

Davis was ecstatic. It had taken five years for him to carry a Polluter Pays bill this far.

“I was tickled to death,” Davis said later. “That guy from Chemours,” seated in the gallery, “I could see he had a sick look.”

With the House in the win column, Davis now had to convince the Senate to support his legislation.

May 2025: Sea Foam and an Industry Unrestrained

A few hours before Donovan’s sea foam presentation at Ocean View United Methodist Church, Lee Zeldin, Trump’s EPA administrator, dropped the hammer. He would rescind Regan’s maximum concentration levels for GenX and three other PFAS compounds.

The EPA announcement was even more troubling in light of the results of the long-awaited study on the PFAS-laden sea foam.

Jeffrey Enders, a research assistant professor at NC State University, detected 42 types of PFAS, including some manufactured only by Chemours. One type that Chemours used as a replacement for a phased-out compound, PFO5DoA, was detected at 20,000 parts per trillion. In a different study, scientists had previously found PFO5DoA in 99 percent of the 344 Wilmington residents who provided blood samples.

Levels of PFOS, which has not been produced in the U.S. since 2002, were found in the foam as high as 8 million ppt—the highest concentration ever reported in published scientific journals.

After Enders’ presentation, people told their personal stories.

“I live in Brunswick County and have been exposed my entire life,” one woman said, including while she was pregnant. Her drinking water well had a total PFAS level of 300 ppt.

“Now my kids are having issues,” she said, as she began to cry. “This hits hard.”

June 2025: The Senate Takes Up the Bill

Three weeks later, Davis’ bill was up for discussion in the Senate Environment Committee.

A few Republican members had warmed to regulating Chemours. “We need to run this bill,” said state Sen. Tom McInnis, a Republican whose district includes Cumberland County, another heavily contaminated area. “The folks at Chemours are notorious for not doing what’s right.”

Some Democrats thought the bill didn’t go far enough, although they agreed to support it. “You’re trying to hold the most culpable company responsible,” said Sen. Julie Mayfield of Buncombe County. “I just want people to understand this might not solve the problem.”

“I wish we could get rid of it all, but that would be herculean,” Davis said. “This is a baby step, but it might put a little bit of fear in anyone who might make PFAS.”

The tension in the room tightened. A parade of industry lobbyists began speaking to the committee, including from Chemours.

Jeff Fritz of Chemours said state regulators knew in the early 2000s that DuPont, which later spun part of its business off as Chemours, was making PFAS, including GenX. That is true. However, state records show that while regulators knew about the manufacturing, the companies failed to disclose in their discharge permits that they were sending PFAS into the Cape Fear River.

Fritz also claimed that Chemours voluntarily decided to stop discharging all PFAS. But he omitted the fact that the company did so only under scrutiny by state regulators. And that Chemours failed to stop all discharges until a second state inspection discovered GenX was still entering the river from the plant.

The bill didn’t advance. It’s eligible to be heard again next year.

September 2025: Zeldin Targets GenX for Rollback

In September, EPA Administrator Zeldin made good on his promise. The agency filed a motion in the U.S. Court of Appeals in the District of Columbia to vacate Regan’s maximum contamination levels for GenX and the three other PFAS compounds, siding with the American Water Works Association, a trade group that had opposed them.

“This is a flat-out victory for Chemours,” Donovan said. “They’re playing their game, and the Trump EPA is 100 percent caving to industry pressure.”

The argument hinges on what Zeldin alleges is an administrative misstep: When the EPA enacted the rule under Regan, it allegedly did so out of sequence.

The Safe Drinking Water Act requires the EPA to first publish a notice of intent to regulate a contaminant and seek public comment on whether it should, in fact, be regulated.

Only then can the agency propose a national primary drinking water standard and goal for the contaminant. That step requires another public comment period.

Zeldin alleges Regan’s EPA proposed and finalized a regulatory determination—as well as the regulation itself—“simultaneously and in tandem.” Without a second comment period, Zeldin argued, the agency “denied the public and the regulated community the opportunity to adequately comment on and participate in the rulemaking process.”

The EPA proposed the PFAS drinking water standards in March 2023 and provided a 60-day comment period. More than 120,000 comments were submitted, including by those now challenging the rule, according to the SELC, which also provided comments.

The agency then published a detailed 4,570-page response to those comments.

Zeldin’s EPA intends to issue a draft rule rescinding the regulations for public comment this fall; a final rule on the maximum contamination levels (MCLs) is expected next spring.

A Chemours spokesperson said the company supports the EPA’s decision. “Chemours wholly supports setting reasonable and scientifically justified MCLs,” the spokesperson said, “but getting the science right is absolutely critical, and the evidence clearly demonstrates that the previous determination for GenX is flawed.”

The EPA retained two independent scientific panels to review its findings. Over 135 pages, the 12 reviewers largely agreed with the conclusions, with minor suggestions; the agency incorporated many of them.

Chemours is cherry-picking the facts, trying to “confuse the narrative,” Donovan said.

The company cited six scientific studies conducted from 2018 to 2023 that concluded GenX’s toxic effects on rodent livers could not be extrapolated to humans because of a genetic difference in how a protein behaves between the two species.

However, four of those studies included a conflict of interest statement from the scientists, many of whom work for private consulting firms, indicating the research had been done on behalf of Chemours.

EPA scientists challenged those Chemours-backed findings. They cited examples of how the protein in question is relevant to both species; in humans, medicines are developed to target that very protein.

More than 40 concerned parties have either petitioned to intervene in the case or to file briefs in support of keeping the standards: Prominent scientists, like Linda Birnbaum, a toxicologist and former director of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences; attorneys general from 17 states, including Jeff Jackson of North Carolina; and environmental groups, including Cape Fear River Watch and Clean Cape Fear.

It’s uncertain whether the rescission will survive a court challenge. Under the federal backsliding rule, the EPA can’t legally repeal the standards, said Jean Zhuang, senior attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center. The Safe Drinking Water Act stipulates that changes to the standards can only be more protective, not less.

“What Zeldin has announced is clearly in violation of the law, in addition to harming over 100 million Americans and their drinking water,” Zhuang said. “These industries, like Chemours, are fighting these drinking water standards because then the pressure is off them to control these chemicals.”

Regardless of what happens at the federal level, a DEQ spokesperson said the agency will continue to enforce the consent order. It is also gathering data from public water systems to help them meet the drinking water standards for PFOA and PFOS by the new deadline of 2031.

Accounting for private wells and public drinking water systems, DEQ estimates 3.5 million North Carolinians are exposed to levels of PFAS above federal standards.

The same day that Zeldin filed the motion in federal court about the GenX standards, DEQ announced it was requiring Chemours to offer private well testing to an additional 14,000 residents in New Hanover, Brunswick, Columbus and Pender counties.

This brings the total to more than 200,000 homes in 10 counties that are eligible for PFAS testing. Of those, state records show more than 22,000 have been sampled and nearly 7,500 have qualified for alternate water supplies as stipulated in the consent order.

Previous testing has found PFAS 400 feet deep, nearly to bedrock, and in wells as far as 28 miles from Fayetteville Works.

DEQ says it has not yet found the contamination’s edge.

The orders spanned initiatives regarding nuclear fuel supply, waste management, workforce development, reactor exports, and more.

President Trump, noting that domestic fuel sources today supply only 5% of the fuel used in U.S. nuclear reactors, focused on reversing a 48-year-old policy that bars reprocessing of spent fuel for commercial reactors and on reinvigorating the mining of domestic deposits of uranium and thorium that can power advanced nuclear reactors.

Trump also noted that the U.S. record on building domestic nuclear power plants has been dismal (and that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has been a chief obstacle) and took action to streamline the nuclear energy permitting process. His goal is to prioritize upgrades to existing nuclear reactors, build another 10 large reactors by the end of this decade, and promote advanced nuclear technologies, including small modular reactors and microreactors.

The immediate reaction from the fusion industry to Trump’s election, according to Michael Heumann in The Fusion Report, was that his support for fossil fuels would take money away from fusion research but that -- because Trump wants to beat China in everything -- he would likely move fusion forward aggressively. The nuclear fission community also warmed to the prospect of a Trump-led nuclear renaissance.

Other voices, however, were not so sanguine. The potential for small modular fission reactors and even microreactors, as well as the hope for “free” energy from fusion, was not good news for some observers, notably “green” energy promoters and the ever-present nuclear fear community. Nuclear will always cost too much, say some, while to others nuclear will never be safe.

Claudia Lopez Lloreda, writing in Undark, criticized the Trump Administration for trying to rely on deregulation to “kickstart a nuclear renaissance.” She opposed any diminishment of NRC regulatory obstacles to nuclear energy development. She said experts are divided on whether any of these new nuclear technologies are worth the investment and agreed with Union of Concerned Scientists spokesperson Edwin Lyman that the nuclear energy field is “in a hype bubble that is driving unrealistic expectations.”

Similarly, Beyond Nuclear’s Kevin Kamps argued that “irrational nuclear exuberance is reaching a pitch. Spiking electricity demand, cratering nuclear regulation, reckless nuclear boosterism, and federal attacks on renewables have produced a perfect storm fueling nuclear expansionism … that may blow us onto the rocks” and make climate change worse.

He decried the rise of “zombie nukes” – the restarting of Three Mile Island, Palisades , and Duane Arnold powerplants that were shut down decades ago. He mocked a “nuclear hubris” that emboldened NASA to pledge to put a reactor on the Moon by 2030. Worst of all, he claimed, are the “so-called ‘advanced’ reactors, including small modular reactors,” which he said are neither new nor small and probably not even modular – given that many of the 127 designs are speculative and have not ever been built.

But here’s the Catch-22.

The regulations were specifically designed to impede nuclear energy development, making nuclear energy infrastructure too expensive and too time-consuming to build. The huge cost overruns at the recently activated Vogtle Units 3 and 4 in Georgia bear witness to that thesis. Georgia Power began the permitting process for both units in 2008, but it was not until 2023 and 2024 that they finally went online.

Meanwhile, according to the Breakthrough Institute, nearly every Chinese nuclear project since 2010 has achieved construction in 7 years or less. Chinese financiers and builders also completed six nuclear reactors in Pakistan in less than six years each. Russia has been delivering finished reactors within 6-9 years; South Korea has built three reactors in the United Arab Emirates in under 9 years each.

This real-world trend, says Breakthrough, flies in the face of “the tiresome and longstanding claims” that nuclear reactors require a decade or longer (15 years for Georgia Power) to build. But Georgia Power had it relatively easy. A dozen U.S. states, representing 27% of all U.S. electricity customers, have laws restricting or forbidding deployment of new nuclear energy.

California’s 1976 moratorium on new nuclear facilities is two years older than Hawaii’s – and Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, and Vermont all remain officially anti-nuclear. On the other hand, by the end of 2023, Connecticut, Illinois, Kentucky, Montana, West Virginia, and Wisconsin had repealed or modified existing laws stifling nuclear power plant deployment.

The Illinois Policy Institute, however, says that the state in 2023 only lifted limits on new (small modular) reactors generating under 300 MW, none of which are planned in Illinois. The 40-year-old ban on large-scale, grid-connected reactors remains intact – strangely, in a state with six operating nuclear power plants and 11 reactors that generate 54% of Illinois’ electricity.

Despite the naysayers, both fission and fusion startups have seen massive infusions of cash – concomitant with the anticipated restructuring of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission toward a more nuclear-friendly approach to permitting and oversight of nuclear reactors. As statutory and regulatory obstacles to a nuclear renaissance fade away, other challenges may be just as formidable – most notably, the challenge of securing reliable, affordable sources of nuclear fuels.

Irina Slav reports that tight supplies of uranium could interfere with global plans for increased nuclear power generation. With global uranium demand set to increase by over 30% -- to 86,000 tons – over the next four years and go nearly double that to 150,000 tons by 2040, supply will be shrinking, with output from existing mines set to fall by half between 2030 and 2040. Worse, it takes 10 to 20 years to bring a new uranium mine into production.

Pursuant to his July executive orders, President Trump has taken quick action to jumpstart U.S. efforts to secure an adequate nuclear fuel supply through the Department of Energy’s new Fuel Line Pilot Program. Six companies have been approved for pilot projects under the program to develop reactor-specific fuels.

The White House has also added South Dakota’s Dewer Burdock uranium mine project to its FAST-41 permitting process in an effort to resolve a multitude of administrative and court appeals that have bottled up this vital resource for years.

Still, securing long-term domestic supplies of nuclear reactor fuel may be just as difficult a task as building new nuclear reactors has been in the United States for the past half century. But China – and other nations – are still moving much more rapidly to build out a nuclear-powered future than the plodding, bickering U.S. electorate has allowed on our own soil.

Newsom vetoes energy bills on virtual power plants, load management, and interconnection

Utility Dive – October 6

Governor Gavin Newsom last week vetoed several pieces of energy legislation, including AB 740, which would have required the state to adopt a virtual power plant deployment plan. In a letter to the governor last month, more than a dozen trade and environmental advocacy groups urged Newsom to sign AB 740 into law, claiming VPPs could save Californians $750 million per year in system costs and provide more than 7,500 MW of capacity. Newsom said that he supported the aim of harnessing distributed energy resources, but that the bill would have resulted in costs to the California Energy Commission’s primary operating fund, “which is currently facing an ongoing structural deficit.”

Who is Growing? U.S. Natural Gas Leaders

Key Takeaways

Shale Crescent USA leads U.S. natural gas leaders, adding 34 Bcf/d (351 Bcm/yr) since 2008—more than Texas, Louisiana, and the rest of the U.S. combined.

Natural gas in the Shale Crescent USA has grown more than any other region of the world over the last 20 years.

Each 1 Bcf/d (~10 Bcm/yr) serves about 5.5 million homes per day, highlighting industrial and consumer impact.

Gas production in different U.S. regions varies over time, but which region has had the highest growth in output in recent years?

This map, created in partnership with Shale Crescent USA, shows where natural gas production growth from 2008 to 2024 is concentrated, using data from the EIA.

Shale Crescent in the Lead

Here is a table showing 2008–2024 growth in Billion Cubic Feet Per Day (Bcf/d) and Billion Cubic Meters Per Year (Bcm/yr) for each region.

From 2008–2024, Shale Crescent USA (Ohio, West Virginia, Pennsylvania) grew by 34 Bcf/d (351 Bcm/yr), outpacing the Gulf Coast’s 16 Bcf/d (165 Bcm/yr) and the rest of the U.S. at 6 Bcf/d (62 Bcm/yr).

Notably, the Shale Crescent’s growth exceeded Texas, Louisiana, and the rest of the U.S. combined. Additionally, 1 Bcf/d (~10 Bcm/yr) can supply roughly 5.5 million U.S. single-family homes per day, underscoring the scale of this surge.

Why Such Large Growth?

Shale Crescent USA’s remarkable growth stems from technological breakthroughs that unlocked vast energy resources within world-class rock formations. This region was the birthplace of the oil and gas industry more than 150 years ago, and it remains a global leader. No other area on Earth has experienced greater growth over the past two decades.

The Marcellus and Utica shale formations hold one of the largest, most prolific gas endowments in North America, giving gas producers a deep inventory of high-quality drilling locations.

The second key driver is infrastructure and market access. As demand shifted toward gas-fired power—especially in the Northeast—new and expanded pipelines connected Marcellus/Utica volumes to nearby load centers and, increasingly, to the Midwest and Gulf Coast.

Landmark projects such as Shell’s ethane cracker in Pennsylvania, Nucor’s steel plant in West Virginia, and Intel’s semiconductor facility in Ohio, along with a growing number of data centers and other energy-intensive users, are benefiting from this region’s reliable and affordable energy supply.

The launch took place during the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) World Conservation Congress 2025, which is being held at the Abu Dhabi National Exhibition Centre (ADNEC Centre Abu Dhabi) from 9-15 October.

The initiative's pavilion at the conference showcased a range of innovative initiatives developed by EAD in collaboration with its partners, including a large-scale project to restore mangrove habitats in cooperation with Nabat Company, its technology and implementation partner. Using modern technologies, including artificial intelligence (AI) and drones, the project will collect and analyse high-resolution data from satellites and drones to identify optimal areas for mangrove planting, efficiently scatter seeds with minimal waste and monitor plant growth after planting.

A model of an advanced AI-powered autonomous robot vehicle was also displayed. The robot, developed in collaboration with Micropolis Robotics, is intended for use in environmental monitoring and local vegetation restoration programmes. The vehicle’s automated features enable it to prepare and till the soil and carry out irrigation operations in seed-scattering areas to increase the chances of germination. The vehicle is also equipped with a drone for monitoring, mapping and seed-scattering purposes.

Her Excellency Dr Shaikha Salem Al Dhaheri, Secretary General of EAD, said: “The launch of the Nature X Abu Dhabi initiative embodies our commitment to employing the latest scientific and technological innovations to conserve, protect, and monitor the environment, and to enhance cooperation between national and international institutions in the field of nature conservation. The initiative also contributes to supporting the national strategic goals for sustainable development and ensuring the sustainability of natural resources for the benefit of future generations.”

His Excellency Shahab Issa Abu Shahab, Director General of Advanced Technology Research Council (ATRC), said: “Nature X Abu Dhabi is a culmination of our vision for using advanced technology and research to address climate change. Through this collaboration between the Environment Agency - Abu Dhabi and ATRC, we’re combining advanced technology and extensive environmental data to help conserve and restore ecosystems at scale. This work demonstrates our shared commitment to setting new standards for climate action, both here and worldwide.”

In support of the sustainable aquaculture sector, the Delma Fish farming project was showcased as a model of innovation in marine food production. The project harnesses artificial intelligence to manage offshore cage farms, continuously monitoring water quality, fish health and behaviour to optimise conditions for growth and sustainability.

Complementing this effort, a drone developed in collaboration with Aqua Bridge Holding and EANAN Al Samma UAV, the first of its kind in the region, was also on display. This advanced system automates fish feeding with remarkable precision, reducing feed waste, enhancing growth rates and significantly lowering manual effort and operational risk across aquaculture sites.

Also highlighted was the Fish AI project, a pioneering initiative that employs artificial intelligence to accurately identify fish species in real time. By providing instant, data-driven insights on species composition, size, quantity and biomass, this technology is revolutionising how marine resources are monitored and managed.

The pavilion also showcased a model of an advanced autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) in development by the Technology Innovation Institute (TII). Equipped with advanced sensors and AI-powered cameras, the AUV is designed to scan the seafloor and produce highly accurate maps of vital marine habitats, including coral reefs and oyster beds.

Growing up “wildly into cars,” Scaringe said he knew as a 10-year-old that he wanted to one day start his own car company.

“I didn’t really know what that meant. I certainly had no idea how hard that was going to be and then subsequently started working towards it,” Scaringe told the Business Journal in an exclusive interview.

Scaringe has succeeded in an industry that has had few startups because of high capital costs. He has convinced investors like Amazon, Ford and Volkswagen to pony up billions.

He started a factory in Illinois that’s scheduled to produce as many as 43,500 vehicles this year. Rivian last month broke ground on a $5 billion factory in Georgia with a goal of annually making up to 400,000 vehicles.

“It’s just a very hard business to build, and so hard that most entrepreneurs, I should say, are highly idealistic and optimistic,” Scaringe said. “And as I reflect back, it’s good that I was so idealistic.”

While the share price has faded after its exuberant initial public offering in 2021, the company still sports a $16 billion market valuation with sales that are expected to reach $5.3 billion this year and then accelerate 33% to $7 billion in 2026.

Even with the end of federal EV tax credits, the founder is holding onto his vision.

“I’ve said this many times: I’ve never been as confident as I am today about what our trajectory looks like.”

With about 1,800 employees in Orange County, it is the largest automaker with operations here.

The Beginning

Scaringe dove into the car industry as a teen. He gained experience restoring cars, then jumped to a machine shop in his Florida hometown, where he worked until he went to college. Scaringe studied mechanical engineering at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in New York City and then pursued his PhD at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).

In 2009, Scaringe founded Rivian right out of school.

“I knew I wanted to start a car company, but then as I started to think about it more, I realized I wanted to start something that was going to help make these things that I love so much less bad,” he said with a laugh.

“I realized the cars that I adored and I enjoyed being around and working on were part of so many of our big geopolitical and social challenges.”

Whether those conflicts were about oil, local air quality or the general climate, Scaringe said he was motivated to figure out how to make more efficient cars.

“To me, it’s so clear, it’s indisputable that I can’t even imagine a future state where in the fullness of time—now whether that’s 10 years from now or 50 years from now—that everything on the road is electric.”

Scaringe designed Rivian to be a major part of this transition.

The entrepreneur said he initially started with a sports car but shifted to an SUV and truck instead, knowing these were top-selling vehicle types.

“That is something we’re deeply convicted in. And part of why Rivian exists is to help make really exciting and engaging electric vehicles that, regardless of your views on sustainability or climate, it’s just a better product.”

Not the Classic Startup Story

Scaringe said that one of the biggest challenges of starting an automotive company was the amount of capital required to stay afloat and scale.

“You need a lot of capital to develop the technology. You need technology to raise the capital,” he said.

“For a hardware business, it’s the hardest part. It’s very different than a typical software business, where you can do a Series A financing and launch it out of your house or out of your dorm room, which is the classic story.

“I used to say all the time, if you had $5 billion, a 4,000-person engineering team, a manufacturing plant, 300 to 400 willing suppliers, and you had all those things at the very, very beginning, it would still take you four years to launch the first product,” Scaringe added. “And the challenge is you have none of those things.”

Scaringe took Rivian public in 2021 with that year’s largest initial public offering (IPO) of almost $12 billion. Its market cap soared above $120 billion shortly thereafter.

Rivian has since released the R1 SUV and truck alongside its electric commercial delivery vans, which are used by Amazon.

Next in the lineup are the smaller and less expensive R2 SUVs, set to arrive in 2026, and the R3 models—which were revealed in 2024 at Rivian’s retail showroom in Laguna Beach.

Manufacturing currently takes place out of a 4.3-million-square-foot facility in Normal, Illinois. Rivian in September broke ground on its long-awaited plant in Georgia, where it plans to manufacture the R2 and R3 platforms starting in 2028. The secondary outpost is expected to generate 400,000 units of annual production capacity.

Volkswagen Group is Rivian’s most recent believer. After forming a joint venture in 2024, the Irvine automaker unlocked a $1 billion equity investment from Volkswagen after reporting its second consecutive quarter of gross profit in May; it was funded during the second quarter ended June.

In total, the JV deal secured $5.8 billion from the German manufacturer to further develop Rivian’s in-vehicle software.

Unlocking Growth with the R2

Since going public four years ago, Rivian has had a long list of things to prove to investors and Wall Street. At press time, the company has a $15.7 billion market cap with shares trading around $13.14 apiece.

As of now, Scaringe said it’s no longer about whether customers are going to buy the EVs.

“When an investor looks at Rivian today, they’re not questioning the demand generation capabilities because of the success of R1,” he said.

Esquire named the Tri-Motor R1S the publication’s Car of the Year for 2025. In California, the R1 is the best-selling premium SUV, EV or non-EV, over $70,000 according to the state’s New Car Dealers Association in 2024.

“It’s, ‘can we ramp R2, and can we grow awareness beyond the coast?’” Scaringe said.

In Orange County, Rivian sales are down 11% to 999 through the first eight months of 2025; its market share is 0.9%, according to the OC Automobile Dealers Association.

By contrast, rival Tesla also saw its sales fall 15% to 15,910; it has a 13.9% market share, lagging only Toyota, which has an 18.1% share. During the same period, overall vehicle sales climbed 2.1% to 114,105 in Orange County.

The CEO said that the R2 will be the key to unlocking future growth. And so far, production is on track.

The vehicle puts Rivian into a lower price point with the R2 starting around $45,000, compared to the R1’s average price tag of $90,000. And the R3 crossovers will be priced even lower.

With the R2’s smaller price point, it reaches “the full breadth of the market.”

“All the things we’ve done in R2 are built off of learnings we’ve had from R1,” Scaringe said. “We took everything we did on R1—which is an amazing car—we refactored into a smaller form, much smaller, and took a lot of cost out.”

“Just bringing that to market is going to open up a whole new aperture of different types of customers who can come into the brand,” he added.

Rivian recently narrowed its delivery outlook for 2025 to a range of 41,500 to 43,500 vehicles, from its previous guidance of 40,000 to 46,000.

Scaringe said the R2 release will be responsible for generating a “tremendous amount of growth.”

He said he’d be “happy” if the company could get a sizeable fraction of the huge market for the R2 vehicle type—5-seater, two row SUVs.

“We’re right bullseye in the biggest market, priced perfectly with the right segment.

From Their Eyes

Underneath that photo of RJ Scaringe at around 10 years old driving a go-kart is a picture of his oldest son Pete also riding in a go-kart. The nine-year-old recently starred in Rivian

Automotive’s latest commercial called “What If.”

Scaringe said it was around this age when he knew that he was going to create a car company.

Cut to founding Rivian in 2009, moving to California a few years later and now raising his three sons Pete, Max and Miles in Orange County, Scaringe is preparing to launch the second iteration of Rivian vehicles in 2026—the R2.

When looking back on the moments leading up to now, Scaringe thinks about his children when they launched the first car.

“They were born into this environment of ‘Dad is working on this car,’ and for their lives until end of 2021, it was this abstract thing, because there was no car out there,” he said.

The R1 rolled out to customers in November 2021, around the same time Rivian went public.

“So seeing it through their eyes, that suddenly this thing that Dad was working on became a thing that their friends at school would talk about and they would see, it was sort of surreal,” Scaringe said.",https://ocbj.wppcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/RIVIAN-founder-NEW-scaled-e1760131871557.jpg,N,,2025-10-13 13:01:40.782867

As deputy assistant secretary for Energy Transformation and the special envoy for International Energy Affairs, McCarrick promoted exports of American liquefied natural gas to Europe in the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and advocated for Asian countries to invest in natural gas.
The “solution” of powering AI with gas is part of Trump’s AI energy policy platform.
“I don’t want to say this because climate change is so serious and so hard of a problem,” Altman said in a 2023 interview.
Thiel is also a long-time Trump donor, having given at least $1.75 million to Trump campaigns from 2016 to 2020.","As artificial intelligence company OpenAI plans its rapid construction of behemoth power-guzzling data centers to fuel the AI boom, it has hired a new energy chief – an official from the first Trump administration who is a dedicated champion of natural gas.

John McCarrick, the company’s new head of Global Energy Policy, was a senior energy policy advisor in the first Trump administration’s Bureau of Energy Resources in the Department of State while under former Secretaries of State Rex Tillerson and Mike Pompeo.

As deputy assistant secretary for Energy Transformation and the special envoy for International Energy Affairs, McCarrick promoted exports of American liquefied natural gas to Europe in the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and advocated for Asian countries to invest in natural gas.

The choice to hire McCarrick matches the intentions of OpenAI’s Trump-donating CEO Sam Altman, who said in a U.S. Senate hearing in May that “in the short term, I think [the future of powering AI] probably looks like more natural gas.”

It also aligns with the company’s early moves toward powering new data centers, huge warehouses full of linked-up computers that require enormous quantities of water and electricity, to run with gas. OpenAI’s U.S. Stargate Project site in Texas, which is slated to become one of the largest data center sites in the world, is already installing off-grid gas turbines to power its operations.

“Big Tech’s collusion with the Trump administration’s fossil fuel agenda for artificial intelligence is evident in their massive investment in methane gas power infrastructure — as well as pro-gas political operatives like McCarrick,” Tyson Slocum, director of consumer advocacy organization Public Citizen’s Energy Program, said.

The “solution” of powering AI with gas is part of Trump’s AI energy policy platform. In a July speech to announce a $96 billion AI and energy funding package, Trump lauded fossil fuel and coal-powered data center development while flanked by oil and gas executives.

By installing gas turbines to power its data centers, OpenAI has joined a growing cadre of tech giants, including Meta, xAI, and Microsoft, that have begun installing gas-powered generators at their data center sites to meet the surging energy demands of the supercomputer complexes.

OpenAI has additionally chosen not to disclose the carbon footprint of ChatGPT-5, its most advanced AI model to date, despite the fact that researchers told the Guardian it uses “a significantly larger amount of energy” than responses from GPT-40. The company, which is rapidly expanding internationally, does not have formally announced climate or sustainability targets.

Altman has also expressed that he thinks artificial intelligence will solve climate change, despite the fact that the technology’s voracious, ever-expanding demand for electricity poses a serious threat to net-zero targets worldwide.

“I don’t want to say this because climate change is so serious and so hard of a problem,” Altman said in a 2023 interview. “But I think once we have a really powerful superintelligence, addressing climate change will not be particularly difficult for a system like that.”

As Altman’s energy pick, McCarrick has a long history of hawking oil and gas. Previously, McCarrick advised on energy policy for Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney’s 2012 election campaign. At the time, Romney, who did not mention climate change in his energy platform, held the stance that the U.S. should ramp up coal and other forms of fossil fuel production.

Even earlier, as a senior energy policy advisor for the McCain-Palin campaign in 2008, McCarrick claimed to be the source of its “‘all of the above’ energy strategy” in his LinkedIn profile.

At a campaign rally during the 2008 presidential campaign, vice presidential candidate and then-Alaska Governor Sarah Palin adopted the phrase, announcing: “John [McCain] and I will adopt the all of the above approach,” she said, listing a variety of cleaner energy sources before adding, “we’ll develop clean coal technology, and we’ll drill for the billions of barrels of oil and that we have right now warehoused underground including our resources offshore. We will drill here and drill now — and here’s where you chant ‘drill baby drill.’”

Hiring a former member of Trump’s team aligns OpenAI even more closely to the current Trump administration.

OpenAI’s CEO Altman already donated $1 million to the Trump inauguration fund. He also accompanied Trump to the UK in September for the president’s second state visit where Trump announced the U.S.-UK Technology Prosperity Deal.

Altman’s history with climate deniers goes back to the roots of his career. His mentor is Peter Thiel, Paypal founder and CEO of data analytics software giant Palantir, who has a history of climate denialist statements. Thiel is also a long-time Trump donor, having given at least $1.75 million to Trump campaigns from 2016 to 2020.

The Palantir CEO has claimed climate science is “fake science,” has called climate activist Greta Thunberg the “anti-Christ,” and has funded a science journal that publishes climate denial.

In 2022, Altman also donated over $32,000 to climate denier Michael Shellenberger’s failed campaign for governor of California.

Shellenberger has made extensive claims denying the severity of climate change, including that “humans are not causing a ‘sixth mass extinction,’” “the Amazon is not ‘the lungs of the world,’” and “climate change is not making natural disasters worse.”

Shellenberger is well known for his advocacy for nuclear energy. When he announced his run for governor on the Joe Rogan podcast, he argued that “nuclear power is the future.”

Shellenberger’s views on nuclear power align with Altman’s own long-held positions on energy. In a 2015 blog on Altman’s personal website, he argued, “The 20th century was the century of carbon-based energy. I am confident the 22nd century is going to be the century of atomic energy.”

Altman then expresses doubt as to the energy sources of our own era: “I am unsure how the majority of the 21st century will be powered,” he wrote.",https://www.desmog.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Slide1.jpg,N,,2025-10-13 16:02:56.209909

It also deepens our collaboration with the state as we translate research into impactful climate solutions.”

The funding will support two geothermal network projects. One will expand the existing system at the Southampton campus library to serve additional buildings, and the other will establish a new network on the main campus connecting the Multidisciplinary Engineering and Neuro-AI buildings with the existing engineering complex.

“SUNY remains committed to helping Governor Hochul achieve the state’s climate goals, and thanks to her investment we will be able to transition the State University of New York at Buffalo, SUNY Purchase, and the State University of New York at Stony Brook to more efficient and sustainable energy sources,” said SUNY Chancellor John B. King Jr. “This funding will help SUNY meet its goal of reaching net zero greenhouse gas emissions and ensure students will have a brighter, more sustainable future.”

“Governor Hochul has made clear her commitment to supporting generational investments like the Sustainable Future Program to foster an improved quality of life for all New Yorkers,” said New York State Energy Research and Development Authority President and CEO Doreen M. Harris. “Cleaning the air we breathe while lowering energy costs by advancing renewable energy projects, zero-emission transportation options and energy efficient building upgrades provides communities across the state with a critical foundation for a sustainable future.”",https://news.stonybrook.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/apple-touch-icon-144x144-precomposed.png,N,,2025-10-13 13:02:14.405904

The collaboration is centred on Airbus's objective to lower its environmental footprint, with Siemens' Buildings business leading the contract, supported by Capgemini. This alliance combines expertise in sustainability and digitalisation to help achieve specific environmental targets.

The initiative is a component of a wider programme at Airbus to diminish its operational environmental impact. According to the programme's targets, Airbus aims for a 20% reduction in energy consumption and an 85% cut in Scope 1 and 2 stationary emissions by 2030.

As part of the agreement, Siemens will implement scalable decarbonisation solutions designed for selected Airbus manufacturing sites. The goal is to abate 80 kt of CO2e annually from 2030. These solutions, delivered with Capgemini, include renewable energy integration, smart energy management and low-carbon heat systems.

A Strategic Alliance for Industrial Resilience

Capgemini's role in the initial phase involves consulting activities, defining governance and supporting project management and planning. Capgemini also contributes its experience in the digitalisation and automation of energy monitoring and measurement systems, a critical component for modern manufacturing facilities.

Susanne Seitz, CEO of Buildings at Siemens Smart Infrastructure, says: “Our collaboration with Airbus is built on years of mutual trust and shared ambition. It highlights Siemens’ capability to deliver smart and scalable technologies and services to reduce the carbon footprint of Airbus.”

Florent Massou dit Labaquere, EVP Operations of Airbus Commercial Aircraft, says the agreement will “keep Airbus on the right path”.

He adds: “We’re proud to be taking this important step toward making our operations more energy-efficient and future-ready. Collaborating with trusted partners is key in building a more resilient industrial footprint. The site-specific expertise from our Airbus colleagues in the UK and the US combined with Siemens’ technical know-how will keep us on the path toward meeting our energy use and emission reduction targets.”

A Roadmap to Greener Operations

The project's initial phase commenced in the summer of 2025, focusing on the creation of decarbonisation roadmaps for each manufacturing location. Following this, engineering studies will inform the implementation process, with the rollout of new infrastructure scheduled to begin in 2026. Siemens may also take on the operation and maintenance of this infrastructure to ensure long-term efficiency.

Seitz adds: “At Siemens, we’re committed to making the energy transition not only sustainable, but also achievable and scalable, so that Airbus and other industrial leaders can confront climate challenges while boosting operational resilience and long-term competitiveness.”

This long-standing relationship between Siemens and Airbus, which spans over fifty years, has previously included collaborations in factory automation and industrial software.

The brand is about to launch the all-electric version of its iconic Twingo, which promises a starting price of around 17,000, directly challenging the low-cost models that have flooded the market.

The announcement has generated a lot of uncertainty about the level and quality of this new car and at the same time, there is doubt about whether it can really be a competition for electric car companies that have been in the market for some time and have a certain advantage.

Renault changes its strategy

This radical change in Renault's strategy is based on the widespread adoption of lithium iron phosphate battery chemistry. Unlike the nickel-manganese-cobalt batteries traditionally used in Europe, these offer unavoidable advantages in terms of stability, service life and, crucially, cost. According to the company, this technological transition will allow a reduction of up to 40% in the production costs of its new electric cars.

The decision to embrace this new technology is a direct response to growing economic pressure from Chinese manufacturers such as BYD, MG and Leapmotor, who have used these cheaper batteries to offer competitive vehicles on the continent.

""To take advantage of our French roots and become the leader in Europe

Luca de Meo, Chief Executive Officer of Renault Group

Renault Group CEO Luca de Meo managed this strategic vision at the launch of the Ampere sub-brand in 2023, whose mission is not only to develop vehicle software, but also to ensure that affordability is the driver of mass adoption of electric mobility.

A competitive approach for Renault

Luca de Meo was excited and confident about the brand's new initiative and asked his own question: ""Creating a new business model specialising in electric vehicles and software that works from today: what better way to illustrate our revolution and the boldness of our teams?"".

De Meo was the one who answered his own question: ""Instilling a sustainable corporate vision and ensuring that it is reflected in each and every process and product.

But Michigan’s economic challenges go far beyond the loss of economic development dollars in the new budget.
That should be top of mind for Whitmer and lawmakers as they rework Michigan’s economic development strategy.","Michigan’s $81 billion budget axes much of state government’s economic development spending, including Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s signature program designed to aid automakers’ transition to electric vehicles, which isn’t going so well.

Business lobbying groups that represent thousands of employers are exasperated.

The fiscal 2026 budget, heavily driven by the road repair and public safety priorities of Trumpian state House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township), ends funding for the Strategic Outreach and Attraction Reserve Fund, or SOAR.

SOAR was created by Whitmer and the Legislature in 2021 as a panicked response to Ford Motor Co. blindsiding the state by announcing a record $11.4 billion investment in a battery plant and vehicle assembly plant in Tennessee and two battery plants in Kentucky.

Lawmakers dropped $500 million from the corporate income tax into the SOAR fund in each of the past three years. But the new budget allocates no new cash for the business attraction fund.

Hall, who in an interview earlier this year complained that Michigan CEOs have gone “woke,” said whatever might replace SOAR will “end the days of cash giveaways, once and for all.”

The budget also cuts $40.7 billion from business attraction and community development money administered by the Michigan Economic Development Corp., just over 40% of the $100 million allocated in the fiscal 2025 budget that ended Sept. 30.

Lawmakers also nixed $10 million Whitmer requested to implement population growth recommendations from her 2023 Growing Michigan Together Council report.

“These incentives have made the state a more attractive place to do business,” MichAuto, an arm of the Detroit Regional Chamber that promotes the state’s auto industry, said in a statement. “(W)ithout an attractive suite of incentives, or a closing fund, Michigan businesses are at a disadvantage compared to national competitors with more resources of this sort.”

The cuts run so deep that the MEDC put out a news release telling the world it’s still in business.

What’s happening here is a growing bipartisan discontent over the value of business attraction incentives to create a significant number of good-paying jobs at a time when Michigan’s workforce is shrinking and the state is becoming steadily poorer compared to most states.

Michigan has fallen to 40th in per capita income, its lowest ranking ever, and slightly lower than the adjoining states of Indiana, Ohio and Wisconsin.

Minnesota’s per capita income of $74,943 in 2024 led the Great Lakes states last year, while Illinois was second at $74,197. Michigan trailed far behind at $63,221.

Business lobbying groups claim other changes and cuts in the new state budget will make it harder for them to develop talent and invest in innovations.

The budget cuts $22 million from the Going Pro Talent Fund, which gives job training grants to businesses.

And it decouples state and federal business taxes so that businesses won’t be able to take advantage of accelerated deduction schedules for capital expenditures under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act on their state taxes.

Decoupling prevents state government from losing $2 billion over the next five years, money it plans to spend on roads. A coalition of business groups regards the decoupling as a massive tax hike that will make investing in Michigan more expensive than in other states.

The “budget lands as our employers face a disproportionate risk from tariffs, the trade war and increasing uncertainty around electrification policies . . . adding further financial strain to many of our hometown companies,” Detroit Regional CEO Sandy Baruah said in a statement.

But Michigan’s economic challenges go far beyond the loss of economic development dollars in the new budget. The state has been losing ground to competing states for decades, regardless of which political party has controlled Lansing.

It’s long past time for policymakers to chart a new course for the state’s economy.

They can start by finally recognizing that chasing factory jobs is not the path to prosperity. Policymakers (and many of the rest of us) have a hard time accepting that the economy has shifted to services where most middle-class jobs are in labs and offices, not plant floors.

It was quite a tell when Ford Motor Co. CEO Jim Farley recently said some of the automakers’ younger hourly workers told him they needed three jobs to make ends meet. Even the “old-timers” told Farley that working in the company’s plants is no longer a viable career.

Despite President Donald Trump’s ballyhooed effort to restore manufacturing by hitting imported goods with stiff tariffs, the U.S. has lost 78,000 manufacturing jobs since August 2024. Michigan accounted for 9,000 of those lost jobs in that period.

These evaluations include unreasonable risks to a potentially exposed or susceptible subpopulation identified as relevant to the risk evaluation under the specified conditions of use (COUs).
Notably, if the proposed rule is finalized and subsequently challenged, as anticipated, the courts will not defer to either of the EPA’s interpretations.
The proposed rule would allow the EPA to consider occupational exposure controls, such as personal protective equipment (PPE) and industrial engineering controls, in chemical risk evaluations and risk determinations—something previously prohibited under the 2017 rule.
4 “Weight of scientific evidence” means “an approach to scientific evaluation in which each piece of relevant information is considered based on its quality and relevance, and then transparently integrated with other relevant information to inform the scientific evaluation prior to making a judgment about the scientific evaluation.","The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has proposed a new rule to revise how it evaluates the risks of chemicals currently in use under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). This initiative follows a review prompted by Executive Order 14219 and aims to streamline evaluations while aligning with the current administration’s interpretation of TSCA. In response to concerns from the chemical industry and other stakeholders about the burden and complexity of the current risk evaluation process, the proposed modifications aim to streamline evaluations, increase transparency, and ensure a more predictable regulatory process for manufacturers (including importers) of chemical substances.

TSCA requires the EPA to prioritize and evaluate high-priority substances from the TSCA inventory. Risk evaluations under TSCA are primarily initiated by the EPA, either through its prioritization process or in response to manufacturer requests.1 These evaluations are triggered by statutory requirements, emerging scientific evidence, or industry interest in clearing regulatory uncertainty around specific chemicals.2

The EPA uses risk evaluations to determine whether an existing chemical poses an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment—based solely on scientific risk, not costs or other nonrisk factors. These evaluations include unreasonable risks to a potentially exposed or susceptible subpopulation identified as relevant to the risk evaluation under the specified conditions of use (COUs). COUS are the circumstances under which a chemical is intended, known, or reasonably foreseen to be manufactured, processed, distributed, used, or disposed of.

The EPA initially issued its procedural framework rule in 2017 and then revised it in 2024 under the Biden administration to require a single, comprehensive risk determination for each chemical across all COUs. EPA wants to return to evaluating each COU separately, reversing the 2024 rule and returning to the approach established during the first Trump administration.3 The EPA is seeking public comment on whether the procedural framework rule should include regulatory text specifying that the EPA has discretion to exclude COUs, exposure pathways, and routes and to coordinate actions with other EPA-administered laws to ensure that chemical risks “could be eliminated or reduced to a sufficient extent” by other EPA actions, as permitted under TSCA section 9(b). Notably, if the proposed rule is finalized and subsequently challenged, as anticipated, the courts will not defer to either of the EPA’s interpretations. Instead, they will focus on determining the best interpretation of the statute consistent with the Supreme Court’s recent decision in Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo, 603 U.S. 369 (2024).

The proposed rule would allow the EPA to consider occupational exposure controls, such as personal protective equipment (PPE) and industrial engineering controls, in chemical risk evaluations and risk determinations—something previously prohibited under the 2017 rule. This change could reduce findings of unreasonable risk in well-controlled workplace settings. Additionally, the rule would modify the regulatory definitions section in numerous ways, including by eliminating “overburdened communities” from the list of “potentially exposed or susceptible subpopulations” that must be considered in evaluations and by incorporating the definition of “weight of scientific evidence” from Section 2(e) of Executive Order 14303. These changes would influence how the EPA evaluates scientific data in its regulatory decisions.4

Finally, as proposed, the rule would require manufacturers (including importers) requesting a risk evaluation to submit less information and only that which is relevant to the COU or COUs identified in the risk evaluation request. These procedural changes would apply to all risk evaluations initiated on or after the date of the final rule and, to the extent practicable, to risk evaluations that are in process as of the date of the final rule but not yet finalized.

The deadline for submitting comments on the proposed rule is 7 November 2025.5

1 Section 6(b)(2) of TSCA, 15 U.S.C. 2605(b)(2), (4)(C)(ii). The EPA must always have at least 20 high-priority and 20 low-priority chemicals in process.

2 Section §6(b)(4) of TSCA, 15 U.S.C. 2605(b)(4). A manufacturer or consortia of manufacturers can formally request a risk evaluation of a specific chemical substance by submitting a request with supporting information on the chemical’s conditions of use and by covering a percentage of the associated costs. The EPA has discretion to grant or deny the request.

The company revealed it has completed all baseline studies required under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), a crucial step before formal environmental reviews and government permitting can begin. The reports were officially filed with the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM), since the Tonopah Flats project sits on federally managed land.

According to a company spokesperson, this milestone marks the completion of more than two years of intensive work and comprehensive third-party environmental evaluations. The achievement represents a crucial advancement in establishing domestic lithium production capabilities that will help support the United States’ electric vehicle manufacturing and battery technology objectives.

Paving the Way for U.S. Lithium Independence

Lithium — often called “white gold” — is a critical component of modern electric vehicle (EV) batteries. As global demand accelerates, analysts say projects like Tonopah Flats could play a vital role in reducing America’s reliance on imported materials from China and South America.

American Battery’s Tonopah Flats site is among the largest known lithium claystone deposits in the country. The company has emphasized that its sustainable extraction process and domestic production model could make it a cornerstone of America’s green manufacturing future.

The baseline studies, conducted in partnership with environmental consultants and local agencies, analyzed key factors such as air quality, wildlife, hydrology, and cultural resources — all prerequisites for moving into the environmental impact assessment phase.

A Stock on Fire

Following the announcement, ABAT stock quickly became the top-trending equity on Stocktwits, with retail investor sentiment spiking into what the platform described as “extremely bullish” territory.

Trading volume surged as social media investors celebrated the company’s progress toward commercialization — a milestone many viewed as a turning point in the race to establish U.S.-based lithium supply chains.

The stock traded over 34% higher by late morning, with momentum fueled by optimism that the NEPA completion will accelerate permit approvals and potential partnerships.

The Bigger Picture: America’s Battery Boom

The development also comes as the Biden administration pushes for greater domestic sourcing of clean energy minerals, a key part of its climate and manufacturing policies. With electric vehicle adoption soaring, demand for lithium is projected to triple by 2030, according to industry analysts.

A market analyst emphasized that obtaining domestic lithium sources has moved beyond being a choice to becoming a critical requirement for maintaining national competitiveness. The expert noted that American Battery’s advancement establishes the company as a significant player in the ongoing energy transition.

Other major players, including Lithium Americas and Albemarle, have also made headlines in recent months for similar U.S.-based projects, but American Battery’s speed and visibility have drawn particular attention from both institutional and retail investors.

Next Steps for Tonopah Flats

Now that baseline studies are complete, the company will proceed to the formal environmental review and public comment phase — steps that could determine the project’s long-term timeline.

While still early in development, American Battery’s leadership remains confident.The company explained that its operations at Tonopah Flats extend far beyond traditional mining activities, emphasizing that the work encompasses innovation, sustainability practices, and the development of energy independence for the nation.

For investors, the next few months may prove decisive. Analysts suggest that a smooth regulatory process could open the door to partnerships, financing, or even early offtake agreements with battery manufacturers.

Wind continues to be the largest source of renewable energy in Michigan, accounting for 67% of renewable generation.
Solar generation continues to grow rapidly in Michigan, accounting for 18% of renewable generation in 2023, the report found.
Even so, that deep red MAGA support hasn’t slowed the state’s move to embrace renewable energy and microgrids on multiple levels.","Renewable energy support at the federal level may be facing an aggressive backlash from the Trump Administration, but several large states—some of which helped elect the president—are still embracing solar, wind and energy storage.

California, Michigan and Texas recently touted their major expansions in alternative energy projects. These come despite moves by the Trump Administration to end federal tax incentives for clean energy projects and terminate previously approved funding for renewable, carbon capture and other decarbonization works.

The renewable energy drive in California is hardly a surprise, but the scope of funding remains impressive.

“While Trump bets on the past, California is building the future,” said Gov. Gavin Newsom in a statement within the report by the California Energy Commission (CEC). “Regressive energy policy may play well on Fox News, but it’s plain bad economics. Today it costs more to run a dirty fossil fuel power plant than to build a brand-new clean energy facility.

“The markets know where the future is headed — and so do we,” the California governor added. “Clean, green, reliable power—that’s California’s bet, and we’re already winning it.”

Last week, the CEC approved $136 million new decarbonizing energy and climate technology investments. The state is first nationwide in solar installations and working on other projects involving utility-scale battery storage, hydrogen and microgrids.

California, of course, is among the bluest of blue states and rejected Trump three times in presidential elections. Michigan, however, is more reddish purple and voted for Trump two out of three times, in the 2016 and 2024 races.

Even so, Michigan is proving to be open to renewable and distributed energy resource programs. The state’s Public Service Commission (MPSC) has reported on the continued growth of renewable and DER projects.

The MPSC’s Status of Renewable Energy, Distributed Generation, and Legacy Net Metering in Michigan report finds that electric utilities regulated by the MPSC had more than 7,500 MW (7.5 GW) of renewable capacity at the end of 2024 and more than 8,300 MW expected by the end of 2025, based on contracts approved by the Commission. Utilities added 1,698 MW of renewable energy in 2024, an increase of 28.9% over the 5882 MW of renewable capacity that was online at the end of 2023.

That figure is expected to reach 17,800 MW by 2030 as renewable energy expands to meet the standards set in Michigan’s energy laws revamped in 2023, according to the MPSC report. The amount of renewable generation in service statewide will exceed that number because utilities not regulated by the MPSC aren’t required to submit renewable energy contracts to the Commission.

Wind continues to be the largest source of renewable energy in Michigan, accounting for 67% of renewable generation. Solar generation continues to grow rapidly in Michigan, accounting for 18% of renewable generation in 2023, the report found.

Michigan’s electric providers were required to meet a 15% renewable portfolio standard by 2021. With the passage of the revamped energy laws in 2023, electric providers are now required to meet a 50% renewable portfolio by 2030 and 60% by 2035.

Among the Michigan report’s other highlights: The generation capacity of Michigan’s distributed generation program increased to 222.4 MW in 2024 from 189.6 MW in 2023, a more than 17% increase.

Texas, meanwhile, is the reddest and red states and has resoundingly supported Trump three times. In fact, the Lone Star State hasn’t voted for a Democrat for president since Jimmy Carter in 1976.

Even so, that deep red MAGA support hasn’t slowed the state’s move to embrace renewable energy and microgrids on multiple levels. Part of this trend is driven by a desire for a diverse generation portfolio to defend the sometimes-challenged Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) grid from resource inadequacy and outages in the fast-growing state.

Texas is, by far, the nation’s leading installer of utility-scale wind power. Installed capacity of utility-scale battery storage also is rapidly expanding from Beaumont to El Paso and Dallas to Houston, having grown a stunning 4,100% to 5,707 MW (5.7 GW) in the previous four years.

“Excluding California, Texas has more battery storage than the rest of the United States combined, accounting for over 32% of all the capacity installed nationwide,” reads a report from the Texas State Comptroller’s Office. “Fast permitting processes and a vast amount of land—mainstays of Texas’ low regulation, business-friendly environment and the same features that have allowed wind and solar power to thrive in Texas — make it easier for developers to enter the battery storage market. Furthermore, the global price of lithium-ion batteries has plunged 82% over the past 10 years as raw material prices decreased, and demand softened more than expected.”

California still rules in solar installed capacity, but Texas is gaining fast and outpaced the Golden State last year. Solar capacity in Texas is rising beyond 45,000 MW which is getting close to 10% of the total generation resource mix within ERCOT and other Texas grid connections.","https://img.energytech.com/files/base/ebm/energytech/image/2025/10/68ed13855e790c3ec0569583-dreamstime_ai_us_map.png?auto=format,compress&fit=fill&fill=blur&w=1200&h=630",N,,2025-10-13 13:03:43.877930

But FlowGen, a producer of small wind turbines based in Zug, Switzerland, has numerous microgrids in Europe that include wind-among them one at the Munich International Airport–and two projects underway in the US, at a telecommunications company and in a separate company’s solar fields.

Microgrid power at 6 cents/kWh to 8 cents/kWh

Company CEO Dirk Kuester said that FlowGen microgrids, which include solar, wind, energy storage–and sometimes fuel cells–can deliver subsidy-free power at 6 cents/kWh to 8 cents/kWh and commission the units within three to five months.

In the U.S., wind generation deployment achieved record highs in April 2024, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. But President Trump has tried to stamp out the technology by phasing out the Inflation Reduction Act’s investment tax credit and canceling funding for projects.

Kuester offered the Munich International Airport project as an example of why it’s a good idea to build microgrids that include wind, solar and energy storage.

How wind and solar help each other out in a microgrid

In general, wind and solar complement each other. Solar produces energy during the day, while wind is more likely to yield it at night.

“This is the best efficiency mix for microgrids,” Kuester said.

To meet the goals of its “Net Zero 2035” strategy, the Munich airport was looking for ways to provide clean, resilient power for electric vehicle (EV) charging. The airport’s challenge was meeting high electricity consumption for EV charging, lighting and ground operations with a low-footprint option. It sought a system that could generate renewable energy on site, store enough energy to ensure continuous operations and support EV charging infrastructure.

FlowGen provided a containerized microgrid that integrated wind, solar and energy storage. It includes three 15-kW FlowGen small-scale wind turbines mounted on a mobile container, 10 kW of solar PV panels installed on the roof of the container, energy storage and the infrastructure needed to charge four to six EVs a day. The system generates up to 200 kWh daily on sunny and windy days, powering EV charging stations in the car rental parking area, Kuester said.

When the EVs aren’t being driven, it’s possible to use their batteries to add storage capacity to the microgrid, he said.

Wind-based microgrids to cut diesel use for the U.K. Ministry of Defense

FlowGen is also working on a trial project with the U.K. Ministry of Defense aimed at replacing diesel generators with mobile microgrids to charge drones, Kuester said. Avoiding diesel use is important because the diesel transportation vehicles could potentially be bombed, he said.

“You can use the microgrids to charge drones anywhere, and you don’t see them or hear them,” he said.

For the military, the microgrids can also charge cybersecurity systems so they don’t experience outages.

Focusing on telecom, cell towers and large-scale energy users

In June 2021, FlowGen announced a deal granting microgrid company CleanSpark exclusive distribution rights to FlowGen’s wind turbine products in North and South America. At the time, the companies were focusing on telecom operations, cell towers and data centers. CleanSpark said that it expected about 70% of wind-powered microgrids to include solar.

FlowGen is targeting high-cost energy markets, low-cost energy markets where remote off-grid power is needed and large-scale users, according to a recent company press release. Its projects include a Norwegian test center for powering offshore oil platforms and Niedersachsen Ports, the operator of state-owned ports in Germany.

FlowGen is not alone in the wind, solar and storage microgrid space

FlowGen isn’t the only company offering microgrids that include wind power. IBIS Power, based in the Netherlands, offers a system called PowerNest — a modular unit that combines solar, wind and energy management in an architecture that can be used on building rooftops, where turbulence around the rooftop makes energy production inefficient.

The IBIS system overcomes the turbulence challenge and maximizes renewable energy production, the company said. The unit, which is placed on a building’s roof, has internal wind turbines and solar panels on the top. PowerNest works to remove the turbulence around a building by capturing the wind, then bending it inward, accelerating it and guiding it through the wind turbine.

Bergey Windpower focuses on off-grid hybrid microgrids as a way to reduce the use of diesel, increase renewable energy deployment and cut wear and tear on batteries.

California-based Air Voltaics offers small to midsize wind turbines for microgrids and says that wind turbines require less space than solar panels. Together with solar panels, they create a more reliable energy supply, according to the company.

FlowGen has its eye on the U.S. market, Kuester said.

“We see the U.S. market as the biggest market as energy demand reaches its targets,” he said.","https://img.microgridknowledge.com/files/base/ebm/microgridknowledge/image/2025/10/68ed168b39bfa5643600a0cc-flowgen_munich_airport_2.png?auto=format,compress&fit=fill&fill=blur&w=1200&h=630",N,,2025-10-13 12:06:21.587533

The International Maritime Organization’s updated greenhouse gas strategy sets a net-zero ambition “by or around 2050,” with waypoints for 2030 and 2040, and an expectation that zero or near-zero fuels begin showing up in meaningful volumes by 2030. Regional policies are already operational, as is interim IMO guidance, which also locks in a well-to-wake1 view of emissions.

Multiple decarbonization pathways are advancing, through efficiency upgrades, route optimization, alternative fuels and onboard capture. But near-term progress depends on access to compliant molecules at scale, with defensible lifecycle carbon and recognized certification. Capital will back options that leverage existing assets while other technologies mature. That is where ethanol is relevant.

The U.S. operates a large, export-ready ethanol infrastructure with roughly 18 billion gallons of nameplate capacity, steady production and record exports of near 2 billion gallons last year. Plants, rail, barge and port connections exist today. That footprint can support marine supply chains now and, where needed, feed conversion processes that yield candidate blendstocks for the distillate pool.

Methanol has driven real momentum in alternative-fuel newbuilds and retrofits. Public sources indicate by mid-2024, methanol accounted for roughly 9% of the global orderbook by vessel count (about 242 ships)2. As of early 2025, around 60 methanol-fueled vessels were in operation and about 340 were on order3. Industry materials also referenced roughly 700 “methanol-ready”4 designs5. That installed base is valuable infrastructure for alcohol fuels in general, and ethanol complements it. Ethanol and methanol are both simple alcohols with similar handling and safety requirements under the IMO’s low-flashpoint rules, so the same broad tank, piping, ventilation and detection concepts apply. That platform overlap makes methanol-capable designs a logical starting point for ethanol with original equipment manufacturer (OEM) calibration and targeted material changes. On a volumetric basis, ethanol offers higher energy density, helping extend range or reduce tankage. For owners and charterers, dual-fuel optionality across both alcohols diversifies feedstock risk, broadens sourcing and strengthens the procurement stack without forcing a binary choice.

With methanol-capable platforms now common, ethanol slots in as an add-on rather than a redesign. OEMs are already running compression-ignition trials with a pilot fuel, and the same IMO low-flashpoint rules apply. The near-term fit is controllable fleets through harbor craft, inland towboats and offshore support. This is where ethanol’s ultra-low sulfur/aromatics and particulate reductions matter; the known trade-offs versus marine gasoil (materials and energy density) can be handled with selective seal/line upgrades and engine control unit recalibration, then taken through testbeds, class approval and sea trials.

Is nuclear power becoming cool in Colorado?

The state has had only one nuclear power plant, Fort St. Vrain near Platteville. And it was converted to natural gas in 1989 after 10 years of technical problems. The former Rocky Flats weapons plant, which produced plutonium triggers for nuclear bombs, drew thousands of protesters for years to the site north of Denver, including such prominent activists as Daniel Ellsberg and Beat poet Allen Ginsberg.

In 2004, Colorado voters were the first in the country to approve a renewable energy mandate for utilities. How has nuclear power, with its baggage of radioactive waste and the Three Mile Island partial meltdown, become a seriously considered option in today’s fuel mix?

Worry about the demand for electricity outstripping capacity and concerns about progress on cutting greenhouse gas emissions led state Rep. Alex Valdez, a Denver Democrat, to back legislation this year that defines nuclear power as “clean.” He sponsored House Bill 25-1040, which added nuclear to the energy sources that utilities can use to meet state clean energy targets.

“As a kid, I grew up in the ’80s when a lot of talk about nuclear was in relation to the weaponry that was pointed at each other between the Soviet Union and the United States,” Valdez said. “I think I just kind of lumped nuclear into the same conversations as most people do: around its negative uses, less desirable uses.”

Valdez got a different perspective when he was appointed to the nuclear working group at the National Conference of State Legislatures. The group visited France, which gets about 70% of its electricity from nuclear power. Roughly 19% of electricity in the U.S. comes from nuclear energy.

With some forecasts showing electricity demand rising dramatically, Valdez said the U.S. will have to add “a tremendous amount of energy” to the grid if it’s going to compete in quantum computing and other advanced technology.

A boom in data center construction driven by increasing the use of artificial intelligence is expected to escalate the need for more electricity generation.

Valdez, who spent most of his career in the renewable energy field, said the legislation he sponsored recognizes that the power generated by nuclear energy is carbon-free. “As we move toward our path to zero-carbon (energy), it can be included in the mix to get us there.”

Not ready for prime time

A lot of the current interest in nuclear power revolves around a new technology: small modular nuclear reactors, about one-tenth to one quarter the size of a conventional reactor. They’re billed as potentially less expensive, safer, easier to build and adaptable because modules can be added as more power is needed.

The technology is also still in the development and demonstration stage. Just a few are operating in China and Russia. No small modular reactors –SMRs– are in commercial use in the U.S.

“SMRs aren’t ready for prime time,” said Dennis Wamsted, an analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. “You will hear from developers and others about the advantages. The advantages right now are all on paper.”

The institute focuses on research into the economics of expanding the use of renewable energy.

“We are not fans of nuclear power because it costs too much and that cost has been consistently high over the years. We see no track record of it declining,” Wamsted said. “We certainly don’t see that happening with a new class of reactor that nobody’s built before and nobody’s run before.”

Noah Rott, a spokesman for the western region of the Sierra Club, said the environmental group feels that discussion around nuclear energy “is largely a distraction as utilities work to address electric load growth in the next decade.”

“Cleaner sources like wind, solar, demand response, energy efficiency and storage are the answer here,” Rott said in an email.

However, the concept of an energy source that can run 24/7 and emit no heat-trapping greenhouse gases when generating power is compelling. Denver International Airport CEO Phil Washington and Denver Mayor Mike Johnston said in August that the airport, the country’s third-busiest, planned to commission a study to explore the feasibility of building a small, modular nuclear reactor on its campus to meet the growing demand for electricity in the area and cut the use of carbon-emitting power.

The airport put the study on hold after complaints that city officials hadn’t talked to area residents first. The airport determined that a broader scope will best serve its interests and needs and will issue a request for information later this fall on multiple clean energy solutions, including reactors, after first receiving ideas and input from the community, spokeswoman Courtney Law said in an email Wednesday.

Nuclear power generation is the top choice of a local advisory committee for replacing coal at Xcel Energy’s Comanche power plants near Pueblo. Xcel has proposed tapping renewable energy, battery storage and natural gas when it stops burning coal by 2031.

But the Pueblo Innovative Energy Solutions Advisory Committee, established by Xcel and community members, said renewable energy facilities wouldn’t provide the same number of jobs and tax revenue for local governments that nuclear or gas facilities would. The committee is promoting installing SMRs.

Xcel Energy operates nuclear facilities in Minnesota and has said they’re not off the table for Colorado, but the new type of reactors likely won’t be commercially available when the utility has to replace its coal plants.

The Western Governors Association, WGA, held workshops in September at the Idaho National Laboratory, which focuses largely on nuclear energy.

The workshops were part of an initiative by Utah Gov. Spencer Cox called “Energy Superabundance: Unlocking Prosperity in the West.” Cox, the WGA’s chairman this year, said the country is looking to the West for ways to meet the surge in need for more electricity.

Idaho Gov. Brad Little said during a workshop that the U.S. won’t meet its energy needs “with our legacy energy.”

“We’re going to have to have scalable, safe nuclear energy,” Little said.

While it could be five to 10 years before small reactors are up and running in the U.S., Mark Jensen, a chemistry professor at the Colorado School of Mines, said the federal government is more involved in promoting nuclear energy than in the recent past. He noted that the Department of Energy has opened federal sites to allow companies to test prototypes and that could help streamline development.

President Donald Trump has issued executive orders intended to invigorate the nuclear power industry and streamline regulations.

Jensen, director of the nuclear science and engineering program at the School of Mines, said more private money is flowing into nuclear projects than he has seen over the past 35 years.

Wind, solar the ‘workhorses’

Jack Waldorf, WGA executive director, said in an email that advancements in nuclear energy provide the opportunity to expand clean, reliable generation of electricity, but achieving true energy abundance will require a comprehensive approach.

Gov. Jared Polis said in a statement that Colorado has a history as an innovator and nuclear energy should be no different. ” As projects become cost competitive and safer, we should view nuclear energy not as a competing energy source to wind and solar, but as a complementary solution for better overall reliability and lower costs.”

Will Toor, executive director of the Colorado Energy Office, agreed. He said as Colorado moves to more deeply cut emissions, other technologies will be needed and nuclear energy should certainly be in the mix.

“It’s pretty clear that wind and solar will be the workhorses of the grid just looking at the cost modeling,” Toor said. “You can build them relatively quickly and they’re so much cheaper than other resources.”

He expects nuclear power to be in a group of what he calls “clean, firm” energy sources: ones that emit low or no greenhouse gases and provide round-the-clock power. Toor said geothermal energy is likely the furthest along among those sources.

“The challenge with nuclear is really still the same challenge that it has been for utilities, which is the cost, how long it takes to build and the uncertainties of federal permitting,” Toor said.

He added that he would be surprised if Colorado utilities moved ahead with conventional nuclear or “to be first in line for the first-of-its-kind” small modular reactor.",https://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/TDP-L-img1332A_115195150.jpg?w=1024&h=717,N,,2025-10-13 13:02:44.535929

Read the rest of the series here.

Last October, Withlacoochee River Electric Cooperative needed help and the Boy Scouts came to the rescue.

One of the nation’s largest co-ops, Withlacoochee usually rides out storms with its own staff, as it did with Hurricane Helene. Twelve days later, Milton roared across its Florida territory, causing monumental flooding and damage, and the co-op finalized a tent city to house hundreds of outside lineworkers. But the night before operations kicked in, the base camp contractor informed Withlacoochee that it would be unable to feed the crews breakfast a few hours later.

Enter the Boy Scouts and their encampment at Spring Hill, 30 miles northwest of the co-op’s Dade City headquarters. From stores near and far, Withlacoochee bought food to nourish 600 men. Overnight, employees, community members, and Ranger Daniel Tremblay and his wife stepped in to help. On the morning of Oct. 10, breakfast was served.

“Out of the Boy Scouts kitchen, we started feeding. They came in, cooked and helped us feed when we didn’t have any other help,” said David Lambert, executive vice president and general manager at Withlacoochee. “We’d long supported scouting and supported their mission. Never in my lifetime did I think we would need to use their facilities as a base camp to help us.”

Partnerships between co-ops and their communities are essential components of power restoration and even more so when one of the worst storms ever to hit you is immediately followed by the worst.

Warm-up hurricanes

In September and October, Helene and Milton delivered a one-two punch to Withlacoochee, which serves about 270,000 members across five central Florida counties—and add Debby in early August to make it a one-two-three blow.

“It was unimaginable, let’s just put it that way,” Lambert said. “We had just come off of Debby and that caused a little bit of coastal flooding, primarily in our farthest north county, Citrus. Then, a month later, we had Hurricane Helene and it was a wall of water on the coast. Some homes had 18 feet of water in them.”

As Helene moved north and waters surged, Lambert and his staff watched from the Dade City control center as four feet of water swept into a substation on U.S. 19 near the coast. Co-op crews were on the scene almost immediately because there was no time to waste—in addition to bringing back power to 110,000 members, Helene became a matter of saving lives and property.

“When the water recedes, the clock is ticking,” said Gary Steele, manager of member relations. “You’ve got to get that drywall out. You’ve got to get that carpet up. You’ve got to get all those appliances out of the house. You’ve got to get it dry so you lose as little as possible.”

With a Herculean effort, Withlacoochee had almost all lines repaired within 48 hours. However, officials in one county wouldn’t let the co-op flip the switch to damaged homes until they passed an electrical inspection. Knowing electricity was essential to the drying process, Withlacoochee got thousands of meters ready to roll as soon as it got the go-ahead and worked behind the scenes to expedite the process.

“We would have that account back up as soon as we got the release [from the county] because we knew that people were literally standing outside those homes with all their belongings, their toothbrush, their TV and every ounce of clothes they had on the curb,” Steele said. “They had fans and were waiting on power to turn on those fans and dry the two-by-fours in the house.”

On its social media sites and in interviews, Withlacoochee established itself as a go-to communications hub to help members and non-members navigate the procedure to get their meters spinning.

“We’re so involved in the community. We believe we are the No. 1 trusted partner in our community,” Lambert said. “We build strong communities. Anybody can provide electricity. We build strong communities. That’s our whole philosophy.”

Milton tested that philosophy.

One-of-a-kind storm

Withlacoochee felt so confident about post-Helene repairs that it prepared to send crews to Georgia co-ops still staggered by the Category 4 hurricane. Lambert headed to an NRECA Regional Meeting in South Carolina and got as far as Jacksonville when his phone sounded an alert.

What was thought to be a tropical storm was turning into something much worse. Milton rapidly strengthened on Oct. 7, becoming one of the most intense Atlantic hurricanes on record with winds of 180 mph. Lambert made a U-turn and, by 11 a.m., was sitting with Steele and staff members calling contractors and arranging for support.

“By that night, the reports were that it was going to be a Category 3 or 4,” Steele said. “It kept getting worse and worse as the hours ticked by and it was amazing how quickly a storm that was supposed to be nothing more than just a little bit of wind and rain turned into the worst storm we’ve ever seen.”

From the control center, they had watched Helene flood coastal communities. On Oct. 9, Milton, now a Category 3, flooded them. The Dade City control center is underground, a little like a bomb shelter. Water started pouring through the bottom floor. The staff tried to keep one eye on the cameras while catching water in buckets. Tree after tree fell outside the corporate office. Staffers sawed their way to freedom.

“The water damage was so bad that we lost all communications to all of our substations and we have our own fiber network,” Lambert said. “This office used to be covered in gigantic oak trees. You hardly see any here. We couldn’t even get out of the building. It was that bad.”

The scene at the control center was repeated time and again across Withlacoochee’s service area, wind and water damage on a scale unseen in its 78-year history. Almost 204,000 members were without power. At one point, Milton spawned an estimated 26 tornados in the territory.

But Helene came first, and co-ops from Georgia to Kentucky were still soaking up all available manpower and resources. In 2023, when Lambert took over as general manager, he started to review and add contracts for storm assistance as a measure of security. “We had 15 storm contracts. We started calling every single one of those folks because we knew Milton was coming in. We got to the eighth storm contract before anybody would even pick up the phone.”

That’s when partnerships came into play. For the first time, Withlacoochee couldn’t handle a storm on its own. Lambert called Katherine Domingue, CEO and general manager at SLEMCO in Lafayette, Louisiana. Within hours, a team of 30 SLEMCO lineworkers was on its way, escorted onto the highway by the Louisiana State Police. “It was probably one of the biggest reliefs we had had when Katherine picked up the phone at SLEMCO and said, ‘Absolutely, we’ll send you help,’” Lambert said.

Crews from Central City-based DEMCO, which abuts SLEMCO, and co-ops in Texas and Arkansas soon followed. In all, about 2,000 lineworkers and related personnel were on the ground at Withlacoochee. “I get goose bumps about it because we love and appreciate all the crews that came to help,” Lambert added.

The challenge they faced was stunning. Crews chopped through 200-year-old oak trees and waded through waist-high water just to get downed wires. Contractors from as far away as California and Canada supplemented crews from Withlacoochee and other co-ops. Restoration required specialized equipment from contractors in Georgia.

“One piece of equipment would get stuck and they would be bringing another one right behind it with winches to get it out. Then we would have to bring in track dozers to get even further into certain areas,” Lambert said.

A video of DEMCO crews went viral worldwide. Three lineworkers are up to their chests in water in what used to be a neighborhood when another suddenly surfaces, drenched but clutching the piece of cable for which he dove underwater.

“We knew it was going to be bad, but we never dreamed it was going to be as bad as it was. But we also never dreamed that we would be 95% restored in 70 hours, too,” said Lambert, adding that 100,000 members were back online within about 24 hours, thanks to skilled workers, multiple backfeeds and the Boy Scouts.

Tremblay and the Boy Scouts eagerly answered the call when Withlacoochee reached out about using their land and facilities as a makeshift camp for hundreds of lineworkers. Again, a relationship with meaning, Lambert noted, a reversal of roles from Withlacoochee’s long-term financial and resource support of Scouting America and the youth community.

After all, if incoming crews to Withlacoochee were not greeted with food and a welcoming attitude, things could have turned out differently, he said.

“Part of that is feeding them breakfast, relying on those relationships and getting those 600 people in the community on day one. That made a huge, huge, impact on our restoration. At a minimum, had we delayed those crews and got them later, that’s one more day our folks would have been without power.”

The forever flood

The hurricane had passed, but the nightmare was just beginning. Shamonique Simmons is part of the accounting department at Withlacoochee, where she started as a customer service representative 15 years ago. Simmons left her three-bedroom house in the Ridge Manor section of Hernando County to go to work on a Friday morning, 10 days post-Milton.

She would not see her house again for a month. Her neighborhood of 100 homes is surrounded by lakes that flooded over ridges and contours as the Green Swamp in central Florida drained the excess rain from Milton, feeding rivers and streams. Though her home was about 200 feet from a lake, three to four feet of water gushed into her property and washed away her world.

“I almost cried,” she said of the first time she was allowed to return to the property. “I had to hold it together, though. It was sad.” Simmons stayed with relatives; friends helped her trash everything and then worked on rebuilding this summer.

Gloria Blankenship, a soothing voice on the member services line for 24 years, lives in the same Lakewood subdivision, about a mile from the nearest lake. She was in her one-story house for 23 years until the remnants of Milton, 10 days later, kicked out her and her husband.

A friend displaced by the storm was staying with the Blankenships, who thought their home was on secure ground. As water rose, the friend called her—you need to get home; the water is rising.

“It’s never flooded in that area since I’ve been there. As soon as I started seeing it happen, I was a little in shock and so was that part of the neighborhood,” she said. “All I could think of is, ‘What do I need to grab and just get out of here?’” Blankenship said.

She considers herself fortunate because she retrieved some items and took on nine to 14 inches of water, less than some other residences. “You go through phases of rollercoaster rides. You’re like, ‘OK, I’ve got this, we’re almost there.’ And then you miss your house or miss being home,” said Blankenship, who moved into a travel trailer on her brother’s property before starting the process of rebuilding.

Their work helped them ease at least a little of the pain. “Working was the only thing that kept me really sane,” Simmons said. To Blankenship, going to the office helped take her mind off the situation. “Everybody is good about asking, ‘How are you doing, Gloria? How is it coming along?’ I love it here. I love this company.”

Simmons and Blankenship were two among many Withlacoochee staffers touched by the flood. One board member had six feet of water in his coastal home, Lambert noted. The co-op cut and cleared fallen trees so some of its employees could get to work.

“We’ve got a culture where we take care of our community. We take care of our employees because they’re like our family. Even though we have right at 600 employees, we are still a family. We’re not so big that we can’t take care of one another and then that hopefully is reflected in our relationships with our members,” Lambert said.

Storm-related costs for the double whammy of Helene and Milton totaled about $49 million, Lambert said, noting that the tab would have been even higher absent some of the system storm hardening Withlacoochee has undertaken in recent years. This summer, Withlacoochee has been part of hurricane expos and presentations designed to keep preparation on the top of the minds of its members.

“We’re really pushing the message for folks to be prepared, tell your neighbors to be prepared, know the things they can do to prepare and where they can get help because we know from Milton and Helene that they are going to need it,” Steele said.

“Be prepared” is the motto of the Boy Scouts and a value at Withlacoochee. On Nov. 1, nearly three weeks to the day after Milton struck, Withlacoochee hosted a breakfast fundraiser for one of its partners, an annual event that had been postponed because of Milton. It raised $25,000 for the Boy Scouts of America Withlacoochee District.

Wisconsin Examiner

This story was originally published on Wisconsin Examiner.

More than $130 million in Wisconsin clean energy-related projects are at risk as the Trump administration moves to cut up to $24 billion in projects originally approved by the Biden administration.

The projects are on a list that covers three groups of cuts proposed in May, on Oct. 2 and this past week. The online news outlet Semafor reported the third set of proposed cuts, which alone totals $12 billion, on Tuesday, Oct. 7, and published a link to a list that covers all three groups.

“However, it’s not clear whether, or when, the full list of cancellations will be enacted, or if President Donald Trump is instead looking to use them as leverage in negotiations over the [federal government] shutdown,” Semafor reported.

The Wisconsin grants on the list are a mix of projects that help boost energy efficiency, including supporting the expansion of energy storage battery systems. One potential casualty is more than $1 million to prepare young people to enter apprenticeships in the skilled trades.

Clean energy holds the promise of addressing air pollution and climate change as well as revitalizing the state’s industrial base, said John Imes, director of the Wisconsin Environmental Initiative (WEI), a nonprofit that advocates policies benefiting the environment and the economy.

“These are all win-win that all of us want regardless of our political affiliation,” Imes told the Wisconsin Examiner. “This is all bottom-line stuff.”

Rolling back projects that enhance cleaner and more efficient use of energy will likely increase the cost of energy, Imes said.

“It means higher electric bills, higher energy bills, fewer choices and lost jobs,” he said. “We’re going to lose momentum.”

Battery power and rural grid upgrade

The two largest Wisconsin projects on the Department of Energy list of targets involve one company, Alliant Energy. They account for more than half of the Wisconsin funds targeted for cancellation.

The projects are being undertaken by Alliant’s Wisconsin Power & Light unit. They include a $50 million grant for upgrading the rural electrical grid and $30 million for a power storage system using a technology based on carbon dioxide to be built near Portage, Wisconsin.

“We understand the Administration and Department of Energy (DOE) are working through their budgets and have notified some businesses of changes to grant announcements,” said Cindy Tomlinson, Alliant senior manager for communications, in an email message last week.

“At this time, we have not been made aware of any changes to the announced DOE grants for our Alliant Energy projects,” Tomlinson said. “We are optimistic the value and viability of these projects is clear and that they will remain fully funded. These projects deliver economic and customer benefits.”

The electrical grid upgrade project received a conditional commitment from the energy department in December, but a final award agreement hasn’t been executed, Tomlinson said, and no federal funds have been received or spent.

The federal grants accounted for about one-third of the total planned investment for each project. If the grid upgrade grant is canceled, the project is still expected to go forward, Tomlinson said, “however at a slower, more gradual pace than the fast, concentrated fashion outlined in our grant application.”

Other potentially affected grants include $28.7 million for Johnson Controls, based in the Milwaukee suburb of Glendale, to support the company in its expansion of heat pump manufacturing.

The grant’s total value was $33 million at the time it was awarded to the company. According to USAspending.gov, a federal site that tracks the status of federal outlays, the business has received $4.4 million of the total.

Johnson Controls announced the grant in November 2023, part of an investment to scale up heat pump manufacturing at plants in Texas, Kansas and Pennsylvania and increase production by 200%, the company said at the time.

The company did not respond to inquiries Thursday and Friday by email and by telephone about the status of the grant or its planned heat pump manufacturing expansion.

Energy efficiency and innovation

Another Wisconsin recipient with grants on the list that are slated for elimination is Slipstream, a Madison-based nonprofit that provides consulting services on energy efficiency and innovation.

“We’re trying to make our energy systems more efficient and better so everybody’s paying less for energy,” said Scott Hackel, Slipstream’s vice president for research.

Hackel said Slipstream is working with other organizations on the list of targeted projects, and some of those organizations have been notified of grant terminations.

Slipstream also has two direct grants on the list, but has not received any notification that those grants are being terminated, Hackel said.

Slipstream had been awarded $5.2 million for work on equipping buildings with technology that enables them to automatically manage their power demand — reducing the building’s electrical load when demand on the grid is high and amping up the load when broader demand eases.

The organization is in the middle of a project implementing demand management technology in a group of buildings. The information gained from that test could be used to develop incentive programs for building owners to adopt that kind of technology, Hackel said.

If that gets cut off before it’s finished, other buildings in Wisconsin “would not have this example to look to,” he said.

A second grant awarded to the organization, $4 million, is to be used to train inspectors, building designers and others in how to effectively comply with and make the best use of building codes, particularly energy codes.

“Everything we’re doing is trying to make buildings and homes more affordable to live in with lower utility bills,” Hackel said. “If we’re not able to do that, that’s also a cost to people in Wisconsin.”

Two Universities of Wisconsin grants, one for $10 million and the other for $2.9 million, are on the list. Both involve projects to test technology innovations, according to the federal grant information documents.

‘Electric city’ upgrades and a job-training program

A grant for the city of Kaukauna, Wisconsin, to install battery storage and make related electrical grid upgrades is also on the list. The original grant totaled $3 million, and so far $59,362 has been paid out, according to USAspending.gov, leaving $2.95 million that could be canceled.

The storage system is to bolster Kaukauna’s hydroelectric power generation operation, which dates to 1913 and led to the community’s adoption of “Electric City” as its nickname.

“Collateral damage from the Trump administration’s remarkably poor governance record continues to collect, this time in Kaukauna,” said Outagamie County Executive Tom Nelson. “I can’t think of something more insulting than making the electric grid of a place known as ‘Electric City’ less safe or efficient.”

Also on the list is the Wisconsin Regional Training Partnership, a Milwaukee nonprofit that provides training and certification to prepare people to enter apprenticeships in the skilled trades. WRTP was awarded a $1.5 million grant for training in skills related to transportation electrification. So far $112,470 has been paid out.

Dan Bukiewicz, head of the Milwaukee Building Trades Council and co-chair of the WRTP board of directors, said that the board hasn’t been notified that its grant might be at risk of being taken away by the Trump administration.

“I won’t say we’re surprised,” however, Bukiewicz said. “They’re just trying to roll back a lot of the green energy and infrastructure [investments]. … It’s trying to make time stand still, and it just won’t if the United States is going to compete globally.”

WRTP students typically come from underserved communities and are the most in need, Bukiewicz said. The program’s training emphasizes job safety, introduces students to the construction industry, equips them with basic skills that an apprenticeship will build on, and acquaints them with how the industry and the technology are changing and where they might find a place that suits them.

If the federal grant is pulled, “these dollars are irreplaceable,” Bukiewicz said. “It’s not just taking money away and eliminating classes. It’s eliminating opportunities and a chance for generational change for people who really need it.”",https://dailyreporter.com/files/2025/07/energy_dome_alliant_energy.jpg,N,,2025-10-13 16:02:45.782763

Though the industry is bracing for an EV sales slump, GM's leaders insist that investing deeply and early in a broad range of electric offerings was not a mistake.

Duncan Aldred may be the one automotive executive not sweating over the anticipated slowdown of the U.S. electric vehicle market.

Aldred, GM’s senior vice president and president of North America, is in a critical position: leading GM’s most profitable but challenging markets.

Electric vehicle sales in the U.S. trail other major car markets where the global company does business, which was not expected to be the case when GM first planned its broad EV portfolio. Last month, GM CEO Mary Barra said onstage at an industry event that “up until a year ago, we were on a journey to a regulatory environment where we had to drive EVs.”

Still, GM invested significant money and planning to offer the range of EVs it has today. Though the industry is bracing for an EV sales slump, GM's leaders insist that investing deeply and early in a broad range of electric offerings was not a mistake.

“We believe EVs will remain a strong part of the GM portfolio. Quite honestly, it’s one of the reasons why our market share has grown so much this year,” Aldred said. “It’s not something (we), in any way, shape or form, expect to give up.”

Year to date, GM estimates that its 17.2% market share across vehicle propulsion systems is the highest it's been in 10 years. So far this year, EV total sales more than doubled to 144,668 vehicles.

GM's public pledge to produce only electric vehicles by 2035 — put forth before President Donald Trump’s first administration amid a stricter regulatory environment for climate protections — has largely been scrapped.

Congress passed a bill ending the tax credit offered to electric car buyers of up to $7,500 on the purchase of qualifying new vehicles and $4,000 on qualifying used EVs on Sept. 30, years before its original expiration.

Ford and General Motors have since said they will extend some incentive programs through leases until year-end to transition away from government support, but GM backed outof that program after concerns were raised about it by U.S. Sen. Bernie Moreno, R-Ohio, a former car dealer who is active in auto policy. Ford also has backtracked.

In the 10 years since GM developed its strategy to develop a full portfolio of EVs, seismic issues repeatedly roiled the industry and put strain on the company’s capital.

Ford CEO Jim Farley said at a media event Sept. 30 that GM's dominance in the EV sales space is largely due to the range of vehicles GM offers.

“We've been No. 2 to Tesla for three years now. I think GM is passing us now, which is good for them, but I think we have three models, they have like 12 models,” Farley said. “So I would hope based on their investment that they would start to really accelerate that.”

A step forward, then a step back

Still, a smaller-than-predicted EV market has caused the company to make several expensive decisions to align operations with realistic vehicle sales. GM has made numerous production changes this year that reversed work that cost the company years and billions in investment converting plants to produce electric vehicles and left UAW workers in a state of confusion.

GM has slashed shifts and laid off hundreds of workers at its Factory Zero plant in Detroit-Hamtramck where it invested $2.2 billion to produce the GMC Hummer EV pickup and SUV; Chevrolet Silverado EV; GMC Sierra EV, and Cadillac Escalade IQ. Those workers will remain on layoff for the rest of the year, GM confirmed Oct. 9.

Late last month, GM changed the status of 900 workers on temporary layoff to “indefinite” layoff at the Fairfax Assembly plant in Kanas City, Kansas, while it retools the plant for production of the gas-powered Equinox.

Dontay Wilson, president of UAW Local 31, referred to the displacement of those workers as “not an ideal situation.”

“I understand the business is the business, but it would have been great to maintain some security for these folks for the foreseeable future,” he told the Detroit Free Press, part of the USA TODAY Network. “The GM Fairfax local management team has done a decent job, but from a top-down approach, it has been surprising at times. For us, we have been doing the best we can to roll with the punches.”

GM said in April that the Toledo (Ohio) Propulsions Systems plant, which produces transmissions for the Silverado and Sierra pickup trucks, would increase output as it reduces electric drive unit production.

But last month, as a local television station first reported, GM told workers that it would remove the equipment to even produce electric drive units at the site, the local union leader confirmed to the Detroit Free Press — equipment GM said it spent $760 million in 2022 to install.

Toledo Propulsion Systems was GM’s first U.S. powertrain or propulsion-related factory transformed for EV-related production.

About 1,520 GM employees work at the plant, according to the company’s website. Though no plant jobs were lost, just reallocated, the move still came as a blow, according to UAW Local 14 President Tony Totty.

“Just a couple of months ago, we had an EV ride and drive, and our members were excited,” Totty said in an Oct. 2 interview. “This is a punch to the gut. Our members were excited to make these things.”

Those electric drivetrains were destined for GM’s Orion Assembly Plant, for which GM received $480 million in grant funds from the state of Michigan to expand for electric vehicle production. On July 15, the company solidified plans to produce the Cadillac Escalade, the Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra light-duty pickups there.

For buyers, extra money dries up

GM’s strategy of crafting electrified options for its most popular models like the Chevrolet Blazer, Equinox and Silverado directly addressed what consumers wanted from the automaker’s emerging offerings, said Joseph Yoon, Edmunds' consumer insights analyst.

“Any flavor of EV that they want, you can get it at GM,” he said. “When you have that much choice in your lineup, it becomes easier to move customers into electric.”

No matter how desirable the product, hefty price tags and a lack of charging infrastructure present a challenge for dealers when pitching the vehicles to their customers.

The EV tax credit has been in place since 2008, so James Fackler, executive vice president of the Michigan Auto Dealers Association, said he understands why GM would want to continue the support consumers expect in showrooms.

“I can see the concern that these sales will dry up. People expect this money, and if it’s not there, will they continue to come?” he said. “There are many dealers that support the EV model. Like every salesperson, they want to give the customer what the customer wants, to check every box. A vehicle is a very expensive purchase, even used.”

What the future holds

When GM promised the delivery of an all-electric vehicle portfolio, it envisioned a market capable of supporting those sales. Since that has not come to pass, the company is looking to protect the sale of vehicles that it knows will be profitable — internal combustion vehicles.

So GM has supported the Trump administration's efforts to defang clean air regulation. One example is when GM applauded the Trump administration when it signed a congressional resolution in June reversing a waiver California and other states had been granted that would let them ban the sale of gas-powered vehicles.

GM and other automakers have long argued that California and the other states should not have been allowed to do that, effectively getting to decide what kind of cars and trucks they have to make for the whole country.

The White House shared what General Motors said after reversing the waiver: ""We appreciate the actions taken by President Trump to sign (the resolution) into law and help align emissions standards with today’s market realities. We have long advocated for one national standard that will allow us to stay competitive, continue to invest in U.S. innovation, and offer customer choice across the broadest lineup of gas-powered and electric vehicles.”

Charlie Chesbrough, senior economist and senior director of Industry Insights at Cox Automotive, also noted the industry welcomed Trump’s interventions in the industry surrounding clean air.

“In terms of the vehicle market, this may be a blessing in disguise for automakers by having fewer sticks swung at them in terms of EV mandates — they will be freed up in the longer term to produce the vehicles people want and can afford,” Chesbrough said.

“Everybody is in shock right now trying to figure out what is the best strategy going forward,” he said. “The bigger danger for the Detroit Three is they’re no longer global manufacturers, they’ve been chased back to North America and China seems to be ... quickly moving people onto their (battery electric vehicles). Will we be able to make a competitive electric product, or will this be something we have ceded to the Chinese market?”

'No need' for discounting

With GM facing increased tariff costs and stripped of government tax incentives, Aldred’s goal to maintain EV sales momentum without excessive discounting is ambitious.

Despite those challenges, Aldred said he plans to hold firm to GM’s playbook that allowed the company to gain market share even when the competition accelerated incentives, or discounts. Earlier this year, several automakers adjusted pricing strategies ahead of Trump's first round of tariffs on foreign-made vehicles and parts. GM was the only Detroit-based automaker that did not run any ads about its U.S. commitment or lowering costs.

Also GM on Oct. 9 showed off its newest EV, a new Chevrolet Bolt, the automaker's most affordable electric vehicle, and said it plans to begin shipping them to dealerships in January. But the Detroit automaker said the vehicle would sell for only a “limited run” and would not clarify to reporters what that meant.

Paul Waatti, director of industry analysis for AutoPacific, said bringing back the Bolt corrected one of Mary Barra's rare missteps ― retiring the most attainable long-range EV just as affordability became the biggest barrier to selling electric cars.

“There's still a chicken-and-egg dilemma: Affordable EVs need volume to survive, but volume won't come without affordable EVs,” Waatti said. “GM, perhaps more than any other automaker, is uniquely positioned to tackle that tension with its strong ICE portfolio that gives it the flexibility to support EV accessibility ― even if that means at a loss ― while its long-term EV strategy takes shape.”

Though GM will remain “competitive” with its incentives moving forward, the company’s plan, Aldred said, is to more or less let the vehicles speak for themselves.

One method? Maintaining low inventory levels of desirable products to bolster dealership profitability, which in turn ensures the automaker doesn't require high incentives to sell cars.

“We won't be changing that formula. Going into next year, we started off looking at the industry ... what might happen, what will the other brands do, what will the incentive landscape be?” Aldred said. “In the end, we kind of said, 'Well, let's just look at ourselves.' Because really, what the adoption is and what other people do is somewhat irrelevant. We've got an outstanding portfolio of EVs as well as (internal combustion engine vehicles), and we believe we can sell a volume of those irrespective of what's going to happen in the bigger marketplace.”

Louisville’s industrial market stands out as a steady force, resisting the fluctuations often seen in surrounding Midwest cities such as Cincinnati, Columbus and St. Louis. Midyear figures show Louisville’s year-over-year rent growth exceeding the national percentage and its vacancy rate 340 basis points below the national rate, both signs of a healthy market.

Additionally, Louisville’s recognition in national trade publications and recent announcements of General Electric/Haier and Ford’s electric vehicle (EV) investment at its Louisville Assembly Plant suggests positive future job growth.

A sturdy foundation

Louisville’s centralized location has helped secure its place as a major logistical powerhouse and develop relationships with major industrial business players such as UPS, Ford and General Electric. UPS announced its first expansion into Louisville in 1981 and has continued to grow its operations since, including the recently opened $100 million automated medical labs shipping facility.

Ford also continues to invest in Louisville, recently leasing a 567,433-square-foot facility in Southern Indiana and a 426,300-square-foot facility in Louisville’s Bullitt County submarket just south of Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport. Additionally, General Electric/Haier will move washer/dryer manufacturing processes to Louisville, creating 800 new jobs and confirming Haier’s Louisville manufacturing operations as its global hub.

A resilient market

High material costs, labor shortages, rising insurance premiums, tariffs and elevated interest rates have been topics of concern over the past several years, hindering new development as well as burdening current occupiers. While Louisville hasn’t been immune to these challenges, the economic impact has been muted compared to surrounding cities.

As of the second quarter, Louisville stands at a 3.7 percent vacancy rate, beating out the national industrial vacancy rate at 7.1 percent, as well as Cincinnati (5.8 percent), Columbus (8.2 percent), Indianapolis (10.4 percent) and Nashville (4.5 percent). Asking rent growth at the end of 2024 landed at 4.6 percent year-over-year, 200 basis points higher than the U.S. growth rate of 2.6 percent.

Year-end leasing activity and absorption figures of Louisville and five Midwest cities (Cincinnati, Columbus, Indianapolis, Nashville, and St. Louis) from 2020 to 2024 show a range of volatility, with each city at some point outperforming the others. Averages of leasing activity and absorption figures in that five-year time period, however, show that Louisville performs competitively to its bigger Midwest counterparts, with the market outperforming all but Indianapolis in absorption and leasing activity.

While the industrial real estate market faces economic headwinds, Louisville continues to showcase steady and healthy market activity that reflects continued market interest with tenant demand competing with limited speculative availability.

Inventory growth

Markets that boast about having high inventory growth numbers usually have to face the downside of large negative absorption numbers and high vacancies during dips in the economy. Louisville’s slow but deliberate inventory growth has created a buffer to the current nationwide trends of elevated vacancy rates, conservative tenant demand and slowing new construction. Limited speculative availability and shovel-ready land have kept vacancy rates low and asking rates competitive.

So far, construction completions for 2025 stand at 1 million square feet of new supply, a slower first half than anticipated. The construction pipeline at the end of the second quarter, however, tallied at 6.4 million square feet of total bulk (buildings 100,000 square feet and over) under construction. Since the end of the quarter, an additional 1.6 million square feet has started construction, totaling 8.1 million square feet of product under construction.

With an equally healthy number of planned buildings in the pipeline, the future supply for Louisville appears healthy and measured. Currently, we are still expecting new bulk deliveries to be twice the amount in 2025 compared to 2024, which will contribute to a temporary rise in the vacancy rate.

What’s next?

More and more investors and developers seem to be taking notice of Louisville’s industrial market, appreciating its stability and resistance to national economic factors. In 2025, Louisville has been named No. 9 in America’s Top States for Business (best cost of doing business) by CNBC, is No. 6 (nationally) in U.S. Metro for Economic Business by SiteSelection, and, according to NewKentuckyHomes.com, is No. 1 in vehicle production, air cargo by weight, EV battery production and bourbon exports.

Additionally, healthy leasing activity and absorption combined with a low vacancy rate and vigorous building activity suggest positive future growth.

While continued uncertainty and high construction costs may limit speculative construction, elsewhere, Louisville’s affordability, state and local incentives and convenient accessibility to over half of the U.S population in a day’s drive make the area appealing to developers and occupiers alike, ensuring a healthy future.

It may be the best part of 2,500 years since the Athenian playwright wrote those words, but as human society embarks on arguably the most challenging and consequential economic transition in history - the green industrial revolution - they are as pertinent as ever.

The route to future prosperity is increasingly obvious. McKinsey has estimated the global market opportunity presented by the net zero transition could be worth more than £1tr for UK companies by 2030. By the same date, the Climate Change Committee (CCC), has estimated the pursuit of net zero could deliver a net increase in jobs of up to 725,000 across the UK economy. And, within 20 years, it projects the path to net zero could drive down average household energy and motoring costs by up to £1,400 a year. All that, before you consider how a net zero economy should help safeguard the only habitable planet in the known universe from ecosystem collapse, and in doing dampen the risk of the spiralling inflation, infrastructure damage, and healthcare costs that would come with runaway climate change.

There may still be politicians who seek to argue otherwise, framing climate change as a ""con"" and net zero as a costly endeavour that risks destroying industry and forcing businesses and jobs abroad. Just last week Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch claimed, without evidence, that the UK's net zero targets were ""destroying more jobs than they are creating"" as she called for the Climate Change Act and net zero targets to be scrapped.

But such claims rarely survive contact with reality. The CBI estimates that, already today, there are around 22,000 net zero businesses - spanning range of sectors from renewable energy to green finance - employing some one million people in the UK. These companies and the jobs they provide are rapidly growing, too: last year these industries grew 10 per cent - three times faster than the rest of the economy - while generating £83bn in gross value added (GVA). Moreover, they offer better paid jobs with annual average salaries £5,600 above the average UK wage, at £43,000 a year.

Make no mistake, the signals of green prosperity are already emerging in the UK. Yet as Sophocles reminds us, none of the opportunities on offer can be grasped without painstaking work - and, crucially, a workforce with the right skills and talent to deliver the infrastructure and reforms that are so urgently needed.

And there's the rub. It is well documented that the path towards a cleaner, greener, resilient, and more prosperous future presents huge engineering, financial, and policy challenges. But the net zero transition is as much a skills challenge as anything else. And it is this very human question of how to develop the skills and build the workforce required to build a net zero economy that is at risk of being dangerously overlooked.

Indeed, as the UK charts its course towards a cleaner, more prosperous future, much of the current and projected workforce is ill prepared for the journey. There are skills shortages emerging across multiple green sectors, and the pipeline of school leavers or people switching careers, including those from carbon intensive industries, is struggling to fill the gaps.

Recent research by Green Alliance has warned the UK faces a widening green skills gap across every major sector of the economy, highlighting housing, transport, and land-use as facing the most immediate shortages. The UK is crying out for more heat pump engineers, sustainable packaging designers, and carbon accountants, yet these are still seen as relatively niche skills, rather than the bread and butter of tomorrow's economy that they are soon to become.

Meanwhile, a recent study by recruitment website Indeed found more than a quarter of UK firms are facing challenges when it comes to recruiting for sustainability-related jobs, while almost half of jobseekers admit they lack the necessary qualifications or experience for working in the green economy. The situation is even more stark for young people, with recent LinkedIn data showing just one in 20 people in the 18-24 age bracket believe they have the green skills needed to enter jobs supporting the net zero transition. In the clean energy sector alone, PwC estimated that the UK may soon face a green skills gap of 200,000 jobs.

For its part, the government is preparing to launch a new Clean Energy Jobs plan to support its recently announced push to double the number of roles in the sector to 830,000 by 2030. But delivering on that target will require a huge increase in the UK's science, technology, maths, and engineering (STEM) skills base, especially given the challenges of an ageing existing workforce and the way many other industries and countries are clamouring for the same skills required by clean energy developers.

Clearly, if the UK's net zero transition comes unstuck, it will not be for a lack of job opportunities - rather, it will be the lack of trained people to do them. And this is where the bad-faith arguments of net zero sceptics risk finding leverage: because it is all very well and good creating industries capable of supporting hundreds of thousands if not millions of new job opportunities in the burgeoning net zero economy, if British workers do not have the skills or experience to fill those roles, or the support and confidence to change career.

Get it wrong, and young people seeking rewarding career opportunities and communities reliant on declining high carbon industries will once again suffer. It is easy to see how under such a scenario it would be easier to blame clean technologies and a net zero transition that failed to deliver on their promise than the failure to deliver the training opportunities that would make new green jobs a possibility. Net zero naysayers' doom-laden prophecies of de-industrialisation and jobs being exported abroad risk being proved at last partially accurate, creating the conditions for an even more intense political backlash against climate action.

To head off this risk it is vital the net zero transition delivers the jobs it has promised - and that those jobs are well paid and rewarding. Diversity and equality of opportunity matters, too, because as Climate Change Committee CEO Emma Pinchbeck argued last week, DEI isn't just ""tokenistic"" but intrinsic to designing and delivering a future that works for - and gets the most out of - everyone. ""If you want to build a future, you need everyone in the room to design that future,"" she said.

None of this will be easy. The competition for green skills is intensifying at breakneck speed. Almost every major economy in the world is now jostling for a leading role in burgeoning clean technology race, with China already streets ahead. The workers with the ability to manufacture and install heat pumps or build genuinely sustainable business models will be in hot demand.

Meanwhile, this demand will have to be met against the backdrop of the UK's ageing population, tightening restrictions on immigration, perennial challenges in developing the STEM skills base, a university funding crisis, and a fractious political battle over the UK's net zero targets. The changing labour market will also have to navigate the political, economic, and social fallout from the inevitable contraction of carbon intensive industries and the need to re-train workers to support the roll out of new clean technologies.

However, where there is challenge, there is also opportunity. The good news is every new job supported by the burgeoning green economy creates another strong advocate in their community for the transition ahead, and real world evidence of how these jobs can be hugely rewarding. There is a reason why, even despite the climate-denial and 'war' on clean energy touted by the Party's leaders Nigel Farage and Richard Tice, even some Reform UK-led councils are standing up for clean energy policies and industries: political decisions that destroy employment do not tend to be hugely popular with voters.

Every green job should be seen as a blow to scepticism and kamikaze 'business as usual' economics that are sure to feature heavily in the run up to the next election, which is now almost certain to be a de-facto referendum on net zero.

There is also a growing understanding of how to build out the green skills base, of the skills that are needed, the training and recruitment strategies that work, and the messaging that can attract more people to what is a hugely exciting and vibrant sector.

All of which is why BusinessGreen is today launching Workforce 2030, a brand-new campaign that aims to raise awareness of the looming skills crunch facing industries right across the green economy, and help advance solutions to ensure the promised employment opportunities and benefits are both capitalised on and widely shared.

Through dedicated news, analysis, case studies, and input from an array of expert voices, the campaign aims to bang the drum for ambitious policies, funding, training, and education at local, national, and corporate levels to equip the workforce of both today and tomorrow with the critical skills needed to further advance the green industrial revolution.

We therefore invite businesses, politicians, academics, think tanks, and all those working in the green economy or interested in doing so to join us in promoting the campaign and the workforce that will be needed for 2030 - because without labour, nothing prospers.

(AP) — Thirty years ago, Willie Cruz was shocked when he learned the Southern California oil refinery where he worked was shutting down.
The Phillips 66 refinery will start shutting down this month and end active fuel production at the end of 2025, the company said.
The closure is based on multiple factors and “in response to market dynamics,"" Phillips 66 said.
After more than a decade, he makes a base salary of $118,000 a year as a pipe fitter at the Phillips 66 refinery.
“There’s not really a real clear plan to be able to get workers from this oil industry into these new fields,” he said.","SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — Thirty years ago, Willie Cruz was shocked when he learned the Southern California oil refinery where he worked was shutting down.

Cruz, now a 61-year-old living in Arizona, had spent five years working in the environmental department when Powerine Oil Company said it would close the plant in Santa Fe Springs, southeast of Los Angeles.

Cruz feared getting laid off again if he stayed in the industry. He decided to look into respiratory therapy, in part because he’s asthmatic. A federal job training program paid for his schooling.

“I thought it was pretty cool, you know — go from polluting to helping, right?” Cruz said.

Now he's advising his son, Wilfredo Cruz, as the Phillips 66 refinery in Los Angeles where the 37-year-old has worked for 12 years plans to close by the end of the month.

Thousands — perhaps tens of thousands — of workers could lose jobs in the coming years as California tries to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels. Energy company Valero said earlier this year it would close a refinery in the Bay Area.

California's leading Democrats are grappling with how to confront lost jobs and high gas prices that the oil industry says are the result of the state's climate policies.

State energy regulators are negotiating to keep the Valero plant open and recently backed off a proposal to penalize oil companies for high profits, while Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom signed legislation to speed oil well permitting in the Central Valley. That action came after years of Newsom declaring he was “taking on big oil.”

That inconsistent messaging has left the industry's workers unsure of what the future holds.

Refinery closures

California was the eighth-largest crude oil producer in the nation in 2024, down from being the third-largest in 2014, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The Valero and Phillips 66 refineries set to close account for roughly 18% of California’s refining capacity, according to state energy regulators. They both produce jet fuel, gas and diesel.

The Phillips 66 refinery will start shutting down this month and end active fuel production at the end of 2025, the company said. The closure is based on multiple factors and “in response to market dynamics,"" Phillips 66 said.

The announcement came after Newsom signed a law last year aimed at preventing gas price spikes that allows energy regulators to require that refineries keep a certain amount of fuel on hand to avoid shortages when they go offline for maintenance. But the company said its decision was unrelated to the law.

Phillips 66 said it is “committed to treating all our refinery workers fairly and respectfully throughout this process.”

Valero announced plans to “idle, restructure or cease refining operations” at its refinery in the Bay Area city of Benicia by the end of April. The company didn’t respond to emails seeking comment on the status of its plans.

Valero pays about $7.7 million annually in taxes to the city, making up around 13% of Benicia’s revenues, City Manager Mario Giuliani said.

“It’s a significant and seismic impact to the city,” he said of the planned closure.

Forty-six oil refineries in California closed between 2018 and 2024, according to the state’s Employment Development Department. The fossil fuel industry employs roughly 94,000 people in the state, according to the Public Policy Institute of California.

One study estimated that the state would lose nearly 58,000 workers in the oil and gas industries between 2021 and 2030. About 56% of those workers will have to find new jobs because they are not retiring, according to the 2021 report by the Political Economy Research Institute at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.

Supporting displaced workers

Lawmakers approved the Displaced Oil and Gas Worker Fund in 2022 to help workers receive career training and connect with job opportunities. The state has since awarded nearly $30 million overall to several groups to help workers across the state — from oil-rich Kern County to Contra Costa County in the Bay Area.

But the funding is set to run out in 2027, and state lawmakers wrapped up their work for the year without an agreement on whether to extend it.

Newsom spokesperson Daniel Villaseñor said the governor is committed to supporting displaced oil workers “and affected communities in transitioning into new and emerging jobs and economic opportunities.”

Newsom approved $20 million in the state’s 2022-2023 budget for a pilot program to train workers in the industry who've lost their jobs to plug abandoned oil wells in Kern and Los Angeles counties.

California needs a clear plan for workers who will lose jobs because of the state’s energy transition, said Faraz Rizvi, the policy and campaign manager at the Asian Pacific Environmental Network.

“We’re in solidarity with workers who have been displaced and who are looking for a relief to ensure that they’re able to find work that is important for their communities,” Rizvi said.

But Jodie Muller, president and CEO of the Western States Petroleum Association, said the state can protect jobs by changing its climate policies.

“The extremists fighting to close California refineries should explain why they are OK with destroying some of the best blue-collar jobs out there — because we certainly are not,” she said in a statement.

Life as an oil worker

For many workers, the industry offers an opportunity to earn a living wage without a college degree.

Wilfredo Cruz was attracted in part by the paycheck. After more than a decade, he makes a base salary of $118,000 a year as a pipe fitter at the Phillips 66 refinery.

But there are downsides.

Every day when Cruz gets home from work, he showers immediately to try to shield his son from exposure to any harmful chemicals. He also never lets the 2-year-old ride in the car he takes to work.

Now he's enrolled in an online cybersecurity training course, schooling paid for by the state program that's set to expire in the next couple of years.

“There’s not really a real clear plan to be able to get workers from this oil industry into these new fields,” he said. “So, you feel kind of forgotten.”",https://img.designdevelopmenttoday.com/mindful/im/workspaces/default/uploads/2025/10/ap25283205200805.fQlPfEfZ7p.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&crop=focalpoint&fit=max&fp-x=0.52&fp-y=0.13&q=70&w=1200,N,,2025-10-13 11:01:55.671629

The utility had aimed to retire all of its remaining coal plants by 2035.
The plants slated for extension include the 2.24GW Belews Creek facility in Stokes County, North Carolina, which could continue operations until 2040.
Alongside delayed coal retirements, Duke intends to expand its natural gas fleet, requiring more than 100 miles of new pipeline infrastructure across North Carolina.

Much of the increased power requirement stems from new data center and AI infrastructure, according to Duke. “Regulators have made clear that replacement generation must be online and serving customers before additional coal units can retire,” company spokesman Bill Norton said.

In the plan, Duke said that due to “increasing challenges” in maintaining grid stability, the plants would have to be extended. The utility had aimed to retire all of its remaining coal plants by 2035. The plants slated for extension include the 2.24GW Belews Creek facility in Stokes County, North Carolina, which could continue operations until 2040.

Following this, the utility has said it intends to deploy small modular nuclear reactors (SMR) at former coal sites, targeting deployment by 2037.

Alongside delayed coal retirements, Duke intends to expand its natural gas fleet, requiring more than 100 miles of new pipeline infrastructure across North Carolina. While thermal generation has received a boost, the utility also reported its intention to scale back renewable targets, with projected solar additions dropping from 8.2GW by 2031 to 7.9GW by 2033, while onshore and offshore wind, which was previously forecast to add 3.6GW within ten years, has now been excluded until at least 2040.

The updated roadmap closely follows notable changes in state and federal energy policy. Last month, the US Department of Energy indicated that it was prepared to utilize emergency powers to extend the lifespan of coal-fired power plants.

The statements are a continuation of a pro-coal policy first announced by President Trump in April, when he signed a series of executive orders to “reinvigorate” the country’s coal sector to meet the surging energy demand of AI data centers.

The orders included edicts to “remove federal regulatory barriers that undermine coal production, encouraging the utilization of coal to meet growing domestic energy demands, increasing American coal exports, and ensuring that Federal policy does not discriminate against coal production or coal-fired electricity generation.”

Several utilities have already extended the life of coal-fired plants this year, citing data center demand as a major driver. A recent example is Southern Company, which in February announced its intention to extend the life of three plants with a combined capacity of 8.2GW from 2028 to 2035.

Duke Energy is based in Charlotte, North Carolina, and owns 54.8GW of baseload and peak generation in the US. It serves 8.4 million customers across six US states, including Ohio, Kentucky, Indiana, North and, South Carolina, and Florida. It also has subsidiaries in Puerto Rico and Argentina.",https://media.datacenterdynamics.com/media/images/coal_7mpEgrr.2e16d0ba.fill-1200x630.png,N,,2025-10-13 11:02:27.783057

NEW YORK (Reuters) -JPMorgan Chase launched a $1.5 trillion plan on Monday to facilitate, finance and invest in industries deemed critical to the U.S. national security and economic resilience, including defense, energy and advanced manufacturing.

As part of the 10-year initiative, the largest U.S. lender also plans to hire more bankers and invest up to $10 billion into U.S. companies through direct equity and venture capital investments, focusing on fast-growing businesses and key manufacturers.

The announcement comes as U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration looks to modernize infrastructure and reduce dependence on foreign supply chains, particularly in sectors like pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, clean energy and rare earths.

“It has become painfully clear that the United States has allowed itself to become too reliant on unreliable sources of critical minerals, products and manufacturing – all of which are essential for our national security,” JPMorgan Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon said.

Trump revived the trade war against Beijing on Friday, ending an uneasy truce between the two largest economies with promises to sharply hike tariffs in a reprisal against China curbing its rare earths exports.

JPMorgan said its new “security and resiliency initiative” would facilitate financing and investment across four strategic sectors: supply chain and manufacturing; defense and aerospace; energy independence; and frontier technologies such as artificial intelligence and quantum computing.

The firm said it had already planned to facilitate and finance about $1 trillion over the next decade in support of clients in these important industries, according to previously undisclosed internal figures, but it would be increasing the size by 50%.

The U.S. government is pursuing deals across up to 30 industries, involving dozens of companies deemed critical to national or economic security, Reuters reported this month.

JPMorgan, which helped put together the government’s deal with U.S. rare earths mining company MP Materials, said in a recent company podcast that the bank was working with the Trump administration to explore more such opportunities.

“We’ve had no less than 100 calls with clients to talk about the MP transaction as well as what this means for other industries,” said Andrew Castaldo, JPMorgan’s co-head of mid-cap mergers and acquisitions. “And we’ve had numerous trips down to Washington to explore those opportunities with the government.”

Dimon also emphasized the need for policy reform to accelerate progress, citing regulatory delays and workforce challenges.

“America needs more speed and investment,” he said.

KEY INVESTMENT AREAS

The four key investment areas identified by the firm have been divided into 27 sub-sectors ranging from shipbuilding and nuclear energy to nanomaterials and secure communications and will include middle-market companies as well as large corporate clients, it added.

The bank said it would establish an external advisory council composed of public and private sector leaders, in addition to hiring more bankers and investment professionals.

It will also expand thematic research on supply chain vulnerabilities and emerging technologies, leveraging its recently launched Center for Geopolitics.

AI and energy security are key tailwinds for cleaner power

Multi-speed transition is playing out, but the long-term trend is unchanged to deploy $150trn in green technologies

The global megatrends of electrification and energy security are persuading investors in the green transition to look past short-term headwinds when allocating capital, according to senior executives at Nomura Greentech’s Sustainable Leaders Summit in Salzburg, Austria.

About $150 trillion of capital is required by 2050 to fund the global energy transition and despite recent inflationary challenges and slower progress from countries such as the US, there is a great deal of optimism about investing into green technologies.

While the cost of capital for renewables has reset at a higher level amid inflationary forces – a 200bps rise since 2021 with most of that increase coming since the third quarter of 2022 – executives viewed this as a sign that speculative capital is making way for long-term investors who see the inevitability of transitioning to sustainable energy systems.

There are reasons for optimism in all major markets including Europe, China and the US.

EUROPE – ENERGY INDEPENDENCE

Europe is committed to eliminating its dependence on Russian gas via its REPowerEU plan, which is accelerating the region’s decarbonization ambitions. Imports of Russian gas dropped from 150 billion cubic meters (bcm) in 2021 to 52 bcm in 2024 – with the overall share of Russian gas imports falling from 45% to 19%, according to the European Commission. This intensifying focus on energy security means that the bloc continues to roll out renewable energy more quickly, with almost half (47%) of electricity in the EU now coming from renewables. Installed wind and solar capacity has increased by 58% cumulatively between 2021 and 2024.

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has also caused wider tremors among neighbouring countries, prompting them to prioritise defence spending in order to become more self-reliant in the event of a wider conflict. Germany has announced plans to nearly double its defence budget to €650 billion ($764 billion) over the next five years. Companies such as Fernride have spotted a trillion-dollar opportunity to create regional champions in the sphere of automated armoured vehicles in combat zones, at ports and for freight logistics on public roads. Fernride’s AI-based human-in-the-loop technology means that one driver can operate up to 50 trucks remotely to address massive shortages of commercial drivers (400k) and trained soldiers (300k).

Europe has also made considerable progress on installing electric vehicle (EV) chargers. Take Germany, - the bloc’s biggest country - where more than 145k public charge points have been installed and a forecasted slowdown in EV car sales has not materialised.

EUROPE – REGULATORY LEADER

Europe has also used its strength in regulation to encourage the adoption of green technologies across multiple sectors as illustrated by ReFuel EU, which aims to boost the supply and demand of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) by increasing SAF and eSAF mandates over time. SAF is derived from hydrotreated esters and acids while eSAF is a synthetic fuel drives from renewable energy such as solar, hydro or wind.

The FuelEU Maritime Mandate is another example of EU regulation taking a leadership role to drive change. The rules set increasingly strict limits on the greenhouse gas intensity of fuels, aiming for an 80% reduction by 2050 for commercial vessels over 5,000 gross tonnage calling at EU ports. The International Maritime Organization created its own net zero framework earlier this year encompassing a new fuel standard for ships and a global pricing mechanism for emissions.

In stark contrast to these sectors and to emphasise the powerful impact of effective regulation, summit participants cited the petrochemicals industry where regulatory drivers and subsidies are in short supply. Entrenched interests are high, and an oversupply of conventional petrochemicals is keeping prices low, meaning alternatives that carry a green premium struggle to compete with incumbents selling cheaper, higher-emission products.

CHINA – A LOW CARBON INDUSTRIAL CHAMPION

China’s decades-long investment into photovoltaic (PV) technology has paved the way for more affordable solar power across the globe. China’s share in all the manufacturing stages of solar panels (such as polysilicon, ingots, wafers, cells and modules) exceeds 80%, more than double China’s share of global PV demand, according to the International Energy Agency.

As a result, the levelized cost of PV solar power – which includes the cost of building the plant – has declined by 88% over the past 15 years; removing green premiums has been key to mass adoption.

In addition, China’s rapid rollout of battery technology for EVs has accelerated adoption at home and abroad.

The chart below shows that more than half of China’s vehicles will be electric by 2030.

US – MARKET FORCES DRIVE CAPACITY UPGRADES

While the US renewables market is contending with political headwinds arising from President Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) and tariffs on imports of PV panels, aging grid infrastructure and greater power demand from investments in AI data centers could offset these negative effects.

The OBBBA reduces Inflation Reduction Act tax credits for wind and solar but preserves full credits for energy storage and clean firm technologies through 2033. Tariff escalations and geopolitical tensions have intensified supply chain challenges, but as a result, a renewed focus on domestic manufacturing and alternative sourcing has emerged, even across hard to decouple supply chains such as critical components for batteries and PV modules.

High growth in the US power market is projected over the next 15 years as demand continues to outpace supply due to significant growth in sectors requiring near-term power. Over the last two decades, improved energy efficiency for lighting, appliances and heating and cooling meant that the compound annual growth rate for energy demand was about 0.4% per year but the new era of AI, EV penetration and electrification of everything is set to substantially increase demand to 3.5% per year until 2040, according to McKinsey data.

Historically, energy has not been a constraint on computing; even as higher internet traffic increased data center workloads by nine times between 2010-2020, overall energy use stayed flat because of more and more efficient chips. But the AI era is set to turn that paradigm on its head, leading to a 17-64GW shortfall in peak power demand by 2030, which will likely require fast-built solar and battery storage to fill the gap.

Every US region is in need of energy infrastructure upgrades and replacements to minimize impacts of congestion and increase reliability. All three major components of the electric grid - generation, transmission and distribution - have an identified investment gap, which is projected to grow to a cumulative $197 billion by 2029, highlighting significant vulnerabilities in existing energy infrastructure. The US utility industry expects to see about a ~1.6x increase in capital expenditures into critical infrastructure over the period of 2026-2030 representing $1.3 trillion in capex from 2026-2030.

In short, executives increasingly see a-multi-speed transition playing out with China using its industrial scale to take the lead on renewables and EVs while Europe uses the stick of regulation and energy independence to advance the green transition. The US faces short term challenges, yet it has already laid strong foundations to build resilient systems for an electrified, digital future.

“For too long, federal governments of both political colours have avoided pricing carbon because they fear higher electricity prices,” Reeve said.
“Our report shows that the source of that fear is becoming outdated.” The Coalition introduced the safeguard mechanism and Labor revamped it in 2023.
Government data suggests the total direct pollution from facilities covered by the safeguard mechanism fell by nearly 2% in the first year after Labor’s revamp.
He said it was “looking at a range of post-2030 settings” but had no plans to include electricity in the safeguard mechanism.","Australian household energy bills will halve by 2050 as solar panels, batteries and electric cars and appliances become the norm, reducing pressure on the federal government over living costs and creating room for more climate action, a thinktank study suggests.

Modelling by the Grattan Institute finds that cutting greenhouse gas emissions from electricity generation in line with the goal of reaching net zero emissions by 2050 will cut average household energy costs from about $5,800 today to about $3,000.

The report says a fall of roughly this magnitude will happen under existing policies as households use less gas and petrol and more clean energy. The biggest savings are expected in gas-reliant Victoria, where the modelling suggests average annual spending on petrol, gas and electricity could fall from $6,036 to $2,767.

The report says emission cuts in the power sector are not happening fast enough and the mid-century net zero target will not be met without a policy requiring cuts in pollution from electricity.

The Grattan Institute has called on the government to consider expanding a policy applied to major industrial polluting sites – the safeguard mechanism – to include power plants. It says this would limit household energy savings compared with what would otherwise happen, but only marginally – by about 3%.

It says the safeguard mechanism is already a form of carbon pricing – language the Labor government has avoided since it lost a fraught political fight that culminated with the Coalition government under Tony Abbott abolishing a functioning carbon pricing scheme in 2014. The institute’s energy and climate change program director, Alison Reeve, said how people use energy has changed since then “and the politics of carbon pricing should change too”.

“For too long, federal governments of both political colours have avoided pricing carbon because they fear higher electricity prices,” Reeve said. “Our report shows that the source of that fear is becoming outdated.”

The Coalition introduced the safeguard mechanism and Labor revamped it in 2023. It requires about 200 industrial facilities that release more than 100,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide in Australia each year – including liquified natural gas plants, coalmines, smelters and factories – to reduce emission intensity by 4.9% each year until 2030.

The cuts can be made either on site or by buying carbon offsets. Companies that reduce emissions below a baseline level are also given “safeguard mechanism credits” that they can sell to polluters that do not meet their baseline.

Government data suggests the total direct pollution from facilities covered by the safeguard mechanism fell by nearly 2% in the first year after Labor’s revamp. But the scheme has been criticised for allowing unlimited use of offsets despite peer-reviewed studies suggesting they are failing to deliver what was promised.

A review of the safeguard mechanism is planned next year.

Reeve said the institute’s modelling assumed electricity companies would make direct emission cuts, and could not rely Australian carbon credits created through methods including improved nature cover.

She said a “pure” carbon tax or emissions trading scheme would be better than current policies, including the safeguard mechanism – a point also made by the longtime Labor climate and economics adviser Ross Garnaut – but Grattan had focused on what was politically achievable.

“Neither of those horses are in the race at the moment,” she said. “You can only bet on the horses that are in the race.”

Labor has faced criticism for delays in the rollout of solar and windfarms needed to meet its target of 82% of electricity coming from renewable sources by 2030.

Renewable energy in homes has boomed since the introduction of a battery subsidy in July. But investment in large-scale developments – particularly windfarms – has slowed, in part due to delays in planning approvals, construction of transmission links and supply chains.

The federal climate change and energy minister, Chris Bowen, said the government was focused on delivering existing policies, including an underwriting program for large solar, wind and battery developments (known as the capacity investment scheme), the $20bn “rewiring the nation” program and the battery subsidy. He said it was “looking at a range of post-2030 settings” but had no plans to include electricity in the safeguard mechanism.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b8f28f6c98b3b9e387536c678228873ddc263ea5/1582_0_4418_3534/master/4418.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=eeb04b20ccc4fd41e56d2cbccd22c3d4",N,,2025-10-13 09:58:21.310306

The Earth has passed its first climate tipping point

A new Global Tipping Points report led by the University of Exeter warns the Earth has crossed its first catastrophic climate threshold: the irreversible decline of warm-water coral reefs. These reefs, which support a quarter of marine species and sustain the lives of hundreds of millions of people, are officially undergoing “widespread dieback” due to ocean warming. The scientists estimate reefs begin collapsing between 1°C and 1.5°C of global heating, with current warming already at 1.4°C. The report, backed by 160 scientists from 23 countries, also cautions that other critical systems, the Amazon, Antarctic ice, and ocean currents, may soon reach tipping points. The urgency for sustainable business practices and emissions cuts continues to grow as scientists discover these irreversible tipping points.

Pentagon commits $1B towards critical minerals stockpile to counter China

The U.S. Department of Defense is ramping up efforts to secure supplies of critical minerals essential for weapons, clean energy, and tech manufacturing. Through its Defense Logistics Agency, the Pentagon plans to buy up to $1 billion worth of cobalt, antimony, tantalum, scandium, and other key materials, many of which are dominated by Chinese supply chains. The ambitious plans follow Beijing’s export controls on rare earths and related technologies announced last week. The U.S. relies on critical minerals for defense, and Trump is eager to use $5B for defense department investments in critical minerals supply chains. With these bold investments, the critical question that remains is: where will these minerals come from?

New Zealand targets 24% methane cut from livestock by 2050

New Zealand has announced a strategy to reduce methane emissions from livestock, the sector responsible for nearly half its total greenhouse gases, by up to 24% by 2050. The plan emphasizes research, technology investment, and collaboration with farmers to develop low-emission feed and breeding innovations. Agriculture remains the backbone of New Zealand’s economy, but methane from sheep and cattle has made it one of the world’s highest per-capita emitters. The initiative signals a pragmatic approach to balancing economic stability with global climate commitments, though critics say the voluntary measures may fall short of what’s needed to meet the country’s 1.5°C target.

Outlook: Stability Through Strategic Execution If successful, Hut 8’s transformation could make it one of North America’s most formidable independent data-center operators, leveraging its legacy energy expertise to supply the AI economy.","Hut 8 Corp. (NASDAQ: HUT) emerged as one of Canada’s largest Bitcoin miners, but over the past two years, the Toronto‑listed (TSX) firm has been quietly reinventing itself as a diversified energy-infrastructure company.

Chief executive Asher Genoot argues that this “power‑first” model unlocks cheaper financing and steady cash flows by leasing capacity to both crypto miners and HPC users.

The question for investors is whether this pivot is paying off.

Expanding a Digital Infrastructure Empire

Hut 8 has been busy building. In August the company advanced 1.53 gigawatts (GW) of U.S. development projects out of exclusivity and into construction. The company’s assets include a 300 megawatt (MW) “River Bend” campus in Louisiana, a 1 GW site and a 180 MW site in Texas, and a 50 MW facility in Illinois.

Genoot says commercialization of these sites would “double” the company’s scale and push its platform above 2.55 GW of capacity across 19 sites.

Hut 8 reported Q2 2025 revenue of $41.3 million and net income of $137.5 million. The company now manages more than 1,020 MW of power capacity with another 10.8 GW in early-stage development — effectively recasting itself from a crypto miner into a digital-infrastructure developer.

Wall Street’s Take on Hut 8’s Transformation

The pivot has drawn measured approval from Wall Street analysts. Benchmark analyst Mark Palmer raised his HUT price target to $36 per share (from $33) in July, citing Hut 8’s plan to double managed power capacity to 2.55 GW and its $2.4 billion liquidity. Piper Sandler and Cantor Fitzgerald initiated coverage with overweight ratings and targets around $33–$35, praising the energy asset portfolio and partnerships with chip‑maker Bitmain. These numbers are already out of date as Hut 8’s stock price closed above $43 last week.

Roth Capital went further, boosting HUT’s target to $60, arguing that leasing long‑term power contracts to hyperscale customers could re‑rate Hut 8 as a data‑center operator rather than a crypto miner. On average, analysts tracked by AInvest assign a “Buy” rating with a $27.82 target, even after a late‑September selloff knocked HUT shares down 7 percent. Again, the price has recovered dramatically since this price prediction.

Institutional ownership has climbed from roughly 12 percent to 55 percent since early 2025.

Still, there are a couple of reasons for caution.

Challenges: Capital, Execution, and Environmental Pushback

Enthusiasm is tempered by concerns about capital intensity and execution risk. Benchmark’s Palmer noted that while Hut 8’s balance-sheet liquidity stands near $2.4 billion, its ambitions require multi-year financing and regulatory coordination across several states — a test few miners-turned-infrastructure firms have passed.

To add, Hut 8’s proposed facilities in Louisiana and Illinois have already drawn scrutiny from local communities over water usage and electricity demand. Environmental groups in Louisiana warn that massive AI data centers could “damage our already bleak living situations and environment.” Analysts also caution that rising electricity prices and tight labor markets could delay commissioning schedules and erode expected margins.

Financially, Hut 8’s earnings remain volatile. The firm’s Q1 2025 net loss of $134 million underscored the difficulty of maintaining profitability during the transition away from pure mining. Its “asset-light” approach relies on joint-venture financing — a $200 million revolving credit facility with Two Prime and a $130 million line with Coinbase, boosting liquidity to roughly $2.4 billion when combined with its 10,000+ Bitcoin reserve — and a $1 billion at‑the‑market (ATM) equity offering that some investors view as dilutive.

But beyond the numbers, the pivot raises a broader question: can a company built for volatility master the predictability demanded by infrastructure investors?

Outlook: Stability Through Strategic Execution

If successful, Hut 8’s transformation could make it one of North America’s most formidable independent data-center operators, leveraging its legacy energy expertise to supply the AI economy. Its long-term vision — to monetize power, not coins — aligns with the structural shift toward compute-intensive workloads and decentralized energy assets.

Yet the path forward depends on “flawless execution”: securing energy permits, closing customer contracts, and balancing environmental stewardship with growth — as is the case with IREN, and Riot platforms, Hut 8’s direct competitors. Wall Street’s early optimism suggests belief in that vision — but not blind faith.

As Roth Capital’s Darren Aftahi put it, Hut 8 is evolving from a Bitcoin miner into an energy-driven infrastructure play focused on AI. Whether it can do so profitably will determine if this bold pivot truly earns its Wall Street redemption.

Is nuclear power becoming cool in Colorado?

The state has had only one nuclear power plant, Fort St. Vrain near Platteville. And it was converted to natural gas in 1989 after 10 years of technical problems. The former Rocky Flats weapons plant, which produced plutonium triggers for nuclear bombs, drew thousands of protesters for years to the site north of Denver, including such prominent activists as Daniel Ellsberg and Beat poet Allen Ginsberg.

In 2004, Colorado voters were the first in the country to approve a renewable energy mandate for utilities. How has nuclear power, with its baggage of radioactive waste and the Three Mile Island partial meltdown, become a seriously considered option in today’s fuel mix?

Worry about the demand for electricity outstripping capacity and concerns about progress on cutting greenhouse gas emissions led state Rep. Alex Valdez, a Denver Democrat, to back legislation this year that defines nuclear power as “clean.” He sponsored House Bill 25-1040, which added nuclear to the energy sources that utilities can use to meet state clean energy targets.

“As a kid, I grew up in the ’80s when a lot of talk about nuclear was in relation to the weaponry that was pointed at each other between the Soviet Union and the United States,” Valdez said. “I think I just kind of lumped nuclear into the same conversations as most people do: around its negative uses, less desirable uses.”

Valdez got a different perspective when he was appointed to the nuclear working group at the National Conference of State Legislatures. The group visited France, which gets about 70% of its electricity from nuclear power. Roughly 19% of electricity in the U.S. comes from nuclear energy.

With some forecasts showing electricity demand rising dramatically, Valdez said the U.S. will have to add “a tremendous amount of energy” to the grid if it’s going to compete in quantum computing and other advanced technology.

A boom in data center construction driven by increasing the use of artificial intelligence is expected to escalate the need for more electricity generation.

Valdez, who spent most of his career in the renewable energy field, said the legislation he sponsored recognizes that the power generated by nuclear energy is carbon-free. “As we move toward our path to zero-carbon (energy), it can be included in the mix to get us there.”

Not ready for prime time

A lot of the current interest in nuclear power revolves around a new technology: small modular nuclear reactors, about one-tenth to one quarter the size of a conventional reactor. They’re billed as potentially less expensive, safer, easier to build and adaptable because modules can be added as more power is needed.

The technology is also still in the development and demonstration stage. Just a few are operating in China and Russia. No small modular reactors –SMRs– are in commercial use in the U.S.

“SMRs aren’t ready for prime time,” said Dennis Wamsted, an analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. “You will hear from developers and others about the advantages. The advantages right now are all on paper.”

The institute focuses on research into the economics of expanding the use of renewable energy.

“We are not fans of nuclear power because it costs too much and that cost has been consistently high over the years. We see no track record of it declining,” Wamsted said. “We certainly don’t see that happening with a new class of reactor that nobody’s built before and nobody’s run before.”

Noah Rott, a spokesman for the western region of the Sierra Club, said the environmental group feels that discussion around nuclear energy “is largely a distraction as utilities work to address electric load growth in the next decade.”

“Cleaner sources like wind, solar, demand response, energy efficiency and storage are the answer here,” Rott said in an email.

However, the concept of an energy source that can run 24/7 and emit no heat-trapping greenhouse gases when generating power is compelling. Denver International Airport CEO Phil Washington and Denver Mayor Mike Johnston said in August that the airport, the country’s third-busiest, planned to commission a study to explore the feasibility of building a small, modular nuclear reactor on its campus to meet the growing demand for electricity in the area and cut the use of carbon-emitting power.

The airport put the study on hold after complaints that city officials hadn’t talked to area residents first. The airport determined that a broader scope will best serve its interests and needs and will issue a request for information later this fall on multiple clean energy solutions, including reactors, after first receiving ideas and input from the community, spokeswoman Courtney Law said in an email Wednesday.

Nuclear power generation is the top choice of a local advisory committee for replacing coal at Xcel Energy’s Comanche power plants near Pueblo. Xcel has proposed tapping renewable energy, battery storage and natural gas when it stops burning coal by 2031.

But the Pueblo Innovative Energy Solutions Advisory Committee, established by Xcel and community members, said renewable energy facilities wouldn’t provide the same number of jobs and tax revenue for local governments that nuclear or gas facilities would. The committee is promoting installing SMRs.

Xcel Energy operates nuclear facilities in Minnesota and has said they’re not off the table for Colorado, but the new type of reactors likely won’t be commercially available when the utility has to replace its coal plants.

The Western Governors Association, WGA, held workshops in September at the Idaho National Laboratory, which focuses largely on nuclear energy.

The workshops were part of an initiative by Utah Gov. Spencer Cox called “Energy Superabundance: Unlocking Prosperity in the West.” Cox, the WGA’s chairman this year, said the country is looking to the West for ways to meet the surge in need for more electricity.

Idaho Gov. Brad Little said during a workshop that the U.S. won’t meet its energy needs “with our legacy energy.”

“We’re going to have to have scalable, safe nuclear energy,” Little said.

While it could be five to 10 years before small reactors are up and running in the U.S., Mark Jensen, a chemistry professor at the Colorado School of Mines, said the federal government is more involved in promoting nuclear energy than in the recent past. He noted that the Department of Energy has opened federal sites to allow companies to test prototypes and that could help streamline development.

President Donald Trump has issued executive orders intended to invigorate the nuclear power industry and streamline regulations.

Jensen, director of the nuclear science and engineering program at the School of Mines, said more private money is flowing into nuclear projects than he has seen over the past 35 years.

Wind, solar the ‘workhorses’

Jack Waldorf, WGA executive director, said in an email that advancements in nuclear energy provide the opportunity to expand clean, reliable generation of electricity, but achieving true energy abundance will require a comprehensive approach.

Gov. Jared Polis said in a statement that Colorado has a history as an innovator and nuclear energy should be no different. ” As projects become cost competitive and safer, we should view nuclear energy not as a competing energy source to wind and solar, but as a complementary solution for better overall reliability and lower costs.”

Will Toor, executive director of the Colorado Energy Office, agreed. He said as Colorado moves to more deeply cut emissions, other technologies will be needed and nuclear energy should certainly be in the mix.

“It’s pretty clear that wind and solar will be the workhorses of the grid just looking at the cost modeling,” Toor said. “You can build them relatively quickly and they’re so much cheaper than other resources.”

He expects nuclear power to be in a group of what he calls “clean, firm” energy sources: ones that emit low or no greenhouse gases and provide round-the-clock power. Toor said geothermal energy is likely the furthest along among those sources.

“The challenge with nuclear is really still the same challenge that it has been for utilities, which is the cost, how long it takes to build and the uncertainties of federal permitting,” Toor said.

He added that he would be surprised if Colorado utilities moved ahead with conventional nuclear or “to be first in line for the first-of-its-kind” small modular reactor.",https://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/TDP-L-img1332A_115195150.jpg?w=1024&h=717,N,,2025-10-13 11:02:04.921995

Donald Trump pledged to push for “American energy dominance” throughout his 2024 presidential campaign, powered by an aggressive expansion of domestic fossil fuel production. He kept that promise in his second administration while also eliminating billions of dollars in federal support for clean energy projects.

That hasn’t been good for Americans’ pocketbooks, though. Sure, a gallon of gasoline is slightly cheaper than a year ago, but that’s more than offset by higher electric power costs, with utility rates rising more than twice as fast as overall inflation. And it turns out that global demand for U.S. oil, gas and coal isn’t keeping up with worldwide sales of Chinese green energy technology.

Chinese exports of clean energy-related products this year through July total $120 billion, according to Bloomberg, using data from the U.S. Energy Department, Energy Information Administration, China’s GACC and energy researcher Ember. By comparison, the U.S. exported just $80 billion of carbon-based energy in the same period. It continues a trend seen after China’s clean energy exports totalled $180 billion in 2024, $30 billion more than the $150 billion the U.S. got selling fossil fuels around the world. The gap is likely widening–Chinese clean tech exports were worth $20.3 billion in August alone, according to Ember.

Rapid growth in renewable power demand around the world is easy to explain: it’s cheaper and can be installed faster than traditional sources of electricity. That’s why in the first half of 2025, additions of new solar and wind power were the fastest-growing source of electricity generation, overtaking coal worldwide for the first time. And in that booming market, China is by far the world’s dominant supplier. Unfortunately, Trump’s current policies and reversal of Biden-era programs ensure the U.S. will fall even farther behind.

Those now revoked tax credits helped to kick off a manufacturing boom in America, generating hundreds of billions of dollars in private investments and creating hundreds of thousands of jobs. New factories went up all over the country, making batteries, clean vehicles and energy-efficient products for businesses and homeowners. It was also bringing down energy costs for consumers. Now that momentum is reversing.

“In terms of the global arms race for clean energy jobs and investment, the U.S. went from the middle of the pack to the front basically overnight” with the Biden programs that Trump has eliminated, Senator Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said in a statement. But the budget bill Republicans passed on a party-line vote and that Trump signed into law this summer reversed that. “Manufacturing projects are being canceled. Jobs are being lost. Utility bills are rising.”

Trump may make good on his promise of increasing carbon energy output, but it’s a resource much of the world is losing interest in.

The Big Read

A $250 Million Plan To Pull Lithium For Batteries From The Great Salt Lake

The U.S. could become a major supplier of lithium for batteries in the next few years after the Trump administration took a stake in the developer of a massive mine in Nevada. But Silicon Valley startup Lilac Solutions thinks it’s got a better idea that avoids the higher costs and environmental harms of traditional mining: extract the pricey mineral from briny water at oil fields and sites like the Great Salt Lake in Utah instead of digging it out of the ground.

Oakland-based Lilac, which has been refining its patented ion-exchange technology for lithium extraction since its founding nearly a decade ago, is raising $250 million to build its first commercial processing facility at the Great Salt Lake that could produce 5,000 metric tons of lithium per year by 2028. If all goes well, that’s just the start as the company looks to help energy companies pull lithium out of massive underground brine deposits that are often a byproduct of active oil and gas fields across the U.S., such as the Smackover Formation, the remnant of an ancient sea that stretches from Texas to Florida, according to CEO Raef Sully.

Compared to the amount of lithium that can be pulled from conventional mines, “brine is probably orders of magnitude larger,” Sully told Forbes.

Brine projects in the Smackover region that companies such as Standard Lithium, ExxonMobil and Chevron are developing promise to yield hundreds of thousands of tons of lithium annually. The U.S. Geological Survey estimated in a study last year that there could be up to 19 million tons of lithium in the Smackover in Arkansas alone. “We estimate there is enough dissolved lithium present in that region to replace U.S. imports of lithium and more,” said USGS hydrologist Katherine Knierim, the study’s principal researcher.

Hot Topic

Former EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy, co-chair of America Is All In, on state and local efforts to fight climate change

Can you elaborate on what America Is All In is doing as the federal government reverses U.S. climate policy?

First, there's no ifs about it: We're not getting the kind of work at the federal level that we need to protect our health, our wellbeing, our economy. So we are really in what I would call a pickle at this point. But having said that, there are huge opportunities out there and we're going to grab them. [Cleveland] Mayor Bibb is my colleague and so are Governor Newsom and Governor Pritzker. It's about America is all in and damn it, we are all in. This federal government is not going to take away our rights and our ability to have a healthy environment and a strong economy, which is exactly the opposite of what they are doing.

America Is All In is about gathering together our mayors, our elected officials, our colleagues at the community level. It's about bringing people together with hope and opportunity. It's about forgetting what's going on in the federal government and actually doing what's right for all of us.

It's a great opportunity now. We're growing this initiative. America Is All In is really going to be about how we once again grab the opportunity of our lifetime and move forward. Regardless of what the federal government is thinking about or wants to do, we are going to take it over. We are going to work hard at the subnational level. We're going to work hard at the community level. And we're going to start building the kind of future our kids deserve. That's what America Is All In is about.

Are there some specific programs right now that you’re focused on?

We want to make sure that the Inflation Reduction Act continues to provide progress for us. One of the interesting things about it is not just that America Is All In is working domestically, but we're going to work internationally as well. Part of this is making sure people understand that we still have opportunities ahead and we have to grab those. We've lost a lot in the Inflation Reduction Act, but honestly, we have to move beyond that and understand the power of individuals and communities in this space. It's enormously important for us to have an international presence. If this president isn't interested in positioning us in a way that's going to keep us safe and healthy, then we have to do it ourselves. We just need to move forward. And the exciting thing is that we're not just expanding domestically, but internationally. We are going to be [at the upcoming UN Climate Change Conference] in Belém, [Brazil].

We are going to go beyond the United States of America so that people everywhere can see us again–so they don't just look at the Trump administration–but they look at the people in the United States and recognize that we are going to keep moving forward.

There are many opportunities that we have and I think you know them and certainly Mayor Bibb knows, but there are damages that we can't avoid. We have an administration that doesn't want to agree that climate change even exists. They're cutting out our scientists at the federal level, so they can't tell the truth about what's going on in the world. And this can go on and on and on and on. But the thing that I wake up every morning and say to myself is we can't let these people take away our sense of hope and opportunity. That's exactly what they want. They want us to get so angry that you're sitting around in a dither.

But I ain't dithering around, baby. We just have to get hold of ourselves. Really, we own this place. It's our country. So I'm excited about it and there's so many things that we're going to do both domestically and internationally that are going to remind people that we have the power. It is ours to use and we're just going to go after it.

EV and trade policies in the US may be to blame for these prices not being as low as Musk touted and analysts hoped.
As a result, Tesla's new cheaper models are still around $2,000 more expensive than what the flagship versions would have cost had the $7,500 EV credit remained in place.
How China has managed to make cheaper EVs Many models of BYD, a Chinese Tesla competitor, are selling in China for the equivalent of around $20,000.
While these practices created trade tensions and contributed to price wars among Chinese EV makers, consumers in China ultimately stood to benefit from more affordable EVs.","Tesla's price point for its ""more affordable"" models is still higher than Elon Musk, Tesla's CEO, floated in 2020. The reasons for these sticky prices may be bigger than Tesla.

On Tuesday, Tesla launched ""standard"" versions of the Model Y and Model 3, at $39,990 and $36,990, respectively.

The ""standard"" models are between $5,000 and $5,500 cheaper than the flagship versions — sans Autosteer and a radio — and the market was not enthusiastic. Tesla shares dipped around 4.4% after the launch on market closing compared to the day before.

EV and trade policies in the US may be to blame for these prices not being as low as Musk touted and analysts hoped.

""What I would criticize about the US's approach to EVs is that they're making it really hard to build supply chains,"" Travis Fisher, director of energy and environmental policy studies at the Cato Institute, told Business Insider.

Fisher pointed out that most critical minerals needed to make EV batteries are mined and processed in China. While some rare earths are exempt from tariffs, others, such as graphite, face a 93.5% duty. Additionally, batteries that are already assembled also face tariffs upon entry.

On October 9, China's leader, Xi Jinping, expanded restrictions on rare earth exports and said that an increase in exports would ""clog"" the markets.

Unlike other relatively affordable EVs sold in the US, like the Nissan Leaf and the Chevy Equinox, Tesla manufactures its cars for the US market in its Fremont Factory in California and Gigafactory Texas, where land, labor, and permits are already costly.

""When you slapped not just a large tariff, but a large and uncertain tariff on that type of trade, it is really hard to plan,"" said Fisher. ""If I were in the car business, thinking about building an EV or a hybrid and installing a bunch of batteries in the vehicle, I'm not sure what I would do.""

Trump's EV policies

To add to Tesla's pricing woes, the US is moving in the opposite direction in terms of EV policy compared to other major EV markets worldwide, especially China.

In January, Trump signed an executive order to suspend all disbursements of Inflation Reduction Act funding, a Biden-era package passed by Congress that aims to boost clean energy production and job creation in rural America. The set of 119 provisions includes up to $7,500 in tax credit for new EV buyers, credits for businesses purchasing commercial clean vehicles, and funding to build more charging stations.

In April, a federal judge ordered the Trump administration to take ""immediate steps"" to reinstate IRA funding that had already been awarded to projects.

However, the Big Beautiful Bill, which was passed by Congress and signed into law by Trump, still eliminated EV tax credits for all vehicles purchased after September 30. As a result, Tesla's new cheaper models are still around $2,000 more expensive than what the flagship versions would have cost had the $7,500 EV credit remained in place.

Tesla also used to be able to make an income by selling clean vehicle credits to combustion engine vehicle manufacturers that fail to meet emission standards, until Trump eliminated the fines on those automakers, which Fisher said may be limiting Tesla's financial ability to comfortably make a larger price cut.

How China has managed to make cheaper EVs

Many models of BYD, a Chinese Tesla competitor, are selling in China for the equivalent of around $20,000.

""If you look at China, it has the advantage of labor, and it is not as strict on environmental standards,"" said Fisher. ""And in terms of permitting and just getting things done, every permit is way harder to obtain in the US, and even if you do, there is a good chance you would get sued for it.""

The government is another factor. According to the Rhodium Group, China's government auto purchase subsidies are expected to reach a record high of 342 billion yuan in 2025, comprising 150 billion yuan in scrappage and trade-in subsidies, as well as 192 billion yuan in auto purchase tax exemptions. The research group estimates that this sum would be equivalent to 3% of the central government's fiscal revenues and account for 7% of passenger car retail sales this year.

The EU Commission called these subsidies an ""unfair"" trade practice last year and slapped up to 45.3% in duties on Chinese EVs in 2024, but many models, such as the BYD Atto 3 Comfort, remain competitive in the European market. While these practices created trade tensions and contributed to price wars among Chinese EV makers, consumers in China ultimately stood to benefit from more affordable EVs.

""Ideally, people should have access to the cars they want to buy, and the production of the vehicles should be based on consumer demand and not what candy the government's throwing at you,"" said Fisher. ""But if making the cheapest EV possible is the game, China is definitely winning at that game.""",https://i.insider.com/68e8475c1c1f80efbec55298?width=1200&format=jpeg,N,,2025-10-13 12:06:34.772439

According to figures presented at the annual meeting of the Spanish Energy Club, the country ranks second in Europe for foreign investment and fourth globally in sustainability.

These results reflect growing international confidence in Spain’s regulatory framework, technological diversity and the competitiveness of its electricity system — factors that have positioned it at the heart of Europe’s energy transition.

Spain’s role is further strengthened by a strategy centred on smart grids, energy storage and new industrial capacities linked to hydrogen and digitalisation.

In recent weeks, several public‑private agendas with Asia have underscored this international projection: Galicia completed an official mission to Japan to attract industrial investment; APPA Renovables promoted Spanish participation in the EU Business Hub Japan‑Korea programme and in China’s Battery Tour (13–17 October); and the Basque Hydrogen Corridor continues its collaboration with Japan through Basque Trade & Investment, JETRO and the Energy Cluster, with further joint actions planned for 2025 around hydrogen and its value chain.

As Europe seeks energy autonomy and resilience, the Iberian Peninsula emerges as a key space for green reindustrialisation. Spain and Portugal share a unique advantage: abundant natural resources, mature infrastructure and sustained political will that allow them to accelerate decarbonisation and attract international capital.

The international expansion of Spain’s renewable sector has found in Asia a strategic partner. According to Javier Muñoz, General Director of APPA Renovables, recent trade missions and institutional meetings with Japan, Korea, China and Thailand illustrate an increasingly solid relationship between complementary markets.

“Spain has reached a level of maturity that allows it to share regulatory and technological experience with countries in earlier stages of their energy transition,” Muñoz explained.

In this exchange, Asian countries contribute industrial and technological capacity that strengthens the Spanish value chain, while Spain’s regulatory know‑how and experience in renewable integration consolidate its position as an international benchmark.

Japan and Korea stand out for their expertise in engineering and digital networks; China for its photovoltaic and components industry; and Thailand for its bioenergy development based on agricultural resources. These strengths complement the Spanish ecosystem in fields such as renewable hydrogen, storage and smart‑grid management.

Opportunities and benefits for Spanish industry

The rapprochement with Asia marks a turning point in the internationalisation of Spain’s renewable sector. Muñoz noted that this exchange not only opens new markets but also redefines the industrial scope of clean energy: “We are moving from exporting projects to exporting knowledge. Sharing our regulatory and technical experience positions us as preferred partners in a global context that values stability and innovation.”

Collaborations with Asia aim to strengthen complementary value chains. Speaking to Strategic Energy Europe, the head of APPA Renovables explained that many Spanish companies are joining consortia for offshore wind tenders in Japan and Korea, while others are developing components and smart systems with Asian manufacturers already investing in plants within Spain. “Technology transfer is becoming a two‑way street: they provide industrial capacity, and we contribute design, regulation and integration expertise,” he said.

Within this framework, renewable hydrogen and bioenergy stand out as strategic cooperation axes. Thailand offers opportunities linked to its agricultural base, while Japan and Korea demand solutions for green‑origin certification and advanced logistics — areas where Spanish firms are beginning to excel.

“These alliances not only create contracts and jobs but also reinforce Spain’s image as a country capable of leading energy innovation through international collaboration,” Muñoz concluded.",https://strategicenergy.eu/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/unnamed-18.jpg,N,,2025-10-13 09:07:45.331319

“Our partnership with T1 Energy strengthens the foundation of US solar manufacturing.
Both T1 Energy and Talon PV have emerged as major players in the US solar manufacturing industry, leading efforts to produce domestic solar cells alongside firms like ES Foundry and Suniva.
For its part, T1 Energy has inked a “landmark” deal with Michigan-based manufacturing giant Corning to source US-made polysilicon and silicon wafers.
We published a series of interviews with leading figures in the US solar manufacturing industry in recent weeks.","T1 Energy did not disclose the stake it has acquired or the value of its investment. The companies have entered into a Simple Agreement for Future Equity (SAFE) and “remain in discussions to potentially deepen the strategic relationship in the future”.

“We are excited by the opportunity to invest in another American solar energy project that complements our G2_Austin development,” said Daniel Barcelo, T1 Energy’s CEO and chairman of the board. “Expanding the output of American solar cells is necessary to support energy security, achieve regulatory compliance and build an American solar industry based on advanced manufacturing and cutting-edge solar technology.”

Both Talon PV and T1 Energy are planning to produce tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) cells at their respective facilities. The technology has been the subject of much intellectual property litigation in the US, as various companies sought to establish TOPCon production lines.

However, Talon PV has acquired a TOPCon IP portfolio from cadmium telluride (CdTe) module manufacturer First Solar, which it told PV Tech Premium would clear the way for commercial TOPCon cell production in the US. It is unconfirmed whether the two companies plan to share intellectual property after the investment.

“Our partnership with T1 Energy strengthens the foundation of US solar manufacturing. Together, we’re building scalable, non-FEOC supply chains that deliver true domestic content and reinforce America’s energy independence and national security,” said Adam Tesanovich, co-founder and CEO of Talon.

Both T1 Energy and Talon PV have emerged as major players in the US solar manufacturing industry, leading efforts to produce domestic solar cells alongside firms like ES Foundry and Suniva. The industry has built around 50GW of solar module production capacity, but cells and other upstream components have been far slower to materialise.

For its part, T1 Energy has inked a “landmark” deal with Michigan-based manufacturing giant Corning to source US-made polysilicon and silicon wafers. Combined with its planned cell and module production facilities, the deal would see a fully US-made silicon solar supply chain realised and would mark a significant moment in the country’s PV manufacturing industry.

Pro-Trump solar manufacturers

T1 Energy said both its project and Talon PV’s site are “supported by President Trump’s OBBBA (One Big, Beautiful Bill Act) and 45X tax credits.”

The company, which was formed when it bought Chinese solar manufacturing giant Trina Solar’s US module manufacturing facility last year, has previously expressed support for tariffs on PV imports to the US.

It said that the looming Section 232 tariffs on all polysilicon imports would “boost” American manufacturing and that further antidumping and countervailing duty (AD/CVD) levies would “strengthen our efforts to build an American advanced manufacturing champion”. Barcelo has also expressed support for Donald Trump’s “reciprocal” global tariff regime on all imports to the US.

Other industry observers and analysts have been more critical of the impacts of the president’s policies on solar manufacturing. We heard earlier this year from Christian Roselund, senior policy analyst at Clean Energy Associates (CEA), who said that the OBBBA was more damaging for manufacturers than solar development, as the twin issues of a shrinking solar end market and the removal of tax incentives to use US products put pressure on many firms.

However, PV Tech reported earlier this year that US solar manufacturing capacity has increased by 800% since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in 2022, and module capacity is roughly equal to the size of the US market in 2024. Upstream components remain more challenging, and much of the US module market will still rely on increasingly expensive cell and wafer imports for the foreseeable future.

We published a series of interviews with leading figures in the US solar manufacturing industry in recent weeks. You can find them all on PV Tech Premium.

26 First Nations people have been selected from over 100 applicants to participate in PowerMakers, a transformative capacity building program for First Nations people pursuing clean energy solutions in homes, communities, and on Country.

Designed and delivered by the First Nations Clean Energy Network with assistance from trusted experts in government, academia and industry, and our clean energy kin in Canada, this year’s annual PowerMakers program is being held in Mparntwe (Alice Springs), Northern Territory from 13-16 October 2025.

Karrina Nolan, co-Chair of the First Nations Clean Energy Network says:

“PowerMakers is about supporting and resourcing our community members to have access to knowledge and expertise to really engage in the clean energy transition.

“In the last 5 years we’ve seen a significant shift in the role of our communities in the transition to clean energy.

“The First Nations Clean Energy Network’s members through connecting community, industry and government have changed the story about what's possible when we genuinely engage and consent to projects.

“However, irregular temperatures and climatic extremes are exacerbating energy insecurity issues.

“We know that it's possible to play a greater role in how energy is generated and supplied, to respond to changing weather conditions, sub-standard housing and affordability, and to determine, collaborate and benefit-share in projects.

“First Nations groups – assisted by previous PowerMaker cohorts sharing knowledge back home with communities – are aware that work needs to be done to ensure our people aren’t left behind in Australia’s clean energy transition.

“Energy systems are typically designed around the needs of governments or utilities, rather than community members, making it difficult for First Nations to access rooftop solar and batteries and the cost savings enjoyed by so many people in Australia.

“Access to capital and innovative finance mechanisms through Special Investment Vehicles must be made available to First Nations groups to build energy justice outcomes in communities and on-Country, such as community-led projects reducing diesel reliance and which improve energy aﬀordability.

“And embedding First Nations rights in law and process, and Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC) will accelerate Australia's renewable energy build-out, by reducing project delays, lowering risk, and unlocking underutilised economic resources.

“The 26 participants in this year’s PowerMakers are already doing trail blazing work advocating, planning or leading development of clean energy projects to secure affordable reliable energy, with others preparing for or skilled in negotiations with clean energy proponents around jobs and training, local procurement, benefit-sharing, equity participation, and sustainable values-based access to land and sea.

“PowerMakers is an investment in building the capacity and resourcing of communities towards First Nations ownership and economic development.

“By building on existing skills and knowledge, and sharing learnings and solutions, existing and emerging PowerMakers are ready to seek out, contribute to and benefit from the collective progress of First Nations leading the energy transition throughout Australia.”

PowerMaker 2025 participant Trinity Clarke, a Director of Jabalbina Yalanji Aboriginal Corporation in Queensland says:

“We’re very interested in sustainable clean and reliable power for our mob. Not having reliable power is something we experience every day.

“We have secured funding to build a community-owned microgrid in Wujal Wujal which is very exciting. We know the issues in our communities and it’s something we’ve wanted for a while.

“Owning our own energy means we can look at further aspirations around storing food, and setting up a dialysis clinic, and other measures most people around the country take for granted, but which stay out of reach when you don’t have reliable power.

“Right now we’re working hard to set up governance frameworks for our new majority Yalanji-owned power company backed by a partnership between Jabalbina Yalanji Aboriginal Corporation and Volt Advisory.

“PowerMakers will provide me with an opportunity to learn from other mob and share our power journey in Yalanji country.”

PowerMaker 2025 participant Mike Gilby, Director of Malyangapa Native Title Claimant Group from the tri-state pocket covering NSW, South Australia and Queensland says:

“Representing our native title group, I will use the opportunity at PowerMakers to sit and listen to what other Countrymen are doing on Country.

“I’ve been watching the evolution of clean energy over the past decade, starting with Snowy Hydro.

“My interest is hydro technology, and we’re looking at how we can repurpose the infrastructure already in place at those locks and weirs – from the Hume Dam all the way to the Murray Mouth, and we’re also looking at the clean energy corridors being constructed for transmission, with towers scattered along First Nations’ country.

“Our Malyangapa Native Title Claimant Group have had discussions with the clean energy industry, particularly around solar and wind farms. There’s no on-country projects yet but it’s certainly a conversation.

“It’s about thriving ecosystems that are driving our interests, to bring about some equilibrium in our part of the world.”

GM is halting development of its next-generation hydrogen fuel cells and closing its HYDROTEC division, including a $55 million Detroit facility.

The automaker will redirect investments toward electric vehicles, batteries, and charging technology, citing greater scalability and market demand.

The shift comes amid potential federal grant cancellations and underscores hydrogen’s limited infrastructure and high costs in the U.S.

General Motors will end development of next-generation hydrogen fuel cells under its HYDROTEC brand as it pivots more aggressively toward electric vehicles and battery technology.

As part of the move, GM laid off salaried employees primarily in Pontiac, Michigan, following the closure of its HYDROTEC plant. The company said it is prioritizing investments in EV technology and redirecting its workforce and supplier relationships toward that effort.

The decision reflects GM’s growing confidence in EVs and its doubts about hydrogen’s near-term viability for consumer applications. While hydrogen fuel cells offer quick refueling and long range, the high production cost and limited fueling network have restricted growth. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, there are only 61 hydrogen refueling stations nationwide compared to more than 250,000 Level 2 or faster EV charging locations.

Notably, GM will continue producing hydrogen fuel cells through Fuel Cell System Manufacturing LLC, a joint venture with Honda, to serve industrial and commercial sectors, including power generation, mining, and heavy trucking.

The move follows the Trump administration’s recent indication that it plans to cancel two federal grants totaling $52 million that were previously awarded to GM for hydrogen development projects in Pontiac. The federal government had already distributed $9 million of the funding before the potential reversal.

Human rights are now being targeted in the rush for critical minerals and new sources of non-fossil energy.
“Governments are repressing human rights defenders and the current trajectory is incompatible with the realization of human rights for all.
On Thursday Lawlor will repeat calls on governments to stop treating climate defenders like enemies, and instead work with them on a just transition to prevent climate catastrophe.","Human rights defenders organizing to prevent climate catastrophe are facing a surge in reprisals, as governments around the world denigrate, delegitimize and criminalize activists in spite of worsening global heating, a top United Nations official has told the Guardian.

Mary Lawlor, the UN special rapporteur for human rights defenders since 2020, has documented hundreds of cases where states have sought to smear and silence climate defenders engaged in peaceful protest, non-violent civil disobedience and litigation.

“Attacks against climate defenders have surged over the course of the mandate, and we now see outright repression against people who are organizing for climate action. It’s some of the states that have claimed to be the strongest supporters of human rights defenders including the UK, Germany, France and the US, that are most often repressing climate activists and where the right to protest is being denigrated and delegitimized.

“These big countries spew out the rhetoric about 1.5C, but they don’t mean it. They are playing the game to suit themselves. It’s business as usual,” Lawlor said in an interview with the Guardian.

Lawlor will present the penultimate report of her six-year mandate, “Tipping points: Human rights defenders, climate change and a just transition”, to the UN general assembly on 16 October.

It documents state repression including police violence and surveillance, civil litigation deployed to deliberately wear down and silence climate defenders known as Slapp (strategic lawsuits against public participation), as well as bogus criminal charges ranging from sedition, criminal defamation, terrorism and conspiracy to trespass, to public disorder and to disobedience.

In December 2023, the Just Stop Oil member Stephen Gingell became the first person to be jailed under the UK’s new public order legislation after taking part for 30 minutes in a peaceful slow-march protest on a London road.

“The UK is leading by bad example, abusing the international standards to which it itself agreed by bringing in these draconian laws that are designed to stop protest against any of the issues that are uncomfortable for the UK government.”

In the US, about 1,000 criminal cases were brought in Minnesota against people involved in non-violent actions against the Line 3 oil pipeline, including charges of attempted assisted suicide and trespass on critical infrastructure. While most cases were eventually dismissed or overturned, legitimate concerns about Indigenous lands, environmental harm and climate impacts were ignored and the pipeline began operations in 2021.

The criminalization of Line 3 protesters mirrored the repression seen during the 2016 Indigenous-led movement against the Dakota Access pipeline in the US. “Both instances entailed close collaboration between the companies involved and the police, indicating the adoption of a blueprint for the repression of climate activism in the United States,” the report states.

The Guardian has previously reported on a criminalization playbook used against climate and environmental activists, that is being adopted and shared in the US and internationally.

One trend documented by Lawlor is the conflation of non-violent climate action with terrorism. In 2022, the French minister of interior at the time, and current minister of justice, accused the national environmental movement Les Soulèvements de la Terre of “ecoterrorism”. The government sought to close down the group, but the country’s highest administrative court eventually overturned the effort.

Lawlor is adamant that climate activists are human rights defenders. They use non-violent protest, disruptive civil disobedience and litigation to stop fossil fuel projects and pressure elected officials to take meaningful action precisely because they are trying to protect the right to food, clean water, health, life and a healthy environment.

“These people are exercising the right to defend human rights. Of course some climate groups are disruptive, but that’s because they tried so hard for so long to use normal run of the mill techniques to achieve change, and the government did nothing. Look at change throughout the century by people like Martin Luther King and Gandhi, civil disobedience is sometimes necessary,” said Lawlor, who is the founder and former executive director of Front Line Defenders and former director of the Irish branch of Amnesty International.

But it’s not just fossil fuels. Human rights are now being targeted in the rush for critical minerals and new sources of non-fossil energy. The same repressive playbook is being used by governments and private companies involved in land grabs, pollution and Indigenous rights violations in pursuit of a green transition.

In Vietnam, which has committed itself to a just transition and net-zero emissions by 2050, the environmental lawyer Dang Dinh Bach was sentenced to five years in prison in January 2022 on bogus charges of tax evasion. Bach, who is among several climate activists imprisoned in Vietnam after advocating for the transition away from coal, is a victim of arbitrary detention, according to UN experts.

In Kenya, police fired rubber bullets and teargas at villagers in Uyombo in 2024, who were peacefully protesting against construction of a nuclear power plant facility on their land without consent.

“Governments are repressing human rights defenders and the current trajectory is incompatible with the realization of human rights for all. It’s just a road to destruction … I think states are behaving in a criminal fashion,” Lawlor said.

On Thursday Lawlor will repeat calls on governments to stop treating climate defenders like enemies, and instead work with them on a just transition to prevent climate catastrophe.

In 2013, the Environmental Protection Agency recommended stricter limits after new research showed mussels, snails and other aquatic life are more sensitive to ammonia than previously understood.

""EPA included additional species in its calculations, and the new recommendations are stricter than what's in our current regulations,"" said Mike Kruse, environmental program manager for the Missouri Department of Natural Resources' Watershed Protection Section. ""We're proposing to adopt those standards to better protect aquatic life in Missouri streams and lakes.""

Unlike a single fixed number, ammonia criteria typically use formulas that vary depending on factors such as pH, or water temperature. Missouri regulators plan to calculate limits by using region-specific standards.

Kruse said the impact will be felt most by small rural communities that rely on lagoon systems, which were not designed to treat ammonia at the stricter levels. ""Upgrading them would mean essentially rebuilding the treatment plant,"" he said. ""For small communities with shrinking populations, that's a pretty significant cost.""

To ease the transition, the state is offering variances — temporary exceptions that let facilities show the highest level of treatment they can realistically achieve and request more time to comply with the new federal standards. Larger city plants must also meet the new requirements, but their infrastructure is better-equipped to handle the changes without major upgrades, Kruse said.

The DNRC held an open house this week to guide community representatives through the variance application process. Additional sessions are planned in the coming months.

The proposal now enters an 18-month public rulemaking process that includes writing a regulatory impact report followed by public comments and review by Missouri's Clean Water Commission, all before statewide enforcement.

This has been well reported, but the consequences of these changes on the private, not-for-profit sector, has not received as much attention.

The federal bureaucracy is an easy target for its critics. It has no coherent master plan. It began with core duties of any country (defense, diplomacy, treasury) but then had manage the geographic growth of the country. Then industrialization often erased state borders and federalized many policy areas. At key moments, constituency groups like veterans, labor groups, agricultural interests etc. requested government attention and regulatory agencies developed from periodic market failures, new technologies, or to quash discrimination. The resulting crazy quilt of agencies and departments is easy for critics to question.

Further, just as the federal government grew, significant corruption reforms led to civil servants being hired based on their expertise rather than political allegiance. The resulting neutral competence is beneficial, but does collide with principles that presidential elections provide clear mandates to govern. We both want neutral experts to craft policies but also want elections to matter, which has frustrated presidents long before President Trump, but it’s particularly vivid in this polarized age.

Consequently, the strange structure, tension between neutral competence and electoral responsiveness, and a particularly American resistance to centralized government has formed a conventional wisdom that the federal bureaucracy is way too big and clumsy.

International comparison

Interestingly, the US public sector is far smaller than other democracies. Federal, state, and local public sector employment in the US is around 25% lower than most European democracies, which matches the level that American government spending is lower than European Union countries’ public expenditures, despite far greater spending on defense in the US. Our taxes as a percentage of our overall economy are 25% to 40% lower than these countries as well.

Europeans are perfectly comfortable with a larger governing role in society. European Social Democrats and even European Conservative parties dominate elections and both believe that taxing and redistributing wealth bring social equality and stability. Despite our polarized rhetoric, both American parties prefer lower taxes and spending relative to European mainstream parties.

While American skepticism toward big government is deeply baked into our political culture, that does not mean Americans support dramatic cuts in practice. The Pew Research Center finds that a majority of Americans favor most federal agencies and, except for ICE, Justice, and the IRS, all named agencies have more people favoring them than not. Further, most public policy research indicates that the federal government performs well on efficiency relative to other democracies. And before DOGE, the Government Accountability Office has long closely audited government agencies and publicly reported inefficiencies, waste, and policies that didn’t measure up.

Whether the DOGE cuts are legal or responsible is being decided by courts and Congress. One ironic, less-discussed problem that may emerge from such sudden cuts is there potential harm for the not-for-profit sectors that Americans prefer tackling social issues like health, human services, education, and the arts.

Again, a comparative historical look is helpful. Most European countries fully democratized after the socialist movement, which simultaneously pressed for equality and democracy and created the welfare state systems. American democracy began well before the pressures of the industrial revolution and Americans, who had the right to vote across classes even if not gender and race, rejected socialism and large-scale welfare state. So American beliefs of individualism and limited government meant that civil society — churches and not-for-profits — tackled thorny social problems more so and prior to the federal government.

Leveraging the non-for-profit arena

When the US government did later step into these social issues due the scale of hardship from the depression and social inequalities, its policies leveraged not-for-profit partners rather than directly handling issues with government agency employees. This grant-based approach is a very American approach of strengthening civil society addressing policy problems rather than a government takeover.

The Urban Institute reports the level of these federal grants. About 27% of health, human services, education and arts-based not-for-profit groups receive federal grants, which is almost identical to the 26% of such Indiana not-for-profits that receive these federal grants. Two-thirds of these groups receive less than 25% of their funds from federal, state, or local grants, so the majority of their funding comes from the private sector.

It’s healthy to debate how much government should be spending, but during the debate it should be considered whether sudden cuts to what is around 25% of not-for-profit budgets could permanently damage groups doing social work. For instance, the network of groups that carries out humanitarian aid around the work that received USAID grants have been devastated by the USAID grant cuts. If major humanitarian issues develop — on top of those existing crushing ones — the private sector groups may be defunct or lack the capacity to address those problems.

Moving forward, it’s vital to consider the balance of public funds to the private sector. There’s consensus among Americans that civil society should be dealing with social issues. Consequently, ensuring that civil society groups thrive must be considered in the pace and level of cuts.",https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/PA105187-2048x1536.jpg,N,,2025-10-13 08:01:28.848971

In 2013, Knappe and the EPA scientists were curious about a new chemical that DuPont had been manufacturing at Fayetteville Works.
Only then can the agency propose a national primary drinking water standard and goal for the contaminant.
The Safe Drinking Water Act stipulates that changes to the standards can only be more protective, not less.
“What Zeldin has announced is clearly in violation of the law, in addition to harming over 100 million Americans and their drinking water,” Zhuang said.","This story is published in partnership with Inside Climate News and WHQR. It is the first in an ongoing series about the PFAS crisis in North Carolina, “Forever War.”

Emily Donovan stood before 100 people in the pews at Ocean View United Methodist Church in a small seaside town in Brunswick County, North Carolina. It was May, the start of beach season. She had invited a scientist to speak about the astronomical levels of PFAS—nicknamed “forever chemicals”—that had been detected in sea foam four miles away.

But before she began her presentation, Donovan, a co-founder of Clean Cape Fear, had to deliver some bad news. That morning, Lee Zeldin, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency administrator appointed by President Donald Trump, had announced his intention to rescind drinking water regulations for several types of PFAS compounds.

The rollbacks included GenX, one of dozens within a family of chemicals that have contaminated the region’s drinking water and have been linked to disorders of the liver, kidneys and the immune system, as well as low birth weight and cancer.

Donovan felt devastated and enraged.

“Churches in Brunswick County baptize their babies in PFAS-contaminated tap water,” Donovan told the crowd. “We fought so hard. And now our hard work is getting rolled back.”

In 2013, scientists first discovered seven different types of PFAS in the Lower Cape Fear River, the drinking water source for several public utilities in the region. The insidious chemicals were eluding traditional water treatment systems and flowing through the taps of hundreds of thousands of people.

The scientists traced many of the compounds to Chemours’ Fayetteville Works plant, 80 miles upstream. State and federal documents show that for 40 years Chemours and its predecessor, DuPont had been quietly tainting the drinking water of a half-million North Carolinians.

It took several years for that information to reach the public, but once it did, Donovan and her fellow environmental activists, as well as public interest lawyers, state legislators, and local residents, started urging the EPA and state officials to regulate the compounds.

Many activists went to Congress and to the courts. Clean Cape Fear even pleaded its case to United Nations special rapporteurs on human rights, who concluded last year that PFAS contamination coming from the Chemours facility constituted “a business-related human rights abuse.”

Meanwhile, the scope of the contamination expanded throughout the state. Scientists found PFAS in fresh vegetables and fish, eggs, and beer. Pine needles, honey, and house dust. Landfills, compost, and sewage sludge.

Blood of horses. Blood of dogs. Their own blood.

Finally, the environmental advocates prevailed. In 2024, Michael Regan, North Carolina’s former top environmental regulator who’d become President Joe Biden’s EPA administrator, announced his agency would regulate five types of PFAS, including GenX, in drinking water.

The celebration was brief.

Now, here was Trump back in the White House, and Zeldin—with support from the chemical industry—began dismantling those hard-won protections.

And now, here were North Carolinians, prepared to battle anew for the health of their communities. To stop Chemours from dumping GenX in landfills. To force the company to pay for drinking water it had defiled. To halt the expansion of the Fayetteville Works plant.

“This is a motivator, not a deflator,” Donovan said, a few weeks after Zeldin’s announcement. “We’re going to continue to fight this, now, more than ever.”

2013-2016: A Movement Is Born

The Cape Fear River begins 200 miles upstream from Wilmington, at the confluence of the Haw and the Deep rivers.

On its journey to the Atlantic Ocean, the Cape Fear rambles through forests of loblolly pine and courses under plains of concrete. About halfway to the sea, where the river grazes Chemours’ Fayetteville Works plant, the company was releasing PFAS into the waterway.

Had it not been for Detlef Knappe and several scientists, including Mark Strynar and Andy Lindstrom of the EPA, Chemours could still be doing so.

Knappe is a distinguished professor of civil, construction, and environmental engineering at N.C. State University in Raleigh. He grew up in southern Germany in the small town of Freudenstadt, which translates to “City of Joy.”

Now a lean, ruddy man in his 50s, Knappe has retained shards of his German accent, but its edges have been softened, like rocks weathered by water. He is quiet and modest, and never boasts that he was among the scientists whose findings launched an environmental movement.

In 2013, Knappe and the EPA scientists were curious about a new chemical that DuPont had been manufacturing at Fayetteville Works. It was a replacement for PFOA, another “forever chemical” used in stain-resistant carpet, waterproof apparel, and nonstick cookware, which the company agreed to phase out by 2015 due to its health risks.

Coincidentally, the EPA scientists soon stumbled across a pamphlet from DuPont that named the mystery chemical: GenX.

Knappe had preserved water samples from the Cape Fear River for a different project. When the scientists analyzed the samples for GenX, they found average levels in Wilmington at 600 parts per trillion, with spikes reaching 4,500 ppt.

“We all felt that was really high,” Knappe said. “But how do you communicate that information? There’s this mystery chemical, GenX, and we weren’t aware of much information about its toxicity.”

The scientists were right: The levels were as much as 450 times what later became the drinking water standard. Their analysis found GenX was passing through the treatment system at the Sweeney Water Treatment Plant in Wilmington. Residents were drinking, bathing, and playing in contaminated water.

As the scientists worked on a paper that contained their new findings, the EPA lowered the health advisory for PFOA and another forever chemical, PFOS, to 70 ppt. While the advisory didn’t apply to GenX, the scientists were concerned about the potential health effects of the new compound, given its high levels in the drinking water.

We have to publish that paper now, Knappe thought.

When the paper came out in November 2016, he shared the findings with state regulators and utilities, but without toxicity data, no one knew what to make of it.

Then a freelance reporter for the Wilmington Star-News, Vaughn Hagerty, happened upon the scientific paper online. On June 6, 2017, he broke the story of the scientists’ findings.

People protested in the streets. Residents mobilized on Facebook.

“What was surprising and gratifying was the impact that article made,” Knappe said. “And how, maybe for a moment, politics stopped.”

2017-2018: Clean Cape Fear

Donovan is in her 40s, with chin-length, dark brown hair and glasses. At 5 foot 10, she is swan-like and often towers over a crowd. She worked in corporate marketing for a decade, then moved to Leland, in Brunswick County, from Charlotte with her husband in 2009. At the time, she was pregnant with twins, a boy and girl.

She became a stay-at-home mom and for seven years taught Bible study at Little Chapel on the Boardwalk in Wrightsville Beach. After noticing some children were praying for the health of their loved ones, Donovan said she heard God call her to become an environmental advocate.

In June, she and several concerned residents, including Cape Fear Riverkeeper Kemp Burdette, social activist and retired obstetrician Dr. Jessica Cannon, and former Wilmington Mayor Harper Peterson, gathered at Peterson’s wooden dining room table to discuss how to handle the crisis.

The demonstrations had been powerful, but diffuse. The activists decided they had to channel the public’s anxiety into a coherent movement. They called the group Clean Cape Fear.

In Raleigh, Michael Regan had been the head of the N.C. Department of Environmental Quality for just six months. He was homegrown, having been raised in Goldsboro, about an hour southeast of the capital. He graduated from the historically Black N.C. A&T University in Greensboro before heading to Washington, D.C., for an advanced degree in public administration.

Water pollution and obscure contaminants weren’t Regan’s specialty. He had worked in air quality and clean energy programs at the EPA, and later at the Environmental Defense Fund.

Now as head of DEQ, Regan was facing the type of daunting challenge that can define a leader’s legacy.

2017-2018: Stymied at the Legislature

Republican State Rep. Ted Davis Jr. is 75, a trim man with wire-rimmed glasses. A former state and federal prosecutor, he grew up in New Hanover County and drank water from the Cape Fear River for most of his life.

Like most people, Davis knew nothing about PFAS. But as an advisory member of the Joint Environmental Review Commission, he hoped his colleagues would support funding for local governments to address pollutants, monitor the river’s quality and hold hearings on the PFAS contamination.

Yet after a contentious commission meeting in 2017, the Senate declined to hold another one.

Undeterred, Davis approached Republican Tim Moore, then the House speaker, and asked to form a special committee. “I said, ‘Tim, I don’t give a damn whether the Senate is going to support it or not,’” Davis recalled. “‘This is too important.’”

Davis, who became the senior chairman of the resulting House Select Committee on North Carolina River Quality, presided over seven lengthy meetings with toxicologists, state regulators, scientists and other experts.

Still, several legislators fell in line with the industry’s talking points. State Rep. William Brisson, a former Democrat from Bladen County who had switched parties, downplayed the compounds’ toxicity. “It’s not like the mice fell over dead when they were injected with GenX,” he said at the committee hearing.

Those hearings prompted Davis to introduce the Water Safety Act. But only one of the bill’s provisions became law: a $450,000 allocation to the Cape Fear Public Utility Authority to test the finished drinking water and to install a temporary advanced treatment system was eventually folded into the state budget.

On the Democratic side, state Rep. Deb Butler, an attorney who represents New Hanover County, was having even less luck than Davis in advancing PFAS legislation. Some of her bills called for an outright ban on PFAS, including their use in firefighting foam and consumer packaging. Most of the measures died in committee; some never got a hearing.

“One of the things I’ve learned in the last eight years is that things that shouldn’t be politicized are, and the environment is one of them,” Butler said earlier this summer. “We all drink the water and we breathe the air, and some of us just don’t seem to care about cleaning it up.”

2018: A Prayer Circle and Cancer

Brian Long, the plant manager at Fayetteville Works, paced the floor before more than 100 people at Faith Tabernacle Christian Center. He wore an orange Chemours pin on the lapel of his sport jacket.

It was a cloudy evening in June 2018. The company was hosting a public event in St. Pauls, a small town two hours from Wilmington, to assuage the community’s fears about GenX.

“There’s been a lot reported on this compound,” Long told the frustrated, angry crowd. “We have decades of evidence and studies that suggest this compound—at the levels we see in our environment—do not cause health risks.”

EPA and academic scientists soon found that even at low levels, GenX was associated with harm to the liver, kidneys and immune system.

Rates of thyroid cancer declined in New Hanover and Brunswick counties, according to National Cancer Institute data from 2017 to 2021, the most recent figures available. However, those two counties still rank second and fifth, respectively, for thyroid cancer rates in North Carolina, data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show.

Kidney cancer rates rose in Brunswick and Pender counties during that time, according to federal data. Pender County leads North Carolina in rates of testicular cancer.

Local residents had begun reporting their experiences with cancer and other health problems. Some risk factors, such as age and genetics, make it difficult to establish causation between their illnesses and exposure to PFAS. Yet thyroid, testicular, brain, and other cancers have been linked to the compounds.

New Hanover and Brunswick counties had some of the highest rates of thyroid cancer in North Carolina, according to the state cancer registry. Rates of testicular cancer were also significantly elevated in nearby Pender County, which later detected high levels of PFAS in its drinking water.

Several advocates felt illnesses in their family might be linked to PFAS exposure. Donovan’s husband, David, had been diagnosed with a benign brain tumor that caused him to go blind until a surgeon removed it.

Dana Sargent, then with Cape Fear River Watch, was worried about her older brother, Grant Raymond, who had been diagnosed nine months before with a malignant brain tumor. He had been exposed to high levels of PFAS while a U.S. Marine and throughout his career as a Chicago firefighter. Doctors had given him less than five years to live. He was only 45.

Sargent, now 51, is from the Chicago area and arrived in North Carolina by way of California and Washington, D.C. She is short and petite, with long, flowing brown hair. She specializes in research, but her other quality is bluntness.

She attended the meeting, which began with a prayer circle that included Chemours. “It was asinine and repulsive to hold a meeting in rural North Carolina, in a church—to help shut people up,” she said. “They knew what they were doing.”

One man in the second row told Long that because of contamination in his neighborhood, he couldn’t sell his house.

“I understand you’re frustrated,” Long said, three times.

The man became angry, and as law enforcement led him out of the church, he told Long, “You have defiled the house of God.”

2018-2019: Chemours Cuts a Deal

Here’s Kemp Burdette, the Cape Fear Riverkeeper, on how to snag an alligator to test its blood for PFAS:

Get a treble hook, the kind used to catch a marlin.

Cast the rod over the alligator, which should be lying in the water. Reel in the line until the hook reaches the alligator, then jerk it with all your strength.

Steer the tired alligator to the bank.

Then, everyone jumps on the alligator (multiple humans, if possible).

Finally, tape the alligator’s mouth shut. Stick a 20-gauge needle at the base of its skull to draw 15 milliliters of blood.

Burdette helped N.C. State University and EPA scientists apprehend alligators in the Cape Fear River and several nearby lakes to test their blood for PFAS. Alligators can live long lives in contaminated water, so they can serve as models for detecting human health problems.

The scientists sampled the blood of 75 alligators and found 14 types of PFAS at concentrations similar to levels found in the blood of Wilmington residents. High levels of PFOS would later be found in several species of freshwater fish, prompting the state health department to advise people to eat no more than seven servings a year. Pregnant women should eat none.

It had been more than a year since the contamination became public, and Burdette was fed up with what he viewed as DEQ’s inertia and Chemours’ negligence. He pestered the attorneys at the Southern Environmental Law Center: We’ve got to do something.

Geoff Gisler, then a senior attorney at SELC, began to strategize, but it soon became apparent to him what needed to happen.

“We sued,” Burdette said.

SELC alleged DEQ was failing to uphold the North Carolina Constitution, a section of which obligates the agency to protect the environment and human health from the effects of pollution. The law center also filed suit against Chemours, alleging it had violated the federal Clean Water Act.

By the fall of 2018, DEQ and Chemours were trying to make a deal.

“In some ways it was a very sterile process,” Burdette recalled. “But it was also very tense. I felt like we didn’t need to do a whole lot of negotiating because we were right. They had poisoned the drinking water supply, and the state had let them do it. I didn’t want to compromise, and I think we did as little of that as we possibly could.”

By February 2019, the parties had crafted a consent order. Among the many provisions in the 46-page document was a requirement for the company to sample private wells for a dozen types of PFAS and to provide clean water to households whose wells were contaminated above certain thresholds.

No longer could Chemours discharge wastewater into the river as part of its manufacturing processes. No longer could the company expel hundreds of tons of GenX from its smokestacks; it had to reduce the emissions by 99.9 percent.

DEQ, too, had specific duties to hold Chemours accountable, including levying a record $13 million civil penalty.

“I think it’s been a tremendous success,” Gisler said in a recent interview. “It was never the final word and would never fix all the problems, but it’s a big step in the right direction. It’s our view that the polluter has to pay, and that hasn’t been happening, because the state and the EPA had not been enforcing it.”

In retrospect, Sargent, the former head of Cape Fear River Watch, wishes the consent order had been tougher. But when the document was finalized, few, if anyone, could foresee the scientific advances in detection methods.

“We didn’t know then that there were 350 types of PFAS coming out of Chemours,” Sargent said. “There’s still people falling through the cracks.”

Some of those people lived in Brunswick County, where private drinking water wells and river water entering the Northwest treatment plant were contaminated. That plant served homes, businesses, and schools, including the one Donovan’s young children attended.

“It sickens me to think I may have hurt my children by letting them drink that tap water,” Donovan testified before the U.S. House Oversight Subcommittee in 2019. She urged its members to pass a law banning the manufacture of the compounds. “I will forever wonder if one day that will cause them medical harm.”

At the hearing, she named her friends—Sarah, Tom, Kara—all young, all with rare or recurrent cancers.

“I am begging you to engage your humanity, to find the moral courage,” Donovan said. Her voice cracked. “To protect the most valuable economic resource—human life. Because it’s already too late for some of us.”

Some of Donovan’s friends have since died. “They left kids who are questioning their faith, wondering why God hates them so much that they gave their parents cancer and didn’t save them,” Donovan said. “The people who fought so hard to get answers of what caused their cancer died not knowing.”

Sargent’s brother, Grant, was among them. In December 2019, two years and three months after his diagnosis, his brain tumor killed him.

2021-2022: Quest for Accountability

One spring day, Donovan spotted odd-looking sea foam near the Ocean Crest Pier in Oak Island, a popular spot for saltwater fishing. She learned that the best time to find the foam is after a storm or on extremely windy days, when the water is agitated. She scanned live beach video feeds and local social media chats, where people posted photos of the foam blooms.

Her sightings, as it turned out, were not isolated to the coast. State officials had seen similar foam at 15 other spots, including in Falls Lake near Raleigh and a stream in the southern foothills of the Appalachian mountains.

Eventually Donovan collected samples from 13 sites in the Cape Fear River and along the coast, including near airports and military installations, which often use firefighting foam that contains the compounds. N.C. State scientists began an analysis, a process that took more than a year.

In Raleigh, Davis, the Republican representative from New Hanover County who had successfully negotiated for GenX funding, was still trying to pass legislation to hold Chemours accountable. He sponsored a new bill, “PFAS Pollution and Polluter Liability,” that would require that polluters who discharged PFAS into a public water system pay for treatment costs to remove the compounds.

“I’m going to fight for my constituency,” Davis said at a hearing of the House Judiciary Committee. “If the gentleman from Chemours really wants to show they care, why don’t they pay to make the water safe from the contamination they put in that river?”

The legislation was referred to the Agriculture and Environment Committee, but, like several PFAS-related bills before it, never received a hearing.

In the same legislative session, Butler, the New Hanover County attorney now in her second term as a representative, sponsored House Bill 444. It was more aggressive than Davis’ bill and extended liability to dischargers of the compounds, not only the manufacturers.

The bill had more than 20 co-sponsors, including a Republican, Frank Iler of Brunswick County. It never received a committee hearing.

2024: At the EPA, Regan Delivers

Michael Regan had overseen North Carolina’s PFAS crisis as DEQ secretary, but a hostile legislature and an indolent EPA under the first Trump administration hamstrung much of his effort to change policy. In 2021, Biden empowered him to take steps to protect the nation’s drinking water in his new role as EPA administrator.

Yet three years had passed since Regan had joined the EPA, and environmental advocates were becoming impatient with what they viewed as the agency’s sluggish progress on regulating PFAS.

Then, on a warm morning in April, Regan returned to North Carolina, to Fayetteville, the Cape Fear River flowing behind him.

He had arrived to announce the first legally enforceable maximum concentration levels for PFOA and PFOS at 4 parts per trillion, and for GenX, PFNA and PFHxS at 10 parts per trillion. Several of the compounds were also regulated as a mixture.

Although the standards applied to only five of the 15,000 types of PFAS, they were something.

“This is the most significant action on PFAS the EPA has ever taken,” Regan said. “The result is a comprehensive and life-changing rule, one that will improve the health and vitality of so many communities across our country.”

Donovan credited the progress to the EPA’s openness to meeting with environmental advocates.

“We had conversations and incredible access to the EPA. We were given the same level of stakeholder value as the industries, maybe even more,” Donovan said. “The Regan we saw at the EPA was much more muscular than at DEQ.”

Not everyone applauded the regulations. Some conservative members of North Carolina’s Environmental Management Commission, which approves or disapproves rules proposed by DEQ, blanched at Regan’s announcement.

Michael Ellison, who was appointed to the commission by Senate President Pro Temp Phil Berger, has a history of downplaying concerns about the compounds. At a meeting that summer, Ellison asked, rhetorically, “For decades we’ve been making and discharging this stuff. How many people have died from PFAS poisoning?”

Sargent was sitting in the room. Her eyes watered. She thought of her brother and the cruelty of Ellison’s remark.

“He had no empathy,” she recalled. “He thought this was a joke.“

The American Water Works Association, a national trade group of public utilities, opposed the standards for financial reasons. The Biden administration had earmarked $2 billion to help utilities cover the costs of advanced treatment to remove the compounds, but that was a fraction of the estimated $30 billion needed for all of the nation’s affected water systems.

In North Carolina, more than 1,900 public water systems would be required to comply with the new rules by 2029. If the maximum contaminant levels had been in effect on the day of Regan’s announcement, the drinking water of at least 300 systems would exceed them.

Two months later, the trade group sued the EPA, arguing the agency hadn’t followed the legally required procedures when it made the rules.

Regan felt assured the standards could withstand a legal challenge. What he wasn’t accounting for was that in seven months Donald Trump would win a second term and that Regan’s successor would begin to brazenly repeal the standards.

May 2025: The Persistent Republican

It was after 7 p.m. on May 7, and the North Carolina House of Representatives had been debating bills for five hours. Davis, wearing a gray suit with a white pocket square and a red tie, rose from Seat No. 9 in the House chamber.

“We’ve had a long day and we’re all tired,” Davis said. “But I hope you’ll give serious consideration to what I have to say.”

Davis was a primary sponsor of a bill titled “PFAS Pollution and Polluter Liability,” modeled after his previous legislation. It was just two pages. Although it didn’t mention Chemours by name, the language was so specific, it could mean no one else.

If a PFAS manufacturer contaminated a public utility’s drinking water above federally permissible levels, it would have to pay for the installation, maintenance, and operation of a treatment system to reduce concentrations in finished drinking water to comply with those limits.

“You can make all the PFAS you want,” Davis told his colleagues, “but you can’t release it into the environment.”

A last-minute amendment—key to garnering enough votes for the bill to pass—narrowed the list of eligible public water systems to those that incurred costs of more than $50 million. Those were the systems in New Hanover, Brunswick, and Cumberland counties, which, without the bill, would pass the costs on to ratepayers.

“These costs should be the responsibility of the polluter,” Davis said. “It’s only fair.”

Unlike Davis’ previous PFAS legislation, this bill crossed party lines to include many Republicans. It had more than 40 co-sponsors, including some of the most progressive Democrats in the House.

The members began to vote. On the digital screens mounted in the House chamber, names of those voting yes lit up in green. After 26 seconds, nearly the entire screen was green. The bill passed 104-3.

Davis was ecstatic. It had taken five years for him to carry a Polluter Pays bill this far.

“I was tickled to death,” Davis said later. “That guy from Chemours,” seated in the gallery, “I could see he had a sick look.”

With the House in the win column, Davis now had to convince the Senate to support his legislation.

2025: Sea Foam and an Industry Unrestrained

A few hours before Donovan’s sea foam presentation at Ocean View United Methodist Church, Lee Zeldin, Trump’s EPA administrator, dropped the hammer. He would rescind Regan’s maximum concentration levels for GenX and three other PFAS compounds.

The EPA announcement was even more troubling in light of the results of the long-awaited study on the PFAS-laden sea foam.

Jeffrey Enders, a research assistant professor at N.C. State University, detected 42 types of PFAS, including some manufactured only by Chemours. One type that Chemours used as a replacement for a phased-out compound, PFO5DoA, was detected at 20,000 parts per trillion. In a different study, scientists had previously found PFO5DoA in 99 percent of the 344 Wilmington residents who provided blood samples.

Levels of PFOS, which has not been produced in the U.S. since 2002, were found in the foam as high as 8 million ppt—the highest concentration ever reported in published scientific journals.

After Enders’ presentation, people told their personal stories.

“I live in Brunswick County and have been exposed my entire life,” one woman said, including while she was pregnant. Her drinking water well had a total PFAS level of 300 ppt.

“Now my kids are having issues,” she said, as she began to cry. “This hits hard.”

June 2025: The Senate Takes Up the Bill

Three weeks later, Davis’ bill was up for discussion in the Senate Environment Committee.

A few Republican members had warmed to regulating Chemours. “We need to run this bill,” said state Sen. Tom McInnis, a Republican whose district includes Cumberland County, another heavily contaminated area. “The folks at Chemours are notorious for not doing what’s right.”

Some Democrats thought the bill didn’t go far enough, although they agreed to support it. “You’re trying to hold the most culpable company responsible,” said Sen. Julie Mayfield of Buncombe County. “I just want people to understand this might not solve the problem.”

“I wish we could get rid of it all, but that would be herculean,” Davis said. “This is a baby step, but it might put a little bit of fear in anyone who might make PFAS.”

The tension in the room tightened. A parade of industry lobbyists began speaking to the committee, including from Chemours.

Jeff Fritz of Chemours said state regulators knew in the early 2000s that DuPont, which later spun part of its business off as Chemours, was making PFAS, including GenX. That is true. However, state records show that while regulators knew about the manufacturing, the companies failed to disclose in their discharge permits that they were sending PFAS into the Cape Fear River.

Fritz also claimed that Chemours voluntarily decided to stop discharging all PFAS. But he omitted the fact that the company did so only under scrutiny by state regulators. And that Chemours failed to stop all discharges until a second state inspection discovered GenX was still entering the river from the plant.

The bill didn’t advance. It’s eligible to be heard again next year.

September 2025: Zeldin Targets GenX Rollback

In September, EPA Administrator Zeldin made good on his promise. The agency filed a motion in the U.S. Court of Appeals in the District of Columbia to vacate Regan’s maximum contamination levels for GenX and the three other PFAS compounds, siding with the American Water Works Association, a trade group that had opposed them.

“This is a flat-out victory for Chemours,” Donovan said. “They’re playing their game, and the Trump EPA is 100 percent caving to industry pressure.”

The argument hinges on what Zeldin alleges is an administrative misstep: When the EPA enacted the rule under Regan, it did so out of sequence.

The Safe Drinking Water Act requires the EPA to first publish a notice of intent to regulate a contaminant and seek public comment on whether it should, in fact, be regulated.

Only then can the agency propose a national primary drinking water standard and goal for the contaminant. That step requires another public comment period.

Zeldin alleges Regan’s EPA proposed and finalized a regulatory determination—as well as the regulation itself—“simultaneously and in tandem.” Without a second comment period, Zeldin argued, the agency “denied the public and the regulated community the opportunity to adequately comment on and participate in the rulemaking process.”

The EPA proposed the PFAS drinking water standards in March 2023 and provided a 60-day comment period, during which over More than 120,000 comments were submitted—including by those now challenging the rule, according to the SELC, which also provided comments.

The agency then published a detailed 4,570-page response to those comments.

Regan’s EPA proposed and finalized the standards simultaneously, instead of moving through each action separately. This, Zeldin argued, “denied the public and the regulated community the opportunity to adequately comment on and participate in the rulemaking process.”

Zeldin’s EPA intends to issue a draft rule rescinding the regulations for public comment this fall; a final rule on the maximum contamination levels (MCLs) is expected next spring.

A Chemours spokesperson said the company supports the EPA’s decision. “Chemours wholly supports setting reasonable and scientifically justified MCLs,” the spokesperson said, “but getting the science right is absolutely critical, and the evidence clearly demonstrates that the previous determination for GenX is flawed.”

Chemours is cherry-picking the facts, trying to “confuse the narrative,” Donovan said.

The EPA retained two independent scientific panels to review its findings. Over 135 pages, the 12 reviewers largely agreed with the conclusions, with minor suggestions; the agency incorporated many of them.

“Chemours is using this as their basis for saying the science is flawed,” she said. “That’s ridiculous.”

The company cited six scientific studies conducted from 2018 to 2023 that concluded GenX’s toxic effects on rodent livers could not be extrapolated to humans because of a genetic difference in how a protein behaves between the two species.

However, four of those studies included a conflict of interest statement from the scientists, many of whom work for private consulting firms, indicating the research had been done on behalf of Chemours.

EPA scientists challenged those Chemours-backed findings. They cited examples of how the protein in question is relevant to both species; in humans, medicines are developed to target that very protein.

More than 40 concerned parties have either petitioned to intervene in the case or to file briefs in support of keeping the standards: Prominent scientists, like Linda Birnbaum, a toxicologist and former director of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences; attorneys general from 17 states, including Jeff Jackson of North Carolina; and environmental groups, including Cape Fear River Watch and Clean Cape Fear.

It’s uncertain whether the rescission will survive a court challenge. Under the federal backsliding rule, the EPA can’t legally repeal the standards, said Jean Zhuang, senior attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center. The Safe Drinking Water Act stipulates that changes to the standards can only be more protective, not less.

“What Zeldin has announced is clearly in violation of the law, in addition to harming over 100 million Americans and their drinking water,” Zhuang said. “These industries, like Chemours, are fighting these drinking water standards because then the pressure is off them to control these chemicals.”

The same day that Zeldin filed the motion in federal court about the GenX standards, DEQ announced it was requiring Chemours to offer private well testing to an additional 14,000 residents in New Hanover, Brunswick, Columbus, and Pender counties.

This brings the total to more than 200,000 homes in 10 counties that are eligible for PFAS testing; of those, state records show nearly 7,500 have qualified for alternate water supplies as stipulated in the consent order.

Previous testing has found PFAS 400 feet deep, nearly to bedrock, and in wells as far as 28 miles from Fayetteville Works.

DEQ says it has not yet found the contamination’s edge.

In a time of rapid technological change and global geopolitical flux, the United States Department of Energy (DOE) is executing one of the most ambitious transformations in its history. At the intersection of science, economic policy, and national security, the Research, Technology, and Economic Security (RTES) framework represents a bold attempt to futureproof the nation’s energy architecture while ensuring responsible stewardship of public funds. In doing so, the DOE is not only refining how it governs federal investments but also how it positions America as a science and technology leader in a competitive global landscape.

The priorities of the DOE, the risk-based mechanisms underlying the RTES framework, and how those efforts are translating into tangible impacts, from protecting intellectual property (IP) and strengthening supply chains to fostering energy independence and global clean energy leadership, are evolving. The conversation comes at a critical time when American leadership in energy innovation could determine not just economic prosperity but also geopolitical leverage. Stakeholders from policy, industry, and academia will need to be aware of these changes, as they can gain particular value from understanding how the DOE is operationalizing RTES to drive resilience, growth, and sustainability simultaneously.

Resilient by design: Core elements of the RTES framework

The Research, Technology, and Economic Security (RTES) memo (1), formally adopted in November 2024, provides a comprehensive lens through which the DOE governs risk, value, and opportunity across its energy and research portfolio. It reflects a structured, harmonized, and nuanced approach to balancing open innovation with national security imperatives. Let us explore it in more detail.

Taxpayer-first risk discipline:

The framework places strong emphasis on transparency and accountability in the management of federal funding. One key example is the DOE’s policy change introduced in May 2025 to cap indirect cost reimbursements, with 10% for state and local governments and 15% for non-profits and for-profit institutions. These reforms are projected to save taxpayers nearly $935 million annually. (2)

Proportional risk mitigation:

RTES incorporates a tiered, stage-specific system to assess and mitigate risks across basic research, applied development, and full-scale deployment. By categorizing activities by technology readiness levels, the DOE applies proportionate risk controls to different funding instruments, including grants, loans, and cooperative agreements.

Multi-dimensional risk coverage:

From IP theft and supply chain dependencies to grid security and foreign influence, RTES covers a broad array of risk dimensions. The framework empowers program officers to implement tailored controls across the award lifecycle, informed by inputs from DOE’s Office of Intelligence and Counterintelligence. (3)

Enabling strategic collaboration:

Perhaps most critically, the DOE retains a commitment to open science and international collaboration. The framework recognizes that foreign partnerships and talent exchange are foundational to U.S. leadership in scientific discovery and innovation, so long as the risks are assessed and managed.

Turning policy into practice: Real-world deployments and case studies

The implications of the RTES framework are already visible across multiple operational domains. DOE program offices and National Labs are actively applying their principles to shape funding decisions, partnership eligibility, and technology investments. Let us introduce the main elements.

Supply chain resilience with the SCRL tool:

The Office of Manufacturing and Energy Supply Chains (MESC), in partnership with the National Laboratories, developed the Supply Chain Readiness Levels (SCRL) tool. (4) This analytics platform maps vulnerabilities in critical energy supply chains, especially dependencies on “covered nations”, and guides both federal and private sector investment priorities. The tool is being used to address supply risk in battery minerals, transformers, and grid components.

Geothermal innovation pilots:

In 2024, the DOE’s Geothermal Technologies Office announced over $30 million in funding for reservoir thermal energy storage (RTES) demonstration projects. (5) These pilots are testing new wellbore construction and high-temperature tools that can serve as baseload renewable power, offering grid flexibility while reducing emissions.

Scientific integrity and IP protection:

The RTES Office mandates complete disclosure of foreign affiliations and institutional partnerships in all grant and contract proposals. This has led to the rejection or revision of several projects where IP risk or foreign control could not be mitigated. These processes ensure the integrity of federal investments in high-impact R&D. (6)

Post-2025 energy dominance agenda:

Following the return of President Trump in 2025, the DOE issued sweeping secretarial orders to accelerate fossil fuel permitting, expand LNG exports, and reauthorize offshore oil and gas leases. Within 100 days, the DOE approved more new LNG export capacity than any nation outside the U.S. possesses, cementing the country’s status as the top oil and gas producer and exporter. (7)

Building a clean tech superpower: Renewable energy and economic growth

The Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) plays a central role in advancing clean energy innovation and commercialization. The EERE has streamlined its strategy around high-potential domains such as solar, wind, hydrogen, bioenergy, and sustainable mobility. Let us see how this is progressing.

Capitalizing on a $23 trillion market:

With the global renewable energy market projected to exceed $23 trillion by 2030, the U.S. is positioning itself to capture market share through smart policy and strategic public investment. Programs like the Loan Programs Office and clean energy tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act are enabling private capital leverage, creating manufacturing hubs, and generating clean jobs. (8)

Job creation and economic renewal:

Since 2021, clean energy projects have attracted more than $450 billion in private investment and created over 400,000 new jobs across sectors such as solar panel manufacturing, wind turbine logistics, battery storage, and electric vehicles. These gains have helped revitalize regional economies and support the U.S. manufacturing base. (9)

Health and household benefits:

Energy-efficient technologies are reducing household utility bills, improving indoor air quality, and cutting emissions that contribute to respiratory disease. DOE analysis suggests that combined benefits from clean energy deployment could generate tens of billions of dollars annually in public health savings. (10)

The road ahead: Future trends and strategic challenges

As the RTES framework matures and implementation scales, several trends and hurdles will define its long- term success. The use of analytical platforms like SCRL will be essential in dynamically tracking supply chain risks. Expanding these tools to cover emerging sectors such as hydrogen, Small Modular Reactors (SMRs), and rare earth magnets could help preempt future dependencies.

Furthermore, navigating the dual mandate of open science and secure innovation will remain challenging. The DOE must continue refining its evaluation criteria to allow for collaboration without compromising IP integrity or national competitiveness.

In terms of scaling deployment infrastructure, the U.S. will need trillions in grid upgrades, workforce training, and permitting reform to accommodate the full potential of renewable energy resources. This will require bipartisan policy support, private sector coordination, and ongoing EERE leadership.

Finally, geopolitical volatility persists. As tensions with China, Russia, and other state actors persist, the DOE’s RTES playbook must remain agile, balancing proactive risk mitigation with a forward-looking innovation strategy.

Final thoughts: Innovation secured and scaled

The U.S. Department of Energy’s RTES framework represents a paradigm shift in how public research dollars are governed. By weaving risk management into the core of its investment and oversight processes, DOE is charting a path toward resilience without sacrificing scientific openness. From grid security and clean energy leadership to economic development and international collaboration, the stakes of energy innovation have never been higher.

Through the synergy of EERE’s innovation programs and RTES’s accountability structures, the U.S. is laying the groundwork for a cleaner, safer, and more prosperous energy future. What remains now is to scale that vision with purpose, clarity, and enduring public trust.

One of the data centers proposed in Wisconsin is the $8 billion, 672-acre Vantage data center near Port Washington.","— Wisconsin has become a hotbed of data center activity over the past few years as some of the biggest names in the business rush to take advantage of accessible water, affordable electricity and the state’s cool climate.

At least 47 data centers are currently up and running or proposed in Wisconsin, according to Data Center Map. But experts say there could be more because some companies obscure their plans by entering into non-disclosure agreements and creating shell companies. The state’s vast supply of water, relatively affordable and available electricity, available land and colder climate to assist with cooling needs are attractive, experts add.

Past Wisconsin Tech Council President Tom Still said Wisconsin has been attracting a lot of data center activity lately because there’s a lot of available land, utilities have historically been reliable and the state’s construction industry is skilled and large enough to build the vast structures.

“I think that just finding the kinds of people who can work in these data centers is not as much of a challenge as it might be in other places, because there are computer science schools and tech colleges and other places that can help fill those jobs,” he added.

Wisconsin ranks behind other Midwestern states, though. Michigan has at least 57 data centers; Minnesota, 72; Indiana, 74; Iowa, 104; and Illinois, 222, according to DCM.

Almost half of those in Wisconsin, 21, are located in the Milwaukee area, with 11 in the Madison area and five in and around Kenosha. The rest are scattered around central Wisconsin, a DCM map shows.

DCM, founded in 2007, sources information from data center operators, end-users, through manual sourcing and more.

But many Wisconsinites, including prominent figures such as comedian Charlie Berens, have raised concerns about the environmental impact the data center boom will have. People are also concerned about rising utility costs associated with the increased demand on the power grid. A study by Carnegie Mellon University and North Carolina State University found data centers are expected to grow electricity bills by as much as 25% in certain regions of the country.

What is a data center, and where are they?

Technically, a data center can be any room, building or facility housing information technology infrastructure for building, running and developing applications and services, according to IBM. Under that definition, anything from an in-house server room in an office to the more than 7 million square-feet of space at The Citadel Campus in Reno, Nevada, could be considered a data center.

One of the data centers proposed in Wisconsin is the $8 billion, 672-acre Vantage data center near Port Washington. The Port Washington Common Council in August approved a development deal to move forward with the project’s Denver-based company. But the Vantage project will only be a small portion of the larger 1,900-acre data center campus that Cloverleaf Infrastructure is planning.

The Washington-based developer touts “delivering clean-powered, ready-to-build projects,” but hasn’t announced who else will occupy the campus.

Aside from the difficulty in figuring out exactly how many and where all the data centers and projects are, it’s difficult to quantify how large each project is. DCM reports out of the 10,844 data centers it’s tracking, only 3,836 include how much power in megawatts they use, and just 1,812 include total building size.

Another large data center investment, at least by dollar amount, comes from Microsoft’s more than $7 billion plan to build two data centers at the former Foxconn site in Racine County’s Mount Pleasant.

That plan, which includes at least 1,575 acres, doesn’t include the two other recent Microsoft data center plans in nearby Caledonia and Kenosha. Microsoft in January purchased 240 acres in Kenosha. The Caledonia Plan Commission Sept. 29 approved amending a land-use plan to rezone a 245-acre site, but less than two weeks later Microsoft announced it was backing out of its Caledonia effort, citing “community concerns.”

Microsoft also announced it still plans to find another site in southeastern Wisconsin instead of Caledonia.

Those projects, if the company’s Caledonia replacement is the same size, would bring Microsoft’s total footprint to more than 2,000 acres of data centers in southeastern Wisconsin, but they’re not the only company vying to occupy such large tracts of land.

Some data centers, like the Wells Building, owned by 1547 Critical Systems Realty, are much less conspicuous. The structure, a 15-story building and one of Milwaukee’s oldest skyscrapers, has occupied the same lot in the heart of downtown since 1901.

The 124-year-old structure has long been a communication hub and houses more than 30 carriers such as AT&T, Time Warner and Verizon. As communication technology has changed, so too has the building’s infrastructure. Under 1547’s ownership, the Wells Building now boasts up to 12 megawatts of building capacity power and 5,000 square feet of currently available data center space.

But that power capacity pales in comparison to large-scale data centers.

Environmental impact

Cloverleaf boasts it will be ready to deliver 3.5 gigawatts of power by 2030. That’s nearly 300 times as much as the Wells Building.

Microsoft’s first Mount Pleasant project and the Vantage project combined will require roughly 3.9 gigawatts of power. That’s not including Microsoft’s second Mount Pleasant project.

Clean Wisconsin in an analysis of the two projects found that’s enough power for roughly 4.3 million Wisconsin homes, more than the roughly 2.8 million housing units that currently exist in the state.

Amy Barrilleaux, Clean Wisconsin’s communications director, also said the speed at which companies are forging ahead makes it difficult to quantify the environmental impact they will have. But it’s clear there will be lasting effects, she added.

“It is going to push Wisconsin into a place where we’re not any closer to our clean energy goals, our climate goals, in a summer when we’ve had terrible smoke and severe flooding,” she said. “And so I think we’re seeing, just in terms of the sheer demand of energy that these data centers are going to need, we’re seeing how big that is.”

Water consumption is another major concern, Barrilleaux said.

Many past data center designs required continual water consumption, pumping it into cooling systems to reduce the heat of technology and then pumping it right back out of the facility again. Newer designs tend to use closed-loop designs, which are filled with water that circulates through the technology and then is cooled back down through large radiators, similar to a car’s radiator system.

But the closed-loop design is a trade-off, Barrilleuz said, adding “those systems are more energy intensive.”

“So it’s important to understand that 70% of water withdrawals in Wisconsin are for power generation in this state,” she said. “So we do not have a good understanding of what the true water impact is going to be in Wisconsin, because we don’t, for most of these projects, know how much energy they’re going to use. We don’t know how many gallons of water they’re going to use on site. We don’t know exactly where they’re going to be getting this water from.”

Dan Diorio, vice president of the Data Center Coalition, said water usage by data centers in Virginia, the nation’s data center hub, is sustainable, and the state’s regulations help ensure things stay that way. He also argued the industry “is committed to responsible water use, and it prioritizes efficient water practices and responsible management across operations and development.”

“Data centers are also actively investing in and deploying innovations, such as waterless cooling systems, closed-loop systems, and the use of recycled or reclaimed water,” Diorio said. “The industry also engages in water and watershed conservation and restoration projects in local communities and globally.”

Wisconsin Tech Council President Tom Still also said it’s worth keeping an eye on how much power and water data centers will consume, as well as the ability to meet the demands without generating a large amount of pollution.

— The Universities of Wisconsin and the state’s technical colleges would get $10 million per year to develop a student success and retention system under a newly circulated proposal.

LRB-4778, which all 15 Democratic senators and almost every Assembly Dem have signed onto, would provide the $10 million per year over the next two years.

“Academic and career advisors assist students to ensure they are retained year-over-year, and can complete a degree on-time,” the cosponsorship memo argues. “These resources are helpful to all students, but often impact the trajectory of first-generation, veteran, and returning students the most.”

— An education funding-related proposal would fully fund the Wisconsin GI Bill program.

LRB-4388 would change state law from sum certain to sum sufficient to ensure state funding covers all GI Bill expenses at public universities and technical colleges. The GI Bill covers 128 credits or eight semesters for veterans to attend state public universities and tech colleges.

The new proposal would first apply to students enrolled in the fall 2026 semester.

— In-home care franchise Right at Home plans to open a new unit in Eau Claire.

The announcement doesn’t include any more specifics on timing or location, but notes the area’s aging population and existing brand awareness due to 11 other Right at Home locations across the state makes Eau Claire a logical location.

“As we continue to grow, we’re prioritizing markets like Eau Claire that align with our mission and offer potential for meaningful impact,” Jennifer Chaney, senior vice president of franchise development and sales, said. “We’re looking for passionate entrepreneurs who want to make a difference in their communities while benefiting from a proven business model and an extensive support system.”

— UW-Madison and TAE Life Sciences are taking steps to launch the first of a new type of cancer treatment center.

The two announced they’ve signed a memorandum of understanding to move forward with the collaboration. As part of the agreement, UW-Madison would install an Alphabeam compact accelerator-based boron neutron capture therapy system developed by TAE, a biotech company that specializes in targeted radiation therapy for cancer care.

The therapy selectively targets cancer cells to minimize the impact on nearby healthy cells. With the Alphabeam technology, patients undergo a short, minimally invasive treatment in one or two sessions.

Dr. Nita Ahuja, vice chancellor for Medical Affairs at UW-Madison, said the effort “signifies our commitment to cancer clinical trials that will give critical access to experimental treatments for difficult-to-treat brain and head and neck cancers.”

“It is an outstanding opportunity to leverage the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health’s strengths in areas such as oncology, theranostics, particle therapy, clinical research, drug development and medical physics, aligned with our vision of healthy people and healthy communities,” she added.

But many Wisconsinites, including prominent figures such as comedian Charlie Berens, have raised concerns about the environmental impact the data center boom will have.
One of the data centers proposed in Wisconsin is the $8 billion, 672-acre Vantage data center near Port Washington.","Wisconsin has become a hotbed of data center activity over the past few years as some of the biggest names in the business rush to take advantage of accessible water, affordable electricity and the state’s cool climate.

At least 47 data centers are currently up and running or proposed in Wisconsin, according to Data Center Map. But experts say there could be more because some companies obscure their plans by entering into non-disclosure agreements and creating shell companies. The state’s vast supply of water, relatively affordable and available electricity, available land and colder climate to assist with cooling needs are attractive, experts add.

Wisconsin Tech Council President Tom Still said Wisconsin has been attracting a lot of data center activity lately because there’s a lot of available land, utilities have historically been reliable and the state’s construction industry is skilled and large enough to build the vast structures.

“I think that just finding the kinds of people who can work in these data centers is not as much of a challenge as it might be in other places, because there are computer science schools and tech colleges and other places that can help fill those jobs,” he added.

Wisconsin ranks behind other Midwestern states, though. Michigan has at least 57 data centers; Minnesota, 72; Indiana, 74; Iowa, 104; and Illinois, 222, according to DCM.

Almost half of those in Wisconsin, 21, are located in the Milwaukee area, with 11 in the Madison area and five in and around Kenosha. The rest are scattered around central Wisconsin, a DCM map shows.

DCM, founded in 2007, sources information from data center operators, end-users, through manual sourcing and more.

But many Wisconsinites, including prominent figures such as comedian Charlie Berens, have raised concerns about the environmental impact the data center boom will have. People are also concerned about rising utility costs associated with the increased demand on the power grid. A study by Carnegie Mellon University and North Carolina State University found data centers are expected to grow electricity bills by as much as 25% in certain regions of the country.

What is a data center, and where are they?

Technically, a data center can be any room, building or facility housing information technology infrastructure for building, running and developing applications and services, according to IBM. Under that definition, anything from an in-house server room in an office to the more than 7 million square-feet of space at The Citadel Campus in Reno, Nevada, could be considered a data center.

One of the data centers proposed in Wisconsin is the $8 billion, 672-acre Vantage data center near Port Washington. The Port Washington Common Council in August approved a development deal to move forward with the project’s Denver-based company. But the Vantage project will only be a small portion of the larger 1,900-acre data center campus that Cloverleaf Infrastructure is planning.

The Washington-based developer touts “delivering clean-powered, ready-to-build projects,” but hasn’t announced who else will occupy the campus.

Aside from the difficulty in figuring out exactly how many and where all the data centers and projects are, it’s difficult to quantify how large each project is. DCM reports out of the 10,844 data centers it’s tracking, only 3,836 include how much power in megawatts they use, and just 1,812 include total building size.

Another large data center investment, at least by dollar amount, comes from Microsoft’s more than $7 billion plan to build two data centers at the former Foxconn site in Racine County’s Mount Pleasant.

That plan, which includes at least 1,575 acres, doesn’t include the two other recent Microsoft data center plans in nearby Caledonia and Kenosha. Microsoft in January purchased 240 acres in Kenosha. The Caledonia Plan Commission Sept. 29 approved amending a land-use plan to rezone a 245-acre site, but less than two weeks later Microsoft announced it was backing out of its Caledonia effort, citing “community concerns.”

Microsoft also announced it still plans to find another site in southeastern Wisconsin instead of Caledonia.

Those projects, if the company’s Caledonia replacement is the same size, would bring Microsoft’s total footprint to more than 2,000 acres of data centers in southeastern Wisconsin, but they’re not the only company vying to occupy such large tracts of land.

Some data centers, like the Wells Building, owned by 1547 Critical Systems Realty, are much less conspicuous. The structure, a 15-story building and one of Milwaukee’s oldest skyscrapers, has occupied the same lot in the heart of downtown since 1901.

The 124-year-old structure has long been a communication hub and houses more than 30 carriers such as AT&T, Time Warner and Verizon. As communication technology has changed, so too has the building’s infrastructure. Under 1547’s ownership, the Wells Building now boasts up to 12 megawatts of building capacity power and 5,000 square feet of currently available data center space.

But that power capacity pales in comparison to large-scale data centers.

Environmental impact

Cloverleaf boasts it will be ready to deliver 3.5 gigawatts of power by 2030. That’s nearly 300 times as much as the Wells Building.

Microsoft’s first Mount Pleasant project and the Vantage project combined will require roughly 3.9 gigawatts of power. That’s not including Microsoft’s second Mount Pleasant project.

Clean Wisconsin in an analysis of the two projects found that’s enough power for roughly 4.3 million Wisconsin homes, more than the roughly 2.8 million housing units that currently exist in the state.

Amy Barrilleaux, Clean Wisconsin’s communications director, also said the speed at which companies are forging ahead makes it difficult to quantify the environmental impact they will have. But it’s clear there will be lasting effects, she added.

“It is going to push Wisconsin into a place where we’re not any closer to our clean energy goals, our climate goals, in a summer when we’ve had terrible smoke and severe flooding,” she said. “And so I think we’re seeing, just in terms of the sheer demand of energy that these data centers are going to need, we’re seeing how big that is.”

Water consumption is another major concern, Barrilleaux said.

Many past data center designs required continual water consumption, pumping it into cooling systems to reduce the heat of technology and then pumping it right back out of the facility again. Newer designs tend to use closed-loop designs, which are filled with water that circulates through the technology and then is cooled back down through large radiators, similar to a car’s radiator system.

But the closed-loop design is a trade-off, Barrilleuz said, adding “those systems are more energy intensive.”

“So it’s important to understand that 70% of water withdrawals in Wisconsin are for power generation in this state,” she said. “So we do not have a good understanding of what the true water impact is going to be in Wisconsin, because we don’t, for most of these projects, know how much energy they’re going to use. We don’t know how many gallons of water they’re going to use on site. We don’t know exactly where they’re going to be getting this water from.”

Dan Diorio, vice president of the Data Center Coalition, said water usage by data centers in Virginia, the nation’s data center hub, is sustainable, and the state’s regulations help ensure things stay that way. He also argued the industry “is committed to responsible water use, and it prioritizes efficient water practices and responsible management across operations and development.”

“Data centers are also actively investing in and deploying innovations, such as waterless cooling systems, closed-loop systems, and the use of recycled or reclaimed water,” Diorio said. “The industry also engages in water and watershed conservation and restoration projects in local communities and globally.”

Wisconsin Tech Council President Tom Still also said it’s worth keeping an eye on how much power and water data centers will consume, as well as the ability to meet the demands without generating a large amount of pollution.",https://www.wisbusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/1000015938.png,N,,2025-10-13 09:09:45.471358

Sizewell C, which will be built near Leiston in Suffolk, has agreed a six-year supply contract with Urenco - and a long-term fuel fabrication contract with Framatome.

The former will make natural uranium suitable for use at the power plant, before the latter turns it into pellets, which then form fuel assemblies for use inside its reactors.

Those behind the deal predict it will support and create thousands of jobs within the industry and minimise the plant's reliance on fuel imports.

Julia Pyke and Nigel Cann, joint managing directors of Sizewell C, said: ""These two contracts represent a major moment for Sizewell C and for energy security in the UK.

""The fuel that will go in our reactors will be low carbon and predominantly sourced from the UK, produced by skilled British workers.

""This is what we mean by doing infrastructure differently – and it puts the UK's energy security and our nuclear supply chain in a much stronger place.""

Sizewell C, which will cost £38bn to build, will supply electricity to the equivalent of six million homes for at least 60 years once it is operational, predicted to be in the 2030s.

Those behind the development say the project will directly support 10,000 jobs and thousands more in the supply chain, and create 1,500 apprenticeships.

Some of those include around 1,000 existing jobs at Urenco's enrichment site at Capenhurst, near Chester.

Sizewell's deal with Framatome, meanwhile, will initially see the fuel fabricated at its factory in Romans, France, until its new UK facility is built, creating yet more jobs.

“At this time, we have not been made aware of any changes to the announced DOE grants for our Alliant Energy projects,” Tomlinson said.
The federal grants accounted for about one-third of the total planned investment for each project.
WRTP was awarded a $1.5 million grant for training in skills related to transportation electrification.","More than $130 million in Wisconsin clean energy-related projects are at risk as the Trump administration moves to cut up to $24 billion in projects originally approved by the Biden administration.

The projects are on a list that covers three groups of cuts proposed in May, on Oct. 2 and this past week. The online news outlet Semafor reported the third set of proposed cuts, which alone totals $12 billion, on Tuesday, Oct. 7, and published a link to a list that covers all three groups.

“However, it’s not clear whether, or when, the full list of cancellations will be enacted, or if President Donald Trump is instead looking to use them as leverage in negotiations over the [federal government] shutdown,” Semafor reported.

The Wisconsin grants on the list are a mix of projects that help boost energy efficiency, including supporting the expansion of energy storage battery systems. One potential casualty is more than $1 million to prepare young people to enter apprenticeships in the skilled trades.

Clean energy holds the promise of addressing air pollution and climate change as well as revitalizing the state’s industrial base, said John Imes, director of the Wisconsin Environmental Initiative (WEI), a nonprofit that advocates policies benefiting the environment and the economy.

“These are all win-win that all of us want regardless of our political affiliation,” Imes told the Wisconsin Examiner. “This is all bottom-line stuff.”

Rolling back projects that enhance cleaner and more efficient use of energy will likely increase the cost of energy, Imes said.

“It means higher electric bills, higher energy bills, fewer choices and lost jobs,” he said. “We’re going to lose momentum.”

Battery power and rural grid upgrade

The two largest Wisconsin projects on the Department of Energy list of targets involve one company, Alliant Energy. They account for more than half of the Wisconsin funds targeted for cancellation.

The projects are being undertaken by Alliant’s Wisconsin Power & Light unit. They include a $50 million grant for upgrading the rural electrical grid and $30 million for a power storage system using a technology based on carbon dioxide this is to be built near Portage, Wisconsin.

“We understand the Administration and Department of Energy (DOE) are working through their budgets and have notified some businesses of changes to grant announcements,” said Cindy Tomlinson, Alliant senior manager for communications, in an email message last week.

“At this time, we have not been made aware of any changes to the announced DOE grants for our Alliant Energy projects,” Tomlinson said. “We are optimistic the value and viability of these projects is clear and that they will remain fully funded. These projects deliver economic and customer benefits.”

The electrical grid upgrade project received a conditional commitment from the energy department in December, but a final award agreement hasn’t been executed, Tomlinson said, and no federal funds have been received or spent.

The federal grants accounted for about one-third of the total planned investment for each project. If the grid upgrade grant is canceled, the project is still expected to go forward, Tomlinson said, “however at a slower, more gradual pace than the fast, concentrated fashion outlined in our grant application.”

Other potentially affected grants include $28.7 million for Johnson Controls, based in the Milwaukee suburb of Glendale, to support the company in its expansion of heat pump manufacturing.

The grant’s total value was $33 million at the time it was awarded to the company. According to USAspending.gov, a federal site that tracks the status of federal outlays, the business has received $4.4 million of the total.

Johnson Controls announced the grant in November 2023, part of an investment to scale up heat pump manufacturing at plants in Texas, Kansas and Pennsylvania and increase production by 200%, the company said at the time.

The company did not respond to inquiries Thursday and Friday by email and by telephone about the status of the grant or its planned heat pump manufacturing expansion.

Energy efficiency and innovation

Another Wisconsin recipient with grants on the list that are slated for elimination is Slipstream, a Madison-based nonprofit that provides consulting services on energy efficiency and innovation.

“We’re trying to make our energy systems more efficient and better so everybody’s paying less for energy,” said Scott Hackel, Slipstream’s vice president for research.

Hackel said Slipstream is working with other organizations on the list of targeted projects, and some of those organizations have been notified of grant terminations.

Slipstream also has two direct grants on the list, but has not received any notification that those grants are being terminated, Hackel said.

Slipstream had been awarded $5.2 million for work on equipping buildings with technology that enables them to automatically manage their power demand — reducing the building’s electrical load when demand on the grid is high and amping up the load when broader demand eases.

The organization is in the middle of a project implementing demand management technology in a group of buildings. The information gained from that test could be used to develop incentive programs for building owners to adopt that kind of technology, Hackel said.

If that gets cut off before it’s finished, other buildings in Wisconsin “would not have this example to look to,” he said.

A second grant awarded to the organization, $4 million, is to be used to train inspectors, building designers and others in how to effectively comply with and make the best use of building codes, particularly energy codes.

“Everything we’re doing is trying to make buildings and homes more affordable to live in with lower utility bills,” Hackel said. “If we’re not able to do that, that’s also a cost to people in Wisconsin.”

Two Universities of Wisconsin grants, one for $10 million and the other for $2.9 million, are on the list. Both involve projects to test technology innovations, according to the federal grant information documents.

‘Electric city’ upgrades and a job-training program

A grant for the city of Kaukauna, Wisconsin, to install battery storage and make related electrical grid upgrades is also on the list. The original grant totaled $3 million, and so far $59,362 has been paid out, according to USAspending.gov, leaving $2.95 million that could be canceled.

The storage system is to bolster Kaukauna’s hydroelectric power generation operation, which dates to 1913 and led to the community’s adoption of “Electric City” as its nickname.

“Collateral damage from the Trump administration’s remarkably poor governance record continues to collect, this time in Kaukauna,” said Outagamie County Executive Tom Nelson. “I can’t think of something more insulting than making the electric grid of a place known as ‘Electric City’ less safe or efficient.”

Also on the list is the Wisconsin Regional Training Partnership, a Milwaukee nonprofit that provides training and certification to prepare people to enter apprenticeships in the skilled trades. WRTP was awarded a $1.5 million grant for training in skills related to transportation electrification. So far $112,470 has been paid out.

Dan Bukiewicz, head of the Milwaukee Building Trades Council and co-chair of the WRTP board of directors, said that the board hasn’t been notified that its grant might be at risk of being taken away by the Trump administration.

“I won’t say we’re surprised,” however, Bukiewicz said. “They’re just trying to roll back a lot of the green energy and infrastructure [investments]. … It’s trying to make time stand still, and it just won’t if the United States is going to compete globally.”

WRTP students typically come from underserved communities and are the most in need, Bukiewicz said. The program’s training emphasizes job safety, introduces students to the construction industry, equips them with basic skills that an apprenticeship will build on, and acquaints them with how the industry and the technology are changing and where they might find a place that suits them.

If the federal grant is pulled, “these dollars are irreplaceable,” Bukiewicz said. “It’s not just taking money away and eliminating classes. It’s eliminating opportunities and a chance for generational change for people who really need it.”",https://wisconsinexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Power-lines___Scott-Olson-Getty-2048x1366.jpg,N,,2025-10-13 09:08:05.670951

The company also faces legal challenges from the California Coastal Commission, environmental groups and even its own investors.
Although the company reports that pipeline repairs are complete, the lines have not yet been approved for restart by state regulators.
However, the company says it continues to seek approvals to restart the pipelines from the California Office of the State Fire Marshal.
Sable Offshore Corp. is no different.”","When a Texas oil company first announced controversial plans to reactivate three drilling rigs off the coast of Santa Barbara County, investor presentations boasted that the venture had “massive resource potential” and was “primed for cash flow generation.”

But now, less than two years later, mounting legal setbacks and regulatory issues are casting increasing doubt on the project’s future.

Most recently, the California attorney general filed suit against Houston-based Sable Offshore Corp., accusing it of repeatedly putting “profits over environmental protections.” The lawsuit, filed last week in Santa Barbara County Superor Court, accuses Sable of continually failing to follow state laws and regulations intended to protect water resources.

Sable, the lawsuit claims, “was at best misinformed, incompetent and incorrect” when it came to understanding and adhering to the California Water Code. “At worst, Sable was simply bamboozling the Regional Water Board to meet a critical deadline,” according to the lawsuit.

The action comes less than a month after the Santa Barbara County district attorney’s office filed criminal charges against the company, accusing it of knowingly violating state environmental laws while working on repairs to oil pipelines that have sat idle since a major spill in 2015.

The company also faces legal challenges from the California Coastal Commission, environmental groups and even its own investors.

These developments now threaten the company’s ability to push forward on what has become an increasingly expensive and complicated project, according to some experts.

Clark Williams-Derry, an analyst for the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, said there are still ways Sable could get off the ground and begin oil sales, but the repeated setbacks have become what he called “cumulative risk” for investors, who are key to funding the restart.

“Sable is at risk of burning through its cash, and lenders are going to have to make a decision about whether or not this is a good investment,” Williams-Derry said. Ongoing pushback from the public, the state and in lawsuits makes that increasingly a hard argument to make, he said.

Sable, however, said it remains steadfast in its goal of reactivating the Santa Ynez Unit — a complex of three offshore platforms, onshore processing facilities and connecting pipelines. The unit was shuttered by a different company a decade ago after a corroded section of pipeline ruptured near Refugio State Beach, creating one of the state’s worst oil spills.

The company denies that it has broken any laws and insists that it has followed all necessary regulations. Recently, however, company officials have promoted a new restart plan that could avoid California oversight.

Company officials say the new plan would keep the project entirely within federal waters — pivoting away from using the contentious pipelines and from what company officials called California’s “crumbling energy complex.”

Jim Flores, the company’s chief executive, said Sable is working with the Trump administration’s National Energy Dominance Council on the plan to use an offshore storage and treatment vessel to transport crude from its offshore wells instead of the pipeline system. Although the company reports that pipeline repairs are complete, the lines have not yet been approved for restart by state regulators.

“California has to make a decision soon on the pipeline before Sable signs an agreement for the [offshore vessel] and goes all in on the offshore federal-only option,” Flores said in a statement.

The company acknowledges that transporting oil by ship instead of pipeline would dramatically extend the company’s timeline and increase its costs. In a June Securities and Exchange Commission report, Sable said there was “substantial doubt ... about the company’s ability to continue,” given ongoing negative cash flow and stalled regulatory approvals.

However, the company says it continues to seek approvals to restart the pipelines from the California Office of the State Fire Marshal.

The state fire marshal has said the plans remain under review, but the office has made clear that the pipelines will be approved for operation only “once all compliance and safety requirements, including ... approvals from other state, federal and local agencies, are met.”

Deborah Sivas, a professor of environmental law at Stanford’s Law School, said it’s getting harder to see a successful path forward for Sable.

“It’s pretty rare that an entity would have all these agencies lined up concerned about their impacts,” Sivas said of state regulators. “These agencies don’t very lightly go to litigation or enforcement actions. ... and the public is strongly against offshore drilling. So those are a whole bunch of reasons that I think are going to be hard obstacles for that company.”

But even if Sable can pivot to federal-only oversight under a friendly Trump administration, Williams-Derry said there’s no clear-cut path.

“This is an environment where some of the best, most profitable oil companies in the U.S. have cut drilling this year because profits are too low,” Williams-Derry said. Sable has enough money in the bank right now to have a “little bit of running room,” he said, “...but you can imagine that [investors] are going to start running out of patience.”

The new lawsuit filed by the California attorney general lays out a year’s worth of instances in which Sable either ignored or defied the California Water Code during the firm’s pipeline repair work. The attorney general’s office called Sable’s evasion of regulatory oversight “egregious,” warranting “substantial penalties.”

It’s not immediately clear how much will be demanded, but violations of the California Water Code are subject to a civil liability of up to $5,000 for each day a violation occurs.

Despite repeated reminders and warnings from the California Regional Water Quality Control Board, Central Coast region, Sable did not comply with the water code, preventing the board “from assuring best management practices ... to avoid, minimize and mitigate impacts to water quality,” the lawsuit said.

“No corporation should gain a business advantage by ignoring the law and harming the environment,” Jane Gray, chair of the Central Coast Water Board, said in a statement. “Entities that discharge waste are required to obtain permits from the state to protect water quality. Sable Offshore Corp. is no different.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0fdaa47/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1575+0+213/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe1%2Fd1%2F6e1a5a8847218fc2fa84bcfd9def%2F1501692-me-coastal-commission-hearing-27.jpg,N,,2025-10-13 09:08:54.465514

Hitachi Energy’s 1100 kV GIS will provide strong support to achieve these objectives.

“China's systematic deployment in the UHV grid sector has laid a solid foundation for renewable energy development and secure power supply. We are honored to support the expansion of Nanchang 1000 kV UHV substation — a major milestone for Hitachi Energy's GIS technology in the world's highest-voltage networks,” said James Zhao, Executive Vice President and Region head of Greater China, Hitachi Energy. “Leveraging our leading technology, we remain committed to advancing China's UHV strategy and China's low-carbon energy transition.”

Hitachi Energy’s 1100 kV GIS technology is engineered for insulation coordination. It offers the performance and reliability required by duties and reliability requirements of China’s 1000 kV AC UHV system, combining a compact layout with high mechanical endurance and comprehensive lifecycle services. Manufacturing will take place at Hitachi Energy’s high-voltage switchgear facility in Xiamen, China.

It’s time to reform permitting and start building again in Pennsylvania and across America.","We all know the value of affordable and reliable energy. From powering homes and businesses to supporting hundreds of thousands of good jobs for Pennsylvanians, energy means jobs, growth and opportunity. But demand for energy is surging fast.

America’s electricity demand is projected to increase 35 to 50 percent by 2040, driven in large part by new AI data centers.

In the PJM Interconnection, which includes Pennsylvania, 95 percent of new power demand through 2030 is expected to come from data centers, further straining a system that’s slow to bring new power sources online. Replacing retiring power sources, particularly reliable baseload power like natural gas, is essential to powering AI and keeping the lights on for American families.

A broken federal permitting system

The rapid rise of technology and the race for America’s future brings new urgency to fixing a broken, inefficient permitting system where projects are often stuck in red tape and buried in endless reviews, thus blocking the critical infrastructure needed to keep pace with demand.

Infrastructure project of all kinds – pipelines, power plants, transmission lines – even roads and bridges – face a myriad of federal approvals under a maze of outdated laws and regulations. Opponents regularly weaponize statutes like the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and the Clean Water Act (CWA) to block development at every stage of permitting.

In natural gas-rich Pennsylvania and the Appalachia region, more takeaway capacity, including pipelines, is needed to move energy from the drilling field to consumers.

Major pipelines in the region, including PennEast, Constitution and Atlantic Coast, were cancelled after years of permitting delays and court challenges.

After nearly six years of lawsuits and delays, it took an act of Congress to help finish the 303-mile Mountain Valley Pipeline, which links Appalachian basin natural gas to markets in the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast.

When infrastructure lags behind demand, supply tightens. Building new infrastructure helps energy flow faster to consumers and could help keep costs affordable.

While the Trump administration has taken steps to stop harmful mandates and restrictive energy policies to help bolster American energy dominance, congressional action on permitting reform is urgently needed to unlock America’s potential and get back to building. Enacting commonsense deadlines and predictable permitting processes can help ensure projects are built in years, not decades.

Three key areas must be addressed: 1) set deadlines and enforce them, 2) stop lawsuits and start building and 3) enforce targeted reviews and swift decisions.

Pennsylvania stands ready to build

Energy-rich Pennsylvania can benefit from permitting reform. Sitting atop the Marcellus shale, the largest natural gas formation in the U.S., Pennsylvania is the second-largest natural gas producer in America.

Pennsylvania has the natural resources and skilled workforce to advance U.S. energy dominance and build a stronger economy. Permitting reform can help unleash Pennsylvania energy to support innovation while creating good jobs and helping to keep energy costs affordable for consumers.

Without permit reform, Pennsylvanians could face energy shortages, much like they do in California and New England, where policy roadblocks restrict energy access and infrastructure projects.

Pennsylvanians shouldn’t have to pay the price for permitting delays, with fewer reliable energy options, because Washington can’t fix a broken permitting system. This doesn’t mean cutting corners on safety or the environment – it means using common sense, establishing clear deadlines and keeping critical projects moving forward – not trapped in red tape and litigation.

Congress must act on durable reforms that help ensure Americans have access to affordable, reliable and secure energy for decades to come while helping to power U.S. technology and innovation.

It’s time to reform permitting and start building again in Pennsylvania and across America.
