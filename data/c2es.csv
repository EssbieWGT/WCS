YAHD SIGNS AND BUMPAH STICKAHS SENATE SPECIAL — State Rep. Rodney Elliot will run for the Senate seat previously held by late state Sen. Edward Kennedy.","BANK ON IT — While we were focused on the nascent Senate race, the latest Federal Election Commission filing deadline came and went.

THE SENATE SHOWDOWN — Sen. Ed Markey posted one of his biggest quarters this cycle, raising $755,741 from July through September as reports of a potential primary challenge ramped up. That’s more than twice Moulton’s $300,279 haul in the third quarter.

Markey also ended September with $2,662,200 on hand, more than Moulton’s $2,125,110.

But Moulton has raised another $500,000 since announcing his Senate bid, his campaign announced over the weekend (We won’t be able to check the totals until the fourth quarter reporters are out early next year.).

HIGHS AND LOWS — Markey raised the most of any member of the delegation, but Rep. Jake Auchincloss is sitting on a lot more money than everyone else. He ended the three-month period with more than $6.4 million in the bank. Elizabeth Warren had the next most cash on hand (just under $4 million). Rep. Stephen Lynch raised the least of any incumbent, with just $60,617. Meanwhile …

THE CHALLENGERS — … his challenger, Patrick Roath, an attorney from Jamaica Plain, pulled in about $143,000. Lynch still has more money in the bank ($1,056,625 to Roath’s $261,369).

Jeromie Whalen, the former Northampton teacher who is running against Rep. Richard Neal, raised $55,394 since getting in the race in August and ended the period with $15,743 in the bank. Neal had a significant advantage there, raising $216,461 and ending the quarter with $3,973,431 in his campaign coffers.

GOOD MONDAY MORNING, MASSACHUSETTS. In other fundraising news …

FIRST IN PLAYBOOK — Dan Koh, a former Biden White House official and longtime aide to former Boston Mayor Marty Walsh, raised more than $800,000 in the first 24 hours of his congressional campaign launch, an amount he says is the largest first-day haul for any Democratic campaign this cycle.

That includes $50,000 of his own cash Koh is putting into the race. That money (which Koh says is a donation, not a loan) will go toward covering health care premiums for campaign staff.

“I know how hard it is to be a staffer, and I know how hard it is to work on a campaign. And on top of that, I don’t want my staff to be worried about how they’re going to pay their medical bills when they get sick,” Koh told Playbook.

Koh said he was “incredibly humbled” by the early fundraising haul. “I’m just grateful to the hard-working people who supported my campaign because they want a representative who will fight for working people, protect democracy and make life more affordable,” he said.

Koh raised some serious cash during his previous run for Congress in Massachusetts’ Third District, though his campaign also earned headlines for how much of that money was flowing from donors outside the district. Koh ended up coming in a close second in that race to Rep. Lori Trahan. His home in Andover ended up in the Sixth District after lawmakers drew new congressional maps in 2021.

TODAY — Gov. Maura Healey has no public events. Lt. Gov. Kim Driscoll attends the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce’s City to City conference in Philadelphia. Auditor Diana DiZoglio is the keynote speaker at the Merrimack Valley Chamber of Commerce Women in Business Conference at noon in Haverhill.

YAHD SIGNS AND BUMPAH STICKAHS

SENATE SPECIAL — State Rep. Rodney Elliot will run for the Senate seat previously held by late state Sen. Edward Kennedy.

“This announcement comes with heartfelt deference to both Senator Kennedy and his family upon his passing,” Elliott said in announcing his bid for the seat that covers Lowell, Dracut, Dunstable, Pepperell and Tyngsboro. “As a member of the House of Representatives and previously as a City Councilor, I had the distinct honor of working closely with Senator Kennedy, and have long respected his dedication and passion for serving both Lowell and the First Middlesex District.”

The Senate has yet to officially set the date for the special election to fill the seat Kennedy held until his death earlier this month.

MONEY WARS — Rep. Seth Moulton’s announcement that he won’t take money from the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (commonly known as AIPAC), isn’t sitting well with the organization. AIPAC took aim at Moulton in a fundraising missive last week, accusing Moulton of “capitulating to extremes rather than standing on conviction.”

DATELINE BEACON HILL

— Massachusetts gambling regulators look to rein in VIP programs by sports betting apps by Patrick Madden, WBUR: “The Massachusetts Gaming Commission is eyeing regulations for VIP programs used by online sports betting companies that offer perks to frequent bettors. VIP or loyalty programs at companies like DraftKings and FanDuel have come under increasing scrutiny over concerns they target gamblers who are losing money and encourage them to keep playing by rewarding them with trips, sports tickets or bet credits.”

— Education council releases draft of new state graduation standard after overturn of MCAS by Grace Zokovitch, Boston Herald: “Proposed regulations for a new graduation standard could see students across Massachusetts taking “end of course assessments” designed and administered by the state, according to a new draft released nearly a year after voters overturned the statewide MCAS testing graduation requirement. The preliminary draft released by state education officials lays out what standards Massachusetts high school students may be required to meet to graduate, replacing the former MCAS standardized testing requirement.”

IN ALIGNMENT — Massachusetts Republican gubernatorial hopeful Brian Shortsleeve has plenty of criticism for Gov. Maura Healey. But there’s one policy area where Shortsleeve and Healey overlap (at least a little): housing.

Shortsleeve wants to free up state-owned land for housing development in an effort to address the state’s housing crisis, he said during an interview on WCVB’s “On the Record” that aired Sunday.

“The state owns 100,000 acres of land around metro Boston in areas where the community would be happy to have you build,” he said, pointing to a program then-Gov. Charlie Baker launched in 2015.

If that sounds familiar, it’s because Healey made a similar move this summer. Her administration opened up 450 acres of state-owned land to developers who claim it could mean up to 3,500 new homes in the area of a former hospital campus, an abandoned school and an old state prison.

FROM THE HUB

DRAWING A CROWD — Boston’s “No Kings” protest caught social media attention for the aerial view of its crowd.

But for #mapoli watchers, it was also the first time Sen. Ed Markey and Rep. Seth Moulton took the stage at the same event since Moulton announced he would challenge Markey for his Senate seat.

Markey appeared, draped in a transgender flag (a gift from a transgender high school student who attended the event, according to Markey’s campaign), a not-so-subtle reminder of comments Moulton made about transgender athletes to The New York Times in the wake of the 2024 election.

Some in the crowd still took issue with those remarks. Moulton’s speech was greeted with some booing, “and expletives from some rallygoers,” per MassLive. More on the protests in Quincy, Hyannis, Worcester, the Berkshires and the South Coast.

The Race for City Hall

— Incorrect email address led to New Bedford City Council candidate’s tardy campaign filing by Frank Mulligan, The Standard-Times: “City Council candidate Christopher Cotter has filed a required campaign financial document with the state that had been due last month, a lapse he had been warned could subject him to $25-per-day fines. However, he said his lack of response to the warnings was unintentional. Cotter stated in an Oct. 16 communication to the state Office of Campaign and Political Finance that the lapse had been due to an incorrect email address.”

— Attleboro mayoral write-in candidate incorrectly claims police charge against him is a rumor by Rhianwen Watkins, The Sun Chronicle: “Write-in mayoral candidate John Robinson is claiming a news article published last week in The Sun Chronicle about him being charged with threatening to assault a school committee member was based on rumor and that no formal charges have been filed against him. The claim was debunked by Police Chief Kyle Heagney. Heagney confirmed with The Sun Chronicle Sunday that a charge has indeed been filed against Robinson in Attleboro District Court and that Robinson will be summonsed at a date to be determined by the court.”

WHAT'S ON CAMPBELL'S DOCKET

— AGs sue Trump EPA over solar energy program by Christian M. Wade, The Eagle-Tribune: “Attorney General Andrea Campbell has joined about two dozen other Democrats in suing the Trump administration over its decision to pull the plug on a $7 billion solar energy program for low-income households. The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Washington, alleges that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency violated federal law and the Administrative Procedures Act when it terminated the Solar for All program, approved by Congress in 2023 as part of the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act.”

PLANES, TRAINS AND AUTOMOBILES

— Feds freeze funding for Cape Cod’s aging bridges due to government shutdown by Tonya Alanez, The Boston Globe: “Hundreds of millions in federal funding to help pay for the replacement of two aging bridges that carry traffic on and off Cape Cod suddenly appears to be in flux. The Trump administration last week announced a pause in $11 billion in US Army Corps of Engineers projects in Democratic cities, including Boston, due to the government shutdown. Governor Maura Healey and other Massachusetts lawmakers immediately expressed concern about the federal money, $350 million for the Sagamore Bridge and $250 million for the Bourne Bridge, which was earmarked in the spring of 2024 for the replacement projects.”

FROM THE DELEGATION

— Neal: It’s up to Trump, and the pressure of rising health insurance costs, to end the shutdown by Jim Kinney, The Springfield Republican: “Democrats are firm in their resolve to protect tax credits in the Affordable Care Act as the government shutdown heads toward its fourth week. U.S. Rep. Richard E. Neal said higher bills for health insurance — costs the tax credits are meant to counteract for working Americans making too much money for Medicaid —that will end the impasse.”

THE LOCAL ANGLE

— Tens of thousands of Massachusetts federal workers face uncertainty amid government shutdown by Anjali Huynh, Katie Johnston, Laura Crimaldi and Jason Laughlin, The Boston Globe: “As congressional Democrats and Republicans remain locked in a standoff to reopen the government, federal workers in Massachusetts are facing chaos and confusion over whether they will get paid, or have jobs to return to if they are furloughed. More than half of Massachusetts’ estimated 46,000 federal employees — about 25,000 — have faced furloughs or are working without pay because of the shutdown, according to the American Federation of Government Employees, or AFGE, a union of federal workers. That number is part of a bleak national picture, in which federal workers say they’re acutely feeling the shutdown’s effects as many have now missed paychecks since the shutdown began Oct. 1.”

— Quincy ordered to pay $16 million to retirement pension fund. It could raise taxes by Peter Blandino, The Patriot Ledger: “The expected tax hike for Quincy property owners next year may be higher than previously anticipated. The $456 million fiscal 2026 budget is an 8.6% increase over the previous year, largely due to an expected $20 million jump in debt service tied to the city’s 2021 pension obligation bond. Debt service makes up almost 20% of the city’s budget. The bond is essentially a fixed-rate $475 million loan Quincy took out to fund the pensions of retired city workers fully by 2040, as mandated by the state. But Quincy also has another new $16 million bill to pay. The money is due to be paid into Quincy’s retirement system. The budget, proposed by Mayor Tom Koch and passed unanimously by city council, allocates nothing for it.”

The circulating list has angered Democrats and prompted several Republicans to pressure DOE to save projects in their states.","The Department of Energy has canceled more than $700 million in battery and manufacturing awards, advancing the Trump administration’s efforts to nix Biden-era energy projects.

DOE told POLITICO’s E&E News on Friday that it canceled the five grants during the second week of October. The cuts appear to be the first that DOE has confirmed from a list of targeted projects circulating among lobbyists. Until now, it was unclear if DOE planned to move forward with scrapping any of the more than $200 billion in awards on the list.

The $700 million covers grants that the Biden administration awarded to battery companies Ascend Elements, American Battery Technology Co., Anovion and ICL Specialty Products, as well as a glass manufacturer LuxWall, according to DOE.

The projects “had missed milestones, and it was determined they did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs, were not economically viable, and would not provide a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars,” DOE spokesperson Ben Dietderich said in a statement. He did not specify the milestones that DOE says the projects missed.

The cancellations are some of the largest to date of advanced battery manufacturing projects, affecting plans to build landmark plants in red states like Kentucky and Missouri. That distinguishes them from DOE’s initial tranche of $7.56 billion in terminations, which mainly affected projects in states won by former Vice President Kamala Harris in last year’s presidential election.

Those earlier cancellations included less than $175 million in funding cuts from DOE’s Manufacturing and Energy Supply Chains Office (MESC) . The newly canceled funding totals approximately $718 million from the same office, affecting initiatives to manufacture components for electric vehicles and grid batteries.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright and other Trump administration officials have been critical of federal funding of electric vehicles and renewables, which often work in tandem with batteries.

Wright has been leading a broad review of projects, following criteria outlined in a May memo. He defended funding cuts this month, saying that projects “have cancellation clauses.”

“If they’re not in the interest of the taxpayers, if they’re not a good expenditure of the money, you always have the ability to cancel these projects,” he said.

Democrats charge that DOE’s actions are illegal and will hurt the economy and slash jobs. Last week, 37 Democratic and independent senators said in a letter to Wright that “the illegality of your cancellations is the only thing as indisputable as the harm your cancellations will wreak.”

The department “must expend these funds and faithfully execute the law, including many programs that have strict requirements for the timing of fund expenditure, purposes, and contractual expectations,” the lawmakers said.

From Alabama to Michigan

The nixed grants affect projects backed by the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law.

The $197.3 million award to ICL Specialty Products was slated to help build a plant in St. Louis producing 30,000 metric tons annually of lithium-ion phosphate powder for the battery industry. The company did not respond to request for comment but said in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing last week that it was “reviewing DOE’s announcement and the implications thereof.”

When the project was announced, ICL projected it would create 120 permanent positions and more than 800 construction jobs.

The largest canceled award — $316 million to Ascend Elements — was intended to support the manufacture of components from recycled electric vehicle batteries at a planned $1 billion plant in Hopkinsville, Kentucky. The battery components would compete with supply that now comes primarily from China, the company said.

“The DOE’s decision regarding the grant doesn’t change our trajectory. We’re moving forward,” Linh Austin, president and CEO of the company, said last Thursday to E&E News.

“Our funding path is diversified well beyond DOE. We are replacing the remaining unused portion of the DOE grant with a mix of other sources of funding available to the company including equity, project finance, municipal bonds, and other forms of debt.”

According to the Massachusetts-based company, $206 million of the DOE award had been disbursed, so the cancellation would affect the roughly remaining $100 million.

The $57.7 million grant to American Battery Technology Co. was meant to support construction of a Nevada plant to produce lithium hydroxide for batteries.

The company said it received a notice from DOE on Oct. 9 about the axed funding, which it plans to appeal, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. It said there was roughly $52 million remaining to be disbursed from DOE, although the company said it has raised the same amount in public markets.

“Regardless of the outcome of the appeal process, the Company intends to move forward with the project without impact to timeline or scope,” the filing said. The filing added that Trump’s National Energy Dominance Council supported the project as a priority, and the administration has selected it for expedited permitting.

“All evidence demonstrates that this critical minerals project aligns with the administration’s mission and key priorities,” said American Battery Technology Co. CEO Ryan Melsert in an email

Melsert also told POLITICO on Friday that he was puzzled by DOE’s action, considering the administration’s earlier support of the project.

“Sometimes different agencies don’t communicate with each other, and we want to make sure this is really the decision of the administration,” Melsert said.

The $117 million award to Anovion was intended to support production of synthetic graphite for lithium-ion battery anodes, including through construction of a large plant in Alabama. Anovion did not respond to a request for comment on Friday.

LuxWall planned to use its $31.7 million DOE grant for construction of an advanced glass factory at the site of an old coal plant in Detroit. In announcing the funding in 2023, the Biden administration said the company’s products would support energy efficient windows that could help slash building emissions.

LuxWall said Saturday that it plans to appeal DOE’s decision to nix the grant.

It’s unclear if DOE intends to move forward with other cancellations on the $200 billion list. After the announcement of $7.56 billion in funding cuts, Wright told CNN there would be “many more” cancellations this fall.

The circulating list has angered Democrats and prompted several Republicans to pressure DOE to save projects in their states.

Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), for example, has said that funding for a “blue” hydrogen project in Appalachia that would use natural gas and carbon capture should not be eliminated. To date, DOE has canceled more than $2 billion in funding for two hydrogen hubs on the West Coast focused on producing the fuel with renewables.",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/54/b5/fd4096d24086959c32b60918322a/https-delivery-gettyimages.com/downloads/2239622919,N,,2025-10-20 09:03:30.467511

If the amendments are approved, the state would make up the difference for the revenue school districts lose from property taxes, through a process called ""compression.""
Then there's Proposition 10, which would provide a temporary property tax exemption for people whose homes are destroyed by fire.
""As you whittle away against a property tax, you’re setting it up so that the property tax stops working.""
McPhail said the investment of state tax dollars would more than pay for itself.","Monday marks the start of early voting in Texas' Nov. 4 general election. The only statewide contests this year are ballot propositions to amend the state constitution – 17 of them, to be exact.

More than half the constitutional amendments on the ballot this fall deal with taxation, while others pertain to bail practices, dementia research and the state’s water supply.

Arguably, the most significant measures would raise homestead exemptions. They determine how much of a home's property value can be taxed to pay for public schools.

Proposition 13 would lift the homestead exemption for all Texas homeowners from $100,000 to $140,000.

""Now that will save all those 5.7 million homeowners $484 per year,"" said Republican state Sen. Paul Bettencourt of Houston, author of the measure. ""Once the voters approve of a homestead exemption for schools, it follows you, no matter where you go. That $140,000 exemption means it’s whatever your primary homestead is, and it doesn’t matter if it’s year one or year 50, that’s going to be there. So that’s a substantial lifetime benefit.""

Bettencourt is also the author of Proposition 11, which would lift the additional homestead exemption for homeowners who are over age 65 or disabled from $10,000 to $60,000. In other words, if both Propositions 11 and 13 pass, those homeowners would have a homestead exemption of $200,000.

""Now you may ask, ‘Why do more for over-65 and disabled homeowners?'"" Bettencourt said. ""They’re generally on fixed income, and they need the most help staying in their home. And in the case of seniors, you can’t argue that they already paid a lifetime of taxes and probably don’t have any current students in the public education system.""

The combined benefits, and burdens, of tax breaks

Taken together with amendments to reduce property taxes passed in earlier elections, maintaining these reductions will cost the state roughly $51 billion.

“A lot of those have been funded out of surplus money, and surplus money is one-time revenue,"" said John Diamond, director of the Center for Tax and Budget Policy at Rice University's Baker Institute for Public Policy. ""It’s not recurring revenue. So, when the surplus ends, you have to find another way to finance these reductions.""

If the amendments are approved, the state would make up the difference for the revenue school districts lose from property taxes, through a process called ""compression."" But unlike the homestead exemptions, the compressions would not be written into the constitution.

""There’s a big difference between the homestead exemptions, which are constitutionally passed and so guaranteed forever, but the compressions can be taken away just like that,"" Diamond said, snapping his fingers. ""Those are not protected.""

And that could lead to deep cuts in public education funding in lean budget years, much as Texas saw 20 years ago.

Some of the other tax measures are highly targeted. Proposition 7 would provide a full or partial homestead exemption to the surviving spouse of a veteran who died from a disease or medical condition related to their service. Proposition 17 would provide property tax relief for homeowners whose property has been affected by the installation or construction of border security infrastructure along the Mexican border.

Then there's Proposition 10, which would provide a temporary property tax exemption for people whose homes are destroyed by fire. That's another of Bettencourt's measures.

""And so we decided, fine, we’ll give them the same coverage that we do for tornadoes and hurricanes,"" Bettencourt said. “Because if your home’s burned down, you shouldn’t have to pay for all the whole full value.""

University of Houston economist Steven Craig said all those exemptions add up.

""Our heart can go out to all kinds of people, and then the question is, ‘Is this the way to help them, or is there a better way to help them?'"" Craig said. ""As you whittle away against a property tax, you’re setting it up so that the property tax stops working.""

Then there are a series of measures that would ban the state from collecting certain kinds of taxes altogether. Proposition 2 would ban capital gains taxes. Proposition 6 would ban taxes on securities transactions. That's ahead of Texas establishing its own stock exchange. And Proposition 8 would ban inheritance taxes.

Texas doesn't collect any of these at present, but Diamond said ruling them out limits the state's options when revenues from other sources fall.

""Sales taxes, I could definitely see those flattening out as the consumers' resilience finally fades,"" Diamond said, ""and then federal transfers almost certainly are going to fall and could fall significantly. That is a huge chunk of the Texas budget.""

Felony bail reform

At least three ballot measures that don't relate to taxation have potentially widespread ramifications for the state. Take Proposition 3, which would amend the constitution to allow judges to deny bail to people charged with certain felonies. Republican state Sen. Joan Huffman of Houston has been trying to get this passed since 2019.

""A judge would have to determine that either the person was going to be a threat in some way to the safety of the community or to law enforcement and/or a likelihood that the person would not return to court,"" Huffman said.

The amendment would apply only to the most serious offenses – capital murder, murder, aggravated robbery, aggravated sexual assault, aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, and continuous human trafficking.

""This doesn’t take away any of the other rights that they would have for a trial, for the state to have to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt,"" Huffman said. ""It’s just reserved for those that would be held pending trial. And I will say that many states have this exact same type of system, and the federal system operates this way for violent offenders.""

Prop 3 would affect a relatively small number of cases in the Texas justice system, about 40,000 out of more than 800,000 arrests made in Texas every year. That's according to Nick Hudson, senior manager of policy and advocacy at the ACLU of Texas. But Hudson said he has serious concerns that the measure would worsen overcrowding in Texas jails.

""I think this is very likely to pass. Our focus has been on trying to mitigate the harm it will cause,"" Hudson said. “We, along with many other people and many House and Senate negotiators, worked to ensure that there was access to lawyers baked into this proposal to blunt some of the potential negative impacts. We are happy to see that provision in, but we are really concerned that this will accelerate pretrial detention.""

Hudson argued that the measure could wind up violating one of the most basic rights of the accused.

""They have not been convicted,"" Hudson said. ""They are presumed innocent [until proven guilty], waiting for trial behind bars at a cost to taxpayers of about $1.2 billion a year.""

Investments in water infrastructure and dementia prevention

One ballot measure with a similar price tag, but less controversial, is Proposition 4. This amendment would dedicate up to $1 billion per year from existing state sales tax revenue to the Texas Water Fund for the next 20 years. The money would be used to fix some of the state's most pressing water infrastructure needs.

Sarah Rountree Schlessinger, CEO of the Texas Water Foundation, estimated the state's total needs for new water and wastewater infrastructure, as well as to replace aging infrastructure, at $150 billion, far above the maximum of $20 billion that Prop 4 would provide.

""Is it enough? No, it’s not enough to meet everything,"" Schlessinger said. ""Is it a significant move towards funding water infrastructure in Texas? Yes, significantly so.""

Schlessinger said the total amount of money the amendment would commit is less significant than the fact that the amendment provides for a dedicated and ongoing source of funds – allowing the state to better plan for long-term needs, like combatting droughts worsening in the face of climate change.

RELATED: Mayor Whitmire considers sending Houston water to West Texas – despite forecasted shortfall

Jeremy Mazur, director of infrastructure and natural resources policy at the public policy think tank Texas 2036, said Houston and other major cities have a lot riding on the passage of Prop 4.

""First, they need to expand and diversify their water supply portfolio for a dynamic, growing region,"" Mazur said. ""And second, there’s also this issue of aging, deteriorating, leaking water systems within the Houston metropolitan area that really need to be resolved sometime soon. These are systems that annoy everyday families and businesses through inadequate or leaking service, causing boil water notices or even service interruptions.""

Then there's Proposition 14, which would create a state institute for fighting dementia, formally the Dementia Prevention and Research Institute of Texas (DPRIT), similar to one Texas has already established to target cancer (CPRIT). The amendment would provide an initial $3 billion in state surplus revenue to a fund dedicated to finding medical breakthroughs, cures, and prevention.

""It would be a breakthrough,"" said Ashley McPhail, chief external affairs and administration officer at the Texas Medical Center. ""It really would make a huge difference in sort of the path and trajectory that we are on for dementia and other related diseases within this space. If you look across funding, this would be sort of the second-largest funding for something like this, for brain health outside of the [National Institutes of Health] in the United States.""

McPhail said the investment of state tax dollars would more than pay for itself. It could lure hundreds of researchers to the state and spark the creation of dozens of companies dedicated to fighting Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia, much as CPRIT has done already with cancer research. And that doesn't even touch the savings in residents' medical bills.

""Currently, over 400,000 Texans are living with Alzheimer’s, which costs families over $20 billion per year,"" McPhail said. ""Texas ranks third in the nation for the number of Alzheimer’s cases and second in the number of Alzheimer’s deaths.

So it’s little surprise that Energy Secretary Chris Wright chose the conservative academic to help write a government-backed report — released in July — that called into question the severity of global warming. Wright himself has disputed the risks of climate change, and the five authors he handpicked to write the report align with that perspective.

But a review by POLITICO’s E&E News has found another common thread.

Four of the five authors that Wright selected to write the July report have spoken out against the endangerment finding, a 2009 EPA decision that underpins many federal climate regulations. That includes Koonin, who in February urged the administration to begin the process of rolling back the endangerment finding “as soon as possible.”

The criticism from Koonin and his co-authors is significant because the report they co-wrote is being used as evidence by EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin to eliminate the endangerment finding, which Zeldin once called the “holy grail” of climate science. EPA’s plan to undo the endangerment finding cites the Wright climate report no less than 16 times, E&E News has found.

Climate scientists, environmental groups and Democrats have seized on the revelation and said it’s further proof the Wright climate report is little more than a political document — written with the express purpose of helping the Trump administration unravel climate rules made possible by the endangerment finding.

The goal of the report is “to basically develop enough soundbite-worthy quotes that policymakers could use … to try to cast doubt on the science” of global warming, said Andrew Dessler, a climate scientist at Texas A&M University who organized an academic response to the Wright climate report.

Wright has defended the report as an attempt to counter the narrative of mainstream climate science, which has made clear in thousands of peer-reviewed scientific papers that humanity’s burning of fossil fuels is heating the planet, with dangerous repercussions for people and other living things.

“Hydrocarbon-based fuels, the argument goes, must be rapidly abandoned or else we risk planetary ruin,” Wright wrote in a forward to the report.

“That view demands scrutiny,” he continued. “That’s why I commissioned this report: to encourage a more thoughtful and science-based conversation about climate change and energy.”

The writers themselves have defended the report too, with author Judith Curry, a former climatologist at the Georgia Institute of Technology, telling E&E News that it was a “red herring” to question their independence.

“This issue of ‘independence’ is never raised about scientists employed by, or affiliated with or otherwise supporting, environmental advocacy groups,” she said.

But one climate law expert argued that the authors’ past criticism of the endangerment finding — coupled with their ties to groups that have advocated for its elimination — call into question the Wright report’s credibility.

“It’s the furthest thing from an independent review, it’s a preordained review,” said Michael Gerrard, founder and faculty director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University. “It’s an additional brick in an already high wall of facts discrediting the report.”

The courts have also shown skepticism toward Wright’s framing of the report as an independent review.

Environmental groups have sued over the Wright report — largely because they don’t want it included in EPA’s review of the endangerment finding.

Last month, a federal judge denied the green groups’ attempts to bar its inclusion. But in doing so, Judge William Young of the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts — a Reagan appointee — threw cold water on Wright’s claims about its intentions.

“The conclusion of the report itself shows that it is no mere ‘review’ of the literature. To suggest otherwise borders on sophistry,” Young wrote. “No reasonable jury could find that these words, arranged as they are, do not constitute advice or recommendations for a renewed approach to climate policy.”

Endangerment critics tapped to attack it

The endangerment finding stands out as a milestone in U.S. climate policy — as it empowered the federal government to take more robust action against global warming.

Announced during the first Obama administration, the 2009 determination asserts that six greenhouse gases are driving climate change and that EPA has the authority to regulate these gases in the interest of public health.

The federal government has used the endangerment finding to implement a wide swath of climate regulations, including those intended to reduce greenhouse emissions from vehicles and power plants.

For that reason, conservatives have long sought to overturn the endangerment finding — which they say has been used to drive up prices and create unnecessary regulation.

Among its critics are four of the five authors that Wright tapped to write the July report on climate.

Chief among them is Koonin, a fellow at the Hoover Institution. Koonin organized an adversarial review of climate science during the first Trump administration, and in February, he sent Zeldin an email offering “technical assistance from me and colleagues in the review of the Endangerment Finding.”

Two other authors — University of Alabama climatologist Roy Spencer and University of Guelph economist Ross McKitrick — spoke in May at an event hosted by the conservative Heritage Foundation entitled: “Is the Sky Falling, a Reconsideration of the Endangerment Finding.”

During the Heritage event, McKitrick said “most climate policies would make societies worse off.” A 2017 paper written by McKitrick “outlines a case for re-doing the science behind the Endangerment Finding.”

For his part, Spencer was a visiting fellow at the Heritage Foundation last year as it was promoting a conservative playbook — known as Project 2025 — now being used by the Trump administration to attack a wide range of policies, including climate regulations. The document recommends the Trump administration “establish a system, with an appropriate deadline, to update the 2009 endangerment finding.”

At Heritage, Spencer wrote white papers and blog entries — one of which is cited in the Wright climate report. In the post, Spencer explicitly warns against policy based on climate models, a support beam of the endangerment finding.

He said climate models that warn of significant future warming are “unreliable” — even though mainstream scientists have shown them to be accurate.

Then there is John Christy, a University of Alabama, Huntsville, climatologist, who has spent years attacking climate models and claiming they have been manipulated. He has previously stated that the endangerment finding was a “political exercise” because parts of it were written by Obama administration officials. He pledged to work on rolling back the finding during the first Trump administration.

“When you can prove and demonstrate that climate models used for the basis of the endangerment finding can be falsified, that would at least bring the endangerment finding back for consideration,” he told E&E News in 2017.

Ties to groups opposed to climate action

Wright last week defended the authors’ backgrounds in response to questions from E&E News.

“These are not political people,” Wright said. “All of them were top and well-known scientists.”

He added the report is not about “their personal histories or their past, it’s about the science and the data.”

But at least three of the authors have ties to groups that employ and promote critics of climate action, including the endangerment finding.

In addition to his work with Heritage, Spencer has been affiliated with the Heartland Institute, which has long sought to tear down the endangerment finding.

And McKitrick is a fellow at the Fraser Institute and has been affiliated with the Cato Institute. Both have published and promoted his work advocating against the endangerment finding or other arguments against climate policy.

Koonin’s work for the Hoover Institution has long focused on tearing down the endangerment finding.

Heritage, Heartland, Cato, Hoover and Fraser have long criticized energy regulations and have collectively received millions of dollars in funding from fossil fuel industry groups or foundations that oppose regulations.

The only one of the five authors who did not have an extensive public record of targeting the endangerment finding for rollback is Curry, the former climatologist at Georgia Tech.

Speaking for the other authors of the report, she said their affiliations with outside groups did not shape the report’s findings.

“This whole issue is a red herring,” she wrote in an emailed response to questions. “The scientific content of our report, and any other report, should be judged by its merits.”",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/59/8e/d3c3615d4123af34c1ff9834c68d/https-delivery-gettyimages.com/downloads/2235553092,N,,2025-10-20 08:10:54.235741

Why it matters: The rewards and penalties on EVs reflect an industry in flux, as policymakers try to balance environmental goals with the need to pay for roads and other critical infrastructure.

State of play: Biden-era federal tax credits on EV purchases — up to $7,500 for new EVs and up to $4,000 on pre-owned EVs — were killed by Congress, effective Sept. 30.

Buyers rushed to take advantage of the expiring federal credits, leading many forecasters to predict an immediate drop in EV sales.

The numerous states with continuing incentives hope they'll sustain some level of sales momentum.

Yes, but: Ohio doesn't have any, and its fees can run counter to increasing EV adoption, note researchers at the Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan think tank that mostly supports lower taxes.

Ohioans pay a $200 annual EV registration fee, $150 for plug-in hybrids and $100 for hybrids.

Context: In car sales platform Carvana's 2024 state-by-state breakdown, EV sales in Ohio accounted for just 2.9% of used car sales.

That was lower than the national average (4.3%) and significantly behind EV hot spots that approached 10%.

What we're watching: State lawmakers are once again pushing back with a bipartisan proposal to eliminate the $100 hybrid fee.

The big picture: States fund most of their road and infrastructure budgets with revenues from federal and state gasoline taxes.

But that income isn't enough to meet rising costs, and the funding gap will keep growing as cars get more efficient and EV ownership grows.

Since EV owners don't pay gas taxes, states like Ohio levy the extra fees to ensure they pay their share for road maintenance.

Between the lines: Ohio's lack of EV tax credits may be par for the course, but our EV infrastructure lags far behind other states.

As of January, our 15.5 charging stations per 100,000 residents was far behind the top states, and even neighbors like Michigan and Pennsylvania.

To boost energy resilience, Texas lawmakers approved $1.8 billion in 2025 for the Texas Backup Power Package.

A growing body of research warns that climate disasters are disproportionately dangerous for older adults, especially those in long-term care settings who rely on others for essential support. Those risks are often compounded in rural areas, where resources are scarce and emergency support is slower to arrive.

As temperatures plummeted and power went out across Texas during the February 2021 Winter Storm Uri, a record-breaking winter storm that brought unprecedented cold and ice, staff at Gainesville Nursing and Rehabilitation, a nursing home in the rural North Texas town of Gainesville, made a desperate call: evacuate all 36 residents. The nursing home had lost both power and water and the facility’s backup systems had failed.

Fire-rescue crews scrambled to borrow school buses to move everyone to a temporary shelter at a nearby college. “We had two buses, and it probably took us four hours to move those 36 residents,” Gainesville Fire-Rescue Chief Twiner told the Gainesville Daily Register in 2021. “We had to take some of their beds—there were beds at [the shelter], but it wasn’t enough.”

Research indicates that extreme weather disproportionately affects rural areas, which also have limited capacity to respond to weather events and the prolonged utility outages that often follow.

A 2025 report from the Federation of American Scientists found that rural communities faced heightened risks from extreme heat, with residents more likely to have pre-existing health conditions, limited healthcare access, and older or substandard housing. In rural areas, heat waves disrupted work, strained local businesses, and exposed weaknesses in aging energy infrastructure, revealing a pressing need for targeted investments in health systems and resilient energy.

A 2025 study published in Natural Hazards Review further found that rural communities hit by natural disasters faced significantly longer power outage recovery times than urban areas, highlighting how limited infrastructure and resources can leave rural populations disproportionately vulnerable.

Power Outages Can Lead to Death

New research is beginning to explain the toll that Winter Storm Uri had on older populations in rural areas. The chaos in Gainesville was just one of hundreds of stories that unfolded across Texas in February 2021. Now, a 2025 study has confirmed the human toll of the severe weather event on these communities. Long-term nursing home residents whose facilities lost power or water during the storm faced significantly higher death rates than those in facilities that remained operational.

The peer-reviewed study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), found that utility failures were the driving factor behind the rise in mortality.

“We can estimate that [the outages] would contribute to about 11 or 12 excess deaths, had those nursing homes not experienced a utility outage,” said Brian Downer, PhD, associate professor in the School of Public and Population Health (SPPH) at the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) and one of the article’s authors. “To better contextualize those 11 excess deaths, the state of Texas was able to attribute about 150 deaths among adults aged 60 and older…to Winter Storm Uri.”

A 2022 study in Nature found that rural communities faced greater challenges during Winter Storm Uri. Limited resources and slower emergency support made outages harder to manage. Residents in these areas were also less prepared for prolonged power loss, highlighting vulnerabilities in infrastructure and disaster response.

“It is the rural communities that are being disproportionately affected by the power outages,” Downer said about the Nature study.

New Texas Legislation Helps Essential Services Adapt to Severe Weather

In response to such risks, the Texas Legislature authorized $1.8 billion this year for the Texas Backup Power Package, an initiative aimed at strengthening energy resilience through backup power systems and microgrids in critical facilities, including those in rural areas. The program, funded through the broader Texas Energy Fund, was designed to ensure that essential services like nursing homes, hospitals, and water systems are better equipped to remain operational during future grid emergencies.

“The extreme weather events that crippled Texas in recent years made it clear this investment was overdue,” said Texas State Representative Ana Hernandez, who serves on the Texas Backup Power Package Advisory Committee. “These backup systems allow vital facilities to keep operating even if the main grid goes down.”

The Texas Backup Power Package was passed in 2023, but didn’t receive funding until the 2025 legislative session. It will provide grants and loans for generators, battery storage, and solar systems.

State Representative Hernandez said the program rules will be drafted later this year and applications are expected online by spring 2026, with installations starting that summer. Final eligibility is still being decided, but critical facilities will be prioritized.

“By providing multi-day, stand-alone backup systems, the program ensures that vital services don’t go dark when the grid fails. Health centers, senior living facilities, emergency responders, and other critical operations will be able to stay open and serve the public,” Hernandez said. “In short, it helps communities hold steady in the face of long outages and strengthens overall resilience.”

Outages Deepened Health Risks for Older Adults

During Winter Storm Uri, Texas experienced historically low temperatures and sweeping power failures as the state’s electric grid struggled to meet surging demand.

According to the Texas Health and Human Services Commission, 578 of the state’s 1,212 nursing homes, nearly half, reported at least one incident during the storm, including 139 that lost power, 327 that had to boil water, and 121 that suffered burst pipes, water shortages, or complete water loss.

An estimated 39,000 residents, about half of all nursing home residents in the state, lived in facilities that reported such incidents, according to data compiled by the Texas Health and Human Services Commission.

For residents, those outages were more than an inconvenience. They intensified existing health risks and exposed the particular dangers that extreme temperatures pose to older adults.

Andrea Earl, associate state director of advocacy and outreach at AARP Texas, said older adults in care facilities faced heightened risks during extreme temperatures because their bodies struggle to regulate heat and cold. Many residents also have mobility issues, chronic health conditions, or cognitive impairments that limit self-care. Medication, medical equipment needs, and social isolation further increased vulnerability to extreme temperatures, according to Earl. But some nursing facilities lacked staff expertise to recognize early signs of heat or cold stress, making reliable utilities critical for protecting residents’ health.

Some of the effects of extreme weather and utility outages are not immediately detectable.

“In extreme cold, your blood starts to thicken, especially if you’re older, and that increases the risk of blood clots and other cardiovascular incidents. And I think the hard part about both is these things don’t come on right away,” Earl said.

In the JAMA study, researchers captured these longer term effects by reviewing outcomes over the course of the weeks following the storm.

“We really need to start paying attention to these more delayed effects that are coming up,” said Alex Holland, a doctoral student in population health sciences at UTMB and a co-author of the JAMA article. “In our study, we didn’t really see that difference in mortality until three weeks after winter storm Uri, so there’s somewhat of a delayed effect.”

New Backup Systems Target Future Outages

The Texas Backup Power Package aims to strengthen the state’s energy infrastructure by installing generators, microgrids, and batteries at critical facilities across the state that could run independently when there are grid failures.

Winter Storm Uri caused economic losses upwards of $80 billion. The state’s power grid faced an unprecedented surge in electricity demand and critical parts of the system failed.

To prevent a total collapse that could have taken weeks or even months to recover from, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), which manages most of Texas’s electric grid, implemented emergency blackouts.

Some of the water shortages were directly tied to ERCOT emergency directives, which required utilities to reduce power consumption to stabilize the electric grid.

In Medina County, a rural area west of San Antonio, water was unavailable during Winter Storm Uri, even for essential needs like drinking, bathing, and flushing toilets. Nursing homes in the county were among those affected, facing dangerous conditions as power and water systems failed.

As part of their research, Downer and Holland spoke with nurse practitioners at UTMB who conduct home visits to nursing homes in the area. They said the access to water can be critical to mitigate health risks and manage hygiene.

“[The nurse practitioners] were really emphasizing how both physical and oral hygiene can be really important, not only to just general quality of life and a person’s comfort, but also, too, from an infection risk, especially when it comes to oral health,” Downer said. “We felt that it would be interesting to include water outages for that reason. And then also, too, since power and water outages tend to occur together.”

Those health risks are amplified in rural areas, where limited infrastructure and slower emergency response make outages harder to manage.

Although this utility collapse was widely attributed to frozen power plants, a University of Texas study highlighted the need for better energy efficiency measures to reduce strain on the grid and protect vulnerable populations during extreme weather events.

“There’s a whole host of reasons why extreme weather events can result in lower supply,” said Joshua Rhodes, PhD, a research scientist at the University of Texas and one of the report’s authors. “[During Winter Storm Uri,] we saw [that] every single kind of power plant didn’t perform as well as we would have liked it to perform. We saw power plants freeze, be they coal, natural gas or nuclear, wind. We saw snow on top of solar panels. But we also saw the natural gas sector freeze…we lost the ability to produce about 80% of the natural gas in the Permian Basin, and so we weren’t able to move as much natural gas. We also had a bunch of power plants that just couldn’t get fuel.”

Winter Storm Uri brought the state’s energy sector to a standstill and future extreme weather threatens to do the same.

“Texas is seeing more disasters as more people live in areas where we have hurricanes, and as, just generally, more people are around, and we rely on more things for electricity,” Rhodes said.

To boost energy resilience, Texas lawmakers approved $1.8 billion in 2025 for the Texas Backup Power Package.

“We’re recognizing that there are thousands of facilities across the state, many in rural areas, but some also in urban areas, that provide vital community services, like water treatment facilities, fresh water facilities, assisted living centers and other medical facilities…,” said Texas Senator Nathan Johnson, who led legislation to create and fund the Texas Backup Power Package. “So in order to make that more affordable, what we wanted to do is just put some state money behind it.”

“Modern life runs on electricity,” Rhodes said. “I think it’s good that we’re at least keeping the critical parts of that life, of that livelihood, up and running whenever we run into issues.”

An Uncertain Pathway Forward

Researchers and advocates said that while the Texas Backup Power Package has potential to serve long-term care residents, it is not a guaranteed fix.

During the 2025 legislative session, lawmakers failed to pass SB 481, which would have required nursing and assisted living facilities in Texas to maintain safe temperatures during emergencies with backup power systems. Without such state regulations, Earl expressed concern that many facilities may be unaware of the Texas Backup Power Package program or lack the capacity to apply for it.

“A lot of these places are understaffed…so any extra administrative processes might be a hindrance to why they would apply,” Earl said. “We’re hopeful that facilities out there are paying attention to [the backup power package], but I think that’s another thing too. How well is this fund going to be marketed? Are we going to see these facilities know firsthand that they can apply for this? How are they going to find out about it?”

Holland said that the successful implementation of backup power also depends on training and education for effective emergency preparedness.

“Now there’s funding available to help with these backup power sources, like the Texas Backup Power Package. But then the question becomes like, well, then what? These facilities might not know, what is the best power supply backup for us? Where should we put them?” Holland said. “We see sometimes that generators end up getting put on the floor and ground level in areas that are prone to flooding or nursing home staff aren’t trained on how to use this emergency backup equipment.”

Without proper guidance and preparation, the funding alone cannot guarantee that facilities will be ready when disaster strikes.

“Disaster preparedness is for everybody,” Holland said. “I think especially that’s something that lends itself very strongly to rural communities [where] you kind of have that ‘everybody knows everybody’ feel. And so taking that into the disaster preparedness side of things, and knowing how your city or your county is preparing for some of these events, or, what are the resources in place, kind of at that local level, also definitely come into mind.”

Earl emphasized that emergency preparedness shouldn’t wait for tragedy.

“We don’t think death should be the underlying reason for, or the catalyst for, doing backup power and requiring a certain level of power in these facilities,” Earl said. “We think that there’s a lot of dignity with this stage of life and where you’re at and that that should be preserved, especially if you are paying to be in a facility and putting your hard earned dollars and assuming and expecting a certain level of care.”

Swear in Adelita Grijalva.","Details

By Levi Rickert

October 20, 2025

Opinion. When U.S. Rep. Raúl M. Grijalva (D-Ariz.) passed away on March 13, 2025 at the age of 77, Indian Country lost one of its strongest voices in Congress. After more than two decades in Congress, Grijalva championed Native American issues, supporting tribal sovereignty, environmental justice and education equity.

Grijalva’s district, Arizona’s 7th Congressional District — stretching from Tucson to the Phoenix suburbs — is home to the Tohono O’odham Nation, Pascua Yaqui Tribe and Cocopah Tribe. According to 2024 Census estimates, more than 30,000 Native people live in the district.

These tribes, along with more than 800,000 residents, have been left without a representative in Congress for more than six months.

In a special election held Sept. 23, 2025, voters chose Grijalva’s daughter, Adelita Grijalva, 54, to carry on her father’s legacy, which includes his support of Indian country. She won decisively, with 69% of the vote—defeating her Republican opponent by a 40-point margin. Yet, despite this clear electoral mandate, Grijalva has not been sworn in.

The reason? Speaker of the House Mike Johnson (R-La.) has refused to administer the oath, citing procedural concerns related to the ongoing government shutdown. But observers from across the political spectrum aren’t buying that explanation. Many believe the real motive is political — and personal.

Grijalva’s swearing-in has been tied up in Johnson’s calculations around the House’s razor-thin majority. Her vote would be the 218th and final signature needed to force a vote on a bipartisan discharge petition to release Justice Department files tied to Jeffrey Epstein — the convicted sex offender with powerful associates in both political parties.

Johnson says the delay is “standard practice,” but that claim doesn’t hold up. Members of Congress — Republican and Democrat alike — have been sworn in during recesses and even during pro-forma sessions. The rules, when politically convenient, have been flexible. But now, with a key vote hanging in the balance, the process has suddenly hardened.

Meanwhile, Grijalva says her Capitol Hill office lacks computers. She cannot access the office congressional email system or hire staff. Her district has no voice in Congress.

For Native constituents in Arizona’s 7th District, the absence is especially significant. These communities often face underrepresentation and systemic neglect. To leave them without a representative—after they voted overwhelmingly—is an affront to the values of representative democracy.

Johnson’s delay has the practical effect of protecting members of his party from a politically uncomfortable vote. The bipartisan Epstein petition — led by Reps. Thomas Massie (R-Ky) and Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) — seeks to force transparency on a matter that should never have been hidden in the first place. But Johnson, who claims to support transparency, has quietly worked to block the effort.

By withholding Adelita Grijalva’s swearing-in, Johnson preserves the Republican majority by one vote and keeps the petition from triggering a floor vote. It’s a maneuver of convenience—not principle. He insists that the delay has nothing to do with the Epstein files. But the timeline—and the stakes—tell a different story.

This is not about ceremony. It’s about control.

When citizens cast their ballots in a free and fair election, they expect the winner to take office. Period. Delays like this erode trust — not just in a political party, but in democracy itself. What message does it send when a duly elected representative from a border district — who happens to be Latina and Native-serving — is told to wait her turn while Johnson plays procedural games?

Adelita Grijalva said it best: “The people of Southern Arizona have voted clearly, yet more than 812,000 people are still denied their voice in Congress.”

Special elections in Republican-leaning districts have not faced this kind of obstruction. GOP winners have been seated during House recesses or without ceremony. In Grijalva’s case, however, the clock keeps ticking — and so does the silence from Washington.

Adelita Grijalva deserves to be sworn in without delay—not because of who her father was, but because her district voted for her. She earned the trust of her constituents and should be working on their behalf right now.

Johnson’s refusal to seat her amounts to disenfranchisement. It denies representation to hundreds of thousands of Americans — Native and non-Native alike. And it does so in service of political strategy, not constitutional duty.

Every day this delay continues, the House of Representatives becomes less representative. Democracy suffers. Transparency stalls. And the message to voters becomes painfully clear: Your voice matters only when it’s politically convenient.

It’s time for Johnson to stop hiding behind the process and do his job. Swear in Adelita Grijalva. Let the people’s voice be heard. Let her get working on behalf of the Arizona tribes in the 7th congressional district.

Anything less is a betrayal of democracy.

,Indiana American Energy ,2025-10-20 09:05:47+00:00,The Indianapolis Star,Wind and solar face resistance in Indiana despite statewide push for more energy options,"Sophie Hartley, Elizabeth Weise, Karl Schneider",,,,,https://www.indystar.com/story/news/environment/2025/10/20/wind-solar-face-resistance-indiana-despite-governor-braun-push-more-energy-options/86676693007/,"“I'm concerned about that for all energy development,” said Suzanne Jaworowski, Indiana's top energy official, in an interview with IndyStar.
This is considered a “suitable” speed for wind energy development, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.
Indiana’s first wind project, the Benton County Wind Farm, went online in 2008.
One solution proposed by Indiana lawmakers is creating statewide standards for renewable energy projects.
Right now, individual Indiana counties have the authority to create ordinances dictating regulations on solar and wind project developments.","Energy seems to be on everyone’s mind these days.

Hoosiers are watching their electric bills balloon, communities are rallying against energy-gobbling data centers, and government officials, consumer advocates and utilities have competing interests and ideas for how to move forward, including building several nuclear reactors.

All the while, opportunities for renewable energy development — which could quickly alleviate some of the pain from electric bills and electricity demand from new industry — are constricting across the state.

A USA TODAY and IndyStar investigation found that 40 of Indiana’s 92 counties had bans or impediments on new wind development and 24 counties had similar restrictions on solar energy as of September 2025. Battery storage systems, which are emissions-free energy sources, are also facing opposition; a Hamilton County proposal was axed this summer after the community pushed back.

With energy demands anticipated to rise significantly in the coming years, especially due to the buildout of AI and data centers, the speed at which wind and solar projects can be built is in their favor. A solar farm can go up in as little as 18 months. With current gas turbine backlogs, a natural gas plant can take five years and nuclear a decade or more.

Gov. Mike Braun campaigned on an all-of-the-above approach to addressing the state’s energy crisis, so for Braun's energy secretary, the county-level pushback to new renewable development isn't helping Indiana’s beleaguered energy grid.

“I'm concerned about that for all energy development,” said Suzanne Jaworowski, Indiana's top energy official, in an interview with IndyStar.

Counties currently have power over whether or not to allow projects like wind and solar. Efforts to move more authority to the state level have failed in recent years, and controversy over who should green-light energy projects remains. Jaworowski has previously railed against counties who court energy projects for months or years, only to reject them in the end. She called the practice “disgraceful” according to reporting from the Indiana Capital Chronicle.

So, the state is working on a solution.

Jaworowski hopes to unveil the first iteration of a map in November that could guide interested developers toward counties looking to bring in more industry, which would include renewable energy projects.

“We're trying to be strategic about inviting counties to raise their hand to say, ‘Yeah, we're interested in this,’ or ‘No, we're not,’” Jaworowski said. Counties can note interest in industrial projects like wind, solar, batteries, nuclear or even data centers.

It’s not a commitment, Jaworowski added. Rather, it’s a way for counties and developers to match interests early in the development process so as not to waste time and money.

Indiana feels the breeze

Even without state guidance, developers found their way into Indiana counties to build renewable projects decades ago.

Bryan Berry, a Benton County landowner who later became a commissioner, started wondering about bringing wind to the county in the late 1990s.

When he raised the idea to sitting commissioners, “they laughed at me,” Berry said. They “said that will never happen, you know, it’s not windy enough here to do that.”

But Benton, on the western edge of Indiana, is one of the breeziest parts of the country where it counts: hundreds of feet above the county’s fields and farmland.

Developers eventually caught wind of the county’s potential. When they touched down in the mid-2000s they were met with swaths of wide-open farmland and high wind speeds. Eighty meters (about 262 feet) above some of the plains in central and northern Indiana, the wind races past at more than 7.5 meters per second (about 25 feet per second). This is considered a “suitable” speed for wind energy development, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.

Berry saw early on the county was poised to gain financially if it allowed wind farms to move in.

“There’s not a lot of industry, not a lot of jobs, and not a lot of people,” he said. This trifecta can make taxes a burden for rural families. But wind development could lead to an influx in the county’s assessed valuation and drop property tax rates.

Indiana’s first wind project, the Benton County Wind Farm, went online in 2008. That spring, Indiana’s first turbines — 85 in total — started adding megawatts to the grid.

And over the next several years, Berry saw property tax rates drop.

“I don’t know where it would be if we didn’t have the assessed value of the wind turbines,” he said.

Development across the state has since escalated. Now, most of the state’s wind projects sit in a corridor that stretches from Benton County east to Randolph on the Ohio border. By mid-2024, Indiana had about 3,400 megawatts of wind capacity, according to the U.S. Energy Information Agency. Over 10 percent of Indiana’s total in-state energy production came from wind in 2024, and over 3 percent came from solar.

Indiana feels the burn

But Benton was a special case.

Despite the economic boon wind and solar can provide for rural economies, county governments across the state have begun placing significant impediments and outright bans on their development. Many of the restrictions have cropped up over the last two years.

Some counties have such strict regulations on noise or location that it has become effectively impossible to build new wind projects. For example, from the front porch of a nearby house, wind turbines don't typically sound louder than a household refrigerator, which hums at around 55 dBA. But Wabash County limits sound from turbines to 32 dBA.

Counties like Huntington restrict solar panels from being placed on “prime farmland,” and counties like Jay and Parke have placed temporary moratoriums on wind, solar and/or battery storage.

County-wide pushback like this is concerning for organizations like the Indiana Conservative Alliance for Energy (ICAE).

Like Jaworowski, ICAE wants to see an all-of-the-above approach to energy in Indiana, which would encompass everything from coal and nuclear to solar, wind and hydropower. So the organization is trying to divert conversations about wind and solar away from politics, which has historically influenced attitudes toward renewables.

“We need to have more of these fact-based conversations to really make good energy policy,” Anderson said. Bringing the conversations about renewable energy out of the ever-changing political landscape is important, he added, because projects take so long to get approval. It's difficult for developers to propose projects will satisfy the energy grid's needs and the needs of their business model when national attitudes can change on a whim.

One solution proposed by Indiana lawmakers is creating statewide standards for renewable energy projects. Right now, individual Indiana counties have the authority to create ordinances dictating regulations on solar and wind project developments. Other states, like Wisconsin, have seen much of this control moved to the state level.

Indiana attempted to implement similar statewide standards, but proposed bills faltered in 2021 and in 2025. Simply put, it's controversial.

Unsubstantiated rumors still swirl online and in county meetings that wind, solar and battery storage facilities will degrade the environment, destroy rural culture and lower property values.

“Utilities across the country are warning operators to be ready for sudden power shutoffs,” explained James Roth, the head of global policy and government affairs at Bloom Energy.
Operators begin to recognize the value of onsite systems in the face of unexpected utility power shutoffs.
The logic is simple: the more control a data center has over its power, the less exposed it is to regulatory risk and sudden disconnections.
What that means in practice, however, is that a new method of data center siting is emerging, where the map is drawn around storage potential rather than just transmission lines.","In Texas, a new kind of reliability standard is reshaping where data centers choose to build and how they power their operations. Under a “kill switch” law that was adopted earlier this year, utilities can forcibly disconnect large, noncritical industrial users like hyperscale data centers during grid emergencies to keep electricity flowing to the largest number of people.

“Utilities across the country are warning operators to be ready for sudden power shutoffs,” explained James Roth, the head of global policy and government affairs at Bloom Energy. He told ESS News that, for operators with contractual uptime commitments, the risk of sudden shutoffs is “simply unsustainable.”

While the Texas bill does also include a voluntary demand response program, it could still spell trouble for data center operators with 24/7 uptime guarantees or AI workloads that can’t afford a second of downtime. That’s where storage comes in. Operators begin to recognize the value of onsite systems in the face of unexpected utility power shutoffs.

The logic is simple: the more control a data center has over its power, the less exposed it is to regulatory risk and sudden disconnections. In Texas, that could look like installing batteries capable of supporting independent operations when a kill switch is triggered.

According to Roth, it’s no surprise that major cloud players like Oracle are looking to shield their operations using onsite storage and generation. What that means in practice, however, is that a new method of data center siting is emerging, where the map is drawn around storage potential rather than just transmission lines.

The general idea remains the same across state lines, but what it looks like in practice varies greatly. In California, for instance, ensuring steady access to power as quickly as possible means designing storage-backed microgrids that let a data center jump the queue and bypass long interconnection wait times.

It’s more of a structural problem, though it’s one that makes traditional grid expansion nearly impossible at the pace AI-driven workloads demand.

“Operators there are adopting islanded microgrids to bypass utility delays,” explained Roth. But, he cautioned, there’s also a political dimension.

California’s Application for Certification (AFC) process still treats onsite systems over a certain size as “thermal” plants regardless of the type of energy they use. Effectively, this locks the project into a series of slow-moving environmental reviews designed for gas infrastructure.

“Lengthy permitting constructs like California’s AFC process…must be reinterpreted,” Roth added, “to accommodate new solutions that can be deployed quickly and reliably.”

“Getting the policy framework right will determine whether the US effectively captures the economic benefits of the AI boom,” he noted.",https://www.ess-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2048px-Bloom_Energy_Servers_at_eBay.jpg,N,,2025-10-20 08:08:13.815208

“The hyperscalers and data center developers are eager to fund this,” Guernsey told Canary Media.

Data center developers will face cost and air-quality challenges in using their ubiquitous diesel-fueled backup generators for on-site power.
Similar pressures are pushing up costs across the Midwest, and in data center hotspots like Georgia and Texas.","Data centers are creating problems for the congested, overburdened U.S. power grid. One company thinks it can crowdsource the solution.

California-based Voltus operates ​“virtual power plants” across North America, controlling the amount of electricity that participating homes and businesses consume or send to the grid via resources like rooftop solar and batteries.

Last month, the firm unveiled its ​“bring your own capacity” plan. Put simply, the idea is for data center operators to pay other utility customers to reduce their power use when electricity demand peaks, a move that would diminish strain on the system without disrupting computing processes at data centers.

The proposal comes as the nationwide boom in data center construction pushes electricity demand — and prices — to new heights. These conditions are putting pressure on data center developers, utilities, regulators, and regional grid operators to find ways to enable rapid construction that don’t break the grid, or customers’ wallets.

That’s where the bring-your-own-capacity concept could fill the gaps, said Dana Guernsey, Voltus’ CEO and cofounder.

The approach benefits utilities and their customers because it’s a lot cheaper to reduce energy use than it is to build new power plants and infrastructure. And it benefits data centers by offering a much faster route to getting a grid interconnection, as developers wouldn’t have to wait years for utilities to bring new power generation online.

“The hyperscalers and data center developers are eager to fund this,” Guernsey told Canary Media. ​“It’s more affordable, it’s faster, and it’s an investment back into the communities.”

Voltus is in a good position to spearhead this work, she said. As a virtual power plant operator, it already aggregates backup batteries, electric vehicles, smart appliances, and other fast-responding technologies to provide on-demand relief to the grid. Voltus was recently dubbed the top company in this sector by analytics firm Wood Mackenzie, and after several years of rapid growth, it now has more than 7.5 gigawatts of scattered ​“demand response” capacity under management.

In general, virtual power plants, or VPPs, could meet 10% to 20% of U.S. peak grid needs in the coming years and save utility customers roughly $10 billion in annual costs, according to a U.S. Department of Energy analysis released in January. Voltus’ new plan is to harness the power of VPPs to help specifically with the data-center-driven electricity crunch — a creative idea with big potential, if the company can convince utilities to play ball.

What data center developers are looking for

Voltus already has one developer on board to participate in its bring-your-own-capacity plan: Cloverleaf Infrastructure, which builds gigawatt-scale data centers.

“The right way to serve data center load quickly, at scale, and less expensively and more sustainably, is to leverage the existing resources on the grid as efficiently as possible,” said Brian Janous, Cloverleaf’s chief commercial officer.

Data centers, which are facing yearslong wait times to connect to the grid, are considering every available option. In Wisconsin, Cloverleaf is planning a flagship data center project that could draw up to 3.5 gigawatts of power from the grid when it’s fully built at the end of 2030. Cloverleaf has worked with utility We Energies and its parent company, WEC Energy Group, to develop a tariff that will put the onus on Cloverleaf to pay for the new resources the utility is building to meet its facility’s energy needs.

While specifics on that deal remain confidential, Janous noted that it could include demand response and VPP resources.

“The conversation we’ve been having with utilities is, we want to connect fast. If you tell us, ​‘You have to come back in seven years, after the completion of my latest gas-fired power plant,’ I’ll go somewhere else,” he said. But if Cloverleaf can work with a company like Voltus to supply the necessary energy capacity within months, a utility may be able to connect a data center faster.

Guernsey highlighted other examples of data centers bringing their own capacity to utilities. In August, Google announced agreements with Indiana Michigan Power and the Tennessee Valley Authority to reduce the peak loads of data centers in their territories.

Most of the attention on those deals focused on Google’s commitment to shift its computing workloads to reduce peak grid demand — a novel approach to data center power flexibility that tackles the electricity consumption of the massive racks of servers within the facilities’ walls.

But part of Google’s deal with Indiana Michigan Power includes transferring credits for a portion of carbon-free energy Google has contracted to serve its data centers in the region to help the utility meet its capacity requirements. In this case, the tech giant offered up its renewable-energy resources to cover its data centers’ power use, but Google could have leveraged VPPs for that purpose just as easily, Guernsey said.

Ben Hertz-Shargel, global head of grid-edge research for Wood Mackenzie, agreed that VPPs are theoretically a faster and cheaper means of achieving data center flexibility compared to the alternatives.

Most tech companies haven’t done the hard work that Google has done over the past decade or so to enable flexible computing, he said. Data center developers will face cost and air-quality challenges in using their ubiquitous diesel-fueled backup generators for on-site power. And they may be loath to invest in more expensive options like on-site solar, batteries, and gas-fired generators and microturbines — the ​“build-your-own-power plants” model some developers are pursuing.

“We don’t think that’s going to be faster or cheaper or more sustainable,” Janous said of the latter model. ​“We think the better approach is to work with companies like Voltus on how to bring more available resources into the mix.”

Demand-response programs and VPPs can also counteract utility customers’ rising power bills, since these initiatives financially compensate the individuals who allow their energy use to be managed.

“You’re paying homeowners and business owners to be part of the solution to accommodate data centers,” Hertz-Shargel said. ​“They’re already facing large and growing bill increases, not just because of large loads but because of utility investments, costs of climate change. This is a way to offset that.”

Are data center developers willing to pay?

It won’t be easy to turn these ideas into reality.

Utilities and regional grid operators consider demand response and VPPs primarily as a tool for managing existing grid stresses, but are far less eager to allow VPPs to substitute for building more traditional power plants and upgrading the grid. It’s always a tall order to get utilities to do something for the first time, but especially so when dealing with data centers, which can require a small city’s worth of electricity for their operations.

Guernsey conceded these challenges to Voltus’ plan. ​“Most of the deals we’re discussing start in 2027 or 2028 time frame,” she said. ​“We’re just running as fast as we can to keep up. We’re growing at a clip of about a gigawatt a year across North America. … In particular regions where data centers are getting built, we usually respond with, ​‘We can get a couple hundred megawatts in a given territory within that time.’”

One of Voltus’ key early targets is PJM Interconnection, a grid operator responsible for the transmission system and energy markets serving Washington, D.C., and 13 states from Virginia to Illinois. Electricity bills are spiking for the region’s more than 65 million residents — primarily due to data centers. Similar pressures are pushing up costs across the Midwest, and in data center hotspots like Georgia and Texas.

Johannes Pfeifenberger, a grid-planning expert and principal with The Brattle Group, has argued for years that grid operators need to embrace VPPs and other innovations to deal with rising demand. Among those options, ​“a VPP is very attractive, whether it’s storage, or controlled EV charging, or heating and air conditioning controls,” he said.

But putting this solution into practice will require grid operators to restructure the rules by which VPPs can directly reduce a data center’s impact on the system, he said. PJM and the Southwest Power Pool, which serves 14 Midwest and Great Plains states, are starting to take on these challenges, but their efforts remain a work in progress.

Data centers may also be limited by the capacity of the power lines and substations at the points they’re seeking to connect to the grid, he said. VPPs that consist of customers scattered across a grid operator’s territory can’t relieve those specific stresses, although other options could, such as data centers colocating at spots with ample grid capacity and building their own generation to fill those gaps, he said.

Guernsey agreed that Voltus’ bring-your-own-capacity construct ​“can only be a solution when capacity is the problem. If the data center is creating an acute distribution level constraint or requires a substation upgrade, that’s a different type of problem.”

Janous thinks data center developers are willing to pay even more than the currently inflated prices for energy if it means they can move faster. Grid operators just have to be willing to allow them to cut deals with companies like Voltus to go do it.

In the face of those pressures, allowing data centers and VPP providers to bring their own capacity is the kind of fast-track effort that could actually succeed at the speed needed, Guernsey said. And it’s a way to make sure that big developers — rather than ordinary consumers — are the ones paying for the energy capacity that data centers require.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/data-centers-in-northern-virginia.jpeg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=419f20cfcad02f9cd92d6ca5e30aaec3,N,,2025-10-20 08:08:24.261229

Jeff Landry this week signed an Executive Order declaring a moratorium on review of new permit applications for Class VI underground injection wells in the state and directing prioritized review of several pending applications seeking to construct Class VI wells in connection with proposed carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) facilities across the state to proceed.

The order directs the Louisiana Department of Energy and Natural Resources (LDENR) to suspend review of any new applications to construct a Class VI well submitted after its effective date and to spend the next 45 days reevaluating the status of the approximately 33 pending permit applications already received. The order prioritizes review of five specified applications for CCS projects in Point Coupee, Vernon, Calcasieu, Cameron, Caldwell and Ascension parishes.

Class VI wells are one of the core components of carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) facilities, which capture and liquefy carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from industrial sources such as power generation and manufacturing plants for reuse or disposal. The construction of a Class VI well allows CCS facilities to permanently remove their captured CO2emissions from the atmosphere by injecting the liquid CO2into underground geological formations. The resulting reduction in emissions can then be used or sold in carbon markets worldwide to offset emissions increases associated with expanding industrial activities under federal and foreign air permitting regimes.

Louisiana, one of the first states to be granted authority to regulate its own Class VI injection wells by the Environmental Protection Agency in late 2023, is a particularly attractive option for proposed CCS hubs due to its close proximity to manufacturing and energy corridors across the Southeast and its favorable subsurface geology, which features deep saline aquifers and porous rock reservoirs offering ample pore space.

Gov. Landry's order notes that some projections have found that announced CCS projects alone have the potential to generate 17,000 new jobs and $76 billion dollars in capital investments across the state. However, many of these projects have not yet submitted applications to construct the Class VI injection wells necessary for CO2storage. The order could pause the development of these and any new CCS projects in Louisiana indefinitely.

CCS projects in the state have faced increasing scrutiny from parish governments and local community groups, and the order acknowledges the concerns of ""citizens and communities"" while citing recent state legislation requiring the LDENR to give ""substantial consideration"" to local governments' comments on permit applications and other CCS-related actions. The order also points to President Donald Trump's support of ""energy innovation by advancing technologies"" such as CCS and several national executive orders regarding energy, which it finds ""necessitate constant evaluation of Louisiana's own energy policies and laws."" Although CCS technology may ""provide an opportunity to lift citizens of Louisiana out of poverty,"" the order says this must be balanced against the State's ""vital obligation to protect the health, safety, and welfare of its citizens and the environment.""

Keep in mind, the order does not provide for an automatic end to the new review moratorium after the LDENR's 45-day review period for pending applications ends. It remains unclear when consideration of new Class VI permit application may resume. In the meantime, the order and related LDENR memoranda make it clear that even pending permits will not be prioritized for review until they have been determined to be complete and compliant with regulatory procedures.

The Phelps Project Development Team is continuing to monitor these new developments.

The Mountain State Plugging Fund will ensure that Diversified Energy’s natural gas and oil wells are safely plugged and retired without expense to West Virginia’s taxpayers.

“What I love about this product that we’re rolling out today is that it outlasts me. It outlasts the governor. It outlasts the (state Department of Environmental Protection),” Hutson said. It’s going to be in place, and it will go on for decades and will take all of the burden off the taxpayers. That was something that was very, very important to us as we looked at it.”

The agreement between the state and Diversified Energy also mandates that the company, through its subsidiary Next LVL Energy, will retire at least 1,500 natural gas and oil wells in the first two decades, or approximately 250 wells per year when fully implemented. Both Morrisey and Hutson said this plan will help create between 50-100 jobs in the oil and natural gas industry with average salaries of $70,000 and help improve the environment.

“That’s a great opportunity for the Mountain State,” Morrisey said. “I’m hopeful that through today’s announcement, this is just going to be the beginning in the series for the Mountain State. Because the truth is today is about the wonderful partnership between the State of West Virginia and Diversified. But there’s still a lot of other wells that need to be plugged.”

According to a 2024 report from West Virginia University’s Bridge Initiative in Science and Technology Policy, Leadership, and Communications, there were more than 6,500 documented orphaned oil and natural gas wells in the state, defined as abandoned wells that have been idle for 12 months or more. However, when factoring in undocumented wells, that number grows to more than 21,000.

When the owner of a well cannot be identified, it becomes the state’s responsibility for plugging the well, but doing so is a costly endeavor. According to the WVU Bridge Initiative, the average cost for plugging a well is approximately $50,000 per well, though that cost can increase depending on the type of well and the terrain.

West Virginia has an Oil and Gas Reclamation Fund where forfeited bonds paid by companies for drilling vertical and horizontal oil and gas wells are deposited. However, there is a question about whether existing bond rates are high enough to avoid putting most of the cost for plugging orphaned wells directly on West Virginia taxpayers through the Department of Environmental Protection.

“I sponsored a couple of little bills through the Legislature that created little trickles of money for well plugging. So, it’s an issue that I was on a long time ago,” said Del. Bill Anderson, R-Wood, chairman of the House Energy and Public Works Committee.

“I think this is a monumental step forward,” Anderson continued. “It is a basically private industry stepping up to partner with our DEP to deal with the long-term environmental problems that have legacy issues that have been handed to us for more than 100 years. Anything we can do to improve well plugging and improve the quality of everything in the state, I am behind.”

Some orphaned wells have been sitting abandoned for decades, causing air pollution through methane emissions, or groundwater contamination from the slow leaking of oil and other contaminants.

Earlier this year, Morrisey signed House Bill 3336, creating an inexpensive way to cap abandoned wells. The bill allows oil and natural gas companies to plug abandoned wells by piercing the outer casing and pumping cement into the well. Prior to the passage of HB 3336, companies were required to remove most of a well’s equipment.

“I was happy to sponsor the bill, and I think this is a great continuation of that effort,” said Del. Mark Zatezalo, R-Hancock, the vice chairman of the House Energy and Public Works Committee. “If we can pull more people into this type of a program, it can only be a benefit.

“I don’t know how many of you know, but there are thousands of wells in the state that are abandoned,” Zatezalo continued. “You can argue how much environmental damage they do, but the fact that they’re open is something that you cannot overlook. The more aggressive we are with that, the better off we’re going to be.”

West Virginia has also received some federal funding for capping orphaned wells. The 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act included $4.7 billion for orphaned wells, with West Virginia already receiving $56.2 million through the U.S. Department of the Interior’s Orphaned Wells Program Office.",http://d14e0irai0gcaa.cloudfront.net/www.theintermountain.com/images/2016/09/26134117/fblike.jpg,N,,2025-10-20 08:09:39.348459

The federal incentive program for electric vehicle buyers has come to an end. As of September 30, 2025, the US government officially stopped funding your next electric car, causing concern among automakers about a sharp drop in demand.

State Alternatives

However, this does not necessarily mean a complete absence of any assistance. Depending on where you live, your state may still support you with its own tax credit scheme.

Who Continues to Support?

Some states remain extremely tight-fisted with funds, meaning there is no universal discount like the former federal assistance of $7,500. According to new data from the Tax Foundation, the situation at the state level resembles a patchwork mosaic of benefits, penalties, and bureaucracy.

While some states still roll out the red carpet for electric vehicles, others quietly burden owners with new registration fees to compensate for lost fuel tax revenue, highlighting the differing attitudes towards green policy across the country.

Ford and General Motors canceled an electric vehicle tax credit loophole after allegations of fraud with taxpayer funds.

Several states remain firmly on the buyer’s side, including Colorado, which from November this year will provide subsidies of up to $9,000 to low- and middle-income families who trade in an old gasoline car for a new electric vehicle, and up to $6,000 for a supported one.

Oregon and Maine offer credits of $7,500, Oklahoma provides up to $5,500, and Connecticut and Vermont will reduce the price of your electric vehicle by $5,000. Illinois, Kansas, and New Jersey make $4,000 available, and various other states will add from $1,500 to $3,500 to encourage you to switch to electric transport.

Where Electric Vehicles Cost More

Then come the less friendly states. Georgia has no electric vehicle incentives at all, and drivers pay $235 per year just to register their electric vehicle. Indiana is likely even worse: there are also no electric vehicle incentives, a $230 fee is charged for registering such a vehicle, and $77 for registering a hybrid.

Perhaps unexpectedly, given its history of leadership on environmental issues, California no longer offers state assistance to electric vehicle buyers. Governor Gavin Newsom recently stated that it is currently economically unviable to provide assistance, although his office later suggested that a scheme could be introduced next year.

Some states not only rely on electric vehicle registration fees to help compensate for lost gasoline sales revenue but also add a tax on the cost of charging at public charging stations. Such states include Georgia, Iowa, Kentucky, and Oklahoma, reports the Tax Foundation, also noting a flaw in their plan: drivers who charge at home avoid this fee.

Tax Foundation

We have simplified this table from the Tax Foundation. The original contains notes about which states offer other assistance, such as sales tax exemptions or a mileage-based taxation option instead of paying a registration tax.

The conclusion is that the cancellation of federal tax credits by the government does not necessarily mean you can no longer afford this electric vehicle. You just need to check what position your state takes on this issue. The difference in approaches between states can be very significant – from thousands of dollars in assistance to hundreds of dollars in additional annual costs, making geographic location one of the key factors when buying electric transport in modern conditions.",https://topgir.com.ua/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/4tgf3qrved-cgv4refdv-1024x576-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-20 08:06:49.471415

Alberta’s oil sands sector is one of Canada’s most important industries — and also one of its most misunderstood.

Here are five common myths, and the facts behind them.

Myth: Oil sands emissions are unchecked

Reality: Oil sands emissions are strictly regulated and monitored. Producers are making improvements through innovation and efficiency.

The sector’s average emissions per barrel – already on par with the average oil consumed in the United States, according to S&P Global – continue to go down.

The province reports that oil sands emissions per barrel declined by 26 per cent per barrel from 2012 to 2023. At the same time, production increased by 96 per cent.

Analysts with S&P Global call this a “structural change” for the industry where production growth is beginning to rise faster than emissions growth.

The firm continues to anticipate a decrease in total oil sands emissions within the next few years.

The Pathways Alliance — companies representing about 95 per cent of oil sands activity — aims to significantly cut emissions from production through a major carbon capture and storage (CCS) project and other innovations.

Myth: There is no demand for oil sands production

Reality: Demand for Canadian oil – which primarily comes from the oil sands – is strong and rising.

Today, America imports more than 80 per cent more oil from Canada than it did in 2010, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA).

New global customers also now have access to Canadian oil thanks to the opening of the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion in 2024.

Exports to countries outside the U.S. increased by 180 per cent since the project went into service, reaching a record 525,000 barrels per day in July 2025, according to the Canada Energy Regulator.

The world’s appetite for oil keeps growing — and it’s not stopping anytime soon.

According to the latest EIA projections, the world will consume about 120 million barrels per day of oil and petroleum liquids in 2050, up from about 104 million barrels per day today.

Myth: Oil sands projects cost too much

Reality: Operating oil sands projects deliver some of the lowest-cost oil in North America, according to Enverus Intelligence Research.

Unlike U.S. shale plays, oil sands production is a long-life, low-decline “manufacturing” process without the treadmill of ongoing investment in new drilling, according to BMO Capital Markets.

Vast oil sands reserves support mining projects with no drilling, and the standard SAGD drilling method involves about 60 per cent fewer wells than the average shale play, BMO says.

After initial investment, Enverus says oil sands projects typically break even at less than US$50 per barrel WTI.

Myth: Indigenous communities don’t support the oil sands

Reality: Indigenous communities play an important role in the oil sands sector through community agreements, business contracts and, increasingly, project equity ownership.

Oil sands producers spent an average of $1.8 billion per year with 180 Indigenous-affiliated vendors between 2021 and 2023, according to the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers.

Indigenous communities are now owners of key projects that support the oil sands, including Suncor Energy’s East Tank Farm (49 per cent owned by two communities); the Northern Courier pipeline system (14 per cent owned by eight communities); and the Athabasca Trunkline, seven operating Enbridge oil sands pipelines (~12 per cent owned by 23 communities).

These partnerships strengthen Indigenous communities with long-term revenue, helping build economic reconciliation.

Myth: Oil sands development only benefits people in Alberta

Reality: Oil sands development benefits Canadians across the country through reliable energy supply, jobs, taxes and government revenues that help pay for services like roads, schools and hospitals.

The sector has contributed approximately $1 trillion to the Canadian economy over the past 25 years, according to analysis by the Macdonald-Laurier Institute (MLI).

That reflects total direct spending — including capital investment, operating costs, taxes and royalties — not profits or dividends for shareholders.

More than 2,300 companies outside of Alberta have had direct business with the oilsands, including over 1,300 in Ontario and almost 600 in Quebec, MLI said.

Energy products are by far Canada’s largest export, representing $196 billion, or about one-quarter of Canada’s total trade in 2024, according to Statistics Canada.

Led by the oil sands, Canada’s energy sector directly or indirectly employs more than 445,000 people across the country, according to Natural Resources Canada.",https://www.canadianenergycentre.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SAGD-wellpad-truck-1-1-1-1024x542.png,N,,2025-10-20 08:08:46.167002

Federal policy frameworks provide multiple pathways for supporting domestic antimony production revival through financial incentives, regulatory streamlining, and strategic procurement programmes.
Domestic antimony production revival will impact multiple industrial sectors, with defence and clean energy applications representing the highest-value opportunities.
Permitting Process Requirements Antimony mining operations face comprehensive federal and state environmental review processes that can extend project timelines significantly.
The transition from current pilot-scale operations to commercial us domestic antimony production restart involves multiple phases requiring careful coordination of technical, financial, and regulatory milestones.","The United States faces a critical vulnerability in its antimony supply chain that threatens both national security and economic stability. This strategic mineral, essential for defense applications and clean energy technologies, has left America entirely dependent on foreign sources since 2001, creating an urgent imperative for us domestic antimony production restart revival.

Critical Mineral Classification and National Security Implications

Antimony earned its place on the US Critical Minerals List in 2018 under Executive Order 13817, with reaffirmation in 2022 by the US Geological Survey. This designation reflects the mineral's dual nature of supply vulnerability and economic importance. The current 100% import dependency exposes American industries to geopolitical risks and supply disruptions that could cripple essential manufacturing sectors.

China's dominance in global antimony production, controlling approximately 55% of worldwide output at 60,000 metric tons annually, became particularly concerning following Beijing's announcement of export licensing requirements in August 2024. These restrictions, effective September 15, 2024, mirror previous Chinese actions with rare earth elements and demonstrated how quickly critical mineral access can become weaponized.

The strategic implications extend beyond immediate supply concerns. Furthermore, antimony price volatility following China's export control announcement saw costs surge from approximately $11,000 per metric ton in January 2024 to over $22,000 per metric ton by September 2024, representing a 100% increase that rippled through American manufacturing sectors.

Defense Industry Dependencies and Supply Chain Vulnerabilities

Military applications represent some of the most critical uses for antimony, with stringent quality requirements that cannot be easily substituted. The Department of Defense relies on antimony for multiple applications:

Ammunition manufacturing: Lead-antimony alloys containing 3-6% antimony provide necessary hardness for bullets and projectiles

Aircraft safety systems: Antimony trioxide serves as a flame retardant in military aircraft interior panels and wiring systems

Electronic warfare equipment: Antimony-based semiconductors enable night vision and infrared detection capabilities

The Pentagon's antimony consumption, while classified in specific quantities, likely reaches hundreds of metric tons annually for ammunition alone. This dependency on foreign sources creates operational risks that extend far beyond economic considerations, particularly in light of recent critical minerals order developments, potentially compromising military readiness and technological superiority.

Clean Energy Manufacturing Requirements

America's clean energy transition amplifies antimony demand across multiple sectors. Grid-scale energy storage systems increasingly rely on advanced lead-acid batteries containing 2-5% antimony to improve charging characteristics and operational longevity. Moreover, solar panel manufacturing requires antimony trioxide as a catalyst in polyethylene terephthalate (PET) production for protective backsheets.

The Inflation Reduction Act's emphasis on domestic clean energy manufacturing makes foreign antimony dependency particularly problematic. As battery production scales to support electric vehicle adoption and grid storage deployment, antimony requirements will grow substantially, making current import vulnerabilities increasingly untenable.

How Long Has America Relied on Foreign Antimony Sources?

America's antimony independence ended abruptly in 2001 with the closure of the Sunshine Mine in Idaho, marking the beginning of a 24-year period of complete foreign dependency that only recently showed signs of reversal.

The 2001 Sunshine Mine Closure and Its Lasting Impact

The Sunshine Mine's closure represented more than just another mining operation ending. As the last domestic antimony producer, generating 490 metric tons in its final year of operation, its shutdown eliminated America's ability to produce this critical mineral domestically. The closure resulted from a combination of factors including years of low commodity prices, foreign competition, and the lingering effects of the devastating 1972 fire that killed 91 miners.

Prior to closure, the mine had provided a crucial buffer against supply disruptions, but declining profitability made operations unsustainable. Foreign producers, particularly from China, offered antimony at prices that American operations could not match while maintaining profitable margins.

Import Dependency Statistics and Primary Source Countries

The evolution of American antimony dependency tells a story of gradual erosion followed by complete reliance on foreign sources:

Historical Dependency Timeline:

1980s: United States produced approximately 30% of domestic antimony needs

1990s: Domestic production declined to less than 10% of consumption

2001-present: Zero domestic mine production, 100% import reliant

Current import sources (2020-2023 average) reveal concerning concentration risks:

Source Country Import Share Annual Volume (MT) Strategic Risk Level China 35% ~12,000 High Belgium 24% ~8,400 Medium India 14% ~4,900 Medium Vietnam 8% ~2,800 Medium Others 19% ~6,650 Variable

Belgium's significant share represents processed antimony rather than primary production, as the country refines Chinese and other foreign concentrates. Consequently, actual dependency on Chinese sources exceeds the direct 35% figure.

Strategic Stockpile Depletion Concerns

The National Defense Stockpile previously provided a buffer against supply disruptions, holding approximately 27,000 metric tons of antimony during the 1990s. However, authorized sales reduced these holdings to less than 5,000 metric tons by 2020, eliminating much of America's strategic reserve capacity.

This depletion occurred during the same period when domestic production ceased, creating a perfect storm of vulnerability. Current stockpile levels provide minimal buffer against extended supply disruptions, particularly given annual US consumption of approximately 32,000-35,000 metric tons.

Which Companies Are Leading the US Domestic Antimony Production Revival?

The renaissance of American antimony production centers around three key players, each bringing distinct capabilities and timelines to market restoration efforts.

Locksley Resources' Mojave Desert Breakthrough

Australian-listed Locksley Resources (ASX: LKY) achieved a historic milestone in October 2025 by producing the first US-made antimony ingot in 24 years from their Mojave Desert operation in California. This breakthrough validates the complete mine-to-metal supply chain concept using domestically sourced ore refined at Hazen Research's metallurgical facilities in Colorado.

Key Locksley Achievements:

Successfully demonstrated ore extraction to refined metal production

Validated processing methodology for antimony trisulfide and trioxide production

Established partnership framework for scaling to commercial operations

Advanced toward pilot-scale production to confirm metallurgical recoveries

CEO Kerrie Matthews characterised this achievement as proof that sustainable commercial supply chains supporting America's industrial and defense sectors are not only possible but already underway. The company's focus now shifts from concept validation to commercial scaling, working closely with industry partners to ensure product specifications meet stringent US defense and industrial standards.

GreenMet, serving as Locksley's US-based advisor, provides crucial support for permitting and funding initiatives. CEO Drew Horn positioned Locksley as a pioneer in rebuilding America's antimony supply chain, representing precisely the outcome policymakers and industry leaders have sought for critical minerals domestic production.

United States Antimony Corporation's Integrated Operations

While specific current operational details require independent verification, United States Antimony Corporation represents another potential pillar in domestic antimony revival through integrated mining and processing capabilities. The company's approach focuses on creating vertically integrated operations from mine extraction through refined product delivery.

Sunshine Silver Mining & Refining's Revival Plans

Perhaps the most ambitious domestic antimony revival comes from Sunshine Silver Mining & Refining, planning to restart operations at the historic Idaho site where American antimony production originally ended. The private company's projections outline aggressive market capture goals:

Sunshine Revival Timeline:

2028 Target: Supply 40% of US annual antimony demand

2031 Goal: Potentially capture 80% of domestic market share

Infrastructure: Development of the country's only large-scale permitted antimony refinery

These projections, if realised, would dramatically alter America's antimony supply security. Capturing 40% of domestic demand by 2028 would represent approximately 13,000-14,000 metric tons annually, while 80% market share would reach 26,000-28,000 metric tons based on current consumption levels.

What Are the Technical Challenges in Restarting Domestic Production?

Reviving American antimony production after 24 years presents complex metallurgical, operational, and quality control challenges that extend far beyond simply reopening closed facilities.

Metallurgical Recovery Optimisation

Antimony typically occurs as stibnite (Sb2S3), requiring sophisticated processing to achieve commercial-grade purity levels. Traditional processing involves roasting stibnite to antimony trioxide, followed by carbon reduction to metallic antimony. Recovery rates typically range from 85-95% depending on ore characteristics and processing methodology.

Locksley's breakthrough with Hazen Research demonstrates successful processing methodology, but scaling from proof-of-concept to commercial volumes requires extensive optimisation. Key technical parameters include:

Temperature control: Precise roasting temperatures to maximise recovery while minimising impurities

Atmosphere management: Controlling oxidising conditions during processing stages

Impurity removal: Achieving defence-grade specifications requiring 99.5% minimum purity

Energy efficiency: Optimising fuel consumption and processing costs for commercial viability

Processing Efficiency Scaling Requirements

Moving from pilot-scale to commercial production presents exponential complexity increases. Processing facilities must maintain consistent quality while handling significantly larger ore volumes. Critical scaling factors include:

Infrastructure Requirements:

Ore handling and preparation systems capable of processing hundreds of tons daily

Roasting furnaces with precise temperature and atmosphere control

Refining capabilities to remove arsenic, lead, and copper impurities

Environmental controls for sulfur dioxide emissions management

Product Quality Standards for Defence Applications

Defence applications demand the highest antimony purity levels, typically requiring 99.5% minimum purity for metallic antimony and 99.0% minimum for antimony trioxide. These specifications leave minimal margin for processing variations, requiring sophisticated quality control systems.

Critical Quality Parameters:

Arsenic content below 0.06% for flame retardant applications

Controlled lead and copper impurities for battery alloy applications

Consistent particle size distribution for industrial applications

Trace element analysis meeting military specifications

How Does Domestic Production Compare to Global Supply Chains?

American antimony production revival occurs within a global market dominated by established players offering significant cost advantages and proven supply chains.

China's Market Dominance and Export Restrictions

China's 60,000 metric tons annual production represents 55% of global antimony output, creating overwhelming market influence. Chinese producers benefit from multiple competitive advantages:

Lower labour costs: Significantly reduced operational expenses compared to US standards

Established infrastructure: Decades of processing facility development and optimisation

Economies of scale: Large-volume production spreading fixed costs across higher output

Integrated supply chains: Vertical integration from mining through refined product delivery

China's August 2024 export licensing requirements demonstrate how quickly supply chains can be disrupted. These controls, similar to previous rare earth restrictions, signal Beijing's willingness to use antimony as a geopolitical tool.

Alternative International Sources and Their Limitations

Beyond China, global antimony production comes from several countries with varying degrees of supply reliability:

Country Annual Production (MT) Market Share Supply Reliability Russia 18,000 16% Low (sanctions) Tajikistan 13,000 12% Medium Myanmar 10,000 9% Low (instability) Others 9,000 8% Variable

Russia's production faces ongoing sanctions complications, while Myanmar's political instability creates supply uncertainty. Tajikistan offers more reliable access but limited production scale. These alternatives cannot fully replace Chinese supplies without significant market disruption.

Cost Competitiveness Analysis

American antimony production faces substantial cost challenges compared to established international suppliers. Key cost factors include:

US Production Disadvantages:

Higher labour costs reflecting American wage standards

Stringent environmental compliance requirements increasing operational expenses

New infrastructure capital requirements for facility development

Smaller initial production scales limiting cost distribution advantages

Offsetting Advantages:

Transportation cost savings eliminating $500-800 per metric ton shipping expenses

Supply chain security premium valued by defence contractors

Reduced inventory carrying costs from shorter supply chains

Potential government support through various incentive programmes

What Government Policies Support Antimony Production Restart?

Federal policy frameworks provide multiple pathways for supporting domestic antimony production revival through financial incentives, regulatory streamlining, and strategic procurement programmes.

Critical Minerals List Designation Impact

Antimony's inclusion on the US Critical Minerals List since 2018, reaffirmed in 2022, unlocks access to various federal support mechanisms. This designation enables:

Expedited permitting: FAST-41 streamlined environmental review processes

Financial incentives: Access to advanced manufacturing production credits under the Inflation Reduction Act

Loan guarantees: Department of Energy Title XVII authority for critical mineral projects

Research support: Federal funding for metallurgical and processing research initiatives

Defence Production Act Potential Applications

The Defence Production Act (DPA) Title III provides DOD authority to financially support domestic critical material production. While no specific antimony funding has been publicly announced as of late 2024, the precedent exists through $285 million in DPA Title III funding awarded for rare earth processing in 2023.

Potential DPA Support Mechanisms:

Purchase commitments providing revenue certainty for new operations

Infrastructure development funding for processing facilities

Technology development grants for metallurgical optimisation

Workforce training support for specialised mining and processing skills

Tax Incentives and Regulatory Streamlining

Multiple federal and state mechanisms could support antimony production development:

Investment tax credits: Manufacturing credits potentially applicable to antimony processing facilities

As battery manufacturing scales to support the Inflation Reduction Act's clean energy goals, antimony requirements will grow substantially, making domestic supply increasingly valuable for supply chain security through energy transition security.

Industrial Manufacturing Sectors

Beyond defence and energy applications, antimony serves essential roles across diverse industrial sectors representing significant market opportunities.

Primary Industrial Uses (2023 consumption breakdown):

Flame retardants: 45% of US antimony consumption in plastics, textiles, and electronics

Lead-acid batteries: 25% for automotive and industrial applications

Chemicals and ceramics: 15% for catalyst and glass production applications

Other applications: 15% including paints, adhesives, and specialised alloys

The flame retardant market alone represents approximately 15,000-16,000 metric tons annually, with applications ranging from building materials to consumer electronics requiring consistent supply reliability.

What Are the Environmental Considerations for Domestic Mining?

Restarting antimony production requires navigating complex environmental regulations while addressing community concerns about mining impacts and long-term sustainability.

Permitting Process Requirements

Antimony mining operations face comprehensive federal and state environmental review processes that can extend project timelines significantly. Key regulatory requirements include:

Federal Oversight:

Environmental Impact Statements under National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)

Clean Air Act permits for processing facility emissions

Clean Water Act compliance for mine water management

Endangered Species Act consultations for habitat impacts

State-Level Requirements:

Mining permits and reclamation bonding

Air quality permits for roasting and smelting operations

Water discharge permits and groundwater protection plans

Waste management approvals for processing residues

The FAST-41 permitting process available to critical mineral projects can streamline some review timelines, but comprehensive environmental compliance remains essential for project success in line with domestic production order requirements.

Environmental Impact Mitigation Strategies

Modern antimony processing requires sophisticated environmental controls to meet current regulatory standards while maintaining community acceptance.

Critical Environmental Controls:

Air emissions: Sulfur dioxide capture systems for roasting operations preventing acid rain formation

Water management: Closed-loop processing systems minimising freshwater consumption and discharge

Waste handling: Safe storage and disposal of processing residues containing trace heavy metals

Habitat protection: Minimising surface disturbance and implementing progressive reclamation programmes

Community Engagement and Stakeholder Concerns

Successful antimony production revival requires proactive engagement with local communities, indigenous tribes, and environmental organisations. Key stakeholder concerns include:

Economic benefits: Local employment opportunities and tax revenue generation

Environmental protection: Long-term impacts on air quality, water resources, and wildlife habitat

Cultural considerations: Protection of historical sites and traditional land uses

Transportation impacts: Increased truck traffic and infrastructure wear on local roads

How Will Domestic Production Affect Antimony Market Pricing?

American antimony production revival will introduce new pricing dynamics while potentially stabilising supply costs for domestic consumers.

Current Import Price Volatility Factors

Antimony pricing demonstrates extreme volatility driven by geopolitical events and supply disruptions. The 100% price increase from $11,000 to $22,000 per metric ton following China's export control announcement illustrates this vulnerability.

Primary Volatility Drivers:

Geopolitical tensions: Trade disputes and export restrictions create sudden supply gaps

Transportation costs: Shipping expenses from China add $500-800 per metric ton

Currency fluctuations: Dollar strength affects import costs from various suppliers

Inventory speculation: Market participants adjusting stocks based on supply concerns

Domestic Production Cost Structure Analysis

American antimony production will likely operate at higher base costs than Chinese competitors but offer offsetting advantages through supply security and transportation savings.

Expected Cost Components:

Mining operations: Higher labour costs offset by modern equipment efficiency

Processing facilities: Substantial capital requirements but potential economies from integrated operations

Environmental compliance: Additional costs for emission controls and waste management

Transportation savings: Elimination of international shipping and reduced inventory requirements

Long-term Price Stabilisation Projections

Domestic production capacity representing 40-80% of US demand by 2031 could significantly stabilise antimony pricing by reducing import dependency and providing supply security.

Stabilisation Mechanisms:

Supply diversification: Reduced reliance on single-source imports

Strategic buffering: Domestic production providing emergency supply capacity

Contract pricing: Long-term supply agreements with defence contractors

Market competition: Domestic alternatives constraining import price volatility

Economic Impact Projections:

Estimated jobs created: 500-1,500 direct positions across mining and processing operations

Regional investment: $50-100 million initial capital requirements for facility development

Import substitution value: $200+ million annually based on current consumption levels

A case before Michigan's energy regulators could set the course for the construction of new data centers across Michigan.
If data centers use water to cool their computer systems via evaporation, that means the water does not necessarily return to the watershed.
Still, even a few data centers could reshape a utility's operations by surging demand for electricity.
They, along with the Michigan Attorney General's office, consumer advocacy groups and a data center industry group, are among those who have intervened in Consumers' data center case before the MPSC.","Technology companies have set their sights on vast swaths of land in Michigan in their race to build data centers — energy-hungry facilities that power artificial intelligence, movie streaming, web browsing and other online tools.

Leaders of both DTE Energy and Consumers Energy, the state's two major regulated, investor-owned utilities, have told shareholders that multiple large data centers have expressed interest in building in Michigan. If built, those data centers would significantly increase demand for energy and lead the companies to build more electric sources, the company leaders said.

As utility leaders field inquiries from the tech sector, environmental groups and some ratepayers fear rapid data center development could send their electric bills skyrocketing and hamper the state's transition away from fossil fuels.

""There is a real risk here that if it's done improperly, residential customers will pay for the AI boom, to support power needs (of tech companies), without a clear benefit,"" said Daniel Abrams, senior associate attorney at the Environmental Law and Policy Center.

""This is a really important moment in time.""

Tech company executives, other consumers and analysts noted that data centers are critical to powering increasing demands in the digital economy and can fuel the creation of good-paying jobs.

""States that can effectively plan, manage, and mitigate the risks of data center growth stand to unlock millions, perhaps even billions, of dollars in direct and indirect growth. At the same time, they can create high-paying jobs and establish themselves as leading digital-infrastructure hubs,"" according to an August report by management consulting firm McKinsey & Co.

Already, there are at least 50 data centers operating in Michigan, according to Data Center Map, an online database tracking the facilities. More are in various stages of development.

At least three data centers are planned in Washtenaw County alone, including a $1.25 billion ""high performance computational facility"" proposed by the University of Michigan and Los Alamos National Laboratory. There is another in Saline Township that was approved after its developer, Related Digital, sued the town over officials' initial decision to oppose its rezoning request.

Another facility is proposed in Livingston County's Howell Township. The Livingston County Planning Commission is scheduled to hear a request to rezone 25 parcels from the developer in November, township zoning administrator Jonathan Hohenstein said. The company behind the development told the township it would disclose itself once a plan is approved, according to its rezoning request.

A case before Michigan's energy regulators could set the course for the construction of new data centers across Michigan.

Consumers Energy asked the Michigan Public Service Commission for permission to add provisions specific to data centers to the tariffs, or contracts, the company drafts with industrial customers. The company wants to require new data centers to operate for at least 15 years, use at least 80% of the energy they say they will use and pay a fee for ending contracts early.

Those measures would help avoid a scenario in which Consumers Energy builds out its grid to service a promised data center that only operates for a year, leaving the company with power-generating infrastructure that nobody needs, but everybody has to pay for.

""This proposal is designed to protect customers from potential stranded costs associated with data center loads,"" Consumers spokesman Brian Wheeler said in an emailed statement. ""Consumers Energy is planning to serve data centers on MPSC-approved, cost of service based rates, which will ensure they pay the costs of providing service to them.""

Environmental groups said Consumers Energy's proposal doesn't go far enough to protect ratepayers and ensure the state continues its movement toward powering the grid with clean energy. In contrast, an industry group representing data center owners and operators contended the proposal would pull the rug out from under the burgeoning industry and send development to other states.

The ""extreme recommendations … would force large load customers to bear an intolerable level of risk,"" wrote the attorneys for the Data Center Coalition, a Virginia-based group of data center owners and operators, in a September filing to the Public Service Commission.

Environmental groups have also raised concerns about data centers' water use. Computers get hot, and cooling them requires using either water or electricity. The Alliance for the Great Lakes, a Chicago nonprofit that advocates for Great Lakes protection, issued a report in August that said large data centers can use each day between 1 million gallons — about as much as 12,000 Americans use in a day — and 5 million gallons.

If data centers use water to cool their computer systems via evaporation, that means the water does not necessarily return to the watershed. Other cooling methods release contaminants or use more electricity, according to the report.

The Alliance for Great Lakes recommended that the states conduct water demand studies to understand their supply, require data centers to disclose their expected water use and report the amount of water they actually use.

""Without careful planning, it could have unintended consequences, like depleting groundwater availability in existing private drinking water wells and wells used for agricultural irrigation,"" the report stated.

Centers may require doubling of power supply

The potential expansion of electricity demand as a result of data center development is staggering. The facilities need power to operate their computational equipment as well as keep the facility cool, a task that can also be done using water.

Consumers Energy alone has fielded so many inquiries from data center developers that the utility would have to nearly triple its peak load — the amount of energy it takes to supply its customers at times of maximum demand — if each request came to fruition. In its application for an amended tariff, Consumers said the company had fielded inquiries that totaled more than 15 gigawatts of electric load. This means the peak load would reach 23 gigawatts, up from Consumers' current peak load of about 8 gigawatts.

DTE Energy CEO Joi Harris told shareholders in July that the company is in ""advanced discussions"" with multiple large data centers for more than three gigawatts of new load and is in ""ongoing discussions"" with multiple other data center operators for an additional four gigawatts. The utility's current peak load is approximately 10 gigawatts.

Data center developers want to take advantage of the exemption on sales and use taxes Michigan lawmakers approved last year, which lasts through 2028, Harris said.

It isn't likely that every tech company inquiry about locating a data center in a utility's service territory will lead to a data center actually coming online. Analysts agree that tech companies are probably sending inquiries to many utility companies in multiple states. Still, even a few data centers could reshape a utility's operations by surging demand for electricity.

A surge in demand means a surge in the development of energy production and storage, which requires a surge in money.

The stakes are high. Data centers use exorbitant amounts of energy, so adding one to a utility's service territory is expensive. The Michigan Attorney General's Office estimated Consumers Energy would have to spend nearly $500 million to serve a new 100-megawatt data center, according to filings submitted to the Public Service Commission.

The costs are largely in two categories: building enough new power sources to supply the data center, which state attorneys estimate would cost approximately $400 million, and connecting the data center to Consumers' transmission grid, which they estimated would cost $46.5 million and $96 million.

That brings the final estimated tally for a single, 100-megawatt data center to between $446.5 million and $496 million.

Those estimates are for a hypothetical 100 megawatt data center. Consumers Energy announced this summer it had signed an agreement to connect a data center that could add up to 1 gigawatt of demand — an order of magnitude larger than the one state attorneys estimated would cost almost $500 million to put on the grid.

The Natural Resources Defense Council said a 1-gigawatt data center would demand as much energy as almost 1 million U.S. homes.

That's why the details in the tariff case being hashed out before the Public Service Commission are important, said Lee Shaver, senior energy analyst for the Union of Concerned Scientists, a Massachusetts nonprofit that advocates for science-based public policy.

""The other regulated utilities are going to be paying attention, and they might file something similar,"" Shaver said. ""Data centers are also watching.""

DTE Energy has not filed a tariff case but is monitoring how other utilities and public service commissions address data center rates, spokesman Ryan Lowry said.

DTE has excess capacity and could begin to serve some data centers quickly with its mix of electricity from renewable sources, natural gas and battery storage, Lowry said. The company could have to build new energy generation sources depending on data center demand, he said.

DTE plans to retire the coal-fired Monroe Power Plant in 2032. The company is exploring options for replacing that baseload power by expanding its nuclear power fleet, which currently includes just the Fermi 2 plant in Frenchtown Township, as well as expanding its use of natural gas paired with carbon capture and sequestration, Lowry said.

Data center groups object to contract terms

Environmental groups, including the Union of Concerned Scientists, want to ensure large data centers don't affect the cost or reliability of electricity in Michigan or extend the use of fossil fuels to power the grid, Shaver said. They, along with the Michigan Attorney General's office, consumer advocacy groups and a data center industry group, are among those who have intervened in Consumers' data center case before the MPSC.

The environmental groups are pushing the Public Service Commission to require Consumers to factor clean energy into their agreements with data centers and require Consumers to prioritize serving data centers that supply some of their own clean electricity and can limit the amount of power on days when demand is high. That will help limit how much electricity Consumers would have to supply on peak-demand days.

The groups also are advocating for the commission to require data centers to generate some of their own clean electricity or pay for the electricity sources utilities build to serve them, Shaver said.

""If the utilities aren't doing a good job allocating costs in their rates, every time they file for increased rates, that fixed portion of residential customers' bill is going to go up, and they're going to be subsidizing a data center,"" Shaver said. ""That becomes a huge issue if a data center doesn’t materialize. Utility builds all the infrastructure, then the customer never comes, then everyone else is left holding the bag.""

The Michigan Attorney General's Office similarly is pushing the commission to require more stringent terms for data centers. The Attorney General's Office wants Consumers' tariffs to apply to smaller data centers than the utility company proposed and to require data center developers to pay more of the cost of project planning, new energy generation and connection.

State attorneys also estimated what it would cost Consumers to serve a new, 100-megawatt data center — nearly $500 million, according to filings submitted to the commission. Consumers' proposed tariff terms would not guarantee that a data center customer makes up for those upfront costs, the state attorneys argued in their initial brief.

""Under Consumers’ proposed tariff amendments, the guaranteed revenue from new data center customers would not meet even the non-complete cost estimate outlined above,"" the Attorney General's Office wrote.

The Data Center Coalition noted in its September filing that the terms Consumers proposed are ""a striking departure from the status quo."" Other industrial customers are not obligated to agree to such terms, the coalition said.

While the coalition's attorneys said they generally agree to making those commitments, they said Consumers, the commission staff and environmental groups' proposals go too far and would make Michigan an outlier compared with other states.

""This would discourage data centers and other large loads from locating in the Company’s service territory, undermining the legislature's clear intent when it enacted a sales and use tax exemption for data centers late last year.""

California oil production has been waning since the 1980s and has more recently been pinched by the push for cleaner forms of energy.","Thousands flock to its parade of cowboys on horseback, antique cars and floats featuring oil pumps -- a hat tip to the Wild West of yore.

This year, nine months into Donald Trump's second term, the tone has shifted from reminiscence to renaissance.

Shrugging off climate change concerns, the US president has embraced fossil fuels with a stated goal of ""unleashing American energy"" and removing ""impediments"" to domestic energy production.

Some of Taft's 7,000 residents are anticipating a comeback for the petroleum industry in California, which has pledged to abandon oil drilling by 2045 to meet its climate goals.

""I'm 100 percent satisfied with President Trump,"" Buddy Binkley told AFP, a minority view in a heavily Democratic state. ""And as for the state of California, I think he's putting a nice pressure on them to hopefully turn around their prejudice against oil.""

The 64-year-old retired maintenance supervisor with oil company Chevron sported a red cap with the words ""Make Oil Great Again,"" a play on Trump's MAGA motto and a slogan featured on several parade floats.

""The oil industry in California is suffering due to political reasons,"" Binkley said. But with Trump in power, ""I think it may go back the way it was.""

'Great hopes'

Located about 200 kilometers (120 miles) north of Los Angeles, Taft was founded in 1910 atop California's most extensive oil field.

Today, Kern County -- where Taft is located -- contributes more than 70 percent of California's total oil production. Its rural landscape is dotted with thousands of oil pumps.

A giant wooden oil derrick serves as a central landmark in Taft, which finances its schools, fire department and police force with oil revenues.

Festival-goers can compete for the title of best welder, crane operator or backhoe loader -- or be crowned the ""Oildorado Queen.""

Despite its pageantry and pride, the town is in decline.

California oil production has been waning since the 1980s and has more recently been pinched by the push for cleaner forms of energy. Some of the town's residents have moved to Texas, where drilling is less regulated.

Many in Taft are delighted that Trump has pulled out of the Paris climate accord and removed obstacles to drilling on federal lands while handing out billions in tax breaks for the oil industry.

""I have great hopes,"" said Dave Noerr, Taft's mayor. ""We have all the raw materials. We had the wrong direction, now we have leadership that is going to unleash the possibilities.""

'Stuck in the past'

Trump's administration has slashed federal funding for renewable energy and climate science, and he wants to strip the Environmental Protection Agency of its power to regulate greenhouse gas emissions.

Like the president, Noerr is a skeptic of ""quote, unquote, climate change.""

""We need to question the narrative, and we need to update those things with the existing science,"" he said.

Yet California is increasingly vulnerable to the extreme weather produced by climate change. Earlier this year, 31 people in the Los Angeles area died in fires spread by hurricane-force gusts of 160 km/h (100 miles per hour).

""If everyone around the world behaved like the US, the world would be on pace for four degrees centigrade of global warming by 2100,"" said Paasha Mahdavi, a political scientist specializing in environmental policy at the University of California, Santa Barbara.

Agriculture remains the top employer in Kern County, and ""would be dramatically affected by increased incidence of drought, and unprecedented heat waves that are already hitting the region,"" he added.

That worries Taylor Pritchett, a 31-year-old dog groomer in Taft who frets about air pollution in the area.

""If I were to have a child, I wouldn't want to raise them in Kern County,"" she said. ""I would like to go somewhere cleaner.""

She believes that ""we need to get away from fossil fuels."" But in Taft, she acknowledged, ""we're stuck in the past a little bit, you know, like, very unwilling to change.""

Zacks Investment Research","Tesla Earnings Are Due Wednesday

Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock Tesla (TSLA), the worldwide electric vehicle (EV) leader and a dynamic technology innovator, will report third-quarter 2025 earnings after the market close on Wednesday, October 22nd. Though Tesla has been one of the top-performing stocks since its IPO in July 2010 (with a 34,000% return), the stock has taken investors on a wild ride over the past few years. Namely, Tesla has had to weather new tariff policies, a slowing EV market, higher interest rates, and increased competition. Additionally, Tesla and its iconic but controversial CEO, Elon Musk, have faced intense political backlash from both sides of the political aisle. Despite its many challenges, TSLA shares are up a robust 93% over the past six months.

Tesla EPS Preview

Below are some key details to know ahead of Tesla’s earnings:

Tesla Consensus Analyst Estimates

Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest tepid sales growth and negative EPS growth until 2026. Wall Street expects Q3 revenue of $26.45B (+5.05%), with EPS of $0.53 (-26.39%).

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research

Tesla EPS Surprise History

Tesla has delivered spotty earnings results recently. Despite tempered Tesla analyst expectations, Tesla has missed expectations in six of the past ten quarters.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research

Meanwhile, Tesla has missed analyst expectations by an average of 3.65% over the past four quarters.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research

TSLA Expected Move

The options market implies a potential move of +/- $37.48 or an 8.53% implied move. Tesla has had an average move of +/- 10.53% over the past eight quarters. TSLA shares have been higher the day after EPS 50% of the time over that time.

TSLA Technical View

After breaking out from a low-level base structure in September, TSLA shares are coiling in a classic bull flag pattern. If Tesla exceeds expectations, the stock should make a run at its previous all-time high of $488. Should TSLA miss expectations, the stock is likely to test the confluence of the open price gap and rising 50-day moving average ~$400.

Tesla EPS: 3 Key Catalysts

Tesla’s post-earnings price action will likely be determined by the answer to three critical questions, including:

1. Has Tesla’s Legacy EV Business Bottomed? Tesla recently produced and announced a record number of vehicle deliveries. However, investors will be listening closely to see what Elon Musk and his team have to say about forward expectations in the wake of the removal of federal EV tax credits, lower interest rates, and the new ‘Model Y’ sales performance.

2. Will Energy Segment Growth Continue? In the absence of a growing EV business, Tesla Energy has been a bastion of growth. Last year, the segment grew at a robust 67%. Meanwhile, thus far in 2025, energy storage deployments have increased at a triple-digit pace. With the AI boom in full force, Tesla’s energy storage business should benefit as energy-hungry data centers require energy storage solutions like Tesla’s ‘Megapack.’

3. Will Tesla Meet Timelines for FSD, Robotaxis, and Optimus? Elon Musk is well-known for his aggressive timelines for new products. However, if Musk can convince investors that future product roadmaps are still on track, investors will reward him.

Bottom Line

As Tesla prepares to report Q3 earnings, investors face a familiar mix of excitement and uncertainty. With the stock surging nearly 93% in the past six months, expectations are high – yet tempered by Tesla’s recent mixed track record.

Project to create 200 jobs during construction and others during 30-year operation

Part of the State Government's $6.4 billion investment in renewable energy infrastructure

Construction has started on the 105-megawatt King Rocks Wind Farm, a Synergy led renewable energy project that is part of the Cook Government's clean energy transition for Western Australia.

Workers have been mobilised, and earthworks have started at the site, 35km north-east of Hyden.

King Rocks Wind Farm will feature 17 wind turbines and will generate enough power for up to 70,000 homes.

The project will also involve construction of associated infrastructure such as roads, transmission lines and substation facilities.

Towers up to 125m with turbine blades of up to 80m long take the total height of each wind turbine to about 206m.

The Cook Labor Government has committed $513 million towards the project.

The wind farm will provide an economic boost to the region by creating about 200 jobs during construction, with other jobs during operations over the next 30 years.

This is in addition to more than 30 jobs created through the construction of Synergy's Hyden Workers' Accommodation built nearby.

The facility will feature 189 temporary rooms and associated facilities. The first workers are using the facility.

The Government has invested $6.4 billion on renewable energy infrastructure since 2017.

King Rocks Wind Farm is being delivered by State-owned Synergy and is expected to be completed in 2027.

Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said the new plan places Scotland “at the very heart of the clean energy revolution”.

The Government said Scotland will see up to 60,000 jobs in greener energy by 2030 – a 40,000 increase from 2023.

Across the UK, it expects employment to double to 860,000 by the end of the decade, including nuclear energy.

It said 31 “priority occupations” had been identified for the switch away from fossil fuels, including plumbers, electricians and welders.

As part of the transition, the Scottish Government said on Sunday it would jointly invest £18m with the UK Government to enable thousands of North Sea workers to access tailored support to make the change to more sustainable energy.

UK ministers said their new plans include proposals to ensure people in these jobs have “world-class pay, terms and conditions”.

They said this includes closing loopholes to extend employment protections enjoyed by offshore oil and gas workers working beyond UK territorial seas.

Initiatives were also announced to encourage more veterans, ex-offenders and unemployed people into the sector.

“The clean energy jobs boom can answer that call – and today we publish a landmark national plan to make it happen and places Scotland at the very heart of the clean energy revolution this Government is delivering.

“Our plans will help create an economy in which there is no need to leave your home town just to find a decent job.

“Thanks to this Government’s commitment to clean energy a generation of young people in Scotland can have well-paid secure jobs, from plumbers to electricians and welders.

“This is a pro-worker, pro-jobs, pro-union agenda that will deliver the national renewal our country needs.”

Scottish Energy Secretary Gillian Martin said: “Scotland’s innovation, expertise and vast renewable energy resources will not only benefit the planet, but deliver new economic opportunities and new jobs for households and communities across the country.

“This continued and expanded funding to the Oil and Gas Transition Training Fund will support more offshore workers to take on different roles across the sustainable energy sector over the next three years – helping to deliver a fair and managed transition to the sector.

“We will continue to explore how best to support Scotland’s energy skills transition, working closely with the UK Government on options like guaranteed interview schemes, redeployment pools and skills passporting.”

Scottish Secretary Douglas Alexander added: “From offshore wind to carbon capture, Scotland is uniquely positioned to lead our clean energy revolution with world-class resources and skilled workers.

“Harnessing the potential of clean energy is an unmistakable example of how the UK Government is delivering for Scotland.

“These 40,000 new opportunities will benefit a generation of young people across Scotland and represent a pivotal moment in our mission to boost economic growth across all parts of the UK.

“The clean energy jobs boom can answer that call – and today we publish a landmark national plan to make it happen and places Scotland at the very heart of the clean energy revolution this Government is delivering.

“Our plans will help create an economy in which there is no need to leave your home town just to find a decent job.

Scottish Energy Secretary Gillian Martin said: “Scotland’s innovation, expertise and vast renewable energy resources will not only benefit the planet – but deliver new economic opportunities and new jobs for households and communities across the country.

“This continued and expanded funding to the Oil and Gas Transition Training Fund will support more offshore workers to take on different roles across the sustainable energy sector over the next three years – helping to deliver a fair and managed transition to the sector.

“We will continue to explore how best to support Scotland’s energy skills transition, working closely with the UK Government on options like guaranteed interview schemes, redeployment pools and skills passporting.”

Scottish Secretary Douglas Alexander added: “From offshore wind to carbon capture, Scotland is uniquely positioned to lead our clean energy revolution with world-class resources and skilled workers.

“Harnessing the potential of clean energy is an unmistakable example of how the UK Government is delivering for Scotland.

“These 40,000 new opportunities will benefit a generation of young people across Scotland and represent a pivotal moment in our mission to boost economic growth across all parts of the UK.

“This UK Government is putting money directly into the pockets of hardworking Scots.

“This comes alongside Great British Energy’s launch in Aberdeen, which is already unlocking significant investment and helping to create skilled jobs as we make Britain a clean energy superpower.”

The investment will increase the automaker’s annual US vehicle production by 50% and create more than 5000 new jobs across plants in Illinois, Ohio, Michigan and Indiana. The expansion will support five new vehicle launches and 19 product refreshes through 2029.

“This investment in the U.S. – the single largest in the Company’s history – will drive our growth, strengthen our manufacturing footprint and bring more American jobs to the states we call home,” Stellantis chief executive and North America COO Antonio Filosa says.

The company plans to reopen its Belvidere Assembly Plant in Illinois with a $600 million investment to produce the Jeep Cherokee and Jeep Compass for the US market. Production is expected to begin in 2027, creating around 3300 new jobs.

Plant investments across four states

In Ohio, Stellantis will invest nearly $400 million to move production of an all-new midsize truck to the Toledo Assembly Complex, where it will join the Jeep Wrangler and Jeep Gladiator. The production shift is expected to create more than 900 jobs, with launch timing planned for 2028.

The Warren Truck Assembly Plant in Michigan will receive nearly $100 million to produce an all-new range-extended electric vehicle (EV) and internal combustion engine large SUV beginning in 2028. The new program is anticipated to add more than 900 jobs to the facility, which currently assembles the Jeep Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer.

Stellantis also plans to invest $130 million to prepare the Detroit Assembly Complex for production of the next-generation Dodge Durango, with production anticipated to launch in 2029.

In Indiana, the company will invest more than $100 million in its Kokomo facilities to produce the all-new four-cylinder GMET4 EVO engine beginning in 2026, adding more than 100 jobs.

Filosa says accelerating growth in the US has been a top priority since taking the role. “Success in America is not just good for Stellantis in the U.S. — it makes us stronger everywhere,” he says.

The announcement represents a stark contrast to Australia’s automotive manufacturing landscape, where local vehicle production ended in 2017 with the closure of the last Holden plant. While Australia once hosted significant automotive manufacturing operations from General Motors, Ford and Toyota, the country now relies entirely on vehicle imports.

Stellantis’ US footprint includes 34 manufacturing facilities, parts distribution centres and research and development locations across 14 states, supporting more than 48,000 employees, 2600 dealers and nearly 2300 suppliers.

EV Tax Credits By State (Tax Foundation) Tax Foundation","The federal gravy train for EV buyers has reached the end of the line. As of September 30, 2025, Uncle Sam officially stopped footing the bill for your next electric car, causing concern among automakers about plummeting demand.

However, that doesn’t necessarily mean there’s no help available. Depending on where you live, your state might still have you covered with its own tax credits scheme.

Who’s Still Paying Up?

But some states are downright stingy with their cash, meaning there’s no one-size-fits-all discount like the old $7,500 federal aid. According to new data from the Tax Foundation, the state-level landscape is a messy patchwork of perks, penalties, and paperwork.

While some states are still rolling out the red carpet for EVs, others are quietly slapping owners with new registration fees to make up for lost gas-tax revenue, highlighting how different attitudes are to green policies across the country.

A few states remain firmly on the side of the buyer, including Colorado, which from this November will provide rebates of up to $9,000 to low and middle-income families trading in an old gas car for a new electric vehicle, and as much as $6,000 on a used one.

Oregon and Maine both offer $7,500 of credits, Oklahoma gives up to $5,500, and Connecticut and Vermont will cut the price of your EV by $5,000. Illinois, Kansas and New Jersey make $4,000 available and various other states will throw in between $1,500 and $3,500 to encourage you to go electric.

Where EVs Cost You More

Then there are the less friendly states. Georgia has no EV incentives at all and charges drivers $235 per year just to register their electric vehicle. Indiana is arguably even worse: it also has no EV incentives, charges $230 to register one, and $77 to register a hybrid.

Perhaps surprisingly, given its history of leading on green matters, California no longer offers state help for EV buyers. Governor Gavin Newsom recently claimed it wasn’t economically viable to offer aid right now, though his office has since suggested a scheme might be introduced next year.

Some states don’t simply rely on EV registration fees to help offset lost gas revenue, but also add tax to the cost of charging at public charging stations. Those states include Georgia, Iowa, Kentucky and Oklahoma, the Tax Foundation reports, while also noting the flaw in their plan: drivers who charge at home escape the duty.

The takeaway here is that the government taking federal tax credits off the table doesn’t necessarily mean you can no longer afford that EV. You just need to check out where your state stands on the issue.

“The US support was a catalyst for additional Canadian government support.” Mining companies will welcome investment wherever it comes from, given how hard it is to raise funds, Fasken’s Tóth noted.
Rare earths The US has also broadened its footprint in critical minerals and rare earth projects through new equity, contract and grant support.
Northern Dynasty Minerals (TSX: NDM; NYSE-A: NAK) is challenging in court the US Environmental Protection Agency’s veto of the project.
“It’s good for government to get behind mining projects,” Fasken’s Tóth said.","The Trump administration is ratcheting up government ownership in mining companies that are nominally Canadian, raising questions about whether Ottawa plans similar investments.

Trump has ordered his Department of War to take a 10% stake in Trilogy Metals (TSX, NYSE American: TMQ) and help fund South32 (ASX, LSE, JSE: S32), joint partners of the Arctic copper-zinc project in Alaska. That follows a 5% US government stake announced this month in Lithium Americas (TSX, NYSE: LAC), which is developing the $3 billion Thacker Pass project in Nevada. Trilogy and Lithium Americas are based in Vancouver.

“The funny part is, they’re not Canadian because all their assets are in the United States, so are they Canadian? Are they American?” says Krisztián Tóth, a partner at Toronto-based law firm Fasken who focuses on mining financing and cross-border transactions. “The national security aspect of this has not been examined fully, but that’s really what it goes to anyway.”

The American government investing in Canadian companies isn’t new – that goes back to the Second World War with funding for Quebec aluminum plants – and the Biden administration earmarked millions for projects in Canada through clean energy and transition metals funding. However, Trump officials are promoting direct ownership, which has elated some mining industry players while others urge caution.

Canada has a more nuanced approach, at least on paper so far. Prime Minister Mark Carney has opened a Major Projects Office to fast-track energy and mining projects, but he’s stopped short of seeking equity stakes in projects, although the government under his predecessor did buy a gas pipeline to help build it. Carney also makes sure to mention that environmental and Indigenous concerns will be addressed amid government support.

Northwest Territories

Fortune Minerals (TSX: FT), developing the NICO cobalt-gold-bismuth-copper project in the Northwest Territories with a refinery in Alberta, received $6.4 million last year from the Pentagon as part of a total $17 million from governments on both sides of the border. The project has the world’s largest deposit of bismuth, which is used in products such as Pepto Bismol.

“The validation and combined support from the governments have allowed the project to move forward during a challenging environment at a quicker pace than would have been possible with support from only one government,” Fortune President and CEO Robin Goad said in an emailed reply to questions. “The US support was a catalyst for additional Canadian government support.”

Mining companies will welcome investment wherever it comes from, given how hard it is to raise funds, Fasken’s Tóth noted. But he urged Ottawa to revise its policy on foreign investment, like how it has been applied to the Chinese. Canada has ordered China-controlled businesses to divest from Canadian companies even when the mineral assets were abroad.

“I echo the words of Ronald Reagan: ‘The most dangerous words you’re ever going to hear is, I’m the government, and I’m here to help,’” Tóth said in a phone interview.

“As long as there’s a free market and the government doesn’t artificially keep out other potential investors, then it’s healthy for the government to also want to invest in projects. I would prefer there would be more Canadian-based projects than foreign projects, just because we should be developing our own assets. And if the government has an interest in those assets, then they might be more compelled to have policies that favour development.”

Asian giant

Western nations are targeting the Asian giant which controls some 90% of critical metals mining and processing in a surge of resource nationalism that has lately erupted into a Cold War of critical metals. Washington and Beijing are squaring off over access to advanced US computer chips, and the critical minerals needed for aerospace, defence applications and mobile phones that America craves.

MP Materials (NYSE: MP), which holds the producing Mountain Pass rare earths mine in California, secured in July a $400 million agreement with the Pentagon that will see it acquire a 15% stake in MP and buy critical minerals for defence projects. The miner also reached a deal with the Department of Defense in August for a $150 million loan to add heavy rare earth separation capabilities at Mountain Pass.

Jay Martin, CEO of mining forum company Cambridge which runs the annual Vancouver Resource Investment Conference, was a bit of two minds on government stakes, but he considers nation states as corporations, and their investment as good for the industry.

“It’s a bit distasteful, because I don’t want government in my private business,” Martin told The Northern Miner podcast host Adrian Pocobelli.

“But if we could have the firepower of the US government, adding some additional capital, cutting red tape and expediting the permitting processes of our core industries being raw materials, that’s good for commodity investors.”

Indeed, the stocks of companies with US government investment have soared on the news.

Kevin Torpy, senior vice-president of mining at Graphite One (TSXV: GPH), welcomed $37.5 million in US government funding under Biden in 2023 to advance the $1.13 billion Graphite Creek project in Alaska.

“Graphite One is grateful for the funding and believes that this type of federal support for establishing domestic supply chains for graphite and other critical minerals is an important part of the nation’s security,” Torpy said in an emailed reply to questions.

The funding helped Graphite One accelerate its feasibility study for the project, deemed to hold America’s largest reserve of the battery metal.

More examples

Recent Defense Production Act and Department of Energy grants illustrate how widely Washington is investing across North America.

In Canada, funding included $20 million in August 2024 for Electra Battery Materials’ (NASDAQ, TSX: ELBM) cobalt sulfate refinery in Temiskaming Shores, Ontario, and $8.35 million in May 2024 for Lomiko Metals (TSXV: LMR) to convert flake graphite into battery-grade anode material. The Quebec government, however, remains opposed to Lomiko’s project after local complaints.

Fireweed Metals (TSXV: FWZ) received $15.8 million to advance development studies for the Mactung tungsten project — the world’s largest deposit — in the Northwest Territories and Yukon.

In the United States, Canadian companies have also benefited from Biden-era programs, including $114.8 million for Talon Metals (TSX: TLO) to build a nickel processing plant in North Dakota, plus $20.6 million and $2.4 million for expanded exploration and extraction research at its Tamarack project in Minnesota and Michigan.

Under Trump, Ucore Rare Metals (TSXV: UCU) secured $18.4 million to scale up rare-earth separation in Louisiana and $4 million from the US Army for separation demonstrations at its Kingston, Ontario. RapidSX plant.

Rare earths

The US has also broadened its footprint in critical minerals and rare earth projects through new equity, contract and grant support. Lynas Rare Earths (ASX: LYC) secured a Department of Defense contract to build a heavy rare earth separation facility in Texas, supplementing earlier Title III support for light rare earth processing there.

Perpetua Resources (NASDAQ, TSX: PPTA) won up to $6.9 million from the US Army for its Stibnite antimony-gold project in Idaho. NioCorp (NASDAQ, TSX: NB) is slated to receive Title III support via a $10 million award for its Elk Creek rare earth, niobium and titanium project in Nebraska.

Golden Metal Resources (AIM: GMET) was awarded $62 million under a Department of Defense program to support tungsten production. Syrah Resources (ASX: SYR) received a conditional commitment of up to $107 million from the US Department of Energy’s Loan Programs Office to expand lithium-ion battery materials capacity at its Vidalia, Louisiana facility.

Opposition

The Trump administration is supporting critical minerals projects even where there is local and environmental opposition, like at Rio Tinto’s (ASX: RIO) Resolution project in Arizona and Trilogy’s project in Alaska. There, the environmental advocacy group Sierra Club called the government investment a blow to subsistence communities and wildlife because of potential impact on caribou migration.

It remains to be seen if Washington will go as far to support the contentious Pebble copper-gold project in the same state. Northern Dynasty Minerals (TSX: NDM; NYSE-A: NAK) is challenging in court the US Environmental Protection Agency’s veto of the project.

“It’s good for government to get behind mining projects,” Fasken’s Tóth said. “It’s been a long time since Western governments have been pro-mining. For too long, mining has been the anti-carbon type of view. And it’s actually nice to see that governments are realising that mining plays a central role in the world, much like water and air.”

Forty new Level 2 charging ports will be installed in Springfield, Illinois courtesy of a $629,000 grant from the Illinois Community Charging Program. The city’s electric utility, City Water Light and Power, received the grant and will own the new chargers. The utility also aims to continue expanding charging infrastructure after the 40 new ports are added.

At the moment, Springfield has about 190 charging stations, according to PlugShare. Believe it or not, 16 of them are free, according to the same website. Just under 40 are fast chargers.

On the surface, it might not seem that adding 40 new public EV charging ports is that newsworthy, but it is, because installing more new chargers decreases range anxiety in places where there aren’t enough and new installations are actually happening in many places. “Around 780 public high-speed charging stations opened across the country in the third quarter of 2025. By all accounts, that’s the largest such infrastructure boom on record, according to Department of Energy data reviewed by Bloomberg.”

Springfield has a population of about 114,000, and hundreds of thousands visit to experience the Abraham Lincoln-related sites each year. Many travel to Springfield by car. “Tourism is big business in Springfield, bringing in $536 million in 2023. Tourism is tied to 3,500 hospitality jobs in the city and $20 million in local tax revenue. That’s according to Visit Springfield Director Scott Dahl.” You wouldn’t think little old Springfield would have so many annual tourists, but it does, and more and more of them drive EVs.

Springfield is the Illinois state capital and is a population center for central Illinois, so it has visitors related to all the government activities too.

The whole state of Illinois has fewer than 150,000 registered EVs. Expanding public charging infrastructure can help with greater EV adoption, especially since federal EV purchasing incentives are no longer available.

Some people seem to believe EVs need to have 800 miles of range or more to solve “range anxiety,” but this is not true. What is needed is the expansion of EV charging infrastructure to decrease the distance between existing public chargers.

One example, which is not in Illinois, is the “West Coast Electric Highway, an extensive network of electric vehicle (EV) DC fast charging stations located every 25 to 50 miles along Interstate 5 and other major roadways in the Pacific Northwest.”

When there are plenty of public EV chargers every 25 miles or so, no EVs will need a huge amount of range.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ChatGPT-Image-Oct-19-2025-08_30_23-AM-800x533.png,N,,2025-10-20 08:12:51.450064

One of those homeowners is Dan Harrison, who frequently experienced hours-long power outages in his Los Angeles home before investing in a rooftop solar system, as the New York Times explained.
Harrison produces more electricity than he uses, meaning he pays nothing for energy, compared to his prior bill of $3,600 a year.
It's easy to see why more energy experts are recommending solar, both for homeowners' peace of mind and grid stability.
""It's the one-two punch you need to solve the climate crisis,"" Omar Nasser, founder of Treepublic Solar, the company that installed Harrison's system, told the Times.","With power bills surging in many areas across the United States, more homeowners are turning to solar energy and battery storage to cut costs and gain energy independence. One of those homeowners is Dan Harrison, who frequently experienced hours-long power outages in his Los Angeles home before investing in a rooftop solar system, as the New York Times explained.

Over the past six years, he's gradually added more panels and batteries to the system, and the investment has paid off. Harrison produces more electricity than he uses, meaning he pays nothing for energy, compared to his prior bill of $3,600 a year.

As a bonus, his neighbors can enjoy the excess electricity generated by the system, allowing them to avoid disruptive and even dangerous power outages that may occur during extreme temperatures. Harrison told the Times he often has enough juice left over to send around 50% back to the grid.

By going solar, you're not just saving a ton of money on energy bills, but also benefiting the planet by producing non-polluting electricity, and potentially helping your neighbor keep the lights on. EnergySage can help you find the perfect system for your needs with its free tools that let you compare quotes from qualified installers and save up to $10,000 on a home system.

You can also use its free mapping tool to view the average cost of a rooftop solar setup, along with available tax incentives based on your state, making it easy to maximize your savings. However, if your budget doesn't allow for the upfront investment in solar, leasing might be a more suitable option.

With Palmetto's LightReach program, you can have panels installed for no money down and never have to worry about maintenance. Plus, you can avoid volatile energy prices and lock in low rates, allowing you to reap all the benefits of solar without breaking the bank.

Pairing home solar with an energy-efficient heat pump can help you save even more on electric bills, and if you want to see your options, Mitsubishi can connect you with a vetted installer who will help you find the right system for your home.

Make sure to take advantage of the 30% solar tax credit and home appliance rebates by the end of the year, as they will expire on Dec. 31.

Government publishes first ever national plan to recruit workers needed for clean energy mission, with over 400,000 extra jobs by 2030

31 priority occupations such as plumbers, electricians and welders are particularly in demand

5 new clean energy Technical Excellence Colleges to train next generation of workers, as part of government’s drive for two-thirds of young people to be in higher-level learning

Energy Secretary to set out measures ensuring companies receiving public grants and contracts need to deliver good jobs across the clean energy sector

A generation of young people across Britain will benefit from the good jobs and high wages that the booming clean energy economy can bring, under new plans announced by the government today as part of the clean energy superpower mission

Backed by record government and private sector investment in clean energy such as renewables and nuclear, the clean energy economy is sparking a boom in demand for good industrial jobs in all regions and nations of the UK – with 31 priority occupations such as plumbers, electricians, and welders particularly in demand.

For the first time, government will today (Sunday 19 October) publish a comprehensive national plan to train up the next generation of clean energy workers, with employment expected to double to 860,000 by 2030, ensuring jobs are high quality and well paid.

See the Clean Energy Jobs Plan

Setting clear workforce estimates for the first time will galvanise industry, the public sector, and education providers to work together to deliver one cohesive strategy to invest in training for specific in demand occupations.

The Energy Secretary will also set out how this government sees trade unions as an essential part of the modern workplace and economy. Across the broader energy sector, trade union coverage has declined from over 70% in the mid 90’s to around 30% today. Recognising trade unions is vital to securing high pay and good conditions for workers.

Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said: “Communities have long been calling out for a new generation of good industrial jobs. The clean energy jobs boom can answer that call – and today we publish a landmark national plan to make it happen.

“Our plans will help create an economy in which there is no need to leave your hometown just to find a decent job. Thanks to this government’s commitment to clean energy, a generation of young people in our industrial heartlands can have well-paid secure jobs, from plumbers to electricians and welders.

“This is a pro-worker, pro-jobs, pro-union, agenda that will deliver the national renewal our country needs.”

Secretary of State for Work and Pensions Pat McFadden, said: “We’re giving workers the skills needed for switch to clean energy, which is good for them, good for industry – and will drive growth across the nation.

“Our new jobs plan will unlock real opportunities and ensure everyone has access to the training and support to secure the well-paid jobs that will power our country’s future, as part of our Plan for Change.”

The government’s clean energy mission is already delivering for the UK, with the certainty and stability of the government’s mission having galvanised over £50 billion of private investment since last July.

The government has also given Sizewell C the green light, which will support 10,000 jobs at peak construction, announced Rolls Royce as the preferred bidder for the small modular reactor programme to support up to 3,000 jobs, and kickstarted the Acorn and the Viking projects in Scotland and the North East that is estimated to support a combined 35,000 jobs, including 1,000 apprenticeships. This builds on the 4,000 jobs already set to be created in CCUS projects in the North West and Teesside.

For young people, these jobs can offer higher levels of pay- with entry level roles in the majority of occupations in clean energy paying 23% more than the same occupations in other sectors.

Jobs in wind, nuclear, and electricity networks all advertise average salaries of over £50,000, compared to the UK average of £37,000, and are spread across coastal and post-industrial communities.

New initiatives include:

Training up the next generation of clean energy workers – 5 new Technical Excellence Colleges will help train young people into essential roles. Skills pilots in Cheshire, Lincolnshire and Pembrokeshire will be backed by a total of £2.5 million – which could go towards new training centres, courses or career advisers

Harnessing the valuable expertise and transferrable skills of veterans – Working with Mission Renewable, the government is launching a new programme to match veterans up with careers in solar panel installation, wind turbine factories, and nuclear power stations

Tailored schemes for ex-offenders, school leavers, and the unemployed – Last year alone, 13,700 people who were out of work possessed many of the skills required for key roles in the clean energy sector, such as engineering and skilled trades

Upskill existing workers – Oil and gas workers will benefit from up to £20 million in total from the UK and Scottish governments to provide bespoke careers training for thousands of new roles in clean energy. This follows high demand for the Aberdeen skills pilot, which is already supporting workers into new careers. Government is also extending the ‘energy skills passport’, which identifies routes for oil and gas workers to easily transition into roles in offshore wind, to new sectors including nuclear and the electricity grid

The plan also includes landmark proposals to ensure that jobs in the clean energy sector have world class pay, terms and conditions.

Closing loopholes in legislation to extend employment protections enjoyed by offshore oil and gas workers working beyond UK territorial seas, including the national minimum wage, to the clean energy sector

A new Fair Work Charter between offshore wind developers and trade unions to ensure that companies benefiting from public funding provide decent wages and strong workplace rights

Workforce criteria in grants and procurements to test and pilot innovative ways to drive fair work and skills in DESNZ grants and contracts, including through the Clean Industry Bonus and Great British Energy

It comes after the Prime Minister announced a package of reforms to elevate and transform the education skills system, with a new target for two-thirds of young people to participate in higher-level learning – academic, technical or apprenticeships – by age 25, up from 50% today.

With at least 1 in 6 ex-military already armed with many of the skills needed for the clean energy sector, the government is joining forces with Mission Renewable to match them up with careers in solar panel installation, wind turbine factories, and nuclear power stations.

The pilot will initially focus on the East of England, which will benefit from the biggest increase in the size of the clean energy workforce with over 60,000 people expected to be employed in the sector by the end of the decade.

Secretary of State for Wales Jo Stevens said: Wales’s growing clean energy industry is delivering the well-paid, highly-skilled jobs of the future.

“Projects right across the country from Pembrokeshire to Flintshire are creating opportunities for hundreds of our young people and will help drive regional growth as well as accelerating our drive towards lower bills and energy security.!

Paul Nowak, General Secretary of the TUC, said: “After years of previous governments starving British industry of investment, this represents a serious plan to start to rebuild our industrial heartlands and deliver quality jobs in clean energy – as well as supporting even more in supply chains right across the country.

“Crucially, it puts decent work at the heart of our energy system. And it shows that when government makes a plan with unions and workers, the whole country can benefit.

“Whether it’s welders in Wrexham or pipefitters on Teesside, the firm commitment to clean energy jobs being good union jobs is one which will improve working lives the country over.

“We now look forward to government delivering a similarly robust and funded plan for the North Sea transition, which safeguards jobs and livelihoods.”

Charlotte Brumpton-Childs, National Officer at the GMB, said: “GMB has long campaigned for a jobs first transition. The government is listening and having a jobs plan to underpin the industrial strategy is exactly what this country needs.

“GMB welcomes this roadmap for clean energy jobs and the cast iron expectation unions and their members will be at the heart of this.

“We need fair work agreements and taxpayers’ cash has to be spend where good jobs are going to be created. Today’s plan not only sets out that expectation but crucially, how good jobs can be measured.”

Eddie Dempsey, General Secretary of the RMT, said: “RMT welcomes the government’s commitment to closing loopholes in maritime and offshore employment law, which should in turn create domestic opportunities in coastal communities that support the entirety of the offshore wind supply chain.

“This plan has the potential to create hundreds of thousands of good jobs across the UK, offering real opportunities for those wishing to transition from oil and gas and for a new generation of workers in their own communities.”

Christina McAnea, General Secretary of UNISON said: “Clean, homegrown energy is essential in tackling climate change and delivering economic growth. This plan can help create a UK workforce with highly skilled, fairly paid and secure jobs.

“Extra investment for retraining will mean experienced staff already employed in the sector are able to take on new roles. Additional funding for apprenticeships and opportunities for young people are crucial too if the UK is to have a bright and clean energy future.”

Alasdair McDiarmid, Assistant General Secretary of Community, said: “After long years of managed decline and neglect under previous governments, we now have an ambitious government which is serious about rebuilding Britain’s industrial base. Crucially, the government is also investing in the skills needed to power the future of British manufacturing – something Community has long called for.

“The push for new clean energy jobs will also support our members in both the light industries and steel sector, with steel being an essential component for green energy infrastructure and construction.

“We look forward to opportunities to collaborate with the government as they roll out this initiative across the UK, delivering for working people in the communities they live in.”

Sue Ferns OBE, Senior Deputy General Secretary at Prospect, said: “The infrastructure investment required to achieve the government’s clean energy mission must be backed by a major boost to jobs and skills.

“If this mission is to be a success, and support the wider industrial strategy and growth agendas, then we urgently need a step-change in the level of workforce development. In this context is it welcome that this Jobs Plan now exists and the new initiatives are a welcome step in the right direction.”

Frances O’Grady, Former General Secretary of the TUC, said: “Energy workers and their families are at the heart of this plan – showing the clean energy transition provides not just energy security but job security.

“Alongside this, it’s a promise that every pound of taxpayers’ money will be used to help create the decent apprenticeships, jobs, and livelihoods that Britain needs.”

Unite general secretary Sharon Graham said: “Well paid, secure work must be at the heart of any green transition. Unite members will welcome the commitment to 400,000 green jobs with strong collective bargaining rights.

“The actions set out in this plan are initial steps in what must be an ambitious strategy for tangible jobs, backed by an equally ambitious programme of public investment.

Chris O’Shea, Chief Executive of Centrica, said: “We have committed to creating a new apprenticeship for every day of this decade. These new secure, skilled, well-paid jobs are key to unlocking the economic growth the UK so desperately needs.

“Clean energy isn’t simply about new technology – it’s about renewing purpose and harnessing the skills and infrastructure that have served us for decades to power the next chapter.

“I’m proud Centrica has the largest unionised workforce in UK energy and services, and we are delighted to welcome the government’s Clean Jobs Plan as a vital step in recognising the skills, protections and careers that must underpin the energy transition.”

Keith Anderson, CEO of ScottishPower, said: “Thanks to the clear direction set out by the government’s Clean Power 2030 Mission, we’re investing at record levels in the clean electricity infrastructure the UK needs for energy security and economic growth.

“Our £24 billion investment plan is creating thousands of job opportunities. We’re recruiting for good, well-paid skilled jobs at record levels. We’re welcoming 300 new recruits in the last 3 months of 2025 alone and aim to bring on another 2,000 jobs up to 2027.

“Many of these jobs are in the communities that we serve in Scotland, England and Wales. This is on top of the benefits for local supply chain businesses across the country from our commitment to domestic procurement that currently supports 70,000 jobs in the UK supply chain.”

EDF power solutions UK CEO Matthieu Hue said: “We welcome the plan which brings clarity on the scale of the opportunity for people across the UK to work in high quality jobs which will contribute to our electric future.

“EDF power solutions has 2 GW of wind, solar and battery in operation and our goal is to have 5 times that amount by 2035, so we will need many more skilled people to help us reach our ambition.

“Our partnership with 4 trade unions, GMB, Prospect, Unison and Unite shows our commitment to working together with them to grow our business.”

Darren Davidson, Vice President of Siemens Energy UK&I, said: “Siemens Energy is a major employer in the UK with 6,500 workers at sites across the UK. We have taken on 140 new apprentices this autumn, and we currently have more than 200 active vacancies.

“The jobs plan announcement is welcome news, building on the Clean Power 2030 Action Plan that was launched at our Hull offshore wind blade factory.”

Chris Norbury, CEO of E.ON UK, said: “Clean power is a defining opportunity to grow the economy, strengthen energy security, and create skilled jobs that support communities nationwide. We welcome the Clean Energy Jobs Plan as a vital step towards building the workforce to realise that potential.

“We’re proud to already be delivering on this ambition by supporting around 800 people annually through our Net Zero Training Academy and wider skills initiatives, and welcoming over 1,300 apprentices across 100 programmes since 2018.

“Through partnerships with trade unions, schools, and local governments, we’re ensuring green jobs are good jobs, rooted in local communities with real progression, purpose, and opportunity. We look forward to working with government and industry to scale up this mission and ensure no region is left behind.”

Michael Lewis, CEO Uniper said: “We’re really pleased to see the launch of the Clean Energy Jobs Plan and the recommendations within it.

“Uniper aims to invest approximately €8 billion into growth and transformation projects by the early 2030s, including solar and onshore wind projects, hydrogen projects, and a new combined-cycle gas turbine power station with carbon capture technology at our Connah’s Quay site – contributing to the retention and creation of jobs, and supporting the regional economy.

“We recognise the need for workers to have the right skills now, and in the future, to support the UK’s and our own ambitions.”

Zac Richardson, Group Chief Engineer at National Grid, said: “Secure, affordable and clean energy is essential to unlocking UK economic growth and productivity – ambitions which are underpinned by electricity networks and the unprecedented levels of planned investment in them.

“We welcome the government’s focus on skills and training – especially for technical roles vital to our energy future – and look forward to working together to build a diverse, homegrown workforce that can deliver the grid of tomorrow.”

Tania Kumar, Director of Net Zero at the CBI, said: “The growth of the clean energy economy is creating opportunities for people and places across the whole of the UK. The launch of the Clean Energy Jobs Plan offers a tangible way to connect communities with both the opportunities emerging across the sector and the businesses at the forefront of delivering them.

“If we want people to feel invested in the transition and ensure they are able to participate in it, we must show them how they fit into the vision. This plan begins to do just that, laying out clear pathways no matter whether you’re in work, seeking employment or returning to the job market.”

Dhara Vyas, CEO of Energy UK, said: “Today’s announcement is a critical step forward in building the workforce required to deliver our future energy system. It rightly recognises the need to tackle the skills challenge collectively by investing in both new talent and our existing workforce.

“With up to 400,000 new jobs on the horizon and a clear focus on high-quality, inclusive opportunities, the Clean Energy Job Plan spotlights a once-in-a-generation opportunity to build a cleaner, fairer energy system whose benefits will be felt by people and communities across the country.”

Jane Cooper, Deputy Chief Executive at Renewable UK, said: “The Clean Energy Jobs Plan sets out the scale of the massive opportunity which the UK has to create tens of thousands of new jobs in renewables all over the country.

“It includes practical measures which will enable government and industry to work even closer together to maximise this, such as opening new Technical Excellence Colleges, building on Britain’s current success as a global leader in clean power.

“This long-awaited plan delivers on employers’ calls for a coherent government workforce strategy for clean energy and we look forward to working with Ministers to realise its ambitions.”

Katy Heidenreich Supply Chain and People Director at Offshore Energies UK, said: “Investing in skills development is essential to support the UK’s energy sector and it is encouraging to see governments recognise the huge resource of our oil and gas workforce and how their skills can be developed to provide the expertise needed for the energy mix of the future.

“Oil and gas workers have a continuing role in powering the UK today and for years to come. A successful energy future—one that is increasingly homegrown—depends on supporting the industries and people delivering energy now, alongside growing capability across all technologies.”

Claire Mack OBE, Chief Executive of Scottish Renewables, said: “The clean power mission is not just about energy security for the country, it’s about good jobs and a workforce fit the future in your locale. The scale and importance of the energy transition requires new approaches to ensure investments in skills, apprenticeships and training serve the needs of the entire economy.

“Scotland is home to world-class energy skills expertise. Working with both governments, the clean energy industry can build on this through the breadth of projects coming forward today and in the years ahead. The Clean Energy Jobs Plan is an important signal to the public and private sectors of how we must quickly strengthen our partnership on jobs and skills.”

Ben Martin, Policy Manager at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: “The net zero economy is continuing to grow, and the Clean Energy Jobs Plan clearly sets out how the government will recruit essential workers who are critical for the UK’s energy transition. This will support both net zero and economic growth across the UK, providing certainty for people and local communities.

“The plan also recognises the critical role that oil and gas workers in the North Sea will play in driving the renewable energy sector. Aligning skills standards between these 2 sectors and identifying current and future skills needs to support our low carbon future, are essential to delivering a successful UK energy transition.”

Verity Davidge, Director of Policy and Public Affairs, at Make UK said: “Manufacturers are moving at pace to invest in decarbonisation and net zero projects and the transition to clean energy offers huge opportunities for industry. To take full advantage, companies will need to have access to increasingly higher levels of skills and a talent pipeline which will fuel the growth we need to see.

“As such, this plan is a welcome recognition by government and a positive step forward that work needs to start now to get ahead of our competitors and ensure industry is equipped with the skills to do the job. In tandem with this plan we need to accelerate skills reform including ensuring that apprenticeship courses are funded to cover the real cost of training, as outlined in the clean energy sector plan.”

Clare Jackson, CEO of Hydrogen UK, said: “We welcome the Clean Energy Jobs Plan’s recognition that hydrogen will be vital to net zero and to creating high-quality jobs. Much of the oil and gas workforce already has transferable skills, and supporting their transition into hydrogen will be key to a just and rapid shift to a clean energy economy.

“The Hydrogen and Carbon Capture Skills Accelerator is a crucial first step, and over time we must move from designing courses to delivering hands-on training and upskilling to build the workforce of the future.”

Olivia Powis, CEO of the Carbon Capture and Storage Association, said: “We welcome the Clean Jobs Plan and its recognition of the vital role CCUS and hydrogen will play in achieving the UK’s growth and decarbonisation goals while keeping industries competitive. Developing the necessary skills base is crucial to unlocking these sectors’ full potential and protecting thousands of existing industrial jobs.

“Establishing a dedicated Hydrogen and CCUS Skills Accelerator, in partnership with industry, marks an important step toward creating high-quality employment and ensuring a just transition for skilled workers from the North Sea. The CCSA looks forward to collaborating with government and partners to build the workforce powering the clean energy future.”

Tom Greatrex, Chief Executive of the Nuclear Industry Association, said: “This Jobs Plan shows the huge opportunity clean power offers the UK, and the vital role nuclear will play in delivering it.

“With 100,000 people already working in nuclear in good, skilled jobs across the country, new stations like Sizewell C and a fleet of SMRs will create thousands more — especially for young people — in clean and secure energy.”

Chris Hewett, Chief Executive, Solar Energy UK, said: “Solar energy and battery energy storage already support over 20,000 British jobs, with expectations that the sectors will employ more than twice the number in 10 years’ time.

“But to reach our goals for cheaper, cleaner power, we need to redouble our efforts to attract and train staff for these fast-growing sectors. With our Solar Careers UK programme and critical support from government under the Clean Energy Jobs Plan, we have every expectation that our aspirations will be fulfilled.”

Yselkla Farmer, CEO of BEAMA, said: “We have a long heritage of manufacturing for the electricity industry in the UK. As a supply chain at the heart of the clean energy sector we know the growth potential is substantial as we electrify our energy system.

“The biggest limiting factor for investment today is the availability of a skilled workforce and therefore we welcome the focus on job creation for our supply chain. For network equipment manufacturing alone our average member expects to double employment by 2035.

“This plan sets the foundations we need to help this statistic rise further. Our members offer good jobs, in an industry rooted in local communities right across the UK, what they need is long term certainty and a commitment to support investment which this plan targets.”

Lawrence Slade, CEO of Energy Networks Association, said: “This plan is an important step towards accelerating the real economic benefits of the clean energy transition right around the country.

“Today network operators employ around 26,000 people and facilitate 1,500 apprenticeships, in order to maintain the safe, reliable operation of over 500,000 miles of wires and cables.

“Tomorrow, the clean energy transition will underpin new employment opportunities and economic expansion, with tens of thousands of jobs across the country needed to upgrade the grid, not just temporary positions, but long-term careers, from apprenticeships to advanced engineering roles.

“By working together on the Electricity Networks Sector Growth Plan, we will build on existing work and give industry and government the clarity and confidence needed to invest in the workforce, skills and supply chain capacity that will help drive us towards a clean power system.”

Lieutenant General (Retd) Richard Nugee CB CVO CBE, Chair, Mission Renewable, said: “The Clean Energy Jobs Plan reflects the valuable contributions those who have served have made and can continue to make to the nation.

“By linking veterans and their families with career opportunities in the clean energy sector, Mission Renewable helps companies tap into and retain skilled talent, while at the same time enabling Armed Forces communities to thrive and feel valued. The sector and companies benefit, the veterans benefit and ultimately the nation benefits from skilled people delivering growth and opportunity.”

Paul Cox, Group CEO of Energy & Utility Skills, said: “For the government to achieve its 2030 target, we must put people at the heart of that ambition – only by having the right people with the right skills will we deliver the UK’s energy future.

“Energy and Utility Skills Group has worked closely with the Office for Clean Energy Jobs on its plans, scoping the workforce demands as well as convening the industry to create a UK-wide awareness and attraction campaign.

“We will continue to work with purpose and pace to support the Clean Energy Jobs Plan alongside our partners in the sector.

“Together, we can turn ambition into impact.”

David Hughes, Chief Executive of Association of Colleges, said: “This exciting plan will help people get the skills they need to secure good work locally and it is great to see the investment in colleges to back the government’s ambitions on a net zero future.

“With employers stepping up as well, colleges will be able to offer the training young people need to enter the net zero construction sector, as well as the re-training adults need to move jobs.

“Colleges are ready to be at the heart of this transition, to create real career pathways and help the country lead the global green economy.”",https://nen.press/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/clean-energy-jobs-boom-big.jpg,N,,2025-10-20 08:08:03.908016
,Indiana and Evs,2025-10-19 19:00:38+00:00,the Guardian,The Guardian view on hybrid cars: profitable for carmakers but not very green | Editorial,"Editorial, www.theguardian.com",,,,,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/oct/19/the-guardian-view-on-hybrid-cars-profitable-for-carmakers-but-not-very-green,"While electric vehicles (EVs) looked like science fiction, that prediction looked prescient.
Last week it emerged that plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) aren’t very green.
Hybrid vehicles are, however, very profitable.
Carmakers can charge top dollar for what are essentially re-engineered petrol cars with a battery bolted on.
It’s that Europe’s carmakers are keeping profits rolling in by squeezing cash from hybrids and petrol cars.","“Why the future is hybrid,” chirruped the Economist in 2004. While electric vehicles (EVs) looked like science fiction, that prediction looked prescient. Fast‑forward 20 years and battery technology has improved dramatically; EVs are affordable. Last week it emerged that plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) aren’t very green. The sales pitch had been that motorists could use “clean” battery power for city jaunts and dirty petrol for longer trips. This promised sustainable travel without the anxiety of a limited range. But real‑world tests, by the European non-profit Transport and Environment, show that PHEVs emit just 19% less carbon dioxide than petrol and diesel cars – far short of the 75% claimed in the lab.

Hybrid vehicles are, however, very profitable. Carmakers can charge top dollar for what are essentially re-engineered petrol cars with a battery bolted on. They also remain attractive to policymakers keen for industry sops. By weakening electric vehicle targets, the UK government risks a scandal in pushing hybrids that emit five times more CO2 than claimed.

Europe is a battleground between climate necessity, commercial reality and political clout. Four big European automotive companies avoided more than €5bn in fines because emissions compliance was not judged on real-world data. Switching to electric cars seems an obvious step. Yet former Renault boss Luca de Meo said earlier this year that EVs won’t be the dominant technology in Europe for two decades. It’s not just a lack of buyers or engineering nous holding back EVs. It’s that Europe’s carmakers are keeping profits rolling in by squeezing cash from hybrids and petrol cars.

Newer competitors are stealing a march. The UK has just become the largest international market for China’s BYD, the world’s bestselling electric carmaker. And that’s without benefiting from the government’s new EV subsidy scheme, which excludes Chinese-made vehicles for environmental reasons. In Europe, where Elon Musk’s far-right political views have undermined Tesla brand loyalty, its new cheaper model will have to compete with Chinese EVs that sell for less than £20,000.

Yet even BYD may face its own reckoning. Its competitive edge rests on low-cost lithium iron phosphate batteries. If Toyota delivers on its promise to manufacture solid‑state batteries for commercial use by 2027, it could leave rivals behind by delivering safer power packs, faster charging and longer range. The tech promises to make the dream of driving an electric car on a single charge from London to Milan a reality. Disrupters getting disrupted is just capitalism. Whether it serves society depends on the wiring of the system. Markets reward what’s profitable, not what’s sustainable or equitable. So if Toyota does leapfrog BYD, the question isn’t “Is that fair?” It’s “Who benefits, and at what cost?”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e2e6102981fc8669fe05af7c1fc28b2845cd887/116_0_3750_3000/master/3750.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=a3a5189f86a58525313289d983de733d",N,,2025-10-20 08:13:00.040048

Between high gas prices and greenhouse gas emissions, it’s no wonder so many Americans have turned to electric vehicles. One recent Gallup poll even found that half of consumers have already either bought (7%) or would consider buying (44%) an electric vehicle.

One of the most popular options is a Tesla, a pioneer in the EV field. But is purchasing a Tesla worth the cost, especially when compared to a gas-powered sedan like the Nissan Sentra?

The answer depends on several factors, including your driving habits, where you live and the exact vehicle you purchase. Here’s a breakdown of what it costs to drive a Tesla monthly compared to a Nissan Sentra.

Typical Tesla Charging Costs

The cost of charging a Tesla depends on the model you choose. Using data from the Energy Information Administration, EnergySage estimated the cost of a full charge to be anywhere from $10.95 to $17.99.

The Tesla Model 3 costs the least to charge, while Models X and S cost the most (at $17.99 and $17.83, respectively). The average charging cost per mile is 4.56 cents.

Take the Tesla Model X as an example.

According to Tesla, this vehicle gets an EPA-estimated range of 352 miles at full charge. The average person drives an average of 1,123 monthly (or 13,476 miles a year). Assuming you drive the average amount, you’d need to charge the Model X three times a month. This means you’d spend around $54 monthly in charging costs ($17.99 times three).

Now, take the Tesla Model 3, which has the lowest charging costs and an estimated 357 miles per charge. You’d have to charge it just as frequently, but you’d be looking at closer to $33 in monthly charging costs.

As an aside, NRG Clean Power estimates the typical EV loses up to 10% of energy per charge. It’s also recommended to keep your vehicle plugged in during long periods of nonuse, like overnight.

Superchargers also cost anywhere from 24 cents to 48 cents per kWh, depending on location and time of day, per EnergySage. You could save by installing an at-home charger, but these devices cost between $300 and $650, not including installation.

Typical Nissan Sentra Fuel Costs

According to the official website, the 2025 Nissan Sentra has the following fuel economy:

30 MPG in the city (all models)

38 MPG on the highway (SR FWD and SR Midnight Edition FWD)

40 MPG on the highway (S FWD and SV FWD)

Depending on which model you choose, you can get up to 34 or 35 MPG in combined fuel economy rating.

Now, assume you drive the typical 1,123 miles a month. Using the national average gas price of $3.188 (as of Sept. 12, 2025), here’s what filling up at the tank would cost each month:

1,123 ÷ 34 MPG = 33.02 gallons

33.02 gallons x $3.188 = $105.27 monthly fuel costs

Fuel prices are significantly higher in some states, such as along the West Coast and Alaska, so expect to spend more if you live in one of those states. Fuel costs tend to be lower in the southeastern region.

Other Cost Considerations

Assuming typical driving habits, a Tesla could cost you anywhere from $33 to $54 a month to keep charged. In comparison, a Nissan Sentra costs closer to $105. That’s $51 to $72 more per month.

But there are other costs to consider, such as maintenance, insurance and the sticker price. For example, the 2025 Nissan Sentra S FWD starts at $21,590. The Tesla 3, a similar-sized sedan, starts at around $44,130.

That said, you might save on maintenance with a Tesla since there are fewer oil changes and other moving parts to deal with.

He is right that there is no choice to be made between nature and housing and that both are essential. He is right that the repeated demonisation of wildlife by some in government is both inaccurate and against the deepest instincts of the British public. He is right that the planning and infrastructure bill has been spun into this narrative and that parts of it represent a huge risk for nature. But he is wrong that environment NGOs have been “mute” in response.

Collectively and individually, we have repeatedly called out the bill publicly in the media and elsewhere, including the damaging part 3 proposals and the shambolic last-minute government amendments. We have compiled hundreds of briefings, evidence and research papers highlighting the dangers within the bill and opportunities to improve it, and urged action. We have worked with our indefatigable supporters, who have sent over 100,000 emails, letters and postcards to their MPs and the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government.

This work led to a large package of amendments that, while by no means perfect, improved part 3 of the bill, with the Office for Environmental Protection describing them as going “a long way towards addressing the issues we raised in our advice”.

We have never stopped campaigning on the bill’s flaws and we will continue to challenge where this bill could harm nature in its final stages and in implementation.

With rumours of a second planning bill also on the horizon, we will continue to do everything in our power to galvanise our supporters and to stop the environmentally, economically and politically disastrous assault on the wild spaces we all cherish.

To date, passenger cars have led Africa’s EV market, with a 61.81 percent share in 2024.
While Ghana was the leader for EV uptake in 2024, with a 29.31 percent share of the continent’s EV revenue, Ethiopia is now the fastest-growing country for EV uptake, with an anticipated CAGR of 58.92 percent through 2030.
The government has introduced a range of financial incentives to encourage EV uptake.
While infrastructure remains a major constraint to EV uptake, it demonstrates how favourable policies, financial incentives and investment in infrastructure could spur rapid change in auto-markets worldwide.","As the first country in the world to ban the import of petrol and diesel vehicles, Ethiopia is creating the blueprint for electric vehicle (EV) uptake, supported by favourable government policies. It is one of several African countries to be introducing incentives to encourage EV uptake as a means of reducing fuel dependency and supporting green transport growth.

In January 2024, Ethiopia became the first country in the world to ban the import of petrol and diesel vehicles, in a bid to reduce its fuel dependence and pollution. The government aims to import 500,000 EVs by 2030 as it encourages greater uptake across the country. While many Ethiopians were initially reluctant to switch to EV, they are becoming a much more common sight in the capital of Addis Ababa, and public perception is slowly shifting.

In Africa, the EV market size is approximately $450 million in 2025, and it is forecast to reach $4.2 billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 56.3 percent between 2025 and 2030. China is expected to become a major exporter of EVs to Africa as it continues to grow its presence in the global EV market. Although the African EV market remains small, government incentives and the growing need for more sustainable transport options are gradually leading to increased uptake across the region.

Chinese, European, and African companies are investing in regional battery and vehicle assembly capacity to drive down costs and encourage uptake across the region. Meanwhile, several national policies, such as Ethiopia’s internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle ban, Ghana’s eight-year zero-tariff window, and South Africa’s production rebates, are encouraging more consumers to invest in EVs in certain parts of the continent.

To date, passenger cars have led Africa’s EV market, with a 61.81 percent share in 2024. However, there is a growing interest in two- and three-wheelers, with the market expected to grow at a CAGR of 59.72 percent between 2025 and 2030. While Ghana was the leader for EV uptake in 2024, with a 29.31 percent share of the continent’s EV revenue, Ethiopia is now the fastest-growing country for EV uptake, with an anticipated CAGR of 58.92 percent through 2030.

Before the introduction of the ICE vehicle import ban, EVs were extremely uncommon in Ethiopia. As uptake increases, it is becoming more common to see China’s BYD brand, the current market leader, dotted around Addis Ababa. There are also a range of well-known European EV brands making their way to the Ethiopian market. There are now around 115,000 EVs in Ethiopia, out of a total of 1.5 million cars across the country.

When the ICE import ban was initially proposed, many were sceptical as around half of all Ethiopians still do not have access to electricity, and just 20 percent of households have access for at least 23 hours a day. Only a third of households have access through the national electric grid and the country is plagued with regular power cuts.

The situation is expected to improve following the opening of the Ethiopian Grand Renaissance Dam in September, 14 years after it began being developed and following several delays. The dam has a maximum capacity of 5,150 MW, doubling the country’s current electricity output, of which around 97 percent comes from hydropower. However, enhancing access is a complex issue as Ethiopia requires billions of dollars in investment to improve its electric grid to the standard needed to provide both urban and rural areas with a stable supply of electricity.

Nevertheless, the government decided that banning ICE vehicles in favour of EVs would help reduce pollution as well as significantly reduce the country’s fuel dependency, with Ethiopia spending around $4.5 billion a year on fuel imports. For a country that relies heavily on cheap, green hydropower for fuel, its dependency on fuel imports to power transport is economically unsustainable.

The government has introduced a range of financial incentives to encourage EV uptake. Including sweeping tax exemptions. While the upfront cost remains extremely high for most Ethiopians, the cost of second-hand ICE vehicles has also soared since the import ban. The government also hopes to encourage the development of domestic EV production and assembly, although this is in the nascent stage.

To support the switch, the government must now invest in the rollout of charging stations and other critical infrastructure. Ethiopia currently has around 100 charging stations, most of them in Addis Ababa, with the government hoping to increase this figure to 2,300. This limits uptake outside of the capital, where electricity access is more limited.

The introduction of an ICE vehicle import ban has drawn attention to Ethiopia, as the first country in the world to introduce a measure that many governments are targeting for the 2030s. While infrastructure remains a major constraint to EV uptake, it demonstrates how favourable policies, financial incentives and investment in infrastructure could spur rapid change in auto-markets worldwide.

In reality, environmental crime is just like this, but even worse because it happens at scale.
It’s helpful to define what environmental crime is.
These mafia-style operations are perhaps easier to conceive of as serious wrongdoing than the image of environmental crime we might have had in our heads.
I’ve tried to illustrate how a strange double standard seems to apply to how we write and talk about environmental crime – and therefore how we think about it more generally.","Whenever you read, watch, or listen to the news, you’re likely to be exposed to stories of violence and murder. As a criminal psychologist, I’m often asked to comment on these cases to pick apart the motives of the perpetrators. People want these kinds of insights because murders feel frightening and horrifying, but also oddly compelling. There’s a level of focus and fascination, and the way these crimes are covered profoundly influences our perception of what the most urgent problems facing society are.

One day it struck me that the world would be a very different place if environmental crimes were treated in the same way as murders. So, why aren’t they? And should they be?

At the moment such crimes can, mistakenly, feel distant and abstract. If someone came into your flat and set fire to your furniture, stole your valuables, killed your pet, added poison to your water … what would you do? You’d be terrified. You’d go to the police. You might want revenge. You’d certainly want justice. It would be entirely obvious to you that a crime had been committed.

In reality, environmental crime is just like this, but even worse because it happens at scale. The problem is that it doesn’t always feel that way. But criminals releasing noxious gases into the air, cutting down protected forests, fishing illegally or polluting rivers do injure us in concrete ways. And that’s before you consider the broader impacts on biodiversity and climate change.

Part of the difficulty in appreciating this is that we tend to conflate all kinds of environmental harm in a way we just don’t when it comes to more familiar crimes. People intuitively understand the difference between hate speech and murder, even though both are acts of aggression. No one thinks of them as interchangeable. But that is how we tend to think of environmental crime: people who don’t separate their recycling or fly a lot are conceptually tossed into the same category as those who perpetrate heinous acts of degradation. We need to stop putting mundane ignorance or selfishness in the same bucket as serious green crimes, and focus on the ecological equivalent of serial killers.

It’s helpful to define what environmental crime is. Put simply, it happens when someone breaks the law – negligently, recklessly or deliberately – and causes environmental damage by doing so. Sometimes, specific green laws are broken by releasing high levels of toxic material into the air, water or soil, destroying protected plants or killing endangered animals. There are also more tangential crimes, such as committing fraud to get around fishing permits, laundering money to hide the proceeds of illegal mining, or engaging in corruption to facilitate wildlife trafficking.

It’s easy to default to the well-worn stereotype of evil corporations watching the world burn while raking in the proceeds of exploitation and extraction. And while corporate misconduct is part of the problem, it’s often organised crime syndicates doing the dirty work. These more closely resemble the dangerous world of drug traffickers than men in suits making decisions based on greed.

For example, in the context of wildlife trafficking, crime bosses with money and connections in China might hire middle-men in Mozambique who head into towns to recruit desperate local people willing to poach elephants or pangolins. Guards and customs agents are bribed to turn a blind eye to ivory and pangolin scales being smuggled across borders. Paperwork is forged and financial experts set up shell companies and launder money, pretending that the syndicate trades in “plastic pellets”. The same kind of structure applies if we’re talking about illegally mined minerals, toxic waste or timber harvested from protected areas.

These mafia-style operations are perhaps easier to conceive of as serious wrongdoing than the image of environmental crime we might have had in our heads. And while money is often the driving force, it isn’t the only motivator, just as “power” isn’t the only reason people commit murder. If we ask the perpetrators why they did it, their answers can be as revealing as the explanations given for other kinds of crimes. In general, there are six psychological drivers: ease, impunity, greed, rationalisation, conformity and desperation.

And if you’re tempted to turn around and say that environmental crimes don’t happen because of individuals, but because of “the system”, I hear you. Social structures, ideologies and politics have a profound impact on human behaviour. Using this term – the system – can feel like a profound contribution to a difficult discussion, underpinned by the desire not to over simplify. But exactly who, or what, is the system?

A serial killer also lives in a society, and we can blame society for any hardships they may have faced. But if on a true-crime show I were to simply cite “the system” as a motive for murder, people would want me to be more precise. We understand that choices are involved, and motives are personal, not just systemic. Otherwise, wouldn’t we all be criminals? The same goes for those whose unlawful activity damages the environment – they are neither just victims of the system, nor purely motivated by greed.

I’ve tried to illustrate how a strange double standard seems to apply to how we write and talk about environmental crime – and therefore how we think about it more generally. Imagine a world where it occupied as much space in our news feeds and podcasts as gangs and murders do. We’d hear about the damage done, and also about the efforts to catch and punish the perpetrators. This would have a number of benefits: it would act as a deterrent for potential criminals; it would counteract the kind of eco-anxiety we feel when we think “no one is doing anything”; and it would also help set new social norms, making it clear that crimes which damage the ecosystems that sustain us are as serious as personal crimes. Putting them in the same psychological category as murder would mean we could better appreciate what’s really at stake.

(Nasdaq: CMND), (FSE: CWY0) (“Clearmind” or the ""Company""), a clinical-stage biotech company focused on discovery and development of novel psychedelic-derived therapeutics to solve major under-treated health problems, today announced the publication of a U.S. patent application by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) for its innovative combination therapy of 5-methoxy-2-aminoindane (MEAI) and N-Acylethanolamines, such as Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA), addressing binge behavior disorders.

The patent application stems from Clearmind’s ongoing collaboration with SciSparc Ltd. (Nasdaq: SPRC). This therapy targets multiple binge behaviors, including excessive alcohol consumption binge eating, smoking, compulsive shopping, and problematic sexual conduct. The combination leverages MEAI’s neuroplastic properties to reduce impulsivity and reward-seeking behavior, which, together with PEA, has shown a synergistic pharmacological effect and therefore potentially offering a breakthrough in treating substance use disorders and addictions by presenting a more effective and safer treatment than those available today.

This publication builds on Clearmind’s intellectual property portfolio. The Company has filed 13 patents related to its collaboration with SciSparc, focusing on MEAI and N-Acylethanolamines combinations for conditions such as alcohol use disorder, cocaine addiction, obesity and weight loss, and depression. Preclinical data supports MEAI's efficacy in mitigating addictive behaviors while preserving normal natural reward pathways.

“The publication of this U.S. patent application represents yet another advancement in our mission to pioneer safe and effective, next-generation treatments for binge behaviors,” said Dr. Adi Zuloff-Shani, CEO of Clearmind. “By combining MEAI’s unique neuroplastic profile with PEA’s synergistic benefits, we’re aiming to address a significant unmet needs in addiction medicine. We believe that this strengthens our position as a leader in psychedelic therapeutics and paves the way for additional clinical development.”

‒ Q3 2025 Unaudited Pro Forma Net Revenue of more than $125 million ‒

‒ Q3 2025 Unaudited DefenCath Net Revenue of more than $85 million ‒

‒ Raising FY 2025 Pro Forma Net Revenue Guidance to at least $375 million ‒

‒ ~$30mm of operating synergy on a go-forward run-rate basis before year end 2025 ‒

BERKELEY HEIGHTS, N.J., Oct. 20, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CorMedix Inc. (Nasdaq: CRMD), a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing therapeutic products for life-threatening diseases and conditions, today announced selected preliminary unaudited third quarter results and provided an update on its business. These include the following key updates:

Preliminary Q3 2025 unaudited net revenue of more than $100 million, including at least $85 million for DefenCath, and preliminary pro forma Q3 2025 unaudited Company net revenue of more than $125 million ( 1 ) . DefenCath revenue growth has been driven by stronger than projected utilization by the Company’s LDO customer as well as continued utilization growth with other customers.

Based on the current sales trend for DefenCath as well as the performance of the recently acquired Melinta portfolio, CorMedix is increasing its full-year 2025 pro forma net revenue guidance from the previously announced range of $325-$350 million to at least $375 million (1) .

Company expects Q3 2025 adjusted EBITDA ( 2 ) of at least $70 million.

The Company has made significant progress on the integration of Melinta and management now forecasts cost synergy capture of at least $30 million on a go-forward run-rate basis before the end of the fourth quarter 2025, with the remaining targeted synergies of $5 – $15 million expected to be captured in CY 2026.

CorMedix recently announced the completion of enrollment in the ongoing Phase III ReSPECT study of Rezzayo in prophylaxis of fungal infection in adult patients undergoing allogeneic blood and marrow transplant. The Company expects to be able to share clinical data in 2Q 2026 and believes that the total addressable market for prophylaxis is more than $2 billion.

Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of September 30, 2025 accounted for approximately $56 million, and the Company is guiding to a projected year end cash and cash equivalent balance of approximately $100 million. The Company’s Q3 cash balance was impacted by cash payments made for the acquisition of Melinta and associated closing costs, the Company’s strategic investment in Talphera, as well as increased working capital requirements necessary to support revenue growth.

The preliminary financial information presented in this press release is based on CorMedix’s current expectations and may be adjusted as a result of, among other things, the completion of the quarterly review procedures of CorMedix’s third quarter 2025 financial statements.

Q3 2025 unaudited pro forma net revenue was prepared by combining the estimated financial results for CorMedix and Melinta for the full fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2025, as if the transaction had closed as of the first day of the fiscal quarter. Pro Forma 2025 Net Revenue guidance was prepared by combining the estimated financial results and guidance for CorMedix and Melinta for the full fiscal year ended December 31, 2025, without further adjustment, as if the transaction had closed on January 1, 2025.

Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure and excludes non-cash items such as stock-based compensation and certain non-recurring items. The Company expects to provide a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to the most comparable GAAP measure in its earnings release relating to the third quarter 2025 financial results. Such reconciliation is not included in this release because the Company is currently finalizing certain amounts that would be required to be included in the U.S. GAAP measure or the individual adjustments for such reconciliation.

About CorMedix

CorMedix Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing therapeutic products for the prevention and treatment of life-threatening conditions and diseases. CorMedix is commercializing DefenCath ® (taurolidine and heparin) for the prevention of catheter-related bloodstream infections in adult patients undergoing hemodialysis via a central venous catheter. Following its August 2025 acquisition of Melinta Therapeutics LLC, CorMedix is also commercializing a portfolio of anti-infective products, including MINOCIN ® (minocycline), REZZAYO ® (rezafungin), VABOMERE ® (meropenem and vaborbactam), ORBACTIV ™ (oritavancin), BAXDELA ® (delafloxacin), and KIMYRSA ® (oritavancin), as well as TOPROL-XL ® (metoprolol succinate).

CorMedix has ongoing clinical studies for DefenCath in Total Parenteral Nutrition and Pediatric patient populations and also intends to develop DefenCath as a catheter lock solution for use in other patient populations. REZZAYO is currently approved for the treatment of candidemia and invasive candidiasis in adults, with an ongoing Phase III study for the prophylaxis of IFD in adult patients undergoing allogeneic BMT. Topline results of the Phase III study for REZZAYO are expected in Q2 2026. For more information visit: www.cormedix.com or www.melinta.com .

NEWPORT BEACH, Calif., Oct. 20, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- PMGC Holdings Inc. (Nasdaq: ELAB) (“PMGC” or the “Company” or “we”), a diversified public holding company executing a targeted roll-up strategy in U.S.-based manufacturing, today announced that its operating subsidiary AGA Precision Systems LLC (“AGA”) has reported a sales backlog of approximately over $711,000 in current orders logged into its Material Requirements Planning system, Sage100. AGA has also confirmed that it is actively bidding on additional Request for Quotations totaling over $700,000 from new customers. PMGC believes AGA’s current backlog and pending orders reflect robust demand, underscoring AGA’s growth momentum and the strong relationships it continues to build with both existing and new customers. PMGC also believes the backlog and pending orders strengthen AGA’s position to expand its precision machining capabilities within the aerospace and defense sectors. The backlog and quotation figures referenced herein are internally prepared, unaudited, management estimates and remain subject to change.

AGA’s milestones during the current fiscal quarter included:

Capability Expansion : AGA has expanded its manufacturing capabilities with the purchase of the following high performance machinery (delivery expected in Q4 2025):

YCM RX65 5 Axis

CMZ TA30Y High Performance Turning Center

These machine’s state-of-the-art Computer Numerical Control (CNC) systems are designed for true 5-axis simultaneous machining, reducing setups, improving accuracy, increasing throughput, and enabling the production of complex geometries in a single operation.

The RX65, part of YCM’s RF/RX series, is built on a rigid RAM-type structure for maximum stability, thermal control, and repeatability. This CNC platform allows operators to turn, mill, and drill complete parts in one setup producing more complex components faster and with higher precision. Engineered for power, rigidity, and accuracy, it is ideally suited for both heavy turning and fine milling, resulting in reduced setups, shortened lead times, and improved part quality.

PMGC believes this machinery can expand AGA’s machining capabilities across aerospace-grade materials, including inconel, titanium, steel, and aluminum. We expect these advanced technologies, following delivery, to enhance AGA’s ability to meet the demanding technical requirements of its aerospace and defense customers, and improve production precision and accelerating delivery times.

Team Growth & Community Impact : AGA now employs more than 15 full-time personnel across machining, quality assurance, and operations. The company anticipates doubling its production capacity over the next year, creating additional skilled manufacturing jobs within the California, Santa Ana community and contributing to local economic growth.

Rebranding : AGA has completed a corporate rebranding, including a new logo and improved website at www.AGAPrecision.com .

Forward-looking Statements

This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, may be forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are based on our beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to us as of the date hereof. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by the following words: “will,” “expect,” “would,” “should,” “intend,” “believe,” “expect,” “likely,” “believes,” “views”, “estimates”, or other comparable terminology.

Forward-looking statements in this document include, but are not limited to, management statements regarding tokenization, future updates and integrations with Superstate, and utilization of the Opening Bell platform and the creation of common stock tokens across various blockchains and the perceived benefits thereof. Such forward-looking statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements. Such factors include those set forth in “Item 1. Business” and “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on March 6, 2025, as well as in our other reports filed with the SEC from time to time.

All forward-looking statements are expressly qualified in their entirety by such cautionary statements. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements.

CORNELIUS, N.C., Oct. 20, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Alpha Modus Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMOD) (“Alpha Modus” or the “Company”) today issued a statement from CEO William “Bill” Alessi addressing the recent surge in short interest in the Company’s shares.

CEO Statement

“Short interest doesn’t worry me; it excites me,” said Alessi. “If professional traders want to short Alpha Modus, they’re welcome to. That interest simply tells me the market is paying attention. When our imminent commercial announcements and contract rollouts hit the wires, those positions could have to cover—fast. We’ve built real technology, real partnerships, and a patent portfolio that defines how artificial intelligence is used throughout retail. We believe those betting against us are overlooking the scale of what we own and what we have planned to unfold.”

Why This Matters

The recent increase in short positions appears tied not to company fundamentals, but to the simple reality that Alpha Modus is a new public company—one just beginning to scale its commercial operations. Revenue takes time to build, yet that build is already underway. The Company has executed signings, initiated revenue generation, and expects those revenues to expand through its licensing-based business model. Alpha Modus’s licensing structure is designed for perpetual, recurring income—month to month, year to year—as new partners join its ecosystem and the Company continues both organic deployments and litigation-driven licensing outcomes.

Adding to this dynamic, Alpha Modus has a small public float , which naturally amplifies both volatility and the potential for short-covering pressure as material announcements are made.

Alpha Modus’s intellectual property extends across the full spectrum of AI in retail. The Company’s patents arguably embody the core methods by which AI is practiced throughout the retail industry —technologies employed by hundreds, if not thousands, of participants across the sector. The company’s litigation strategy is not based on a single lawsuit against one defendant infringing upon one or two patents; it is a coordinated enforcement and commercialization program spanning numerous patents across an entire industry. As Alpha Modus continues to expand its partner network, execute new licensing agreements, and announce additional revenue-bearing activities, those betting against the Company may quickly realize the scale and durability of the Company’s position.

About Alpha Modus

Alpha Modus Holdings Inc. develops, licenses, and enforces AI-driven retail technologies that improve in-store digital experiences, planogram intelligence, targeted promotions, and retail analytics. The Company’s patent portfolio covers the foundational methods that underpin AI in retail applications. By executing a scalable program of enforcement and commercial deployment, Alpha Modus is positioned to capture and monetize a significant share of the rapidly growing AI-in-retail market.

PRESS RELEASE: CMB.TECH trading update

Cylembio plus pembrolizumab achieved a clinically relevant 19.4 months median progression free survival (mPFS) compared to 11.0 months mPFS with pembrolizumab alone; study narrowly missed progression free survival (PFS) primary endpoint for statistical significance

Improvement in PFS favored the combination across virtually all subgroups, notably in patients with PD-L1-negative tumors, BRAF V600 -mutated tumors, and elevated LDH, without adding any systemic toxicity compared to pembrolizumab alone

Final data from the Phase 2 basket trial in lung and head & neck cancers also presented

NEW YORK, Oct. 20, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- IO Biotech (Nasdaq: IOBT), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel, immune-modulatory, off-the-shelf therapeutic cancer vaccines, today presented detailed results from its global Phase 3 trial (IOB-013/KN-D18) of Cylembio ® (imsapepimut and etimupepimut, adjuvanted), in combination with Merck’s (known as MSD outside the United States and Canada) anti-PD-1 therapy KEYTRUDA ® (pembrolizumab), for the first-line treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic (advanced) melanoma. The data, presented as a proffered paper at the Melanoma and other skin tumors session of the 2025 European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Congress in Berlin, expand upon topline results reported in August 2025.

Final results from the Phase 2 basket trial (IOB-022/KN-D38) evaluating Cylembio in combination with pembrolizumab in the first-line treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and recurrent/metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck (SCCHN) were also presented.

“The Phase 3 results in advanced melanoma, together with final data from our Phase 2 basket trial, continue to build on the encouraging clinical evidence seen with Cylembio in combination with anti-PD-1 therapy,” said Mai-Britt Zocca, PhD, president and chief executive officer of IO Biotech. “These data reinforce Cylembio’s potential to serve as a first-line treatment option across multiple tumor types, and we remain committed to advancing novel immune-modulatory vaccines that may help people living with cancer.”

In the randomized Phase 3 trial, 407 patients with previously untreated advanced melanoma received either Cylembio plus pembrolizumab or pembrolizumab alone. Median progression-free survival was 19.4 months for the combination and 11.0 months for pembrolizumab (hazard ratio [HR] 0.77; 95% CI, 0.58–1.00; p=0.0558), narrowly missing the primary endpoint prespecified threshold for statistical significance (p≤0.045).

Across virtually all subgroups, outcomes in progression-free survival consistently favored the combination regimen, including among patients with PD-L1–negative tumors (16.6 vs 3.0 months; HR 0.54; 95% CI, 0.35-0.85), BRAF V600 mutated tumors (HR 0.60; 95% CI, 0.40-0.90), and elevated LDH (HR 0.60; 95% CI, 0.39-0.92). In addition, a post-hoc analysis, excluding patients previously treated with anti-PD-1 therapy in neoadjuvant or adjuvant settings, showed mPFS of 24.8 months vs 11.0 months (HR 0.74; 95% CI, 0.56–0.98).

The combination was well tolerated, with no increase in immune-mediated adverse events (34.0% vs 38.4%) or grade ≥3 treatment-related events (14.5% vs 15.6%) compared to pembrolizumab alone. Local vaccine-related injection-site reactions, reported in 56% of patients in the exploratory arm, were generally mild and transient, mostly grade 1/2. IDO1- and PD-L1–specific T-cell responses were expanded in the vaccine arm versus the pembrolizumab arm, reinforcing the therapy’s proposed immune-modulatory mechanism.

“Despite the narrow miss on statistical significance, I am encouraged by the clinically meaningful improvement in progression-free survival observed with IO102-IO103 plus pembrolizumab. The consistency of findings across subgroups, together with the manageable safety profile and convenient administration, supports continued exploration of IO102-IO103 as a potential option for patients. I am particularly excited about the encouraging outcomes seen in patients with PD-L1–negative tumors across multiple endpoints,” said Jessica Hassel, MD, Professor at the Department of Dermatology and National Center for Tumor Diseases at the University Hospital Heidelberg, Germany, and lead enrolling investigator for the Phase 3 trial.

Phase 2 Basket Trial in NSCLC and SCCHN

Also presented at ESMO were final data from the Phase 2 basket trial (IOB-022/KN-D38), evaluating Cylembio in combination with pembrolizumab as first-line treatment for patients with NSCLC (PD-L1 TPS ≥50%) or SCCHN (PD-L1 CPS ≥20).

Among 49 efficacy-evaluable patients (31 with NSCLC and 18 with SCCHN), mPFS was 8.1 months at 21.4 months of follow-up in NSCLC and 7.0 months at 18 months of follow-up in SCCHN, with durable responses and encouraging 18-month overall survival (OS) rates. The combination’s safety profile remained consistent with anti–PD-1 monotherapy, with no new safety signals.

The poster can be found on the “ Posters & Publications ” page of the IO Biotech website.

The Great Reckoning by Kaiser Kuo- The Ideas Letter

This is a tough read, but a must read.

In conversations I’ve had over the last few months in Beijing with professionals spanning various industries, from biotech to automotive, from renewable energy to humanoid robotics, I’ve heard variations of the same observation: The transformation that has swept through their sectors in China over the past two decades—or even just the past five years—would be utterly unfathomable to anyone who hasn’t witnessed it firsthand. They describe returning from conferences in the United States or Europe struck by a disconnect: The tsunami of transformation coming from China just isn’t felt with an urgency remotely commensurate with the scale of the disruption in store.

If you’re talking or writing about energy and not talking about what China’s doing, then you’re simply not comprehending the scale and the magnitude of what they’ve achieved. It’s extraordinary and probably without parallel — or at least with very few parallels — in the history of the world.

In the US, we have started — just begun really — to reckon with this fact:

… the painful recognition that another system, however flawed, has delivered results on a scale that the United States has not. This is to me, as an American, a source of not inconsiderable anguish. I take no pleasure in witnessing what my country has become—a nation I love, torn apart by political tribalism so intense and so toxic that I fear it may be beyond repair, at least in the coming, and critical, decade.

But confronting this crisis requires looking squarely at what seems so unsettling about China’s success. As Chas W. Freeman, a retired senior U.S. diplomat, has observed, “Americans now exhibit an odd combination of self-doubt, complacency, and hubris”— a mix that has prevented the kind of clear-eyed assessment the moment requires.

We are in denial about how rapidly China is outpacing us in energy: building a terawatt of power every two or three years while we’re on pace to add a terawatt… in two decades.

And they’re exporting not only solar panels and wind turbines and batteries all over the world, but EVs, too — the Chinese are absolutely dominating that industry globally. We have not yet reckoned with much of this. But we need to — and fast.

Factors Influencing Recent Trends in Retail Electricity Prices in the United States | Lawrence Berkley National Labs

This presentation is one of the most important and useful presentations you’ll see this year. There are many reasons why electricity costs go up or down: it defies simple explanations.

But we can find some signal in the noise of data, summarized here. One of those: “market-based” wind and solar drive prices down. It’s astounding to me that some still dispute this. Extreme weather and the need to harden the grid drive prices up. Higher natural gas prices increase electricity prices and vice versa:

Other key takeaways: the charts you see with sharply increasing cost curves for electricity do not factor in inflation and don’t take a long enough view. Adjusted for inflation, the national average for electricity prices in 2024 was less than in 2010.

But that’s an average. Residential customers have seen higher cost increases than large commercial and industrial customers:","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!chme!,w_1200,h_600,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F21e58931-b829-4db9-8f15-028d43d94554_1576x1712.png",N,,2025-10-20 08:11:14.872449

“It’s fair to say that electricity prices track natural gas prices,” he said.
“Any upward swing in gas prices is bad news for electricity prices,” he said.
Due largely to natural gas, supply costs have become the most volatile and largest component of an electric bill.
Solar, wind and battery storage deployed at certain hours can help dampen the volatility of natural gas, they said.","Most Maine homes and small businesses can expect the cost of their electricity supply to go up in January.

Nine out of 10 Maine homes receive their electricity supply through the state-run standard offer program. They’re likely to see an estimated 15 percent or so jump in rates, according to an analysis done for The Maine Monitor by Competitive Energy Services, a Portland consulting and energy procurement firm.

The projected increase could boost average supply rates for a typical home by roughly $8 a month in 2026.

The supply rate hike would be separate from whatever happens with a recent, controversial request by Central Maine Power to increase its distribution rates to upgrade its aging network of wires, poles and substations. That proposal, now at the Public Utilities Commission, has been met with strong opposition from inflation-weary customers, triggering a record 617 public comments by early October.

“Affordability is becoming a big issue, a big political issue,” said Andrew Price, Competitive Energy Services’ president and CEO. “There’s definitely outrage out there with CMP’s proposed distribution increases. The supply hike is going to feel like there’s some piling on.”

Rising electric rates are becoming a national issue, too, with the prices consumers pay up 13 percent since 2022 and projected to rise again next year, according to the federal Energy Information Administration, a non-partisan branch of the U.S. Department of Energy. In some regions, the growth is tied to building more power plants to meet demand at new data centers.

But Maine’s expected supply cost increase has nothing to do with artificial intelligence or CMP’s case. Instead, it’s tied largely to wholesale natural gas prices that are on track to keep rising in 2026.

Prices are up in part because the United States, which has become the world’s largest gas exporter, is projected to double the volume of liquefied natural gas shipped overseas by 2030, according to federal estimates. LNG exports are part of President Donald Trump’s goal of unleashing a “Golden Era of American Energy Dominance,” growing the country’s gross domestic product and adding jobs.

But higher natural gas prices are bad for energy consumers in New England. That’s because half the region’s power is generated by plants that burn natural gas. The cost of gas in turn sets what’s called the marginal price for what other forms of generation are paid for supplying New England’s power grid 24/7.

Wholesale gas prices are being watched closely now because the Maine PUC is planning next month to review the annual bids it receives from generators offering the standard supply service in 2026. There’s no way to know the precise outcome until the days the bids are accepted, but market conditions are pointing to some increase, according to Philip Bartlett, who chairs the PUC.

“It’s fair to say that electricity prices track natural gas prices,” he said. “So if we see changes in natural gas prices, they will be reflected in electricity costs.”

Electricity suppliers study cost projections on energy futures markets, and if they see gas prices rising next year, Bartlett explained, they hedge that risk by charging more for generation contracts.

“Any upward swing in gas prices is bad news for electricity prices,” he said.

Supply rates have been volatile

Mainers have received their electricity supply from an unregulated energy market for 25 years, although some residents still think their utilities are involved because the charges are included in their monthly bills. Due largely to natural gas, supply costs have become the most volatile and largest component of an electric bill.

And they’ve been on a roller coaster in recent years, ranging from roughly 6 cents per kilowatt-hour to 16 cents. They plunged during the pandemic in 2020, soared after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine roiled global energy markets, and have eased over the past two years.

Today, according to the latest figures collected by Maine’s Department of Energy Resources, standard offer supply rates are roughly 11 cents per kWh for CMP and Versant Power’s Bangor Hydro District.

Maine’s total electric rates grew at the third fastest rate in the country between 2014 and 2024, according to an analysis conducted last April by The Monitor. An overly generous state solar reimbursement policy and the costs of repairing the delivery grid following severe storms were contributors, but natural gas prices were the leading factor, the analysis found.

New England is especially vulnerable to price swings because the region’s constrained gas pipeline system doesn’t have enough capacity on the coldest winter days, requiring injections of more-costly LNG to meet demand.

The role of LNG

But LNG now is playing a role in pushing up electricity prices elsewhere in the country. As aging coal plants have retired, natural gas has become America’s leading fuel for electricity generation, meeting 42 percent of the need. At the same time, a growing share of American gas is being shipped overseas from new export terminals.

It’s headed primarily to Europe, for cutting dependence on Russian energy. And it’s going to Asia, to meet growing energy needs and to blunt tariff pressures from the Trump administration. Recent data from the Institute for Energy Economics and Finance Analysis, which promotes sustainable energy, found that, for the first time, the volume of gas being exported was more than half the amount being used at American power plants.

Although gas production and prices are always changing, the overall trend is pushing up the price of gas burned in America. The federal Energy Information Administration’s October outlook projected that a key market price used to forecast costs would rise from $2.20 per million BTU last year to $4.10 in January.

The idea that exports are pushing up gas prices isn’t universally embraced. The American Petroleum Institute, for instance, recently highlighted a report from S&P Global that found LNG exports had no major impact on domestic residential gas prices, although that report didn’t directly address the influence on electricity rates.

Campaigning last year, Trump said he intended to slash energy and electricity prices in half within 12 to 18 months. And while gasoline prices have eased a bit this year due to lower crude oil costs, electricity generation has gone in the other direction.

“We’re not on track for any Trump policies to cut electric rates for Maine ratepayers,” said Heather Sanborn, Maine’s public advocate for utility customers.

Sanborn said her office hears daily from Mainers concerned about affordable power but that the state has limited tools to address supply costs. One strategy, endorsed by her office and AARP Maine, is to explore different methods for the PUC to procure standard offer contracts.

A bill passed this year in the Maine Legislature directs the PUC to look into soliciting bids more than once a year and for varying lengths of time, in an effort to smooth the volatility in rates.

Asked about the effort, Bartlett said his agency contracted for a procurement study that recommended minor adjustments but “nothing earthshattering” that would significantly lower supply costs for Mainers. A report to the Legislature is due in January.

One strategy that could help over time, both Sanborn and Bartlett noted, is to build more cost-effective renewable energy capacity in the region. Solar, wind and battery storage deployed at certain hours can help dampen the volatility of natural gas, they said. Solar, for instance, can reduce the time gas plants need to run when demand is high, such as on a summer afternoon when air conditioners are cranking.

But federal support for clean energy has largely evaporated, especially for solar and wind, with the Trump administration doing what it can to hamstring renewable projects in favor of fossil fuel generation.

“To the extent we’re not building grid-scale storage or offshore wind, we are allowing natural gas to be the marginal cost setter in our region,” Sanborn said.",https://themainemonitor.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/electricity-meter.jpg,N,,2025-10-19 07:03:50.281043

The government has announced plans to train and recruit more workers for the UK's clean energy sector, promising to create 400,000 extra jobs by 2030.

Plumbers, electricians and welders are among 31 priority occupations that are ""particularly in demand"", with employment in renewable, wind, solar and nuclear expected to double to 860,000 in five years, ministers have said.

Speaking on the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme, Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said thousands of jobs were needed to develop Britain's clean energy sector to ""get bills down for good"".

Welcoming the proposals, Unite the union said: ""Well-paid, secure work must be at the heart of any green transition.""

As part of the government's strategy, five ""technical excellence colleges"" will be set up to train workers with clean energy skills, with £2.5m in funding going towards pilot schemes in Cheshire, Lincolnshire, and Pembrokeshire, according to the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ).

A new programme is to be launched to match veterans with careers in solar panel installation, wind turbine factories and nuclear power stations, while oil and gas workers could benefit from up to £20m from the UK and Scottish governments for bespoke careers training in clean energy roles.

There would be also be tailored schemes for ex-offenders, school leavers and the unemployed.

He said 10,000 extra jobs would be needed to support the construction of the Sizewell C nuclear power station in Suffolk and described how the Siemen's wind turbine factory in Hull was ""booming"".

Miliband also told the BBC he stood by his pledge to reduce energy bills by £300 by 2030, after bills went up by 2% for millions across the UK under Ofgem's latest price cap, which sets the maximum price that can be charged for each unit of gas and electricity for millions of househoulds in England, Scotland and Wales.

The increase for October to the end of December means a household using a typical amount of energy will pay £1,755 a year, up £35 a year.

In a statement, Miliband said the plan would bring ""a new generation of good industrial jobs"" to communities across the UK.

""Our plans will help create an economy in which there is no need to leave your hometown just to find a decent job.

""Thanks to this government's commitment to clean energy, a generation of young people in our industrial heartlands can have well-paid, secure jobs, from plumbers to electricians and welders.""

According to DESNZ, jobs in the clean energy sector command average salaries of more than £50,000, compared to the UK average of £37,000.

Work and Pensions Secretary Pat McFadden said: ""We're giving workers the skills needed to switch to clean energy, which is good for them, good for industry, and will drive growth across the nation.

""Our new jobs plan will unlock real opportunities and ensure everyone has access to the training and support to secure the well-paid jobs that will power our country's future.""

Christina McAnea, general secretary of Unison, said the government's strategy could ""help create a UK workforce with highly skilled, fairly paid and secure jobs"".

""Additional funding for apprenticeships and opportunities for young people are crucial too if the UK is to have a bright and clean energy future,"" she added.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/3836/live/0c7a8520-accb-11f0-8be0-edba131ad73f.jpg,N,,2025-10-19 07:03:36.907099

This Substack post from Matthew Yglesias on climate policy gets, I think two things right and one thing wrong. And getting those three components of climate policy correct is, I believe, important to long term, politically sustainable success in addressing climate change.

First, as Yglesias correctly notes, climate change is not a priority for most voters. The polling data on this has been consistent over time. While a majority of Americans want to do something about climate change, it never ranks particularly high on the list of priorities for voters. That in turn means that policy tools such as carbon taxes are very difficult to enact and sustain over time. It means that efforts to use large-scale political mobilization to push elected officials to take action face major hurdles, and will be difficult to sustain over time. And it means (and this is not unique to the US at all), that policy efforts to reduce fossil fuel combustion (as opposed to accelerating clean energy innovation and deployment) will also be generally politically unpopular and hard to sustain.

Second, Yglesias is also correct that much of the progress we have made in terms of decarbonization has resulted from dramatic drops in the cost, and improvements in the quality, of clean energy technologies, allowing them to be deployed at scale, and allowing for them to displace fossil fuel combustion without affirmative policy efforts to shrink fossil fuel usage.

But the third point is one that I think Yglesias is wrong about. He makes a claim that climate policy would be improved with “much less emphasis on marginally speeding up the adoption of good climate solutions, and much more emphasis on trying to solve the remaining hard problems of climate change on a technical level.” But that ignores two key points. First, much of the progress in innovation in clean energy resulted from policy choices, such as research and development support, tax credits, regulatory programs such as renewable portfolio standards, and feed in tariffs. And in fact much of the improvement for these technologies came from not just the innovation, but also supporting the expanding deployment of these technologies. Increased deployment produces “learning by doing” that has been a major driver of many of the cost reductions for these technologies. “Marginally speeding up the adoption of good climate solutions” may well have the impact of making those good solutions even better.

Second is Yglesias’s focus on broader public opinion. He is absolutely correct that public opinion is a key constraint on climate policy. But there are many other actors and sources of influence in policymaking besides just basic public opinion. Interest groups can be very important, particularly on issues that are not high salience for voters. And climate policy can have the effect of building up interest group power. Renewable energy companies were big losers in IRA repeal, but the counterfactual where there is not a relatively powerful renewable energy industry to lobby against repeal is likely a repeal that is much harsher to clean energy. And interest group pressure is a key reason why very conservative states like Texas have not (yet) mimicked the Trump Administration to impose punitive regulations or taxes on renewable energy. So again, “marginally speeding up the adoption of good climate solutions” maybe important for climate policy because of its impacts on the political landscape.

In the end, the lessons I take from these three points is that successful climate policy will often be quiet climate policy. It will not principally be driven by broad public mobilization, and it will be cognizant of political constraints in terms of its structure and direction. But it very different from a retreat from policy to entirely focusing on bleeding-edge technological innovation – something that is a necessary, but not sufficient, component of decarbonization.",https://legal-planet.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/openGraphLogo.png,N,,2025-10-19 07:04:35.982738

This renewable capacity includes sixty-five hydroelectric power plants, five wind power plants, nine solar power plants, and three hybrid power plants.
These projects include: Garadagh Solar Power Plant: The Garadagh Solar Power Plant, a two-hundred-thirty-MW facility, is being developed in partnership with Masdar, a company based in the United Arab Emirates.
Shafag Solar Power Plant: The Shafag Solar Power Plant, located in the Jabrayil region, is another significant project developed in collaboration with BP.
Together, these projects will generate a significant amount of renewable energy, helping Azerbaijan to meet its renewable energy targets.","Azerbaijan’s renewable energy sector, specifically solar power, has witnessed a notable surge in output during the first nine months of two thousand twenty-five. Solar power generation increased by twelve percent compared to the same period in the previous year, producing four hundred eighty-four million kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electricity. This boost highlights the country’s ongoing commitment to expanding its renewable energy capabilities and diversifying its energy resources.

As part of Azerbaijan’s broader renewable energy strategy, solar power is proving to be a key contributor to the country’s evolving energy mix. This growth is not just limited to solar power, as the country continues to invest in various other renewable sources, including hydroelectric, wind, and biomass energy.

⚡ Overall Electricity Generation

Azerbaijan’s total electricity generation in the first three quarters of two thousand twenty-five reached approximately twenty billion five hundred three million kWh, marking a modest increase of zero point one percent when compared to the same period in the previous year. Of this total, over nineteen billion eight hundred seventeen million kWh was commercial electricity, which remained stable from the previous year.

While the increase in overall electricity generation was relatively small, the data reflect that Azerbaijan’s energy sector is in a period of gradual but steady growth. The country continues to rely heavily on its thermal power plants and hydroelectric facilities, while also embracing newer, cleaner technologies such as solar and wind power.

🔋 Energy Source Breakdown

Hydroelectric Power Plants (HPPs): Hydroelectric plants contributed more than two billion three hundred eighty-two million kWh of electricity, reflecting a year-on-year increase of one point five percent. Hydroelectric power continues to play a dominant role in Azerbaijan’s energy mix, with the country’s vast rivers and mountainous terrain providing ample potential for hydroelectric generation.

Thermal Power Plants (TPPs): Thermal power plants generated over sixteen billion nine hundred nineteen million kWh, showing a slight decline of zero point four percent. Although thermal power generation remains the largest contributor to the country’s total electricity generation, the small decline reflects Azerbaijan’s ongoing transition towards cleaner and more sustainable energy sources.

Wind Power Plants (WPPs): Wind power contributed thirty-one million kWh, which represents a decrease of twenty-six point four percent compared to the same period in the previous year. While wind power has the potential to become a key player in Azerbaijan’s energy sector, it still faces challenges in terms of efficiency and output.

Waste Incineration: Waste-to-energy plants produced one hundred fifty-nine million kWh, reflecting a decline of one point three percent. Although waste incineration is a smaller component of Azerbaijan’s energy mix, it plays a crucial role in reducing landfill waste while generating power.

🌱 Renewable Energy Initiatives

Azerbaijan’s renewable energy capacity continues to grow steadily. By the end of two thousand twenty-four, the country had an installed renewable energy capacity of one thousand eight hundred twenty-nine point six megawatts (MW), accounting for approximately eighteen point eight percent of the total installed capacity. This renewable capacity includes sixty-five hydroelectric power plants, five wind power plants, nine solar power plants, and three hybrid power plants.

Azerbaijan has been actively pursuing policies that support the expansion of renewable energy sources. The country has set ambitious goals for the future, aiming for a thirty percent share of renewable energy in its total electricity generation by the year two thousand thirty. This commitment aligns with global trends towards cleaner, more sustainable energy solutions, as well as Azerbaijan’s desire to reduce its dependence on fossil fuels.

Azerbaijan’s focus on renewable energy also reflects its broader efforts to diversify its economy, particularly in response to the fluctuations in global oil prices. By investing in renewable energy, Azerbaijan is positioning itself as a leader in sustainable energy within the region.

🏗️ Ongoing and Upcoming Projects

Azerbaijan is currently implementing several large-scale renewable energy projects that are expected to further boost the country’s renewable energy capacity in the coming years. These projects include:

Garadagh Solar Power Plant: The Garadagh Solar Power Plant, a two-hundred-thirty-MW facility, is being developed in partnership with Masdar, a company based in the United Arab Emirates. Once completed, the plant is expected to generate five hundred million kWh of electricity annually. This plant represents one of the largest solar energy investments in Azerbaijan and highlights the country’s commitment to expanding its solar energy capabilities.

Khizi-Absheron Wind Power Plant: Another major renewable energy project is the Khizi-Absheron Wind Power Plant, a two-hundred-forty-MW wind facility being developed in collaboration with ACWA Power, a Saudi Arabian energy company. This plant is expected to generate one billion kWh of electricity per year and will contribute significantly to Azerbaijan’s wind energy capacity.

Shafag Solar Power Plant: The Shafag Solar Power Plant, located in the Jabrayil region, is another significant project developed in collaboration with BP. The facility will have a two-hundred-forty MW capacity and is expected to generate five hundred million kWh annually. This project is part of Azerbaijan’s broader efforts to increase its solar energy generation.

Mega Renewable Energy Project: The Mega Renewable Energy Project includes several large-scale solar and wind power plants, such as the Bilasuvar Solar Power Plant (four hundred forty-five MW), the Neftchala Solar Power Plant (three hundred fifteen MW), and the Absheron-Garadagh Wind Power Plant (two hundred forty MW). Together, these projects will generate a significant amount of renewable energy, helping Azerbaijan to meet its renewable energy targets.

Gobustan Solar Power Plant: The Gobustan Solar Power Plant, a one-hundred-MW project being developed by Universal International Holdings Limited from China, is expected to generate two hundred sixty million kWh annually. This plant is part of Azerbaijan’s efforts to harness its abundant solar resources.

Ufug and Shams Solar Power Plants: These two solar power plants, each with a fifty MW capacity, are planned for the Jabrayil district and are being developed by Nobel Energy. These projects will contribute to Azerbaijan’s growing solar energy capacity, generating electricity to meet both domestic and regional demand.

Floating Solar Panels Project: A groundbreaking one hundred kW pilot project is being implemented on Boyukshor Lake, marking the first floating solar panels project in Azerbaijan. This innovative project is expected to serve as a model for future floating solar energy projects in the country.

Five ""technical excellence colleges"" will be set up to train workers with clean energy skills, the Government said.
""The clean energy jobs boom can answer that call – and today we publish a landmark national plan to make it happen.
""In this context, is it welcome that this Jobs Plan now exists and the new initiatives are a welcome step in the right direction.
Dhara Vyas, chief executive of Energy UK, said: ""Today's announcement is a critical step forward in building the workforce required to deliver our future energy system.","The British government has unveiled the first-ever national plan to train and recruit workers who can fill the skills gap in the clean energy transition.

The strategy, published on Sunday, outlines how the Government will deliver on its promise for more than 400,000 extra jobs in the clean energy sector by 2030, doubling the existing opportunities.

Under the plans, ministers have identified 31 priority occupations that are particularly in demand, such as plumbers, electricians and welders.

Five ""technical excellence colleges"" will be set up to train workers with clean energy skills, the Government said.

A new programme will also be launched to match veterans with careers in solar panel installation, wind turbine factories and nuclear power stations – as will tailored schemes for ex-offenders, school leavers and the unemployed.

Elsewhere, the plans say oil and gas workers will be able to benefit from up to £20 million ($27 million) from the UK and Scottish Governments for bespoke careers training in clean energy roles.

And the ""energy skills passport,"" which identifies routes for oil and gas workers to transition into offshore wind, will be extended to new sectors, including nuclear and the electricity grid.

Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said: ""Communities have long been calling out for a new generation of good industrial jobs.

""The clean energy jobs boom can answer that call – and today we publish a landmark national plan to make it happen.

""Our plans will help create an economy in which there is no need to leave your hometown just to find a decent job.

""Thanks to this government's commitment to clean energy, a generation of young people in our industrial heartlands can have well-paid, secure jobs, from plumbers to electricians and welders.

""This is a pro-worker, pro-jobs, pro-union agenda that will deliver the national renewal our country needs.""

In the plan, the Government will set out how trade unions will be a key part of its jobs drive by recognising their role in securing high pay and good conditions for workers.

This includes a new ""fair work charter"" between offshore wind developers and trade unions to ensure firms benefitting from public funding provide good wages and strong workplace rights.

Ministers said they will also look to close loopholes in legislation to extend employment protections enjoyed by offshore oil and gas workers working beyond UK territorial seas, including the national minimum wage, to the clean energy sector.

Work and Pensions Secretary Pat McFadden said: ""We're giving workers the skills needed to switch to clean energy, which is good for them, good for industry, and will drive growth across the nation.

""Our new jobs plan will unlock real opportunities and ensure everyone has access to the training and support to secure the well-paid jobs that will power our country's future.""

It comes as part of the Government's wider efforts to boost economic growth and decarbonise the UK's electricity grid by the end of the decade.

Ministers say their decision to greenlight the Sizewell C nuclear power station in Suffolk will support 10,000 jobs at peak construction, while it announced Rolls-Royce as the preferred bidder for the small modular reactor programme to support up to 3,000 jobs.

Elsewhere, the Acorn and Viking carbon capture and storage projects (CCUS) in development in Scotland and the North East will support a combined 35,000 jobs, the Government estimates, building on the 4,000 jobs already set to be created in other CCUS projects in the North West and Teesside.

Christina McAnea, general secretary of Unison, said: ""This plan can help create a UK workforce with highly skilled, fairly paid and secure jobs.

""Extra investment for retraining will mean experienced staff already employed in the sector are able to take on new roles.

""Additional funding for apprenticeships and opportunities for young people are crucial too if the UK is to have a bright and clean energy future.""

Sue Ferns, Prospect senior deputy general secretary, said: ""If this mission is to be a success, and support the wider industrial strategy and growth agendas, then we urgently need a step-change in the level of workforce development.

""In this context, is it welcome that this Jobs Plan now exists and the new initiatives are a welcome step in the right direction.

""However, the scale of the challenge of training new workers and supporting existing workers, including those looking to transition from other roles, requires both more resource and co-ordinated effort across government.""

Dhara Vyas, chief executive of Energy UK, said: ""Today's announcement is a critical step forward in building the workforce required to deliver our future energy system.

""It rightly recognises the need to tackle the skills challenge collectively by investing in both new talent and our existing workforce.""

Jane Cooper, deputy chief executive at Renewable UK, said: ""This long-awaited plan delivers on employers' calls for a coherent Government workforce strategy for clean energy and we look forward to working with Ministers to realise its ambitions.""",https://ia.tmgrup.com.tr/ca4f0e/806/378/0/131/2048/1090?u=https://i.tmgrup.com.tr/anews/v1/2025/10/19/uk-unveils-national-plan-to-recruit-workers-for-energy-transition-1760860313312.jpg,N,,2025-10-19 05:02:59.240847

The funding, disbursed through the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program, had been withheld by the Trump administration, but Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul joined 16 other attorneys general to sue the Federal Highway Administration. In June, a judge ordered the administration to release funding appropriated to Illinois and 13 other states, according to a press release.

Following the successful lawsuit, the state announced that $18.4 million would be awarded to build 25 charging stations for electric vehicles along interstate corridors. This is the second round of NEVI disbursements. In total, the state is set to receive $148 million through this program to build out an EV charging network along interstate corridors and smaller locations.

Renewable Energy Magazine said that the charging station project will advance Illinois' goal to have 1 million EVs registered by 2030.

Because EVs produce no tailpipe pollution, they help contribute to cleaner air for communities. Traditional vehicles spew out harmful carbon pollution that has been tied to health problems, including respiratory diseases and cognitive decline.

These same pollutants are also to blame for the overheating of our planet. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, transportation-related pollution accounts for 28% of the country's planet-heating pollution — this makes this sector the worst when it comes to its climate contributions.

NEVI was made possible with the passage of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act in 2021.

""Because of the IIJA, more than $18 million is coming to Illinois to support electric vehicle charging stations,"" U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin stated in Gov.

The signing took place during the Nigeria Renewable Energy Innovation Forum 2025 in Abuja, marking one of the country’s largest coordinated commitments to clean energy expansion.

Vice President Kashim Shettima, who officiated the event, said the agreements are central to Nigeria’s plan to achieve 277 gigawatts of installed power capacity by 2060 and position the country as a renewable energy manufacturing hub for Africa. He explained that Nigeria’s energy transition represents an investment opportunity exceeding $410 billion between now and 2060, with about $23 billion required in the near term to connect millions of households still living without reliable access to electricity.

Shettima said that the shift toward renewable energy demands more than financial investment. It requires innovation, local capacity, and long-term commitment to building sustainable value chains. He emphasised that the government’s industrial strategy aims to anchor Africa’s renewable energy supply chains within Nigeria through domestic production of solar panels, battery storage systems, and smart meters, supported by technology transfer and local skill development.

The vice president noted that the new investments are expected to create about 1,500 direct jobs across participating states and strengthen Nigeria’s clean energy manufacturing base. He highlighted the role of the Federal Ministry of Power and the Rural Electrification Agency in steering policies that promote decentralised, competitive, and inclusive electricity access, particularly in off-grid and underserved regions.

At the forum, state governments entered into agreements with local and international renewable energy firms to develop solar, hybrid, and recycling projects aimed at increasing electricity generation capacity. These include partnerships that will add hundreds of megawatts to the national grid, establish recycling plants for renewable components, and expand the country’s manufacturing base for clean energy technologies.

Shettima reaffirmed President Bola Tinubu’s commitment to consolidating Nigeria’s energy transition policies through incentives for local manufacturing, streamlined regulatory processes, and enhanced collaboration among state governments, private investors, and development partners. He added that the success of Nigeria’s energy transition would not be measured by policies or projections, but by the country’s ability to turn plans into tangible outcomes that guarantee reliability, affordability, and sustainability for all citizens.

He also called on development partners and equipment manufacturers to localise production, strengthen supply chains, and invest in human capital to ensure that the benefits of renewable energy are widely shared.

Industry analysts say the agreements come at a defining moment for Nigeria’s power sector. Despite reforms aimed at improving grid efficiency, millions still lack access to electricity, particularly in rural and peri-urban communities. Expanding renewable energy infrastructure, they argue, could help reduce dependence on diesel generation and support inclusive economic growth.

Elsewhere, the Acorn and Viking carbon capture and storage projects (CCUS) in development in Scotland and the North East will support a combined 35,000 jobs, the Government estimates.

Christina McAnea, general secretary of Unison, said: “This plan can help create a UK workforce with highly skilled, fairly paid and secure jobs.

“Extra investment for retraining will mean experienced staff already employed in the sector are able to take on new roles.

“Additional funding for apprenticeships and opportunities for young people are crucial too if the UK is to have a bright and clean energy future.”

Sue Ferns, Prospect senior deputy general secretary, said: “If this mission is to be a success, and support the wider industrial strategy and growth agendas, then we urgently need a step-change in the level of workforce development.

“In this context, is it welcome that this Jobs Plan now exists and the new initiatives are a welcome step in the right direction.

“However, the scale of the challenge of training new workers and supporting existing workers, including those looking to transition from other roles, requires both more resource and coordinated effort across government.”

The Clean Energy Jobs Plan, published on Sunday (19 October), outlines how government investment and private partnerships aim to double the UK’s clean energy workforce to 860,000 by the end of the decade.

The strategy identifies 31 priority occupations – including electricians, welders, plumbers, and engineers – as critical to meeting the UK’s growing demand for renewable energy infrastructure and carbon-cutting technology.

In Wales, clean energy employment is projected to rise from around 5,000 in 2023 to about 20,000 by 2030. Key areas for job growth include offshore wind, carbon capture, hydrogen, and power grid upgrades.

North Wales and Flintshire projects leading growth

Several major projects are expected to anchor this growth in North Wales. The HyNet carbon capture and storage (CCUS) project, spanning Flintshire, Cheshire and North Wales, is forecast to create around 2,800 direct jobs. The Mona Offshore Wind Farm, located off the North Wales coast, will provide an estimated 3,500 roles over its lifetime.

Both schemes are backed by public and private investment and are seen as central to the region’s shift towards a low-carbon economy.

Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said: “Wales is essential to the clean energy revolution that this government is delivering. Communities across Wales have long been calling out for a new generation of good industrial jobs. The clean energy jobs boom can answer that call – and today we publish a landmark national plan to make it happen.

“Our plans will help create an economy in which there is no need to leave your hometown just to find a decent job. Thanks to this government’s commitment to clean energy, a generation of young people in our industrial heartlands can have well-paid, secure jobs, from plumbers to electricians and welders.”

Training and skills investment

To prepare the workforce, five new Technical Excellence Colleges will be established across the UK to train young people in key clean energy skills. Wales will also receive a share of £2.5 million in funding for regional training programmes, careers advice, and community-based skills projects.

The plan also includes targeted schemes for groups who can help fill skills gaps. A new partnership with Mission Renewable will match military veterans with careers in solar panel installation, wind turbine assembly, and nuclear energy.

Tailored programmes for ex-offenders, school leavers, and unemployed people are also being developed. Government data shows that more than 13,000 people who were out of work last year already had the skills needed for key clean energy roles such as engineering and skilled trades.

For existing workers in oil and gas, the plan provides up to £20 million in funding from the UK and Scottish Governments to help people retrain for clean energy roles. The “Energy Skills Passport”, already used in offshore wind, will be expanded to cover nuclear and grid sectors, simplifying career transitions.

Jack Sargeant, Welsh Government Minister for Skills, said: “Our ambition is to ensure today’s young people will have the skills needed to work the jobs of tomorrow, helping us embed the industries and services of the future in our communities.

“With decades of industrial expertise, Wales is primed to capitalise on the generational opportunity that is the UK’s clean energy revolution. The plan announced today will complement our Net Zero Skills Action Plan and support our journey to a cleaner, more prosperous Wales.”

Fair pay and secure employment

The plan also introduces measures to ensure clean energy jobs deliver fair pay and good working conditions. These include closing loopholes in employment law to extend minimum-wage protections to offshore clean energy workers, and a new Fair Work Charter for offshore wind developers.

Michael Lewis, Chief Executive of Uniper, which operates the Connah’s Quay Power Station in Flintshire, said: “Uniper aims to invest approximately €8 billion into growth and transformation projects by the early 2030s, including solar, hydrogen and carbon capture projects such as our Connah’s Quay development. We recognise the need for workers to have the right skills now, and in the future, to support the UK’s and our own ambitions.”

The UK Government said clean energy jobs will offer average salaries of over £50,000 a year – around 23% higher than comparable roles in other sectors.

The Clean Energy Jobs Plan aims to create skilled, well-paid work while supporting the transition to a secure, low-carbon energy future for communities across Wales.

Detroit has announced plans for a new US$40 million multimodal transit hub inside the 30-acre Michigan Central Innovation District. The project will bring together passenger rail, intercity bus, and local transit, connecting the Detroit–Ann Arbor Innovation Corridor, Detroit Metro Airport, and Toronto.

The Michigan Department of Transport (MDOT), Michigan Central, and the City of Detroit have signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to begin early design and engineering work on the project. Partners will use a US$10 million Federal Transit Administration RAISE grant awarded to MDOT and US$30 million in state funds. Decisions about final project designs, funding, and timelines will be shared as the exploratory phase progresses.

“Downtown Detroit is open for business and on the move as one of the best places to live, work, and pioneer cutting-edge ideas,” said Michigan’s Governor, Gretchen Whitmer. “Today’s MOU lays the foundation for a new multimodal transit hub that will grow our regional economy, make downtown Detroit more vibrant, and connect residents and visitors to our communities. It builds on a historic investment in transit.”

According to the partners, the proposed hub will expand access, attract investment, and position Detroit as a leader in the region’s transit future. The project supports economic opportunities by strengthening the region’s interconnected innovation ecosystem, including a proposed extension of the Chicago-Detroit Amtrak Wolverine train to Windsor and Toronto.

“As Detroit’s innovation ecosystem grows at an unprecedented rate, our transit infrastructure must evolve alongside it, by linking entrepreneurs and companies to emerging innovation zones and the opportunities they unlock,” said Josh Sirefman, CEO of Michigan Central. “This is just another step in positioning Michigan Central as the hub that not only connects people to possibility but drives regional growth.”

MDOT currently owns and operates the Howard Street bus station, which serves Greyhound, Indian Trails, Baron’s Bus, and the Amtrak station in the New Center neighbourhood. Each of these facilities has passed its useful lifespan and does not offer the amenities and functionality expected by modern travellers. The proposed hub would provide passengers with a more vibrant and accessible location with modern amenities.

“This is a positive step to further develop Michigan Central into a true transit hub and innovation ecosystem,” said Bradley Wieferich, State Transport Director. “We look forward to working with partners Michigan Central, the City of Detroit and others to make this a reality.”

Sam Krassenstein, Chief of Infrastructure for the City of Detroit, said the project would help restore the area’s historic role as the city’s main transport gateway. “For decades, Michigan Central Station was the gateway to Detroit, and we are excited to begin the work of re-establishing train service at a new multi-modal transit facility in the shadow of the station,” he said.

The UK Government has launched a new national plan to ensure Britain has the workforce needed to power the green energy transition.

It sets a pathway to creating 40,000 new clean energy jobs in Scotland by 2030, with the total number of people employed in the sector across the UK expected to double to 860,000.

The plan identifies 31 “priority occupations”, including in skilled trades such as plumbing, welding and electrician.

The Scottish Government has announced £9m extra for its existing oil and gas transition training fund over the next three years, to be matched by the UK Government, taking the total to nearly £20m.

UK ministers also plan to promote trade union membership in workplaces and create a new ‘fair work charter’ to ensure companies benefiting from public funding provide good wages and employment rights.

UK Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said: “Communities across Scotland have long been calling out for a new generation of good industrial jobs. The clean energy jobs boom can answer that call – and today we publish a landmark national plan to make it happen and places Scotland at the very heart of the clean energy revolution this government is delivering.

“Our plans will help create an economy in which there is no need to leave your hometown just to find a decent job. Thanks to this government’s commitment to clean energy a generation of young people in Scotland can have well-paid secure jobs, from plumbers to electricians and welders.”

The plan includes initiatives to upskill existing oil and gas workers to help them move to new roles in the green economy, such as via the green skills passport, as well as targeted efforts to match veterans, ex-offenders, school leavers and the unemployed with jobs.

Scottish Energy Secretary Gillian Martin said: “Scotland’s innovation, expertise and vast renewable energy resources will not only benefit the planet – but deliver new economic opportunities and new jobs for households and communities across the country… We will continue to explore how best to support Scotland’s energy skills transition, working closely with the UK Government on options like guaranteed interview schemes, redeployment pools and skills passporting.”

Carbon capture and storage is expected to create 15,000 jobs in Scotland, while investment in transmission infrastructure if project to support 17,500 jobs.

Offshore wind, including supply chain firms, are also expected to create a significant number of new roles.

The move has been welcomed by several trade unions, with Paul Nowak, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, saying: “This represents a serious plan to start to rebuild our industrial heartlands and deliver quality jobs in clean energy – as well as supporting even more in supply chains right across the country.

The United States is hopelessly broken, with red states and blue states at each other’s throats more and more. Not since the Civil War has the country been so divided, with one half of states determined to promote an inclusive society that honors the contributions of all citizens and the other half equally determined to construct a white male dominated society that punishes anyone who lost the lottery of life at birth or prays to the wrong god.

About the only branch of government that still functions as the Founders envisioned is the court system, and even that has been badly compromised by a slew of MAGA judges who are sworn to uphold the madness of King Donald, no matter what the law says. Today we have liberty and justice for white males and prison or deportation for everyone else.

Reuters reports that nearly two dozen states are now suing the administration over its cancellation of the $7 billion Solar For All grants meant to expand access to solar energy in low-income communities. It was also intended to expand community solar initiatives, which bring solar power to people who don’t own their own homes or otherwise can’t install their own solar panels.

The program was projected to help 900,000 households access solar energy so they could reduce their use of fossil fuels and lower their utility bills. The participating households were expected to collectively save more than $350 million each year on utility costs. Of course, the savings would come from burning less methane and coal, and we can’t have that, not when the federal government is a wholly owned subsidiary of the fossil fuel industry.

The majority of those 900,000 households were located in so-called red states, so you might think the Solar For All program would be welcome across the country. Not so. It turns out that while the federal government is shoveling $90 billion to a handful of tech billionaires to help them build data centers, the idea of helping low- and moderate-income Americans is too horrifying for MAGAlomaniacs to even contemplate. So the EPA — led by presidential jock sniffer Lee Zeldin — is planning to claw back the $7 billion promised by the Solar For All initiative. We’ve got to find the money for those tech bros somewhere, after all.

On October 16, 2025, California Attorney General Rob Bonta announced two lawsuits by a group of states that were previously approved grants under the Solar for All program. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced the termination of the program in August, calling it a “boondoggle.” [But apparently propping up a dictator in Argentina with 40 billion taxpayer dollars is not. Lying is all these people know.]

California will lose around $250 million in funding approved by Congress for the Solar For All program. “The administration is trying to hold us in the past, tethered to fossil fuel companies. In doing so, [it] is making America more expensive and more polluted,” Bonta said.

Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes said cancellation of the program would impact 11,000 households in Arizona and cause their utility bills to jump by 20 percent after the state lost $156 million in Solar for All funding. “Without this program, for many Arizonans, clean energy will be out of reach,” Mayes said.

She added that cancellation of the program would hit disadvantaged communities the hardest, citing the Hopi tribe of northern Arizona which was slated to get a $25 million award to bring electricity to the community. For many tribal members, it would be the first time ever that they had electricity in their homes.

The complaints were filed 10 days after a group of solar companies and labor unions sued to restore the Solar For All program. In addition to California and Arizona, states participating in the lawsuits include Maryland, Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Kentucky, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin, and the city of Washington, D.C.

Federal Judge In Louisiana Tosses LNG Terminal Permit

In other court related news of interest to CleanTechnica readers, Jack Brook of The Hill reported on October 16, 2025 that Judge Penelope Richard of Louisiana state court has invalidated a key permit for a liquefied natural gas facility in Cameron Parish that was approved by the administration earlier this year. The ruling ordered the state to review how planet-warming emissions from the LNG facility would affect Gulf Coast communities that are vulnerable to sea level rise and extreme weather. Three of America’s eight existing LNG export terminals are located in Cameron Parish, and several more are proposed or under construction there.

“Cameron Parish is ground zero for the relentless expansion of the gas export industry,” said Anne Rolfes, founder of the Louisiana Bucket Brigade, an environmental group involved in the litigation. “We’re going to stop it and this is an important step in that process.” Clay Garside, an attorney representing the Sierra Club and other environmental groups, added, “This is the first time any court has vacated a permit for a Commonwealth LNG facility based on the government’s refusal to consider climate change impacts.”

Earlier this year, energy secretary Chris “Mad Dog” Wright reversed a Biden-era pause on exports of LNG as part of his goal to boost natural gas exports and promote US “energy dominance.” Jennifer Granholm, who served as Biden’s energy secretary, had warned a year ago that “unfettered exports” of liquefied natural gas would lead to a dangerous increase in greenhouse gas emissions.

Lyle Hanna, a Commonwealth LNG spokesperson, said “we are disappointed with the District Court’s decision, and we are exploring all available legal options.” Louisiana’s attorney general Liz Murrill sputtered and fumed while vowing to appeal the decision that vacated the Louisiana Department of Conservation and Energy’s coastal use permit for the facility. “Sadly even state court judges are not immune from climate activism,” Murrill said.

Last year, a federal appeals court in Washington, D.C. ordered the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to reassess Commonwealth LNG’s air pollution, including its greenhouse gas emissions. In June, the commission gave the project a greenlight on the grounds that its construction was in the public interest. In regulatory filings, the Louisiana Department of Conservation and Energy said that “climate change is currently beyond the scope” of the state’s regulatory review.

But Judge Richard rejected that position, ruling that state environmental regulators have a duty to consider how the LNG facility, along with other similar facilities clustered nearby, would impact extreme weather events, storm severity, and sea-level rise in a state where land area equivalent to a football field disappears every 100 minutes.

Richard also ordered state regulators to analyze the facility’s impacts on local communities, especially those living in poverty or relying on fishing for their livelihoods — “defining characteristic” of the parish, she said. The LNG terminal could destroy marshes, harm water quality, and displace residents, but “none of it was considered in terms of impacts on environmental justice communities,” the judge wrote in her decision.

Commercial fisherman Eddie LeJuine, a lifelong Cameron Parish resident, told The Hill he applauded the ruling. He said the buildout of LNG infrastructure, including dredging for shipping channels, has significantly harmed the fishing industry. “The fishermen are barely hanging on with a thread,” LeJuine said. “These plants are killing the estuary and killing our livelihoods. We’re getting extinct.” Local fishermen like LeJuine say the onslaught of saltwater and sediment will kill off large amounts of oysters, crabs, and fish.

How long do you think will be before some higher court in Louisiana — the most polluted state in the US — overturns Judge Richard’s decision? A week? A month? You can bet it won’t take long as Louisiana continues to throw its citizens under the bus to please the oil and gas industries.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/solar-wap-liheap-body-e1719446207618.jpg,N,,2025-10-19 01:03:58.972722

Oil and gas workers – who are often held up as the so-called victims of the Green Transition – will benefit from up to £20m in total from the UK and Scottish Governments to fund bespoke careers training.

But more interestingly, this plan signals a clear leftward shift from Miliband (who is often held up as a vanguard of the ‘soft-left’ in the cabinet). The plan also includes several key employment rights measures that trade unions have long been calling for. And as a result, it has been enthusiastically backed by some of net zero’s loudest critics within the trade union movement, including representatives from GMB, Unite, Prospect, Community and a raft of others. Their concerns congregate around worries that the clean power transition will not treat oil and gas, and other industrial workers fairly. By laying out a clear four year strategy for clean power jobs, the Energy Secretary hopes to assuage those concerns.

As part of the offer to the unions, the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero will close the current loophole in employment rights legislation which means that those working further than 12 miles offshore do not benefit from the full raft of workers’ rights. This will provide serious benefits for those working in offshore wind and is intended to help attract more people to the sector.

The department will also set up new fair work charters which stipulate that if a clean power company (in offshore wind, or solar power, for example) wants to take up the government’s clean energy bonus, they must be able to provide clear evidence that they have good industrial relations and have a recognised union for employees. Clean Power companies have grown under the government’s renewed charge towards green energy: this stipulation in Miliband’s Clean Power Jobs plan will encourage them to give back.

Miliband described this as a “landmark national plan” and added that he hopes the government’s new measures will mean “if we get this right, we will create an economy where there is no need to leave your hometown to find a decent job”. Sources close to the Energy Secretary told the New Statesman that this is crucial to taking the fight to Reform. (Richard Tice, Reform’s deputy leader, is often heard in the Commons describing the government’s plans as “net stupid zero”). By focusing heavily on maintaining good industrial relations – especially on clean power – the government hopes to expose Reform’s double-standards and its unsustainable plans for British workers. Under the government’s logic, Reform would allow business as usual and continued drilling, despite the fact that in 2024, less than half of the UK’s oil and gas came from the North Sea. In fact, by 2027, it is estimated that the UK will be 95 per cent reliant on imported fossil fuels.

This flagship strategy comes at a particularly testy time for Labour politically. Recent polling for next week’s Caerphilly by-election has put Labour on 12 per cent well behind Reform and Plaid Cymru (42 per cent and 38 per cent respectively). Reform’s campaigning in Wales – which commenced with Nigel Farage’s press conference in June – has included pledges to reopen the coal mines, in direct contravention of Miliband’s clean power vision.

“Reform are campaigning on de-industrialisation, and re-opening the pits,” a source close to the Energy Secretary said, “we see what they’re doing in Wales.” They described the Clean Jobs Plan as a recognition from the government that more needs to be done to bring the unions along with this mission. “Ed is doing very bold stuff: he’s basically saying, you only get public money if you recognise the unions”. Some in the clean energy world have described this move as “class conscious environmentalism”.

This is all part of a realignment of Miliband’s relationship with the unions, hints of which were very clear at the Labour Party conference at the end of September. At a Climate Jobs Alliance drinks reception in Liverpool, Miliband and GMB’s general secretary, Gary Smith, signalled their new, clear alliance. Smith, who has been a fierce critic of Net Zero, told the reception “we know that working class communities are impacted first by the climate crisis”, after which Miliband gave him an avocado as an apparent “sign of their growing bond”. Indeed, GMB has looked favourably on Miliband’s new Clean Jobs Plan.

Charlotte Brumpton-Childs, national officer at GMB told the New Statesman, “GMB welcomes this roadmap for clean energy jobs and the cast iron expectation unions, and their members will be at the heart of this.” Even Unite’s Sharon Graham – a long standing and vocal critic of Miliband’s net zero mission – is on board. She said, “Unite members will welcome the commitment to 400,000 green jobs with strong collective bargaining rights,” but cautioned, “the actions set out in this plan are initial steps in what must be an ambitious strategy for tangible jobs, backed by an equally ambitious programme of public investment.”

This is clearly a powerful move by Miliband, and it proves his resilience as a cabinet minister in a particularly turbulent Labour government. Ahead of the Spending Review earlier this year, a raft of negative briefings suggested that Clean Power 2030 could be scaled back. Instead, Miliband’s department was one of the biggest winners.

After September’s reshuffle, rumours emerged that Miliband was almost demoted to Housing Secretary (the post which Steve Reed now inhabits). Instead, he stayed firm. This plan is a clear leftward signal from the Energy Secretary at a time when this government’s direction is under clear scrutiny (Miliband has backed Powell in Labour’s Deputy Leadership race which has been viewed by some as a referendum on the government’s political alignment). Could this be a signal from the Energy Secretary that in order to win the battle with Reform, Labour must return to its roots?",https://dl6pgk4f88hky.cloudfront.net/2025/10/18/gettyimages-2185394124-800x418.jpg?1760839207,N,,2025-10-18 23:04:19.825649

Momentum Grows as Bushra Amiwala Unites Youth Leaders, Faith Groups, and Local Advocates Behind Her Campaign

SKOKIE, IL — Bushra Amiwala, candidate for Congress in Illinois’ 9th District, today announced new endorsements from Next Gen Politics (IL and National Chapters), and the Northern Illinois American Muslim Alliance (NIAMA) — reflecting her continued success in bringing together young leaders, faith communities, and civic advocates from across the district.

These new endorsements build on Amiwala’s growing record of uniting diverse constituencies — from grassroots youth movements to established community leaders — around a campaign defined by service, inclusion, and capable leadership.

“I’m honored to have the support of these organizations and their members,” said Amiwala.

“They each represent the best of our district — engaged citizens, faith leaders, and organizers who care deeply about building a fairer, more inclusive future. We’re working together to ensure that every voice in this district is heard and represented.”

Next Gen Politics, a youth-led advocacy group, endorsed Amiwala for her record as one of the nation’s first Gen Z elected officials and her ongoing commitment to mentoring young people in civic life.

“Bushra Amiwala represents the new generation of leaders—compassionate, energetic, and deeply connected to her community in Illinois’ 9th District. At Next Gen Politics Illinois, we proudly endorse her because she fights fearlessly for her constituents and isn’t afraid to challenge the status quo,” said Next Gen Politics in a statement. “As the leader of a rapid response team in Skokie, Bushra has actively participated in protests, standing up against systemic issues, even in confrontations with ICE agents. Her deep-rooted commitment to her community reflects her understanding of its struggles and aspirations. In these challenging times, we need Bushra in Congress to effectively represent our voices and interests.”

NIAMA (Northern Illinois American Muslim Alliance), one of the region’s leading Muslim community organizations, praised Amiwala’s inclusive leadership and tangible results as an elected official.

“Bushra Amiwala is the candidate who best reflects understanding of the full diversity and vibrant tapestry of the 9th Congressional District,” said Vaseem Iftekhar, Chairman and Founder of NIAMA. “Through her extensive social and political work, she has consistently demonstrated a deep understanding of our communities’ needs. We especially applaud her leadership on the Halal and Kosher School Lunch Act, for which she testified in Springfield and spearheaded implementation in her school district as a board member — making it one of the first in the state to adopt the program even before it became law. Bushra has the experience, commitment, and vision to seamlessly transition into the role of an outstanding Congresswoman.”

These announcements follow Amiwala’s previous wave of endorsements from Northside Democracy for America, the Cook County Latino Democrats, and more than a dozen local elected officials and community leaders, including former Congresswoman Marie Newman (IL-03) and former congressional candidate Miracle Jenkins (IL-09). Those endorsements, announced last week, featured school board members, park and library trustees, and municipal officials from across the district.

Amiwala’s campaign continues to highlight her ability to bring together people of different backgrounds and perspectives to address shared priorities — from affordability and education to healthcare access and immigrant rights.

“What unites this coalition is a belief that good government begins with empathy and accountability,” Amiwala said. “We’re building a campaign that reflects the full diversity of our district — and the momentum continues to grow. I am so grateful for the support and will continue working tirelessly to represent every corner of our district.”

Without doubt, it is within a business’ best interest to incorporate sustainable commuting options into their ESG strategy.","Sustainable travel options for colleagues are not only good for the environment, they make good business sense too, writes Patrizia Niehaus.

As the leaves fall and the crisp morning air brushes against our cheeks, there is no mistaking it: October is here. By this stage, the schools are back in action, colleges and universities are open, and those long-awaited summer holidays are well and truly behind us.

If you listen carefully, you can almost hear the collective groan of commuters across the country, stranded in bumper-to-bumper traffic, gritting their teeth and glancing at their watches as precious minutes slip away. Rush hour has returned and with it comes more congestion, more frustration and more emissions.

“Without doubt, it is within a business’ best interest to incorporate sustainable commuting options into their ESG strategy”

In fact, the daily commute is one of the biggest contributors to traffic congestion. With over 3 million cars on our roads, and 59% of people driving to work every day, it’s no wonder the Environmental Protection Agency found that transport emissions represent the greatest overall increase in GHG emissions of any sector – rising by 129% in the last 30 years.

The reality is everybody has a role to play in reducing Ireland’s emissions and often, it’s the small steps that can lead to meaningful change. However, when considering the commute, it could be argued that businesses have a bigger influence, or more accurately a bigger opportunity, to make a real impact. After all, what is one of the main reasons the daily commute exists? People have to get to work.

The toll of travel

This realisation has not gone unnoticed with companies across the globe now facing increased pressure to disclose their ESG data. And while reporting platforms are incredibly helpful in streamlining data and ensuring compliance, they cannot create metrics out of thin air.

Businesses have a responsibility to measure and manage their emissions, including those caused by the daily commute of their employees. These emissions fall under the notoriously difficult to track and address, scope three category.

As well as higher levels of pollution, according to our own research here at KINTO Join, commuting can also have a negative impact on people’s mental health.

In fact, 45% of Irish people find their daily commute stressful. It comes as no surprise that the top frustration among commuters in Ireland is traffic congestion. In turn, those travelling by car could find a once 20-minute journey taking over an hour and a once half-empty carpark jammed with queues.

Without question, the daily commute inflicts some form of misery on employees’ lives – whether it be environmentally, physically or mentally.

Unfortunately, for many, there is no other choice than to jump in the car to get to where they need to go. However, companies do have a choice when it comes to enabling sustainable commuting for employees.

Go on green!

So, what happens if businesses decide to shift gears and embrace sustainable commuting options? Much like the challenges of commuting, the advantages are endless.

By incentivising public transport, implementing low-cost shuttle options and/or utilising carpooling apps, businesses have the ability to help reduce emissions – in some cases, saving hundreds of kilogrammes of CO2. They also have the power to enhance the commuting experience for employees.

This not only benefits people and the environment, but also the business. In general, happier staff are more productive. In turn, there is likely to be less turnover and higher retention. In fact, almost two-thirds of commuters we surveyed acknowledged they are more likely to stay in a job with more favourable commuting options.

These are all additional benefits that don’t even consider the core advantage – playing a part in reducing transport emissions, helping Ireland to meet its mandated EU climate targets and ultimately protecting our planet against climate change for generations to come.

Without doubt, it is within a business’ best interest to incorporate sustainable commuting options into their ESG strategy. It is no longer simply an environmental choice; it’s a strategic investment in both the wellbeing of a company’s workforce and the future of the organisation.",https://www.thinkbusiness.ie/app/uploads/2025/10/sustainable-travel.jpg,N,,2025-10-18 23:04:36.880335

As of October 16, Democratic attorneys general from more than 20 states and Washington, D.C, have filed two lawsuits in response to the program closure.
""The Trump administration is trying to hold us in the past, tethered to fossil fuel companies,"" Bonta said in a call cited by Reuters.
""This decision will raise energy prices and slow the growth of the solar energy we need to fill demand, which is at an all-time high,"" said executive director Jason Walsh.
The plaintiffs are challenging that the administration violated federal law by rescinding ""congressionally obligated funds"" — funds already approved by Congress.","The Solar for All program, launched on Earth Day in 2024, was set to bring cleaner, more affordable energy to nearly a million low-income and disadvantaged households. But its promise was cut short when the $7 billion grant initiative was canceled following the passage of the Big Beautiful Bill. Now, close to two dozen states are suing the Trump administration, according to Reuters.

As of October 16, Democratic attorneys general from more than 20 states and Washington, D.C, have filed two lawsuits in response to the program closure. This comes after Lee Zeldin, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, announced the termination of Solar for All in August, shortly after the funds were briefly unfrozen.

The initiative had been funded through the Inflation Reduction Act, passed under the previous administration, and it was intended to enable the installation of solar panels in communities across the country. But the project was designed to support more than just the clean energy transition away from polluting energy sources — its aims also included more resilient power grids, increased U.S. energy independence, a boost for local economies, and lower household electricity costs.

California Attorney General Rob Bonta said his state will lose about $250 million in federal funds, according to Reuters, while Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes said her state's loss of $156 million would cause energy bills for more than 11,000 Arizona families to go up by 20 percent. Mayes also noted that marginalized communities in Northern Arizona, such as the Hopi Tribe, have lost a $25 million award to bring electricity and battery storage to hundreds of homes — some of which have never been connected to the grid.

""The Trump administration is trying to hold us in the past, tethered to fossil fuel companies,"" Bonta said in a call cited by Reuters. ""In doing so, Trump is making America more expensive and more polluted.""

According to a 2024 news release issued under the previous administration, the Solar for All grants were designed to improve equitable access to solar energy in order to advance environmental justice and save more than 900,000 American households $350 million annually. In fact, with tens of thousands of U.S. residents lacking safe and consistent access to electricity at home, the program was set to improve equitable access in general.

Job creation was envisioned as another benefit of Solar for All. Following its termination, the BlueGreen Alliance, a coalition of labor unions advocating for green jobs, released a statement saying the move is an attack on working families. ""This decision will raise energy prices and slow the growth of the solar energy we need to fill demand, which is at an all-time high,"" said executive director Jason Walsh.

The AGs' lawsuits are seeking both monetary damages and reinstatement of the program. The plaintiffs are challenging that the administration violated federal law by rescinding ""congressionally obligated funds"" — funds already approved by Congress. A group of unions, nonprofits, and homeowners has also separately sued the administration for the program termination.

While a legal battle over vast sums may ensue, some states, cities, and homeowners have already been taking matters into their own hands. Some residents have been able to leverage more local funding and make at-home panel installation happen. Others are signing up for community solar programs to save money and reduce their environmental footprints.

Communities are coming together in other ways too. For example, in Maine — which happens to be one of the states involved in the lawsuits — the Center for an Ecology-Based Economy has been hosting monthly ""energy cafés"" so locals can get together to learn about home solar and other cleaner, more affordable energy options.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/white-house-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-18 21:03:37.600168

The program was announced in 2022 as a part of then-President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act, which contained significant climate change legislation. Connecticut was granted $62.45 million from EPA in 2024, but in August, $62 million was allegedly liquidated from the state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection’s account, according to Tong’s office.

“EPA no longer has the authority to administer the program,” Zeldin said. “With clear language and intent from Congress in the One Big Beautiful Bill, EPA is taking action to end this program for good.”

H.R. 1, better known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, contained language that would rescind Solar for All funds that were not legally allocated as of July 3, 2025. Tong says, though, that Connecticut should not have felt much of an impact, as the EPA obligated all $7 billion for the program in 2024.

“Congress created the Solar for All program, and EPA awarded these funds so that Connecticut could help low-income residents save millions of dollars on their energy bills.

Another billionaire has entered the electric vehicle market. Jeff Bezos is funding a startup called Slate Auto, which plans to launch a “radically affordable” EV pickup truck — priced at around $25,000 — as early as next year, according to TechCrunch.

The company will offer just one model — a compact, two-door electric truck. But with its low price and modular design, Slate could appeal to budget-conscious drivers looking for a no-frills alternative to high-end EVs.

So how does Bezos’ truck compare to Elon Musk’s Tesla Cybertruck?

Price Comparison: Slate vs. Cybertruck

According to the Slate Auto website, its signature truck is expected to be priced around $25,000.

The Tesla Cybertruck, on the other hand, starts at $72,490 for the all-wheel drive model and $114,990 for the Cyberbeast model.

That’s a difference of nearly $50,000 to $90,000, depending on the Cybertruck model, making the Slate the far more affordable choice.

Features and Range: Minimalism vs. Luxury

While the Cybertruck is packed with futuristic high-end features, Slate takes a minimalist approach to keep costs low.

Slate EV Truck

Range: 150 miles (standard), up to 240 miles with extended battery

Customization: Can be converted into a five-seat SUV, open-air vehicle or cargo truck

Interior: No infotainment system, no Bluetooth

Add-ons: Power window, heated seats, color wraps and more are available for extra cost

Tesla Cybertruck

Range: 320 to 325 miles, depending on model

Interior: Dual touchscreens, ambient lighting, 15 premium speakers

Tech: Advanced autopilot features

Who Is the Slate Truck For?

With its ultra-low price and basic build, Slate is targeting a niche audience — those who care about function over flair and affordability over luxury.

“There’s nothing wrong with trying to crack the affordability crisis, but I don’t see this as a massive volume seller,” Erin Keating, executive analyst at Cox Automotive, told The New York Times. “Ultimately, this is an extremely small EV with almost nothing in it, in a market with a growing number of affordable choices with much longer range.”

There likely won’t be much overlap between customers who would buy a Slate and those who would buy a Cybertruck. However, for buyers who want an EV truck without the luxury price tag, the Bezos-backed Slate could be a game-changer",https://cdn.gobankingrates.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Blank-Slate-and-SUV.jpg,N,,2025-10-18 21:03:41.696610

From deadly floods that claimed dozens of lives to mounting U.S. pressure on Mexican politicians, the period between October 13 and 17 highlighted the complex issues confronting President Claudia Sheinbaum’s administration. Meanwhile, business milestones, a controversial legal reform, cultural celebrations and environmental initiatives offered a window into the country’s progress and resilience.

Didn’t have time to read every story this week? Here’s what you missed.

Natural disasters devastate Mexican communities

This week marked the first stage of recovery after catastrophic flooding ravaged five central and eastern states. By week’s end, the death toll had climbed to 72 people with 48 officially declared missing, while 127 towns remained virtually inaccessible. Veracruz bore the brunt with 32 deaths, followed by Hidalgo with 21 and Puebla with 18.

The government unveiled a tracking website showing 12,350 emergency responders deployed with 30 helicopters and 681 heavy machinery units. At Friday’s press conference, Sheinbaum praised the “heroism” of approximately 52,000 federal and state workers responding to the crisis. However, she faced criticism from angry residents during a visit to Poza Rica in Veracruz, where fetid water remained ankle-deep and concerns about typhoid and cholera spread. Veracruz Governor Rocío Nahle drew particular criticism after reports emerged that she had canceled the state’s natural disaster insurance policy.

Puerto Vallarta experienced its own crisis when a nine-hour storm flooded more than 1,000 homes, claiming one life. The city also mourned the sinking of the Marigalante pirate ship following a bilge pump failure.

Business and economic developments

Mexico achieved a significant milestone, becoming the leading exporter of electric vehicles to the United States, exporting approximately 145,000 EVs last year and surpassing Japan and South Korea. Production through September 2025 reached 214,203 units, a 39.3% increase year-over-year.

Mexico is now the leading exporter of electric vehicles to the US, surpassing Japan and South Korea

Chinese investment continued as Shanghai-based Yongmaotai announced a $63 million auto parts plant in Coahuila. Mexico’s first green hydrogen plant opened in Querétaro, a partnership between German company Gerresheimer and Mexican company Cryoinfra requiring 100 million pesos ($5.3 million) in investment. The plant will produce 500 cubic meters of green hydrogen daily, reducing CO₂ emissions by 100 tons annually.

Mexico’s Energy Ministry forecasts that 96% of private-sector energy investment will go toward renewables between 2025 and 2030.

Tourism faced challenges as Tulum’s hotel occupancy dropped sharply, falling 17.5 percentage points in September to 49.2%, a drop attributed to high prices and increasing amounts of sargassum seaweed washing ashore on local beaches.

Cartel violence costs lives and stifles growth

Violence and organized crime remained pressing concerns. Authorities confirmed the discovery of 60 bodies at a clandestine burial site near Hermosillo, Sonora, with the Sonora Peace Seekers collective uncovering the remains between January and February. Five suspects have been arrested.

A drone attack targeted a Mexican government office in Tijuana on Wednesday night, with cartels deploying three drones carrying improvised explosive devices filled with nails and metal pieces. The attack damaged cars at the state attorney general’s anti-kidnapping unit but caused no casualties. The U.S. Consulate issued a security alert following the incident.

In Mexico City, prominent lawyer David Cohen Sacal was shot dead outside a courthouse on October 14, attacked at point-blank range by an 18-year-old assailant.

Sinaloa foreign direct investment plummets amid cartel turf war

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security raised alarms about Mexican cartels supposedly offering bounties of up to $50,000 for attacks on U.S. federal agents. At Wednesday’s press conference, Sheinbaum said the U.S. hadn’t provided Mexico with any evidence related to the alleged bounty program.

Violence in Sinaloa took its economic toll as foreign direct investment plummeted 87% during the first six months of 2025, shrinking from $262.8 million to $34.3 million.

Mexico-US diplomatic tensions

Relations between the two nations showed strain when Reuters reported that more than 50 Morena-affiliated politicians have had their U.S. visas revoked, with the total potentially exceeding 70. Former U.S. ambassadors suggested the Trump administration is using this tool more aggressively on drug trafficking and corruption issues.

New laws and institutional changes

Congress approved a major reform to the Amparo Law, with supporters claiming it will release over 2 billion pesos ($108 million) in tax credits. At Thursday’s press conference, Sheinbaum dismissed Fitch Ratings’ concerns that the reform could dampen investment.

The Chamber of Deputies raised fees on tourist and residency visas, with some residency permits more than doubling in cost. A one-year temporary residency visa will rise from 5,328 pesos ($290) to 11,140 pesos ($606), while permanent residency will climb from 6,494 pesos ($353) to 13,578 pesos ($738). The legislation also doubles admission fees to priority museums and archaeological sites and raises taxes on soft drinks, electrolyte beverages, tobacco and casino gambling.

In a cybersecurity revelation, U.S. researchers found that much Mexican satellite data is unencrypted. Computer scientists intercepted unencrypted communications from Mexican government agencies, the military, and companies using $600 worth of equipment. At Friday’s press conference, Defense Minister Ricardo Trevilla insisted all military communications are encrypted and denied evidence of data interception.

The Bank of Mexico also began withdrawing the blue 20-peso bill featuring President Benito Juárez after nearly 20 years in circulation.

Nuevo León Governor Samuel García inaugurated the first phase of the $1.2 billion Interserrana Highway, which will reduce travel times from southern Nuevo León to Monterrey from five hours to three.

Cultural highlights

Even as the country struggled with natural disasters and security problems, Mexico’s cultural scene flourished both at home and abroad. Stars gathered at the 23rd Morelia International Film Festival, featuring Brazilian filmmaker Kleber Mendonça Filho, French actress Juliette Binoche, and Oscar-winning writer Charlie Kaufman.

Former Mexico City street sweeper Macario Martínez performed on NPR’s “Tiny Desk Concert,” eight months after his viral sensation “Sueña Lindo, Corazón” captivated social media.

Mexican cyclist Isaac del Toro claimed victory at the Giro del Veneto, his 16th title of 2025. The 21-year-old now ranks third in UCI world rankings.

Finally, archaeologists announced the discovery of a rare 1,400-year-old scorpion-shaped mound in Puebla’s Tehuacán Valley, described as “unprecedented” in Mesoamerica and possibly used as an astronomical observatory.

Wild Mexico

Mexico’s unparalleled natural biodiversity was on display as three iconic species made headlines this week. Gulf of California whales are suing for their right to a livable habitat, a potentially groundbreaking lawsuit allowing non-human plaintiffs (the charges were filed on behalf of the whales by the NGO Nuestro Futuro). Monarch butterflies began their annual migration to Mexico, expected to reach Michoacán and México state by early November.

And in Oaxaca, a jaguar cub named Yazu was born at the Yagul Jaguar Sanctuary, the first birth produced via the Jaguar Genetic Bank project, offering hope for the threatened species.

Looking ahead

Mexico faces a critical juncture as it navigates intersecting crises: The flooding disasters exposed infrastructure vulnerabilities requiring sustained investment. Sheinbaum’s government must balance disaster response with security challenges and increasingly complex U.S. relations. Meanwhile, critics say recent legal reforms could undermine average citizens’ access to justice. Yet amid these difficulties, Mexico’s surging EV exports, renewable energy leadership, cultural achievements and environmental conservation efforts demonstrate resilience and adaptability that may prove crucial for navigating the uncertain times ahead.

Russell Greenslade, Director of CBI Wales, said: “The growth of Wales’ clean energy economy is opening up real opportunities for people and communities right across the nation.","A “clean energy jobs boom” could create “a new generation of good industrial jobs” in Wales, the UK Government says.

It has published a national plan to train the next generation of clean energy workers, with employment expected to double to 860,000 by 2030.

It says Wales will benefit from up to 20,000 clean energy jobs by 2030. Key skills needed in the region include trades such as electricians, bricklayers and plumbers as well as engineers and metal workers, with the largest clean energy employer expected to be in carbon capture as well as offshore wind, the UK Government said.

Energy Secretary Ed Miliband has also set out the role the UK Government wants to see trade unions play in clean energy. Across the broader energy sector, trade union coverage has declined from more than 70% in the mid 1990s to around 30% today.

Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said:

“Wales is essential to the clean energy revolution that this government is delivering. Communities across Wales have long been calling out for a new generation of good industrial jobs. The clean energy jobs boom can answer that call – and today we publish a landmark national plan to make it happen.

“Our plans will help create an economy in which there is no need to leave your hometown just to find a decent job. Thanks to this government’s commitment to clean energy a generation of young people in our industrial heartlands can have well-paid secure jobs, from plumbers to electricians and welders.

“This is a pro-worker, pro-jobs, pro-union, agenda that will deliver the national renewal our country needs.”

In January it was announced that Pembrokeshire had been identified as a ‘key growth region for clean energy’ and was set to receive around £1 million in skills funding.

The skills regional funding comes from the UK Government’s Office for Clean Energy Skills Fund and will be awarded for skills mapping to the Welsh Government. It will be responsible for developing a plan for how best to target the money.

The UK Government said funding could go towards new training centres, courses or career advisers, supporting people into opportunities in industries such as welding, electrical engineering, and construction.

Welsh Government Minister for Skills, Jack Sargeant, said:

“Our ambition is to ensure today’s young people will have the skills needed to work the jobs of tomorrow, helping us embed the industries and services of the future in our communities.

“With decades of industrial expertise Wales is primed to capitalise on the generational opportunity that is the UK’s clean energy revolution. The plan announced today will complement our Net Zero Skills Action Plan and support our journey to a cleaner, more prosperous Wales.”

The UK Government said new skills initiatives include:

Training up the next generation of clean energy workers – Five new Technical Excellence Colleges will help train young people into essential roles. Skills pilots in Pembrokeshire, Cheshire and Lincolnshire will be backed by a total of £2.5 million – which could go towards new training centres, courses or career advisers.

Harnessing the valuable expertise and transferrable skills of veterans – Working with Mission Renewable, the UK Government is launching a new programme to match veterans up with careers in solar panel installation, wind turbine factories, and nuclear power stations.

Tailored schemes for ex-offenders, school leavers, and the unemployed – Last year, 13,700 people who were out of work possessed many of the skills required for key roles in the clean energy sector, such as engineering and skilled trades.

Upskill existing workers – Oil and gas workers will benefit from up to £20 million in total from the UK and Scottish Governments to provide bespoke careers training for thousands of new roles in clean energy. This follows high demand for the Aberdeen skills pilot, which is already supporting workers into new careers. Government is also extending the ‘energy skills passport’, which identifies routes for oil and gas workers to easily transition into roles in offshore wind, to new sectors including nuclear and the electricity grid.

Russell Greenslade, Director of CBI Wales, said:

“The growth of Wales’ clean energy economy is opening up real opportunities for people and communities right across the nation. The launch of the Clean Energy Jobs Plan provides a practical, forward-looking framework to connect local talent with both the opportunities emerging in this fast-developing sector and with the businesses driving delivery on the ground.

“Wales is already showing how workers, particularly those from traditional industries, can successfully transition into clean energy roles, drawing on our established strengths and deep industrial heritage. If we want people to feel genuinely invested in this transition and empowered to play their part, we must clearly show them where they fit in and how their skills and experience can contribute to Wales’ cleaner, stronger economic future.”

Zac Richardson, Group Chief Engineer at National Grid, said:

“Secure, affordable and clean energy is essential to unlocking UK economic growth and productivity – ambitions which are underpinned by electricity networks and the unprecedented levels of planned investment in them.

“We welcome the UK Government’s focus on skills and training – especially for technical roles vital to our energy future – and look forward to working together to build a diverse, homegrown workforce that can deliver the grid of tomorrow.”

The plan also includes proposals such as:

Closing loopholes in legislation to extend employment protections enjoyed by offshore oil and gas workers working beyond UK territorial seas, including the national minimum wage, to the clean energy sector.

A new Fair Work Charter between offshore wind developers and trade unions to ensure that companies benefiting from public funding provide decent wages and strong workplace rights.

Workforce criteria in grants and procurements to test and pilot innovative ways to drive fair work and skills in DESNZ grants and contracts, including through the Clean Industry Bonus and the newly formed Great British Energy.

With at least one in six ex-military already armed with many of the skills needed for the clean energy sector, the UK Government is joining forces with Mission Renewable to match them up with careers in solar panel installation, wind turbine factories, and nuclear power stations. The pilot will initially focus on the East of England, which will benefit from the biggest increase in the size of the clean energy workforce with over 55,000 people expected to be employed in the sector by the end of the decade.",https://businessnewswales.com/wp-content/uploads/Solar-Panels-Local-Energy.jpg,N,,2025-10-18 20:04:15.044436

Up to £18m of new money has been pledged by the UK and Scottish governments specifically to move those working in the oil and gas sector into new roles.

Their jobs are about to fall off a cliff as the industry declines, with at least 40,000 of the current 115,000 jobs forecast to disappear by the early 2030s.

Almost all of those roles are thought to be fairly easily transferable into green industries - requiring little more than a few months of extra training.

But in the absence of government help, workers have been moving abroad, industry says, taking with them the expertise Britain badly needs to for its new greener energy system.

And it has left them feeling forgotten about after years of working to keep the lights on, and increasingly swayed by Reform UK, both GMB and Unite unions have warned Labour.

Pledge to double green jobs by 2030

Energy Secretary Ed Miliband told Sky News that creating jobs in sectors like carbon capture and storage and hydrogen would help ""create a future for those in the North Sea communities"".

The new £18m will pay for careers advice, training, and ""skills passports"" to enable oil and gas workers to make the switch without having to repeat qualifications.

The cash was announced on Sunday in the new Clean Energy Jobs Plan, which details how the government hopes to make good on its promise to double green jobs by 2030.

Mr Miliband said in an interview: ""This plan shows 400,000 extra jobs in the clean energy economy by 2030.

""This isn't a target. This is actually what we believe is necessary to meet all the plans we have across the economy.""

The first strategy of its kind hopes to plug the UK's massive skills gap that threatens to derail the government's target to green the electricity system by 2030.

It identifies 31 priority occupations that are particularly in demand, such as plumbers, electricians and welders, and lists a target to convert five colleges into new ""Technical Excellence Colleges"" to train workers.

'You can't train people for jobs that aren't there'

Unions welcomed the plan, but pointed out that skills and training do not equate to new jobs.

They say it will mean nothing without extra money and a revitalised domestic supply chain to build all the green technology needed, from fibreglass wind turbines to aluminium sub-sea cables.

Sharon Graham, the Unite general secretary who has threatened to cut ties with Labour over its policy to end North Sea oil and gas drilling and watering down of a ban on zero-hours contracts, welcomed the ""initial steps"" but called for ""an equally ambitious programme of public investment"".

Professor Paul de Leeuw from the Energy Transition Institute in Aberdeen said the plan was ""genuinely new and different"", and had for the first time joined up relevant information and strategies in one place.

But ""you can't train people for jobs that aren't there"", he added, also calling for an investment plan.f

Reform heartlands could benefit from Labour's jobs plan

The boom in clean energy jobs stands to benefit Reform heartlands along the east coast of Britain.

That fact is more by luck than design, given the east coast's proximity to offshore wind farms and carbon capture and storage fields in the North Sea.

Reform promises a radically different vision for the country's future, based on reopening coal mines and maxing out nuclear power and what's left of North Sea oil and gas to boost jobs and the economy.

Its deputy leader, Richard Tice, objects to land being used for solar panels and pylons.

Government modelling forecasts an additional 35,000 direct jobs in Scotland, 55,000 in the East of England and 50,000 in the North West.

To keep the unions sweet, the government will also have to follow through on its pledge to boost the rights of those working offshore in green energy.

Energy Secretary Ed Miliband is to set out measures ensuring companies receiving public grants and contracts deliver good jobs across the clean energy sector.

""For young people, these jobs can offer higher levels of pay - with entry level roles in the majority of occupations in clean energy paying 23% more than the same occupations in other sectors,"" the government said as it announced the package.

""Jobs in wind, nuclear, and electricity networks all advertise average salaries of over £50,000, compared to the UK average of £37,000, and are spread across coastal and post-industrial communities.""

A generation of young people across Wales will benefit from the good jobs and high wages that the booming clean energy economy can bring, the government added.

As part of the plans, Pembrokeshire will become home to one of five new Technical Excellence Colleges across the UK, which will help train young people into essential roles.

Skills pilots will be backed by a total of £2.5 million – which could go towards new training centres, courses or career advisers.

The government said its national plan will ensure jobs are ""high quality and well paid"".

""Setting clear workforce estimates for the first time will galvanise industry, the public sector, and education providers to work together to deliver one cohesive strategy to invest in training for specific in demand occupations.""

As well as taking a swipe at Nigel Farage's Reform party the government also signalled support for trade unions for workers' pay and conditions.

It said: ""In clear contrast, Nigel Farage’s “war on clean energy jobs” would threaten all of these jobs.

""Farage’s Party’s ideological opposition to clean energy would rob communities of good jobs in the industries of the future and lose billions of pounds of investment from areas like Wales.

""The Energy Secretary will also set out how this government sees trade unions as an essential part of the modern workplace and economy. Across the broader energy sector, trade union coverage has declined from over 70% in the mid 90s to around 30% today. Recognising trade unions is vital to securing high pay and good conditions for workers.""

Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said: “Communities have long been calling out for a new generation of good industrial jobs. The clean energy jobs boom can answer that call - and today we publish a landmark national plan to make it happen.

“Our plans will help create an economy in which there is no need to leave your hometown just to find a decent job. Thanks to this government’s commitment to clean energy, a generation of young people in our industrial heartlands can have well-paid secure jobs, from plumbers to electricians and welders.

“This is a pro-worker, pro-jobs, pro-union agenda that will deliver the national renewal our country needs.”

Secretary of State for Work and Pensions Pat McFadden echoed this saying: “We're giving workers the skills needed for switch to clean energy, which is good for them, good for industry - and will drive growth across the nation.""

First Minister Eluned Morgan said the plan was an opportunity for skilled, secure jobs. She also used the announcement to take a swipe at rivals as the Senedd election looms. Welsh Secretary Jo Stevens said the jobs would be a ""gamechanger"" for Wales and its green ambitions.

“Wales has a proud industrial heritage. Our coal powered the world and our communities still bear that legacy. Now we look to the future and to the industries of the future, ""Eluned Morgan said.

“Nigel Farage wants to take Wales backwards. He and his team want to tear up net zero plans. And Plaid Cymru say they want to see net-zero but try to block infrastructure that could deliver that.

On Thursday, a group of more than a dozen state attorneys general decided to sue the Trump administration over the termination of $7 billion in funding that was allocated to the Solar for All program.

The letter from the group of senators argues that the program would have reduced electricity bills by 20% for 900,000 households nationwide.

It says the termination is “unlawful” and the funding was “appropriated and fully obligated.”

Arizona delegation sent previous letter to EPA administrator Zeldin

A separate letter was signed by an Arizona delegation including Gallego, Kelly, Rep. Greg Stanton, Rep. Asmin Ansari and Governor Katie Hobbs on Aug. 14.

“Arizona is a prime spot for energy investments that will create good-paying jobs and lower the cost of utility bills,” said Sen. Kelly said in a release from the previous letter. “With so many of these project coming to the state, cutting funding to solar grants will hurt Arizona families.”

Stats regarding Solar for All program

The Solar for All program was introduced in 2022 as part of former President Joe Biden’s landmark climate law, intended to make the renewable energy accessible to nearly 1 million Americans.

The $7 billion program was terminated on Aug. 7, Zeldin announced.

However, the termination of some of the grant funding began in March 2025.

A release from the EPA in 2024 said the program had already chosen 60 selectees to receive grant awards and provide solar to low-income households.

“Arizona families are already struggling with rising energy costs, and the Trump administration just made things worse by canceling $156 million in funding meant to help lower energy bills and create good-paying jobs across Arizona,” said Sen. Gallego.

Automakers and governments are grappling with economic realities, including sluggish consumer demand, high production costs, and supply-chain disruptions, leading to revised targets and delayed mandates.

In the U.S., the retreat has been stark. General Motors recently announced a $1.6 billion charge related to declining EV sales, attributing the downturn to policy shifts and market conditions. This comes amid broader industry adjustments, where even pioneers like Tesla have scaled back expansion plans amid softening demand.

Policy Shifts in North America and Europe Signal a Broader Reassessment of EV Goals

Canada, under Prime Minister Mark Carney, has paused its electric-vehicle sales mandate originally slated for next year, citing the need for a more pragmatic timeline to avoid economic strain on consumers and manufacturers. Similarly, in the United Kingdom, Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s administration has introduced flexibility into the nation’s EV targets, allowing for phased implementation rather than rigid deadlines.

The European Union, long a leader in aggressive climate policies, bowed to pressure from automakers last month by initiating an early review of its 2035 goal to eliminate carbon-dioxide emissions from new cars. This move, as reported in The Wall Street Journal, reflects growing concerns over job losses in the automotive sector and the feasibility of rapid electrification without sufficient infrastructure.

Economic Pressures and Market Realities Are Forcing Even Ambitious Nations to Recalibrate

Even China, the world’s largest EV market, is showing signs of strain. While still dominating global production, Beijing has begun to temper subsidies and incentives, leading to a slowdown in sales growth. According to insights from LiveMint, economic concerns such as overcapacity and international trade tensions are prompting this caution, with exports facing tariffs in key markets like the U.S. and EU.

This synchronized retreat underscores a pivotal moment for the auto industry. High battery costs, inadequate charging networks, and consumer hesitancy—fueled by range anxiety and higher upfront prices—have exposed the limitations of top-down mandates. In the U.S., the Biden administration’s ambitious EV tax credits have not fully offset these barriers, resulting in inventory pileups at dealerships.

Industry Insiders Weigh the Long-Term Implications for Innovation and Supply Chains

For industry executives, this global realignment offers both challenges and opportunities. Companies like Ford and Volkswagen are pivoting toward hybrid models as a bridge technology, investing in flexible manufacturing lines that can adapt to shifting demand. Analysts note that while pure EV adoption slows, advancements in battery technology and renewable energy integration could accelerate once economic conditions improve.

Yet, the retreat raises questions about meeting Paris Agreement climate goals. As Political Wire highlights, without sustained policy support, the transition risks stalling, potentially ceding technological leadership to regions that maintain momentum. In the EU, for instance, automakers are lobbying for extended deadlines to preserve competitiveness against Chinese rivals.

Andy Beshear has joined elected Democrats from other states in suing the Trump administration to stop what they call the “unlawful termination” of billions of dollars for residential solar projects.

A press release Wednesday from California Attorney General Rob Bonta stated the cancellation of the $7 billion “Solar for All” program denied states “critical funds they were depending on for solar energy in low-income and disadvantaged communities nationwide.”

Bonta is among more than a dozen Democratic attorneys general, along with Beshear and Democratic Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, who are plaintiffs in the lawsuits alleging the program’s termination is illegal and unconstitutional.

When the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency terminated the program in August, Administrator Lee Zeldin in a statement on social media said the agency’s authority to administer the program was eliminated through the passage of a tax-and-spending law signed by Trump this summer. The Associated Press reported Zeldin characterized the program as a “boondoggle.”

An email received Thursday from the EPA’s press office stated the agency doesn’t comment on pending litigation.

Congress created the “Solar for All” program through the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, and the program aimed to expand residential solar energy projects to hundreds of thousands of low-income households across the country.

Kentucky officials planned to use a portion of $62 million from the program to install residential solar panels paired with battery storage systems on homes in “disaster-impacted communities.” A group of stakeholders had met several times this year in planning how the state would use the funding in communities affected by floods and tornadoes.

Robin Hartman, a spokesperson for the Kentucky Energy and Environment Cabinet, in an early September email to the Lantern said the state couldn’t access its “Solar for All” funding because it was being “unlawfully withheld by the federal administration.”

“Team Kentucky is working hard to ensure the federal government makes good on its promise to our people and delivers the entirety of this funding,” Hartman wrote in her email.",https://i0.wp.com/linknky.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_1809-1536x1024-1.jpg?fit=1536%2C1024&ssl=1,N,,2025-10-18 23:04:56.538287

It would be built on 50 acres within a 425-acre parcel directly adjacent to Tenaska’s 1-gigawatt gas plant in Fluvanna that began operations in 2004.
But a Fluvanna County ordinance passed last year sets requirements on solar development that have effectively banned it.
“Tenaska submitted a variety of projects and technologies into that [PJM] process, including battery projects, which were accepted,” said Ross, Tenaska’s spokesperson.
Fairchild said the existing gas plant can be heard from his nearby Cunningham Creek Winery.","SCOTTSVILLE, Va.—In rural Fluvanna County about an hour west of the state capital, a proposed natural gas power plant offers a window into a multi-state effort to speed more electricity sources onto the grid.

All but a handful of the projects in the initiative by PJM Interconnection, which runs the regional grid, would belch carbon pollution. Tenaska Energy’s proposal is among those dubbed by PJM as “shovel-ready, high-reliability” generation projects that would get a faster path through the clogged queue to connect to a grid increasingly stressed by power-hungry data centers.

But power plants need local approval, too. Tenaska’s proposal, which has some support, also faces concerns from residents about health effects, noise and transparency.

Last week the Fluvanna County Planning Commission deferred until November any decision on whether the 1.5-gigawatt plant is in “substantial accord” with the county’s comprehensive plan, a crucial step needed along with a special-use permit that will be voted on in January.

“I think we’d like to rely on science and independent judgment before we’re asked to take what is a very critical step for this community and its long-term future,” said commission member Kathleen Kilpatrick.

The company wants to build the project next to a gas plant it already operates in the county, the Tenaska Virginia Generating Station. Amber Kidd, a Fluvanna resident, told Inside Climate News that she supports the Nebraska-based developer’s proposal, given that her family has worked at the existing plant without any safety issues.

“We are a fossil-fuel family,” said Kidd. “I’m very proud of where we work and want to see this come. Rural areas that continue to refuse growth, they die off. … I support the jobs.”

In a county of about 30,000 people that President Donald Trump won by about six points, his staunch support for fossil fuels is far from universally shared by its residents. Lauren Banning, at the planning commission meeting last week, said she is concerned about toxic emissions more than a “negligible tax break, a few jobs, not even 50.”

“My kids love playing outside all day long, but if I’m scared of the air not being breathable, how is this helping our county and our community?” Banning said.

The Proposal

The proposed $2.2 billion plant, called the Expedition Generating Station, is expected to come online in 2031 after obtaining local, state and federal permits. It would be built on 50 acres within a 425-acre parcel directly adjacent to Tenaska’s 1-gigawatt gas plant in Fluvanna that began operations in 2004.

Timberly Ross, a spokesperson for the company, told Inside Climate News that the planning commission vote deferral “pushes us back a few months, but we remain committed to bringing this much-needed development to Fluvanna County.”

Tenaska said the new plant could power up to 1.5 million homes. It’s part of PJM’s Reliability Resource Initiative, called RRI for short. PJM, which oversees a competitive market for wholesale electricity in all or part of 13 states and the District of Columbia, is inserting RRI projects into its backlogged queue of interconnection requests.

Most of the non-RRI projects waiting to connect to the grid are renewables.

PJM created the initiative to ensure ample electric generating capacity and avoid shortages resulting from data centers’ surging demands. But clean energy supporters have decried that projects that are mostly fueled by natural gas will leapfrog renewables that have long waited their turn to start cranking out electricity.

Virginia’s largest utility, Dominion Energy, is planning for several gas plants alongside a number of renewable energy projects of its own to meet demand. Tenaska is an independent power producer that would sell electricity from Expedition either directly into the regional grid or to Dominion through a power purchase agreement.

Since the Virginia Clean Economy Act’s goal to decarbonize the electric grid by 2050 applies to only Dominion and utility Appalachian Power, Tenaska is not bound by requirements to prove the need for the plant or retire it within the next 25 years.

“This location is attractive due to access to existing transmission corridors, water supply and natural gas pipelines,” the company said in a presentation before the planning commission.

Tenaska also builds renewables projects. But a Fluvanna County ordinance passed last year sets requirements on solar development that have effectively banned it.

“Tenaska submitted a variety of projects and technologies into that [PJM] process, including battery projects, which were accepted,” said Ross, Tenaska’s spokesperson. But in Fluvanna, given local hostility to renewables, Ross said the gas plant “is the appropriate technology for this location.”

Questions About Air Pollution, Noise

Tenaska hasn’t yet disclosed expected pollution levels from the new plant. Nor has it shared in planning meetings what its current plant’s emissions have been.

Instead, at the planning commission meeting, Tenaska representatives noted what the company had anticipated its existing plant’s emissions of nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide and two types of fine particle pollution would be, estimated years before the project was built. They said it showed rates “less than 15 percent of the applicable standard.”

All of those pollutants can cause serious health problems, particularly involving the lungs.

Josephus Allmond, a resident of Fluvanna and an attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center, shared information on cancer rates at a meeting in October held by Chris Fairchild, the Board of Supervisors’ chairman. Allmond cited a 2012 report by the regional health district showing that lung cancer incidents in Fluvanna County between 2004 to 2008, the period just after Tenaska built its first plant, increased more than 30 percent compared with 1999 to 2003.

“My question for the folks at Tenaska: That was for a plant slightly under 1,000 megawatts—can we expect an even bigger increase in incidents of lung cancer if this plant is approved?” said Allmond.

Residents asked the company at that meeting why it wasn’t sharing actual pollution figures from its operating plants around the country. Tenaska officials said they would share more emissions data later, through the state’s pollution permitting process.

The company on its website also states that “claims regarding the plant and local cancer cases are ridiculous and defamatory.” Federal air standards protect against health impacts, including cancer, the company contends, and it says the new plant will be categorized as a “minor source of hazardous air pollutants” under the Clean Air Act.

Another worry raised by residents at that meeting was noise. Fairchild said the existing gas plant can be heard from his nearby Cunningham Creek Winery.

“I have the same concerns,” Fairchild told the residents. “But we don’t deal with a $2 billion item every day. There are a lot of concerns that haven’t been addressed.”

The company’s spokesperson told Inside Climate News that the current plant is a net positive for the area.

“Tenaska has operated in Fluvanna County for more than 20 years, consistently meeting stringent air quality standards, operating under the county-mandated sound levels and providing roughly $35 million in tax revenue to the county,” Ross said. “Our application … not only provided those facts but also included robust supplemental materials, including an independent sound study, economic impact study, traffic plan and visual renderings.”

Laurie Partner, a local real estate agent whose husband works at the plant, said to the planning commission that the smoke coming from the stacks was “steam,” and cancer can come from other sources like smoking and microwaving plastics.

“It was almost sickening to me to hear all the misinformation that was stated there,” Partner said in an interview with Inside Climate News.

Sharon Harris, a Fluvanna resident, said she sees a lot of misinformation floating around the county about a main alternative to new gas plants: solar. As a founding member of the Fluvanna Horizons Alliance, which opposes Tenaska’s project, she wants to raise awareness of who needs the power—data centers, not local residents—and a better understanding of how solar works.

Local resentment toward clean energy has grown through hours-long county meetings discussing potential harms to farmland from solar, stormwater runoff concerns and a presentation from the Citizen Defenders of Fluvanna County on what to do with solar panels after they’ve reached the end of their life. Some residents still see it as an expensive form of energy, even though financial advisory firm Lazard’s widely cited research on electricity costs shows solar is now the cheapest option.

“There’s definitely a lack of knowledge and information in our community,” said Harris.",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/20251007_205441.jpg,N,,2025-10-18 17:07:27.815593

Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) spokesperson Trudi Webster told Texas Scorecard that the Public Utility Commission of Texas has started rule-making “with the purpose of implementing the SB6 performance requirements for data centers’ and other large loads’ response during emergencies.”

Signed into law in 2023, Senate Bill 6, Webster explained, “creates performance requirements for new large loads during emergency conditions.”

Large loads are high electricity demand consumers, such as the newly operational Stargate data center campus in Abilene and bitcoin mining operations like the one in Rockdale, Texas.

While Texas’ regulators are imposing stricter performance standards, concerns remain over how the state can sustain these energy-hungry projects.

Stargate I campus in Abilene will have a 1.2 gigawatt (GW) power capacity, which equates to roughly 1,200 megawatts (MW), when fully completed in 2026. If the facility ran at maximum capacity when fully completed, the campus would consume 10,512,000 MWh (megawatt hours) per year. That’s enough energy to power over 1 million homes in 2025.

Data centers in Texas are forecasted by ERCOT to have a total demand of 77,965 MW in 2030. This is an increased projection from 2024, which projected a load of only 29,614 MW.

The World Economic Forum reported it is “impossible to accommodate the growth in AI data centres and maintain grid stability without prices increasing for all customers” in deregulated electricity markets like Texas.

Enverus, a publisher of energy-sector research, released a report revealing that ERCOT has “added 22.5 GW of new capacity since January 2024 … and is planning for nearly 100 GW of solar and battery additions by 2030.”

This is roughly 22,500 MW of capacity added since the beginning of last year, with planned additions of roughly 100,000 MW by 2030.

The Texas Energy Fund—overseen by the Public Utility Commission of Texas—provides grants and loans to finance the construction, maintenance, modernization, and operation of electric facilities in Texas.

According to the Enverus report, the Texas Energy Fund’s active due diligence process has seen four project withdrawals in March, two denials in April, four new projects advanced in April and May, and its first two loans awarded this summer.

While the electricity infrastructure projects appear to be slowing down and energy demands continue to increase, another issue exists in addition to rising utility bills.

Electricity consumption and water usage go hand-in-hand.

As previously reported, the Texas Water Development Board has explained that one of the reasons why Texas does not know how much water is actually being consumed by data centers in the state is because of “the variety of power sources that require varying amounts of water.” Additionally, there is “no state government authority that maintains a comprehensive list of data centers in the state.”

The indirect water consumption by data centers in 2023 has been estimated by researchers to be 4.52 liters per kilowatt hour (kWh) compared with the average American water intensity factor for electricity usage of 4.35 liters per kWh.

Amid uncertain water consumption further exacerbating infrastructure, drought, and aquifer concerns and high electricity demands, data center construction continues to proliferate throughout Texas.",https://dallasexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Pylon-high-voltage-tower-sky-background-Image-by-wing-wingShutterstock.jpg,N,,2025-10-18 17:11:38.627539

The Italian-American automaker, which owns Jeep, Dodge, Ram and Chrysler brands, will create more than 5,000 jobs while increasing domestic production capacity by 50 percent across facilities in Illinois, Ohio, Michigan and Indiana.

CEO Antonio Filosa framed the massive commitment as foundational to the company’s turnaround strategy under his leadership. Since taking the helm in June, Filosa has prioritized strengthening Stellantis’ position in the United States, its most critical market. The investment represents a signal of confidence in American manufacturing despite significant tariff pressures facing the industry.

The plan encompasses five entirely new vehicles and 19 product refreshes planned through 2029. Rather than focusing heavily on electric vehicles, Stellantis is balancing its product portfolio to include combustion engines, plug-in hybrids, and range-extended electric models alongside traditional powertrains. This marks a strategic shift from previous aggressive electrification timelines.

Illinois will see the reopening of Stellantis’ Belvidere Assembly Plant with more than $600 million in investment. The facility, shuttered in recent years, will produce Jeep Cherokee and Compass models starting in 2027, creating approximately 3,300 jobs. Ohio’s Toledo Assembly Complex will receive nearly $400 million to build a new midsize truck beginning in 2028, adding over 900 positions.

Michigan will host two significant initiatives. The Warren Truck Assembly Plant will invest nearly $100 million to produce a new range-extended electric vehicle combined with a gasoline-powered large SUV starting in 2028, adding more than 900 jobs. Additionally, the Detroit Assembly Complex will receive $130 million to begin producing the next-generation Dodge Durango in 2029.

Indiana will continue engine manufacturing with more than $100 million invested in Kokomo facilities to produce the all-new four-cylinder GMET4 EVO engine beginning in 2026, supporting over 100 new positions. The engine represents Stellantis’ commitment to maintaining manufacturing of strategic powertrains domestically.

The automaker emphasized that these investments include research and development costs, supplier expenditures necessary to execute its full product strategy, and manufacturing facility improvements. State and local government approvals remain required before funds are deployed, though the company expressed confidence in negotiations.

Analysts noted the investment arrives amid significant tariff pressures on imported vehicles and components. Stellantis has projected tariffs will cost the company approximately $1.7 billion this year. By consolidating American production, the company potentially reduces exposure to these costs while gaining access to government incentives and consumer preferences for domestically manufactured vehicles.

The announcement represents part of broader industry reshoring efforts. General Motors and Ford have announced comparable investments, with GM recently moving production from Mexico to three American plants and Ford investing $2 billion in Kentucky for electric vehicle production.

Stellantis supports approximately 48,000 American employees across 34 manufacturing facilities, distribution centers and research sites spanning 14 states. The company operates 2,600 dealerships and works with roughly 2,300 suppliers throughout thousands of American communities.

“Even the seasons form a great circle in their changing, and always come back to where they were. The life of a man is a circle from childhood to childhood, and so it is in everything where power moves.”

— attributed to Black Elk (1863-1950)

The environmental movement lost a champion with the Sept. 16 passing of local activist and preservationist Paul Gallimore. With his life partner, Pat, Paul co-founded the Long Branch Environmental Education Center, protecting 1,435 acres in the Newfound Mountains starting in the 1970s and showcasing permaculture practices.

An Appalachian Sustainable Agriculture Project farm, Paul grew organic berries and apples and helped to introduce blight-resistant chestnut trees. He built passive solar structures, microhydro power systems and a trout pond, and created compost to add nutrients to the soil. The center is open to the public and mentors participants in ecological practices, while nourishing their souls in the beauty of nature.

Harmony with nature

Paul had great reverence for the Native Americans who initially occupied this land and quoted Black Elk in his 2007 work, Healing Appalachia: Sustainable Living Through Appropriate Technology, co-authored with Al Fritsch, founder of the Appalachia-Science in the Public Interest, a small nonprofit in Kentucky. That publication details sustainable efforts that can be implemented to live in harmony with nature, including solar, photovoltaics, wind power, food production and preservation, silviculture, water irrigation and conservation, among others.

Paul was a champion for respecting the myriad of life forms that occupy our mountains and worked tirelessly to oppose a state law that permitted the slaughtering of 50-pound black bear cubs. (The N.C. Wildlife Resources Commission redefined a bear cub as one weighing 75 pounds or less, thereby protecting smaller cubs from hunting, in 2016.) He revered the songs of birds, the diversity of reptiles and the presence of mammals on his land.

Acting locally

My personal experience with Paul began before I had the opportunity to make Western North Carolina my home. I visited his Buncombe County mountain paradise and was awed by its involvements and Paul’s encyclopedic knowledge of the natural world. I subsequently worked with Paul in the mid-1980s to found Save the Mountains, a citizens group opposing the U.S. Department of Energy’s proposal to site a three-county, high-level nuclear waste dump with an epicenter in Big Sandy Mush. Later serving on the district staff of U.S. Rep. Jamie Clarke, I realized how serious this proposal had been and how instrumental our efforts and those of thousands of local concerned citizens had been in stopping this siting.

My later efforts included working with Paul to encourage the co-composting of the organic fraction of Buncombe County’s landfill with clean sewage sludge from the nearby Metropolitan Sewage District (MSD), resulting in a rich soil amendment. This concept was rejected, and MSD instead built a sludge incinerator at its Woodfin facility.

When decisions were being made regarding the siting of a new landfill, Paul worked closely with residents and the county’s solid waste committee to advocate incorporating the state’s solid waste management priorities to first reduce waste, then reuse, recycle, compost and (last) landfill it. He introduced national and international experts to discuss the advantages of large-scale municipal waste recycling and composting programs as prototypes that could be implemented. These initiatives were not followed, and the county acted only to site another landfill.

As the 40-plus-year warnings of the effects of global climate change become lead disaster stories on the evening news, and our own area has been devastated by the fury of Tropical Storm Helene, I lament that the insight and common sense of individuals like Paul Gallimore have not been heeded. The greatest tribute we can provide his legacy is to pursue “good trouble” in our civic engagements and practice sustainability in our own lives.",https://mountainx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/favicon-1.png,N,,2025-10-18 17:11:44.545073

DHL Express announced the rollout of 45 new all-electric, zero-emission Mercedes-Benz eSprinter vans into its U.S. pickup and delivery fleet, signifying the first U.S. expansion of the global partnership, with more than 10,000 eSprinters now integrated into DHL’s fleet.

All vehicles are expected to be delivered by the end of October 2025, and will be deployed across key metropolitan markets, including Chicago, Illinois; Indianapolis, Indiana; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Elizabeth, New Jersey; and Moonachie, New Jersey.

While the new eSprinters promise a 206-mile range, DHL has consistently seen them exceed 240 miles, making them the longest-range battery electric vehicles in DHL’s U.S. fleet to-date. This extended capacity makes them ideally suited for inner city logistics while expanding their potential use in longer delivery routes. The vans also offer significant cargo capacity, enabling efficient last-mile delivery without compromise on payload or operational reliability.

To support the integration of these vehicles, DHL has also installed on-site charging infrastructure at its facilities in these markets, enabling drivers to conveniently recharge the vans between routes. The addition of this infrastructure ensures operational efficiency, maximizes vehicle uptime, and provides the foundation for future fleet electrification as the company scales its use of electric vehicles in the U.S.

“Electrifying our fleet is one of the most visible and impactful ways we are moving toward a more sustainable future,” said Greg Hewitt, CEO of DHL Express U.S. “The Mercedes-Benz eSprinter brings an extended range and proven cargo capabilities that allow us to serve our customers with zero emissions, while also advancing our global goal of more sustainable logistics. These vehicles not only strengthen our operations in major U.S. cities but also set the stage for future electric fleet growth across the Americas.”

“The eSprinter represents the next generation of electric mobility for commercial fleets – combining range, cargo capacity, and reliability in a way that meets the demands of modern logistics,” said Jee-Seop Kim, Managing Director of Mercedes-Benz Vans North America’. “We’re proud to see our partnership with DHL Express expand into the U.S., where the eSprinter’s performance and versatility will support their high-efficiency operations.”

The deployment supports DHL’s global Sustainability Roadmap, which includes a target to electrify 66% of its last-mile delivery vehicles by 2030. This effort includes fleet electrification, the expansion of carbon-neutral facilities, and the increased use of sustainable aviation fuels, among other initiatives.

Today, it serves as a living laboratory for climate science, a place where melting glaciers, thawing permafrost, and changing ecosystems offer a glimpse into the Earth’s future.

Across its vast landscape — spanning 663,300 square miles — Alaska compresses global environmental challenges into one dramatic microcosm. Its mountains, tundra, and coastlines reveal how warming transforms not just local communities, but the entire planet. Scientists from around the world travel there to study these transformations, and their findings are reshaping what we know about climate change.

Here are some of the lessons the world is learning from Alaska, the frontline of a changing planet.

Glaciers are the Planet’s Thermometers

Alaska’s glaciers are among the fastest-melting in the world, losing about 66.7 billion tonnes of ice each year as of 2021. If all of Alaska’s glacier ice were to melt, the resulting meltwater would contribute approximately 46.4 mm to global sea-level rise. Glaciers around the world are vanishing faster than scientists can study them with 40% – 90% projected to disappear by the end of the century if current warming trends continue.

Glaciers act as natural climate records with each layer of compacted snow containing trapped air bubbles that can reveal what Earth’s atmosphere was like in the past. Ice cores, cylindrical samples of ice drilled from ice sheets or glaciers, act much like tree rings because they provide records of past environmental conditions. When scientists drill ice cores, they can track carbon dioxide levels, volcanic activity, and temperature shifts over thousands of years.

In August 2025, the rapid melting of Alaska’s Mendenhall Glacier led to the formation of a meltwater lake known locally as Suicide Basin, near Juneau. This ice-dammed basin periodically overflows as meltwater builds up and forces its way beneath the thinning glacier, which is losing roughly 100-150 feet of ice each year. When the pressure becomes too great, the basin drains suddenly, triggering destructive floods downstream. Because the sides of the lake are fragile, this sudden release can sweep up large amounts of sediment, posing a threat to buildings and infrastructure.

Sea ice and glaciers help keep the Earth cool by reflecting sunlight back into space, reducing the amount of heat absorbed by the planet. Without this reflective surface, the exposed water absorbs more heat, warming further and causing more ice to melt — a self-reinforcing cycle. The retreat of glaciers and the flooding of Alaska’s Mendenhall River serve as stark warnings of the global consequences of climate change. As these massive ice formations shrink, they accelerate sea-level rise, threaten the livelihoods and safety of coastal communities, and disrupt ocean circulation patterns that regulate the planet’s climate.

Thawing Permafrost = Unlocks Carbon

An estimated 85% of Alaska’s land is covered by permafrost — frozen ground that stores about twice as much carbon as is currently present in Earth’s entire atmosphere

When permafrost thaws, it releases carbon dioxide and methane, two potent greenhouse gases that intensify global warming. Researchers from the University of Alaska Fairbanks stated that the current thaw rates are accelerating. In just a few decades, previously solid ground has subsided into “thermokarst” landscapes that are uneven, soggy terrain where forests tilt and collapse.

This thawing sets up a self-reinforcing feedback loop: warming causes permafrost to melt, which releases massive stores of greenhouse gases (CO₂ and methane). Those emissions further warm the climate, accelerating permafrost degradation in a cycle known as the permafrost carbon–climate feedback. Given the vast carbon reservoirs locked in Arctic soils, many scientists warn this is one of Earth’s potential tipping points and Alaska’s rapidly changing landscapes provide a clear warning of how close we may be to crossing it.

Adapt or Die

Melting permafrost and the significant loss of reflective snow and ice, which leads to less sunlight being reflected and more heat being absorbed, a phenomenon also known as Arctic Amplification, is driving massive change in the region on many levels.

Alaska’s ecosystems and its people are adapting faster than almost anywhere else in the world. As the Arctic warms 3.5 times the global average, climate change is disrupting animal populations, and entire food webs are reorganizing.

For instance, salmon are now moving into rivers that were previously too cold to support them, altering local ecosystems. Yet even as their range expands, overall salmon populations are declining, which is disrupting Indigenous fishing patterns that have been practiced for centuries. The same warming that shifts salmon habits is also thawing permafrost, destabilizing infrastructure — from homes to pipelines — and forcing towns like Newtok to relocate.

Another example is the changing migration patterns of bowhead whales. As sea ice recedes, these whales are delaying their migrations. Once reliant on the Bering Sea’s winter feeding grounds, many now remain in the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas year-round, adapting their diets as the shifting ice affects the availability of krill and zooplankton. What’s happening in Alaska offers a glimpse of the environmental, economic, and social transformations that other regions may face in the coming decades.

Alaska’s Lessons

Alaska is no longer just America’s last frontier but the world’s first warning system. Its glaciers, permafrost, and ecosystems are teaching us that climate change isn’t a distant threat but a present reality. The data collected in Alaska informs climate models used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and guides global policy decisions.

As scientists often say: what happens in Alaska doesn’t stay in Alaska. The state’s landscapes, rich in both beauty and evidence, reveal the story of a planet in transition and reminds us that the choices we make now will determine how that story ends.

Our precious living laboratory is under threat now more than ever. Ironically new fossil fuel drilling projects are planned across Alaska — already one of the most climate-vulnerable regions on Earth. These developments risk accelerating environmental damage further in a place that offers critical insights into our planet’s future.

So much for “at the speed of business.” Nonetheless, the governor followed up with a flurry of actions.
In northwestern Pennsylvania, the fruits of permit reform have yet to be realized in the conventional oil and gas industry.
“The Pennsylvania permitting process has not improved at all for conventional oil and gas operators,” says Tyler Martin, environmental care coordinator for Cameron Energy, in Warren County.
Robindale Energy has 20 years’ worth of fuel to fire its plants, limestone feedstock for pollution controls, and disposal space for ash.","On Aug. 12, 2024, Gov. Josh Shapiro introduced the Streamlining Permits for Economic Expansion and Development (SPEED) program, which was supposed to expedite the permitting process for businesses.

“Pennsylvanians deserve a state government that moves at the speed of business and processes their permits quickly to ensure Pennsylvanians receive a timely response,” Shapiro said.

Yet, SPEED was not as nimble as its acronym suggested. Pennsylvania’s Department of Environmental Protection (DEP), the agency responsible for SPEED, did not start accepting applications until almost one year later.

So much for “at the speed of business.”

Nonetheless, the governor followed up with a flurry of actions. By the end of summer, the administration had issued at least a half dozen news releases, claiming progress in permitting and licensing issues. The DEP website lists eight programs, all intended to improve the state’s process for handling tens of thousands of permit applications annually.

DEP’s “PAyback” program, which promises refunds of application fees if approval deadlines are missed, reported that only two approvals were overdue as of September and that no fees had been refunded since the program’s launch nearly two years ago.

Still, the impact of Pennsylvania’s permitting reform remains selective at best.

“As far as the governor’s ‘get stuff done’ marketing goes, we’ve seen no improvement in the speed of approvals for permit applications or renewals,” says Jim Panaro, executive vice president of Robindale Energy. Robindale recovers and hauls millions of tons of fuel from mine-reclamation sites to its three waste-coal power plants in southwestern Pennsylvania.

Panaro said DEP had apparently taken quicker-than-usual action on an air-quality permit for a new natural gas-fired power plant at Homer City. However, he wondered whether that would have been the case for a less “politically sensitive” project.

In northwestern Pennsylvania, the fruits of permit reform have yet to be realized in the conventional oil and gas industry.

“The Pennsylvania permitting process has not improved at all for conventional oil and gas operators,” says Tyler Martin, environmental care coordinator for Cameron Energy, in Warren County. “Sometimes there are still unnecessary delays.”

For example, the state’s process for identifying potential effects on endangered species has become more difficult, according to reports from both Martin and oil and gas driller Tim Howard from neighboring McKean County. Howard questions why his company needs to go through the process on land it already owns when there is no such requirement for a landowner building a home.

The endangered species regulation led Northampton Fuel Supply, near Wilkes-Barre, to relocate more than 2,000 cubic yards of rock, leftover from previous mining activities, to create bat habitats. “We were fortunate to have the material available,” said Hank Zielinski, Northampton’s vice president.

Regarding permits, Zielinski says DEP appears to do its best to balance conflicting demands. But staffing shortages have contributed to delays in permit renewals. He expects to test the state’s procedures when Northampton files this fall for the first time in seven years an application for a new surface-mine permit.

“My biggest concern is the retirement of experienced professionals at DEP who are familiar with the issues and share our interest in cleaning up waste-coal sites,” he said.

While Pennsylvania’s permitting successes remain limited, some glimmers of hope have been detected by Robindale Energy’s Panaro, who reports a positive “shift in attitude” on the part of federal regulators since the election of President Donald Trump. When DEP takes its lead from the new leadership at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, state regulators “have become more reasonable,” says Panaro.

For instance, two Robindale Energy plants had been under pressure to install $600 million in pollution controls based on a questionable claim that their emissions contributed to hazy air on a few days a year in Virginia and New Jersey. Panaro says “the conversation has gone away” in recent months, although regulatory agencies haven’t issued a definitive ruling yet.

Robindale Energy has 20 years’ worth of fuel to fire its plants, limestone feedstock for pollution controls, and disposal space for ash. But the regulatory certainty to assure decades of operation remains heavily dependent on the political will of state and national leaders.

But rather than deal with the ever-changing winds at the federal level, Pennsylvania lawmakers–Shapiro included–must stop paying lip service to “moving at the speed of business” and enact genuine, universal regulatory reform. No more piecemeal approach that selectively picks and chooses winners in the marketplace. No more gimmicky acronyms that don’t produce results.

Instead, Pennsylvania businesses need an efficient and predictable regulatory environment–one that genuinely moves at the speed of business.

The Oracle explains the stakes: higher temperatures disrupt eons of partnerships between the plants and animals who depend on precise cycles of temperature, nutrients and sunlight to stay alive. She reminds me the sources of food I take for granted are no exception.

She informs me the cost of our energy and food will rise at the same time we increase carbon emissions. I mention a story I saw in the Springfield Daily Citizen: Springfield City Utilities will spend $230 million in ratepayer dollars to build a new natural gas electrical generation plant.

Southwest Power Pool requiring carbon-based generation

We’re told the transmission authority we partner with (Southwest Power Pool or SPP) requires new generation to be carbon-based. Tragically, the area SPP governs is the Saudi Arabia of renewable energy: regional, unlimited, inexpensive wind and solar energy.

And so, CU is instead plowing a ton of money (and raising rates) for a facility to burn natural gas at the exact moment the U.S. is expanding natural gas shipments to Europe to replace Russian sources.

The Oracle predicts the cheap domestic price for natural gas will rise accordingly.

She asks me: Does it really matter how much you pay for a razor? The real cost over time is blades. Similarly, a $230 million capital cost is nothing compared to the cost of the pollution caused by the natural gas we will burn to meet the needs of a growing population.

I mention the fastest growing, cheapest and most reliable form of new generation around the world is solar — with wind a close second. These new sources of electricity become “base load” (reliable and predictable) when you couple them with utility scale batteries. CU did announce 36 megawatts of new batteries but for a city utility with a remarkable combination of renewable energy and low rates, their new carbon-emitting generators are a giant step backward. (Editor’s note: In 2024, City Utilities reported 34% of its delivered energy came from renewables, primarily wind. It has pledged to be “net zero carbon” by 2050.)

Let’s hope we never use it

As utility bills spike across the country, the best outcome for Springfield would be this: we bought a $230 million mistake but we will never use it.

The Oracle knows history. She predicts nothing good can come from linking our utility bills and our region’s future to a never-ending war in Europe. “Foolish humans” she murmurs over the sound of spring water bubbling over mossy boulders.

I can see she is busy with the Fall transition: leaves to colorize; turtles to burrow in the mud; wild bees to complete their nests and then perish; fur coats to thicken and seeds to drop and sleep in soil blankets.

The 11-year-old firm had been rapidly expanding over the last couple of years alongside growing market interest in lithium, copper and other minerals needed for electric vehicles and other clean-energy uses.

The layoffs include at least 40 people at Benchmark, the three sources said, out of a total workforce of 200 people. Two of the sources said affected departments included sustainability, sales and marketing.

CEO Andrew Miller in an email to Reuters said the firm had undergone a “recent restructuring.” He declined to comment further on Reuters questions regarding the reductions.

“This process is part of our ongoing efforts to strengthen the quality and delivery of Benchmark’s offering, focused around further investment in our technology and AI capabilities,” he said.

One source cited weak pricing for minerals, especially battery metal lithium, as a drag on Benchmark’s business, whose clients include miners, battery makers and politicians.

Lithium prices have plunged since their peak in 2022 due to slower-than-expected adoption of electric cars.

In a research note Benchmark published on its website last week, the company said it expected a sharp decline in U.S. EV sales in the last quarter of the year. It added that other challenges such as high manufacturing costs and rising tariffs are prompting some carmakers to scale back EV production plans into next year.

ASBN summit channels 'No Kings Day' momentum into policy advocacy, welcoming business leaders, investors and citizens committed to strengthening democracy

Protests are essential to democracy, but protest alone is not enough. The energy demonstrated in our streets must translate into sustained policy advocacy to create meaningful, lasting change.”

— Camilla Taylor, Executive Director, American Sustainable Business Network

WASHINGTON, DC, UNITED STATES, October 18, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- As millions take to the streets today for 'No Kings Day'—one of the largest demonstrations in American history—the American Sustainable Business Network (ASBN) recognizes this powerful bipartisan moment and the critical work that must follow.

ASBN's summit, Business, Policy and Purpose: The Business of Democracy (October 21-23), will harness this historic momentum and channel it into concrete action through policy advocacy and democratic engagement.

""Protests are essential to democracy, but protest alone is not enough,"" said Camilla Taylor, Executive Director of ASBN. ""The energy demonstrated in our streets must translate into sustained policy advocacy to create meaningful, lasting change. It's time to work together across party lines for our democracy—and we're ready to lead the work.""

A Bipartisan Gathering for Democracy

Over three half-days (Oct 21-23, 12-3:30 PM ET), the virtual conference brings together over 80 speakers and hundreds of business leaders, policymakers, investors, and advocates in a bipartisan effort to strengthen democracy. The conference will provide tools, business networking opportunities, and strategies to turn commitment into action.

Powerhouse Speakers: Rick Steves (Rick Steves' Europe) discusses what 50 years of travel has taught him about responsible business and democracy. Paul Rice (Fair Trade USA), the original rebel in the boardroom, addresses building resilience during adversity. Jamie Ager (North Carolina Congressional candidate, Farmer) shares grassroots perspectives in challenging the status quo. Prominent women leaders include Mindy Lubber (Ceres), Fran Seegull (Impact Investing Alliance), Mia Ketterling (Pinterest), Kate Ogden (Seventh Generation), Skye Perryman (Democracy Forward), and many more.

From 'No Kings Day' Demonstration to Implementation

Day 1 (October 21): Business as a Force for Democratic Resilience – Explore how advocates can strengthen democratic institutions through strategic engagement with practical frameworks for responsible political involvement.

Day 2 (October 22): Rewriting the Rules for an Inclusive Economy – Learn strategic advocacy techniques, policy engagement frameworks, and coalition-building strategies.

Day 3 (October 23): Building Community Power and Collective Action – Transform values into action through mobilizing community networks and creating lasting social change.

Accessible Participation

ASBN offers a 3-Day Pass ($250), a 1-Day Pass ($87), and free admission for ASBN members. All passes include recordings for on-demand replays. Equity pricing and a limited number of press passes are available.

Since Oct. 1, hybrid or electric vehicles are no longer allowed to use the lane without passengers.
Sept. 30 was a big day for the electric vehicle industry, as electric vehicle tax credits, a tax break that offered a credit of up to $7,500, were also discontinued.
These federal decisions remove the emphasis of electric vehicles in NY’s automotive market; meanwhile, the state is attempting to promote them.
Electric vehicles make up a relatively small portion of total registered vehicles–around 1%.","On Sept. 30, the Clean Pass Program, a pilot program that allowed drivers of alternatively-fueled vehicles to bypass the Long Island Expressway HOV lane’s multi person requirement and utilize the lane as the vehicles sole occupant ended.

The program was extended by the Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Act in 2016, and when it expired on Sept. 30, it was not renewed. Since Oct. 1, hybrid or electric vehicles are no longer allowed to use the lane without passengers.

Launched in 2006, the program was meant to incentivize more drivers to transition to “environmentally friendly, fuel-efficient vehicles to promote energy independence, lower fuel consumption, and improved air quality.” According to New York State Energy Research and Development Authority numbers, New York has over 300,000 electric vehicles on the road and millions of dollars devoted to supporting the vehicles through more charging stations and update facilities.

Sept. 30 was a big day for the electric vehicle industry, as electric vehicle tax credits, a tax break that offered a credit of up to $7,500, were also discontinued. These federal decisions remove the emphasis of electric vehicles in NY’s automotive market; meanwhile, the state is attempting to promote them. This places the state further from achieving its ambitious goal of having all new passenger cars, pickup trucks and SUVs sold in NYS be zero emissions by 2035. A gasoline-fueled passenger vehicle that drives 11,500 miles per year emits 4.6 metric tons of carbon dioxide annually.

With state actions weakened by federal moves, state resources are wasted and less efficient. Electric vehicles make up a relatively small portion of total registered vehicles–around 1%. To increase this number and thereby reduce reliance on gasoline, initiatives like the Clean Pass Program and EV tax credits were a perk for customers to spend the extra money on a hybrid or electric vehicle.

Traffic is looking different on the Long Island Expressway, and owners of electric vehicles should be aware of the change to save themselves the $150 that they would lose if caught using the HOV lane.",https://tbrnewsmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/HOV_lane_.jpg,N,,2025-10-18 15:01:41.631246

Districts across the state will receive 10 propane and 87 electric buses, which will replace older diesel-powered buses in 23 school districts.
A third round investment of the Clean Bus Energy Grant, totaling $35.9 million, paid for the 100 additional buses.
The Environmental Protection Agency provided states with $5 billion over five years to create the Clean School Bus Program.
""Our goal was to really target those areas so that we can remove a lot of those diesel buses and replace those with cleaner emission vehicles.""","Thousands of diesel-powered school buses drive down Michigan roads each morning. Soon, that number will dwindle just a little, thanks to a $125 million grant from the Michigan Department of Education (MDE).

Districts across the state will receive 10 propane and 87 electric buses, which will replace older diesel-powered buses in 23 school districts.

The program is a partnership between the MDE, the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy (EGLE). It's received support from environmental advocacy groups like It's Electric! and Michigan Association of Pupil Transportation (MAPT).

A third round investment of the Clean Bus Energy Grant, totaling $35.9 million, paid for the 100 additional buses.

The Environmental Protection Agency provided states with $5 billion over five years to create the Clean School Bus Program. Michigan's program was ""created after that to kind of help fill the gaps that we felt the federal program was missing,"" Kindra Weid, the Coalition Coordinator of It's Electric, said.

Public schools could apply for the grant. A primary goal of increasing the number of cleaner-powered buses was to reduce diesel emissions, which are a detriment to air quality. EGLE found which areas of the state were most polluted through mapping tool MI EJScreen, Troy Hansbarger, MDE's Manager of Office of Health Safety, said.

""Our goal was to really target those areas so that we can remove a lot of those diesel buses and replace those with cleaner emission vehicles.""

Asthma is a leading cause of absenteeism, according to the state health department. Each year, as a result of asthma, about 1 in 8 Michigan students miss more than six days of school. Diesel exhaust is a common trigger of asthma.

""And so, that's like a big driver for why we want cleaner buses,"" Weid said. ""Some kids throughout rural Michigan are on the bus for a very long time, and that means that their exposure to diesel exhaust is extensive on the drive in and the drive home.""

Katrina Morris, the executive director of MAPT, is from West Shore Educational Service District in Northwest Michigan. She transports about 130 students across distances the size of Delaware. She hopes the cleaner-powered buses will yield quieter rides, which provide a better environment for students susceptible to sound issues.

""We carry a lot of severely, multiply impaired children that have severe needs, medical needs,"" Morris said. ""And so this will help them to be able to have that safer ride, which is what we are all here for.""

Already, though, the program has faced challenges at the federal level. Districts relying on federal funding were ""left in the dark,"" Hansbarger said.

They didn't know when those funds were to be released, so they didn't know how much they had available to them. So, they didn't know how much they needed from Michigan to complete their projects.

Other districts had chosen a bus company, like Lion Electric, that stopped servicing the U.S.

Not all the cleaner-powered buses have been purchased or entered into service yet. The grant will provide a final $44 million round of investment. Applications are due Dec. 18.

Tesla Valuation Stays Steady

The Q3 2025 results report will take place next week on October 22 after the closing bell.

Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) ended the week at $439.31 share, extending a consistent climb to more than 6% this year and 95% over the past 12 months. Does Wall Street strength indicate that Tesla might exceed what had been cautious forecasts for Q3 2025? Once-dour Tesla analyst expressions seem to be slightly revised, with some projecting Tesla will report third-quarter earnings per share of $0.54, down from $0.72 a year earlier.

Tesla delivered 497,099 cars (481,166 Model 3/Y and 15,933 other models) worldwide in the third quarter, setting a new record. The figure rose 7.4% from the year-ago quarter, after three consecutive quarters of year-over-year decline.

How will the new, basic Tesla Model Y and Model 3 versions stabilize numbers? Tesla has finally begun to appeal to a less affluent audience by introducing new so-called Standard versions of the Model 3 sedan and Model Y SUV priced $5,000–$5,500 less than before.

Tesla continues to be the best selling EVs in the US market, estimated at 43.1% at the end of September. Yes, those numbers are down from 49% Y2Y. The EV competition is knocking at the Austin door, shrinking Tesla’s share of the EV pie to 41% from 80% four years ago. BloombergNEF expects at least nine new electric cars and trucks priced below $40,000 in the next three years.

US residents bought 438,500 electric cars and trucks in the third quarter, as drivers raced to grab federal incentives before they expired September 30. Those sales became the highest number of EVs sold in a single quarter, amounting to 11% of all new car sales and beating the previous high point of 8.7%, according to Cox Automotive. It’s also interesting to note that nearly half of US EV purchases in the first half of the year were made without any federal incentive.

The federal tax credits did help rejuvenate Tesla. Its overall financial health equation continues to be fortified by strong brand loyalty. With earlier quarters on a roller coaster, it hasn’t hurt that Musk recently added about $1 billion worth of Tesla stock.

Tesla is positioned to look to its increasing energy generation and storage revenues as sustaining factors. The Megapack and Powerwall products continue to grow in popularity. In the third quarter of 2025, Tesla deployed 12.5 GWh of energy storage, reflecting an increase from 6.9 GWh in the corresponding quarter of 2024 and setting a new record.

But, on the less optimistic side, did a consumer rush to cash in on the credits artificially inflate Tesla value in Q3? Loss of EV federal tax incentives may have an effect on the upcoming quarter’s bottom line — the Tesla Q4 2025 report may look very different. The stock is up more than 7% for the year, but some analysts interpret that as a fleeting moment in time. Pessimists see Q4 with a stark Tesla revenue drop, which will feed into 2025 becoming the company’s first full-year decline on record.

One downward trend is Tesla’s lukewarm performance abroad. While Tesla doesn’t officially break down sales by region, as Yahoo! finance notes, the third-quarter jump is likely to have come from the US. In Europe, however, the company’s performance is flaccid, with demand on the rise from both legacy automakers and Chinese EV players.

Tesla shares did fall early in the year due to brand competition, but Musk’s boorish behavior had the most significant detrimental effect. Clearly, siding with anti-EV Trump, his DOGE damage to federal careers and alleged data theft, and his outspoken support of Germany’s AfD party pushed Tesla stock to new lows.

The market for used EVs is also booming and could become an offsetting factor in new EV sales.

Musk’s Pay Package: Back in the Courts

This week the Delaware Supreme Court heard another iteration of arguments about Musk’s record-setting pay package. The saga began in 2018. In lieu of a salary, Tesla gave Musk incentives to help the company grow and prosper at the rate of 10× that year’s valuation. Tesla states that Musk, indeed, met those goals in 2022.

But not everyone was impressed. The Tesla board of directors was accused of violating their fiduciary duty to act in the best interests of shareholders and the company overall. With so much board influence, the thought was that the board couldn’t objectively analyze Musk’s actual performance. A lack of alleged board transparency about informing shareholders also fed into the case, with various board members’ personal ties to Musk not fully revealed.

Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) has recommended that Tesla investors vote against Musk’s colossal pay package, describing it as ‘excessive’ and insufficiently tied to safeguards for shareholders.

Judge Kathaleen McCormick determined that the amount to be awarded Musk was an “unfathomable sum,” and she instructed Tesla to rethink the compensation package. Shareholders in 2024 didn’t listen and passed it again. The volley back to McCormick didn’t work out as shareholders wished, as she rejected that vote, too. A new vote, she stated, wasn’t what she asked for: developing a new plan.

Now it’s up to Delaware’s State Supreme Court. Could it be construed that Musk influenced the board but did not control it?

Tesla’s board of directors now has a new, future compensation package on the table for Musk. Hear ye, hear ye: all bow to the world’s first trillionaire.

Here are the best ten EV lease deals in October 2025.
However, the lease rate in this case is $551 per month over 48 months, with $8,510 due at signing.","The removal of the EV tax credit was thought to pose an existential threat to the adoption of electric vehicles in the US. The sentiment was even more acute because many legacy carmakers had signaled they wanted to scale back their EV plans way before the tax credit ended. However, many people will continue to purchase EVs in the future, and the adoption rate is expected to accelerate.

Not all carmakers are on board with electrification, but those who bet on EVs will reap the benefits. This might explain why many appear unfazed by the new market conditions. There are still great deals on EVs, and more pop up every day. Some carmakers have adjusted to the new reality by cutting the prices of their EVs, as they tried to compensate for the loss of the tax credit.

Hyundai is a prime example, with the 2026 Ioniq 5 starting at $35,000 and significant discounts offered on the 2025 models. Others bet on more affordable models launching into the market, such as the Chevrolet Bolt and Tesla's Model 3 and Model Y Standard.

The Detroit Three carmakers believed they could circumvent the system by purchasing the EVs directly through their financing subsidiaries. This way, they could access the federal tax credit and pass the savings on to the customer. However, this approach, while creative, backfired spectacularly when the government fought back. They have since stopped offering the tax credit savings and, in some cases, sold the vehicles through auctions.

Another reason we continue to see very tempting offers is that carmakers anticipate slow sales in the fourth quarter. Traditionally one of the best in a year, the Q4 2025 could be flat at best. That's because the expiration date on the EV tax credit prompted many who intended to buy an EV this year to do it in the third quarter. As a result, fewer people will buy a new EV in the fourth quarter.

We may not see lease contracts with monthly payments as low as $89 or $129 as we did in the past months, mainly because there will not be a tax credit to lower the costs. However, we've still found many attractive deals, with monthly payments as low as $189 for the Hyundai Ioniq 5 and Ioniq 6, both in SE Standard Range specifications. Here are the best ten EV lease deals in October 2025.

1. 2025 Hyundai Ioniq 5 SE SR

MSRP: from $44,075

Lease: from $189 for 36 months with $3,999 due at signing

The 2025 Ioniq 5 RWD SE SR model can be leased for just $189 per month over 36 months, with $3,999 due at signing. However, I urge you to consider the SE trim for a monthly rate of $199. For only $10 more per month, you get a significantly improved EV.

Instead of a 63-kWh battery providing a maximum range of 245 miles (394 km), the SE model features an 84-kWh battery pack, offering a maximum range of 318 miles (512 km). It also offers 225 horsepower, up from 168 horsepower, for the SE SR model.

Thanks to its impressive feature package, the Ioniq 5 is easily the most popular Hyundai EV. As the first model built on Hyundai's E-GMP platform, the Ioniq 5 introduced the 800-volt architecture to the masses. The main benefit is crazy-fast charging, with less than 20 minutes needed to charge from 10% to 80% when using an 800-volt DC fast charger.

2. 2025 Hyundai Ioniq 6 SE SR

MSRP: from $39,045

Lease: from $189 for 24 months with $3,999 due at signing

This funny-looking electric sedan shares the E-GMP platform with the Ioniq 5 below but adds the benefit of an aerodynamically optimized body. The Ioniq 6 boasts an impressive 0.22 drag coefficient, which is why it offers one of the longest ranges in its segment, at 342 miles (550 km). That, of course, if it's equipped with the bigger 77-kWh battery.

If the lower range (240 mi/386 km) suits your driving habits, Hyundai offers a deal on the Ioniq 6 RWD SE Standard Range. You can have it for $189 per month for 24 months, with $3,999 due at signing. For the money, you'll get a single-motor configuration with 149 horsepower and a 53-kWh battery, good for 240 miles (386 km) of range.

However, it's better to upgrade to the full EV package for $10 more per month. The Ioniq 6 SE retains the RWD configuration but with a 225-hp motor and a range estimated at 342 miles (550 km). For these benefits, the small surcharge is well worth paying.

3. 2025 Kia Niro EV Wind

MSRP: from $41,045

Lease: from $209 for 24 months with $3,999 due at signing

The Kia Niro EV is not the newest or most compelling EV, but it's worth considering at these rates. The entry-level 2025 Niro EV Wind can be leased for $209 per month over 24 months, with $3,999 due at signing. It's a lot more than it used to be for an arguably inferior EV compared to the two Hyundai EVs, but you can't be too picky these days.

The 2025 Kia Niro was launched last November, following a thorough revision in 2022. Although a little long in the tooth, the Niro EV Wind offers a decent 253-mile (407 km) range from a 65-kWh battery. The Niro EV doesn't have a heat pump fitted as standard, so be sure to purchase it with the Preserve Package ($1,300).

On the plus side, the equipment is rich, even in the Wind base trim. This includes dual 10.25-inch screens for the instrument cluster and infotainment system, an eight-speaker audio system from Harman Kardon, and a bi-tone interior theme for the Wave top trim. A comprehensive driver-assist package is also standard, making the Niro EV a compelling proposition.

4.2025 Ford Mustang Mach-E Select RWD

MSRP: from $32,435

Lease: from $219 for 24 months with $4,499 due at signing

Ford is losing money on every EV it sells, but that hasn't stopped it from selling its electric vehicles at very attractive prices. This likely explains why sales have increased recently, despite strong competition from Tesla, GM, and Hyundai/Kia. The 2025 Mustang Mach-E is now available with a very attractive lease contract.

The electric Mustang can be leased for $219 per month with $4,499 due at signing on a 24-month contract. There's a mileage limit of 21,000 miles for the duration of the contract, with each extra mile costing $0.20. The low monthly rate is made possible by an $8,750 incentive package that is applied to the sticker price.

In its heyday, the compact crossover has been praised as one of the best rivals to the Tesla Model Y. The Select RWD trim offers a respectable 264 horsepower, and the 73-kWh standard-range battery allows it to travel up to 260 miles (418 km) on a charge. Charging the battery from 10% to 80% takes 32 minutes.

5. 2025 Subaru Solterra Premium

MSRP: from $39,915

Lease: from $279 for 36 months with $2,278 due at signing

The 2025 Subaru Solterra still has a very attractive lease offer at $279 per month on a 36-month contract. This expires on October 31 and is available in all states except Hawaii. Although Subaru has already announced the 2026 model, it is not yet available for order.

If the 2025 Solterra looks familiar, it's because it's a Toyota bZ4X in disguise. Surprisingly, Subaru opted for a more radical redesign with the 2026 model. The changes are equally thorough under the hood, where it has incorporated the latest technology introduced by the newer Toyota bZ.

The 2025 Subaru Solterra charges from 10% to 80% in 35 minutes, which is still slower than most EVs. Subaru packs Eye-Sight with supervised hands-free driving at speeds up to 25 mph (40 kph) as standard, as well as standard roof rails with a static load capacity rated up to 700 pounds (318 kg).

6. 2025 VinFast VF 8 Eco

MSRP: from $41,100

Lease: from $279 for 24 months with $0 due at signing

VinFast is a Vietnamese carmaker that vowed to upend the US car market. However, its EVs have been harshly criticized for poor build quality and software problems. Hopefully, the carmaker has solved most of these issues. The good news is that VinFast lowered the price of the VF8, partly offsetting the loss of the tax credit.

The electric crossover retails for $41,100 in the Eco trim, compared to $47,200 previously. This makes the lease offer interesting, at $279 monthly for 24 months with a $0 downpayment. VinFast also offers a 10-year/125,000-mile bumper-to-bumper warranty and a 10-year/unlimited-mile battery warranty, providing peace of mind.

For the money, you get a Tesla Model Y-sized crossover with a standard dual-motor configuration. The Eco base variant delivers 349 horsepower, while the 87.7-kWh battery pack allows it to travel up to 256 miles (412 km) on a charge. Not quite impressive, considering that the $48,990 Tesla Model Y AWD offers 327 miles (526 km).

7. 2025 Chevrolet Equinox EV 2WD LT

MSRP: from $43,295

Lease: from $279 for 24 months with $2,229 due at signing

Surprisingly, the Chevrolet Equinox retains the monthly payments of the tax-credit era, although the downpayment has increased. At $279 per month with $2,229 due at signing, this is still a good deal. You can have it if you take delivery by October 31.

The Chevrolet Equinox EV 2WD LT has a front-wheel drive and an 85 kW battery capable of keeping the car going for 319 miles (513 km) on a charge. The battery can be charged at 150 kW, adding up to 77 miles of range in 10 minutes of charging. An optional eAWD variant with a range of 285 miles (460 km) is also offered.

While the Chevy Equinox EV looks compelling on paper, it also has the disadvantage of less polished software. GM likely ironed out many issues lately. However, it's still not on par with the industry benchmark Tesla, which makes the lack of support for Android Auto/Apple CarPlay even more painful.

8. 2025 Honda Prologue AWD Touring

MSRP: from $56,195

Lease: from $289 for 36 months with $3,899 due at signing

The 2025 Honda Prologue AWD Touring starts at $289 per month on a 36-month contract in California and other ZEV states, with $3,899 due at signing. The offer is available to owners of non-luxury car brands that are model year 2010 or newer.

For this money, you get the ""Japanese"" variant of the Chevrolet Blazer EV, sharing similar drivetrain and battery components. The Touring AWD trim features a dual-motor configuration powered by an 85-kWh battery pack, allowing it up to 294 miles (473 km) on a charge.

The Honda Prologue has a substantial advantage over its Chevy counterpart, primarily due to the support for Apple CarPlay and Android Auto that GM does not offer on its EVs. Honda claims the longest wheelbase in its class (121.8 in/3,094 mm), providing impressive cabin space.

9. 2025 Kia EV6 Light LR

MSRP: from $47,695

Lease: from $309 for 24 months with $3,999 due at signing

This costs significantly more to lease than the Kia Niro EV, but it's well worth the price. However, its biggest competitor is its Hyundai cousin, the Ioniq 5, which is much cheaper to lease. Ultimately, it comes down to how much you like the EV6's polarizing design.

The 2025 Kia EV6 Long Range RWD model in the Light trim is available for $309 per month, with $3,999 due at signing for a 24-month contract. The powertrain develops 225 horsepower from a single-motor configuration. Thanks to an 84-kWh battery pack, it can go up to 319 miles (513 km) on a charge.

The Kia EV6 boasts very short charging times when plugged into a 350-kW charger, needing only 20 minutes to charge from 10% to 80%. This is as fast as you can get on a volume model and is one of its unique selling points. As a family model, you might consider the Hyundai Ioniq 5, which offers a larger trunk. However, the Kia EV6 scores better in sportiness.

10. 2025 Ford F-150 Lightning XLT

MSRP: from $55,135

Lease: from $321 for 24 months with $6,915 due at signing

This incredible offer speaks volumes about what Ford is willing to do to sell its electric pickup truck. Although the $6,915 due at signing is rather steep, the $321 monthly payment is almost nothing for an electric truck well-equipped like the F-150 Lightning XLT.

Its only letdown is that it comes with the Standard Range battery (98 kWh), which can only go 240 miles (386 km) on a charge. If you want the most range, you'll have to splurge on the F-150 Lightning Lariat. However, the lease rate in this case is $551 per month over 48 months, with $8,510 due at signing.

Thanks to an Extended Range battery with a 131-kWh capacity, the Lariat variant can go up to 320 miles (515 km) on a charge. Even this is not enough if you want to use the truck for towing. This might explain why the electric F-150 is not as popular as its combustion-powered brother.",https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images/news/the-tax-credit-is-gone-but-electric-car-lease-deals-are-as-sweet-as-ever-in-october-2025-259402_1.jpeg,N,,2025-10-18 14:04:11.203876

Experts Weigh In: Are EVs Still Worth Buying?","On Oct. 1, 2025, the electric vehicle (EV) tax credit was eliminated by President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA). The massive bill sets the spending agenda and tax policies for the remainder of Trump’s second term, permanently extending most of the tax rates of the president’s 2017 tax bill and paying for those tax cuts by eliminating spending elsewhere (such as the EV tax credit). Find out below if EVs are still worth buying without the tax credit.

What Is the EV Tax Credit?

Part of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022, the EV tax credit incentivized new car buyers to purchase EVs by giving them a $7,500 tax credit when buying a qualifying new EV. For instance, a new $40,000 EV would ultimately cost $32,500 after the $7,500 was claimed. It was a healthy incentive, covering a significant portion of a new EV’s final cost. That incentive has now been eliminated by the OBBBA.

That’s not the only pricing issue currently facing EVs.

Tariffs Are Keeping EVs Expensive

As reported by Business Insider, even the standard versions of Tesla’s Model 3 and Model Y are no longer cheap at $36,990 and $39,990 respectively. A crucial reason for this is that many of the necessary minerals needed to construct EV batteries are both mined and processed in China, where they face a 93.5% tariff tax to come to America.

Imposing not only a steep tariff but also one with unpredictable terms makes planning extremely difficult, Travis Fisher, director of energy and environmental policy studies at the Cato Institute, told Business Insider. He also said if he were in the auto industry, considering production of electric or hybrid models and the integration of multiple batteries, he’d be unsure how to proceed.

Experts Weigh In: Are EVs Still Worth Buying?

Should you still consider an EV, even without the tax credit? According to Dave Thomas, director of content marketing and auto industry analyst at CDK Global, the answer is a hesitant yes. “If you are truly concerned [about] how much you will be paying out of pocket for the next five years, EVs will mostly likely still be the right pick,” he said.

“Many [automakers] are discounting EVs by $7,500 to offset the loss of the incentives. If you search your local dealership’s inventory you might find some with significantly bigger discounts,” Thomas explained.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Vnl3dPwxH6znN192dtBfBw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/gobankingrates_644/a599228de6616a2733d6c7be1b4589e2,N,,2025-10-18 13:02:03.643222

The other four are: reform multilateral development banks; boost domestic capacity for climate finance; find ways to mobilise private capital; and strengthen regulation of climate finance.
“Every year of delayed climate action raises both the investment needed and the risks faced,” the ministers said.
“Climate action is central to both economic stability and development,” said Matia Kasaija, Ugandan finance minister and co-chair of the Coalition.","If financial leaders act urgently to increase climate investments they could unlock a $1tr-a-year growth opportunity that would create hundreds of millions of jobs and protect lives, according to three reports on Thursday.

Two separate alliances of finance ministers called for climate finance to be magnified to the 2035 target of $1.3tr a year set by last year’s COP 29 climate summit.

Meanwhile, a consortium of 20 thinktanks, NGOs and universities said investment in climate resilience and nature projects could create more than 280m jobs in emerging and developing countries by 2035, boosting the most vulnerable states’ economies by as much as 15%.

The COP 30 Circle of Finance Ministers, coordinated by Fernando Haddad, Brazil’s finance minister (pictured), set out five priorities which it will present at the summit in Belem in November.

It said mobilising finance to hit $1.3tr would require “structured and sustained efforts” by public and private bodies. Its top priority is to scale up concessional finance and make best use of climate funds. The other four are: reform multilateral development banks; boost domestic capacity for climate finance; find ways to mobilise private capital; and strengthen regulation of climate finance.

The Circle, which includes countries as diverse as the UK and the Marshall Islands, said inaction on climate change disproportionately exposed the most vulnerable populations — which had contributed least to emissions — to “escalating climate risks”.

“Every year of delayed climate action raises both the investment needed and the risks faced,” the ministers said. “Urgent and coordinated action is indispensable to safeguard lives, livelihoods and sustainable growth.”

Meanwhile, the older 70-strong Coalition of Finance Ministers for Climate Action issued a strong case for the economic benefits of tackling global warming.

They said the pro-climate policies Coalition members had enacted had enabled their economies to seize opportunities from the transition to a low carbon, climate-resilient economy.

“Climate action is central to both economic stability and development,” said Matia Kasaija, Ugandan finance minister and co-chair of the Coalition. “Finance ministries [are] playing a more pertinent role in climate policies — aligning fiscal policy with climate priorities… and working towards a more predictable environment for unlocking the investment needed.”

The Coalition has published a database of more than 500 climate policy actions by member countries. It showed that two thirds of countries were scaling up green bonds, emissions trading systems and blended finance to mobilise private capital for climate action. One in seven was integrating climate risks into public financial management while one in 10 was introducing carbon taxes, phasing out harmful subsidies and expanding clean energy incentives.

“By aligning fiscal and general financial policies with climate objectives, we can create clear, predictable frameworks that attract investment, support innovation and ensure the transition strengthens — not destabilises — our economies,” said Marko Primorac, incoming co-chair and Croatia’s finance minister.

The Returns on Resilience report, launched by 20 partners, analysed the economic and financial benefits of investment in climate adaptation. It found that the adaptation and resilience market could reach $1.3tr annually by 2030, while saving some of the 1m-2m additional deaths expected annually by 2050 without action.

The report also calculated the cost of failing to act. Temperature and rainfall shifts have already destroyed at least $525bn of economic expansion over the past 20 years in developing nations.

Launching the report, Mia Mottley, prime minister of Barbados and architect of the Bridgetown Initiative on climate finance reform, said: “We continue to recognise that the work of building resilience is at the core of everything that we do.”

Without intervention, both sudden disasters and gradual environmental changes like biodiversity decline could cost major global corporations $1.2tr by the 2050s, amid a worldwide GDP reduction of 18% to 23%.

Reports from industry experts state that Europe hit record wind power curtailments during the first nine months of 2025. The world’s leaders have reaffirmed the need to diversify the energy sector; however, the troubling trend that has emerged in Europe points to some concerning issues that European nations will need to contend with to shift the sector towards a more inclusive stance for the wind power sector.

European grids were unable to dispatch the surge in renewable energy output during this year

The progress that the global community has made in advancing the wind sector beyond memorandum’s of understanding towards the practical implementation of projects that drive the sector forward.

While that progress is commendable, a worrying trend has emerged in Europe. When a situation arises where renewable energy output threatens to overwhelm grids, operators are often paid to reduce generation from their renewable energy assets. This has led to Europe hitting record wind power curtailments during the first nine months of 2025.

Curtialment rates have risen in several nations, including Spain, Germany, France, and southern Sweden during the first nine months of the year, underscoring the issues faced by the wind power sector in the region. Among the worrying increases in curtailment rates are:

Spain jumped to 12.2% this year from 9% last year

France increased to 5.3% from 3.8%

Germany’s curtailment rate inched up to 4.9% from 4.5%

South Sweden’s curtailment rate was 2.4%, up from 2.0% a year earlier

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said last month that the EU plans to address critical grid bottlenecks, which have exacerbated the curtailment rates in the region.

A review of the EU’s electricity grids by the European Court of Auditors has outlined the required budget for the sector

The estimation that the EU Commission has laid out notes that $2.36 trillion to $2.7 trillion is required to meet grid needs until 2050; without it, the sector will face significant shortages that could devastate the region.

President Ursula von der Leyen notes that European nations’ national grids are not well integrated, as they lack the necessary interconnectors. The curtailment rates in Europe are the polar opposite of what is taking place in the MENA region, which has seen Africa’s largest wind farm being completed ahead of schedule.

Industry insiders have echoed the problems being faced in Europe.

“Less new wind is bad news for Europe’s wider competitiveness. Industry in Europe is craving cheap electricity to compete with China and the US. But too many Governments remain half-hearted in their expansion of wind. This is not only threatening the wind sector. It’s also jeopardising jobs and growth more widely – in steel, chemicals and ICT. Doing business in Europe is so much harder for them if the EU can’t deliver on its energy targets” – WindEurope CEO, Giles Dickson

However, an innovative social enterprise is doing its bit to help by offering people the chance to reduce their electricity bills by as much as 30%.

Energy Local is a non-profit organisation that has created a way for people to benefit from local clean energy by teaming up with a renewable energy project in their area – it might be a wind turbine, solar farm or hydroelectric scheme – to get a better deal.

It enables participating residents to buy renewable electricity at a discounted price.

They form a club, which their local renewable project also joins, and it works by matching up the residents’ energy usage to the locally generated electricity. The club agrees a price residents will pay for the electricity they use when the local renewable energy is being generated.

In Bridport in Dorset, the installation of a wind turbine by the local farmer Peter Bailey in one of his fields allowed an energy club to be set up in 2021. Almost 60 people are signed up to the club, and the connection between local energy generation and usage is already having an impact on how members behave.

“Peter believes wind power of about 11mph produces sufficient power for it to generate. You know on a windy day that it’s generating power,” says Malcolm Drew, a semi-retired engineer and energy club member.

“The website we can access tells us what the turbine is doing – it picks up on wind speed and tells you how windy it is and if it’s a good time to use electricity,” he adds.

Richard Toft, who helped to found the club, says: “We’re all saving. Depending on your personal habits, people save a different proportion – anywhere between a 10% and 25% reduction on your bill.”

There are many more people interested in joining the Bridport club than available spaces but there are hopes that it can set up a solar farm based on a cooperative investment model to expand the project and allow more members to join.

Energy Local was set up by Dr Mary Gillie in 2016 after she witnessed a surprising frustration among people living in Ashton Hayes, Cheshire, who wanted their small village to become carbon neutral.

“They said: ‘Can we all just put solar power on our roofs? How do we then say that we’ve used that power?’” Gillie says.

“But at the time, we couldn’t show when they were using it. It was when smart meters began to be developed that I realised we could do that.”

There are now 36 energy clubs across Great Britain that Energy Local is involved with, stretching from Scotland down to Devon and Dorset. The idea behind them is simple. Thanks to smart meter technology, it is now possible to show how much electricity a household uses every half an hour. Energy Local has developed software that compares that usage with the electricity generated by a local renewable energy scheme such as a wind turbine, hydro project or solar farm.

Gillie and her team have worked with energy companies to negotiate a special tariff arrangement, thereby creating a “hyper-local” market that acknowledges the renewable power being generated in that area.

The price the club members pay for the electricity they use when the local clean energy is being generated is higher than the amount the renewable energy projects would normally get from selling their power to suppliers but lower than the price residents would usually pay via a regular tariff. “It’s a win-win,” Gillie says.

In Brixton, south London, Energy Local has helped unlock the potential of an existing solar project on the roof of a social housing block called Roupell Park. The photovoltaic panels on the building’s roof were installed in 2013 thanks to a community investment initiative organised by the not-for-profit organisation Repowering London.

“Everyone, as investor members, owns a piece of that kit on the roof [in Roupell Park],” says Afsheen Kabir Rashid, the co-founder and chief executive of Repowering London.

“It’s really empowering for local people. But we kept coming back to this point: how can we supply this energy locally? Energy Local has been one of the models that has allowed us to do that.

“It’s a small trial in Brixton – 18 households or so – but they have seen benefits on their energy bills already.”

Repowering London raises money for the solar panels through community shares. It believes that democratising the energy system is the fastest route to decarbonising the sector and making it fairer. “We still have huge fuel poverty in the UK,” Kabir Rashid says. “People are scared about the bills that arrive. People are disconnected from where the energy is coming from. The benefits of the extractive fossil fuel economy do not stay local in people’s pockets. But through community energy, we can bring people closer, make it visible.”

When the sun is weak or there is no wind, the energy club members have to pay a higher tariff – however, part of the aim of Energy Local is to encourage people to change their consumption habits.

Gillie says that as well as trying to support local renewable energy and reduce people’s bills, “we want to manage the electricity network as efficiently as we can … If we can get people to use more power when local generation is running or when fewer people are using it, we can solve both problems.”

Electricity demand is typically greatest between 4pm and 8pm but Energy Local encourages participants to set timers for washing machines and similar devices, and to try to move energy-intensive tasks to the times of day when local clean power generation is running at maximum levels and electricity is at its cheapest.

While the idea of hyper-local energy markets and cooperative renewable power generation may sound like a perfect solution to the energy crisis, Gillie is clear that community energy schemes cannot replace the national grid entirely.

“We need a robust overarching system to ensure the power keeps flowing,” she says. “We do as much as we can locally, but after a point [infrastructure costs] can become too expensive, and that’s where you need things to be handled at a national level.”

Those infrastructure costs, such as repairing and upgrading the cables and equipment that electrify our homes and businesses, are one reason why bills, including standing charges, have just gone up. On 1 October, the average energy price cap for households in Great Britain paying by direct debit increased by £35 to £1,755 for a typical annual dual-fuel bill.

“Our network is changing – we need to invest in it. We should have done this 15 years ago, and we’re playing catchup on a massive scale,” Gillie says.

Given the desire within the industry to wean the grid off gas turbine power stations and lower consumer prices by bringing more renewable power into play, well-integrated local energy generation sites offer a glimpse of what a more efficient, carbon neutral network may look like in the future.

How do Energy Local clubs work, and how do I join one?

They are designed to solve a problem in the electricity market: renewable energy schemes sell their power to suppliers but people living nearby are buying that electricity back for maybe two or three times that price.

An Energy Local club is legally a cooperative and is where a group of residents and a local renewable energy project team up to get a better deal for both parties.

To take part, you need a smart meter installed in your home.

The club agrees a price people will pay for the electricity they use when renewable energy is being generated locally. So they may want to run their washing machine when they know the local hydro scheme is going full pelt, for example. Sometimes it will be possible to match all the electricity someone uses to locally generated power but at other times they will use more than is available. For the extra electricity, they will be charged at different rates depending on the time of day.

The club selects a partner energy supplier that sells the extra power that members need when there is not enough local electricity generated. So those taking part will have to change to the supplier selected.

Energy Local says the savings will vary from household to household but adds: “We estimate you could save about 10% to 30% on your electricity bills.” However, club members still have to pay standing charges.

The organisation has created an online dashboard to help people manage their energy use. It can provide a forecast of how much power will come from the local renewable energy source each day.

If you would like to join an Energy Local club, there is a list on the organisation’s website of clubs that are up and running or being set up (some are now full). If there isn’t one in your area but you would like to be notified if one is set up, there is a form on the site where you can register your details. “We have clubs developing in many areas. Please let us know you are interested,” the organisation says.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4f432609de10e14df0dc391db3955f37292e1a85/802_449_3466_2774/master/3466.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=48b025ac2dd3200ab32b6fc13361a0ca",N,,2025-10-18 12:09:49.260557

Short-sighted disposal practices, meant to cheaply handle large volumes of wastewater, have led directly to increased operational expenses for everyone operating in these basins.
The immediate challenge stems from massive volumes of produced wastewater being injected into underground formations at increasingly high pressures.
Operators in East Texas commonly injected wastewater into mid-depth formations such as the Rodessa-Gloyd interval, between 4,500 and 7,500 feet deep.
Today, many injection wells are pumping wastewater at pressures above the natural fracture gradient, unintentionally fracturing formations and allowing pressurized wastewater to migrate upward and laterally into unintended zones.","The shale industry is facing an entirely predictable consequence of its own making. Across major shale-producing basins, particularly East Texas and the Permian, excessive wastewater injection practices have created areas with extreme overpressure, driving up the cost of new drilling operations and threatening the economic viability of shale production in many locations. It’s also destroying fresh water aquifers, causing earthquakes and causing whack-a-mole poisonous salt geysers, but apparently that’s not so big a concern in the state.

The irony is clear. Short-sighted disposal practices, meant to cheaply handle large volumes of wastewater, have led directly to increased operational expenses for everyone operating in these basins. This industry-wide phenomenon is effectively a textbook example of the tragedy of the commons, but hitting the oil and gas industry in its pocket book instead of regular joes. Would that climate change had the same level of attention, concern and impact.

The immediate challenge stems from massive volumes of produced wastewater being injected into underground formations at increasingly high pressures. Historically, shale producers viewed wastewater disposal as an inexpensive side operation, a cost line item small enough to remain mostly unnoticed on balance sheets. Operators in East Texas commonly injected wastewater into mid-depth formations such as the Rodessa-Gloyd interval, between 4,500 and 7,500 feet deep.

Over the years, this led to the gradual but steady buildup of subsurface pressures. Today, many injection wells are pumping wastewater at pressures above the natural fracture gradient, unintentionally fracturing formations and allowing pressurized wastewater to migrate upward and laterally into unintended zones. As pressure increases, the operational complexity of drilling new wells escalates dramatically.

The direct operational impacts are now clearly visible. Operators face increasingly frequent challenges when drilling into these overpressured formations. Elevated…",https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1200/1*SNxBV7_zil-z4JXYQWw0_A.png,N,,2025-10-18 16:03:52.599936

Republican candidate for governor Brian Shortsleeve said Healey had driven up energy costs by opposing gas pipelines and supporting fees and mandates that add to energy costs.","The order directs the Department of Public Utilities to eliminate, reduce, or mitigate any charges that do not benefit ratepayers.

Healey also urged the department to speed up the connection of solar resources to the grid before a federal tax credit expires.

The directive comes as residents face high energy costs and the state's utility regulation department undergoes leadership changes.

Gov. Maura Healey ordered utilities regulators Tuesday to start combing through gas and electric bill charges line by line to reduce or remove any that don't provide a benefit to ratepayers as they gird for the winter heating season.

""Everybody knows what we're dealing with. It's not just a Massachusetts issue, it's a problem throughout the Northeast, and we've just got to act with just incredible urgency to do everything we can to lower costs. And that means this as well, looking at bills, looking at charges, and getting rid of charges that aren't justified, that aren't providing that customer benefit,"" the governor said.

The order to the Department of Public Utilities, delivered in a letter Tuesday, calls for the department to ""review each and every charge that customers are currently paying to determine whether the charge can be eliminated, reduced or its impact mitigated."" Healey also instructed the DPU to ""rigorously review"" the rate increases proposed by utilities ""to avoid unnecessary spending and drive down costs.""

Energy bills soared for many Bay Staters last winter, exacerbating chronic cost-of-living pressures for residents and businesses that already pay some of the highest energy prices in the country and calling attention to the state clean energy and climate mandates some say are driving elevated costs. Healey already shaved $50 off April electricity bills and in March announced a series of executive actions designed to spur savings of nearly $6 billion over the next five years.

Healey said the actions she announced Tuesday add to her energy affordability agenda, which includes major legislation that fellow Democrats have been largely cool towards. The governor did not attach a timeline to her order and did not directly answer when asked if she expects that DPU would be able to take action in time to influence this winter's heating bills.

""I made my request today to the DPU. I think this is something they've got to get after right away,"" she responded during a press conference in her office. She added, ""The bottom line is that gas and electric bills are too high, too volatile, for people in the Northeast, and so we're doing everything we can within our power to cut them down.""

Energy and Environmental Affairs Secretary Rebecca Tepper said it is infrastructure and supply costs that are driving the increases in gas and electric bills.

""So what this does is to look at all the charges -- including looking at the utilities and how they're spending money on infrastructure -- and making sure that we're using it as efficiently as we can, the stuff we currently have, and that we're building stuff in a way that's the most cost effective,"" she said.

In her letter to the DPU, the governor also urged the department to hasten its proceedings that are necessary for more solar resources to connect to the grid so that Bay Staters can take advantage before the federal residential clean energy tax credit is eliminated at the end of the year.

""Massachusetts ratepayers cannot afford to lose out on the cheapest and fastest energy that can get built,"" Healey said.

Republican candidate for governor Brian Shortsleeve said Healey had driven up energy costs by opposing gas pipelines and supporting fees and mandates that add to energy costs.

""On Day One in office, I’ll end the mandates and hidden taxes that made our bills skyrocket and make affordability the driving factor in our energy policy,"" Shortsleeve said in a statement.

Healey's order to the DPU arrives to a department in flux. The governor in August announced her second shake-up of the DPU membership in about two and a half years, and that transition is in progress.

Cecile Fraser, an energy and utilities industry attorney first appointed to the DPU in 2017, was replaced last month by Jeremy McDiarmid, who had been running the national business association Advanced Energy United. Next week, Liz Anderson, the chief of the Energy and Ratepayer Advocacy Division in Attorney General Andrea Campbell's office, will take Chairman James Van Nostrand's spot as a commissioner and McDiarmid will become chair of the DPU. Staci Rubin, a longtime environmental justice advocate who worked as vice president of environmental justice at the Conservation Law Foundation before being appointed to the DPU in March 2023, is staying in place.","https://www.capecodtimes.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/08/21/NCCT/85765795007-082125-sh-21.jpg?crop=2749,1546,x0,y0&width=2749&height=1546&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-10-18 17:11:17.085964

Soil scientist Christina Hebb asked a room of solar developers to picture this scene at a conference here last week of the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), the nonprofit that advocates for the solar industry.

“Planting flowering species help re-establish pollinator habitat and increase pollinator species that not only benefits the site but will increase production and crop yields for neighbouring properties. So it’s very helpful, not to mention people driving past the solar farm and they’re like, ‘Wow, that actually looks really good,’” said Hebb.

Hebb works to manage the soil of solar projects planned, built and managed by the company she works for, McCarthy Building Companies, which develops and constructs large-scale solar projects across the country, often on former farmland.

As the United States builds and maintains more solar farms, attention is turning to how to make them more sustainable. Much of that focus is on the ground beneath the panels, where developers are learning how to manage soil to meet permit requirements, reduce costs and protect the land. Hebb saw this shift firsthand after joining McCarthy as its in-house soil scientist in 2021, following years as a consultant.

Expanding solar farms reshape landscapes and nearby communities. Building them can clear vegetation and compact soil, disturbing drainage, crops and ecosystems. More developers now recognize that healthy soil supports both local livelihoods and the durability of their projects.

Flowers help keep weeds from overtaking the soil beneath solar panels, making it easier for maintenance crews to work safely and reducing the risk of fire. But planting flowers is only one of many steps developers can take to make solar farms more sustainable.

Some solar farms have planted low-growing grasses that sheep graze on, keeping vegetation in check while providing local farmers with pasture income. Others have introduced barn owls to hunt prey that chew on wires and nest inside electrical equipment, showing how tending to both the surface and the soil can make solar energy systems more resilient.

In the Southwest, researchers have found that growing crops beneath solar panels can help both plants and panels thrive. Shade from the panels protects crops from extreme heat while moisture from the vegetation cools the panels and boosts their efficiency. Farmers in Arizona and Colorado have reported higher yields and lower irrigation needs in these so-called “agrivoltaic” systems.

These practices echo a growing body of research showing that solar projects can improve soil health and local biodiversity when managed right. A 2019 National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) study found that native grasses planted beneath solar arrays improve soil structure, reduce erosion and even help cool panels, making them more efficient.

But these examples take place after construction has begun. Hebb urged developers to care for the soil long before the first panel arrives on site.

The very first thing developers should do, according to Hebb, is to consider the topsoil—the thin, dark layer usually 5 to 10 inches deep that lets plants grow and keeps the ground healthy.

Topsoil forms slowly, with just a few inches taking hundreds to thousands of years to accumulate as rocks break down and organic matter from plants and animals builds up. It holds most of the soil’s life and fertility, containing the microbes, nutrients and moisture that plants depend on. But construction work such as grading, scraping and heavy vehicle traffic can destroy it in days by compacting the ground and stripping away its living layer.

Too often, Hebb said, solar companies mix or scrape it away when “grading,” or leveling the ground to install rows of panels, leaving behind hard soil that can’t easily recover.

Hebb encouraged developers to map and save the topsoil before building begins, removing and storing it carefully so it can be spread back later. That way, once construction is done, the soil still has the nutrients and structure needed for grasses, flowers, or grazing pastures to take root in the decades that the solar farm stands and the many more once it’s decommissioned.

“I think one policy that I would recommend is that you have to save topsoil. Whether you save all the topsoil or you save a certain amount, I think topsoil needs to be saved because it is, in our lifetime, a non-renewable resource,” Hebb explained.

So far, only a few states require that kind of soil care. In places like New Jersey, construction projects must replace at least five inches of topsoil and loosen the ground underneath to prevent compaction once work is finished. In Virginia, new solar rules require developers to map and protect prime farmland and if more than 10 acres are disturbed, they must offset the loss through conservation or practices such as preserving and replacing topsoil, decompacting soil and maintaining vegetation.

At the federal level, the Department of Agriculture’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) released a fact sheet in 2024 encouraging developers to minimize soil disturbance, preserve topsoil and plant perennial or pollinator-friendly vegetation to stabilize the land.

For now, most solar companies follow these practices voluntarily, often driven by sustainability goals or local partnerships with farmers rather than by regulation.

For Amanda Pankau, a director at the conservation nonprofit Prairie Rivers Network in Chicago, the importance could not be emphasized enough. Pankau was a panelist at the conference on land stewardship—the idea that the energy transition can heal the land instead of just using it.

Pankau works with communities in Illinois, which is home to one of the most fertile soils in the world. According to data, less than 1 percent of Illinois prairie is left.

“My father was the state soil scientist of Illinois,” she said. “I grew up understanding the wealth of our soils. They developed here in central Illinois under 10,000 to 15,000 years of prairie vegetation.”

Those ancient prairies produced the dark, carbon-rich topsoil that sustains the state’s agriculture today. But that soil, Pankau explained, has been steadily depleted by decades of industrial farming.

“Over 60 percent of our land in Illinois is used for just three crops: corn, soybeans and wheat. And most of them are grown in a way that isn’t sustainable,” she said. Fertilizers and pesticides wash into rivers, while bare fields erode in windstorms that now recall the Dust Bowl.

“We have an opportunity with solar to improve upon the status quo,” said Pankau.

Solar arrives in a landscape shaped by a history of skepticism. Pankau explained that many rural residents she’s spoken with see the technology as a threat to farmland that “feeds the world.”

But she said that argument misses a crucial fact: much of Illinois’ corn goes to ethanol, not food. And the state imports about 95 percent of what its people eat.

“Solar is borrowing the land for a certain amount of time,” she said. “It can be returned to farming in the future.”

In Illinois, state law already requires Agricultural Impact Mitigation Agreements, which dictate how solar projects handle soil and drainage under oversight from the Illinois Department of Agriculture.

“We’re lucky to have that,” Pankau said. “But there’s still room for improvement.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Ohio-solar-project_Pollinator1-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-10-18 12:10:16.038384

In contrast, propane and heating oil users should experience modest savings.

EIA’s projection comes as Oklahoma utilities prepare for fluctuating seasonal demand. The agency says the retail price of heating fuel remains the biggest factor in determining total winter expenses.

Oklahoma relies heavily on natural gas to heat homes, with nearly two-thirds of residents depending on it during colder months. Because the state both produces and processes gas locally, Oklahomans often enjoy lower heating costs than the national average.

However, natural gas markets remain volatile. Slight changes in supply or weather could affect monthly utility bills. The EIA warns that a colder-than-normal winter could drive prices upward, while milder temperatures could keep rates steady or even lower.

Electric-heated homes may see higher bills due to rising generation costs tied to increased natural gas usage in power plants.

Weather Scenarios and Economic Impacts

EIA modeled both 10% colder and 10% warmer scenarios to gauge how weather affects heating budgets. Under colder conditions, all fuel costs rise. A warmer winter benefits propane and heating oil users most, while electricity costs remain high regardless.

For the environment, biogas systems help protect our air, water and soil.
And using digested material from biogas systems, plus additional technology, can reduce or eliminate runoff of nutrients into our waterways.
Not enough people know what biogas systems are, even though they already operate in all 50 states.
Amid skyrocketing energy demand, biogas offers a clean and efficient way to produce more power.","We can’t ignore the reality: America needs more power. An explosion in new AI data center construction, a reshoring and expansion of domestic manufacturing, plus the broader increase in electrification of homes and vehicles are all putting enormous pressure on our energy grid.

At the same time, we’re coming to terms with another stark reality: America is producing more waste than ever. Organic waste from farms, food systems, landfills and wastewater has reached historic new highs.

The Environmental Protection Agency reports that municipal solid waste levels have skyrocketed by more than 230 percent over the last five decades since 1960, with a significant portion being degradable organic material like food scraps.

These two categories of challenges — the need to produce energy and manage our waste — presents a powerful opportunity: We can transform this abundant waste into biogas and natural fertilizer to meet America’s energy and agricultural needs.

Biogas is a renewable energy source created through the breakdown of organic waste such as manure, food scraps, sewage and crop residues. This process yields methane-rich gas, used to make energy, and digestate, a nutrient-rich byproduct usable as fertilizer.

Capturing this methane, which will be produced anyway if the waste isn’t managed, is good for the earth’s atmosphere as well, since methane is 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide as a greenhouse gas. We should capture as much of it as we can. Better still if the captured gas can also offset fossil fuel use for energy.

The benefits of biogas are undeniable. Biogas facilities produce energy 24/7, 365 days a year and have a reliability rate of 95 percent. Compared with solar and wind power — with approximately 25 percent and 35 percent reliability rates, respectively, depending on location — biogas provides us with one of the best options we have for sourcing power that is both reliable and renewable.

Beyond its consistent energy output, biogas plays a critical role in preserving America’s rural communities. Biogas systems can generate new revenue streams for communities and reduce costs for farmers.

By producing biogas and utilizing the leftover digestate for applications like animal bedding and natural fertilizer, farmers can achieve significant savings. This natural fertilizer, derived from digestate, can replace expensive synthetic fertilizers and has been shown to increase plant growth by 5 to 30 percent, further improving farm productivity.

For the environment, biogas systems help protect our air, water and soil. Air is improved through the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and other pollutants from fossil energy. We protect our soil by recycling nutrients back into the land instead of using fossil-derived, synthetic fertilizers. And using digested material from biogas systems, plus additional technology, can reduce or eliminate runoff of nutrients into our waterways.

Despite these benefits, biogas remains an underutilized energy source with only 10 to 15 percent of the potential systems built so far. Industry data shows that the U.S. has over 17,000 potential new biogas systems waiting to be built to reduce our waste. Fully developing this potential could power millions of homes and displace substantial amounts of fossil-fuel use, all which benefiting American farms and businesses.

A global perspective underscores this opportunity. The International Energy Agency suggests that biogas and biomethane could collectively meet 20 percent of global gas demand.

For the U.S., embracing biogas is not just an environmental imperative but also a strategic move to reduce our dependence on volatile fossil-fuel markets. Internationally, the European Union has already recognized biogas production as an effective strategy to reduce reliance on gas imports from unfriendly nations.

Even national public opinion firmly supports investment in biogas, once Americans know what a biogas system does. The data show strong bipartisan backing, with over 80 percent of Americans supporting federal investments in converting waste to energy. They view biogas as a practical, local and environmentally responsible solution.

The catch? Not enough people know what biogas systems are, even though they already operate in all 50 states. Biogas is a proven, scalable energy solution that offers numerous benefits in the process. It cuts emissions, reduces waste, strengthens rural economies and meets our rising energy demands.

Amid skyrocketing energy demand, biogas offers a clean and efficient way to produce more power. The energy we need is already in our backyard — we just need to take advantage of it.

Hyderabad: The BRS leadership on Saturday slammed the Congress administration for fostering an environment of intimidation and extortion, particularly targeting industrialists and investors, in stark contrast to the previous BRS regime’s investor-friendly policies. The latest salvo came from party working president KT Rama Rao, who on Saturday highlighted the divide in governance styles. In a social media post, he contrasted the BRS’s “red carpet” welcome extended to investors during the K Chandrashekhar Rao era with what he described as Congress’s aggressive tactics.

“This was KCR Govt in action with respect to industry captains. Now we all know how the Congress Govt is dealing with industrialists,” he wrote while posting a visual from BRS investor summits held in the past, where he, as the then Minister for Industries, was holding an umbrella for a leading industrialist. The post reads – “BRS: Welcomes investors with respect. Congress: Threatens investors with guns. The difference is clear.” Earlier on Friday, BRS leader T Harish Rao demanded a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe into what he termed a “gun culture” infiltrating the Congress cabinet. Rao alleged that internal clashes among Ministers have escalated to threats involving firearms, with close aides to the Chief Minister allegedly using intimidation tactics to extract money from businesses.

“The CM is presiding over a cabinet where guns are drawn not just in personal feuds but against those who dare to invest in Telangana,” Rao said, pointing to reports of Ministers’ associates parading armed guards during meetings with company executives.

A new round of investment totaling $35.9 million from the Michigan Department of Education’s Clean Bus Energy Grant program will help 23 schools and districts add 87 electric buses and 10 propane buses to fleets across the state, according to a community announcement.

“Children and others in their communities benefit from cleaner air,” Interim State Superintendent Sue C. Carnell, said in the announcement. “We are happy to work with our partners at the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy (EGLE) to make our state greener. The Clean Bus Energy Grant program helps us move toward Goal 3 in Michigan’s Top 10 Strategic Education Plan, to improve the health, safety and wellness of all learners.”

Grants are part of a larger effort

The new grants are the latest step in a clean-power transition for Michigan school transportation.

In 2019 and 2020, the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy awarded about $13 million in grants through its now-closed Fuel Transformation Program toward the purchase of 317 electric, clean diesel and propane school buses and support infrastructure for more than 25 districts across the state.

In November 2022, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency invested $54 million from its Clean School Bus Rebates program toward 138 new electric school buses and infrastructure for 25 Michigan school districts, from Southeast Michigan to the Upper Peninsula. The EPA’s Clean School Bus Program of grants and rebates provides $5 billion nationwide over fiscal years 2022-26.

In January 2024, three districts each received $5.9 million in Clean School Bus Program funding to buy 15 clean-powered school buses apiece. Reports at the time said five additional Michigan districts were expected to receive a total of 21 new clean buses through multistate Clean School Bus Program grants.

In May 2024, the Clean School Bus Program rebate competition announced $23.98 million to help 27 Michigan schools and districts buy 97 buses powered by electricity and three powered by propane.

Also in 2024, the Michigan Department of Education announced its first and second rounds of Clean Bus Energy Grant program funding: nearly $30 million in June to help 29 school districts and intermediate school districts buy a total of 114 buses powered by electricity, propane or natural gas; and $15.2 million in October to help 21 districts buy 40 electric buses and 17 propane buses.

Together, grants and rebates so far account for nearly 900 buses — some yet to be purchased or enter service. The funds generally cover a significant portion of the costs for vehicles and infrastructure, with the balance paid from local sources.

Cleaner buses offer many benefits

The Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy has consistently supported clean power for Michigan’s nearly 17,000 buses transporting more than 800,000 students a year.

“The commitment by state and federal governments to provide schools with more environmentally friendly buses is good for our children, good for our schools and good for our communities,” EGLE Director Phil Roos said in the announcement. “Under Governor Whitmer's leadership, we are investing in clean-powered school buses, improving air quality and freeing up schools to invest in the classroom, and advancing the goals of the MI Healthy Climate Plan. These efforts are accelerating Michigan’s transition to a prosperous, healthy, equitable, clean energy future.”

Cleaner school buses offer many benefits, according to the EPA. With no or low emissions compared to diesel engines, they result in cleaner air on buses, in bus loading areas and in the communities where they operate. Diesel exhaust can lower air quality and impact the environment and human health, especially for children who have a faster breathing rate than adults and whose lungs are not yet fully developed.

The new grants are Round 3 of the Clean Bus Energy Grant program, which to date has awarded more than $81 million to Michigan schools for buses and associated infrastructure.

Applications for a final Clean Bus Energy Grant round of up to approximately $44 million are due Dec. 18.

Schools are working together

As part of the transition to clean buses, school districts across Michigan and nationwide are sharing solutions and working through challenges together. Groups such as the Michigan electric school bus coalition It’s Electric! advocate for school districts and support regular meetings with school transportation staff.

“We have enjoyed supporting school districts as they receive funds to transition their fleets from older, dirtier diesel buses to cleaner, quieter, newer models. This is a win for schools, kids, drivers, mechanics and the surrounding community,” Kindra Weid, It’s Electric! coalition coordinator, said in the announcement. “We know change comes with challenges, but these buses are worth the effort, and school districts across Michigan are experiencing lower maintenance costs, quieter rides and improved air quality as a result of their efforts pioneering new technology.”

Katrina Morris is executive director of the advocacy group Michigan Association of Pupil Transportation.

“Safety on the school bus is my top priority,” Morris said in the announcement. “I want all kids to have a safe ride to and from school, so cleaner air for the kids, drivers and the greater community is a victory. We are grateful for MDE and EGLE for supporting this transition to cleaner school buses.”

However, those waivers would not exempt projects from the state’s energy facility siting standards.","Renewable energy advocates hope a new directive from Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek will allow such projects to beat pending federal deadlines to receive government subsidies.

Kotek’s executive order authorizes nine natural resource agencies to adopt emergency rules and take other necessary actions to expedite solar and wind energy development.

It also contains a series of instructions specifically directed at the Energy Facility Siting Council to help accomplish that goal, including foregoing federal consultations if possible and contracting with third parties to process applications, and directs the Public Utility Commission to take steps that would shorten the timeline for connecting clean energy to the power grid, among other measures.

With how much is at stake for energy reliability and economic development, the order is likely to meaningfully hasten the permitting process, said Angela Crowley-Koch, executive director of the Oregon Solar and Storage Industries Association.

“I think the governor was pretty clear in her directive to agencies to do everything under their existing authority to straight-line processes and siting, and I think they’ll do that,” she said.

But Kotek’s executive order has also caught the attention of critics who are counting on the new federal deadlines to help them run out the clock and defeat certain projects.

Projects that would convert large amounts of farmland have proven particularly contentious, with neighbors often organizing to impede regulatory approvals.

While state agencies can shorten some aspects of the permitting process, the question is whether controversial proposals will be able to clear other time-consuming barriers before federal tax credits expire.

For example, the Muddy Creek Energy Park — a solar facility planned on 1,600 acres of farmland in Linn County — must still likely undergo studies on sensitive species and wetland impacts, said Troy Jones, a neighbor who opposes the project.

“That’s a big hurdle for them to get past,” Jones said. “I don’t believe, legally, they can get anything expedited in this particular project. I’d be very surprised if they were able to facilitate this project to be accelerated.”

To qualify for federal tax credits worth 30% of project expenses, construction on renewable energy facilities must begin by mid-2026 and finish by 2030. Those that can’t start by then must be completed by the end of 2027.

Those deadlines will arrive up to five years sooner than developers originally expected due to provisions included in the Trump administration’s “One Bill Beautiful Bill” earlier this year.

Without substantial subsidies, some projects may not be financially feasible unless they can surmount bureaucratic obstacles to begin building ahead of schedule.

“I don’t believe that it pencils out without our tax dollars going to offset those costs,” Jones said of the Muddy Creek Energy Park.

It’s also doubtful that Kotek’s directive will allow the project to bypass legally mandated regulatory requirements, he said. “I don’t believe the state will take those steps, even with the executive order in place.”

Connie Lee, an opponent of the Deschutes Solar and Battery Energy Storage System Facility in Wasco County, is likewise skeptical the executive order will allow the facility to qualify for tax credits, short of waiving key requirements.

“I think it’s going to be more difficult than they anticipated,” Lee said.

The 13,600-acre facility is planned mostly in an “exclusive farm use” zone, including irrigated property of higher agricultural value, and contains wildlife habitat in which disruptions must be mitigated, Lee said.

“I don’t see how it could speed up their process at all if they still have to follow all the same rules,” she said. “It just is a very complicated process. Unless they’re going to just say, ‘We’re not going to mitigate for habitat. We’re not going to make sure that all these studies are done and examined,’ I don’t see how they could speed it up much faster.”

And given the staggering cost of installing solar panels across more than 20 square miles, Lee said she has trouble understanding how the project could proceed without federal subsidies — particularly in light of expected delays in connecting it to transmission infrastructure.

“I don’t see how they could make money if they can’t tie into the grid and produce energy,” Lee said. “Without the tax credits, I don’t see how you could afford to do the project.”

Though the Oregon Solar and Storage Industries Association is optimistic the directive will streamline permitting procedures, it’s too early to discuss the specifics regarding siting, land use and other requirements, said Crowley-Koch.

“We’re excited to work with the agencies and the governor’s office and see what’s possible,” she said.

Due to the Trump administration’s aversion to consult on renewable energy projects, for instance, it may be possible to waive certain state rules that require federal involvement, she said.

“Unfortunately, those federal agency staff members are not picking up the phone anymore. They’re not answering emails,” Crowley-Koch said. “That’s become a real problem for projects that are trying to move along in the process.”

While renewable energy “has the potential to play a supporting role” in assuring access to affordable and reliable electricity, the Oregon Farm Bureau believes it must be developed “without compromising the viability of our agricultural lands,” said Ryan Krabill, the organization’s government affairs manager.

To that end, the Farm Bureau is concerned that Kotek’s executive order “could open the door to expedited permitting processes that have the potential to undermine long-established farmland protections,” he said.

The state government must ensure that any projects fast-tracked under the directive fully comply with the land use planning laws and avoid construction on productive farmland, Krabill said.

“Farmers must not be made to bear the unintended consequences of rushed decision-making,” he said.

But the farmland preservation group 1000 Friends of Oregon doesn’t consider it likely that Kotek’s executive order will undermine land use protections, said Jim Johnson, its working lands policy director.

“It doesn’t affect any of the approval criteria,” Johnson said. “There’s only so much that this can change, ultimately.”

The governor can’t unilaterally change the law, so any action that amounts to “super-siting” solar and other renewable energy projects on farmland would require legislative action, he said.

The directive is more likely to prompt regulators to move certain projects “up in the queue” for permitting, for example, or to conduct required wildlife analysis in a more timely manner, Johnson said.

“What it’s going to do is tell agencies to give these priority and to try to speed it up. It doesn’t change the law,” he said. “In fact, the legislature could only change the law.”

When asked for concrete examples of the directive’s practical effects, the governor’s office pointed to a provision in the executive order that calls for the state’s Energy Facility Siting Council to hold additional meetings to expedite permitting.

Under another provision, certain civil penalties could be waived for regulatory violations, as long as they’re limited to the “minimum disturbance necessary” for solar and wind projects to begin construction by the federal deadline.

However, those waivers would not exempt projects from the state’s energy facility siting standards.

The governor’s office is also compiling a list of eligible project that are likely to meet the executive order’s criteria, which should be finished later this month, said Anca Matica, its communications and policy advisor.

“The directive to agencies is that the highest priority should be given to projects that have secured power purchase interconnection agreements and can demonstrate the project will provide benefits to Oregon ratepayers,” she said.",https://capitalpress.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2025/10/36293687776_91922114ba_k.jpg,N,,2025-10-18 14:03:49.407857

""This transition can generate significant local health benefits by delivering cleaner and more efficient heat for industrial settings.
Educational efforts, policies, and investments in more efficient industrial technologies will yield major benefits for American communities and American manufacturers.""","A new study from the American Lung Association revealed the potential cost and health savings if U.S. manufacturers replaced thousands of industrial boilers with heat pumps.

According to the report, summarized by Canary Media, a gradual transition to heat pumps would save Americans $1.1 trillion in public health costs and avoid 77,200 pollution-inflicted deaths from 2030 to 2050. The publication explained that heat pumps use electricity to transfer heat instead of relying on dirty energy sources such as coal, oil, and natural gas, which contribute to the heating of the planet and health-harming air pollution.

States with higher concentrations of people living near industrial pollution sources stand to benefit the most, according to the analysis. Florida, Pennsylvania, and North Carolina were identified as the states with the biggest estimated health benefits, with $107 billion, $82 billion, and $68 billion in projected savings, respectively. Twenty-three other states would save at least $25 billion each.

But heat pumps aren't just a solution for industry. Homeowners can implement these systems in their homes, which can save them money on utility bills. Heating and cooling are responsible for 60% of household emissions, according to Rewiring America, which adds that heat pumps are two to three times more energy-efficient than most traditional heating systems that rely on dirty energy sources. For instance, Mitsubishi, one of several companies that offer home heat pump systems, states that its devices are between 160% and 390% more efficient than gas-powered furnaces.

One other benefit of switching to heat pumps — whether at the industrial or household level — is that it cuts planet-heating pollution. Plus, this equipment delivers both heating and cooling in one package, and some heat pump users say these devices even distribute the heat in a way that feels more comfortable.

""I noticed … how different the 'comfort' feels compared to a regular furnace,"" one Redditor wrote. ""It's not blasting hot air all at once, but more of a steady, even warmth. Took me a few days to get used to, but now I actually prefer it.""

While it may seem overwhelming to find the right system for you, Mitsubishi can connect you with trained professionals in its trusted network who will help you install an efficient heat pump system.

For The Verge’s exclusive tour of these secretive labs, I watch researchers peer at cell chemistries down to the atomistic level, using electron microscopes. Others work at a larger scale, all the way up to the Megashaker. Inside a cavernous hall, an enormous sliding test chamber envelops one of GM’s double-stacked, 205-kilowatt-hour battery packs — the type that powers hulking models like the Cadillac Escalade IQ.

The 2,900-pound pack is suspended in midair from a ceiling-mounted crane, bolted to a surrounding structure to mimic its connection to a moving vehicle. Like a lithium-soaked smoothie, the battery is hydraulically shaken in the atmospherically controlled chamber, simulating anything from potholes to low-speed collisions. With dozens of test chambers for individual cells, modules, or entire packs, GM can simulate 10 years and 250,000 miles of real-world battery use and abuse in about six months.

GM can simulate 10 years and 250,000 miles of real-world battery use and abuse in about six months

That real world has become especially abusive to EVs. Some consumers have grown ambivalent, in part due to stubbornly high prices. Pollution and fuel-economy rules face an anachronistic rollback, encouraging automakers to lean into fossil-fueled cars. In the latest indignity, the $7,500 federal clean-car credits, beloved by EV buyers and a wellspring of sales for GM and other automakers, have been choked off by the Trump administration. All that took a $1.6 billion toll on GM’s bottom line this week, in the form of a writedown on third-quarter earnings.

GM directly attributed that $1.6 billion loss to the Trump administration eliminating credits and loosening emissions rules. The dirty ripples from those moves will surely be more polluting internal combustion engine (ICE) cars on the roads, and fewer EVs, as GM and other automakers scale back production to match lowered expectations for consumer demand. For all their sleek new models and multibillion-dollar investments, GM and other automakers continue to lose money on the electric side of the business. And this was before all these new headwinds began to blow.

GM must somehow withstand these industry shake-ups and stresses. But even as it plays defense by shoring up its ICE business, GM plans to keep on the EV offensive. Inside its sprawling Technical Center, the classic midcentury campus designed by Eero Saarinen, GM brings a 21st-century weapon to light: lithium manganese rich batteries, or LMR.

Is LMR the real deal?

Some analysts and investors keep saying Detroit has little chance of competing with China on the global EV stage. GM executives and engineers beg to differ, even as the Trump administration kneecaps the top-down energy and manufacturing policies and government supports that China used to go from automotive also-ran to a dominant force in EVs and batteries.

GM says its affordable, more sustainable LMR batteries will decisively outperform China’s best lithium iron phosphate (LFP) specimens — currently the world’s favored low-cost solution. The company’s new cells should deliver one-third more driving range than LFP, at virtually identical cost. All things equal, that’s the difference between an EV that can cover 300 miles and one that can keep going for 100 miles more. Indeed, GM promises better than 400 miles of EPA-rated range from their largest SUVs and pickups when these batteries arrive in 2028. They’ll also save GM at least $6,000 per battery pack, versus today’s pricey high-nickel cells. That’s nearly enough, by itself, to offset the loss of those $7,500 credits and bring EVs closer toward elusive price parity with gasoline models.

GM plans to keep on the EV offensive

“This unlocks premium long-distance range at an affordable cost,” says Andy Oury, a lead GM battery engineer.

Kurt Kelty, who helped transform the global industry as Tesla’s battery cell development chief, says these cells — unlike solid-state chemistries — aren’t the usual battery clickbait, promising on the page yet perennially stuck in the lab. Talking with more than a dozen battery executives, engineers, researchers, and scientists, their confidence was palpable: These batteries, they say, are tested, proven, and ready for mass production. GM is spending $900 million to build a pair of sprawling new battery centers here, on top of more than $5 billion already invested in US battery operations.

Kelty, GM’s vice president of battery, propulsion, and sustainability, has spent a lifetime in the field. He was at Sony in 1991 when the company debuted its revolutionary Camcorder, the first video recorder with a lithium-ion battery. He spent 11 years guiding Tesla’s battery tech as roughly Employee No. 50 at Elon’s fledgling outfit, then worked on the anode side for Sila Nanotechnologies before coming to GM.

“I’ve kind of seen it all at this point,” Kelty tells me. “So when I say this a game-changer, well, I’ve seen a lot of technologies come and go. Or usually not come. They have an announcement, and then they disappear. That’s kind of the standard for the battery industry.”

Where batteries tend to be about incremental improvement — a superior coating here, a better copper foil there — Kelty says these prismatic LMR cells represent a serious step change. One without the usual tradeoffs.

“That’s why we’re excited about it,” he says. “You can typically get high energy but kill your life cycle, kill your cost, or whatever. But in this case, it’s a really balanced chemistry.”

These batteries could stage an end-run around China in another way, relying more on a US-based supply chain that’s just getting off the ground. Asked about China’s current dominance, Kelty says GM knows what it’s up against. In a bitter irony for American innovation and manufacturing, that Nobel-winning LFP tech was developed right here at the University of Texas. But as American companies dithered, China helped itself to the patented technology and built itself an LFP empire.

“They violated the IP for years and years, but they only sold within China, so it was never an issue,” Kelty says. “Now those patents have expired, so they don’t have any problems exporting [LFP].”

“So you’ve got to keep in mind who your competitors are. And by using LMR, we can now actually exceed their LFP performance, but give it a similar cost.”

A hot ticket in batteries

Oury says LMR has been around for a decade, but researchers couldn’t overcome issues with voltage that petered out over time. Accelerating its development five years ago, starting with coin-size cells, GM solved the durability issues and steadily worked its way up to a larger prismatic form factor — stacks of thin cells, roughly the size of a laptop case — that will go into vehicles.

“We got the confidence to scale up to larger designs,” Oury says.

Among North American automakers, GM placed early bets on building its own “high nickel” or “nickel rich” batteries. That NCM (for nickel-cobalt-manganese) chemistry is the most energy-dense and currently powers nearly every EV sold in America. The automaker initially struggled to build those pouch batteries at scale, bringing production of some EVs to a crawl. But now those bets are paying off, giving GM a potential edge against EV latecomers, including tariff-tossed import brands with no domestic EV or battery factories. GM is now producing more lithium-ion cells than any automaker in North America, in partnership with LG Energy Solution at plants in Ohio and Tennessee.

“So when I say this a game-changer, well, I’ve seen a lot of technologies come and go.”

Kelty says GM can produce those cells at lower cost than any domestic rival. Based in part on teardowns of roughly two dozen competitors’ packs here, Kelty says GM isn’t yet the lowest-cost producer at the pack level — but will reach that milestone with its next-generation EVs. For one, prismatic LMR packs will require 50 percent fewer parts.

High-nickel may be the long-distance champ, but it’s expensive, heavy on pricey nickel and cobalt. Cobalt is also ethically fraught, including sourcing from African mines where children perform hazardous work for meager wages. Those battery costs, roughly 30 percent of a typical vehicle’s cost, remain the number one factor in making EVs unaffordable for many Americans. It’s the reason Cadillac’s impressive Lyriq-V, the 615-horsepower SUV, starts at over $81,000. It’s why a Cadillac Escalade IQ costs $130,000, or a Chevy Silverado EV pickup starts at $75,000.

China’s answer was those LFP batteries, which sparked that nation’s EV revolution, especially for small budget models that dominate that market. Safe and durable, those batteries replaced cobalt and nickel with cheap, plentiful iron and phosphate. GM, Ford, and Stellantis are among Western automakers now looking to build their own LFPs. The tradeoff is mediocre driving range and performance. The newest “Blade” LFP battery from China’s BYD delivers roughly 350 watt-hours per liter of volume. That compares with more than 600 watt-hours for GM’s high-nickel batteries, or Tesla’s 4680 cylindrical cells.

LMR’s innovation finds a middle ground through a healthy dose of manganese, the abundant silver-gray transition metal. The cells sacrifice only modest range versus the most powerful high-nickel designs. But they could be vastly cheaper and whip LFP’s driving range or performance. Ford has announced its own breakthrough in LMR.

In this chemistry competition, the action here is mainly in the cathode. That’s the positive battery electrode that generates electricity for a car or smartphone, and accepts electrons in a chemical reaction as the battery discharges.

Today’s NCM batteries contain up to 85 percent nickel in those cathodes, 10 percent manganese, and 5 percent cobalt. LMR batteries flip that. Their cathodes contain up to 70 percent manganese, about 30 percent nickel, and 2 percent or less of cobalt.

“Manganese is dirt cheap, so at a raw materials level, it gives you that benefit to start with,” says Kushal Narayanaswamy, GM’s director of advanced battery cell engineering.

GM in the house

Cheaper materials are only a start. Analysts say some Chinese companies are bringing new cars or batteries to market in as little as two years. That unrivaled pace may be China’s biggest advantage, more than the technology onboard their EVs. GM says its in-house operations could cut the time it takes to bring new batteries to showrooms by a full year, at lower costs and with higher quality.

I meet Narayanaswamy at the Wallace Battery Cell Innovation Center, a linchpin of GM’s DIY approach to batteries. It’s taking a page from the vertical integration that characterizes China’s BYD, the world’s largest maker of EVs and batteries. Here, GM is developing and testing its own chemistries — mixing black slurries, coating cathodes — without constant back and forth with outside suppliers that can slow projects to a crawl. The Wallace lab can now produce up to 100 cells a day, and has created 26 variants of LMR cells in three form factors. Next door, I see the Ancker-Johnson Battery Cell Development Center under construction. The 500,000-square-foot facility will house a small pilot assembly line for batteries, bridging the often daunting gap between labs and factory production.

The automaker has cut testing time for new batteries by 60 percent. Digital twins and virtual modeling simulate hundreds of real-world scenarios — from condensation in battery packs to catastrophic collisions — before GM builds a single physical cell or pack. The company has simulated more than 1.4 million miles of driving. Radu Theyyunni, global director of virtual electrification and powertrain, says the company’s physics-based models have logged 150 million hours of compute time, to optimize LMR from the atomistic level to full packs. That’s the equivalent of a single, powerful CPU running nonstop for 171 years.

An obvious question: If LMR is all that, why is GM messing around with LFP batteries at all, with plans for production in Tennessee? GM executives argue that LFP can still be the right fit for lower-cost, lower-range models. And LFP shows great potential for second-life uses in stationary energy storage.

Forget the cavalry — it’s up to automakers and consumers

With government credits gone kaput, GM has chosen to pick up those $7,500 tabs itself for now through subsidized lease deals, to keep EV sales from flatlining. That’s generous of GM, but another hit to its bottom line, on top of a tariff bill that could reach $5 billion by year end. Dealers are surely being asked to share the pain.

I ask Kelty if the end of credits is like tearing off the Band-Aid: painful, but ultimately necessary. The credits were never meant to last forever. Now automakers have nowhere to hide, no subsidies, and no excuses. Analysts say the move may separate EV contenders from pretenders. Only automakers who can deliver affordable, compelling EVs, at a profit, will compete or perhaps survive, including against China on the global stage.

“Would I prefer that had come later?” Kelty says of the precipitous end of credits. “Yes, I think we all would. But it forces us to go in the right direction. We’ve got to get our costs down.

“We did this at Tesla as well, to ignore all the incentives out there. You’ve got to be able to stand on your own. And that’s the way we’re looking at it here at GM.”

Kelty says EVs can already match ICE cars in total cost of ownership. But that hasn’t won over enough Americans who look at an EV and see only a higher monthly payment.

“So once you get the sticker price to be similar, then it’s game over for ICE in most applications. Because it’s a better experience when you’re driving an EV.”",https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/10/GMBatteries01-1.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C10.732984293194%2C100%2C78.534031413613&w=1200,N,,2025-10-18 11:02:36.297411

‘Small Louisiana has always been able to punch above our weight and be able to deliver needs to the world and to the nation in ways that other states cannot, so I think it’s important that we think about the fact that we are going to be growing in ways that we never expected before. As we start to develop and grow a little bit more, we need to be focused on how we are going protect our resources and how we can be partners in protecting those resources,” said Davidson.

Davidson, appointed by Gov. Jeff Landry in September 2025, is overseeing a reorganization of the Department of Conservation and Energy aimed at reducing bureaucratic hurdles while also adapting to modern industrial technologies.

“We took the opportunity to eliminate some of the duplicative functions that we had in the department,” he said. “Now we have one permitting office – a permitting office that handles coastal use permits, oil and gas permits, carbon capture permits, and any other permits that we issue. The department now has an enforcement office, ready to enforce the laws on the books, and an Office of Energy that is being expanded to mirror the federal Office of Energy,” said Davidson.

Davidson said the Department of Conservation and Energy, formerly the Department of Energy and Natural Resources, has been “reactive” in the management of oil and gas and water resources for years, in part because of outdated statutes on the books since the early 1900s. Additionally, the department had not been restructured since 1976, Davidson noted.

“We’ve taken the steps as a Department of Conservation and Energy to work closely with Louisiana Economic Development to make sure that any new business they are recruiting to the state is communicated to us, and that we can identify those permits on the front end so that there’s no lag or no delay in delivering those projects to communities – projects like we see in Richland, Louisiana with Meta or like we see with other businesses that will be coming to the state,” said Davidson

“As we look forward to the development of new technologies – and permitting projects around the state – we want make sure that we’re working with the applicants to make sure they know that they need to get out and partner with the community,” Davidson said.

Davidson said the oil and gas industry would benefit from a lower severance tax. “We’ve taken that approach to make sure that we can bring in new developers and help out some of the existing developers that are looking for new plays throughout the state,” he said.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/thecentersquare.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/5/31/531168ba-b335-453b-ab9f-ef8dab017a9f/68dd7abb9528f.image.jpg,N,,2025-10-18 12:11:49.451128

About 30 miles off the coast of Virginia Beach, Virginia, workers have been building America’s largest offshore wind farm at a breakneck pace. The project will start feeding power to the grid by March — the most definitive start date provided by its developer yet.

“First power will occur in Q1 of next year,” Dominion Energy spokesperson Jeremy Slayton told Canary Media. ​“And we are still on schedule to complete by late 2026.”

In an August earnings call, Dominion Energy CEO Robert Blue provided a vague window of ​“early 2026” when asked when the 2.6-gigawatt Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, or CVOW, project would start generating renewable power for the energy-hungry state.

As of the end of September, Dominion had installed all 176 turbine foundations — ​“a big, important milestone,” per Slayton. That accomplishment involved pile-driving 98 foundations into the soft seabed during the five-month stretch when such work is permitted. Good weather helped the work move along quickly, as did the Atlantic Ocean’s unusually quiet hurricane season.

Speed is key when building wind projects under the eye of a president who has called turbines ​​“ugly” and ​​“terrible for tourism” — and who has followed up with attempts to dismantle the industry.

Had CVOW not finished foundation installation by the end of this month, turbine construction would have been delayed until next spring. Federal permitting restricts pile-driving to a May-through-October window to protect migrating North Atlantic right whales. Such a delay would have made CVOW more vulnerable to the wrath of the Trump administration, which has already issued stop-work orders to two offshore wind farms under construction.

But Slayton said the threat of President Donald Trump’s interference doesn’t concern him. CVOW is, after all, 1 of only 2 in-progress offshore wind projects that hasn’t been directly attacked by the president.

“Our project has enjoyed bipartisan support from the beginning,” he said, pointing to backing from some of the state’s leading Republicans, including Governor Glenn Youngkin and U.S. Representative Jen Kiggans.

Kiggans, who represents the politically moderate Virginia Beach area, brought her concerns about Trump’s escalating war on wind to the House floor last month, when Congress returned from recess. She called CVOW ​“important to Virginia,” and House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican from Louisiana, later told reporters that he relayed Kiggans’ message directly to Trump.

“I understand the priority for Virginians and we want to do right by them, so we’ll see,” Johnson told Politico​’s E&E News, in a comment that broke from an anti–offshore wind narrative that’s taken root among many of his fellow House Republicans.

The project is crucial for helping the state meet a deluge of new electricity demand, as Virginia is at the center of the nationwide boom in data-center construction. CVOW will provide a huge amount of carbon-free power to the state and Dominion, its largest utility — helping both keep pace with rising demand without having to burn more polluting fossil fuels.

Kiggans also tied the success of CVOW to the needs of Virginia’s military installations.

“I always speak about that project in light of the national security benefit and that benefit to Naval Air Station Oceana,” Kiggans said last month in an interview with WAVY, a Virginia news station, noting that a partnership with Dominion is ​“giving Naval Air Station Oceana a $500 million power grid upgrade.”

Dominion has already spent $6 billion on the monumental effort to build CVOW, which has been 12 years in the making. Almost $1 billion of that investment has flowed to the local economy, creating 802 full- and part-time jobs in the state’s Hampton Roads region, according to G.T. Hollett, Dominion Energy’s director of offshore wind.

CVOW’s benefits are being felt nationwide too.

“The project has already created 2,000 direct and indirect American jobs and generated $2 billion in economic activity, strengthening the nation’s manufacturing supply chains and our regional economy,” said Katharine Kollins, president of Southeastern Wind Coalition.

Now Dominion will turn to the final phase of construction: turbine installation. The work is made possible by Charybdis — the first U.S.-built, Jones Act–compliant wind-turbine installation vessel — which arrived in Virginia’s Portsmouth Marine Terminal last month.",https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/dominionenergy.jpg?quality=75&strip=all,N,,2025-10-18 12:11:54.365170

China, the world's largest auto market, accounted for roughly two-thirds of global sales, or about 1.3 million vehicles. North America and Europe also posted record highs, according to Rho Motion data manager Charles Lester.

""China remains the dominant driver of global EV growth,"" Lester said, noting that September is typically the country's busiest month for car buying. This year, demand was boosted further by shoppers trying to use up regional trade-in subsidies before they expired.

In the United States, sales jumped as buyers rushed to take advantage of the US$7,500 federal EV tax credit before it ended in late September. Rho Motion said U.S. demand is expected to drop sharply in the final quarter of the year as both consumers and businesses lose access to those incentives, which have been central to recent growth.

Europe also set a new record, thanks to incentives in Germany and solid demand in the United Kingdom. Tesla's rollout of a lower-cost Model Y in Europe is expected to intensify competition in the coming months.

During an interview for the Plugged-In Podcast, airing Friday, I asked GM President Mark Reuss about the ""family of Bolts"" he mentioned on stage at an investor event about a year ago. What can we expect those to be like?

“What comes after this, whether it’s called a Bolt or not, will be a family of things that is low priced,” he said. “And when I say family, they won’t be adopted. They’ll be in the same vein of size and price.”

So, the family members won't all be Bolts, but they will share its general price point and size. That is, they'll be compact electric vehicles that cost around $30,000. The launch-edition Bolt goes on sale for $29,990 early next year, and Reuss said the upcoming models would be ""around that price point, so plus or minus.""

The big question, then, is what kinds of EVs to expect. Understandably, GM is playing it close to the chest, as none of these vehicles have been officially announced. But Reuss did say broadly that they could slot into ""white spaces"" in the EV market.

“I also think there’s some white spaces in size, class, of forms—not only the Bolt that we just introduced but also some different things, for different people’s styled tastes,"" he said.

There's one glaring ""white space"" to me, and that's the compact electric pickup segment. Ford has seen great success with the Maverick, but there's no electric equivalent to that yet. Ford is working on a roughly $30,000 electric pickup, and Slate is getting ready to launch one in the mid-$20,000 ballpark.

It wouldn't be at all surprising if GM was considering the same thing, especially because hulking, expensive, big-battery trucks like the Silverado EV haven't exactly taken off in the marketplace. Plus, we know the automaker has at least toyed with the idea in its affordable EV design studio.

Otherwise, I'd bank on another Bolt-sized compact crossover. Chevy said the 2027 Bolt will be ""limited run,"" and GM will likely want another small SUV to fill in its place in the EV lineup below the roughly $36,000 Equinox EV. A small sedan or hatchback seems unlikely, since GM has largely exited that segment.

Earlier this year, GM said a mysterious ""next-gen affordable EV"" will be built at its Fairfax Assembly Plant in Kansas City, where the Bolt is produced.

The new Bolt is a partially redesigned take on the latest version, packing a new 65 kWh lithium-iron-phosphate battery pack, better charging and a new motor into the same general package. Reuss suggested that the cheaper ""family"" will use different underlying technology from GM EVs that came before. That could mean a wider adoption of LFP batteries, or something different like the lithium-manganese-rich (LMR) cells it's working on to cut costs.

Ford, for its part, has developed a ground-up platform and manufacturing system designed to make its next-generation EVs cheaper to build. GM is trying to drive down production costs, too.

This deployment uses the natural gas network run by Energy Transfer to ensure a steady, reliable supply for Oracle’s expanding cloud infrastructure.

Nathan Ough, Chief Executive Officer of VoltaGrid, calls it more than a standard power agreement.

He says: “This is more than a power deal, it’s a collaboration with Oracle to engineer scalable solutions that dampen swings in AI power demand.”

Nathan adds that their platform offers ""grid-grade performance with ultra-fast response, zero reliance on battery storage and near-zero criteria air emissions"".

The infrastructure rests on VoltaGrid’s modular power system, developed in collaboration with industrial technology firms INNIO Jenbacher and ABB.

The system meets the highly variable power requirements of AI workloads while reducing the need for battery-based backup.

The design enables fast response to changing loads, aligning reliability with environmental standards.

Matching AI's power volatility with scalable solutions

AI data centres face uneven energy demand.

As AI models grow in size and complexity, the power load shifts depending on the computational tasks at hand.

These fluctuations present a challenge for infrastructure providers, who must deliver constant power despite the inconsistent nature of the workloads.

Mahesh Thiagarajan, Executive Vice President of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, explains: “AI workloads are uniquely power-intensive and highly variable, often creating swings in demand.”

He says the collaboration with VoltaGrid helps Oracle to create “innovations that dampen these swings, making AI’s power usage more stable, predictable and grid-friendly”.

Oracle aims to support its AI infrastructure with dependable power that scales up or down without delay.

VoltaGrid’s platform becomes part of OCI’s wider energy strategy, offering on-demand delivery that aligns with both performance goals and emissions compliance.

The system also reduces strain on local grids, freeing Oracle from full reliance on public infrastructure.

The modular design provides high-quality output with fast deployment and supports improved heat rejection, a critical factor in high-density computing environments.

Natural gas backbone and firm power delivery

The infrastructure receives fuel from Energy Transfer, a key US energy supplier with an extensive pipeline and storage network.

This access to firm natural gas supply allows VoltaGrid to maintain operational consistency, a necessity for enterprise-scale data centres dealing with complex AI workloads.

VoltaGrid’s use of hybrid power, balancing gas efficiency with environmental goals, fits into Oracle’s strategy of resilience through energy diversification.

The system avoids the volatility of pure renewables while keeping emissions low.

This approach reflects wider trends in data centre energy strategy.

As power needs rise, especially with growth in high-performance computing and AI, cloud providers look for energy models that guarantee uptime.

VoltaGrid’s offering supports those aims without pulling heavily from local grids.

The partnership sets up Oracle to maintain availability and performance across regions that face surging demand for electricity.

Earlier this year, amid much fanfare, the world’s largest maritime nations agreed on the regulations, which would impose a fee on carbon pollution to clean up shipping. The next step of the process — adopting the regulations — during the International Maritime Organization meeting in London this week was widely expected to be a formality.

Instead, after much pressure from Trump, along with Saudi Arabia and a handful of other countries, delegates decided to postpone the decision by a year and adjourn. In the interim, nations will continue to negotiate and work toward consensus.

The development underscored how the influence of Trump, who recently called climate change a “con job,” extends globally to policies aimed at combating climate change.

“Faced with pressure, too many governments chose political compromise over climate justice, and in doing so, abandoned the countries bearing the brunt of the climate crisis,” said Emma Fenton, senior director for climate diplomacy at a U.K.-based climate change nonprofit, Opportunity Green.

The Trump administration was quick to celebrate

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio hailed the development as “another huge win” for Trump.

“Thanks to his leadership, the United States prevented a massive U.N. tax hike on American consumers that would have funded progressive climate pet projects,” Rubio wrote on X. “Our country will continue to lead the way and put America FIRST.”

Trump had urged countries to vote “No,” posting on his social media platform Truth Social on Thursday that “the United States will not stand for this global green new scam tax on shipping.” The U.S. had threatened to retaliate with tariffs, visa restrictions and port levies if nations supported it.

After vowing to fight any global tax on shipping emissions, Saudi Arabia called for a vote to adjourn the meeting for a year. More than half the countries agreed.

Arsenio Dominguez, secretary-general of the IMO, the United Nations agency that regulates international shipping, said in a post-meeting news conference that “geopolitics in the world right now makes it more difficult for us to make progress in certain topics.”

Nations falter in their efforts to save the planet

The decision, or lack thereof, in London is similar to what happened this summer with a major treaty to end growing plastic pollution around the world. The negotiations fell apart, with the United States and Saudi Arabia opposing any limit on plastic production.

The world’s biggest climate summit, COP30, is in November in Belem, Brazil. Ralph Regenvanu, minister for climate change for the Pacific Island nation of Vanuatu, said the road to Belem and beyond is now more difficult.

“The IMO’s failure to adopt the framework this week marks a failure of this United Nations agency to act decisively on climate change,” Regenvanu said. “But we know that we have international law on our side and will continue to fight for our people and the planet.”

Shipping emissions grow

Large ships last about 25 years, so the industry would need to make changes and investments now to slash its emissions. Most ships today run on heavy fuel oil that releases carbon dioxide and other pollutants as it’s burned. The International Chamber of Shipping, which represents over 80% of the world’s merchant fleet, advocated for the adoption of the regulations.

Thomas Kazakos, the chamber’s secretary-general, said they are disappointed because the industry needs clarity to be able to make the investments needed to decarbonize the maritime sector.

Shipping emissions have grown over the past decade to about 3% of the global total as trade has grown and vessels use immense amounts of fossil fuels to transport cargo over long distances.

The regulations, or “Net-Zero Framework,” would set a marine fuel standard that decreases, over time, the amount of greenhouse gas emissions allowed from using shipping fuels. The regulations also would establish a pricing system that would impose fees for every ton of greenhouse gases emitted by ships above allowable limits, in what is effectively the first global tax on greenhouse gas emissions.

“The delay leaves the shipping sector drifting in uncertainty. But this week has also shown that there is a clear desire to clean up the shipping industry, even in the face of U.S. bullying,” said Alison Shaw, IMO Manager at Transport & Environment, a Brussels-based environmental nongovernmental organization.

The IMO set a target for the sector to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by about 2050, and has committed to ensuring that fuels with zero or near-zero emissions are used more widely.

“What matters now is that countries rise up and come back to the IMO with a louder and more confident yes vote that cannot be silenced,” said Anaïs Rios, shipping policy officer for Seas At Risk. “The planet and the future of shipping does not have time to waste.”",https://www.wishtv.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/18/US-blocks-a-global-fee-on-shipping-emissions-as-international-meeting-ends-without-new-regulations-scaled-e1760746838654.jpg,N,,2025-10-18 15:02:35.813440

(DTN) -- U.S. soybean farmers could lose between $3.2 billion and $7.5 billion if the Trump administration does not completely reallocate biofuels gallons to small-refinery exemptions to the Renewable Fuel Standard, a biofuels group told Lee Zeldin, administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, in an Oct. 16, 2025, letter.

Clean Fuels Alliance America cited an analysis by World Agricultural Economic and Environmental Services, that outlines the losses to soybean farmers based on how much volume from SREs is reallocated.

The EPA issued a supplemental proposal to the RFS volumes, asking for public input on a range of reallocation from zero to 100%.

According to the company's study, if the agency adopts a 50% reallocation in 2026 to 2027 490 million gallons of biomass-based diesel production would be lost, leading to $1.4 billion in lost soybean farm revenue and a $1.8 billion drop in the value of soybean products to soybean crushers.

Clean Fuels said in the letter to Zeldin that reallocating zero gallons of biofuels would be ""considerable worse.""

The analysis found it would lead to 1 billion gallons of lost biomass-based diesel production, $2.6 billion in lost soybean revenue to farms and a $4.9 billion drop in the value of soybean products to crushers.

""Biomass-based diesel is essential to America's farm security, now more than ever,"" Clean Fuels said in the letter.

""Domestic biodiesel, renewable diesel and SAF (sustainable aviation fuel) production supports 10% of the value of every bushel of soybeans grown in the United States. With increased farm productivity, U.S. soybean growers are right now harvesting a projected 4.3 billion bushels of soybeans for the season worth $43 billion. And with more than $6 billion of investment, U.S. soybean processors are expected to crush a record 2.5 billion of those bushels next year.""

Clean Fuels said that in facing retaliatory trade measures from China and a growing global competition from Argentina and Brazil, ""America's farmers cannot afford to lose the value"" that U.S. biomass-based diesel brings.

""We acknowledge that the current government shutdown is impacting both the administration's ability to provide economic relief to America's farmers and EPA's goal of meeting the statutory deadlines for the RFS rule,"" the group told Zeldin.

""Nevertheless, America's farmers are facing extreme economic challenge

and making planting decisions for next season. Biomass-based diesel producers and soybean processors are already negotiating feedstock contracts, fuel production and offtake agreements, and investment decisions for 2026. Across the board, our industry needs the rulemaking to be published before the end of the year to provide necessary policy stability and market confidence.""

Kurt Kovarik, Clean Fuels' vice president of federal affairs, said in a statement, ""Clean Fuels urges EPA to quickly finalize the robust, timely RFS volumes it proposed in June and ensure they are not eroded by small-refinery exemptions. U.S. biodiesel and renewable diesel production supports 10% of the value of every bushel of soybeans grown here. Supporting continued growth of U.S. biomass-based diesel is crucial right now to support American farmers and the agricultural economy.""

“You don’t have to love climate policy to love cheaper energy and American jobs.
For communities pursuing ambitious climate goals, the lesson is clear: engage people where they are, identify shared priorities, and focus on solutions that deliver economic and lifestyle benefits.","Heather Reams, the president of Citizens for Responsible Energy Solutions (CRES), stepped onto the stage at Breckenridge’s Mountain Towns 2030 summit — a room full of progressives accustomed to negotiating with Republicans on climate policy. She faced an audience from Idaho, Wyoming, Utah and Colorado — areas that often depend on Republican-controlled legislatures to achieve local sustainability goals.

Reams suggested that the instinct of these communities shouldn’t be to lecture or shame. It should be to listen and find common ground. “Democrats can’t do it alone,” she said. “Republicans care deeply about their land. They hunt, they fish, they ski. They love the outdoors as much as anyone. So, of course, they care about clean air and water. The question is: How do we talk about it?”

A lifelong Republican, Reams has made it her mission to answer that question. CRES collaborates with GOP lawmakers to promote clean energy, arguing that the conservative case for renewables is grounded in innovation, competitiveness and energy independence — not ideology.

At the conference, she stressed that the key to climate progress isn’t confrontation, but compromise. One side might favor solar projects while the other insists on traditional fuel sources. By recognizing shared interests — for example, expanding solar energy while permitting additional natural gas pipelines or transmission lines — both sides can advance without ideological conflict. It’s not about surrender; it’s practical problem-solving.

Reams highlighted Sen. John Curtis of Utah, founder of the Conservative Climate Caucus, as a conservative champion of the environment. He has argued that the GOP should help shape, not resist, climate policy, emphasizing that sound stewardship and strong markets go hand in hand. Not all conservatives are on board. Reams wryly notes Utah’s other senator, Mike Lee, who, as she puts it, “just pats me on the head” when renewables come up.

Polls suggest that finding common ground reflects more than strategy— it meets voter demand. Pew Research Center data from 2024 show that 72 percent of Americans — including 56% of Republicans under 40 — support expanding solar and wind energy. A Yale Climate Communications poll reinforces this enthusiasm, showing that clean energy incentives can generate local jobs and economic growth.

Beyond politics, Reams emphasized the economic benefits of renewables. Solar, wind, battery storage, advanced nuclear, and geothermal are increasingly cost-competitive. Emerging energy industries can create high-paying local jobs, keeping residents in their hometowns rather than forcing talent to cities. She believes free-market forces are increasingly backing the case for clean energy.

That resonates with Republican leaders, who tend to prioritize economic and local issues and often find that sustained dialogue is more effective than public confrontation. “Renewables are winning on price,” Reams said. “You don’t have to love climate policy to love cheaper energy and American jobs. We can win this on free-market principles.”

Geography and lifestyle naturally align. Western Republicans often share goals with progressives for preserving air, water and open space — and honoring the outdoorsy lifestyle. Coastal communities have similar motivations, whether it’s a clean Chesapeake Bay or a healthy Tampa Bay. For Americans who hunt, ski or hike, the outdoors can be a shared starting point — even across party lines.

For communities pursuing ambitious climate goals, the lesson is clear: engage people where they are, identify shared priorities, and focus on solutions that deliver economic and lifestyle benefits. Extreme views will always exist, but the broad middle can drive policy forward. Pragmatic collaboration, not ideological purity, is the path to progress.

By turning shared values into practical policies — whether through permitting reform or renewable energy initiatives — communities can make net-zero goals achievable. The enemy isn’t political disagreement; it’s obstinacy. When both sides operate from common interests, compromise becomes not just possible but also the most effective way forward.

As the push for renewable energy grows stronger, the state faces tough questions about how to transition away from its reliance on coal – an energy source deeply embedded in both the economy and culture. WFHB Environmental Correspondent Amelia Bucher explores the challenges, the stakes and the politics of Indiana’s energy future in her feature on the path to cleaner, more sustainable power.

And now for your environmental reports:

Indiana is doing its part to bring forests back to life:

The Nature Conservancy has been restoring Green’s Bluff, a natural area in Owen County threatened by development, and just this month, they secured an additional 83 acres. This means forest protection for the Raccoon Creek area of the forest and more habitats preserved for migrating songbirds. Many plants and animals need large, connected forests to survive. Once a fragmented woodlands, more than 68,000 trees now grow at Greens Bluff, including hardwood species like red oak, white oak, and walnut trees. Beyond planting, the Nature Conservancy has also added trails and created pollinator habitat at the preserve, and continues to pursue additional acreage to further consolidate forest protection at the site. Located about 15 minutes outside Bloomington, visitors can enjoy a trip to Greens Bluff Nature Preserve for a hike, to go birding, or to simply enjoy the changing colors of fall.

Coral reef decline: Scientists say coral reefs have become the first major environmental system on Earth to pass a climate tipping point—a threshold where damage to the planet becomes self-perpetuating and potentially irreversible. This report from the University of Exeter’s Global Systems Institute reveals that coral reefs have crossed the boundary where warming causes widespread, cascading collapse.

Warming oceans trigger bleaching events, where heat stress causes coral to expel the colorful algae that sustains it. If the stress continues, the coral dies completely. The International Coral Reef Initiative reported in April that an estimated 84 percent of the world’s coral reefs were under heat stress—the most extensive and intense mass bleaching event ever recorded. Coral reefs support about a quarter of all marine life and provide livelihoods for roughly a billion people worldwide.

Current global temperatures, about 1.4 degrees Celsius above preindustrial averages, are now just a fractions of a degree away from the worst-case scenario in which the coral simply cannot survive. However, there is still opportunity to slow these trends. Experts emphasize that slowing global warming by rapidly transitioning away from fossil fuels and shifting towards renewable energy is now essential to preserve remaining coral populations and prevent additional ecosystem collapses.

Here is more information on coral reefs. The planet just crossed its first climate tipping point. Coral reefs are now in irreversible decline due to ocean warming and acidification caused by climate change.

Without rapid climate action, experts warn that we’re on the brink of hitting other tipping points too, including the devastation of the Amazon rainforest, the collapse of vital ocean currents, and the loss of ice sheets.

The unfortunate fact is, world leaders are failing to act fast enough to avoid climate catastrophe. And some, including Donald Trump, are more focused on attacking climate science and ripping up all our climate progress to date.

That’s why COP30 — the world’s biggest climate talks — is an opportunity we can’t afford to miss. In less than a month, decision-makers will meet in Belém, Brazil, to shape the course of climate action for years to come. 350.org and our partners are demanding COP30 deliver:

A rapid phaseout of fossil fuels, with no new oil, gas, or coal projects.

Reparations from wealthy countries to communities on the frontlines of climate loss and damage.

Indigenous, traditional, and frontline leadership at COP.

This year’s COP couldn’t be held in a more significant place. Belém is known as the gateway to the Amazon — and climate change and deforestation are pushing the Amazon ecosystem to the point of no return.

Now that we’ve passed the first tipping point — the collapse of coral reefs — we’re hurtling toward the next: the dieback of the Amazon, which is a critical carbon sink and will do devastating harm to the 100 million people who depend on the forest. We can’t let that happen.

In a remarkable triumph for marine conservation, green sea turtles have been removed from the endangered species list!

The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) announced the reclassification to “least concern” status last week, marking one of the most significant marine species recoveries in recent decades.

Green sea turtles had been hunted to near-extinction for their meat, eggs, and shells. But in the 1970s, the U.S. Endangered Species Act and the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species banned commercial harvest and international trade of these animals. While these policies have vastly improved the population decline, sea turtles remain threatened by human presence: Accidents and injuries by boats and fishing and illness due to ocean pollution, especially plastics. But action has been taken to protect and restore green turtle populations. Around the world, individuals and organizations have driven local beach protection efforts, international collaboration between countries, and fishery innovations like turtle-friendly nets.

Florida has led much of the protection efforts in the U.S. through organizations like the Sea Turtle Conservancy which works to protect and improve sea turtle nesting grounds, and the Turtle Hospital which specializes rescue, rehabilitation, and release of sea turtles. Efforts like these along coasts worldwide have brought the green turtle population back to a level that no longer presents as “endangered.” The green turtle’s comeback offers proof that international cooperation and persistent effort can reverse biodiversity loss and restore hope for other endangered species.

Our friends at Wild Birds Unlimited share with us on how to prevent window strikes and help save the song birds.

Here’s a harsh truth: colliding with windows can be fatal for birds. Even if they manage to fly away, they are not just “stunned,” birds are often seriously injured. Windows reflecting sky or greenery trick birds into thinking there’s a clear flight path, and juvenile birds (who are just figuring things out) are especially at risk.

Preventing window strikes is one way you can help Save the Song Birds. With a few thoughtful adjustments, you can help birds recognize your windows as barriers, not passageways.

Feeder Placement: Place bird feeding stations within three feet of the window or beyond ten feet. Within three feet, birds fleeing the feeder area will not have built up enough speed to injure themselves if they strike the window. Beyond ten feet, birds will have enough time to spot and avoid the window.

Visual Cues: Apply deterrents to your windows (such as screens or decals) to help birds see the barrier and give them a chance to take action before any harm is done.

Install a Window Feeder: Use a window feeder to make birds more aware of the glass and so you have a front-row seat to watch your feathered visitors.

One year after removing the last dam on the Klamath River in California and Oregon, ecosystems are improving!

You may recall one of our September EcoReports cited the Klamath River dam removal as one example of Indigenous communities guiding environmental practices. Well since the removal of the dam last year, scientists can now confirm that these waters and their fish populations, are returning to original numbers, exceeding expectations.

For over a century, dams on the Klamath River created reservoirs that acted as “heat batteries,” allowing water to absorb and retain excessive summer warmth, triggering harmful algal blooms that produce the toxin microcystin. Since removing the last dam from the Klamath River, water samples that previously showed 58% contamination with microcystin now show zero detectable levels in 82% of samples.

According to the Yurok Tribal Fisheries Department Director Barry McCovey Jr., “the progress that we’ve made in just one year is pretty incredible. It provides us with a lot of hope for the future.”

Local tribal fishermen report that fish are returning earlier and in larger, healthier sizes than they have in over a century. The progress demonstrates the power of removing barriers to ecological recovery and offers hope for restoring other damaged river systems.

The accelerating energy demand is a growing concern for Americans.
There is no denying that renewable energy is supporting our economy and local workforce.
As the founder of Ideal Energy, a veteran-owned and operated solar and storage company, I am also proud that the renewable energy industry hires veterans at a faster rate than other industries.
As energy demands continue to rise and the country seeks long-term solutions, Iowa can be the example.","Iowa, a place over three million Americans call home, is also home to some of the nation's first achievements. We're the first in the country to caucus for president, the first to lead the nation in corn production, and the first to generate more than 60% of our electricity from renewable energy.

When it comes to setting an example, Iowa leads the way, and now is our moment to do it again.

The accelerating energy demand is a growing concern for Americans. With Iowa's electricity needs expected to increase by 30-60 percent over the next 20 years, it's time for Iowa to set an example for how we will stay ahead of the demand.

There is no denying that renewable energy is supporting our economy and local workforce. In Iowa alone, the industry employs nearly 15,000 workers, keeping them in their communities.

By being home to the first college in the nation to offer a Wind Energy and Turbine Technology associate's degree – utilizing a turbine as a working laboratory – young Iowans can effectively transition from the classroom into well-paying jobs in a place they already call home.

As the founder of Ideal Energy, a veteran-owned and operated solar and storage company, I am also proud that the renewable energy industry hires veterans at a faster rate than other industries.

With 16-plus years of experience serving our communities in clean energy, and 12 years of service to our country overseas as both a U.S. Navy SEAL and independent contractor under the Department of State, I recognize that renewable energy is the cleanest and most efficient form of homegrown energy, which keeps us from relying on foreign adversaries for our energy needs.

It is our mission to educate Iowans about localized energy solutions that allow us to flourish independently and empower our communities.

Iowa farmers should feel emboldened to harvest the sun and participate in cashing in on Iowa's most valuable land uses. According to the USDA NASS Data, the production value of solar is estimated at $11,068 per acre. That's ten times more than any other viable crop in the state. This income could be a lifeline for Iowa's generational farmers.

It is also important to note that these utility-scale solar and wind leases are completely voluntary between the landowner and the developer and will never require the use of eminent domain. Just another reason why protecting property rights also means protecting a farmer's right to choose what they harvest on their land.

Iowa is a state that leads, not follows. As energy demands continue to rise and the country seeks long-term solutions, Iowa can be the example.

We are not only powering our own communities with renewable energy, but we are empowering an entire nation to follow our lead as we light the way to an independent and secure energy future.

Illinois manufacturers rely on uninterrupted power to operate safely and efficiently.
It is possible to advance our environmental goals while keeping Illinois affordable, competitive, and reliable.
Illinois manufacturers are ready to help build a brighter energy future.
Mark Denzler is the president & CEO of the Illinois Manufacturers’ Association.","Illinois manufacturers are the backbone of our state’s economy—employing more than 600,000 workers, supporting local communities, and producing the goods that power America. But none of that is possible without access to affordable, reliable, and resilient energy.

Over the last several weeks, the Illinois House and Senate have held additional hearings to address the state’s rising power demands, with the goal of advancing legislation during the fall veto session in October. Unfortunately, this renewed push for a sweeping energy bill does little to address flaws in a similar proposal unveiled during the spring, with major new costs that could soon hit the manufacturing sector and every Illinois family. While it’s true that Illinois must modernize its energy framework, this latest proposal misses the mark by prioritizing costly mandates over meaningful investment in the resources we truly need: increased generation and more robust transmission.

The manufacturing sector is one of the largest consumers of energy in Illinois. Without affordable and predictable rates, manufacturers cannot plan for growth, make long-term investments, or stay competitive in a global economy. The current proposal jeopardizes that stability.

While provisions such as investing in battery storage are useful, the current proposal is a multi-billion dollar plan that will add a brand-new cost on every single energy bill. The proposal falls short of sufficiently addressing the need for more power generation, particularly dispatchable baseload generation that keeps the lights on when the sun isn’t shining and the wind isn’t blowing. Illinois manufacturers rely on uninterrupted power to operate safely and efficiently. Yet we’re seeing growing concerns about grid reliability throughout Illinois following repeated warnings issued by the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) about potential capacity shortfalls.

The impact of these warnings is not theoretical, with customers in downstate Illinois now feeling the strain of an estimated 20 percent increase in their electric bills. Looking north, the story is all too similar. Households in the service territory belonging to PJM, which serves Chicago and much of Northern Illinois, have already seen a $67.28 month-over-month increase to the average June 30 bill. What’s more, the capacity cost for electricity throughout PJM’s territory will climb another 22 percent beginning in June 2026 in accordance with the grid operator’s latest auction. These shortfalls and resulting price increases represent real risks to industrial operations, community investment, and economic development. Without a serious effort to both extend our current energy plants and increase generation capacity, we’re courting disaster.

Likewise, Illinois must invest in transmission infrastructure to deliver energy where and when it’s needed. Manufacturing isn’t confined to urban centers—it’s spread across the state, in both large cities and small towns. Without adequate transmission, adding new renewable or storage assets won’t help manufacturers if they can’t access that power. In addition to expanding generation, the focus of our state’s energy policy must center on developing a meaningful plan to streamline transmission development or address permitting bottlenecks.

Manufacturers are not opposed to clean energy. In fact, we’ve led the way on efficiency and emissions reduction. But any policy must be grounded in reality and avoid high-cost mandates that are missing well-defined guardrails, especially at a time when businesses and households can least afford these added burdens. It is possible to advance our environmental goals while keeping Illinois affordable, competitive, and reliable.

As lawmakers return to Springfield, they have a chance to reset and refocus and avoid the mistakes of the past.

Illinois manufacturers are ready to help build a brighter energy future. That means going back to the table, listening to stakeholders, and drafting policy that focuses on what really matters: reliable generation, strong transmission, and affordable rates.

While catalyzing the economy, the Sparrows Point project simultaneously strengthens our national security.
With or without federal support, USW members will do what we always do.","The U.S. Department of Transportation showed an alarming disregard for the nation’s security a few weeks ago by clawing back a $47.3 million grant intended to launch a new era of steel production at Sparrows Point.

Members of our union, the United Steelworkers (USW), are profoundly disappointed by the Trump administration’s abandonment of a project primed to create jobs, boost manufacturing capacity and meet our country’s growing energy needs.

But it’s important to emphasize that the government’s turnabout represents only a setback, not the end of this forward-looking initiative.

The USW and our partner, US Wind, remain committed to bringing steel back to Baltimore and injecting new life into Sparrows Point. We’re confident that this site, once the home of the largest steel mill in the world, has yet another pivotal role to play in America’s future.

The USW and US Wind joined forces about four years ago. We intend to use a portion of the mill property to build monopiles — the huge foundations sunk into the seabed to support wind turbines — through a new company called Sparrows Point Steel.

Over the full scope of US Wind’s offshore projects, the company will consume more than 330,000 metric tons of steel plate, a huge boon to the steel industry. This is directly in line with the Trump administration’s stated goal of building more in America — and makes the administration’s cancellation of the grant all the more puzzling.

Current projections call for Sparrows Point Steel to employ more than 500 USW members in production, maintenance and a variety of other roles. We’re talking about good-paying, middle-class jobs that enable workers to support their families and lift up the entire community.

Our commitment to building out the wind energy supply chain means sourcing not only our steel plate but many other kinds of materials and supplies from domestic producers. In all, workers from nearly 50 companies across Maryland will benefit from vendor relationships with Sparrows Point Steel.

On top of that, US Wind intends to establish an operations and maintenance center at the harbor in West Ocean City. This facility will coordinate turbine and substation maintenance for offshore wind developments, creating still more jobs in the manufacturing, maritime and energy sectors.

But there’s more. While catalyzing the economy, the Sparrows Point project simultaneously strengthens our national security.

Our work will help to position America as the leader in a global, evolving industry. It will also help to deliver a more reliable energy supply at a time of growing demand and more frequent disruptions in the power grid resulting from climate change.

Marylanders get this.

A recent poll found that seven out of 10 respondents support the construction of wind projects off the Maryland coast because of their potential to stabilize energy prices, enhance the nation’s energy supply and reduce pollution.

The respondents’ support cut across political lines, underscoring the high stakes. What’s more, 81% opposed the reversal of offshore wind projects already underway out of concern for job losses, according to the survey, conducted by Turn Forward, a nonprofit supporting wind energy.

Sparrows Point is hallowed ground for the USW.

At one time, tens of thousands of union members worked here, producing the steel that built the middle class, fueled prosperity and made America a superpower.

We now have an opportunity to build on that legacy — to harness manufacturing and energy for a stronger future.

With or without federal support, USW members will do what we always do. Alongside our partners at US Wind, we’ll get the job done.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/20210803_104844-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-18 06:59:48.917937

Bill Cassidy on Thursday offered a full-throated defense of President Donald Trump’s energy policies, saying the administration seeks to foster the development of new clean energy technologies without forcing taxpayers to subsidize industries that aren’t ready to stand on their own.

Cassidy, a Republican facing a tough reelection battle next year, said Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act, passed by Congress in July, puts sensible limits on clean energy subsidies while supporting advances in carbon capture and storage, high-tech fuels and other energy innovation.

“The Biden administration created overly generous subsidies for industries that would lower the carbon footprint,” Cassidy said in an interview in New Orleans during a break at the Louisiana Energy Security Summit. “President Trump and the Republican Congress said this can't just be a money grab for industry. It has to be something that gets you on your feet, and then you become commercially viable.”

He added that the president’s efforts to reopen shuttered nuclear power plants also will create more carbon-free energy to fuel domestic demand driven by the advent of power-hungry AI data centers.

Thursday's energy summit was hosted by the American Council for Capital Formation, a pro-business think tank that advocates for free market policies.

More than 250 energy industry executives gathered for presentations and networking at the Higgins Hotel in the Warehouse District. Cassidy provided opening and closing remarks, bookending presentations about China’s threat to America’s energy production and supply chain, manufacturing momentum in Louisiana, and how the state’s oil and gas industry strengthens U.S. leadership.

Cassidy's comments defending Trump come three months after passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act enshrined into law dramatic changes to the nation's energy policy, which emphasizes increased domestic oil and gas production at the expense of cleaner and renewable energy sources.

Trump's bill slashed Biden-era tax breaks designed to boost wind and solar power, threatening billions in investments in Louisiana and, critics have said, slowing the state's efforts to grow its clean energy industry at a time when greenhouse gas emissions are contributing to climate change.

Currently, Louisiana has more than a dozen utility-scale solar farms. Though there aren't any land-based wind farms in the state yet, at least five utility-scale wind projects are in development..

The administration has kept in place some tax breaks for hydrogen, battery storage and nuclear plants protects.

Evolving energy industry

Cassidy is gearing up for a 2026 U.S. Senate race that has attracted several competitors who believe the state's senior senator is vulnerable because of his 2021 vote to convict Trump during a second impeachment trial. The race will be Louisiana's first closed primary in decades.

Among Cassidy's challengers are state Treasurer John Fleming, state Sen. Blake Miguez of Lafayette, Public Service Commissioner Eric Skrmetta and St. Tammany Parish Councilwoman Kathy Seiden. All are highlighting their devotion to Trump.

During the interview, Cassidy said Louisiana needs more jobs, better protection from extreme weather, cheaper insurance and better schools to keep up with neighboring Southern states.

“The bayou regions have lost population because, after Ida, the cost of housing went up, families felt insecure and they moved out, so we've got to make our state more secure from things like hurricanes and flooding,” Cassidy said, citing the 18.5-mile, nearly $4 billion hurricane protection system that will stretch from the Bonnet Carre Spillway to Garyville as an important step in the right direction.

Cassidy also highlighted a bill he co-sponsored by Sen. Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina, that he said would help build domestic energy production of all types. The latest version of the bill, introduced in April, would place a fee on high-pollution imports from international competitors. It is under review by a Senate committee.

Third, fiscal optics: A loan guarantee—the Loan Programs Office has averaged about a 3 percent loss rate historically—is easier to justify favorably than is a direct grant, especially in cases where upgrades have no new routes or eminent domain.
Still, customers are experiencing the sting from congestion charges and reliability must-run costs when the grid is tight.","The Department of Energy will proceed with a $1.6 billion loan guarantee for an approximately 5,000-mile-long high-voltage transmission line modernization project owned by American Electric Power, representing one of the few times where the current administration upheld an initiative begun during Mr. Biden’s tenure. The package emphasizes building on existing rights-of-way in Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma and West Virginia to increase capacity and relieve congestion without cutting through new swaths of land.

The financing was in its closing stages toward the end of the previous administration and had been under review as part of a broader re-evaluation of energy grants and loans. If allowed to go forward, it sends a pragmatic carve-out message: projects that provide close-at-hand reliability benefits and involve largely low-conflict upgrades that can move faster seem to be okayed.

AEP, one of the nation’s largest transmission owners, believes the effort involves about 13% of its network. The loan guarantee, issued by DOE’s Loan Programs Office (renamed in the Trump era as Energy Dominance Financing Program), lets the utility access lower-cost financing. DOE officials say the more favorable terms will save the company a minimum of $275 million, with ratepayers due for some benefit.

A Loan Guarantee With Swift Grid Impact and Savings

Reconductoring is a quick and cost-effective method to add throughput on the existing towers by swapping out the old wires for new conductors—advanced versions like high-temperature, low-sag designs that can safely move more electricity along the same corridor. It sidesteps the protracted siting battles and environmental reviews that come with new lines, which is a significant advantage in places where public opposition or permitting delays can slow projects for years.

Industry analyses underscore the payoff. The Brattle Group and other grid consultants have found that technologies like reconductoring and its cousin grid-enhancing tech can, in many cases, boost the transfer capacity of expensive lines by double digits, as well as deliver benefits in months or years instead of a decade after they are first installed. Though this AEP package focuses on new wires, similar projects that add so-called dynamic line rating devices—sensors that change the capacity in real time by considering weather—have delivered considerable congestion relief at a low cost.

The stakes are high. Transmission congestion costs across organized markets—now totaling less than $20 billion in recent years—are leading to higher customer bills, and low-cost wind and solar have been curtailed. AEP’s footprint lies at the borders of the PJM, MISO, and SPP markets where you’re especially likely to see transmission constraints manifested through differences in wholesale price spreads.

Why This Program Withstood Administration Scrutiny

The administration has sought to roll back a number of transition-period awards, such as one totaling $467 million in Minnesota aimed at unlocking 28 gigawatts of new generation—predominantly wind and solar—and $250 million in Oregon to connect a slate of renewable projects. It has also singled out a $630 million grant in California’s grid modernization bid to build that state’s grid with advanced conductors and dynamic line ratings, both designed to pull more capacity from existing energy corridors.

So why spare the AEP loan? Three reasons stand out. First, reliability: the North American Electric Reliability Corporation has issued multiple alerts of high risks on the Midwest-Plains grid under peak conditions. Second is customer economics: the guarantee is meant to pass savings on to bills by cutting borrowing costs. Third, fiscal optics: A loan guarantee—the Loan Programs Office has averaged about a 3 percent loss rate historically—is easier to justify favorably than is a direct grant, especially in cases where upgrades have no new routes or eminent domain.

The political math, too, is stacked in favor of incremental victories. Reconductoring provides tangible capacity gains without the years-long controversy that often plagues long-distance lines, and is a neat middle way between doing nothing or undertaking big headline-grabbing build-outs.

Implications For Rates Reliability And Renewables

Power prices in the project area already have a tendency to fall below the national average, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Still, customers are experiencing the sting from congestion charges and reliability must-run costs when the grid is tight. More production capacity can back up peak demand, stabilize price spikes, and attenuate the constriction of wind and solar production in resource-rich areas.

Speed matters. Reconductored projects can be planned and built on a time scale of quarters rather than years, whereas large greenfield transmission lines often require the better part of a decade to get permitted and constructed. That pace of progress jibes with warnings from grid operators and reliability planners that capacity additions and load growth—driven by data centers, electrification and reshoring of industry—are outstripping today’s transmission capacity.

The move is also consistent with continuing federal rulemakings. Recent Federal Energy Regulatory Commission orders seek to promote better long-term transmission planning and clarify backstop siting authority. Near-term upgrades like AEP’s can help narrow the gap while wider reforms take hold.

A Narrow but Prominent Policy Signal on Transmission

This doesn’t mean an acceptance in full of its predecessor’s grid agenda, not least because larger grants are on the chopping block. But it does indicate that the administration is open to backing targeted, low-friction efforts promising reliability and bill savings, even if they are limited in scope.

For both utilities and developers, the message is clear: incremental capacity expansions using existing corridors with consumer benefits are the most likely to get federal support. Whether it extends to meatier, multi-state transmission projects will determine how soon the U.S. can tamp down on congestion, integrate new generation and accommodate growing demand while keeping costs in control.",https://www.findarticles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image_1760740709_1.jpeg,N,,2025-10-18 13:02:07.078320

The solar program is a Biden administration initiative intended to help low-income families access renewable energy, something President Donald Trump has categorized as expensive and unreliable.

Administered by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Solar for All program was established by the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022. Administrator Lee Zeldin announced the program’s cancellation in August, citing the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that Trump signed into law in July, which he said eliminated the program’s funding source.

The cancellation puts federal grants to 60 state, local and tribal governments in question, NBC News reported. The program was designed to provide solar panels and battery storage to approximately 900,000 low-income households across the country. Recipients had already begun planning projects based on expected funding.

What’s at stake for states?

California Attorney General Rob Bonta announced two separate lawsuits on behalf of states that received Solar for All grants. One complaint seeks monetary damages and was filed in the Court of Federal Claims. A second suit asking for reinstatement of the program is expected in federal court in Washington state.

Bonta called the EPA’s decision an “illegal termination,” adding that the Trump administration “can try all they want to bend the law, but we will hold them accountable. Every time.”

California stands to lose about $250 million in approved funding. Arizona would forfeit $156 million that was slated to benefit 11,000 low-income households, Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes said in Reuters. Mayes said those families could see energy bills jump by 20% without the assistance.

Why did the administration cancel the program?

The Trump administration has consistently opposed federal subsidies for renewable energy projects. Zeldin called Solar for All a “boondoggle” when announcing its termination.

Trump has characterized solar and wind power as expensive, unreliable and unworthy of government backing, as opposed to gas, coal and nuclear, which have received strong support. His administration has rolled back multiple clean energy initiatives that were established under previous leadership.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act provided the legal mechanism to eliminate Solar for All’s funding stream. That law was part of broader efforts to reduce government spending and refocus energy policy away from renewable sources.

What are the other lawsuits over Solar for All?

The states’ Thursday filing joins earlier legal actions from other affected parties.

On Oct. 6, a coalition filed suit in federal court in Rhode Island, The New York Times reported. The lead plaintiff was the Rhode Island AFL-CIO, representing labor unions that had trained workers to install solar panels. The unions were counting on work from a $49.3 million grant to the Rhode Island Office of Energy Resources.

Zooming out, solar waste is still dwarfed by waste from coal and fossil fuel energy.","SAVANNAH, Ga.—What happens when a solar panel dies?

The vexing question hung last week over the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) sustainability conference, the first of its kind for the nonprofit representing America’s solar industry.

According to the International Energy Agency, up to 78 million tons of solar panels are expected to retire around the world by 2050, the largest waste stream of any clean-energy technology in history. Dubbed the “solar waste tsunami,” the wave of these retirements is projected to accelerate through the 2030s and 2040s as the first generation of large-scale solar farms reaches the end of its life.

To get ahead of this looming waste crisis, the Environmental Protection Agency announced in 2023 that it would craft a new rule to reclassify retired solar panels as “universal waste,” a category for materials that need specialized handling, like batteries, pesticides and mercury-containing devices.

“This change in the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act regulations, once finalized,” should benefit the wide variety of establishments generating and managing solar panel waste by providing a clear, practical system for handling discarded solar panels,” the EPA said.

The rulemaking was supposed to begin in June 2025 and be completed by December 2026, according to the EPA’s policymaking timetable in the Federal Registry.

“They were supposed to come out with this proposed rulemaking in June of this year, but we didn’t see that yet,” Anna Weitz, a clean energy engineer with the North Carolina Clean Energy Technology Center, said during a panel discussion on national and local policy on solar panel decommissioning. The technology center tracks policies on solar panel waste.

Asked for comment, the EPA said in an email that it has revised its rulemaking calendar to start in February 2026 and finish by August 2027.

The delay leaves the U.S. without a federal framework for managing millions of tons of panels nearing the end of their 25- to 30-year lifespans.

To understand why solar panel decommissioning and recycling matters and how it works requires knowledge of the materials involved. A solar panel is mostly glass (about 70 to 80 percent), with 10 percent aluminum, 10 percent polymers and a small but valuable mix of silver, copper, tin and lead. To recycle them, those layers have to be painstakingly separated.

Decommissioning is the process of dismantling and disposing of panels that have reached the end of their lives and ensuring the sites they occupied are left safe and stable. Ideally, recycling is part of that process, allowing valuable materials inside the panels to be recovered rather than discarded.

Glass can be reused for new panels or bottles. Silver and copper can be melted down and sold. But lead and other heavy metals are toxic, requiring careful extraction and disposal to prevent leaching into soil or groundwater.

“Solar panels aren’t just an installation, where you leave them and forget them. We have end-of-life solutions that are responsible, that are well thought out, that are … a very attractive business,” said Adam Sokolski, the policy director at EDF Renewables North America, the clean energy subsidiary of the France-owned utility giant.

So far, 35 states have adopted some form of solar decommissioning or waste policy, according to a tracker managed by the N.C. Clean Energy Technology Center. Of them, less than 10 have policies to recycle the retiring panels.

The remaining 15 states, including solar powerhouses Florida and Arizona, still have no statewide rules for retiring of panels. In those places, unless local governments act, most retired panels end up in landfills, where their valuable metals are lost and their toxins can leach into the environment.

New Jersey is one of the few states where both state and local governments oversee solar projects. Its Right to Farm Act requires that projects on farmland include decommissioning as part of their conservation plans, filed with the local soil conservation district. In the Pinelands reserve, developers must add a similar plan to their landscaping proposal. The state doesn’t require funds to be set aside for cleanup, but local governments may.

The demand to properly recycle or dispose of these expired panels has led to a nascent but growing industry of solar panel recyclers, mostly third-party companies that solar companies contract to handle the recycling and disposal process. Many of the recyclers gathered here at the solar industries conference, wanting consistent guidance on how to do their jobs.

Without federal regulations, states have been forced to go their own way, with recyclers following “inconsistent” rules, said Weitz.

“The goal of policy is to establish a level of certainty,” said Connor Hogan, chief financial officer of solar recycling company OnePlanet.

To create stable demand, many of these recyclers want states and local governments to pass a baseline policy of enforcing landfill bans, which would forbid developers from throwing expired solar panels away and instead seek out recycling firms.

A solar decommissioning policy widely panned by the industry was Washington State’s 2017 Photovoltaic Module Stewardship and Takeback Program, which required manufacturers to submit a “stewardship plan” detailing how they would finance and manage the collection and recycling of solar panels sold in the state or risk being barred from the market.

The rule drew strong backlash from the solar industry, which argued the requirements were unclear, burdensome and premature given the lack of recycling infrastructure. The state senate amended the law to delay enforcement to 2030.

Only California and Hawaii have formally reclassified solar panels as universal waste, giving them a clear path for collection and recycling.

For communities, particularly those near large solar farms or waste sites, the absence of federal standards means less oversight of where panels go once decommissioned, raising environmental justice concerns over toxic exposure and missed economic opportunities like job creation from recycling.

The Trump administration has shown little appetite for advancing new federal rules on solar-panel waste; instead, its broader environmental agenda has focused on deregulation, rolling back climate mandates and cutting support for clean energy programs.

In the European Union, solar panels fall under the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment or the WEEE Directive, which makes manufacturers financially responsible for collecting and recycling panels. Since 2018, EU member states were required to recover 85 percent and recycle 80 percent of panels. Untreated panels are banned from landfills.

Industry-led groups like PV Cycle manage takeback systems across Europe, making the EU the world’s most advanced region in solar panel waste regulation.

Zooming out, solar waste is still dwarfed by waste from coal and fossil fuel energy. A Nature Physics paper called solar panel waste “a drop in the ocean” compared to the vast quantities of coal ash, mine tailings and billions of gallons of toxic produced water generated by fossil fuel industries. According to the paper’s estimate, cumulative solar panel waste through 2050 will reach between 54 million and 160 million metric tons, while coal ash alone would be 300 to 800 times greater and oily sludge from crude oil 2 to 5 times larger.

“In fact, we globally produce and manage approximately the same mass of coal ash per month as the amount of [solar panel] module waste we expect to produce over the next 35 years,” the paper’s authors said.",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SolarDismantling-1024x530.jpg,N,,2025-10-18 05:58:59.968213

This is one story to follow closely—especially for EV manufacturers, energy storage companies, policy makers, and clean energy investors.","In a landmark development for clean energy and electric mobility, scientists at the Research Institute for Sustainable Energy (RISE) under TCG-CREST, Kolkata, have created India’s first indigenous sodium-ion battery that can charge to 94 percent in just five minutes. This announcement marks a pivotal moment in the race to develop alternatives to lithium-ion technology that are lower cost, less dependent on critical materials, and suited to local manufacturing.

What the Scientists Have Achieved

Ultra-fast Charging & High Energy Density

The prototype sodium-ion pouch cells engineered by the RISE team boast an energy density of ~180 Wh/kg and volumetric energy of ~ 550 Wh/L

These figures allow them to exceed or rival many lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries currently used in EVs and energy storage

The battery delivers a power output of ~10 kW/kg and maintains ~97 percent capacity across many cycles

Materials & Design Advantages

Importantly, the design uses no cobalt, nickel, copper or lithium — instead relying on more abundant, non-toxic materials

The scientists mention they developed a proprietary electrode design and electrolyte formulation to support fast ion transport and structural stability even under rapid charging

The battery is engineered to remain thermally stable and to function across extreme temperatures — a critical requirement for real world use in India and similar climates

Why This Is Important

Reducing Dependence on Critical Imports

Lithium, cobalt, nickel and copper are subject to supply constraints, geopolitical risk, and high costs. By contrast, sodium is abundant, inexpensive, and available within India. This innovation supports the “Atmanirbhar Bharat” (self-reliant India) vision by reducing reliance on imported critical minerals

Lower Cost & Safer Chemistry

Sodium-ion batteries are inherently more tolerant to abuse, less prone to thermal runaway, and often safer in design. Coupled with lower raw material costs, they could become a competitive alternative to lithium-ion systems, particularly in large scale energy storage and mid-range electric vehicles.

Applications from EVs to Grid Storage

With rapid charging, high power, and robust cycle life, these batteries hold promise for sectors including:

Electric vehicles (2-, 3-, and 4-wheelers)

Renewable energy storage (solar, wind integration)

Microgrids and rural electrification

Backup power systems and heavy machinery

Strategic & Global Impact

If commercialized and scaled, this technology could shift competitive balance in battery manufacturing. India could emerge as a leader in low-cost battery tech, reducing the dominance of established players in China, South Korea, or other major battery producing nations.

Challenges & the Road Ahead

While the announcement is exciting, there remain key challenges and uncertainties before commercialization:

The researchers estimate that commercial applications could be feasible within 2–3 years, depending on development of local supply chains and further scale-up

Context: Sodium-Ion Battery Research Globally

Sodium-ion (Na-ion) battery technology has long been studied as a lower-cost alternative to lithium-ion (Li-ion). The main tradeoffs historically have been lower energy density and slower charging. Researchers worldwide have experimented with novel cathodes (e.g., NASICON, Prussian blue analogs), engineered electrolytes, and nanostructured electrodes to overcome these challenges

In India, earlier work reported a sodium-ion battery that could charge up to 80% in ~6 minutes using a NASICON-type cathode/anode structure, but that design did not reach the same energy densities or fast charge extremes as the RISE innovation. The new RISE result appears to push the envelope further.

The Big Picture: What This Means for India & the World

Energy sovereignty: India can reduce its dependence on imported lithium battery systems, and develop domestic battery manufacturing capabilities.

Cost reduction: More affordable battery storage could make EVs, solar + battery systems, and microgrids much more accessible.

Competitive edge: If the technology scales well, Indian battery firms can compete globally.

Acceleration of clean energy adoption: With faster charging and reliable battery performance, the adoption curve for EVs and renewable energy systems could steepen.

Final Thoughts

The development of a sodium-ion battery in India that can charge to 94% in 5 minutes is a significant scientific and technological milestone. It addresses key challenges of cost, resource dependence, safety, and charging speed. However, the journey from prototype to commercial viability remains long and complex.

If India (or any country) can successfully scale and industrialize this technology, the ripple effects could transform the energy and mobility sectors.

Our performance in this area will ultimately increase investment in new nuclear fuels.” Cory Hatch is a science writer for Idaho National Laboratory.","Instead of clamping down, Maupin maneuvers the clawlike tongs within millimeters of the fuel rod and hovers there. Another operator, Rob Cox, cuts through the fuel rod with a slow-speed diamond saw. The moment Cox finishes the cut, the section of the fuel rod drops away and Maupin snags it in midair with the manipulator tongs.

“Nice catch,” Cox says.

Over the coming months, Cox, Maupin, and their colleagues will repeat this operation dozens of times as they prepare next-generation fuel rods—designed and built by Westinghouse and irradiated in a commercial reactor—for postirradiation examination and testing.

Engineers designed the fuel to be accident tolerant and achieve high burnup.

Accident tolerant characteristics offer improved safety performance during normal operations, power spikes, and reactor accidents. These same characteristics can enable the fuel rods to achieve higher burnup (e.g., increased use of the fissionable uranium-235 in the fuel pellet) that could increase the electricity output of power plants and extend operating cycles—think increased horsepower and better fuel economy.

The stakes are high. These accident tolerant fuels (ATFs) could eventually power the entire U.S. reactor fleet.

Together, these technologies could save electricity ratepayers millions of dollars per year while increasing a nuclear power plant’s resilience under potential (though highly unlikely) accident conditions.

But first, industry and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission need terabytes of data on how those fuels perform. INL is one of the few places in the world with the capabilities and experts to quantify how nuclear fuel behaves during normal operating and accident conditions.

The chance to put high-burnup fuels and ATFs through their paces is the opportunity of a lifetime for the scores of INL experts involved in the tests. Now, after years of preparation, the tests are finally underway.

A long time coming

Discussions of a Westinghouse fuel shipment to INL began roughly a decade ago, but the real history of the fuel rods began in the wake of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and subsequent tsunami. These combined events ravaged the Japanese coastline and severely damaged several reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. The plant power supplies and cooling systems for three of the four reactors were disabled, ultimately leading to significant core damage and the release of radioactive materials. This outcome might have been prevented if emergency personnel had more time to navigate washed up debris to deliver emergency electrical power or additional cooling water.

ATFs could provide plant operators with this increased margin for safety during abnormal operating conditions and, during an accident, could provide additional time to implement safety measures.

An added benefit of ATFs is that they can power a reactor longer, a feature known as high burnup. This feature is the nuclear industry’s immediate solution to provide the energy necessary to drive the modern economy, especially emerging needs for data centers driving artificial intelligence applications. Such fuels are designed to produce more energy, burning longer inside conventional light water reactors.

To answer those dual needs, Westinghouse is one of several companies that, under cooperative agreements with the U.S. Department of Energy, developed fuel with accident tolerant and high-burnup characteristics. After three rounds of irradiation testing at INL, the Westinghouse fuel was inserted in a commercial reactor in 2019.

Oak Ridge National Laboratory received a shipment of the Westinghouse fuel in 2021 for examination and testing in its Severe Accident Test Station, and INL received its first shipment of the fuel in December 2023.

Examining the fuel

Shielded by the four-foot-thick, multipaned windows at INL’s Hot Fuel Examination Facility, operators rely on an odd mixture of high and low tech to perform nondestructive and destructive examinations of the fuel and prepare it for irradiation tests. Alongside lasers and gamma spectrometers, there are rows of open-ended wrenches hanging on the wall.

Before Cox and Maupin make the fine cut to the fuel rods with their diamond saw, operators use a regular pipe cutter—the kind a plumber might use—to make a rough cut. The cutting locations are marked using a Sharpie wrapped in tape, which makes the marker easier to grip with the clawlike remote manipulators.

A thorough examination of the fuel rods, which have already sustained 54 months of neutron damage in the commercial reactor, establishes baseline data. This data will help researchers better understand how next-generation fuels might behave in a reactor accident.

“We perform extensive nondestructive examination so we can gather as much information as possible before starting destructive examinations,” said Aaron Colldeweih, lead investigator for the postirradiation examination of the Westinghouse fuel. “We’ll do visual exams, gamma spectrometry, and we’ll closely measure the diameter of the rods. That will give us an idea of how the cladding and the fuel interacted with each other during irradiation.”

As the U-235 in the fuel undergoes fission in the reactor, various radionuclides are created. Gamma spectrometry is used to detect the gamma radiation field being emitted from the rod at incremental steps along its entire length.

“We’re measuring gamma emissions at a very high resolution along the length of the rod,” Colldeweih said. “That allows us to define the location of the physical features that were part of the fuel assembly, like spacer grids or, inside the rod, like individual fuel pellets. This information helps guide us on where we want to cut the fuel rod for destructive examinations.”

Because each radionuclide emits a unique signature, the data also provide a glimpse into the irradiation history of the rod and the chemical behavior of the specific fission product species created by the fission process.

Another examination called profilometry closely measures surface dimensions of the rod. When those data are compared with the fuel rod’s original measurements, researchers can calculate how much the cladding dimensions changed over the lifetime of the fuel, where the cladding initially shrinks down around the fuel pellets and then expands as the fuel swells (primarily due to internal gas pressure). The internal pressure increases throughout irradiation as gaseous fission products accumulate inside the fuel rod. This measurement is used to estimate the remaining margin to failure.

Segmentation and destructive tests

Now the fuel rod is ready for segmentation and destructive tests, including irradiation tests, in the Advanced Test Reactor (ATR) or in the Transient Reactor Test (TREAT) Facility at INL’s Materials and Fuels Complex.

Using a laser, researchers make a tiny puncture in the cladding to sample the fission gases that formed during irradiation and directly measure the gas pressure and the free volume within the rod. Samples of the gas are collected to perform compositional analysis.

“We start with13-foot-long fuel rods, and we need to get them into segments of about 10 inches for future TREAT tests,” Colldeweih said. “It involves fine cutting with very high accuracy. We also take a number of different samples from each fuel rod for isotopic and hydrogen measurements that ultimately support additional experiments required to understand material behavior and properties relevant to future fuel rod design.”

Experts then cut away sections of the cladding and fuel and prepare the samples for examination under conventional microscopes and electron microscopes at INL.

The microscopes allow researchers to see damage and changes that occurred during irradiation, such as cracks and pores in the fuel. The microscopes can also help identify where hydrogen-bearing phases, called hydrides, have precipitated in the cladding. These hydrides, which mostly arise from corrosion of the cladding in the reactor, can cause the cladding to become embrittled. Measuring that hydrogen provides important clues to understand damage incurred in the reactor core.

“There are interesting regions in the shape of rings to indicate how the fuel’s microstructure has evolved,” Colldeweih said. “It’s what happens to the fuel after it has been irradiated for a length of time, and it’s important for understanding how the fuel will behave in an accident scenario—and for understanding what’s going to happen in TREAT.”

Other samples of the cladding are subjected to mechanical tests that push, pull, or expand the sample to its breaking point to test its strength. “We will mill out different dog-bone shapes from the cladding wall, and we can test the sample strength in different directions,” Colldeweih said. “We perform axial-tension tests and hoop-tension tests, which allow us to measure the mechanical response of the material.”

Researchers also take density measurements of the fuel to learn how fission gases—which cause tiny bubbles and create porosity—and thermal expansion have changed the fuel’s density. “We want to know if the density changed from its nominal value and how that affects its performance and accident tolerance,” Colldeweih said.

The ultimate test: Accident conditions in TREAT

Much like the automobile industry, safety features must be demonstrated under extreme conditions to validate their performance. The hot cell examinations ultimately culminate in the nuclear equivalent of ramming several sports cars into a concrete wall.

In this case, sports cars are advanced fuel rods and the concrete wall is TREAT: a nuclear test reactor designed to deliver a short, high-intensity burst of radiation to push nuclear fuels and materials to their limit and beyond. In other words, TREAT is designed to break things under accident scenarios, much like crash testing a car.

“We want to know if a fuel will fail in a reactor and how it will fail,” said Jordan Argyle, one of the researchers involved in refabricating the fuel rods for the tests. “The only way to find out is to do the testing.”

“This may be the coolest thing happening at [INL’s Materials and Fuels Complex],” Argyle continued.

Fabricating rodlets for accident testing

The rodlet must be capable of withstanding internal pressures of over 1,000 psi to accommodate the fission gases that result from the tests.

Once the rodlet is ready, “we need to load in a bunch of rodlet internals,” Argyle said. “There are pellets of a ceramic material that create a thermal buffer to keep heat from melting the end caps. They also help replicate the thermodynamics of a big fuel rod in a reactor. There are also springs to keep it all together. It’s an extremely tight fit.”

Then the end caps are welded onto the cladding. Throughout this process, experts use spotting scopes—the same kind that hunters use—to inspect the weld.

Technicians then use a small hole, 20 thousandths of an inch in diameter, through which they inject a mixture of helium and argon gases to replicate the thermal properties of a fission gas mixture. That hole is then welded shut.

The endcaps are heavily instrumented so researchers can get live data out of the fuel rod while it is in the reactor. These sensors measure everything from acoustic emissions and capsule pressure to temperature and mechanical movement.

“We just completed the easiest fabrication,” Argyle said. “They’re going to continue to get more complicated. Some of the sensors have wires, and you have to be careful not to destroy the wires. Some have much more volume and much higher pressures, and they’re talking about welding thermocouples [devices that measure temperature] directly onto the cladding.”

Once experts have segmented the 13-foot fuel rods and taken samples of the fuel and the cladding, each segment must be reassembled into a sealed rodlet for insertion into the transient water irradiation system (TWIST) capsule—an experiment capsule designed for specialized testing. The process requires a high degree of precision for the rodlet to perform like a normal fuel rod.

“The purpose of refabrication is to get it as prototypical as possible to a real fuel rod,” Argyle said.

Completing each rodlet takes a team of dedicated experts. “There are probably 26 people, from receipt to welding, who are integral to this process,” Argyle said. “If you took any one of those people away, we wouldn’t be able to do this.”

Once the rodlet is assembled and tested in the rodlet holder, the TWIST device is assembled, and the rodlet is loaded inside. This integrated configuration—the TWIST capsule—is then ready for the experiment.

To ensure safety, once the TWIST module is assembled, it is placed inside an irradiation system known as Big-BUSTER (broad use specimen transient experiment rig). The 9-foot-long zirconium-niobium alloy pipe provides the safety pressure boundary used for irradiation testing in TREAT.

The experiment, housed in Big-BUSTER, is transferred to TREAT via a shielded cask. The experiment is then inserted into TREAT and all instrumentation is checked out to determine functionality after shipping and handling.

INL technicians will fabricate three more rodlets in the next fiscal year, with two to six rodlets fabricated each year thereafter for the foreseeable future.

“The sheer volume of data we’re able to collect has a lot of people interested,” Argyle said.

Mimicking accident scenarios

One type of test performed in the TWIST device is a loss-of-coolant accident (LOCA), a type of postulated accident in a commercial power plant where the water drains out of reactor core due to a highly unlikely severe disruption of its mechanical systems. In this scenario, the core could heat up, resulting in several potential consequences, including a release of radioactivity due to fuel damage (popularly referred to as a meltdown). Next-generation nuclear fuels like the ATF rods from Westinghouse are designed to minimize the chance and severity of these consequences.

TWIST looks a little like a barbell tipped on its end and features two chambers. The top chamber—the TWIST capsule—holds nuclear fuel, water, and instrumentation.

During a LOCA test, TREAT reactor operators bombard the fuel, surrounded by water, in the TWIST capsule with an intense burst of radiation for around 30 seconds. This burst of radiation establishes thermal conditions like a normal operating fuel pin in a commercial reactor. Then, the accident event simulation starts by draining the water into an empty tank at the bottom chamber of the TWIST capsule.

Operators then subject the fuel rod, minus the water, to a lower-level radiation burst for 100 additional seconds, simulating the fuel rods’ residual heat generation during an accident. Both the irradiation times and TREAT power levels can be easily modified by the experimenter and are adjusted based on the test’s specific objectives.

Normally, the rodlet increases in temperature until the specimen fails, acccording to Klint Anderson, an experiment design engineer at INL. “In other words, the rod gets really hot,” he said. “This increase in temperature, combined with the pressure differential between the pressurized rod and lower-pressure capsule, can cause the cladding to balloon and burst.”

While a loss-of-coolant condition (known as an undercooling scenario) is the more restrictive safety event, the system can also be used to explore other types of events, such as reactivity insertion accidents (known as overpower scenarios). In a reactivity insertion accident test, TREAT operators bombard the submerged fuel rod with a pulse of neutron radiation that simulates sudden removal of a control rod from a commercial reactor core. During this test, the water never drains from the TWIST capsule.

“The water remains at the same water level the whole time,” Anderson said. “We put it in TREAT with a higher-power pulse to look at things like the pellet cladding mechanical interaction or sudden pressure spikes from the water quickly boiling.”

Once the experiments are completed in TREAT, the rodlets will be transferred back to the Hot Fuel Examination Facility for disassembly and post-transient examinations, which will occur over the summer and fall of 2025.

Why these tests are important

In the end, “crash testing” these high-burnup and ATF rods will help industry license these rods’ designs for reactors operating across the country. The result is safer, higher-performing nuclear reactors.

“The advanced fuel is special because it marks a new era of innovation for commercial LWRs,” said Dan Wachs, national technical director of the DOE’s Advanced Fuels Campaign at INL.

“Innovation in the LWR community stagnated for several decades,” he said. “The start of the Accident Tolerant Fuels program really started a reawakening of the desire for innovation in the commercial nuclear reactor sector.”

It took about 10 years to get the initial ideas for advanced fuels to the point where researchers could perform demonstrations in commercial reactors.

“But to really assess them properly, we need to do examinations in our hot cells,” Wachs said.

INL is one of the best and, in some cases, the only place for companies to get data about their fuels to verify their performance and ultimately get approval from the NRC. With the success of the initial experiments in TREAT, the nuclear energy industry will gain confidence that its innovations can be commercialized.

“By examining and testing fuels from Westinghouse and other manufacturers, INL researchers are providing industry with a clear pathway to get their fuels to market,” Wachs said. “Success just generates an appetite for more innovation. Our performance in this area will ultimately increase investment in new nuclear fuels.”

The proposed BESS fire safety codes will go a long way to reduce the risk of thermal runaways within new BESS installations in New York.

Standardise fire safety codes: Fragmented fire safety codes and regulations create headaches for developers and confusion across the industry.
Moving forward, BESS safety codes should introduce stronger fire safety protections.","New York State is one of the biggest advocates of battery energy storage systems (BESS) technology in the US, setting an ambitious target of 6GW of energy storage by 2030. They are pushing ahead with multiple new projects despite significant headwinds from community opposition groups. In the last year alone, the state broke ground on 7.5MW of capacity and approved a further five BESS projects totalling 42.5MW.

Yet a string of isolated, high-profile BESS fires over the last few years in the state (Jefferson, Orange, and Suffolk counties) has created public unease about the technology and emboldened local opposition groups that threaten projects at a pivotal stage in the energy transition. Local opposition groups have also increasingly used evocative language, such as “BESS is a clear and present danger to our health and financial well-being”, to stir up opposition to projects.

In response, State officials have introduced a new set of BESS fire safety codes aimed at addressing public concerns and enhancing site safety. While New York’s BESS fire safety codes represent a crucial first step for BESS safety, serving as a regulatory model for other states, more must be done to protect sites and reassure communities about their safety.

The proposed BESS fire safety codes will go a long way to reduce the risk of thermal runaways within new BESS installations in New York. It is a welcome innovation of public policy that will support BESS adoption.

Why New York’s fire safety codes are a good start

Until now, there have been only a very limited number of fire safety codes or regulations specifically designed to protect BESS sites against fire risks. That’s why New York’s new BESS fire safety codes – officially adopted in July this year (2025) – mark a significant step forward for the industry when it comes to fire safety. Under the new codes, developers are required to:

These new codes clearly set a solid baseline for fire safety standards within the BESS industry, and they will go some way to reassuring the public that sites are being properly protected. However, the new safety codes do not go as far as offering guidance for developers/owners to include fire safety protection – a key talking point for community action groups. Without strong fire safety protections, New York and the industry as a whole risk stalling the rollout of BESS sites, held up by influential community groups. Given the recent flurry of high-profile isolated BESS fires, the safety code detailing requirements to protect sites will help mitigate community opposition.

Strengthening fire safety standards to build public trust

To address public safety concerns and gain support from critics, regulators, and developers must collaborate to establish comprehensive fire safety regulations that include:

1. Mandate advanced fire detection and suppression systems: Requiring all BESS sites to have advanced fire detection and suppression systems installed from the start is critical to winning over opponents. In fact, a recent report from Firetrace International, which surveyed nearly 4,000 citizens across the US, found that 66% of US citizens would support a BESS project if fire suppression systems were installed from the outset.

2. Standardise fire safety codes: Fragmented fire safety codes and regulations create headaches for developers and confusion across the industry. By establishing consistent and clear fire safety standards across the industry, we can enhance fire protection, ultimately helping to alleviate public opposition.

3. Transparent incident reporting: Making sure developers share data and information on recent fire incidents is essential to improving safety standards and updating fire safety codes. This includes creating public databases that regulators, firefighters, developers, and the public can access to see what went wrong, what was fixed, and how sites are being made safer.

4. Disclose fire safety plans: Requiring developers to disclose their fire safety plans and the steps they have taken to protect sites will go a long way to securing public support. Firetrace’s survey found that 47% of US citizens would be more comfortable with a BESS site if they had a clear understanding of the safety measures, demonstrating the importance of introducing fire safety disclosure requirements.

The successful rollout of BESS hinges on the industry reassuring the public that sites are safe, secure, and will create significant benefits for the community. But, as it stands, many locals are concerned about having BESS sites in their backyard, which is understandable given the recent isolated fires that have hit the front pages.

As an industry, we need to do more to reassure the public that BESS is a relatively safe technology and demonstrate that we’re doing all we can to protect sites and improve safety standards. New York’s new fire safety codes are a significant first step toward achieving this. Moving forward, BESS safety codes should introduce stronger fire safety protections. This will help win over community opposition groups and accelerate the rollout of one of the most important technologies of our generation, which is vital for achieving sustainability targets such as net-zero by 2050.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltb299798942522069/bltfe9b47e05a5cb35d/68f2850c8fbaca10462a3884/BESS.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-10-18 14:03:57.496930

Unlike other public two-year colleges, Texas State Technical College does not have taxing authority to issue bonds, and underfunding has led to a halt in critical capital improvements.
The state would help pick up the tab for the amount of property tax revenue school districts would lose.","On Nov. 4, Texas voters will get the final say on 17 constitutional amendments — usually listed as statewide propositions at the top of the ballot — including billions of dollars in property tax cuts for homeowners and businesses.

Earlier this year, a two-thirds majority of the state Legislature passed the joint resolutions calling for the constitutional amendment elections, along with the state’s budget for the next two years, which includes $51 billion for property tax cuts.

Texas lawmakers have used multibillion-dollar budget surpluses, the result of inflation and temporary federal stimulus dollars during the COVID-19 pandemic, to pay for tax cuts in recent years. Proponents of tax cuts and bans, including Gov. Greg Abbott, have said they will maintain Texas as a competitive, business-friendly state and contribute to economic growth.

But some lawmakers and budget analysts have raised concerns that passing more tax cuts, especially on school district taxes which the state helps pay for, could be unsustainable.

“We always have to kind of balance giving folks tax relief versus making sure that we still preserve revenue for those public services,” said Shannon Halbrook, a fiscal policy director for the left-leaning Every Texan.

With lots of tax cuts and tax bans, especially through these upcoming constitutional amendment elections, the state and local governments could face a hard time paying for public services such as education, health care, and infrastructure needs in the future, Halbrook said.

Officials with Texas cities and counties say they are already being forced to either cut spending or raise taxes and fees to make up for budgets stretched thin by economic uncertainty, inflation, strict state limits on property tax collections and uncertainty around future federal funds. That’s why some Texans, like voters in Austin, will also see local propositions asking them to approve increasing local property tax rates.

If the constitutional amendments are approved, a majority of state lawmakers and Texas voters would need to pass new constitutional amendments to undo measures. Constitutional amendments are the only ballot propositions Texans get to vote on at the state level and will appear on the top of voters’ ballots, above any local races or measures they may be deciding.

To weigh in on the constitutional amendments, Texas voters need to be registered to vote by Oct. 6. Early voting will run from Oct. 20-31, and election day is Nov. 4. The deadline for counties to receive applications to vote by mail is Oct. 24. For more information on voting requirements, read our guide to voting in Texas.

Here’s a brief breakdown of the constitutional amendments.

A majority of the proposed constitutional amendments are measures meant to lower taxes for various Texans, including:

Homeowners.

Businesses.

Elderly and disabled homeowners.

Spouses of veterans.

Homeowners who had their home destroyed in a fire.

Property owners with border security infrastructure.

Those who sell animal feed.

Other proposed amendments would prevent the state from imposing additional taxes on:

Personal or business capital gains.

Securities transactions and those working in securities.

Inheritances.

Other proposals would fund:

Water infrastructure.

The Texas State Technical College.

Research on dementia treatment and prevention.

A few proposals would amend the constitution to:

Limit when a person can be released on bail.

Enshrine parental rights.

Clarify citizenship requirements for Texas voters.

Overhaul the State Commission on Judicial Conduct.

Read more below about what each proposition will look like on the ballot and what it would mean for Texans.

Proposition 1 (SJR 59): Texas State Technical College funding

The ballot language: “The constitutional amendment providing for the creation of the permanent technical institution infrastructure fund and the available workforce education fund to support the capital needs of educational programs offered by the Texas State Technical College System.”

What it means: This amendment would create an endowment for the Texas State Technical College Program.

Unlike other public two-year colleges, Texas State Technical College does not have taxing authority to issue bonds, and underfunding has led to a halt in critical capital improvements. If voters approve the constitutional amendment, TSTC officials have said they will use the money to fix campus infrastructure, upgrade classroom equipment and expand its footprint across the state.

This comes after Gov. Greg Abbott made workforce training a priority during the regular legislative session. Texas employers have been signaling a decline in skilled workers for fields such as plumbing and welding, saying this could threaten Texas’ economy.

Proponents of this allocation of funds say it would help build facilities for training and close the skills gap in Texas. Critics have said creating an endowment for TSTC would limit government spending oversight and transparency. — Olla Mokhtar, Sneha Dey

Proposition 2 (SJR 18): Capital gains tax ban

The ballot language: “The constitutional amendment prohibiting the imposition of a tax on the realized or unrealized capital gains of an individual, family, estate, or trust.”

What it means: This would ban the state from taxing people or businesses on profits or potential profits from capital assets, such as investments, real estate, valuable items and certain personal property. It would also eliminate a franchise tax on business trusts, which would lead the state to lose an estimated $152,000 in revenue per fiscal year, according to the state comptroller’s office.

Proponents of the capital gains tax ban say it doubles down on the state’s income tax ban, which was approved by voters in 2019. State lawmakers suggested in an analysis they don’t want to repeat what happened in Washington state where officials there enacted a capital gains tax despite also prohibiting a state income tax. And during legislative discussions, state Rep. Giovanni Capriglione, a Republican from Southlake who sponsored the proposal, said that the franchise tax on business trusts “could be construed as a capital gains tax undermining Texas economic competitiveness.” — María Méndez

Proposition 3 (SJR 5): Bail reform

The ballot language: “The constitutional amendment requiring the denial of bail under certain circumstances to persons accused of certain offenses punishable as a felony.”

What it means: This proposition would require judges to deny bail in certain cases for individuals accused of committing specific felonies, such as murder, aggravated assault and indecency with a child. The state would have to demonstrate that bail is not enough to prevent the defendant from being a flight or public safety risk. Defendants, who are legally presumed innocent, would also be entitled to the right to an attorney during their bail hearings.

The proposal is part of a broad legislative package that Texas Republican leaders have said is needed to reduce violent crimes committed by people out on bond and to curb the ability of “activist judges” to set “weak bail.” Civil rights groups said keeping more people behind bars would add to overcrowded jails without actually improving public safety, while also pointing to a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that says “liberty is the norm, and detention prior to trial or without trial is the carefully limited exception.”

Under the Texas Constitution, most defendants have the right to be released on bail except for certain cases, such as those charged with capital murder or accused of certain repeat felonies. — Alex Nguyen

Proposition 4 (HJR 7): Water infrastructure funding

The ballot language: “The constitutional amendment to dedicate a portion of the revenue derived from state sales and use taxes to the Texas water fund and to provide for the allocation and use of that revenue.”

What it means: Texas’ water supply is facing numerous threats, including an increasing demand for water due to rapid population growth, millions of gallons of water leaking out of old infrastructure, and climate change contributing to more droughts and altering precipitation patterns. By one estimate, the state’s municipal supply will not meet demand by 2030 if a major drought were to hit the state and no water solutions are implemented.

A Texas 2036 report estimated that the state needs nearly $154 billion by 2050 for water infrastructure, including $59 billion for water supply projects, $74 billion for leaky pipes and infrastructure maintenance, and $21 billion to fix broken wastewater systems.

To help the state boost and protect its water supply, state lawmakers are asking voters to approve $20 billion for water projects over the next two decades. If approved, up to $1 billion of sales tax revenue would be deposited into the Texas Water Fund each year starting in 2027. The money would go to fixing aging pipes and other infrastructure; developing and increasing new water sources, such as desalination; flood mitigation projects; and supporting conservation efforts to help meet water demands.The amendment would also give the Texas Water Development Board flexibility in distributing funds. — Alejandra Martinez

Proposition 5 (HJR 99): Tax exemption on animal feed

The ballot language: “The constitutional amendment authorizing the legislature to exempt from ad valorem taxation tangible personal property consisting of animal feed held by the owner of the property for sale at retail.”

What it means: This constitutional amendment would allow state lawmakers to extend tax exemptions on animal feed to include when animal feed is held as inventory to be sold. State Rep. Cody Harris, R-Palestine, noted animal feed is already typically tax exempt when it is harvested or purchased by a farmer or rancher.

If the constitutional amendment is approved, accompanying legislation from Harris would exempt animal feed inventory from property taxes. That would lower local property tax revenue and require the state to help school districts make up for that loss, but those costs are not expected to be significant, according to a fiscal note from the state’s Legislative Budget Board.

Only a few individuals registered against the proposed constitutional amendment during legislative committee hearings. Critics have said this gives animal feed sellers an unfair advantage, according to the House Research Organization. — María Méndez

Proposition 6 (HJR 4): Securities tax ban

The ballot language: “The constitutional amendment prohibiting the legislature from enacting a law imposing an occupation tax on certain entities that enter into transactions conveying securities or imposing a tax on certain securities transactions.”

What it means: This proposal would prevent the state from creating new taxes on securities transactions, such as stock trading, and from taxing those who operate or work in the securities market, including financial institutions, brokers and dealers.

It was prompted by a new stock exchange expected to open in Texas and to protect investments, including retirement accounts and pensions, following discussions of taxing financial transactions in other states, according to analysis of the resolution calling for the constitutional amendment.

A few individuals registered against the proposal during legislative committee hearings, and critics have said the state could benefit from these taxes should it need to raise more revenue in the future, according to the House Research Organization. — María Méndez

Proposition 7 (HJR 133): Tax exemption for veterans’ spouses

The ballot language: “The constitutional amendment authorizing the legislature to provide for an exemption from ad valorem taxation of all or part of the market value of the residence homestead of the surviving spouse of a veteran who died as a result of a condition or disease that is presumed under federal law to have been service-connected.”

What it means: This change would allow state lawmakers to give property tax breaks on homes to the un-remarried spouses of U.S. veterans who the federal government determined died in connection to their service. State Rep. Chris Turner, D-Grand Prairie, said during legislative discussions that the change is meant to align Texas with a more recent federal law that expanded benefits for veterans exposed to toxic substances during their service.

Accompanying legislation by Turner would exempt qualifying spouses of veterans from paying any property taxes on their home if they have not remarried. The state would have to make up the reduced property tax revenue for local school districts, but it is not expected to be a significant cost, according to a fiscal note from the state’s Legislative Budget Board. An estimated 3,000 spouses could potentially benefit from the exemption, according to the fiscal note. — María Méndez

Proposition 8 (HJR 2): Inheritance tax ban

The ballot language: “The constitutional amendment to prohibit the legislature from imposing death taxes applicable to a decedent’s property or the transfer of an estate, inheritance, legacy, succession, or gift.”

What it means: Though Texas does not currently have an inheritance tax, this measure aims to prevent lawmakers from trying to impose a tax on an estate or when an estate or inheritance is transferred. It would not eliminate other existing taxes that can be associated with an inheritance, such as unpaid property taxes, according to committee discussions on the proposal. Critics of this constitutional amendment have said it is unnecessary and would limit state lawmakers in the future, according to the House Research Organization. — María Méndez

Proposition 9 (HJR 1): Inventory and equipment tax exemption

The ballot language: “The constitutional amendment to authorize the legislature to exempt from ad valorem taxation a portion of the market value of tangible personal property a person owns that is held or used for the production of income.”

What it means: This amendment, along with accompanying legislation, would exempt up to $125,000 of businesses’ inventory or equipment from being taxed by school districts, cities, counties or any other taxing entity. Under current law, businesses don’t have to pay taxes on that property if it’s worth $2,500 or less.

The state would help pick up the tab for the amount of property tax revenue school districts would lose. This would cost the state an estimated $193.5 million from general revenue in 2027 and more than $100 million annually from general revenue in subsequent fiscal years, according to a fiscal note from the Legislative Budget Board. Other taxing entities like cities and counties would either have to raise tax rates to make up for the lost revenue, or go without it.

Critics, including some local officials, have noted that the tax cuts could be applied by businesses at multiple locations, according to the House Research Organization. Proponents, including several business and industry associations, have said eliminating administrative and tax burdens for businesses would contribute to economic growth that could outweigh local revenue losses. Recapture payments, or the tax revenue that school districts with higher property values send back to the state to help fund poorer school districts, would also go down. — María Méndez, Joshua Fechter

Proposition 10 (SJR 84): Tax exemption for homes destroyed by fire

The ballot language: “The constitutional amendment to authorize the legislature to provide for a temporary exemption from ad valorem taxation of the appraised value of an improvement to a residence homestead that is completely destroyed by a fire.”

What it means: This amendment and accompanying legislation would create a process to temporarily lower property taxes on homes destroyed by fire. Homeowners could apply for an adjusted tax bill on the restored home for the year in which the fire occurred, according to the accompanying legislation. To qualify, the homeowner’s home would have to remain uninhabitable for at least 30 days after the fire. These property tax bill reductions could lower local tax revenue and require the state to help make up for school districts’ losses, but potential costs for the state could not be calculated, according to the legislation’s fiscal note. — María Méndez

Proposition 11 (SJR 85): School tax exemption for the elderly or disabled homeowners

The ballot language: “The constitutional amendment authorizing the legislature to increase the amount of the exemption from ad valorem taxation by a school district of the market value of the residence homestead of a person who is elderly or disabled.”

What it means: This constitutional amendment would allow the state to raise a homestead exemption, a discount on school property taxes that lowers how much of a home’s value can be taxed to pay for public schools. The increased exemption would shave off $60,000 from the taxable value of elderly or disabled Texans’ homes, rather than just $10,000 under the current exemption.

Coupled with another homestead exemption generally available to Texas homeowners, which lawmakers are also asking voters to increase to $140,000 through another ballot proposition, elderly or disabled Texans could get homestead exemptions of up to $200,000 if the other proposition is also approved by voters.

If the increased exemption for elderly or disabled homeowners is approved by voters, the state would have to help pay for revenue school districts lose. That could cost the state more than $1.2 billion in general revenue for the next two fiscal years and upwards of $477 million annually after that, according to a fiscal note from the state’s Legislative Budget Board. Recapture payments, or the tax revenue that school districts with higher property values send back to the state to help fund poorer school districts, would also go down.

Though these tax cuts for elderly and disabled Texans haven’t faced much public pushback, some have raised concerns that such broad exemptions could be unsustainable for the state to pay for in the future. — María Méndez, Joshua Fechter

Proposition 12 (SJR 27): Changing the State Judicial Conduct Commission

The ballot language: “The constitutional amendment regarding the membership of the State Commission on Judicial Conduct, the membership of the tribunal to review the commission’s recommendations, and the authority of the commission, the tribunal, and the Texas Supreme Court to more effectively sanction judges and justices for judicial misconduct.”

What it means: This amendment would change the make-up of Texas’ State Commission on Judicial Conduct and related processes and powers.

Currently, the State Commission on Judicial Conduct is made up of the following:

six judges from six different court levels,

two attorneys appointed by the State Bar of Texas who aren’t judges, and

five citizens appointed by the governor who are at least 30 years of age and aren’t attorneys or judges.

If approved, the constitutional amendment would beef up the citizen representation on the commission by changing the makeup to:

six judges or justices of courts appointed by the Texas Supreme Court of, two of whom would have to be trial court judges (judicial members of the commission would not be allowed to be judges in the same type of court), and

seven citizens appointed by the governor, who are at least 35 years of age.

Commission members would still have to be confirmed by the Texas Senate.

Other significant changes to the judicial conduct review process would tweak how the chief justice of the Texas Supreme Court selects review tribunals. These tribunals, made up of seven Court of Appeals justices, review the commission’s recommendation for the removal or retirement of a judge. The amendment would also adjust when and how the commission and review tribunal would have to discipline judges, including in some cases by prohibiting a person from holding judicial office in the future.

The terms of the current commissioners would expire by July 2026. A temporary provision in the constitutional amendment would authorize the Texas Supreme Court and the governor to begin appointing additional commissioners with staggered terms, of either six, four or two years, beginning in 2026.

Proponents of the proposed changes said they would promote transparency and accountability in the judicial system and allow judicial misconduct to be addressed fairly and swiftly. Some critics said that increasing the number of members of the public on the commission could politicize the judicial discipline process, according to the House Research Organization. — María Méndez

Proposition 13 (SJR 2): Increased school tax exemption for homeowners

The ballot language: “The constitutional amendment to increase the amount of the exemption of residence homesteads from ad valorem taxation by a school district from $100,000 to $140,000.”

What it means: This constitutional amendment would allow Texans who own their home to see a boost in the state’s homestead exemption, or the slice of a home’s value that can’t be taxed to pay for public schools. The proposal would shave off $140,000 off the taxable value of the home, instead of the current $100,000.

The owner of a typical Texas home — valued at $302,000 last year, according to Zillow — would have saved about $490 on their school property taxes had the higher exemption been in place last year, a Tribune calculation shows. Those savings result from a combination of the increased homestead exemption and cuts to school tax rates in the state’s upcoming two-year budget.

Accompanying legislation would put the state on the hook for the revenue school districts lose if the increased exemption passes. That’s estimated to cost the state more than $2.7 billion in general revenue for the 2026-2027 budget cycle and more than $1 billion annually after that, according to the fiscal note for the accompanying school finance legislation. Recapture payments, or the tax revenue that school districts with higher property values send back to the state to help fund poorer school districts, would also go down.

Some critics have said the state should do more to limit local tax rates and spending so that tax bills don’t continue to rise, according to the House Research Organization. — María Méndez, Joshua Fechter

Proposition 14 (SJR 3): Funding for dementia research and prevention

The ballot language: “The constitutional amendment providing for the establishment of the Dementia Prevention and Research Institute of Texas, establishing the Dementia Prevention and Research Fund to provide money for research on and prevention and treatment of dementia, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and related disorders in this state, and transferring to that fund $3 billion from state general revenue.”

What it means: This amendment would provide $3 billion to create the Dementia Prevention and Research Institute of Texas to study dementia, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s disease and other brain related conditions. The measure received bipartisan support from a majority of lawmakers and was one of Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick’s legislative priorities.

If voters approve the constitutional amendment, an initial $3 billion in state surplus revenue would be transferred to the fund, and a board appointed by Patrick, House Speaker Dustin Burrows, R-Lubbock, and Gov. Greg Abbott would be set up to approve research proposals. Going forward, the institute would receive up to $300 million annually. This funding is intended to attract physicians, researchers, and experts to Texas.

The fund and institute are modeled after the state’s Cancer Research and Prevention Institute, which has become the country’s second largest funder of cancer research. — Olla Mokhtar, Terri Langford

Proposition 15 (SJR 34): Codifying parental rights

The ballot language: “The constitutional amendment affirming that parents are the primary decision makers for their children.”

What it means: This proposal would include parental rights, as currently outlined out in federal case law, in the Texas Constitution. The intent of the amendment is to protect parental rights since “case law can change and disappear over time with the appointment of new judges,” according to an analysis of the legislation.

The constitution would be amended to include the following: “Provides that, to enshrine truths that are deeply rooted in this nation’s history and traditions, the people of Texas hereby affirm that a parent has the responsibility to nurture and protect the parent’s child and the corresponding fundamental right to exercise care, custody, and control of the parent’s child, including the right to make decisions concerning the child’s upbringing.”

Some questions were raised during legislative discussions about how the proposal would ensure children’s voices are also heard. — María Méndez

Proposition 16 (SJR 37): Clarifying citizenship requirement for voters

The ballot language: “The constitutional amendment clarifying that a voter must be a United States citizen.”

What it means: This amendment would add language to the Texas Constitution to explicitly say that “persons who are not citizens of the United States” cannot vote in the state. Though U.S. citizenship is already required to register to vote in Texas, this amendment aims to prevent local governments in Texas from allowing local residents who are not citizens to vote in local elections and comes in response to other states passing such policies, according to analysis of the legislation.

Critics of the measure said it is redundant and unnecessary. — María Méndez

Proposition 17 (HJR 34): Property tax exemption for border security infrastructure

The ballot language: “The constitutional amendment to authorize the legislature to provide for an exemption from ad valorem taxation of the amount of the market value of real property located in a county that borders the United Mexican States that arises from the installation or construction on the property of border security infrastructure and related improvements.”

What it means: This proposal and accompanying legislation would allow the state to prevent property value in border counties from increasing due to border security infrastructure and related improvements.

This new exemption could reduce local tax revenue, but costs to the state to help address school district losses are not expected to be significant, according to a fiscal note. Other local governments may have to raise tax rates to offset the losses, according to the fiscal note.

Proponents of the measure say this will address concerns that border security infrastructure added to private land by the state could increase that property’s appraisal and burden on property owners, according to the House Research Organization. Critics have said the state should not incentivize more border security infrastructure on private land and that the change could shift the tax burden to other local property owners. — María Méndez

On the other hand, the U.S. is grappling with whipsaw effects from slower-than-anticipated adoption, the loss of the $7,500 federal tax credit for EV purchases, implementation of tariffs on import vehicles and auto parts, and the rollback of emissions and other environmental standards.

If you're an auto investor who doesn't look fondly upon those developments, just wait a few minutes and it'll probably change, for better or worse. Here's the latest issue facing investors and the EV industry.

Profit-eroding incentives

With the federal $7,500 tax credit ending with the month of September, automakers trying to move EV inventory are digging into their own pockets to drive demand. General Motors (NYSE: GM) and Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) had previously found an intriguing loophole to use their finance arms to place down payments on EVs with intentions to pass that along to the consumer later. But both quickly ended those programs after pressure from politicians claimed the workarounds were ""nefarious."" Now the two Detroit auto icons are offering competitive lease payments and other costly incentives to make EV purchases compelling.

Hyundai Motor decided to push a $7,500 cash incentive on its 2025 Ioniq 5 for October, while also cutting the small crossover's price by nearly $10,000 for 2026. Similarly, Ford and GM's crosstown rival, Stellantis, began offering generous incentives to offset the loss of the federal tax credit immediately following its end. Those are just a handful of examples of how incentives are on the rise, but let's dig a little deeper as the issue spans the industry.

EV incentives peaked in July at 16% of average transaction prices (ATPs), according to Stephanie Valdez Streaty, Cox Automotive's director of industry insights, and at $8,900 during September the incentives remained above 15% of ATPs. That's more than twice the level for overall U.S. light vehicles that reached 7.4% in September, and still significantly above pre-pandemic levels that were typically around 10% of ATPs.

Unfortunately for automakers and investors alike, these profit-eroding incentives are a necessary evil due to the price gap between combustion engine vehicles and EVs. The average price for a new U.S. light vehicle was $47,962 in March 2025, according to Kelley Blue Book data cited by Experian, which remains near record highs. Meanwhile, the ATP for an EV in September reached $58,124, according to data from Cox.

What's the solution?

For automakers and investors, reducing these profit-killing incentives is important, and the arrival of truly affordable models is imperative. On that front, there's a bit of good news. One example is none other than General Motors' unveiling of the new Chevrolet Bolt.

The Chevy Bolt was released for the 2017 model year and was the automaker's first legitimate attempt at a modern EV. It was lauded as a great car in an ideal size and segment at a compelling price -- but due to an extended recall GM retired the vehicle in 2023 despite the Bolt posting its best sales year.

Now the Chevrolet Bolt is coming back in the early months of 2026 for round two.

The look and design of the two Bolts are very similar, especially viewing the exterior. The new Bolt offers about the same horsepower and will charge about three times faster than the previous generation. But the real kicker, especially for investors, is the price tag -- it ranges from $28,995 for the LT trim up to $32,000 for an RS trim, with an LT trim package between the two at $29,990. If you're keeping track, that makes the upcoming Bolt the cheapest EV announced across the U.S. market. The only problem is that currently the upcoming Bolt is allegedly only available for a limited time.

What it all means

While GM is preparing to launch the new Bolt at a compelling price point, the ever-changing EV industry dynamics aren't as pleasant for other automakers. That's true even for EV juggernaut Tesla, which has recently launched ""Standard"" and more affordable trims of its popular Model 3 and Model Y.

However, Tesla's strategy wasn't to start from the ground up for a truly compelling new affordable EV. Rather, the automaker opted to slash features and pinch pennies. All in all, Tesla was able to drop the Model Y Standard price down to $39,990 without shipping, about $5,000 less than the previous base price, and the Model 3 Standard down to $38,630, roughly $5,500 in savings. The problem is that due to the removal of features, the value proposition may not be compelling, and the lower-priced models could end up cannibalizing sales of more profitable trims and eroding margins themselves.

Further, for investors of pure-play EV makers such as Rivian and Lucid, the pain will be more drastic. These EV makers don't have a line of combustion engine vehicles to fall back on while the markets work through all the EV industry changes, policy rollbacks, and incentive spend.

The solution is as it's always been: produce a compelling EV at a comparable price to combustion engine counterparts. But the industry simply isn't quite there yet. Long-term investors would be wise to prepare for a few bumpy quarters and more hefty EV losses while incentives and high costs take a toll. The future is bright, but patience is required.

I've written recently about how all of these companies will lose a critical profit source in 2026. Automotive regulatory credits -- which previously brought in billions in ""free"" profit industrywide -- now have essentially zero value due to regulatory changes. But there's another challenge that Rivian, Lucid, and Tesla will soon face that could be even more damaging.

Demand for electric vehicles could be ""dreadful"" in 2026

According to research published in The New York Times, electric vehicle sales are expected to be ""dreadful"" next year. The demise won't wait until 2026 to begin, however. ""Sales of electric models are expected to plummet in the last three months of the year and then remain sluggish for some time,"" the article concludes.

The primary cause is clear: Earlier this year, the U.S. government eliminated tax credits for EV purchases. Because the tax credits expired at the end of September, many consumers raced to buy their vehicles before the deadline in order to lock in their financial incentives.

Previously, tax credits effectively reduced the cost of buying an EV by up to $7,500. A $55,000 vehicle, therefore, would essentially cost just $47,500. That's a big deal. Recent polling suggests that nearly 70% of American consumers want their next car to cost under $50,000.

When tax credits and other subsidies were reduced or eliminated in other countries, demand promptly fell off a cliff. That was the case for Germany in 2023, as well as Canada in 2025. Much of this demand slump will simply be due to a lumpy order book. Buyers who would have purchased in January 2026, for instance, may have accelerated their purchase to September 2025.

Investors should, therefore, be very skeptical about improving demand figures posted this upcoming quarter. The quarter that follows may, as the New York Times warns, generate ""dreadful"" sales growth rates.

Don't give up on Rivian, Tesla, or Lucid just yet

EV makers like Rivian, Tesla, and Lucid may have a rocky few quarters ahead. But that doesn't mean investors should ditch these stocks en masse. Long term, EV adoption is still expected to rise.

You may, however, want to conduct some asset reallocation based on this information. The company that will arguably be hit the least when it comes to eliminated tax credits for EV purchases is Tesla. It may see pressure on sales growth, but it has reliable access to capital. This will allow it to continue to invest in high-growth opportunities like robotaxis, as well as push to get a long-awaited $30,000 model to market. At that price point, these models will likely be cheap enough to see robust demand despite the absence of federal tax credits.

Rivian, meanwhile, is set to get its first affordable model to market: the R2. Two cheaper models -- the R3 and R3X -- are set to follow the R2, which is expected to begin production early next year. The R2 is expected to debut at $45,000. Even without incentives, that's below the $50,000 price point most buyers are targeting.

Lucid faces the most difficult road. The company has teased more affordable models for years, but the most aggressive timeline calls for production to begin by December 2026. Due to financial constraints and ancillary investment in other opportunities like robotaxis, it may take several more years to bring more affordable models to market. In a world where buyers are increasingly cost conscious, Lucid may struggle in a competitive landscape bereft of tax credits.

The future of the automotive industry is almost certainly electric vehicles.

With the removal of the $7,500 federal tax credit automakers are reaching into their own pockets for incentives.

EV incentives of ATPs were roughly twice the level of overall U.S. light vehicles.

10 stocks we like better than General Motors ›

On the one hand, the world is driving toward mass-adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) as they slowly but surely take over global roads. On the other hand, the U.S. is grappling with whipsaw effects from slower-than-anticipated adoption, the loss of the $7,500 federal tax credit for EV purchases, implementation of tariffs on import vehicles and auto parts, and the rollback of emissions and other environmental standards.

If you're an auto investor who doesn't look fondly upon those developments, just wait a few minutes and it'll probably change, for better or worse. Here's the latest issue facing investors and the EV industry.

Profit-eroding incentives

With the federal $7,500 tax credit ending with the month of September, automakers trying to move EV inventory are digging into their own pockets to drive demand. General Motors (NYSE: GM) and Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) had previously found an intriguing loophole to use their finance arms to place down payments on EVs with intentions to pass that along to the consumer later. But both quickly ended those programs after pressure from politicians claimed the workarounds were ""nefarious."" Now the two Detroit auto icons are offering competitive lease payments and other costly incentives to make EV purchases compelling.

Hyundai Motor decided to push a $7,500 cash incentive on its 2025 Ioniq 5 for October, while also cutting the small crossover's price by nearly $10,000 for 2026. Similarly, Ford and GM's crosstown rival, Stellantis, began offering generous incentives to offset the loss of the federal tax credit immediately following its end. Those are just a handful of examples of how incentives are on the rise, but let's dig a little deeper as the issue spans the industry.

EV incentives peaked in July at 16% of average transaction prices (ATPs), according to Stephanie Valdez Streaty, Cox Automotive's director of industry insights, and at $8,900 during September the incentives remained above 15% of ATPs. That's more than twice the level for overall U.S. light vehicles that reached 7.4% in September, and still significantly above pre-pandemic levels that were typically around 10% of ATPs.

Unfortunately for automakers and investors alike, these profit-eroding incentives are a necessary evil due to the price gap between combustion engine vehicles and EVs. The average price for a new U.S. light vehicle was $47,962 in March 2025, according to Kelley Blue Book data cited by Experian, which remains near record highs. Meanwhile, the ATP for an EV in September reached $58,124, according to data from Cox.

What's the solution?

For automakers and investors, reducing these profit-killing incentives is important, and the arrival of truly affordable models is imperative. On that front, there's a bit of good news. One example is none other than General Motors' unveiling of the new Chevrolet Bolt.

The Chevy Bolt was released for the 2017 model year and was the automaker's first legitimate attempt at a modern EV. It was lauded as a great car in an ideal size and segment at a compelling price -- but due to an extended recall GM retired the vehicle in 2023 despite the Bolt posting its best sales year.

Now the Chevrolet Bolt is coming back in the early months of 2026 for round two.

The look and design of the two Bolts are very similar, especially viewing the exterior. The new Bolt offers about the same horsepower and will charge about three times faster than the previous generation. But the real kicker, especially for investors, is the price tag -- it ranges from $28,995 for the LT trim up to $32,000 for an RS trim, with an LT trim package between the two at $29,990. If you're keeping track, that makes the upcoming Bolt the cheapest EV announced across the U.S. market. The only problem is that currently the upcoming Bolt is allegedly only available for a limited time.

What it all means

While GM is preparing to launch the new Bolt at a compelling price point, the ever-changing EV industry dynamics aren't as pleasant for other automakers. That's true even for EV juggernaut Tesla, which has recently launched ""Standard"" and more affordable trims of its popular Model 3 and Model Y.

However, Tesla's strategy wasn't to start from the ground up for a truly compelling new affordable EV. Rather, the automaker opted to slash features and pinch pennies. All in all, Tesla was able to drop the Model Y Standard price down to $39,990 without shipping, about $5,000 less than the previous base price, and the Model 3 Standard down to $38,630, roughly $5,500 in savings. The problem is that due to the removal of features, the value proposition may not be compelling, and the lower-priced models could end up cannibalizing sales of more profitable trims and eroding margins themselves.

Further, for investors of pure-play EV makers such as Rivian and Lucid, the pain will be more drastic. These EV makers don't have a line of combustion engine vehicles to fall back on while the markets work through all the EV industry changes, policy rollbacks, and incentive spend.

The solution is as it's always been: produce a compelling EV at a comparable price to combustion engine counterparts. But the industry simply isn't quite there yet. Long-term investors would be wise to prepare for a few bumpy quarters and more hefty EV losses while incentives and high costs take a toll. The future is bright, but patience is required.

For months, the US – which walked out of the April talks – put pressure on other countries to reject the move.
In the final tally, 57 countries voted favour of delay, with 49 countries against delaying, and 21 abstentions.

Shipping represents about 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions, but that is forecast to rise to 10% by mid-century.","Under intense pressure from Donald Trump’s government, countries have postponed plans to force shipowners to start paying for the damage they do to the climate.

US officials were accused of “bullying” and “intimidation”, as nations met in London for what should have been the rubber-stamping of a decision made months ago to place a small levy on the greenhouse gases from global shipping.

Instead, after four days of intense wrangling, the US efforts appeared to pay off in a decisive vote late on Friday afternoon at the International Maritime Organisation headquarters in London.

A majority of countries present voted to put the plans for an emissions pricing mechanism on hold for a year. While this means the measure survives, and could still be imposed, it also gives the US and its allies – including Russia, Saudi Arabia and other petrostates – an opportunity to step up their pressure on other countries to ditch the charge.

Arsenio Dominguez, the IMO secretary general, said the outcome was not a cause for celebration. Taking aim at the fractious nature of the discussions, he chided delegates: “It is the time to really look back at how we have approached this meeting. My plea to you is not to repeat the way we have approached this meeting for future discussions.”

The measure, which would mean shipowners pay a small charge on the CO2 produced by their vessels and have incentives to seek cleaner fuels and upgrade their ships, was passed in a majority vote in April. But under the complex rules of the world’s shipping regulator, that vote had to be reaffirmed at a further meeting this week.

For months, the US – which walked out of the April talks – put pressure on other countries to reject the move. In the past fortnight, this was stepped up to what some countries said amounted to an unprecedented campaign against them.

The US threatened countries, and individual officials, with tariffs, penalties and visa revocations if they supported the pricing mechanism.

Dr Simon Bullock, a research fellow at the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research at the University of Manchester, said: “Yet again, powerful fossil fuel states are successfully blocking global efforts to cooperate on climate change. This is not the result the industry wanted, nor one the world’s people can afford. Progressive shipping businesses and nations can still chart a course to a clean shipping future, but Mr Trump’s aggressive, destructive lobbying has their made their job much harder.”

Meanwhile, some petrostates including Saudi Arabia held out the offer of sweeteners to countries that voted against the plan, which has been several years in the making.

In the final tally, 57 countries voted favour of delay, with 49 countries against delaying, and 21 abstentions. In April, the measure had passed with the support of 63 member states and 16 countries against, though the US walked out and 24 countries abstained.

Ralph Regenvanu, Vanuatu’s climate minister, expressed the frustration of many small developing nations: “This is unacceptable given the urgency we face in light of accelerating climate change.”

After Friday’s vote, countries will have to reconvene in a year to consider the proposal again. The delay means uncertainty and confusion for companies involved in shipping and in the global trade in many key commodities.

John Maggs, of the Clean Shipping Coalition, said: “By delaying adoption of its net zero framework, the IMO has today squandered an important opportunity to tackle global shipping’s contribution to climate breakdown. With climate warming impacts being felt everywhere on earth, kicking this decision down the road is simply evading reality. Governments serious about climate action must spend the next 12 months rallying every nation that supports the framework, convincing those who are on the fence, or opposing, that its adoption is the only sane way forward.”

Even if the measure is agreed next year, it will take years to come into force, as IMO rules mean it must be subject to a further period of technical assessment and review of how it can be implemented. That could mean a delay until near the end of this decade, at least.

Experts estimate the carbon levy as planned could raise $10bn a year, but to the disappointment of many small countries most of any potential revenues would remain within the shipping industry. Much of the money would be used to help companies upgrade their vessels and move to lower carbon fuels, and pay for modifications to ports, rather than be allocated to poor countries to help them cope with the impacts of the climate crisis, as many had hoped.

If it is eventually passed, the measure is not likely to place significant costs on imported goods, despite the concerns of some exporting countries.

Shipping represents about 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions, but that is forecast to rise to 10% by mid-century. The IMO has been working on various plans to reduce carbon from shipping for the last two decades, but progress has been slow.

The extraordinary scenes at the IMO, where discussions are normally staid and highly technical, bodes ill for further talks on ways to raise the revenues needed for poor countries to deal with the impacts of extreme weather, which will be continued at the Cop30 UN climate summit in Brazil next month.

Anaïs Rios, senior shipping policy officer at the green campaigning organisation Seas at Risk, said: “Emotions have run high this week at the IMO, with once high-ambitious alliances wavering and strategies eclipsing reason. No single flag should dictate the world’s climate course. With countries like Saudi Arabia leading efforts to delay, few expected a postponement to prevail, but here we are. What matters now is that countries rise up and come back to the IMO with a louder and more confident yes vote that cannot be silenced. The planet does not have time to waste.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf90cc0d9c43a7420259c6ee8c74714f74e80733/457_0_4551_3640/master/4551.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0f3841056d8b21364e245225234d7a78",N,,2025-10-18 05:59:03.943342

Wright said tech companies operating large-scale data centers known as hyperscalers to power AI “really want to see nuclear happen,” and noted they’re investing in advancing nuclear technology.

He said the country is making rapid progress in nuclear fusion, although experts have said the technology will not solve energy problems until the end of the decade or in the early 2030’s.

President Donald Trump has signed executive orders this year intended to bring about a “nuclear renaissance,” and Wright used the same phrase Friday.

“Utah absolutely is going to be a key part of that,” he said.

Utah Republicans, including Gov. Spencer Cox, share the desire to develop nuclear technology in the state, passing legislation creating governing bodies to advance nuclear systems, appropriating $10 million to fund Cox’s nuclear energy regulations through Operation Gigawatt, and making deals with nuclear innovators.

Cox has said he envisions the state as a home to dozens of small modular reactors. In the last six months, the state has signed an agreement with a company owned by Bill Gates to explore a Utah site for a new nuclear reactor and announced a partnership with another firm to bring an advanced reactor to Emery County.

Asked if the Emery County project will get off the ground, Curtis told reporters at his conference Friday, “I don’t think we have a choice of it being a reality, the demands for energy are so high, we have to figure this out.

Carmen Valdez, senior policy associate with HEAL Utah, said she has concerns about possible radiation exposure in communities near nuclear facilities, along with the years that could lapse between public investment and the day a reactor’s up and running.

“We are a little concerned about hearing ‘making nuclear sexy again,’ because there’s a lot of not great things that come with that industry that are just being brushed aside,” Valdez said.

Wright emphasized the plan to raise the nation’s energy output includes keeping coal-fired power plants running.

“I’m also super excited about next-generation geothermal, and frankly, Utah is the leader in that,” he said, referencing an enhanced geothermal plant being built in Beaver County.

AES Indiana hopes regulators will finalize the case in the spring, so that it can implement new rates by June 1, 2026.
Correction: An earlier version of this article mistakenly described AES Indiana’s original base rate request as being for $293 million.","AES Indiana slashed its $193-million base rate increase request by more than half — to $91 million — in a settlement agreement filed with state regulators on Wednesday.

“We have a deep commitment to operating efficiently and keeping rates as low as possible,” utility President Brandi Davis-Handy said in a news release. “Throughout this process, we’ve listened to stakeholder feedback and evaluated tradeoffs we will make for future investments while minimizing the financial impact of delivering safe and reliable electric service.”

The proposed deal is with Indiana University and the city of Indianapolis, plus a variety of companies: Allison Transmission, Eli Lilly & Co., Rolls-Royce, Walmart and more. Kroger wasn’t part of the deal but has no objection to it, according to the filing.

The matter is before the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission, and won’t be decided until next year.

Indiana Utility Consumer Counselor Abby Gray and her office, as well as pro-ratepayer group Citizens Action Coalition, didn’t sign on.

“The settlement agreement filed by AES and other parties shows the utility’s initial request was inflated and unnecessary,” Gray said in a Thursday news release. “The OUCC stands by its initial recommendations for a reduction from current rates and will oppose the utility’s settlement agreement.”

State’s ratepayer advocate recommends denial of AES’ $200M proposed increase

Her office recommended last month that the IURC deny AES Indiana’s request — and, instead, said a $21 million cut to current rates is “warranted” based on the case‘s evidence and the law.

Citizens Action Coalition, meanwhile, called the proposal “unbalanced.”

“We will vigorously oppose this unfair and unaffordable deal and do everything we can to protect the residents of Indianapolis from yet another large utility bill increase,” Executive Director Kerwin Olson said in a Thursday news release. “Hoosiers have had enough with AES Indiana’s poor service, soaring bills, and backroom deals. It’s time for the IURC to send a message and restore affordability and accountability at our out-of-control monopoly utilities.”

The proposed settlement

AES Indiana provides retail electric service to more than 530,000 residential, commercial and industrial customers in Indianapolis, as well as portions of other central Indiana communities surrounding Marion County

The agreement would lower the revenue requirement AES Indiana seeks from $2.1 billion to $2 billion, and lists other changes — to the cost of capital, fuel oil inventory, depreciation, vegetation management and more — that go into the revenue figure.

The utility also agreed not to implement new base rates arising out of its next case until 2030, after the current base rate request is carried out.

And the company would delay the start of its next proposed transmission, distribution and storage improvement charge plan until 2028. The current plan enters its final year in 2026.

“For over a decade, AES Indiana has consistently ranked among the lowest residential rates in the state, and that’s not by chance,” Davis-Handy said. “Despite rising costs, we have been disciplined in our planning through measures like our operations and maintenance costs holding flat for the past five years.”

Some of the agreement’s terms affect specific parties, like streetlight provisions involving the city of Indianapolis or discussions about “ways to ameliorate the peaks associated with Rolls-Royce’s engine testing.”

Story continues below.

The document goes on to tackle the cost of service and rate design.

“The Settling Parties agree that rates should be designed in order to allocate the revenue requirement to and among AES Indiana’s customer classes in a fair and reasonable manner,” it reads.

The subsidy received by residential customers would be “mitigated” by 15%, according to the agreement. Fixed charges would stay at their current, regulator-approved levels: $12.50 monthly at 325 kilowatt hours or less, and $17 monthly for residents using more power.

Large secondary service customers would pay a $128 charge and a demand charge of $28.50.

Citizens Action Coalition said the deal would result in residential customers receiving a 6.51% base rate increase, whereas primary and secondary classes of large commercial and industrial customers would “only” receive a 3.19% and 4.12% increase, respectively.

The advocacy organization also critiqued the arrangement for “fail(ing) to adequately address” the “egregious and prolonged” problems tens of thousands of customers experienced after AES rolled out a new billing system in 2023.

Regulators can approve, deny, or modify any settlement agreement they consider. But the document says that — if the IURC doesn’t accept the proposed deal in its entirety — it’ll be null, void and withdrawn upon written notice of “unacceptable modifications” by any of the settling parties.

Data centers not part of the equation

AES Indiana also filed rebuttals this month to earlier criticisms.

In their response to the initial increase ask, OUCC witnesses labeled the utility “inattentive” and “indifferent” when it comes to affordability.

“While the OUCC may disagree with the Company on policy matters, the suggestion that differing viewpoints constitute wrongdoing should be rejected,” Davis-Handy said in her rebuttal.

She argued that AES Indiana can’t control much of the increase it seeks.

“Rate reviews are driven by facts and require sound analysis,” Davis-Handy said. “This is necessary because the price charged for retail electric service is underpinned by the cost incurred to provide the service, and the reality is that much of the cost incurred by the Company to provide service is outside the Company’s control.”

She pointed to the utility’s “relatively flat” non-fuel, non-labor operations and management expenses as proof of “reasonable and sound management of costs that are under the Company’s control.”

Davis-Handy also rejected claims that power-hungry data centers are behind the rate increase request, testifying that AES Indiana doesn’t have any data center customers right now and that data center load is “in no way associated with” the proposed hike.

The OUCC pledged to submit opposition testimony “on a future date to be determined.” The settlement agreement includes a request to change the case’s filing schedule, but notes the “non-settling parties” haven’t agreed to the revisions.

Parties will have the opportunity to file testimony in support or opposition to the deal, after which the IURC will hold an evidentiary hearing.

AES Indiana hopes regulators will finalize the case in the spring, so that it can implement new rates by June 1, 2026.

Correction: An earlier version of this article mistakenly described AES Indiana’s original base rate request as being for $293 million. However, it was for $193 million.",https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Screen-Shot-2023-08-01-at-12.44.47-PM.png,N,,2025-10-18 07:59:19.859662

Comprehensive Wrap-up: A Growth Story with Nuances In summary, Louisiana Pacific Corporation (NYSE: LPX) presents a compelling, albeit nuanced, growth story within the building materials industry.","Nashville, TN – As the North American housing market continues to navigate complex economic currents, investors are keenly assessing the long-term growth prospects of key players in the building materials sector. Among them, Louisiana Pacific Corporation (NYSE: LPX), a leading manufacturer of high-performance building materials and engineered wood products, stands at a critical juncture. With its stock currently trading around the low $90s as of mid-October 2025, the central question for many is whether LPX possesses the fundamental strength and market catalysts to double its share price within the next five years. This article delves into the company's current performance, strategic initiatives, market dynamics, and expert forecasts to provide a comprehensive outlook on its potential trajectory.

A Deep Dive into LPX's Growth Engine and Market Headwinds

Louisiana Pacific Corporation's business model is anchored by two primary segments: its highly successful Siding Solutions (including SmartSide and ExpertFinish products) and its Oriented Strand Board (OSB) offerings. As of October 2025, the company's strategy is heavily skewed towards capitalizing on the robust demand for its Siding products, which are lauded for their energy efficiency, weather resistance, and design flexibility. The anticipated above-market volume growth in the SmartSide business, fueled by successful new product developments and enhanced brand visibility, is a significant driver of LPX's positive long-term outlook. Notably, sales of its ExpertFinish products have demonstrated a strong 20% year-over-year growth, indicating expanding market share among repair and remodel contractors, further solidified by a strategic partnership with homebuilder Lennar. Improvements in pre-finishing efficiencies are also expected to bolster profitability within this segment.

Financially, LPX reported diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.99 for the Second Quarter of 2025, surpassing consensus estimates, despite a 7.2% year-over-year decline in quarterly revenue to $755 million. The divergence in segment performance is stark: Siding net sales surged by $45 million (11%) to $460 million, while OSB net sales plummeted by $101 million to $250 million. This trend is expected to continue into Q3 2025, with Siding net sales projected at $430 million (3% year-over-year growth) and a healthy Adjusted EBITDA of approximately $110 million. Conversely, the OSB segment is forecasted to record a negative Adjusted EBITDA of around $45 million, highlighting ongoing challenges in this commodity-driven business. For the full year 2025, LPX anticipates Siding net sales of approximately $1.7 billion (9% growth) with a robust 25% Adjusted EBITDA margin, while OSB is expected to remain in negative Adjusted EBITDA territory. The company plans significant capital expenditures of around $350 million for the year, signaling continued investment in its growth initiatives.

However, LPX's journey is not without considerable risks. Its substantial exposure to the cyclical North American housing market makes it vulnerable to economic downturns, which could lead to decreased demand and pricing pressure for its products. Volatility in energy and freight costs also poses a threat to earnings. Investor concerns are further compounded by competitor commentary hinting at potential volume declines due to inventory destocking, drawing parallels to the negative market performance observed in 2022 and 2023. As of mid-October 2025, LPX's stock has traded between $90.26 and $93.02, having delivered a -15.0% total return over the past 12 months. While short-term technical indicators show mixed signals, a ""Golden Star Signal"" issued in July 2025 on the long-term chart suggests potential for future gains. Insider sentiment is neutral, though hedge funds own a significant 94.73% of the stock, with recent purchases indicating increased institutional interest.

The Competitive Landscape: Winners and Losers in LPX's Shadow

The potential for Louisiana Pacific (NYSE: LPX) to achieve significant growth, possibly doubling its stock value, would undoubtedly send ripples through the competitive and interconnected building materials industry. LPX's primary competitors include giants like Weyerhaeuser (NYSE: WY), Boise Cascade (NYSE: BCC), West Fraser Timber (NYSE: WFG), and smaller specialized manufacturers.

If LPX's Siding Solutions continue their strong growth trajectory and gain substantial market share, competitors offering similar exterior building products could face increased pressure. Companies heavily invested in traditional siding materials or those without LPX's innovative product lineup might see their market positions erode. LPX's strategic partnership with Lennar, one of the nation's largest homebuilders, also gives it a competitive edge, potentially diverting business from other suppliers to Lennar and other homebuilders. Conversely, if LPX's OSB segment struggles to recover profitability, it might open opportunities for competitors like Weyerhaeuser and West Fraser Timber, which also have significant OSB operations, to gain market share or improve their margins in that specific product category.

Beyond direct competitors, related industries would also feel the effects. Homebuilders, for instance, could benefit from LPX's innovations, potentially leading to more cost-effective or aesthetically pleasing construction options, thereby enhancing their own offerings. Suppliers of raw materials to LPX could see increased demand, while those supplying competing manufacturers might experience stagnation. The entire ecosystem of contractors, distributors, and retailers dealing in building materials would need to adapt to LPX's market movements, potentially favoring its products if its growth continues. The dynamic interplay of product innovation, market share shifts, and raw material costs will dictate who ultimately wins or loses in the wake of LPX's future performance.

Broader Industry Trends and Historical Context

Louisiana Pacific's growth potential is inextricably linked to broader industry trends, particularly the health of the North American housing market. Factors such as housing starts, mortgage interest rates, and the availability of affordable housing significantly influence demand for building materials. As of October 2025, the market is grappling with fluctuating interest rates and persistent supply chain challenges, creating a complex environment for homebuilders and material suppliers alike. LPX's strong emphasis on its Siding Solutions, which cater to both new construction and the robust repair and remodel (R&R) market, positions it strategically to weather some of the volatility in new housing starts. The R&R segment tends to be more resilient during housing market slowdowns, offering a degree of insulation.

The push towards sustainable building practices and energy-efficient materials also plays directly into LPX's strengths. Products like SmartSide are often marketed with environmental benefits and durability, aligning with evolving consumer preferences and stricter building codes. This trend could create ripple effects, encouraging competitors to invest more in similar eco-friendly innovations or risk being left behind. Regulatory or policy changes related to forestry, carbon emissions, or construction standards could also significantly impact LPX and its peers. For instance, increased regulations on timber harvesting could drive up raw material costs, while incentives for green building could boost demand for LPX's specific product lines.

Historically, the building materials sector has been cyclical, closely mirroring economic cycles. Companies that have successfully navigated these cycles and achieved substantial long-term growth have often done so through strategic diversification, continuous innovation, and efficient cost management. The early 2000s saw a boom in housing, followed by a significant downturn, demonstrating the sector's sensitivity. Companies that emerged stronger focused on high-value products and operational resilience. LPX's current strategy of prioritizing its higher-margin Siding segment over the more commodity-driven OSB segment reflects an adaptation to these historical lessons, aiming to build a more stable and profitable business model less susceptible to the extreme swings of raw material prices.

What Comes Next: Navigating Opportunities and Challenges

Looking ahead, Louisiana Pacific (NYSE: LPX) faces a pivotal period that will determine its ability to achieve significant stock appreciation. In the short term, investors will be closely watching the company's Third Quarter 2025 earnings release on November 5, 2025. The performance of the Siding segment, particularly its ability to meet or exceed projected sales and Adjusted EBITDA, will be crucial. Any signs of stabilization or improvement in the OSB segment, even if it remains in negative EBITDA, could also be viewed positively. Beyond earnings, macroeconomic indicators such as housing starts, existing home sales, and interest rate decisions from the Federal Reserve will heavily influence market sentiment towards LPX and the broader building materials sector.

In the long term, LPX's strategic pivots will be key. Continued investment in research and development to expand its Siding Solutions product portfolio, coupled with aggressive market penetration strategies, will be essential. The partnership with Lennar is a strong foundation, but securing similar relationships with other major homebuilders could significantly accelerate growth. Operational efficiency improvements, particularly in pre-finishing processes for Siding, will be vital for margin expansion. Furthermore, exploring opportunities for international expansion or diversification into related, less cyclical building material niches could provide additional avenues for growth and risk mitigation. Potential strategic acquisitions that complement its Siding business or enhance its technological capabilities cannot be ruled out.

Several scenarios could unfold for LPX. In an optimistic scenario, a rebound in the North American housing market, coupled with sustained demand for its innovative Siding products and effective cost management, could propel the stock towards doubling its value within five years. Forecasts from Walletinvestor.com, predicting LPX to reach $149.695 by October 2030 (a 65.57% increase), and StockScan, forecasting an average price of $125.23 by 2030, suggest such a possibility, though the ""doubling"" target implies a more aggressive growth rate than these specific forecasts. A more conservative scenario might see steady but moderate growth, driven by the R&R market, but constrained by persistent housing market headwinds and OSB segment challenges. A pessimistic outlook would involve a prolonged housing downturn, significant increases in input costs, and a failure to effectively expand its Siding market share, leading to stagnation or decline.

Comprehensive Wrap-up: A Growth Story with Nuances

In summary, Louisiana Pacific Corporation (NYSE: LPX) presents a compelling, albeit nuanced, growth story within the building materials industry. The company's strategic focus on its high-growth, high-margin Siding Solutions business, particularly SmartSide and ExpertFinish, is a clear differentiator and the primary engine for future appreciation. Strong year-over-year growth in ExpertFinish sales, coupled with strategic partnerships and efficiency gains, underscore the segment's potential. However, the persistent drag from its commodity-driven OSB segment and the inherent cyclicality of the North American housing market remain significant headwinds that investors must carefully consider.

Moving forward, the market will closely scrutinize LPX's ability to continue expanding its Siding market share, innovate its product offerings, and manage operational costs effectively. While analyst sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with an average ""Hold"" rating and price targets suggesting a decent upside, achieving a doubling of the stock price within five years will require not only sustained execution on its Siding strategy but also a favorable macroeconomic environment, particularly a resilient or recovering housing sector. The substantial ownership by hedge funds indicates institutional confidence, but insider selling activity provides a mixed signal.

Investors should watch for upcoming earnings reports, paying close attention to Siding segment growth metrics and any signs of improvement or further deterioration in the OSB business. Furthermore, monitoring broader economic indicators such as housing starts, interest rate trends, and consumer spending on home improvements will provide critical context for LPX's performance. The company's capital allocation decisions, including share repurchases and investments in growth projects, will also be important indicators of management's confidence and strategic direction. While the path to doubling its stock value is challenging, LPX's strong position in the resilient Siding market provides a foundation for substantial long-term growth, making it a stock to watch in the coming months and years.

1. Resilience of the lambs: Some US solar projects are farming much more than sunlight – Factor This

Farmers across the US have different opinions on how we should use US farmland for solar. Some want panels on their land for financial benefits, others want to preserve their land or uphold family traditions. Some farmers are open to having solar panels on their land if they can still produce crops or livestock under the infrastructure.

For example, Enel North America announced a partnership with the Texas Solar Sheep Company last year to deploy more than 6,000 sheep across eight Texas solar projects in the largest known solar grazing agreement. The total Enel solar flock has now grown to 13,000.

2. How mega batteries are unlocking an energy revolution – The Financial Times

Across California, mega batteries store excess power from renewable sources and dispatch it when demand peaks. In August 2020, a heat wave pushed the state’s grid to its limits and triggered rolling blackouts over two days, cutting power to more than 800,000 homes for up to two and a half hours, raising serious questions about dependence on intermittent renewable energy. But this is what started the boom in mega battery development. California’s battery storage capacity has more than tripled to 13GW of power, with plans for an additional 8.6GW by 2027.

A standard 20-foot storage unit typically delivers 5-6MWh, enough to power around 30,000 UK homes for an hour.

3. Trump administration quietly canceled the nation’s largest solar project – CNN

Esmeralda 7, the collection of seven solar projects in Nevada, was supposed to generate up to 6.2 GW of energy, enough to power 2 million homes. But last week, BLM quietly changed the project’s status to “canceled.” The Interior Department said the change was part of a shift in permitting approach, not related to the government shutdown, and not a “cancellation,” per se.

Developers can still apply for approval through individual project proposals, but the environmental review process is slow, and each project could still be rejected later. The project was being moved through the permitting process under Biden, but some conservation groups and residents argued the arrays would impact critical desert wildlife habitat.

A two-year-old Texas-based power company, Base Power, is leasing huge batteries to homeowners that it can use for extra energy as needed. Its software fills the batteries when electricity is cheap and draws from them when prices rise, profiting from the difference and passing some savings back to customers.

Since launching, Base Power has sold over 100 MWh of battery capacity, enough to power 33,000 US homes for one hour. A major factor in Base Power’s growth is Texas’s deregulated energy market, which lets customers pick their power providers. The company also recently qualified for a state program that lets battery fleets combine their power and feed it back into the grid.

5. The real winners of Trump’s attack on clean energy aren’t American — The Washington Post

While the Trump administration works to revive fossil fuels and roll back clean energy support, global economics are accelerating a renewable surge led by China and India. Other nations are rapidly adopting solar, wind, and EVs because they’re cheaper and more reliable, with China dominating clean tech manufacturing. U.S. policy reversals have stalled investments and risk sidelining the country economically, while global forecasts show renewables scaling faster than energy demand, diminishing fossil fuels’ role.",https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/maxresdefault-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-18 11:03:08.296465

We are building data centers next to scenic, natural landscapes and in places people already call home.
If we lose that landscape to data centers, what will we have left?
But I have some questions before we build any more sites at the behest of big data, artificial intelligence and big business.
What environmental impact do these data centers have?","There is more than corn in Indiana. Now we are growing data centers. I don’t remember voting on this. No one asked my opinion before they started building these….so here it is.

There are already 72 large computing facilities in Indiana with more under construction or consideration. Indiana is turning valuable, irreplaceable farmland into sites for computer processing. We are building data centers next to scenic, natural landscapes and in places people already call home.

Our rural landscapes have always been part of the charm of living in Indiana. The farms, the small towns, the marshes and woodlands are what inspired T. C. Steele. If we lose that landscape to data centers, what will we have left? Are the environmental costs worth it just so Google can collect more data on me, Amazon can sell me more junk, and ChatGPT can do more thinking for me?

There are few issues that unite Hoosiers in these divided times. But maybe opposition to these new projects can bring us together. Whether you live in the city or on a farm, if you are Republican or Democrat, liberal or conservative, there doesn’t appear to be a lot of popular support for these new projects. In September, Google pulled the plug on a proposed data center in Franklin Township in Indianapolis—immediately before the Indianapolis City-County Council was going to vote on the project. The project was facing a united and stiff grassroots opposition from residents. The project would have permanently changed nearly 500 acres of farmland.

From what I’ve read, I do not want to live next to or near one of these big computing centers. They create light, noise, and air pollution. They use a tremendous amount of water and electricity. They drive down property values.

There are other drawbacks, too. Once completed, these facilities provide few permanent jobs. And some of those jobs are being replaced by robots and artificial intelligence. They also use an incredible amount of electricity. Our power infrastructure is already strained and in need of updating. I don’t know about you, but my electric bill is already high enough.

Maybe growing computer sites instead of corn is the wave of a new economic future. But I have some questions before we build any more sites at the behest of big data, artificial intelligence and big business. What environmental impact do these data centers have? How do they impact our health? Are they safe? How many jobs do they actually provide?

I am biased on this issue because I am from a farming family. The past of Indiana has been agriculture, and I think its future is also agriculture. We need to make sure that we have clean air, land and water to grow food. I don’t know if those in power are aware of this, but humans need food to survive. I also want an Indiana that is a healthy and safe place for us to live. We are the stewards of Indiana’s natural resources. That’s a role that our economic and political leaders need to take seriously. Once our natural resources are gone, once the landscape is destroyed, it’s just about impossible to bring back.

The vote was 167-19 in favor of the project, which will be funded thanks to New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) assistance.

Superintendent Dr. John O’Connor initially thought the project was “too good to be true”, but as the numbers lined up, the district moved forward with the proposal at no additional tax impact to district taxpayers. The cost of the project will be entirely covered thanks to a NYSERDA grant of $945,377, $100,000 in utility rebates, and roughly $6.4 million of New York State Building Aid.

The project consists of the installation of HVAC systems and mechanical upgrades throughout the district at a total cost of $7,466,977. New rooftop units will be installed at both schools to address heating, air conditioning, and air quality in classrooms, cafeterias, music rooms, and gymnasiums. Windows on the second and third floors of the Middle/High School will also be replaced to reduce energy loss, while electrical upgrades will improve efficiency, as well.

“This is an important step forward for our district as we continue to improve our facilities and energy efficiency,” O’Connor said.

The project received even more support than the initial capital project, which still passed by a sizable margin of 128-31. Between the two projects, the total amount of work surpasses $19 million, but no additional tax impact is required to fund the work.

“Stunned,” said Richard Herod III, who founded Car Guy Concierge to help people navigate buying and selling vehicles. “That news came after me realizing in the last 30 days, I’ve seen monumental shifts from carmakers to make cars more affordable.”

He pointed out a number of automakers are now offering low financing.

“You have import brands like Mitsubishi and Nissan offering zero percent APR and not just for three years, for five years, which is nuts,” said Herod. “Consumers can find a really good deal on a car when that hasn’t been the same for the last few years.”

He recommends car buyers ask about other discounts, including for service members, first responders and wholesale club members. According to Herod, it could save a buyer anywhere from $500 to $2,000, or more.

He also suggests analyzing potential tax savings while deciding whether to trade in an older vehicle or sell it on the marketplace.

“Trading the car in and saving the sales tax makes that worth doing rather than selling the car on their own,” said Herod. “If you can trade it and get a lower interest rate on a new car, you might end up with a payment that actually surprises you or makes you happy compared to a deal you could’ve gotten six months or 12 months ago.”

Owners who plan to trade in a vehicle should get familiar with its value on Kelley Blue Book and negotiate the trade-in offer.

These improvements to the grid are intended to facilitate electricity transmission in Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma, and West Virginia. The initiative, which focuses on lines managed by American Electric Power (AEP), will not create new routes but will enhance the capacity of existing ones.

AEP ranks among the largest utility companies and transmission line operators in the country, with a presence in 11 states. The 5,000 miles set for upgrades account for about 13% of its entire network.

The loan guarantee was put forward by the Biden administration just before President Trump took office. In the past, the Trump administration has pointed to approvals made between Election Day and Inauguration Day as reasons for halting certain projects.

It remains uncertain why this particular grid upgrade was treated differently from other projects that the Trump administration is reviewing for cancellation or has already moved to cancel.

In Minnesota, the Department of Energy is working to withdraw a $467 million grant that would have enabled 28 gigawatts of new generation capacity, primarily from solar and wind sources. Another project in Oregon involved $250 million in grants to link several renewable energy initiatives.

However, the most significant transmission project targeted for cancellation by the Trump administration is a $630 million grant to update California’s grid. Much like the AEP effort, this project aims to maximize the existing grid’s capacity to reduce congestion. The California plan includes testing advanced conductors and dynamic line rating technology, both designed to increase the amount of electricity that can be carried along established routes—a solution often less costly than constructing new lines.

AEP’s project will also involve installing new conductors on the lines. The loan guarantee will help the company obtain loans at a lower interest rate, which is expected to save at least $275 million—savings the company says will be passed on to its customers.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright stated that the loan will “help ensure lower electricity prices throughout the Midwest.” The states included in the project already have some of the lowest power rates in the country.

The loans will be provided by the Loan Programs Office, which the GOP has renamed the Energy Dominance Financing Program. This office was created under the 2005 Energy Policy Act and has traditionally supported clean energy and manufacturing ventures. Its loan default rate is about 3%, significantly lower than that of private lenders.",,N,,2025-10-18 16:04:05.485895

Canada has opportunities in the export of cleantech, such as renewable electricity, air pollution and monitoring equipment, biofuels, green hydrogen fuel and heat pumps, EDC says.
Some cleantech subsectors, such as renewable energy, are becoming increasingly profitable, and can continue to be even more economically competitive.","Canada has significant advantages in the export of renewable energy, electric vehicles (EVs) and electrification solutions — cleantech sectors that are “resilient to geopolitical headwinds,” according to Export Development Canada (EDC).

The EDC report identifies strengths such as Canada’s comparative advantages in clean electricity and renewable energy equipment, its potential to lead in the EV battery sector, and expertise in developing technologies that help transition an economy from being powered by fossil fuels to electricity.

There are challenges for the cleantech sector, including as upended global trade, disrupted supply chains and the U.S. retreat on climate action.

But it also gets a boost from “a huge demand for energy driven by AI (artificial intelligence) and regional energy security,” Prerna Sharma, a senior economist at EDC, told Sustainable Biz Canada. She is the author of the EDC report titled Canada’s cleantech future: Scalable, profitable, essential.

Another problem is that the majority of Canada’s environmental and cleantech exports go to the U.S. (77 per cent in 2023), which is complicated by the ongoing trade war with the country. However, there is “lots of room for growth” in markets outside the U.S., Sharma added, such as Europe, Asia and South America.

“I don’t think we fully realize our potential when it comes to our cleantech and environmental exports,” she said.

Canada’s cleantech export strengths

Renewable energy’s prospects are bright, EDC assesses in the report. With ever-growing demand for electricity to power data centres that provide the computing for AI, renewables will be a strong option to provide the energy. For example, the costs for installing solar energy infrastructure have continued to nosedive, making it 56 per cent cheaper than the average cost of fossil fuel-powered alternatives in 2023.

Canada has opportunities in the export of cleantech, such as renewable electricity, air pollution and monitoring equipment, biofuels, green hydrogen fuel and heat pumps, EDC says.

The Crown corporation mapped out the country’s comparative export advantages compared to its peers in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. For example, Canada has the edge in biofuels, green hydrogen and wind energy compared to the U.S. Against South Korea, Canada leads on solar and wind energy, and waste management and recycling.

On the EV side, Canada has the “capacity to become a global powerhouse in battery manufacturing” and exporter of critical minerals, Sharma said. Factors that will help Canada reach that potential are:

the country’s abundant reserves of critical minerals such as lithium, copper and graphite;

the billions of dollars invested into EV battery manufacturing in Ontario and Quebec;

access to clean electricity for low-carbon production; and

Canada’s strong sustainability standards for mining.

Canada can be a “global leader” in electrification, the EDC report states. Canadian companies are adopting and developing technologies that help an economy transition from being powered by fossil fuels to electricity, such as heat pumps and electric arc furnaces.

Plus, Canada is deeply familiar with renewable electricity and is deploying innovations to manage intermittency such as flexible switching.

The country has “a lot of capacity and capability to transfer this wealth and knowledge and good electrification standards we have,” Sharma said.

Cleantech sector is growing despite stressors

EDC notes three factors that are harming investor sentiment for cleantech: limited funding, policy shifts such as reduced government support in the U.S. and elevated tariffs, and investors looking toward more commercially viable technologies.

While mindful of the hurdles, Sharma said global momentum toward low-carbon technologies has not stopped. Approximately US$2 trillion was invested in clean energy in 2024, more than double the money that went to fossil fuels, she said. Some cleantech subsectors, such as renewable energy, are becoming increasingly profitable, and can continue to be even more economically competitive.

In addition to Canada’s advantages in cleantech exports, the country has specialties such as a highly educated workforce, a strong research and development base, a healthy startup scene, and a federal government committed to the energy transition, Sharma explained.

About Radiant Ridge Energy Radiant Ridge Energy is a North American energy infrastructure company specializing in hybrid power systems that deliver firm, contracted, reliable power for AI facilities and data centers.","-- Radiant Ridge Energy (RRE) today announced its entry into the Alberta energy market, delivering a solution to one of the most critical challenges facing AI and data center operators: access to firm, contracted, reliable power that can be deployed at the speed the digital economy demands.

The company is establishing its North American headquarters in Calgary and plans to begin operations with its first natural gas plant in 2026, marking the foundation of an ambitious expansion strategy targeting 450MW+ of operational capacity across Alberta by 2031.

The Firm Power Crisis: AI's Infrastructure Bottleneck

The explosive growth of AI infrastructure has exposed a fundamental gap in North America's energy landscape—one that threatens to constrain the entire AI revolution. Recent research from Goldman Sachs' 2025 report ""Powering the AI Era"" reveals the scale of the challenge: by 2030, global data center power demand is projected to surge 160%, yet aging electrical grids cannot adapt quickly enough to meet this demand.

""Goldman's research confirms what we're hearing from every AI company and data center operator we speak with,"" said Kevin Capozzi, VP Operations at Radiant Ridge Energy. ""Power has become the most urgent bottleneck in AI infrastructure development. A 250MW AI data center costs approximately $12 billion to build, but that investment is worthless without firm, reliable power to run it.""

The challenge has created what industry analysts are calling AI's ""Rust Belt"" revolution—a fundamental shift in how and where compute infrastructure gets built, driven entirely by access to firm power capacity.

Three Dimensions of the Power Problem

The firm power crisis facing AI infrastructure has three critical dimensions:

Renewable Intermittency: Wind and solar provide cost-effective generation but cannot guarantee firm capacity. Goldman Sachs projects that new data center power demand will require 30% natural gas combined cycle, 30% natural gas peaker plants, 27.5% solar, and 12.5% wind—a recognition that renewables alone cannot deliver the firm, reliable power compute operations demand.

Grid Constraints and Aging Infrastructure: The US electrical grid averages 40 years old and was never designed for AI-scale power density. By 2027, AI server rack power density will be 50 times that of cloud servers from just five years ago. Traditional utility connections require 5-7 years for approval and construction—unacceptable timelines when hyperscalers like Amazon and Google are investing $1 trillion in AI infrastructure by 2027, averaging $800 million in daily capital expenditure.

Reliability Requirements: AI training runs can't pause when the wind stops blowing. Data centers can't go dark when clouds cover solar panels. These operations need firm, contracted power with absolute reliability. Goldman's research shows global data center vacancy rates at just 3%—near 0% in hot markets—with no significant new power capacity expected before 2028, creating a severe supply-demand imbalance.

""A single power interruption can cost millions in lost compute time,"" Capozzi explained. ""One ChatGPT query consumes approximately 10 times the electricity of a Google search. When you're running massive GPU clusters for AI training, you need firm power with guaranteed availability—not estimates, not best-effort, not weather-dependent generation.""

The RRE Solution: Hybrid Systems for Firm, Contracted Power

Radiant Ridge Energy solves the firm power problem through intelligent hybrid integration that delivers contracted, reliable capacity at compute-grade standards—precisely the energy mix Goldman Sachs identifies as necessary for meeting AI infrastructure demand.

""Our approach directly addresses the acute short-term power contradictions Goldman describes,"" Capozzi explained. ""Natural gas plants take 5-7 years to build. Renewable energy supply is intermittent. Nuclear is a long-term solution. This creates severe near-term supply-demand tensions. Our hybrid-by-design model solves this by integrating wind, solar, and natural gas into systems that guarantee firm power delivery today, not five years from now.""

The company's hybrid architecture provides three critical advantages for the AI power crisis:

Guaranteed Firm Capacity: Unlike pure renewable projects that offer ""best effort"" generation, RRE delivers contracted firm power backed by dispatchable natural gas. Wind and solar provide cost-effective baseload generation while natural gas ensures firm capacity and rapid response during high-demand periods or renewable lulls. When customers sign a power purchase agreement with RRE, they receive guaranteed capacity—firm, reliable power when they need it, not just when weather conditions cooperate.

Rapid Deployment: RRE's modular approach uses standardized 10MW facilities that can scale to 100MW+ clusters. This standardization dramatically accelerates deployment timelines, delivering firm power in 12-18 months rather than the 5-7 years traditional utility grid connections require. With Goldman projecting a 10.4GW US data center demand-supply gap by 2030, speed to firm power is critical.

Behind-the-Meter Flexibility: Goldman's research highlights the rise of ""behind-the-meter power""—self-built microgrids and direct power plant connections that bypass grid bottlenecks. RRE's hybrid systems are designed for both grid-connected and behind-the-meter deployment, providing AI operators the flexibility to secure firm power regardless of grid constraints.

""We're not promising theoretical capacity or best-effort generation,"" said Capozzi. ""We're delivering firm, contracted, reliable power backed by operational guarantees. That's the difference between a renewable project and a compute-grade power solution that can actually support AI infrastructure development.""

Alberta Operations and Growth Strategy

RRE's Alberta roadmap focuses on rapid deployment of firm power capacity to address the immediate supply-demand gap:

2025-2026: Company establishment and first 10MW natural gas plant operational; submission of 50MW gas + 50MW hybrid project providing firm, contracted capacity

2026-2027: Ten small power plants delivering reliable power under long-term contracts with data center customers

2028-2029: First full hybrid station operational, firm power delivery at scale

2030-2031: Multiple hybrid stations providing contracted firm power across Alberta, positioning for U.S. market expansion

""Every megawatt we build is firm capacity under contract,"" Capozzi noted. ""We're not selling intermittent generation—we're delivering reliable power that compute operations can depend on, with deployment timelines that match the urgency of AI infrastructure investment.""

Powering the Compute Economy with Firm, Reliable Energy

Radiant Ridge Energy focuses exclusively on delivering firm, contracted power for compute infrastructure—the critical bottleneck Goldman Sachs identifies as constraining AI development:

AI Training Facilities: GPU clusters running multi-week training operations cannot tolerate power interruptions. With AI server rack power density reaching 50 times traditional cloud servers by 2027, these facilities require firm, reliable power with contracted capacity guarantees that enable uninterrupted AI development.

Data Centers: Whether hyperscale cloud providers investing $1 trillion by 2027 or colocation facilities serving emerging AI companies, data centers need firm power with guaranteed availability. RRE's contracted capacity model provides the reliable power foundation these operations demand, with scalability that grows alongside IT infrastructure without waiting years for grid upgrades.

""Goldman's research shows that compute infrastructure has become the defining infrastructure challenge of our time—similar to railroads, electrification, and the internet,"" Capozzi emphasized. ""But unlike those previous revolutions, AI can't wait decades for infrastructure buildout. Our customers need firm, contracted, reliable power now—not estimates, not best-effort, not weather-dependent generation. They need guaranteed capacity they can build their business on. That's what we deliver.""

Why Alberta for Firm Power Development

Alberta's unique combination of resources positions it as an ideal solution to North America's AI power crisis:

""Alberta has world-class wind and solar resources, established natural gas infrastructure, and transmission capability to support hybrid integration,"" Capozzi explained. ""While Goldman's research shows the US facing a 10.4GW demand-supply gap by 2030, Alberta's competitive, market-driven energy sector rewards innovation in firm power delivery. We can build, contract, and deliver reliable power faster here than anywhere else in North America.""

The province's growing tech sector, strategic location, and business-friendly regulatory environment also position Alberta as a natural hub for AI infrastructure requiring firm, contracted power—offering an alternative to power-constrained markets in the US and overseas.

Partnership-Focused Approach

RRE offers multiple collaboration pathways centered on firm power delivery, aligned with the innovative financing models Goldman Sachs identifies as necessary for AI infrastructure development:

Power Purchase Agreements: Long-term contracts guaranteeing firm capacity with fixed pricing and reliable delivery, providing the contracted power security hyperscalers and AI companies require

Joint Development: Co-develop hybrid projects delivering contracted firm power for specific facilities or strategic locations, leveraging customer land holdings or grid connections

Strategic Investment: Equity partnerships providing access to firm power capacity and project economics, addressing Goldman's observation that traditional financing models are failing and innovative approaches are required

Supply Chain Partnerships: Standardized procurement supporting rapid deployment of reliable power infrastructure

""Goldman's research shows that by 2030, digital infrastructure will require $2 trillion in capital globally,"" said Capozzi. ""Every partnership we build is about delivering firm, contracted, reliable power that makes those investments productive. That's our singular focus and our competitive advantage.""

Proven Capability in Critical Infrastructure

While new to Alberta, Radiant Ridge Energy brings proven experience in mission-critical power systems, including a comprehensive national power system modernization initiative in Seychelles demonstrating the company's capability to deliver reliable power at scale.

""We understand what reliable power means,"" Capozzi said. ""Now we're bringing that operational excellence to Alberta's compute sector with firm, contracted capacity they can depend on—solving the most urgent bottleneck facing AI development today.""

Note: Because of the federal government shutdown that started on Oct. 1, 2025, government-provided estimates for the employment situation, inflation, wages, and other statistics were unavailable for this report. These values will be provided again once the data becomes available. Wherever possible, privately-provided estimates will be monitored instead.

Although the federal government shutdown prevented the release of key economic data, the available statistics pointed to mixed implications for the U.S. economy. The August Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey showed that hiring and job separations both declined by nearly the same amount, keeping job growth implied by the survey slightly positive. The September ADP jobs report, which gained importance in lieu of government-provided estimates, showed a decline of 32,000 private sector jobs. While this indicates a continued decline in jobs growth, it lacks perspective on broad labor market conditions without a read of the unemployment rate.

The government shutdown itself contributes to near-term risk of macroeconomic deceleration that expands with the duration of the shutdown. Moreover, the end of the federal deferred resignation period on Sept. 30, coupled with any additional layoffs in the federal government, could contribute to a jump in the unemployment rate and a corresponding decline in economic activity. Despite these downside factors, several indicators point to a macroeconomic improvement in the coming months. In particular, business survey data shows an improvement in the hiring outlook, which could cause the employment situation and economic activity to rebound.

In response to weakening labor markets, the Federal Reserve reduced its key short-term interest rate by 25 basis points during its September meeting. While this rate reduction was widely anticipated, further rate cuts remain uncertain. In reducing rates in September, the Fed prioritized labor market concerns over persistent inflation, which remains nearly a percentage point above the Fed’s 2 percent target. Mortgage rates and the 10-year Treasury yield both fell in September as borrowing costs fell across capital markets.

Stories We’re Following

Long-term Treasury Yields

The issue: Activity in the long-term Treasury security market offers insights into movements in mortgage rates. While short-term rates are affected by certain factors, including Fed interest rate changes, long-term rates are affected by the long-term macroeconomic outlook, the inflation outlook, and credit risk over the investment horizon. By studying the changes in long-term rates, along with the factors affecting long-term rates, we can understand how those individual factors might impact mortgage rates and other long-term rates.

Updates: Over the past few years, the spread between the 10-year and 30-year Treasury yields has been roughly 10-20 basis points. However, since April of 2025, the spread between these securities has risen sharply, nearly reaching 70 basis points in early September. Differences in inflation expectations implied by the inflation-protected Treasury securities do not account for this difference, leaving other factors, like credit risk, the long-term economic outlook, and other market forces to explain this increase.1 If federal credit risk is driving this increase in the yield spread, then this rise in credit risk is unlikely affecting mortgage rates because of the 10-year Treasury yield’s prominence as the benchmark for mortgage rates.

Federal Reserve Policy

The issue: The Fed is tasked with achieving a dual mandate of price stability and full employment. As inflation approaches the Fed’s 2 percent target, the central bank gains support for reducing interest rates to accommodate slowing labor markets. As part of its broader balance sheet operations, the Fed also buys and sells long-term private and public financial assets. Its divestment in mortgage-backed securities has placed upward pressure on mortgage rates, which could continue for as long as the Fed maintains this policy.

Updates: The Fed reduced its target short term rate by 25 basis points in response to a weakening U.S. labor market. Fed Chair Jerome Powell characterized the rate reduction as a risk management exercise, as the possibility of further deterioration in labor markets outweighs the upside risks to inflation. Meanwhile, the Fed left its balance sheet policy unchanged, which could sustain elevated long-term interest rates, relative to short-term interest rates.

Recession Likelihood

The issue: The onset of the global trade war and recent deceleration of the U.S. labor market created concerns that the economy may be entering into a recession. Recessions are broad declines in economic activity typically characterized by a decline in economic growth and a rise in unemployment. They are often triggered by a shock to the economy, such as the global financial crisis in 2008 and 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Understanding the state of the economy and the nature of economic downturns provides insights into the near-term likelihood of recessions.

Updates: Although recessions can happen at any time, trends in the durations of economic expansions remain one of the best broad-based measures of recession likelihood. At 5.5 years, the current expansion’s duration would be short, relative to the trending increase in durations over time. A recession now would make the current expansion the shortest in over four decades. Moreover, although the unemployment rate has been slowly rising, economic growth remains elevated, contradicting the pattern typically seen during a recession. These factors show no clear indication that a recession is likely to happen in the coming months, although it’s certainly possible.

Notes: Expansions are measured from the end date of one recession to the start date of the next recession. The current expansion, which started in May 2020 (shown in green), is still ongoing.

Texas Economic Indicators

Although the availability of employment data was affected by the federal government shutdown, recent downward revisions to Texas employment show that the state-level economy may be operating at a rate closer to the national-level growth rate than previous estimates indicated. Survey data from the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas showed continued growth in the share of Texas retail and service sector firms expecting to increase employment. The hiring outlook in the Texas manufacturing sector, however, deteriorated, likely due to the decline in oil prices.

Employment Outlook

The share of Texas firms planning to hire in the next six months continued a strong rebound in the services and retail sectors, while declining in the manufacturing sector (Figure 6). This indicates a broad rebound in business optimism that could lead to a corresponding increase in job growth in the coming months. The number of firms planning to decrease employment rose sharply in the manufacturing sector, while ticking down in the retail sector and remaining mostly flat in the services sector. Overall, the business survey data appears to indicate a labor market improvement in the coming months in the services and retail sectors and a worsening labor market in manufacturing. This employment outlook survey remains a critical indicator of the labor market and economic trajectory.

Housing and Mortgage Rates

Mortgage rates continued falling in September but remained elevated, as rates declined 26 basis points from 6.56 percent to 6.30 percent (Figure 7). Broad-based housing cost measures across the U.S. continued showing deceleration in the housing market, as heightened mortgage rates and a sustained macroeconomic deceleration continue weighing on housing market activity.

As the Federal Reserve pivots to more accommodative policy in the coming months, short-term rates may continue to decline. Long-term rates on certain financial assets, including mortgages, may depend extensively on several factors, including the inflation outlook, the U.S. macroeconomic outlook, and the Fed’s balance sheet policy.

The mortgage spread (Figure 8)—defined as the premium of mortgage rates over the 10-year Treasury yield—continued to decline, falling 17 basis points in September, from 231 to 214 basis points (i.e., from 2.31 percentage points to 2.14 percentage points). The mortgage spread, which provides useful context of mortgage rates in broader capital markets, remains elevated compared to the historical range of 150-175 basis points. This suggests that as capital markets normalize, mortgage rates could decline by another 50 to 75 basis points, relative to the 10-year Treasury yield.

Notes: The mortgage spread is defined as the 30-year mortgage rate minus 10-year Treasury yield. Its typical range is 1.5 percent to 1.75 percent (150 to 175 basis points).

“We do not think India can stop Russian crude purchases overnight, even if it has agreed to do so, as at least 700,000 bpd of India imports of Russian crude are on a term basis,” consultancy FGE said in a note.
China could pick up some of the volumes backed out of India as Russian crude discounts will widen further, they added.
“The move has undoubtedly sounded an alarm for other Russian oil buyers who may have previously overlooked sanctions from non-U.S. authorities,” Xu said.
Anne-Sophie Corbeau, a researcher at Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy, said the U.S. needs to have a consistent and coherent policy on Russian LNG.","The moves come after Russia ramped up crude exports this month as Ukrainian drone attacks on its refineries have reduced oil processing. China and India’s seaborne imports of key Russian crude grades are expected to rebound to about 3.1 million barrels per day in October, the highest volume since June, data from analytics firm Kpler showed.

These imports are expected to remain high through November given the sharp rise in exports from Russia, Kpler’s senior oil analyst Muyu Xu said.

“However, the sudden UK sanctions on Chinese and Indian refineries — and the possibility of more measures from the EU or even the U.S. — could prompt buyers to take a more cautious approach when placing new orders until further clarification emerges,” she added.

INDIA CUTS NOT YET VISIBLE

A White House official said on Thursday that Indian refiners are already cutting Russian oil imports by 50%. Indian sources said the cut was not visible yet, though it could be reflected in import numbers for December or January. Refiners had already placed orders for November loading that included some cargoes for December arrival as well, multiple sources said.

“We do not think India can stop Russian crude purchases overnight, even if it has agreed to do so, as at least 700,000 bpd of India imports of Russian crude are on a term basis,” consultancy FGE said in a note.

“Therefore, the maximum volume of Russian crude flows to India we see as potentially being at risk in the short term is the 0.8-1 million bpd of spot volumes that Indian refiners take,” FGE analysts said. China could pick up some of the volumes backed out of India as Russian crude discounts will widen further, they added.

Meanwhile, Indian refiners have bought rare Guyanese crude as they diversify purchases that would mitigate the impact on their operations if Russian supply was cut.

SANCTIONS ON NAYARA, YULONG

Britain slapped sanctions on India’s Nayara refinery, which is already reeling from EU sanctions, and on Chinese refiner Yulong Petrochemical which operates a 400,000 barrels per day refinery in China’s eastern Shandong province.

The UK government has given Yulong until November 13 to complete outstanding transactions, allowing the refiner to handle its upcoming Middle Eastern imports, Kpler’s Xu said.

It’s unclear if Yulong can establish a new supply chain to circumvent the sanctions, she added.

“The move has undoubtedly sounded an alarm for other Russian oil buyers who may have previously overlooked sanctions from non-U.S. authorities,” Xu said.

June Goh, a senior oil market analyst at Sparta Commodities, said the UK sanctions are unlikely to significantly impact Yulong, but the refiner will find it hard to maintain operations if the EU and the U.S. follow suit.

Meanwhile, Taiwan’s Russian naphtha imports are set to fall after a group of non-governmental organisations criticised the island’s continued business with Russia.

However, Ukrainian attacks on Russian energy infrastructure, as well as a partial ban imposed by Moscow on Russian exports of gasoline and diesel, have already been capping Russian refined product shipments, traders said.

JAPAN LNG IMPORTS

The U.S. has also called on Japan to halt Russian energy imports, ahead of U.S. President Donald Trump’s expected visit to Asia later this month.

Tokyo has agreed with other G7 countries to phase out Russian oil imports in response to Moscow’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, but it has exemptions to continue importing LNG from the Sakhalin-2 project under long-term contracts.

An early termination of these contracts would result in various penalties, said Yuriy Humber, CEO of Tokyo-based consultancy Yuri Group. Also, securing an additional 6 million metric tons of LNG annually on the spot market to replace Russian supply would not be easy and is “massively expensive”, he said.

Russian LNG, which accounts for about 9% of Japanese imports, is an important stable supply source for Japan, Kingo Hayashi, chairman of Japan’s Federation of Electric Power Companies, told reporters on Friday, adding that Japanese utilities want to continue using it.

Anne-Sophie Corbeau, a researcher at Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy, said the U.S. needs to have a consistent and coherent policy on Russian LNG.

“On the one side, they are pressuring their allies to stop importing Russian gas or LNG. But they are not implementing their own sanctions on Arctic LNG 2,” she said, referring to Russia’s large-scale LNG project in northern Siberia which is still delivering LNG to China despite being under U.S. sanctions.

John Curtis believes his colleagues are not too far apart to approve his bipartisan-backed plan changing up wildfire management.

“I think the odds are very, very high,” Curtis, a Republican, told reporters Friday when asked about the chances of the fire proposal reaching final passage.

The bill was a focus of Curtis’ annual Conservative Climate Summit. The Friday event came just three weeks after President Donald Trump called climate change a “con job” at the United Nations and as the administration plans to keep coal-fired power plants running to meet energy demands.

Curtis said he does not agree with the “demonization of fossil fuels” and believes the nation’s energy demands require multiple types of generation.

Asked about the cancellation of $7.5 billion in clean energy projects, Curtis said, “I have concerns.”

He said he’s not familiar with each project, “but I’ll come back to this: We need every electron we can get.”

Over a video feed on Friday, U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright also addressed the canceled projects in a speech to attendees of the climate summit.

“A lot of the stopping of funding of projects we’re working on right now have really been mutual decisions with the original applicants for them, that I think were counting on government support to continue on, you know, subsidized purchases of things that didn’t, that wouldn’t exist without subsidies,” Wright said. “We need things that will fly on their own.”

The National Resources Defense Council has said the projects were “crucial” for manufacturing and grid upgrades, and ending support for them will stall American innovation and competitiveness, raising costs for consumers, and further cementing our reliance on dirty fossil fuels.”

Some Republicans in Congress have shifted away from focusing on climate change, but Curtis said he’s still winning over support from those in his party who attend the yearly event.

“Some of them come, and they fold their arms like that, and they’re very suspicious. And then by the end of the day, they go, ‘I get it’,’” he said, “and they realize that it’s been a mistake for Republicans to not be engaged, because we do, we care deeply about the Earth.”

Curtis is sponsoring the bipartisan fire legislation along with Sens. Alex Padilla of California and John Hickenlooper of Colorado, both Democrats, and fellow Republican Tim Sheehy of Montana.

The wide-ranging bill would set up a Wildfire Intelligence Center, require evaluations of fireshed areas, and boost forest restoration funds, among other changes. Several environmental groups oppose the measure, saying it would open millions of acres of federal land to logging without allowing for scientific review or community input first.

In its fourth year, the event brought together representatives from the energy industry, government and environmental groups, with conversations focused on emerging technology,

Nuclear is going to become sexy again” Wright said, speaking by a video feed at Utah Sen. John Curtis’ Conservative Climate Summit in Salt Lake City.
Wright said tech companies operating large-scale data centers known as hyperscalers to power AI “really want to see nuclear happen,” and noted they’re investing in advancing nuclear technology.
With nuclear projects coming to Utah, Cox hopes for rural jobs, but that’s no easy task Utah Republicans, including Gov.

“We’re really going to see nuclear move again. Nuclear is going to become sexy again” Wright said, speaking by a video feed at Utah Sen. John Curtis’ Conservative Climate Summit in Salt Lake City.

Wright said tech companies operating large-scale data centers known as hyperscalers to power AI “really want to see nuclear happen,” and noted they’re investing in advancing nuclear technology.

He said the country is making rapid progress in nuclear fusion, although experts have said the technology will not solve energy problems until the end of the decade or in the early 2030’s.

President Donald Trump has signed executive orders this year intended to bring about a “nuclear renaissance,” and Wright used the same phrase Friday.

“Utah absolutely is going to be a key part of that,” he said.

With nuclear projects coming to Utah, Cox hopes for rural jobs, but that’s no easy task

Utah Republicans, including Gov. Spencer Cox, share the desire to develop nuclear technology in the state, passing legislation creating governing bodies to advance nuclear systems, appropriating $10 million to fund Cox’s nuclear energy regulations through Operation Gigawatt, and making deals with nuclear innovators.

Cox has said he envisions the state as a home to dozens of small modular reactors. In the last six months, the state has signed an agreement with a company owned by Bill Gates to explore a Utah site for a new nuclear reactor and announced a partnership with another firm to bring an advanced reactor to Emery County.

Asked if the Emery County project will get off the ground, Curtis told reporters at his conference Friday, “I don’t think we have a choice of it being a reality, the demands for energy are so high, we have to figure this out.

Carmen Valdez, senior policy associate with HEAL Utah, said she has concerns about possible radiation exposure in communities near nuclear facilities, along with the years that could lapse between public investment and the day a reactor’s up and running.

“We are a little concerned about hearing ‘making nuclear sexy again,’ because there’s a lot of not great things that come with that industry that are just being brushed aside,” Valdez said.

Wright emphasized the plan to raise the nation’s energy output includes keeping coal-fired power plants running.

“I’m also super excited about next-generation geothermal, and frankly, Utah is the leader in that,” he said, referencing an enhanced geothermal plant being built in Beaver County.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-47642/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/wright.ames-8.14.1-2048x1536-1-1024x7681760750369.jpg?h=ddb1ad0c&itok=f8CjlLos,N,,2025-10-17 23:05:48.997229

The collaboration, called the Mountain State Plugging Fund, will see Diversified invest $70 million toward plugging its non-producing wells across the state over the next 20 years.
“We know that these abandoned wells can pose a significant risk to our environment and to our people.
Oil and natural gas wells are considered to be abandoned in West Virginia if they are idle for 12 months or more.
State money covered plugging 18 abandoned wells in 2023 and about 32 in 2024, per the DEP.","The state of West Virginia is entering into a “first of its kind” public-private partnership with Diversified Energy to ensure oil and natural gas wells owned by the company are properly retired.

The collaboration, called the Mountain State Plugging Fund, will see Diversified invest $70 million toward plugging its non-producing wells across the state over the next 20 years. That $70 million will be put into a fund held by OneNexus, an “insurance provider of financial assurance for asset retirement obligations,” per a news release. The state of West Virginia will be designated as a third-party beneficiary for the fund.

Gov. Patrick Morrisey said the collaboration and the creation of this fund could help set a “new national standard for how energy producing states can lead with both strength and responsibility.”

“We must be responsible stewards of the state’s environment. Historically, in West Virginia and across the country, it’s been a challenge to retire abandoned and orphaned gas wells in a responsible manner,” Morrisey said. “We know that these abandoned wells can pose a significant risk to our environment and to our people. Most of the time in the past, people would look to the taxpayers to bear that cost [of plugging them]. Well today we’re going to change that direction.”

Diversified expects to see at least 1,500 of its wells retired over the next 20 years through the investment, according to Diversified Energy CEO Rusty Hutson, Jr. By 2046, the company plans to increase its plugging capacity to 250 wells annually.

As part of the collaboration, Hutson said Diversified will “bolster” its resources for Next LVL Energy, a Diversified subsidiary located in Bridgeport. Morrisey said the investment will create between 50 and 100 new jobs with an average salary of $75,000 plus benefits.

Hutson said Diversified would like to see other oil and natural gas companies join the effort to plug wells responsibly when they’re taken offline.

Department of Environmental Protection Secretary Harold Ward said earlier this year that there are more than 21,000 abandoned and orphaned wells in the state of West Virginia that can pose varying levels of environmental or health risks for the people and communities near them.

Those risks include oil and gas leaks, methane emissions and groundwater contamination that can impact drinking water, among other things.

Oil and natural gas wells are considered to be abandoned in West Virginia if they are idle for 12 months or more. If there is no known operator for the wells — thousands have been created over the last 150 years — then they are considered orphaned. It is the state’s responsibility to remediate these wells.

According to the abandoned well mapping tool from the DEP, the cost of plugging each well varies, but generally comes in near or above $100,000.

A majority of wells plugged in the state are paid for using federal dollars allocated over recent years, specifically through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act in 2021 and the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022. Per the DEP, both of those federal programs — passed and allocated under former President Joe Biden — are a “significant boon” for the state’s attempts to identify and plug abandoned wells as they provide “substantial” funding to West Virginia that is “crucial” to supporting the state Office of Oil and Gas.

State funds — allocated to the OOG through industry permit fees, bond forfeitures and severance taxes — also go toward plugging wells, but existing bond rates are too low to cover the costs, leaving the remaining fees on taxpayers.

State money covered plugging 18 abandoned wells in 2023 and about 32 in 2024, per the DEP.

Meanwhile, federal funds covered plugging more than 200 abandoned or orphaned wells in 2023 and 2024 respectively. If the federal funding from the IIJA remains active and available, it’s estimated that the state will be able to plug at least 1,200 abandoned wells through 2030.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-47659/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/abandoned-oil-well-gettyimages-162984329-1024x6801760695688.jpg?h=50844e28&itok=tUsxB4Wl,N,,2025-10-18 07:00:08.557260

John Curtis believes his colleagues are not too far apart to approve his bipartisan-backed plan changing up wildfire management.

“I think the odds are very, very high,” Curtis, a Republican, told reporters Friday when asked about the chances of the fire proposal reaching final passage.

The bill was a focus of Curtis’ annual Conservative Climate Summit. The Friday event came just three weeks after President Donald Trump called climate change a “con job” at the United Nations and as the administration plans to keep coal-fired power plants running to meet energy demands.

Curtis said he does not agree with the “demonization of fossil fuels” and believes the nation’s energy demands require multiple types of generation.

Asked about the cancellation of $7.5 billion in clean energy projects, Curtis said, “I have concerns.”

He said he’s not familiar with each project, “but I’ll come back to this: We need every electron we can get.”

Over a video feed on Friday, U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright also addressed the canceled projects in a speech to attendees of the climate summit.

“A lot of the stopping of funding of projects we’re working on right now have really been mutual decisions with the original applicants for them, that I think were counting on government support to continue on, you know, subsidized purchases of things that didn’t, that wouldn’t exist without subsidies,” Wright said. “We need things that will fly on their own.”

The National Resources Defense Council has said the projects were “crucial” for manufacturing and grid upgrades, and ending support for them will stall American innovation and competitiveness, raising costs for consumers, and further cementing our reliance on dirty fossil fuels.”

Some Republicans in Congress have shifted away from focusing on climate change, but Curtis said he’s still winning over support from those in his party who attend the yearly event.

“Some of them come, and they fold their arms like that, and they’re very suspicious. And then by the end of the day, they go, ‘I get it’,’” he said, “and they realize that it’s been a mistake for Republicans to not be engaged, because we do, we care deeply about the Earth.”

Curtis is sponsoring the bipartisan fire legislation along with Sens. Alex Padilla of California and John Hickenlooper of Colorado, both Democrats, and fellow Republican Tim Sheehy of Montana.

The wide-ranging bill would set up a Wildfire Intelligence Center, require evaluations of fireshed areas, and boost forest restoration funds, among other changes. Several environmental groups oppose the measure, saying it would open millions of acres of federal land to logging without allowing for scientific review or community input first.

In its fourth year, the event brought together representatives from the energy industry, government and environmental groups, with conversations focused on emerging technology,

the permitting process, employing local workers in new projects, and finding ways for industry and government to work together. Curtis said attendance topped 600.

IS: So the EPA actually canceled quite a few grants meant for Alaska Native villages and various Alaska communities that were related to the impacts of climate change.
(Bill) Walker was in office, he created a climate change commission, which again recommended preparing for potential flooding, like what we saw now.
Dunleavy disbanded that commission, and he really hasn't taken on sort of a similar flagship effort to try to address climate change.
Dunleavy this week about whether or not the impacts from the storm were related to climate change.","In the wake of the storm that devastated western Alaska this week, there's been scrutiny of the Trump administration's cancellation of a grant that had been aimed at preventing erosion in one of the hardest hit communities.

Under former President Joe Biden, the Environmental Protection Agency awarded the $20 million grant to the village of Kipnuk in December. But after Trump took office, his EPA canceled the grant, along with millions more meant for climate change mitigation and renewable energy projects.

As the Anchorage Daily News reports, the EPA defended that decision this week.

And while there are questions about whether the grant would've done much to help Kipnuk from the storm that hit Sunday, ADN reporter Iris Samuels says it was supposed to be used to build a protective barrier.

This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.

Iris Samuels: So the village used to be several hundred feet away from the banks of the river, and over time it's gotten closer and closer and closer. So the goal of this grant was to create an erosion barrier, so that homes and village infrastructure that were at risk from the river eroding would be protected. That was the goal of the grant.

Casey Grove: Gotcha. So my understanding is it was canceled earlier this year. How was it canceled? And I guess, also, why was it canceled? Do we know?

IS: So the grant was awarded in December of 2024, and then Trump was elected, President Trump was elected. And in about March, this grant was frozen, and the EPA administrator basically said that they were reviewing all these grants that had to do with what they refer to as ""climate justice,"" and that potentially some of this funding would be reinstated after it went through this review process. But then in May the grant was formally canceled.

CG: And then, of course, this storm hits Kipnuk, Kwigillingok, other communities have been hit really hard by that, obviously. And folks started looking at this grant and the cancelation of this grant. You reached out to the EPA asking about that. What did they say?

IS: Right. So right from the very beginning, there was this awareness that there was, had been, this grant that was canceled. And we actually heard from Sen. Lisa Murkowski saying, essentially, something along the lines of, and this was back on Monday, really, the day after the storm had hit, that while this grant itself wouldn't have actually saved the damage that was inflicted on Kipnuk by this storm, because the construction wouldn't have been completed in time, what this storm really shows is the importance, broadly speaking, of this grant and grants like it, in protecting these types of communities.

So then I reached out to the EPA, and basically they said, ""It's a very good thing that we canceled this grant, because if we hadn't, then construction would have begun, and all the funding that had been awarded would be swept away in the Kuskokwim River,"" is what they said. So all we have is the written statement that the EPA provided from a spokesperson, so we kind of have to do some parsing of our own, but I think for the people of this community, this statement can come across as in a very, sort of, hurtful way, because reading between the lines, it essentially says, ""If there is a risk of this money being wasted, then why spend it at all?""

CG: So now, I mean, from the EPA's perspective, that money has been saved, it's in some account somewhere. Have they said anything about how that might be spent?

IS: So the EPA actually canceled quite a few grants meant for Alaska Native villages and various Alaska communities that were related to the impacts of climate change. And after they canceled hundreds of millions of dollars of grants meant for Alaska, what they did was they actually said, ""Now we're going to divert this money to the Denali Commission.""

And so, basically, this is $140 million that the EPA has said, ""Thanks to the fact that we canceled all these grants, we've now given $140 million to the Denali Commission."" But a lot of that money is already accounted for, for projects that don't have to do with, you know, erosion prevention and things like that. So it's really comparing apples to oranges in some cases.

CG: So we're talking about a $20 million grant specific to Kipnuk. But zooming out, the state has known for quite a while about the risks from this kind of a storm and these kind of impacts. Can you kind of walk me through that? It goes back quite a ways, right?

IS: Right, yeah, it goes back really two decades, and it's both the state and federal agencies that have been doing assessments for years, and kind of pointing to the fact that due to erosion, loss of sea ice, loss of permafrost, all of that is contributing or exacerbating the risks, environmental risks, for a lot of Alaska Native villages. And they've been pointing to potential flooding risks in many of these communities, again, for two decades.

Now we see this paper trail of report after report after report saying, ""We really need to be doing something about this."" And I think that what this storm really shows is, even though people have been saying we really need to be doing something, not enough has been done, and not just for the communities that were affected by this storm, but for quite a few other communities that may be at risk in future storms.

CG: Then, specifically talking about the administration of Gov. Mike Dunleavy, how did they respond to these risks?

IS: So we've seen actually a back and forth in administrations in Alaska for a few years. So actually it was former Gov. Sarah Palin who first created an entity in Alaska that was meant to address the impacts of climate change, and that was this kind of sub-cabinet that she had formed that created these recommendations. Among those recommendations were this idea that we need to prepare for potentially either mitigating erosion or potentially moving certain village sites that were at risk from flooding.

But then her successor (Gov. Sean Parnell) disbanded that sub-cabinet. Then, when former Gov. (Bill) Walker was in office, he created a climate change commission, which again recommended preparing for potential flooding, like what we saw now. And then Gov. Dunleavy disbanded that commission, and he really hasn't taken on sort of a similar flagship effort to try to address climate change.

We do see some of those efforts in some state agencies, so there are people within state government that really are tracking and working really, really hard on this, but without resources and sort of adequate attention, it's really, really difficult to make progress on this.

CG: You had asked Gov. Dunleavy this week about whether or not the impacts from the storm were related to climate change.

* Given the recent pattern with the Republican-appointed justices, the White House probably likes its chances in this appeal: “The Trump administration on Friday asked the Supreme Court to immediately allow for the deployment of National Guard troops in Illinois, alleging they are needed to protect federal agents conducting immigration enforcement. The move comes in response to lower court rulings that blocked the effort, with the Chicago-based 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Thursday again ruling against the administration.”

* A closely watched meeting: “Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with President Donald Trump at the White House on Friday, with long-range Tomahawk missiles and the trajectory of the war with Russia on the agenda as Kyiv intensifies its push for U.S. military aid.”

* That’s a lot of cases: “South Carolina’s measles outbreak has grown to 15 cases, state health officials reported Friday, a small increase from a few days ago. ... In Ohio, where five cases in the central part of the state have been reported within the last 2½ weeks, quarantine for 122 people was expected to end Friday. ... In the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, 118 kids are now back in school after they were exposed to an outbreak of 20 measles cases. Their quarantine ended Wednesday.”

* I’m eager to learn what the administration intends to do, exactly, with these survivors: “The U.S. is providing medical treatment to survivors from the latest attack on a vessel suspected of transporting illegal drugs in the Caribbean, according to two officials familiar with the matter. The two survivors were rescued by the Coast Guard and taken to the USS Iwo Jima, which has a full medical staff. An unspecified number of others aboard the submersible were killed in the strike, the officials said.”

* The expected plea: “John Bolton, who served as national security adviser during Donald Trump’s first term before becoming a critic of the president, pleaded not guilty on Friday to charges of mishandling classified information.”

* The more this list grows, the better: “The University of Pennsylvania and the University of Southern California on Thursday declined to sign President Trump’s proposal to give funding preferences to schools that agree to concessions, such as capping international enrollment and freezing tuition, and taking steps to protect conservative viewpoints. The rejections raised the number of universities that have said no to the offer to four, reflecting mounting opposition to the deal.”

* The University of Virginia joined the list of schools rejecting the White House’s proposed “compact” on Friday afternoon.

* U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro sure does lose a lot: “There’s already a stunning pattern of grand jurors rejecting indictments sought by the Justice Department in President Donald Trump’s second term — specifically when it comes to allegations of assaulting law enforcement in connection with protests against the administration’s abuses of power. As time goes on, we’ll learn what trial jurors think of the politically motivated cases that make it that far. We got a prime example Thursday in the case of Sidney Reid, who was acquitted in Washington, D.C.”

* A lawsuit worth watching: “More than 20 states sued the Environmental Protection Agency on Thursday, challenging the agency’s decision to cancel a $7 billion program that aimed to make solar power accessible to low-income households.”

One such nation is Australia. In a move that underlines the importance of the traditional energy sector, Australia’s gas strategy faces significant strain as midstream supply tightens in the land down under. Its gas sector has faced a troubling time as of late, despite the government’s strategy towards the sector.

The Australian government tries to strengthen its local economy with policies aimed at increasing the gas supply locally

The global energy sector is facing some troubling times ahead. The consensus prevailing around the world is that more needs to be done to increase the percentage of power that is derived from the renewable energy sector.

However, while the rest of the world invests furiously in the renewable energy sector through wind, solar, and nuclear projects, some nations still lean on their most profitable and reliable energy sources. Australia has, for generations, relied on coal and gas exports to prop up the economy.

However, recent reports have emerged that note that despite the government’s efforts, Australia’s gas sector is facing some tough times ahead. The government has implemented policies aimed at increasing supply to the local market by reducing the amount of gas exported out of the land down under.

“There are limits to what the gas policy measures can achieve on their own if the underlying causes of inadequate supply and ineffective competition are not addressed” – ACCC Commissioner Anna Brakey

The Australian Domestic Gas Security Mechanism is a policy developed by the government that mandates producers to set aside a certain percentage for the local market and encourages LNG producers to deliver less gas to their clients.

The danger has been averted for the time being in Australia

The government bodies note that the policy has had an impact, albeit a short-term one. According to the ACCC’s latest report, gas supply for the eastern coast will increase into a surplus in the first quarter of 2026. That sounds great for that side of the country, but what about the rest of Australia?

“Despite the improvement, the supply-demand outlook remains tight in the southern states.” – ACCC Commissioner Anna Brakey

Government institutions warn of a less favorable investment environment in the southern states

The report from the ACCC notes that outside investment may be affected by the lack of sustainable gas production in Australia. The report notes that more work needs to be done to improve the gas sector’s production capabilities to foster international investment.

“For the first time, southern gas producers are not expecting to produce surplus gas in the first quarter of the year, when demand is usually at its lowest. This may create challenges for fully replenishing southern gas storage facilities ahead of winter 2026.” – ACCC Commissioner Anna Brakey

The gas turbine shortages around the midstream sector have further exacerbated the issues. The Australian economy relies heavily on exporting coal and gas, which, according to government reports, may suffer if the current trend continues.

For Detroiters thinking about upgrading to a more eco-friendly home or vehicle, it can be intimidating to invest in such a major purchase, especially with the high upfront costs of new appliances and installations. But high-energy costs are a challenge for Detroiters, with about 30% of residents facing a high-energy burden, meaning they spend more than 6% of their income on utilities. By upgrading to a more energy-efficient home or car, residents can drastically reduce these costs, freeing up income for other necessities and long-term goals.

Home upgrades lower energy costs, increasing property values. But, beyond the savings benefits, a greener community is a healthier community. Eco-friendly upgrades reduce carbon emissions for everyone. Replacing gas-powered vehicles with EVs and reducing reliance on fossil fuels for home energy leads to cleaner air, which is a significant factor in respiratory health, especially for vulnerable residents. Sustainable home improvements like insulation and energy-efficient HVAC systems don’t just save money; they create a more comfortable and healthier indoor environment. By embracing these changes, Detroiters can have a path toward a community that is economically resilient and a better place to live.

The Roadblocks to Going Green

The path to going green at home can feel intimidating. Here are some common concerns:

The Upfront Cost: Eco-friendly upgrades, from solar panel installation to a new electric vehicle, often come with significant initial price tags. The perception that “going green is expensive” is a major barrier, even when the long-term savings are substantial.

The “Red Tape” and Confusion: Navigating the world of government rebates, tax credits, and financing options can feel like a full-time job. Which programs apply to me? What forms do I need? Who can I trust to do the upgrade work? This complexity can lead to a state of “analysis paralysis,” with residents postponing action rather than facing the risk of making the wrong choice.

The Fear of the Unknown: Questions about new technologies are common. “Will my car’s EV’s battery last long enough for my commute?” “Do solar panels work on cloudy Michigan days?” “How do I find a reliable solar contractor?” These legitimate concerns, if left unanswered, can prevent people from moving forward.

One Detroit Credit Union Provides Help

The company said that newcleo plans to invest up to $2 billion via an affiliated investment vehicle. Oklo added that Blykalla, Sweden's advanced nuclear technology developer, is also considering co-investing in the same projects and procuring fuel-related services from the projects.

Oklo noted that the investments aim to span multiple projects under U.S. oversight, foster transatlantic cooperation that enhances energy security, and focus on creating a robust and resilient fuel ecosystem. The company added that specific projects and investment amounts will be detailed in forthcoming definitive agreements.

Under the One Big Beautiful Bill (BBB) introduced by U.S. President Donald, tax credits retained in the bill reduce investment risks for advanced nuclear reactors.

“This agreement to implement newcleo's advanced fuel expertise into Oklo's powerhouses and invest $2 billion into American infrastructure and advanced fuel solutions is yet another win for President Donald J. Trump's American Energy Dominance Agenda,” said Secretary of the Interior and Chairman of the National Energy Dominance Council Doug Burgum.

Retail sentiment on Oklo dipped to ‘extremely bearish’ from ‘bearish’ territory a day ago, with message volumes at ‘high’ levels, according to data from Stocktwits.

The company stated that the partnership enhances all parties' capacity to meet the increasing global demand for energy. This also includes co-investment into, and co-location of, fuel fabrication facilities and could include repurposing surplus plutonium in a manner consistent with established U.S. safety and security requirements.

“Fissioning surplus plutonium is the best way to eliminate a legacy liability while creating an abundant near-term fuel source. It can accelerate the deployment of multiple gigawatts of advanced reactors and serve as a bridge fuel until uranium enrichment and recycling scale up,” said Jacob DeWitte, co-founder and CEO of Oklo.

Shares of Oklo have gained 779% in the last 12 months.

(NRDC) and data from Cox Automotive, EV prices have fallen by about $14,000 in the past year, making them only about $2,800 more expensive upfront than new gas cars. However, the availability of charging infrastructure can significantly impact cost savings.

reports that there are 104 gas pumps per 1,000 road miles compared to just 22 EV charging ports in the U.S. This disparity means that in areas with limited charging options or heavy reliance on fast chargers, the cost benefits of EVs may diminish.

Despite the higher initial cost, EVs offer long-term savings, particularly in fuel and maintenance. A analysis found that driving 100 miles in a typical gas car costs about $13, while charging an EV at home costs just $5 on average, resulting in more than 60% savings per ""fill up."" Additionally, EVs require less maintenance, with the NRDC reporting that EV maintenance is about 40% cheaper per mile compared to gas vehicles.

Government incentives for EVs are phasing out, but the NRDC-backed Atlas Public Policy study indicates that EVs remain cheaper in four out of five vehicle categories over time, excluding pickup trucks, where gas models are still more affordable.

Fueling costs favor EVs, especially in states with like Washington and Oregon. However, in states with expensive electricity, such as California and Connecticut, the cost advantage may shift towards gas vehicles, particularly if relying on public fast chargers.

Ultimately, EVs are generally cheaper to drive over time, but actual savings depend on factors such as location, vehicle type, charging options, and local electricity versus gas prices.

THE TOP FIVE

1. More than 20 states sue over Trump’s Solar for All cuts

Nearly two dozen states signed onto two lawsuits Thursday to stop the Trump administration from ending the $7 billion grant program that funded solar panels in low-income communities. The first complaint, filed Wednesday, seeks monetary damages over the Environmental Protection Agency’s bid to eliminate the so-called Solar for All program. A second lawsuit, filed Thursday, seeks to reinstate the program. Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes told Reuters the cancellation affected 900,000 low-income households nationwide, including some 11,000 in Arizona that the state expected to see a 20% spike in bills after losing access to the $156 million in funding from Solar for All. California would lose $250 million in funding. The litigation comes days after Harris County, which encompasses most of Houston, Texas, filed suit against the EPA over its own loss of $250 million due to the program’s termination. Earlier this month, a coalition of solar energy companies, labor unions, nonprofit groups, and homeowners also sued the EPA over the cancellation.

2. The UN’s maritime agency is voting on an emissions-cutting scheme

It remains to be seen whether other countries are willing to balk at the Trump administration’s push to gut key carbon-cutting policies. But at least in theory, later today, the drafting group for the International Maritime Organization, the United Nations agency overseeing global shipping, will vote on an emissions pricing mechanism meant to slash greenhouse gas output from an industry that still relies on some of the most heavily polluting fuels. The scheduled vote comes a day after President Donald Trump pressed the international body to reject the proposal, calling it “the Global Green New Scam Tax on Shipping” and vowing to ignore the rules.

The maritime shipping industry accounts for about 3% of global emissions. But the impact of shipping fuels is substantial. As Heatmap’s Robinson Meyer wrote in December, a study found that, when the IMO began enforcing rules to remove a toxic pollutant, sulfur dioxide from shipping fuels, the planet’s temperatures spiked. That’s because, in addition to inflaming the heart and lungs, triggering asthma attacks, and causing acid rain, sulfur dioxide can also reflect heat back into space, artificially cooling the Earth. When that fuel went away, the warming effects of all the carbon in the atmosphere became more apparent.

3. Defense Department drops $500 million tender to buy cobalt

The Department of Defense canceled a tender to buy cobalt, in what the trade publication Mining.com called “a fresh sign of the challenges facing Western countries trying to bolster domestic supplies of the battery metal.” In mid-August, the Defense Logistics Agency first sought offers for up to 7,500 tons of the bluish metal used in batteries and alloys for jet engines over the next five years, in a contract worth as much as $500 million. It was, according to Bloomberg, the U.S. government’s first attempt to acquire the metal since 1990. When no deals came in by the original due date of August 29, the offer was extended to October 15. But a notice published on a government website Wednesday indicated that the offer had been pulled. The move marks an apparent setback for the Pentagon’s effort to stockpile critical minerals, as I reported in this newsletter earlier this week.

While the funding doesn’t produce raw cobalt from mining, as I reported for Heatmap last month, the DLA has backed an Ohio-based startup called Xerion that’s commercializing a novel approach to processing both that metal and gallium, another mineral over which China has tightened export controls recently. It’s not alone. As Heatmap’s Katie Brigham wrote last month, “everybody wants to invest in critical mineral startups.”

4. The U.S. gains a rare earths refinery from Britain, (probably) loses a mine in Madagascar

The British rare earths processor Pensana has canceled plans for a refinery in East Yorkshire, England, in favor of investing in an American project instead. The company spent the past seven years developing a $268 million rare earths mine in Angola. One of the largest of its kind in the world, the project is scheduled to begin delivering raw materials in 2027. To turn that ore into industrial-grade materials, Pensana had planned to build a processing facility at the Saltend Chemicals Plant near Hull, England, that would have turned the metals into powerful magnets. The project won about $6.7 million in support from the British government. But Pensana’s founder and chairman, Paul Atherley, told the BBC that was “nowhere near enough.” He compared the deal to the Trump administration’s direct investment of billions of dollars into MP Materials, the country’s only rare earths mine. Pensana instead announced plans to work with the U.S. refiner ReElement to develop a domestic American supply chain, and plans to list its shares on the Nasdaq. As I wrote in Tuesday morning’s newsletter, the world’s top metals trader warned this week that the West’s mineral weakness is a lack of refining capacity, not mining. “Mining is not critical,” Trafigura CEO Richard Holtum said in London on Monday, according to Mining Journal. “True supply chain security comes from processing investment, not just extraction.”

But even the increased supply of ore from overseas projects could be in jeopardy. I have a scoop this morning in Heatmap that highlights the geopolitical challenges U.S. mining projects face overseas. On Sunday, following weeks of youth-led protests over electricity and water outages, Madagascar’s military overthrew its government in a coup. Now the new self-declared leaders have pulled support for Denver-based mining developer Energy Fuels’ plans for a giant mine that would produce rare earths, uranium, and other metals. The so-called Toliara mine, worth an estimated $2 billion, had won approval from the previous government last winter. But a consultant on the ground in Madagascar’s capital of Antananarivo told me the new leaders had “announced the definitive cancellation” of what was previously described as the future “crown jewel” of an economy where 75% of people live on less than $3 per day and less than 40% of the population has access to electricity.

5. Scientists warn of the ‘Greenlandification’ of Antarctica

As recently as the 1990s, the Greenland Ice Sheet and the Arctic were melting at a measurable pace thanks to global warming, but Antarctica’s ice cap seemed securely frozen. But, as Inside Climate News reported Thursday, “not anymore.” New satellite data and field observations show the only unpopulated continent is thawing at an alarming rate, leading to what some scientists are now calling the “Greenlandification” of Antarctica, turning it into an environment that’s melting at a rate closer to the Arctic.

There’s little question as to what is causing the meltdown. More than 100 countries now experience at least 10 more “hot days” per year than a decade ago, when the Paris climate accord was first drafted, according to new data analysis from the research groups Climate Central and World Weather Attribution published Thursday in the Financial Times. In 10 countries, the warming over the past decade added roughly a month of additional “hot days.”

THE KICKER

The good climate news, reported by Bloomberg: the Bay Area startup Rondo Energy has turned on the world’s largest industrial heat battery, a giant cubic structure that heats clay bricks with electricity from a 20-megawatt solar array to generate steam.

The bad climate news? That steam is used to force more oil out of the ground as part of Holmes Western Oil Corp.’s enhanced oil recovery system.

The mitigating factors to consider: The battery replaced a natural gas-fired boiler at the Kern County, California, facility. And proponents of enhanced oil recovery say the approach meets lasting demand for petroleum by extracting more fuel from existing wells rather than encouraging new drilling.",https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MTc3MTU2OC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2NjM4NTk4MH0.USTCcCEYxvbKZxlCwu03eqEk_ZiVcIp5BwjsIfKpa3M/image.jpg?width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C100%2C0%2C100,N,,2025-10-18 07:00:03.188890

“It’s an incredible honor,” Mukherjee says. “This award represents the culmination of teamwork, curiosity and the drive to find creative solutions to the renewable energy challenges of our time. I’m deeply thankful to the Department of Energy for recognizing our work.”

Launched in 2024, the Science Synthesis Prize challenges competitors to highlight pivotal opportunities, solutions and areas of investment to address the complications of integrating various energy sources with the electric grid.

“Our approach was exhaustive and holistic,” says Mukherjee, who also directs UB’s OASIS Laboratory and serves as an adjunct assistant professor of electrical engineering and an affiliate faculty member of the Institute for Artificial Intelligence and Data Science. “I think that’s what made our entry stand apart.”

Mukherjee and Roy conducted a systematic review of more than 300 studies conducted worldwide.

“For example, in Europe they are much more advanced in terms of renewable energies,” Mukherjee explains. “So, we reviewed a lot of case studies conducted by different universities and research institutes in Europe, and we found some success stories.”

The biggest takeaway, she says, is that most studies focus on just the technical part of converting to renewable energy, not the social or economic aspects.

“All three areas need attention,” she says. “But the majority of the attention is given to the technical side right now, especially in the U.S.”

For their paper, the two researchers examined the various facets of the challenges and opportunities associated with integrating renewable energy into the grid and then compared them with the current industry outlook.

“First, we analyzed how the various studies are contributing value to the current landscape,” she says. “Then, we’ve identified the gaps, analyzed what we can but are not doing currently, and finally, made suggestions on how we could improve the renewable energy integration process.”

She notes that the technical aspects present significant challenges that will need to be rectified, such as integrating new types of renewable energy into an aging existing grid and transmitting energy from offshore wind and solar plants to the communities that need them.

The social and economic challenges, however, are just as significant.

“Let’s look at the installation of solar panels,” she says. “There’s a huge upfront cost. While there are many clean energy programs where the government subsidizes some of the initial costs, many homeowners and businesses are either unaware of such programs or don’t understand the benefits that they might earn from installing solar panels. Over the next five to 10 years, they may receive significant benefits because of lower electricity bills, but what they see now is how much the panels cost to install.”

The study also recommends various investment strategies, including pooled investments and green bonds, which could help raise funds to cover such upfront costs.

If a community wants to install microgrids, for instance, they could get subsidies to power several homes in that community, Mukherjee says.

“Starting small from the ground level is very important for any type of new technology to flourish,” she says. “But first, you have to get acceptance from the communities.”

The problem is that many discussions on renewable energy integration overlook this crucial step — engaging communities and involving them throughout the decision-making process, from inception to implementation.

“What I’ve learned from other research studies that I’ve conducted is that when you involve the communities in the decision-making process, you’re more successful,” she says. “It plays a major role in transitioning many of these different recommendations for renewable energy integration to policies that are actionable.”",https://www.buffalo.edu/content/shared/university/news/news-center-releases/2025/10/Sayanti-Mukherjee-DOE-Award/_jcr_content/par/image.img.512.auto.jpg/1760721157663.jpg,N,,2025-10-17 22:00:36.685106

(NRDC) and data from Cox Automotive, EV prices have fallen by about $14,000 in the past year, making them only about $2,800 more expensive upfront than new gas cars. However, the availability of charging infrastructure can significantly impact cost savings.

reports that there are 104 gas pumps per 1,000 road miles compared to just 22 EV charging ports in the U.S. This disparity means that in areas with limited charging options or heavy reliance on fast chargers, the cost benefits of EVs may diminish.

Despite the higher initial cost, EVs offer long-term savings, particularly in fuel and maintenance. A analysis found that driving 100 miles in a typical gas car costs about $13, while charging an EV at home costs just $5 on average, resulting in more than 60% savings per ""fill up."" Additionally, EVs require less maintenance, with the NRDC reporting that EV maintenance is about 40% cheaper per mile compared to gas vehicles.

Government incentives for EVs are phasing out, but the NRDC-backed Atlas Public Policy study indicates that EVs remain cheaper in four out of five vehicle categories over time, excluding pickup trucks, where gas models are still more affordable.

Fueling costs favor EVs, especially in states with like Washington and Oregon. However, in states with expensive electricity, such as California and Connecticut, the cost advantage may shift towards gas vehicles, particularly if relying on public fast chargers.

“While solar and wind assets have received tax incentives in the past, current tax rates may act as a disincentive to battery investments in Brazil,” PSR highlighted.
However, energy storage is not yet explicitly covered by this mechanism.
In this context, energy storage emerges as a key element in balancing supply and demand.","A PSR report reveals that taxation and regulatory uncertainty are slowing the advancement of energy storage in Brazil, increasing costs and driving away investment. The study advocates for tax incentives and new remuneration models to unlock the sector.

While several countries are accelerating their investments in energy storage to ensure stability and flexibility over the electrical system, Brazil still faces serious obstacles to making this market viable. A study by the consulting firm PSR indicates that the high tax burden and lack of regulatory clarity are among the main obstacles to the development of this technology in the country.

The research, titled “Accelerating the Brazilian Energy Transition – Comprehensive Meta-Analysis of Energy Storage in Brazil”, shows that the average costs of implementing storage systems increase by up to 76% after taxes are applied. This is worrying, especially at a time when the country is trying to expand the use of renewable sources, such as solar and wind, which require greater balancing capacity in the electricity grid.

“While solar and wind assets have received tax incentives in the past, current tax rates may act as a disincentive to battery investments in Brazil,” PSR highlighted.

Lack of specific incentives discourages the sector

Brazil has the Special Incentive Regime for Infrastructure Development (REIDI), created by Law No. 11.488/2007, which reduces taxes on infrastructure projects. However, energy storage is not yet explicitly covered by this mechanism.

According to the study, a legal update would be necessary to include batteries and pumped-storage plants among the projects eligible for the scheme. Furthermore, any proposal seeking REIDI membership must be approved by the National Electric Energy Agency (ANEEL), a bureaucratic and lengthy process that ultimately represents another obstacle to advancing investments.

The PSR points out that, without incentives equivalent to those granted to other renewable sources, the country runs the risk of losing strategic opportunities for technological and industrial development in this field.

Price arbitrage: potential limited by the current structure

One of the most promising uses of storage systems is price arbitrage—buying energy when the cost is low and selling it when the price rises. This practice, common in mature markets like the United States and Europe, is still unlikely to be viable in Brazil.

According to PSR, for a battery system to be economically sustainable in Brazil, an average daily price difference of between US$72 and US$152 per MWh would be required, for four hours per day, over 15 years. Reversible storage plants, on the other hand, would require differences of between US$65 and US$161 per MWh, with eight-hour daily operation and a 40-year lifespan.

However, the Brazilian market still has low granularity in hourly price formation, which significantly reduces arbitrage opportunities. In 2025, the spot energy price is set between US$10,24/MWh and US$269,50/MWh, values ​​that do not guarantee the expected returns for large-scale projects.

Revenue stacking: an alternative to enabling new projects

With arbitration alone unable to justify investments, the PSR advocates for the country to adopt a revenue stacking model. This strategy would allow storage systems to receive remuneration from various sources, such as ancillary services, capacity mechanisms, and support for the operation of the electrical system.

These services include voltage and frequency control, and black start—the restart of electrical systems in the event of a blackout. Currently, most of these functions are performed by thermal and hydroelectric plants.

The creation of ""regulatory sandboxes,"" which serve as testing environments for new business models, is seen as a step forward, but still insufficient. The study cites, for example, the reactive power support project, whose remuneration for 2025 was set at US$1,72/Mvar-h. There are also plans to open sandboxes for secondary frequency control and black start, with fixed remunerations of US$11.735 and US$8.801 per year, respectively.

PSR warns: flexibility is essential for the country's energy future

With the growing penetration of solar and wind energy sources, the Brazilian electricity system needs more flexibility to ensure security and stability. In this context, energy storage emerges as a key element in balancing supply and demand.

""Brazil has great potential to develop the storage market, but this depends on adjustments to tax policy, improved regulation, and the creation of new remuneration models,"" the study concludes.

Without structural changes, the country risks falling behind in the race for energy transition, precisely at a time when the world is moving toward a cleaner, more resilient, and decentralized energy matrix.",https://clickpetroleoegas.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/armazenamento-de-energia-no-brasil.jpg,N,,2025-10-18 02:59:34.057370

“These funds were going to help low-income and rural North Carolinians save money on their energy bills,” he said.
“Thousands of families were going to have the option to install solar power, save money, and have another energy option after a major storm.
“The bottom line is this: EPA no longer has the statutory authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive.
The solar energy industry employs over 9,000 North Carolinians and supports more than 200 businesses across the state.","On Thursday, Attorney General Jeff Jackson joined 21 other states and the District of Columbia in suing the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for canceling the $7 billion Solar for All program.

Created in 2022 by the Inflation Reduction Act, the program was designed to provide funding to 60 grant recipients, with the goal of helping an estimated 900,000 low-income households across the country utilize solar power to reduce their energy costs.

Jackson said in a press release that the funds would have helped more than 12,000 households in North Carolina save an average of 20% on their utility bills and supported energy jobs.

“These funds were going to help low-income and rural North Carolinians save money on their energy bills,” he said. “Thousands of families were going to have the option to install solar power, save money, and have another energy option after a major storm. Now the EPA has illegally cancelled those funds — so I’m going to court to bring $150 million back to our state.”

In 2024, the EnergizeNC coalition, led by the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality (NCDEQ), applied for and was awarded a $156 million Solar for All grant from the EPA. According to Jackson’s press release, over five years, the program would have helped create at least 43 megawatts of solar energy and offered financial assistance to help low-income, single-family homes, multifamily housing, households with medical needs, and community solar pilot programs install rooftop solar.

The cancellation, Jackson said, left the state without more than $150 million of the $156 million it had been awarded, and the grants were “abruptly cancelled without a valid legal basis, and the attorneys general are suing to win back this money that is legally due to North Carolina and other states.”

On Aug. 7, the EPA canceled the program, which was included in the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund. Lee Zeldin, administrator for the EPA, discussed the cancellation, which resulted from the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act.”

“In some cases, your tax dollars were diluted through up to FOUR pass-through entities, each taking their own cut off the top!” he said in a post on X. “The bottom line is this: EPA no longer has the statutory authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive. Today, the Trump EPA is announcing that we are ending Solar for All for good, saving US taxpayers ANOTHER $7 BILLION!”

NCDEQ Secretary Reid Wilson said in the release that the cancellation of the program would eliminate the installation of rooftop solar panels for more than 12,000 low-and medium-income families.

“Rooftop solar drives down utility bills, reduces air pollution, and creates jobs,” he said. “The program’s cancellation would hurt the electric grid’s ability to be resilient to future disasters, and would hamper North Carolina’s efforts to ensure reliable, clean, and affordable energy supplies to meet the needs of a rapidly growing population and rising energy demand.”

The funds, the release said, would also have helped households transition to more reliable sources of energy and prevent power outages caused by natural disasters, like Hurricane Helene.

Additionally, it stated that the Solar for All program was also designed to help create an additional 140 new local jobs, including those for contractors, construction workers, and maintenance staff. The solar energy industry employs over 9,000 North Carolinians and supports more than 200 businesses across the state.

Jon Sanders, director of the Center for Food, Power, and Life at the Jon Locke Foundation, told Carolina Journal that although Jackson’s statement that the Solar for All program would have saved low-income people and their families on their power bills and created jobs is true, there is no reason for the attorney general to think that the Solar for All program is the only, or even a good, way to lower power bills and create jobs.

“With respect to helping low-income families pay for getting solar panels installed on their houses, the program could do so only for those low-income families that have a house,” he told CJ. “Others in low-income apartments and multifamily housing would not be able to avail themselves of any putative benefits. Also, the jobs he is talking about would be contract installation jobs chasing subsidized work, not full-time jobs from an expanding economy.”

Sanders said the economic research literature is filled with studies demonstrating that faster job growth happens in economies with less regulation, lower tax burdens, and greater protection of individual rights against the government.

“I would welcome a North Carolina attorney general adopting those goals for his vision of the state,” he said.

Sanders added that, given that electricity is a vital expense for all households and an input cost for every business in the state, resource decisions that result in lower power bills would lead to a stronger economy and more job creation than otherwise.",https://www.carolinajournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/solar-panels-943999_1280.jpg,N,,2025-10-17 23:59:37.887561

During a public hearing, business leaders raised concerns the new land-use change could harm Eugene’s economic competitiveness. Residents and advocacy groups urged stronger protections for west Eugene neighborhoods long affected by industrial pollution. Public comment is open through Oct. 28.

Eugene business leaders are pushing back against a proposed land-use policy aimed at better managing pollution and protecting public health.

The Public Health Standards project is an effort, four years in the making, to keep the environment clean for people who live in or near industrial areas. The project includes several possible land-use regulations that would apply to new development.

As of October, city staff is working on one of the potential code amendments.

Under the latest draft of that code change, properties engaged in certain levels of industrial production must have — or be in the process of obtaining — water, land and air pollution permits from the Lane Regional Air Protection Agency and the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality before receiving a building permit.

At a public hearing of the Eugene Planning Commission on Tuesday, Oct. 16, Joe Liebersbach, director of business advocacy at the Eugene Area Chamber of Commerce, said the chamber has “significant concerns” about the proposal.

Liebersbach called it a “misapplication of land-use law” and said the chamber worries the proposed code could hurt Eugene’s economic competitiveness, affecting job creation and access to living-wage employment.

NW Natural, a natural gas provider, and Sierra Pacific Industries, a forest products company, both submitted written public comment to the city underscoring the points made by Liebersbach.

In a statement to Lookout Eugene-Springfield, Liebersbach said, “Our concern isn’t with the goal, but with how it’s achieved. We believe public health standards can and should be strengthened through clear, objective and coordinated processes that promote accountability and economic vitality, but those goals are not achieved through land-use code amendments.”

A vision shift

Tuesday’s discussion marked a shift in how the project has been framed. Earlier this year, many conversations focused on preventing the work of bad actors such as the shuttered and Superfund-listed J.H. Baxter & Co. By Tuesday, the conversation had turned to whether new regulations would be effective in stopping violations of that magnitude.

Eugene Planning Commissioner Tiffany Edwards asked the city’s land-use supervisor, Reid Verner, who’s been overseeing the project, if current businesses are operating without required environmental permits.

“There’s no specific quantitative evidence regarding this, but there is anecdotal evidence from our talks with LRAPA and DEQ that there have been instances where applicants come to the city, obtain building permits, and start developing the site only to later receive complaints. Then they find out they hadn’t started the LRAPA or DEQ permitting process that was required,” Verner said.

Such instances are why Beyond Toxics Executive Director Jen Davis emphasized the need for meaningful protections during her public comment.

Davis, who stepped into the Beyond Toxics role earlier this year, pointed to the environmental justice group’s original policy request: overlay zones. An overlay zone is a special zoning layer placed on top of existing zoning to add or modify regulations for an area without changing the underlying zoning. In this case, the overlay zone would require buffers between homes and industrial areas where the two converge.

Currently, the only such zone is the Clear Lake overlay, which created a buffer around the site of a planned facility by a developer known for building Amazon distribution centers.

Residents in the Trainsong and Bethel neighborhoods — who live in a V-shaped wedge between some of Eugene’s most heavily industrialized areas — bear the city’s most concentrated pollution, Beyond Toxics said.

Those neighborhoods, however, lack any city-sanctioned public health protections.

“The human costs are real. Families in west Eugene have faced higher rates of cancer, asthma, and other chronic illnesses. Parents have watched their children suffer with preventable health problems,” said Davis, who was joined by Arjorie Arberry-Baribeault.

Arberry-Baribeault lived in Bethel when Baxter illegally boiled off toxic wastewater into the air. Her daughter was diagnosed with, and survived, Hodgkin’s lymphoma — a cancer that weakens the body’s ability to fight infections.

“Had there been a code like the public health standards in place before my child’s illness in 2018, I believe what my child went through could have been avoided,” Arberry-Baribeault said. “My seat at the table has brought the voices of the community into decision-making spaces, bringing humanity into a conversation too often only discussed in statistics.”

Next steps

The Public Health Standards processwas hobbled when city staff failed to follow through with plans to perform a technical analysis that could have provided key data to help persuade city councilors to continue the project. In its absence, residents of the area have argued that their own experiences should factor into that analysis.

City staff have pointed to challenges finding qualified experts. As of May, the hazard and risk assessment remains in progress. The city did not get back to Lookout Eugene-Springfield on its status as of Wednesday.

The assessment will inform potential additional code amendments for new development in or near industrial areas. In the meantime, Verner’s team continues to revise the single code amendment, related to LRAPA and DEQ permits as directed by the City Council.

Staff will make further revisions based on feedback, including comments from Lane Regional Air Protection Agency Director Travis Knudsen, who told commissioners he supports enhanced procedures in the interest of public health but is concerned about how they would function within existing processes. The team is also considering additional feedback from other agencies and community members.",https://i0.wp.com/lookouteugene-springfield.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/20250812_EugeneStock_022_IW-scaled-1.jpg?fit=2560%2C1707&ssl=1,N,,2025-10-18 02:59:28.570956

A Proclamation

From the Appalachian Mountains to the Mississippi River to the Great Plains and beyond, for nearly 250 years, America has been endlessly sustained and enriched by our abundance of precious natural resources like oil, clean coal, minerals, and natural gas. This National Energy Dominance Month, my Administration proudly recommits to harnessing the liquid gold and minerals under our feet and bountiful resources in our waters, forests, and fields, achieving American energy dominance, and forging a future defined by three simple words: “Drill, baby, drill.”

During my first term in office, America became the number one producer of oil and natural gas in the world and the coal industry was coming back — after eight hard years of Obama’s War on Coal. Tragically, after the conclusion of my first term, the previous administration launched a war on American energy — reversing all of my historic first term actions, leading all 50 States to hit record-high gas prices. Meanwhile, the Green New Scam shuttered dozens of coal plants leaving our power grid vulnerable, halted mining productions, and shipped our energy jobs from Texas to Tehran, from the Midwest to Moscow, and from Baton Rouge to Beijing. As I have stated many times before, energy security is national security. My predecessor outrageously depleted our Strategic Petroleum Reserve — emboldening our enemies and making us reliant on foreign nations while subjecting the American people to sky-high energy prices here at home.

This period of national self-destruction ended on January 20, 2025. As the 47th President of the United States, my energy policy is defined by maximum production, maximum prosperity, and maximum power. On my first day in office, I declared a National Energy Emergency to lower escalating energy prices. I signed an Executive Order to unleash American energy, which rolled back energy restrictions imposed by the previous administration. I established the National Energy Dominance Council to ensure the American energy industry maintains its global leadership in the decades to come. I also took action to revive America’s dominance in offshore critical minerals and resources, lift burdensome regulations on coal plants to ensure they can continue to run, launch the nuclear energy renaissance, and open up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska, one of the largest drilling sites in the world. Every day, we are making good on our promise to restore the United States as a global energy superpower — and our work has only just begun. Now, under my Administration, our workers are drilling, mining, and producing like never before.

This month, we continue our crusade to bring back American energy dominance, uplift the American worker, protect the American industry, cherish American resources, and make America the most prosperous country on the face of the Earth.

NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 2025 as National Energy Dominance Month.

What’s The Punctum Of The 2025 Hyundai Elantra Hybrid?","New cars are way too freaking expensive. Sure, they have more showroom appeal than ever before, but a lot of people who could spend about $30,000 on a new car ten years ago can still only spend about $30,000 on a new car. At the same time, fuel’s become more expensive, and the number of cars out there for less than 30,000 greenbacks is smaller than ever before. Thank goodness the Hyundai Elantra Hybrid still exists.

This isn’t the first time we’ve been behind the wheel of Hyundai’s electrified compact sedan, but a lot has changed since 2023. Not only did the Elantra get a facelift, the whole new car market has grown even more wild. Just last month, the average price of a new car in America crossed the $50,000 barrier, and while part of that was due to a rush on EVs before federal tax credits ended, it still means we’re living in a world where a four-figure car payment is increasingly normalized. So what can you still get for less than half that? An excellent daily driver, as it turns out.

Why Does It Exist?

In case you haven’t looked at the new car market in a decade, hybrids are hotter than those glowing metal balls you see while doomscrolling, so it simply makes sense that Hyundai builds an Elantra Hybrid to do battle against the Toyota Corolla Hybrid and the Honda Civic Hybrid. When it comes to reasonably priced fuel-sippers, this is one of the big three.

How Does It Look?

You know how baby pangolins always look like they’re about to sheepishly deliver some mildly sad but not day-ruining news? I know we humans are prone to anthropomorphizing everything under the sun, but I swear there’s a hint of endangered scaly anteater to the look of the Elantra. Maybe it’s the interplay of the bulbous silhouette with the angular character lines, maybe it’s exacerbated by the diamond pattern in the C-pillar filler panels, but like the strange-looking animal, this is one strange-looking car. Still, sometimes good things come in strange-looking packages.

What About The Interior?

Maybe it’s just me, but as the average car continues to grow more expensive, I’m warming up to the cabin of Hyundai’s value sedan. Alright, I wouldn’t trust the console grab handle to withstand much more than the weight of a chicken shawarma platter, but apart from that, nothing inside the Elantra feels flimsy or egregiously cheap. Some of it’s properly nice, like real metal trim and available denim-like cloth on the door cards. The only real complaint I have when it comes to usability is the metal trim on the steering wheel. It’s right where the edge of your palms rest with your hands at nine-and-three, and it gets frigid when the mercury hits the zone that tells you who’s wearing too thin a shirt.

Besides, the big story here is space and comfort. It’s no secret the Elantra is big-boned for a compact, but that just means you can get three real adults in the rear seat, and all of their luggage for a weekend away fits in the 14.2 cu.-ft. trunk. Of course, the best seats in the house are still up front, with a surprising amount of support for compact car thrones. We’re talking cushions that don’t seem like topographical maps of Kansas and instead actually feel designed for real human beings, a good reason to consider the Elantra Hybrid over the Corolla Hybrid. I do wish the tilt-and-telescoping steering column telescoped further towards the driver, but the overall driving position is perfectly comfortable for someone of average height.

How Does It Drive?

Of course, if you’re considering making a Hyundai Elantra Hybrid your next daily driver, it’s probably not simply due to its spaciousness and out-there looks. After all, you can get those in a regular non-hybrid model, but the hybrid powertrain really is something special beyond its headline fuel economy figures.

On paper, it may only pump out 132 horsepower, but 195 lb.-ft. of combined torque mean that off the mark and when changing lanes, the Elantra Hybrid always feels perfectly quick enough. What’s more, because this sedan uses a six-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission instead of a CVT, you aren’t forced to listen to an atonal wall of sound should you need to put the skinny pedal to the carpet. Score. Of course, this test car has the big wheels that knock fuel economy down a touch, but it still returned an honest 51 MPG with journalists treating the throttle pedal like a stompbox all day.

Even though the Elantra Hybrid gets multilink rear suspension, don’t expect it to feel like a sport compact car with hybrid efficiency. This thing leans firmly toward comfort, because most people just want a smooth ride home after eight hours in the cubicle. It turns out that all the fuss Hyundai made about structural adhesives means the comfy suspension can actually do its job, so this compact sedan glides over bumps with the grace of a midsizer. See, the operative word here is “natural.”

The steering weighs up like you’d expect steering to. The brake pedal feels normal, almost like it doesn’t have to blend regenerative braking from the electric motor with hydraulic braking from the, um, brakes. Even the shifter’s normal, so you could give the Elantra Hybrid to someone who’s been driving a 2006 Civic for the past two decades, and nothing will seem weird to them. Fantastic.

Does It Have The Electronic Crap I Want?

Sort-of. All the gadgetry inside the Elantra Hybrid feels a bit five years ago, but in ways that aren’t exactly a letdown. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto only work over a wired USB-A connection, but Hyundai’s previous-generation infotainment system is still reasonably slick, with logical menus and plenty of physical controls. The digital gauge cluster might not show you what song’s currently playing, but you can set it to this fun cube-themed skin that delivers a bong hit of when-the-internet-was-fun nostalgia directly into your hippocampus.

This fully-loaded trim gets a moonroof, dual-zone climate control, wireless smartphone charging, GPS navigation, heated seats, a heated steering wheel, an eight-speaker Bose sound system that isn’t too shabby considering the segment, and ambient lighting, all for a shade over $31,000. That’s a lot of kit for the money.

Three Things To Know About The 2025 Hyundai Elantra Hybrid:

Diesel-like torque means it doesn’t feel slow.

It uses a subdivided section of its hybrid battery pack to power its 12-volt electrics, so you’ll never have to buy a replacement lead-acid battery for it.

You can get one loaded to the gills with toys for about the same price as the cheapest Civic Hybrid.

Does It Fulfill Its Purpose?

Absolutely. The Hyundai Elantra Hybrid is a lot of good, economical car for the sort of money normal people can actually justify. Whether you’re looking at the $26,695 Elantra Hybrid Blue or the $31,045 Elantra Hybrid Limited, it feels like your money’s going far. While a comparably equipped Honda Civic Hybrid is quicker and more premium-feeling, it’s also thousands of dollars more expensive. At the same time, a Corolla Hybrid doesn’t feel much nicer than the Elantra Hybrid, is a whole lot slower, isn’t as comfortable, and costs about the same as the Hyundai. Even though Toyota has a rock-solid hybrid system, you still have to sit in that driver’s seat every day, so the Elantra Hybrid gets my vote hands-down.

Believe it or not, the Elantra Hybrid is an even better deal in Canada, where its single loaded trim level undercuts the cheapest Civic Hybrid by several thousand loonies, and works out about even with a mid-range Corolla Hybrid on price while offering a handful of features unavailable on the Toyota.

What’s The Punctum Of The 2025 Hyundai Elantra Hybrid?

With loads of toys, a great price, proper hybrid fuel economy, and solid comfort, welcome to the happy medium of the hybrid compact sedan market.

In September, the House passed resolutions under the Congressional Review Act (CRA)—a little-known 1996 law that Congress enacted to overturn certain federal agency actions through a special review process—to roll back three resource management plans (RMPs) for managing public lands under the BLM for Montana, Alaska and North Dakota. Those plans collectively guide decisions on over 166 million acres, shaping oil and gas leasing, renewable energy, grazing and habitat protections. The Senate voted to approve all three rollbacks on Oct. 8 and 9.

‎While there are no BLM managed public lands in any Midwest states, those who track public land policy warned that if the CRA applies to BLM, for example, it could potentially also apply to U.S. Forest Service (USFS), the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and National Park Service plans. Those agencies oversee lands in Midwest, Southern and East Coast states.

“It would translate into potentially reviewing plans by the Forest Service as well as the Fish and Wildlife Service for the management of national wildlife refuges, as well as the National Park Service,” said Sam Kalen, McKinney Family Chair in Environmental Law at Indiana University McKinney School of Law. Kalen joined 30 other legal experts in signing an open letter opposing the resolutions last month.

“What you would see next is an effort to try to mirror what’s happening in the West to park lands, or wildlife lands, or forest lands…,” he said. “What we’re seeing is an effort by some in Congress, as well as potentially maybe some in the administration, to try to adversely affect how we’re going to be managing and protecting our resources in the future.”

Invoking the CRA in this manner would give Congress the final word on documents that have historically been crafted through years of federally mandated public comment, tribal and stakeholder consultation, on-the-ground land manager input and environmental review intended to balance multiple uses, such as grazing, energy development, recreation and conservation.

If the CRA application broadens as experts fear it will, every time a new plan is developed to determine the management objectives and activities allowed on those lands in the future, the agency will have to submit the plan changes to Congress.

Kalen gave the example of the BLM plan to end coal leasing in the Powder River Basin in Wyoming. “If you want to change the plan to allow coal leasing, what that would mean is you would go develop a new plan, and you’d have to submit that to Congress with a potential CRA possibility,” Kalen said. “What I think some of the Republicans want to do is be able to take a look at the plans issued under the Biden administration, such as the plan that effectively shut down coal leasing, and be able to overturn that plan.”

If an agency such as the USFS wanted to change an existing plan for activities that occur on public lands, the plan would be subject to congressional disapproval. This hasn’t been done in the past, and “it’s going to create a nightmare and considerable uncertainty for all affected parties if the agencies have to wait and see what happens in Congress under the CRA every time they change or amend their plans,” Kalen said.

This is worrisome, he said, because of the CRA’s “substantially similar” clause, which prohibits agencies from issuing new rules that are too much like those Congress has rejected using the act. However, the term is poorly defined, so plans could be struck down without explanation, making it more difficult for agencies to draft a new one.

If an agency goes through the process for developing a plan, including gathering public input and working on the plan for over a year and the plan gets thrown out, that agency has also wasted time, resources and expertise. This could deter them from developing new plans, he explained.

The CRA was intended to be used to overturn recently enacted federal regulations. Kalen speculated that Republicans’ objective is to more easily overturn plans passed during the Biden administration, as this is not the first time the Trump administration has used it. For example, Trump rescinded Obama-era methane rules, along with about 100 other environmental regulations, during his first term. But within months of Biden’s election, the Democratic-controlled Congress rescinded Trump’s rescission of the methane rules; it was one of three Trump actions lawmakers killed using the CRA.

Another expert who also signed the open letter explained that since BLM manages public lands under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act, invoking the CRA in this context could have long-term implications for management plans on other statutes.

“If Congress is successful in using the CRA to overturn a BLM resource management plan, they could then use the same principles to overturn other federal agencies’ planning documents,” said Alexandra Klass, a law professor at the University of Michigan Law School who also served as the deputy general counsel for energy efficiency and clean energy demonstrations at the Department of Energy from April 2022 to July 2023. “I don’t think it’s an appropriate use of the CRA for any of them, but it’d be the same idea.”

Klass added that although agencies like the USFS have their own planning processes under their respective enabling statutes, if Congress is able to invoke the CRA for BLM plans, “they could do it for the department of the Forest Service’s equivalent.”

“In theory, if they are successful in using the CRA to get rid of a resource management plan, they could do that anywhere,” she added, but specified that experts’ main concerns are currently about Western plans. Many land use plans in Midwest states, she explained, are decades old and less likely to be targeted than Biden-era plans in Western states.

Long term, Klass said that requiring plans to be approved by Congress could result in BLM lands that are not protective of the environment, as “it takes away some of the tools that the agency has to guide land use.” For example, BLM has a multiple-use mandate that requires an RMP to balance recreation, industry and environmental protection, setting priorities for different types of lands that have various features and resources.

“By taking those away you could have uncertainty for different types of activities,” Klass said, “and you also have much less ability to restrict certain types of development that can harm other uses of federal lands.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2240765539-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-10-17 19:03:23.267843

This approval clears a critical hurdle for Micron Technology’s planned $100 billion semiconductor megafab in Clay.

The decision links energy infrastructure, jobs, and clean power to one of the largest private investments in U.S. manufacturing history. The move also ties into the CHIPS and Science Act and the push to rebuild domestic chip capacity.

Micron Plant and New York’s power transmission approval

The Micron Plant is Micron Technology’s plan for a massive memory chip factory and supporting campus in Central New York. The company needs reliable, high-capacity electricity to run fab tools, cleanrooms, and cooling systems.

New York’s Public Service Commission approved a transmission line to bring that power to the site. This line is meant to deliver stable, low-carbon energy, making advanced chip-making possible at scale.

The project now moves from planning into infrastructure delivery, a major step for the Micron Plant timeline.

Why is this approval a turning point? Because a megafab needs steady, scaled power, this approval removes a key bottleneck for construction and operation.

Why the power transmission project matters for the Micron Plant

The transmission project connects the Micron Plant to New York’s grid and to renewable energy sources. Officials said the plan will help Micron meet sustainability goals while ensuring operational reliability.

The state aims to integrate hydropower and other clean sources over time, which supports Micron’s (MU) target to run on greener energy.

For a semiconductor plant, energy stability is not optional; it is central to yield and uptime. The approved transmission line gives Micron (MU) that foundation.

Why did New York approve this project now? Timing reflects infrastructure readiness, political support, and the urgency to secure U.S. chip supply chains.

Micron Plant economic and technological impact for Syracuse and beyond

The Micron Plant promises large economic gains for Central New York. Micron projects tens of thousands of jobs when construction and supply chains are counted. Local universities, including Syracuse University, stand to gain from training programs and research partnerships.

The factory will also anchor a regional semiconductor cluster that could attract suppliers and service firms. At the national level, the plant strengthens U.S. capacity for memory chips, reducing reliance on overseas manufacturing and supporting industries from data centers to AI.

Can this project reshape America’s semiconductor future? Yes, by adding domestic capacity, it lowers strategic risk and builds a local tech ecosystem.

Sustainability and clean energy integration for the Micron Plant

Micron has made public commitments to sustainability. The company aims to ramp up renewable energy use and efficiency in its operations. The new transmission project helps by enabling access to cleaner sources, including hydropower and solar, which New York plans to expand.

Aligning the Micron Plant with the state’s clean energy goals also supports the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act objectives. Running a chip fab on greener power reduces the carbon footprint of the entire tech stack.

How green will the Micron Plant be? The plant is planned with a path toward high renewable use, and the transmission line is a major enabler.

Government and industry reactions to the Micron Plant approval

Gov. Kathy Hochul and state leaders praised the decision as a win for jobs and clean industry. Micron’s executives highlighted the project as a step toward U.S. chip leadership and supply chain resilience. Industry groups noted the approval as a sign that states can partner on large-scale infrastructure that supports advanced manufacturing.

The tone from both the government and Micron (MU) suggests steady collaboration ahead for permitting, grid upgrades, and workforce programs. (Channel News Asia, Investing.com.)

What did leaders say about the project? Officials framed the approval as a boost for regional growth and national tech security.

Broader implications for the semiconductor industry from the Micron Plant

The Micron Plant joins a wave of U.S. chip investments, alongside other large projects like Intel’s Ohio expansions and TSMC’s Arizona site. Memory chip demand grows as AI, cloud, and automotive applications need more storage and faster processing. Micron’s megafab is aimed at meeting that demand.

The project also signals to global markets that the U.S. intends to be a major player in memory chip production, not only in logic chips. This balance matters for both commerce and national security.

How does Micron compare to other chip projects? Micron’s plan is among the largest in scale, focusing on memory and storage technology, which complements logic chip investments.

The road ahead for the Micron Plant, infrastructure, and community plans

Next steps for the Micron Plant include construction of the transmission line, ground breaking on fab buildings, environmental reviews, and workforce training rollouts. Federal CHIPS Act funds and state incentives will support parts of the build.

Micron (MU) also plans R&D collaborations and supplier outreach to grow the local ecosystem. The company and state leaders have signalled plans for community investments, including schools and training centers to prepare local talent for high-tech jobs. Timelines will unfold over the next several years as construction ramps up.

What should communities expect next? Expect construction jobs, supplier growth, and long-term technical roles, along with infrastructure improvements.

Conclusion: Why the Micron Plant power approval matters nationally

The New York approval of the power transmission project clears a major hurdle for the Micron Plant. It links clean energy, high-tech manufacturing, and regional economic growth. More than a local win, it is a national signal that the U.S. can build the energy and industrial backbone needed for advanced chip-making.

If Micron (MU) delivers on its plans, the plant will be a landmark in America’s effort to regain semiconductor strength, while showing how clean infrastructure can support next next-generation industry.

The Micron Plant is now closer to becoming a real engine of jobs and innovation. The interplay of technology, sustainability, and policy in this project may shape the next decade of U.S. manufacturing.

""Some of them come, they fold their arms like that and they’re very suspicious,"" he said Friday. ""Then by the end of the day, they’re ‘Oh I get it.’ They realize it’s been a mistake for Republicans to not be engaged. Because we do, we care deeply about the Earth. We tend to talk about it differently.""

Sen. Curtis has earned a reputation as one of the few Republican political leaders to talk about climate change. He brings together people from all sides at the Conservative Climate Summit to talk about environmental issues and try to find solutions.

On Friday at the University of Utah, there were discussions about water demands, renewable energy sources, land issues and nuclear power. People wore green hats that declared ""Make America Beautiful Again."" Sen. Curtis touted bipartisan legislation on forest management and wildfire mitigation making its way through Congress. Speaking to reporters, the senator emphasized his support for an ""all of the above"" approach to energy.

U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright endorsed Utah's nuclear power ambitions during a discussion with the senator (Wright appeared virtually because of the ongoing U.S. government shutdown).

""Nuclear’s going to become sexy again,"" Wright declared to a packed ballroom. ""I’m also super excited about next-generation geothermal. And frankly, Utah is the leader in that.""

Utah moves to create special office to handle nuclear power:

But not all topics bring everyone together. Wright endorsed extending the life of some coal plants, arguing that America's energy demands call for it. Some environmentalists in the room were less-than-thrilled.

""What’s not sexy is the increasing costs from the nuclear industry,"" Carmen Val Dez with the Healthy Environmental Alliance of Utah told FOX 13 News. ""From building plants that increase over time, the long timelines it’s going to take to these plants on board, which may not meet our energy needs or climate needs, frankly. As well as not really addressing or acknowledging the harms the nuclear industry has had on Utah.""

Val Dez said she did like what Sen. Curtis was trying to accomplish with the Conservative Climate Summit.

""Climate doesn’t impact just one party or the other,"" she said.

Eliza Cowie with Stewardship Utah said she has appreciated Sen. Curtis' efforts to try to extend renewable energy credits. She said the summit was also important in educating people.

""I think it is an important step in a larger process of addressing our climate solutions,"" she said.

Asked about the Trump administration's rollback of some renewable energy projects, Sen. Curtis told reporters: ""I have concerns.

The board’s approval of the rezoning conditions is nonbinding but indicates a favorable recommendation of the proposal to the Apex Town Council based on environmental impacts when the council considers the rezoning, if the conditions are met.
“We’re trying to work in a collaborative way with the town, with the community,” Natelli says.
Still, the impacts of emerging data storage facilities, used to power technology and increasingly powerful AI, are being felt across the country.
But the Town of Apex has its own local distribution and transmission rates.","At the heart of the debate over whether Apex should annex and rezone a parcel of land located in New Hill just south of Old U.S. Highway 1 for a proposed data storage facility is a central question: Do town leaders envision that property as a corridor for future industrial growth, or do they want it to remain rural pastureland?

If it’s the former, developer Michael Natelli argues, his company’s proposed New Hill Digital Campus is an ideal use for the site; if it’s the latter, he says, his business here is done.

The town’s long-range planning documents, including its Comprehensive Plan, have identified the site for industrial use for at least the past decade, but it is currently zoned for low-density residential.

On Thursday evening, the Town of Apex’s Environmental Advisory Board (EAB), working on the assumption that Apex leaders are still planning for that industrial use, voted 6–3 to side with Natelli after his company, Natelli Investments, LLC, submitted rezoning conditions aimed at addressing the environmental impacts of the project, including sound pollution, water and electricity usage, and the presence of diesel-fueled generators proposed for the site.

The board is composed of volunteers with expertise in conservation, environmental engineering, land use, and related areas. The board’s approval of the rezoning conditions is nonbinding but indicates a favorable recommendation of the proposal to the Apex Town Council based on environmental impacts when the council considers the rezoning, if the conditions are met. The town’s planning board will weigh in on the land use, and the town council will ultimately decide whether to grant the rezoning to industrial use. Continued opposition from residents is expected.

In an interview ahead of the board meeting earlier this week, Natelli told the INDY that he recognizes the proposal would be a major change for the area, but if the town is going to stick with its plan for an industrial use for the site, a data storage facility would be less disruptive than a manufacturing plant, recycling facility, or distribution warehouse, for example. He says the company will go beyond basic requirements for buffers, setbacks, and vegetation to minimize light and noise pollution, and at the board meeting, he committed to regular sound testing and monitoring.

“We’re trying to work in a collaborative way with the town, with the community,” Natelli says.

Still, the impacts of emerging data storage facilities, used to power technology and increasingly powerful AI, are being felt across the country. Large facilities like this one use staggering amounts of electricity and in some cases water, and for many Americans living close to them, the quality-of-life issues are real.

“As a founding member of this board, I don’t think there could possibly be enough zoning conditions to mitigate the negative effects of this proposal,” said EAB member Katie Schaaf, one of the dissenting voters, at Thursday’s meeting.

Natelli acknowledges that there is a lot of negative media coverage about data centers, much of it “rightly so, because there are a lot of projects that, for one reason or another, should be scrutinized for certain reasons.”

But he disagrees with the premise that data centers “are bad all the time.”

“Certain areas like this, I feel, are very compelling for data centers,” he says. “Other areas are not. If we can start looking at things on a project-by-project basis … I do think we can find a way to mitigate a lot of the concerns that are out there, if people are willing to have an open mind about it.”

Here’s a look at the plans for the facility so far, some of the environmental issues under discussion, the community’s concerns, and how the developer has proposed to address those concerns in the rezoning conditions.

Electricity usage

There’s no getting around it—data centers are power intensive, and this one especially so with a request for 300 megawatts from Duke Energy (for context, that’s about a third of the total energy output of the nearby Shearon Harris nuclear plant).

Natelli Investments submitted a load study to Duke Energy this spring, and Natelli says the company “feels comfortable” asking for that much power. Transmission lines already exist that could link the property to Shearon Harris, and the developer would pay for any infrastructure upgrades needed.

But residents worry that the massive electricity usage would cause their power bills to surge.

Natelli says the facility wouldn’t be taking power directly or exclusively from Shearon Harris but from several different power plants that serve Duke Energy’s grid, and the utility would figure out how to supply the 300 megawatts incrementally.

“Duke [Energy] … is evaluating the ability for them to serve our requested load, as well as what impacts that load might have on the transmission system, and any upgrades required to the transmission system—the extension of power, the substation, switching stations—we have to bear the cost of all that,” Natelli says. “It’s a very, very big commitment, but it’s a commitment that we’re making, and we’re not pushing that cost … on to other people in Apex.”

But a recent report from Bloomberg found that wholesale electricity costs up to 267 percent more than it did five years ago in areas located near data centers, especially in Northern Virginia and Maryland (where Natelli Investments is based), where data centers are highly concentrated.

“It’s an increasingly dramatic ripple effect of the AI boom as energy-hungry data centers send power costs to records in much of the US, pulling everyday households into paying for the digital economy,” the report states.

In North Carolina, as Duke Energy evaluates its capacity to provide power for data centers planned statewide, there’s a possibility that the state’s Utilities Commission will have to raise rates on all consumers. But the Town of Apex has its own local distribution and transmission rates.

“And we’re not touching that,” Natelli says. “There’s nothing we’re doing that’s going to influence the retail rates that [the town] is charging Apex residents.”

Water usage

Part of the draw of the New Hill site is its proximity to the Western Wake Regional Water Reclamation Facility, a wastewater treatment plant jointly owned by the towns of Apex and Cary that’s situated just a few hundred feet from the property.

With the plant, an 18 million–gallon-per-day facility with a reclaimed water system already on-site, a prospective client would have the option to use nonpotable treated wastewater —between 0.5 million and 1.5 million gallons per day—for cooling inside the data storage facility.

It’s likely the water would only be used for cooling during the hottest months, representatives for Natelli told the EAB, and the new facility could provide on-site storage for the treated wastewater in the case of an emergency.

It’s also likely that an end user for the site wouldn’t require water at all, as some companies have shifted to using air or fluid cooling systems for their equipment.

“A lot of users are moving away from using water altogether,” said Kraig Walsleben, a consultant for Natelli Investments.

If the site does end up using wastewater, about a third of the water used would evaporate during the cooling process.

“We would have to evaluate ecological impacts,” Walsleben said.

Diesel generators

Natelli’s proposal calls for 80 three-megawatt backup generators to be located on the site. Each would be housed inside a tractor-trailer-sized storage container, with a diesel fuel tank stored underneath.

The diesel generators have been a source of anxiety for residents. Burning diesel, a fossil fuel, releases nitrogen oxide, sulfur oxide, carbon monoxide, and particulate matter into the atmosphere.

“Air pollutants are silent killers,” said Michelle O’Connor, a resident of the neighboring Jordan Pointe community, at Apex’s regularly scheduled town council meeting this week. “These particulates are a unique threat as they not only are capable of penetrating lung and olfactory tissues but are small enough to cross the blood-brain barrier. There is no exposure level that is considered safe, just levels that are considered acceptable.”

In their zoning conditions, Natelli pledges to use Tier 4–equivalent generators, which are designed to meet the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s strictest emission standards. They are the most energy efficient and have particulate filters and internal processes to treat emissions, Natelli says.

The generators would all need to be permitted to meet standards set by the EPA and the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality, and they would be used rarely. The facility would be running on higher-voltage-transmission power lines rather than regular residential distribution lines, Walsleben explained, and transmission power lines are less impacted by weather or other emergencies that tend to knock out power.

Noise pollution

For a few of the EAB members, and for some members of the community, concerns over noise associated with the generators, cooling equipment, and other aspects of the data storage facility are some of the most pressing.

Natelli Investments has sought to address potential noise impacts in its rezoning conditions in several ways.

First of all, the company wants to work with the Town of Apex to create a more robust noise ordinance that will provide an objective way to measure noise output and make sure the facility is in compliance.

In addition to doing its own sound evaluations, the company committed at the board meeting to paying for an independent consultant hired by the town to work on sound attenuation and testing measures. Increased setbacks, the company’s representatives said, will also help, as will buffers with vegetation.

“We’re going to implement design measures like berming and landscaping and noise fencing if required,” Natelli told the INDY. “There are attenuation measures that can be built around the equipment. We’re fully committed to doing whatever we need to to ensure that the sound isn’t causing a problem, and it’s at levels that are deemed acceptable.”

He adds that at the property line, the noise could, at 55 or 60 decibels, sound like a normal conversation. The company plans to study how the sound travels to nearby neighborhoods like Jordan Pointe.

“It’ll hopefully put a number of people at ease,” Natelli says.

While the residents in attendance vocally disagreed, it did seem to put the majority of the EAB members at ease. Board member Bill Jensen said the digital campus could provide an opportunity for more Apex residents to work where they live rather than commuting to Raleigh or elsewhere.

“I’ll be frank, I think this property is a decent area for light industrial,” said Jensen before making a motion to approve the rezoning conditions. “‘I’m sorry, I know that’s probably going against the grain, but if you do these things right, and you make a live-work situation, then everybody can benefit. And that’s the critical thing, and that’s what we’re trying to do, is make this thing right.”",https://indyweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-10-16-apex-data-center-eniviro-illo-npm-v3.jpg,N,,2025-10-17 19:03:31.954683

The current Trump administration has promised to bring it back with the attitude of “mine, baby, mine.” However, two recently scheduled federal coal lease sales in the region were a flop.","Republican governors discussed their plan for “Unleashing American Energy” at a recent Montana economic conference.

The panel, which included Wyoming’s Gov. Mark Gordon, Montana’s Gov. Greg Gianforte, Nebraska’s Gov. Jim Pillen and Gov. Puerto Rico’s Jennifer González-Colón, cheered on Pres. Trump’s executive orders that are rolling back federal oversight of industry.

“It's a new day in Washington with President Trump,” said Gianforte, who led the speakers.

The governors highlighted Trump’s efforts to fast track energy projects. For example, some review times on federal environmental assessments have been reduced from one year to 14 days, and for environmental impact statements, it’s truncated from two years to 28 days. This is part of the administration’s dismantling of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). It’s a 55-year-old federal act, often thought of as the Magna Carta of environmental policy, that requires federal agencies to consider and assess environmental impacts of a project.

Gordon also cheered the move to streamline the process. He brought up Wyoming’s TerraPower project, which will be a first of its kind nuclear power plant. The project was announced in 2020.

“It took, let me see, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, independent NEPA analyses between the NRC (Nuclear Regulatory Commission), the EPA (Environmental Protection Agency), and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM),” Gordon said. “That is absolutely ridiculous.”

Gordon said the federal government and states need to get out of their own way, specifically with permitting new energy projects.

“You can regulate by saying, ‘Here's what we would like you to do. However you get there, do it.’ That's cool. That's America,” Gordon said.

Nebraska’s Gov. Pillen said more can be done to get energy projects off the ground. He called for ending the federal permitting process for energy industries, which includes NEPA, citing a Nebraska transmission line project that’s been in limbo for more than a decade.

“We got people that are just continuing to create more roadblocks and roadblocks. We have to end the permitting,” Pillen said. “We gotta steamroll the permitting process.”

However, many conservation groups are raising red flags with Trump’s rollback of NEPA. Earthjustice said NEPA is key for government transparency and accountability, and that actions to dismantle it “fundamentally undermine the public’s ability to participate in federal decision-making processes.”

The governors also discussed the coal market, with an eye toward Montana and Wyoming. The states are home to the Powder River Basin, which is the top producing coal region in the country. The coal market has declined for more than 15 years, even during the first Trump administration. The current Trump administration has promised to bring it back with the attitude of “mine, baby, mine.” However, two recently scheduled federal coal lease sales in the region were a flop.

“We need to get coal leasing out there, and coal companies need to bid more than it costs for a new haul truck for those leases,” said Gordon.

The Montana sale was the first federal sale in the Powder River Basin in more than a decade. But the top bid was for less than a penny per ton. The federal government can only accept bids that are at or above “fair market value” and rejected the bid.

The scheduled Wyoming coal lease sale was postponed without a new date set.

As for generally bringing back economic growth and new energy development, Gianforte said Montana is encouraging it by loosening its tax structure – something opponents have said will only benefit higher income levels. According to Montana Free Press reporting, the Montana Entrepreneur Magnet Act “exempts shareholders of Montana-based businesses from paying capital gains taxes on stock options.”

The decision comes just five weeks after NextDecade announced a positive investment on a fourth liquefaction train at the Rio Grande LNG facility, reflecting shifting regulatory priorities and more rapid decisions by project developers.

President Donald Trump, on the day he was inaugurated, issued Executive Order 14154, “Unleashing American Energy,” which aims to streamline permitting processes on energy infrastructure development as a matter of national security.

The president’s order directed the Secretary of Energy to immediately resume reviews of all pending applications for LNG export projects to countries without a free-trade agreement with the U.S., reversing a year-long “pause” in regulatory approvals initiated by the Biden administration.

On August 29, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) issued a final order affirming an earlier determination that the Rio Grande LNG terminal including trains four and five was in the public interest, clearing the last major regulatory hurdle. FERC’s order came about three months before the previously scheduled release date, according to S&P Global.

NextDecade projects the total cost of Train 5 and related infrastructure at about $6.7 billion. Train 5 is commercially supported by 20-year supply agreements with JERA, EQT Corp, and ConocoPhillips for a total of 4.5 million tons of LNG each year, with deliveries expected in the first half of 2031.

The Rio Grande LNG facility has potential liquefaction capacity of approximately 48 million tons per year, according to NextDecade.

One graph showed the capacity factor at one location for August at , with the year so far showing an average of 14% output.

The concern: shouldn't that number, at least for summer, be much higher?

“Simply powering New York state with solar is just a large waste of land and a large waste of natural resources,"" said meteorology graduate Chris Martz, who is also a member of the Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow. ""Because I'm a land conservationist, I think we should have more natural landscape, more national parks. We should preserve that.""

Other farms show similar numbers, like Delaware River Solar, LLC on East River Road. Its capacity from February 2022 to November 2024 for electricity generated.

Martz said a good portion of the year in Upstate New York it can be overcast. He said solar on homes and businesses is a great idea, but large-scale solar projects? Not really. He said the average number for output varies, but seeing an average number in the 20s is about all you'll get at a maximum for our region.

""But on average, it's about 20% to 22% to 26% roughly,"" Martz said. ""That's probably a margin of error there.""

On its best day, he said, solar doesn’t match other energy sources like coal or nuclear.

""Solar power has the lowest power density,"" he said, adding, ""The amount of energy that solar generates is between 5.8 and 11.6 watts per square meter. And then coal power is 26.3 to 105.2, natural gas is 185 to 740, and nuclear fission is 228 to 760 watts per square meter of energy. That's just the power density, so solar is by far the lowest.""

Doreen Harris, president of the said New York actually leads the nation in solar power, producing about 7 gigawatts of combined distribution. She said It’s part of an energy portfolio to create a greener future and ease the energy load, adding solar projects and partnerships in the state can range from small to large-scale.

“We certainly do see a diversity of resources as being beneficial to New York's energy future,"" said Harris, adding, ""We're deploying many different technologies in order to get from here to there from the perspective of a reliable and affordable and clean grid.""

Harris said we will never have the same solar generation as say, Arizona or New Mexico, ""but we've really seen the ways in which this technology can continue to improve and benefit New Yorkers at the same time.""

She said the solar projects are actually a ""huge savings to New Yorkers during the heat waves this summer,” adding the amount came in at about $90 million.

Charlie Remelt owns 100 acres of farmland in Henrietta, and about a quarter of it is dedicated to solar and rented out to a company. As a farmer, he is still able to grow chrysanthemums between the panels, which can shift and move to draw in maximum sunlight. He said farms like his helps feed the strained summer grid.

“Air conditioners, air handlers, running those all draws a lot of lot of energy, and having that supplemental during that time of year is a big plus,"" he said.

Remelt added the town of Henrietta is very forward-thinking when it comes to green energy.

""Their farmland protection (allows) farmers to put solar on their property and generate some extra income to keep the properties from becoming all developed,"" he said.

Harris also said when it comes to solar, it is a major generator of jobs and billions of private investment.

""We have 178,000 clean energy workers,"" she said.

These jobs aren't just in demand — they're changing lives and providing a pathway for young people to build a future without debt.

Michael Lepinat is a service technician with C&C Heating and Air Conditioning. He says he found his path in the trades after realizing a traditional career just wasn't for him.

""I get to speak with people and work in a changing environment. I'm not stuck behind a desk all day, and I'm presented with different challenges each and every day that I get to overcome,"" Lepinat said.

""Being in a trade has been nothing but great in my life. I wouldn't be who I am today without it,"" Lepinat said.

Nationwide, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce estimates there are over 60,000 unfilled HVAC positions — a gap industry leaders hope young talent can help close.

Justin Coker is the service process manager and maintenance field supervisor at C&C who oversees all of the apprentices. He tells me the company invests heavily in training new talent, often fresh out of high school.

""Every person's a little bit different, but we want to make sure that when we're putting our technicians into people's homes, they feel confident, we feel confident, and the customer feels confident,"" Coker said.

Coker says he knows that journey firsthand.

""I started many years ago as a maintenance technician, quickly worked my way up through service and now into management, and then there's some guys that veer off into more of a sales role. There's some guys that just continue to do service until they retire,"" Coker said.

Instead, he found success through hard work and a career that continues to grow.

""You get what you give, and if you want to be the best somewhere, then there is gonna be some hard work and some long hours that you're gonna have to put in, but if it's something that you're truly dedicated to and that you love doing, it's worth it. The sky is the limit,"" Lepinat said.

North Carolina's Solar for All program, dubbed EnergizeNC, planned to install at least 43 megawatts of solar energy over five years.","North Carolina and 22 other states are suing the Environmental Protection Agency, seeking to reinstate a $7 billion program meant to help low-income and disadvantaged communities install rooftop solar power systems.

The Solar for All program was created in 2022 by the Inflation Reduction Act, with states and local governments required to apply to receive funds from the program. North Carolina's $156 million award would have helped put solar panels on more than 12,000 homes, according to N.C. Department of Environmental Quality officials.

But in August, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin canceled the program, before states could spend billions of dollars from it.

N.C. Attorney General Jeff Jackson and 22 of his colleagues are arguing the the EPA did not have the authority to cancel the program and rescind funds that had already been appropriated by the U.S. Congress for a specific purpose.

Furthermore, Jackson said, while the EPA pointed to this summer's Big Beautiful Bill as the impetus to slash Solar for All, Congress was clear that it did not intend to rescind Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund money that had already been obligated with that legislation.

""This is a pretty straightforward case from a legal standpoint. I think EPA just decided that they would rather not spend this money, and they're willing to act in defiance of Congress, and we're just going to go to court and point that out,"" Jackson said in an interview.

When EPA canceled Solar for All, North Carolina had yet to receive over $150 million of its fund. Jackson said the state was just weeks away from drawing that money down.

""We had already been awarded the funds. The funds were sitting in an account marked for our state,"" Jackson said.

In an Aug. 8 video announcing that the EPA was canceling the Solar for All program, Zeldin pointed to H.R. 1, the sweeping spending and tax legislation Congress passed this summer.

""But the bottom line again is this: EPA no longer has the authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive. With clear language and intent from Congress in the One Big Beautiful Bill, EPA is taking action to end this program for good,"" Zeldin said.

Jackson and the other attorneys general contend that Zeldin and EPA are misinterpreting what Congress intended under H.R. 1.

In fact, court filings say, members of Congress were very clear that any Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund awards that had already been obligated should be allowed to continue serving their originally intended purpose. Solar for All was part of that program.

The law itself says, ""Section 134 of the Clean Air Act ... is repealed and the unobligated balances of amounts made available to carry out that section ... are rescinded.""

And when the bill was being marked up before the House Energy and Commerce Committee's Subcommittee on the Environment in May, then-chair Rep. Morgan Griffiths, a Virginia Republican, said, ""These provisions that we are talking about only apply as far, as this bill is concerned, to the unobligated balances. So if a grant was already given, as far as this bill is concerned, then that would still be going forward.""

Impact in North Carolina

If Solar for All moved forward, state officials anticipate that it would help more than 12,000 households install solar panels, helping them save an average of 20% on utility bills. That's worth about $400 on average, according to the Clean Energy Fund of the Carolinas.

The N.C. Department of Environmental Quality also points to the potential for solar panels to be paired with storage systems, providing energy to a home in the case of a prolonged power outage.

""The program’s cancellation would hurt the electric grid’s ability to be resilient to future disasters, and would hamper North Carolina’s efforts to ensure reliable, clean and affordable energy supplies to meet the needs of a rapidly growing population and rising energy demand,"" DEQ Secretary Reid Wilson said in a statement.

North Carolina's Solar for All program, dubbed EnergizeNC, planned to install at least 43 megawatts of solar energy over five years. It would have focused on single family homes, as well as multifamily housing, homes where residents have medical needs and some community solar pilot programs.

""EnergizeNC was primed to deploy a pilot program for home solar and battery backup that would offer back-up power during grid outages for households with medical equipment needs. That battery backup equipment would do double-duty by helping utilities manage the electric grid on very hot or very cold days, when power needs surge,"" Melissa Malkin-Weber, the executive co-director of the Clean Energy Fund of the Carolinas, said in a statement.

The program was also expected to create about 140 jobs in North Carolina, with many of those concentrated in rural areas.

The 23 states challenging the EPA's cancellation of Solar for All filed two separate claims on Wednesday.

In the Western District of Washington, they argued that the EPA 's cancellation of the program violated the Administrative Procedure Act and U.S. Constitution's Separation of Powers Doctrine. States are asking the court to declare the EPA's interpretation of H.R. 1 unlawful and to reinstate the Solar for All program.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f5429f0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4240x2226+0+303/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F20%2Fa4%2Fba587f9d4defab7b23f11fdd3d26%2Fap25183566192370.jpg,N,,2025-10-17 18:02:49.113821

Today, the Trump EPA is announcing that we are ending Solar for All for good, saving US taxpayers ANOTHER $7 BILLION!","24 states on Thursday commenced a lawsuit against the Trump administration for cancelling a $7 billion solar grant which would have brought solar energy to more than 900,000 low-income families across the country.

The complaint alleges that the termination of the grant program, Solar for All, contravened the contracts between the EPA and the plaintiffs, stating :

The EPA’s unilateral terminations breached the express terms of Plaintiffs’ Grant Agreements, which allowed for termination only in the narrow circumstances of substantial noncompliance that materially impairs performance, adequate evidence of waste, fraud or abuse, or material misrepresentation of eligibility status—none of which occurred.

The complaint also argues that the EPA breached its duty of good faith and fair dealing by “destroy[ing] Plaintiffs’ reasonable expectations regarding the fruits of their Grant Agreements.” Additionally, in a partner lawsuit filed in the Western District of Washington, plaintiffs allege violations of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), contending that the termination was arbitrary and capricious.

California Attorney General Rob Bonta reported California’s decision to join the coalition on Wednesday, condemning the grant termination:

At a time when energy bills are at a record high and only continuing to skyrocket, the Trump Administration is needlessly hampering an industry that can produce safe, reliable, and inexpensive energy. Solar for All was built to deliver relief for all Americans — by lowering energy bills for working families, reducing our carbon footprint, and creating high-quality union jobs that would bolster our economy. We will not let this illegal termination of the Solar for All Program stand. This Administration can try all they want to bend the law, but we will hold them accountable.

By February 2025, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) had entered into binding grant agreements with members of each of the 24 plaintiff states. In August, the EPA declared the cancellation of the Solar for All program and began withdrawing funds from the plaintiffs’ accounts. Lee Zeldin, Administrator of the EPA, announced the move on social media, stating:

In some cases, your tax dollars were diluted through up to FOUR pass-through entities, each taking their own cut off the top! The bottom line is this: EPA no longer has the statutory authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive.

Welcome to CleanLaw from the Environmental and Energy Law Program at Harvard Law School. I’m Hannah Perls, and in this episode I speak with environmental justice pioneer Charles Lee, former director of EPA’s Environmental Justice Office and principal author of the landmark 1987 report, Toxic Wastes and Race in the United States, and now a visiting scholar at Howard University School of Law. We’re also joined by Sean Moriarty, former deputy commissioner with the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection.

We discuss the growing field of cumulative impacts analysis and how states are increasingly using this tool in permitting and other programs to advance meaningful protections for overburdened communities across the country. And we should note both Sean and Charles are speaking in their personal capacity and their opinions and views in no way represent the views of their respective institutions. Well, Charles, Sean, thank you both so much for being on CleanLaw.

So a lot of our recent episodes have focused on these big changes to federal environmental law and policy, but today we’re going to shift gears and talk about what I think are some really exciting developments happening at the state level to protect public health and the environment by incorporating cumulative impacts’ analysis into government decision-making and in particular permitting. Now, before we dive in just two to three sentences, what is cumulative impacts analysis and why does it matter? Maybe Charles, we can start with you.

Charles Lee:

First of all, thank you for having me on the podcast. Cumulative impacts speak to the interaction between multiple environmental health and social stressors and their effects on human health, welfare, and quality of life. Cumulative impacts is really about the concentration of environmental and social burdens in certain areas. So places like the Ironbound community in Newark, New Jersey or the South Side of Chicago or Cancer Alley in Louisiana. And it is something that while many communities that are overburdened aren’t familiar with the term, they really know all the issues involved because this really reflects their lived reality.

Hannah Perls:

Sean, is there anything you would add?

Sean Moriarty:

Sure, I would love to add to that, just love adding anything to what Charles says. It’s an extreme pleasure in my life to work with this man. I think the only thing I would add, is that when you’re looking at cumulative impacts from the regulatory perspective, and certainly the way that I come to this, having spent time at New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection. I think what cumulative impacts attempts to do is really to account for impacts that are missed when you look at things through traditional media-based permitting approaches. So those media-based approaches, which is, for example, air or water, they’re more narrowly crafted and they look at specific impacts that any given facility has, but they don’t really consider the context in which those facilities exist.

So when Charles mentions the Ironbound community in Newark or the South Side of Chicago or these places, our traditional approach to permitting doesn’t consider the proximity of these facilities necessarily to vulnerable populations and particularly kind of their abundance or concentration in certain areas during permitting. And what cumulative impacts attempts to do is to take a broader view of these things and I think a more complete view of the impacts that facilities have and try to, through some of the various statutory and regulatory approaches that we’re seeing across the country, to try to remedy or remediate some of those disproportionate impacts.

Charles Lee:

So there’s a term that’s always used when people talk about cumulative impacts, which is talking about total burden. And so I think this is what Sean is speaking to. The idea here is to the extent that we can, we want to take into account all those burdens, particularly those that we normally don’t capture, either because of the regulations or because of the way that we currently do the analysis.

Hannah Perls:

I really appreciate that, and I think for a lot of our listeners, they’ll be familiar with the federal frameworks, which often think about pollutants either on a source by source basis or even a pollutant by pollutant basis. And what I hear you both talking about, and I think the way that we all experience pollution in our daily lives where this is sort of intuitive and common sense. We don’t experience just particulate matter and just lead in the water or in lead paint. We experience all of those things collectively. And then the impact will depend on who we are. It might depend on how much money we have. It might depend on our pre-existing vulnerabilities. So this is about taking that holistic view that better represents people’s reality.

And I wanted to pull out something you both said, which is you have the analysis itself that gives you that sense of what people are living in, in terms of the pollution or the background stressors, which we will get into. But then there’s also how you operationalize it. And I think, Charles, this is something that you’ve said that this research must go beyond merely proving existence of disproportionality. So I think a real focus of this conversation is once you have that assessment, how do you operationalize it? And in particular, how do you do that through legal frameworks? And in particular, permitting, which is the real example we have out of New Jersey.

And I do want to just tell our listeners a bit more about who you both are because I am extremely excited to have you both on the podcast given your expertise and experience. Charles, I want to start with you. So you of course are recognized as one of the foremost national experts on this cumulative impacts issue and a longtime participant and leader in the environmental justice movement in the United States. And just for listeners who might not be familiar with your work, you left EPA this year after 26 years with the agency to join the Environmental and Climate Justice Center at Howard University School of Law as a visiting scholar.

And of course, before joining EPA, you worked as an advocate and a researcher, notably as the principal author of Toxic Wastes and Race in the United States, this landmark 1987 report. And you helped organize the First National People of Color Environmental Leadership Summit in 1991. And this is an abbreviated biography. Charles, I’m just very, very grateful to you for being on this podcast and sharing your expertise with us. I wanted to ask you, as your decades of work show, this is not a new idea. The concept and assessment of cumulative impacts is ingrained in many of our federal environmental statutes. But I want to know how you started working on this issue and then if there’s anything that you’re seeing now in this moment that feels new.

Charles Lee:

Thanks for the question. I think this issue of cumulative impacts has always been part of the environmental justice conversation. It’s very natural because when we talk about environmental justice, we’re really talking about the lived reality or the lived experience of communities. And so as we said before, we don’t experience pollution one at a time. We experience it holistically. We live with all these pollution and other factors all at the same time. So this is really part of that conversation. So I think at the very beginning of when environmental justice emerged as an issue of national concern, this issue of cumulative impacts just kind of naturally grew up along with it.

For example, the National Environmental Justice Advisory Council, which is EPA’s formal advisory council on environmental justice, had its very first meeting in 1993, the issue got raised. And now virtually in every meeting since then, the issue gets raised over and over again. And just the way that people understand this issue and the ways to deal with the issue has evolved over the several decades that environmental justice has been on the national stage. It is not true that cumulative impacts that we’re just beginning to address this in government decision making. It’s been part of the conversation on that level for many years.

And in fact, going back to around 2010, 2012, California developed a cumulative impact mapping tool that now is used for allocating resources to the areas which are most overburdened. And that’s something that has been done in other states like New York and Illinois and during the Biden administration, that is what the Justice40 Initiative is all about, which calls for 40% of the benefits of a class of environmental and health programs that must go to benefit overburdened communities.

Hannah Perls:

Charles, one thing that you mentioned, I just want to pull out a little bit, is you talked about a lot of different ways that cumulative impacts analysis has been operationalized in state and federal programs. And I think there’s a helpful three-part framework that the Tishman Center at the New School offers, which is they group them into sort of three buckets and you touched on all three buckets, but just to sort of make that clear for listeners. One is this analytical function, just understanding how these disproportionate burdens map out. And so that is sort of what you were talking about with CalEnviroScreen, that mapping tool. Another is this redistributive mechanism, right?

We’re going to use this information to better understand how we can equitably allocate public resources to make sure people who are most impacted get the resources and investments they need. And that would be Justice40. And then I think, Sean, this is a great segue to your expertise. That third bucket is this regulatory operationalizing function where you actually integrate this analysis into how agencies make decisions. And of course, Sean, this is your expertise with the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection. So I’m going to provide you a brief introduction so our listeners have a sense of who you are and the expertise that you bring.

You, of course, come to this as a former state regulatory lawyer, which is a very specific type of lawyering.

Sean Moriarty:

Yes, it is.

Hannah Perls:

And I think our listeners would also love to hear a bit more about what does that mean to be a regulatory lawyer? But in particular, I think what’s really exciting about your expertise is you were one of the lead attorneys at the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection when the agency was tasked with implementing New Jersey’s landmark 2020 environmental justice law, which included a very explicit and complex cumulative impacts mandate that needed to be integrated into the state’s permitting program. So can you share just a little bit as we flagged, what does it mean to be a regulatory lawyer and then a little bit about that work in particular implementing the EJ law?

Sean Moriarty:

Sure. So first of all, putting my bio up next to Charles’ is kind of insane, right? Charles is going to do a whole book talking about where he comes from, and I can do my entire origin story in about two minutes. So I’m going to do that. So I worked for the state and I would say truly the best thing that ever happened to me in terms of changing kind of a professional trajectory to something that I think is really much more meaningful than what I might’ve otherwise been able to do. So I’d worked for the state for a good decade or so, and I was very fortunate to work my way up through the DEP to become the deputy commissioner and general counsel. And that’s like dream job scenario for me for any kind of regulatory lawyer.

You think that that’s unattainable in your little space and then you get a couple of lucky breaks and you find yourself in a position of great privilege honestly. So early in my tenure in that job as deputy commissioner, I was asked to take part in this meeting with community members from the Ironbound Community Corp on an issue. It was related to environmental compliance reviews for facilities eligible for renewable energy credits. At the time, did not think it was that big of a deal, to be honest with you. So met with staff, we prepared our fairly standard response, which if you’ve ever dealt with government, it’s probably not going to be all that fulfilling when you hear it.

And went to the meeting thinking that this would be kind of my typical interaction with advocates who’ve dealt with people repeatedly over the years and felt like I had a sense of what to expect. Very quickly realized that was not the case. So after giving kind of the department’s response, one of the community members, I’m not going to name her, but she’s very well known and a very powerful voice in this space, immediately and forcefully told me that I should be fired. And if you’ve never thought you were doing your job and thought you were doing it well, and then were told very directly that you did not deserve to sit in that position, I would recommend it because it really pushes you back and it makes you have to reconsider why you’re there.

So while that wasn’t the first time, and definitely not the last time I’d been yelled at as a state worker, this was different, right? There was an urgency and kind of, I don’t even know what the right word is, a power behind those words.

Hannah Perls:

That sort of moral imperative.

Sean Moriarty:

I wasn’t prepared for that, and I hadn’t felt that in these meetings before. So perhaps initially just out of self-preservation, we regrouped, we changed our tune, and went back to the drawing board on this. And over the next several months we worked to find what I felt was a better solution. But ultimately we were much more transparent, much more open about what our constraints were, what we could do, what we couldn’t do. And I think we found better common ground on the issue. And luckily for me, I kept my job. So what I took from that were really two lessons. First, that the department can and should do better in these spaces.

And secondly, that in my position, instead of just getting the information and delivering it, I had the ability to influence better outcomes. So while I’ve never confirmed that this is the case, I’m pretty certain that my handling of that issue was at least part of why our then commissioner, Catherine McCabe, came to me and said, “I think you need to be the person to handle this rule making process.” When the state environmental justice law was passed. So with those lessons, we began this process of engagement, and a big part of that process was a continuous and direct conversation with the community members and advocates who had championed the bill. This was their law.

They had worked they decades to get it passed. And I think that’s part of thinking about how we can do things better and how we can do things differently, was to talk to them directly every two weeks for the entirety of our rulemaking process. And in our first meeting, which was fun times during the height of COVID, so all this is happening on the computer. I just went in and just openly admitted that I am probably somebody who looks a lot like the people you interacted before that you felt let you down. And what I would never do in that situation is I would never ask them to trust me because that would not work. So what we committed to, I specifically and the rest of our team, is that we would work to earn their trust through this process.

And to make this slightly long story, slightly shorter, we got the rules done and the person who wanted me fired some five years later, we now count each other as friends, and we’re still trying to find ways to collaborate together. And to me, if you’re a regulatory lawyer in this space or any other space, I think the lessons there are at least pretty clear to me that you’re going to get a lot farther by being transparent, by being genuine, by being real with folks, letting them know what you can and can’t do, and ultimately working to earn that trust as opposed to just sitting there and being a bureaucrat. And I think that type of approach that we adopted as a department is really what helped us to be able to be successful in putting this rule together, in getting it adopted, and ultimately working on the implementation.

And I think that was a big deal for me. It really kind of changed the way that I approached all of this, and then I quit DEP and then Charles came calling and said, “Hey, let’s do some more of this work together.” And I said, “Yeah.” And I made a bunch of changes and now we’re here doing this podcast. So it’s all pretty cool.

Hannah Perls:

I think that’s another good universal rule. If Charles Lee asks you to do something, you do it.

Sean Moriarty:

Yes. The answer is always yes.

Hannah Perls:

The answer is always yes.

Charles Lee:

Can I add something to that?

Hannah Perls:

Absolutely.

Charles Lee:

So as part of the process that Sean led was a stakeholder engagement process that was, I think, in my mind, not just excellent, but really educational. And so they did a number of stakeholder meetings, which are recorded, and on the New Jersey DEP website, there’s a whole encyclopedia of all the recordings and you hear the advocates. And these were not just advocates, but the communities and other stakeholders all engaging with Sean and other members of New Jersey DEP over really substantive issues. And what you listen to if you listen carefully, is how these issues are worked through, not just in terms of what’s important to the communities involved, but what is practicable under the kind of laws and regulations that DEP has to work with.

So it is really an educational thing. And what I think I would draw from that is this has been this conversation in the environmental justice space about how environmental justice is not just a procedural matter, it has been to a large extent, still happening in many cases, is that government agencies would just hold a meeting and then they would check the box. There’s this is Fourth Circuit opinion about the Atlantic Coast Pipeline, where it basically says environmental justice is not a check-the-box exercise. And so moving beyond that to addressing these issues substantively is I think the heart of what the New Jersey DEP process is all about.

And I think that stands as a real hallmark as far as something that’s truly valuable that this whole process brings to good governance and to transparency and meaningful involvement.

Sean Moriarty:

Thank you for highlighting that, Charles. So I would always tell people, if you’re a glutton for punishment, you can watch all those videos because it’s a full day’s worth. I’m not joking, 24 hours of just my bald floating head talking about environmental justice stuff. But in all seriousness, I think that comes back to this idea that in doing this work, it’s okay to approach things differently, that it deserves a better approach. It deserves more because we’re trying to correct longstanding historical inequities. And that you can’t do that by just using the same approach and the same modus operandi that you always use. It has to be different. It has to be focused. If we’re going to talk that talk, we had to walk the walk.

So we did eight months of stakeholdering with everybody. We broke it down piece by piece, every single decision that we made there. And it didn’t mean that we were going to just do what everybody told us to do, but what we were going to do is sit there and take the time to explain exactly why we felt we wanted to move in a different direction, get feedback on that, present proposals. So before the rule was ever proposed, before things were finalized, everyone involved in that process had a really, really clear and strong understanding of what the rule was going to say. There were no surprises when the thing came out.

Charles Lee:

One thing maybe to add to that is that what I found really helpful for me was the idea that those conversations were really problem-solving conversations. That the whole way that the development of those regulations was approached was that it was a trying to solve problems and not just solve problems alone, but collectively.

Hannah Perls:

We’ve just been saying and using the words disproportionality, burden, stressors. And one thing this law is really trying to get at is the historical legacy of often governmental choices that decided where polluting facilities would be sited or decided where we would invest public dollars to build out sewer or wastewater infrastructure. And each state has its unique context, not just in terms of its current industrial mix, but also the particular communities that were excluded from democratic processes or excluded from the benefits of environmental decision making.

And so Charles, obviously, as one of the people who first documented this in that 1987 report, I was wondering if you could just talk a bit about how you understand disproportionality and why it’s so important that we not just understand it, but operationalize it in the way we make decisions now.

Charles Lee:

Thanks for that. I mean, I think one of the things that 1987 Toxic Wastes and Race report did was to really bring evidence to bear about this idea that environmental burdens and benefits, that there’s a distributional aspect to that. And this has been built upon in the 40, 50 years since then with a whole explosion of research. I mean, there’s probably thousands of peer reviewed journal articles in all aspects related to environment, health, sustainability, climate and transportation, healthcare, green space. And as you pointed out, it also offers us a way to understand not just what is, but how it got there.

So a great example of this would be the issue of redlining in the 1930s and all the research that’s being done ever since the University of Richmond digitized the redlining maps in the 1930s and the research that began to correlate our current environmental and health conditions with what grade you were in terms of the 1930s HOLC Maps, H-O-L-C, redlining maps.

Hannah Perls:

That was the Home Owners Loan Corporation, H-O-L-C?

Charles Lee:

That’s right. Home Owners Loan Corporation. And so it’s really remarkable to see that areas which were deemed the worst or the least desirable areas that ended up being areas where we disinvested in are the places that have the highest asthma rates or the greatest temperature rise. There’s heat islands and lack of tree cover, and these relationships really help to explain why current environmental conditions are the way they are today. And I think that the larger question behind all this is that in our environmental analysis and decision making process, we really need to think more about the distribution of environmental benefits and burdens.

Hannah Perls:

So I want to get to what that final product is because now we sort of built up and built up and built up all the anticipation.

Sean Moriarty:

Excitement is off the charts.

Hannah Perls:

This is a very extended movie trailer for the New Jersey DEP rules. And I want to start to dig into the complexity of the really concrete decision points that the regulators made as part of this engagement process. And I should say that, Sean, you and I and another one of our colleagues, Sarah Hart-Curren, we are working on a forthcoming legal guide that will just lay out the legal considerations for integrating cumulative impacts analysis into state permitting. So we’re not going to get into sort of the science and methodology of cumulative impacts analysis. There are a ton of really amazing resources. A lot of this is Charles’s work and his colleagues like Paul Mohai and others.

I want to talk about the legal framework. So if you’re a regulator and you’re starting from the authorizing statutory language, right? The New Jersey legislature says to New Jersey DEP, “Do this thing.” Sean, can you talk a little bit about what you saw as sort of the crucial decision points in designing this program and how you as a regulator look at statutory language and come out with a rulemaking process that as you said isn’t just process for process’s sake? It’s going to deliver concrete protections consistent with what the legislature demanded.

Sean Moriarty:

Sure. That sounds great. What the law kind of requires is it requires the department to consider how certain specific facilities operating in what we call overburdened communities, and those are set by specific demographic criteria, are going to contribute to environmental public health stressors in a way that is, as we term it, disproportionate when compared to what I would say is its neighbors, right? So what you’re doing is you’re looking at environmental conditions in specifically identified communities and trying to figure out if they are worse essentially than other communities. And what it allows you to do is consider those impacts on a facility-wide basis as opposed to the kind of more narrow way you would look at it.

If you’re looking at it from an air pollution perspective, you’re looking at stack emissions, or if you’re looking at it from water pollution perspective, you’re looking at a point source emission. This allows the department to consider things much more broadly on a facility-wide basis. And that lets you get at things that you can’t otherwise get at through traditional environmental permitting structures, particularly trying to address mobile sources and their impacts on PM2.5, diesel particulate matter. Some of these things that really affect quality of life in overburdened communities that we didn’t have the tools to really address previously. So when you ask what the big decision points are, the statute gives us some guidance.

It tells us what facilities to look at, largely solid waste facilities, major air sources. It tells us what communities to consider. We need to figure out, “Well, first and foremost, how do you do that in comparison?” And we do so by defining specific environmental and public health stressors. So we had a list from the statute that includes concentrated areas of pollution, mobile sources, sites, and then other things that may cause, being a critical term “may cause,” public health impacts, including asthma, cancer, elevated above levels, a bunch of things, right? We needed to be able to plot those out with data for the entirety of the state. So we had to look at a bunch of different data sources.

We started with 60, we ended with about 26. 26 pieces of data that would inform those statutory categories, those statutory stressor categories. Our goal in doing so was to use as much publicly available and kind of reliable data as possible, feeling that that would give us a more objective baseline upon which to begin to evaluate facility contributions. And setting that baseline is really, really important to ultimately determining whether just proportionality exists. So we created through that process the Environmental Justice, Mapping, Assessment, and Protection Tool or EJMAP.

And what that does is ultimately plots out the relative stressor levels for all of the communities in the state of New Jersey, the overburdened communities and non-overburdened communities, and then allows us to do a comparative analysis of those stressors between communities. And then for any of those individual stressors where the presence in an overburdened community is higher than it would otherwise be in a non-overburdened community, those are considered “adverse.” We’re able to sum those up through what we call the matrix method. So you could take each of the individual stressors, you can make a determination about whether they are higher than what you would see in non-overburdened communities.

And then you add those up and that gives us kind of an overall assessment of disproportionality across all of those communities. That’s the biggest and most crucial decision point. From there, what we really ask of facilities is to simply address their contributions to those stressors, particularly where they’re disproportionate. So through that process, you have a baseline assessment, you have an assessment of disproportionality, the department does all that work, makes that available, and then a facility comes in, and they have to make decisions about what they are or not going to be able to do to address their contributions.

In that way, I think it takes a fairly complex concept and makes it pretty simple and something that based on a chart that you can pull down from EJMAP, you can really understand exactly what the environmental conditions are in a particular community. And as a facility or as a community member, then you can start to make decisions on how you can work to lessen those areas of disproportionality or adversity. I think it’s a really, really powerful way to look at it and data being really the backbone and the critical component to that. That really unlocks a lot of the other aspects of the law that ultimately can work to lessen those impacts.

Hannah Perls:

Sean, I just want to emphasize one more part of the New Jersey program, there’s really crucial clear statutory language in the New Jersey law that requires New Jersey DEP to deny a permit if certain thresholds are met. So if you could imagine a community where you have an elementary school and there’s a facility that’s already there and it wants to expand and expanding that facility would mean that that community bears a much higher disproportionate pollution load cumulatively. New Jersey under the law, the DEP now has very concrete mandates about what to do in that situation. So I was wondering if you could briefly explain how that works.

And then Charles, I’m going to ask you why we don’t just copy and paste the New Jersey law for all the other 49 states.

Sean Moriarty:

So I think one of the aspects of the law that is important to understand is the difference in authorities with regard to denials. So the original version of the bill, and this is probably one of the reasons why you don’t just cut and paste it because you maybe could do a little bit better. But the original version of the bill would’ve had mandatory denials when you are causing a disproportionate impact. So impacting a community in a way that is going to make it have disproportionate burdens or is going to further exacerbate existing and disproportionate burdens. That was changed.

And the way that the law works now is that the department only has the authority and in fact has the mandate to deny permits for new facilities that are going to cause disproportionate impact unless they will meet the compelling public interest standard. So for those facilities, if you are seeking to site a new facility in the community you described, that’s already subject to significant adverse burdens, unless the facility can completely avoid contributions to those adverse burdens, it is denied unless it meets compelling public interest standard and that’s drawn narrowly. It focuses on really kind of critical public health or environmental needs of the community.

And I think when you’re thinking about critical statutory terminology when, in the definition of compelling public interest, it specifically uses the words “in the overburdened community.” I think that we highlighted that, we underlined it, we put it in different color every time we did a presentation because when you’re scoping out what that looks like, centering the needs of the community is absolutely critical to avoid continued kind of exacerbation of historic inequities.

Hannah Perls:

I think we’ve been using a lot of big terms, but I think this is fundamentally a public health bill. And when we talk about denying new facilities, it is a recognition that that contribution would dramatically impede people’s public health. Is that accurate?

Sean Moriarty:

Without question. We talk about reality, we talk about lived experience, all that stuff. It’s like what is it like to go outside your house? If you live in some of these communities that are considered overburdened that we’ve kind of mapped out and have not only meet specific demographic criteria but also have increased environmental and public health burdens. You might be walking outside of your house and you might see diesel trucks going to the nearby solid waste facility the entire day and how that impacts your quality of life.

They might technically raise particular levels of a particular pollutant, but at the end of the day, it’s like what does that feel like to live there and can we do better to make it so when people walk outside the air that they breathe is cleaner and that the water that they find around the corner in the stream is not incredibly dirty and all of the things that some of us are fortunate enough to take it for advantage. So you deny those facilities when it’s going to further impact the quality of life. For existing facilities, and one of the changes to the bill is that the department can only condition those permits.

So if an existing facility or that facility that is next to the elementary school that’s expanding, they effectively under the law have a right to expand. The department in turn has a right to impose additional conditions on that expansion that are intended to, and we set this out in the regulations. We set a hierarchy of avoidance, minimization, and in certain situations, net environmental benefit that requires a facility to go through and assess its impacts to those stressors and look at all feasible ways that they can avoid those impacts. And if they can’t avoid them, then they need to minimize them.

And if you’re expanding, then you need to do something else for the community to try to address the fact that an expansion that increases contributions to public health stressors, we are accepting that that is going to increase a level of disproportionality. So in that situation, what the rules ask is that if we’re going to accept that and we are going to agree that you can do that, then we’re going to ask you to do something else to try to reduce elsewhere because we can’t get around the fact that you’re adding. And to us, and to me, that was critical because you got to think about what the goals of the law ultimately are.

Preventing new facilities is a good and laudable goal, but how you deal with those existing facilities to me is just as critical because if you’re going to improve conditions over the long term, you’re ultimately going to need to reduce the contributions from those facilities. And that’s what we really sought to do through the regulatory process, is to drive those down at each renewal iteration or each expansion to try to minimize as best we could what those impacts would be. And hopefully over the long term see significant lessening of that documented disproportionality.

Hannah Perls:

I should say, it’s not prevent all new facilities, it’s preventing facilities that have negative public health consequences in areas that already are experiencing significant public health burdens and making sure that we don’t make it even worse, if that is fair.

Sean Moriarty:

That is very fair.

Charles Lee:

When I was at EPA and we would bring Sean over to present under New Jersey DEP’s regulations and methodology, and all the attorneys at EPA would say, one thing about this that really stands out in my mind. They called it, it was an approach that was elegantly simple, that it was really easy to see and to implement. To me one of the things that… It doesn’t have to be that complex. That you could do it in a way that’s legally and scientifically defensible and be very straightforward. So I think that’s one thing that we take away, lessons from what happened in New Jersey, that would be one of them in terms of what kind of tool or what kind of analysis method that we’re striving for that it’d be elegantly simple.

Sean Moriarty:

And I think on that point, so this is a cumulative impacts titled podcast. When Charles describes what that means, he talks about interactions of chemicals and how that affects inherent or population-based vulnerabilities. I think it’s important to distinguish what we did in New Jersey in our now called matrix approach from a true cumulative impacts analysis. It is not that. It does not attempt to account for the interactions of those chemicals in the air or in the water. It does not attempt to necessarily account for how those specific mixtures of chemicals will affect folks based on their vulnerabilities.

All it does is attempt to look at, we talked about this earlier, what is the reality of environmental and public health conditions in a particular community? And then it works to try to address those. So one of the big points of pushback in earlier department efforts to try to address cumulative impacts and ultimately was hanging over the idea of actually passing a bill in 2020, was whether you could actually do this. Because at that time, and things have advanced, and there’s reports coming out even yesterday showing how it kind of a true cumulative impacts analysis that work is advancing. At the time, now five years ago, there were people who could credibly say, “You actually can’t do this.”

And if you can’t do it, then what’s the point of passing a law that says you should? And what we were able to do, and I’ll give a lot of credit to folks like Steve Anderson, Sherry Driver who worked at the department for years and years and years on this work, quietly behind the scenes in their extra time. When we were negotiating the bill, they were able to show proof of concept on these things. They were able to say, “We know where all these facilities are and can plot them out based on this demographic criteria. We can show you that most of your major air facilities are concentrated in very specific places.”

And I think that the work that you do to carefully consider the data, carefully consider how you want to quantify these things, is really important in how it will ultimately be translated into regulation, into operation.

Hannah Perls:

You mentioned a report that came out yesterday. So we’re going to link to the report that just came out from the National Academies on cumulative impacts analysis, which we should say Charles played a part in. Charles, we’ve been talking about a lot of concepts that you’ve pioneered and I want to lift those up. So one piece I think as we look at other states that have adopted cumulative impacts programs or have bills moving through their legislature, and there’s a significant number. We have I think eight states that have cumulative impact requirements in their permitting program specifically, and then an additional 10 states that have bills moving that would adopt a similar framework.

And I think a common question is, well, why don’t we just copy and paste the New Jersey bill? And the response is this “fit for purpose” framework that you’ve pioneered. And so I just want to have you explain that a little bit. What does that mean and what are the different decision contexts that people should think about when they’re trying to apply this framework to their particular situation?

Charles Lee:

Thanks for that. I’ll try to do a good job on this.

Hannah Perls:

And I will say, to your research, I’m asking you to explain a lifetime of work in five minutes.

Charles Lee:

Well, first of all, I mean this idea of fit for purpose, I think it has been in the public health environmental analysis literature, it’s been in the risk assessment literature. And I came across it when I was thinking about how the environmental justice analysis has come about and evolved. And so I guess you can define this as that different types of decisions may require, probably will require different types of analysis, different types of data, different combinations of quantitative and qualitative analysis, different degrees of quantification to inform them. And what we want to do is not just to do an analysis for its own sake, but to inform decisions. So the analysis should be tailored to the decisions that we’re trying to make.

And so in the environmental justice space, when we first started to develop EJ mapping tools like CalEnviroScreen and US EPA’s EJSCREEN, we did this with the idea of just trying to identify places where you can go to do more outreach or analysis, and we never thought of it as something that can be used for any purpose other than that. And then what happened in California was that a law was passed as Senate Bill 535, that called for 25% of the proceeds of the greenhouse gas reduction fund in the state to benefit what they call disadvantaged communities. And CalEPA decided to use CalEnviroScreen to make those determinations.

And for me what that meant was that some of these tools that we originally developed that we didn’t know could be used for these type of purposes, it turned out that these tools can in fact be used for making very impactful decisions like where you allocate resources. And in California that has amounted to billions of dollars that goes into the communities where they are most in need, the most overburdened, and underserved communities. And that of course has been replicated in other states and became the approach behind the Justice40 Initiative during the Biden administration. But the kind of tools that are going to be necessary for a more regulatory context like permits or rules are probably going to be different.

And we’re seeing these emerge now with New Jersey DEP’s approach in terms of its cumulative impacts and methodology. Again, in the context of your question, different states are going to have different kind of statutory language, and out of that, you’re going to have to develop methods and regulations to suit those statutory goals. I think it’s fair to say that in Massachusetts the approach is somewhat different. It’s much more of a threshold-based, risk-based approach that’s based on health endpoints. And so we don’t need to get into all of that, but that is just to say that there are different approaches emerging even in the permit space.

And I think when we get to national rules, the kind of analysis, the scaled analysis, and the kind of data that’s going to be necessary, and the kind of questions you’re going to have to answer are going to be different. So it’s important to note that cumulative impact analysis is not just one thing, and the key to understanding how to make it so that it is practicable is to understand the decision context and to understand that you can tailor your analysis to suit those decision contexts. So there is a conversation that took place when EPA went to the Science Advisory Board, and I think this is back in 2021, 2022.

When around the recommendations, the Office of Research and Development’s recommendations around cumulative impacts research, and the members of the SAB all said, “This is a really laudable exercise.” But that it was nearly impossible except for one person, Dr. Kristi Pullen Fedinick who said, “It may seem that way, but actually if you start to understand the idea that you have decision context and you can tailor analysis to various decision contexts, then it becomes something you can get your hands around.”

Sean Moriarty:

I’m in love with Charles’s fit for purpose approach. When you think through the different implications of practicality, defensibility, all those things, and how different approaches, single score method out of California, or matrix method out of New Jersey, or risk-based thresholds out of Massachusetts, all of those are valid ways to do this. They all come with different risks, different practicalities, and you can kind of see when you plot them out on that fit for purpose continuum, you can see how they fit together and how they can be used to advance different but at times maybe concurrent priorities.

The other thing about… joke, of course, everybody’s should copy New Jersey because I’m from New Jersey, but I think it’s just important to know every state has communities that have specific needs and specific concerns. So there may be some broad validity to the idea that the approach we took in New Jersey can be kind of operationalized and used other places. But at the end of the day, what this requires, if we’re going to really address cumulative impacts, and we’re going to address these quality of life issues that we’re talking about, is you need to understand the specific types of stressors that are of concern in the communities within your given state, municipality, wherever.

And you need to understand what the types of facilities that are most of concern. So I wouldn’t cut and paste our list of facilities to everywhere else because I don’t think that would be valid, but I do think there are parts to this. There are principles at play that can be useful, but ultimately those things got to be crafted, I think, to meet the needs of the communities. And I think that will have better outcomes, but we can offer perspective and understanding of the tools that are available to folks to try to get at those outcomes.

Hannah Perls:

There’s a menu and you can sort of lay out what’s on the menu and then folks can sort of pick a la carte, what makes the most sense for them in their state.

Charles Lee:

Because the whole point of all this is not just to do the analysis, but it is to utilize them in terms of better decisions.

Sean Moriarty:

And on that menu, how those things interplay is important too. You might not want to select pineapple on pizza because that’s disgusting.

Hannah Perls:

Wow, hard take.

Sean Moriarty:

But those things might be great in other contexts, just maybe not combined all the time.

Hannah Perls:

It’s a very specific take. We might get our first hate mail from people who love Hawaiian pizza. So thanks for that, Sean. As we flagged this is a really exciting and sort of quickly moving tool in terms of seeing states in particular operationalize cumulative impacts analysis in their permitting programs. And so the last question I want to ask you both is if someone is coming to you saying, “We’re really excited about this idea. I’m living in X State, where do I start?” Or they’re coming to you to say, “I’ve looked at New Jersey’s program, I understand it, but I’m trying to figure out what am I not seeing? What am I missing?”

Are there any resources or people or ideas that you would want to make sure you point them towards as they go about this process?

Sean Moriarty:

I think some of the work that Charles has been doing, and I’ve been fortunate to work in collaboration with him on, it’s like trying to build a community of practice around this work and bringing together people with the experience and the perspectives and the understanding and how you define these issues, how you advocate for these issues, and ultimately how you operationalize permitting solutions in the long term. I think that approach is really, really critical to anybody who’s interested in this. If somebody came to me the first thing, I would want to make sure that either they were from the impacted communities or we’re speaking with them. I think that’s the first part.

This has to be driven by folks in those communities. You got to first start there, identify the concerns, and talk to folks and have them drive the bus on this. But I think the work that we’re doing now is to try to create a support system for folks who are on that bus and who want to see these things in their state. And I think you look at the work we did in New Jersey, you look at the work they did in Massachusetts, or look at the ongoing work in New York, Minnesota, Connecticut, you can see how these things are playing out. Everybody’s in different stages. Everybody has slightly different statute, slightly different approach, but all kind of aimed at the same goal of reducing these disproportionalities.

I think by engaging with those folks, by talking to them, by understanding what’s happening in other states and taking advantage of the resources, I think that can help to provide folks with the tools that they need to engage in this conversation, to answer the pushback that they’re going to get, to understand where folks are going to be uncomfortable, and try to figure out ways in which you can craft something that for your communities and in your particular political environment will be workable and move forward. I’ve started to believe that at least personally, having data is really, really critical to being able to identify and demonstrate this issue.

Folks have said, “Well, how do you get the agency to understand?” I would say, “Go for a walk, go out and walk around communities and understand what you’re actually regulating.” That’s one piece. But beyond that, I think having data available, having mapping in some case might be really useful as a first step to be able to demonstrate to folks that there actually is a problem. And then you have the tools available through these other approaches to begin to really address that.

Hannah Perls:

The Tishman Center just released a new dashboard that has a map where you can actually scroll through all the different state laws, rules, and then the bills that are moving. So we’ll make sure to link to that dashboard as well because it’s a really fantastic and easy to use resource. But Charles, I want you to have the last word.

Charles Lee:

I just wanted to build off of what Sean said. It is really important to be in touch with communities around an issue like this. I mean, I found that the interest in this issue, as communities become more aware and more developed in terms of their thinking about how to address these environmental justice and environmental injustice concerns, that cumulative impacts is really rising to the fore. And so it’s important to keep in touch with that. In that context, Sean said it, you can say it in another way. Communities have to be in the lead of the conversation and that we have to really tailor what we do based upon what they think are important, what their aspirations are, and how they want to see these types of issues become addressed.

In that context, we’re seeing this is no longer an area where there’s just a lot of activities. We’re beginning to see scholarship begin to emerge. There’s enough practice now to say that we can begin to understand the contours of what the solutions may look like. And so examples of that are you mentioned the New School’s Tishman Center, has developed a database that catalogs all the new policy on the state level and is a database that’s being added to on a daily basis. So that’s a great resource. Professor Paul Mohai, Megan Cunningham, who was a former deputy commissioner for the Chicago Department of Public Health, and I are co-editing a special issue of the Environmental Justice Journal on cumulative impacts and government decision-making.

That is going to be published in December, and it has 17 articles in it. So we could see that there’s a wide amount of, not just interest, but emerging scholarship and of course yesterday’s release of the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine report on the state of the science and future of cumulative impact assessment.

Hannah Perls:

There’s a lot of resources, a lot of homework for folks. But I think, Sean, just to bring back that community of practice idea, and I think Charles, to your point about the emerging scholarship, it’s not just that people are publishing these things in a bubble. There is a real collaborative community of folks who want to get this right. And so I’m just very grateful to you both for including me in that community, frankly. But I think also just for being willing to have this conversation and share this work, and hopefully this can be a resource for folks as well. So most importantly, thank you for all your work, but also thank you for being on CleanLaw today.

Charles Lee:

Thank you.

Sean Moriarty:

Thank you, Hannah. And thank you to all the folks at DEP who helped me get to this position where I get to have these really fun conversations with folks like you.

The grid upgrades would ease the flow of electricity in Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma, and West Virginia. The project, which will address lines owned by American Electric Power (AEP), won’t add any new routes, but it will help existing ones carry more power.

AEP is one of the largest utilities and transmission line owners in the U.S., with operations spanning 11 states. The 5,000 miles that will be upgraded represent around 13% of the company’s total network.

The loan guarantee was initiated under the Biden administration just days before President Trump was inaugurated. Previously, the Trump administration has cited approvals occurring between Election Day and Inauguration Day as justification for canceling projects.

It’s unclear what distinguished this grid modernization project from others that the Trump administration is considering canceling or in the process of canceling.

In Minnesota, the Department of Energy is moving to cancel a $467 million grant that would have helped unlock 28 gigawatts of new generating capacity, most of which would have been solar and wind. Another in Oregon would have issued $250 million in grants to connect half a dozen renewable projects.

But the largest transmission project the Trump administration wants to axe is a $630 million grant to modernize California’s grid. In many ways, it’s similar to the AEP project, looking to wring more out of the existing grid to ease congestion. As planned, the California project would test advanced conductors and dynamic line rating devices, both of which would allow old rights-of-way to carry more electricity. That’s frequently a cheaper option than building new power lines.

The AEP project will also rewire the lines with new conductors. The loan guarantee will allow the utility giant to secure a lower interest rate, saving the company at least $275 million, which it says will benefit its customers.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright said that the loan will “ensure lower electricity costs across the Midwestern region of the United States.” Already, the states included in the project have among the lowest electricity rates in the nation.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/critical-infrastructure.jpg?resize=1200,675",N,,2025-10-17 18:02:42.727815

Qatar, the EU’s third-largest LNG supplier behind the US and Russia, has warned it will stop sending LNG to the bloc should sustainability-focused regulations take effect as adopted.
Patrick Pouyanne, CEO of longtime QatarEnergy partner TotalEnergies, told the forum that he had spoken to European Commission Director-General for Energy Ditte Juul Jorgensen about CSDDD and the EU's pending methane regulations.","The flow of US LNG to European markets could be upended unless the EU quickly throttles back its new methane limits and corporate reporting regulations, top industry executives warned this week.

The bloc’s Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD) and related methane standard approved in May 2024 are “the worst, most irresponsible piece of legislation I've ever seen passed anywhere in the world,” Exxon Mobil CEO Darren Woods told delegates at the Energy Intelligence Forum 2025 in London.

The methane regulation extends to all producers, exporters and importers wanting to sell gas into the region, with importers required starting this year to report annual methane emissions data — including from countries and companies exporting to the EU.

Starting in 2030, EU gas importers must demonstrate that volumes entering the bloc comply with a yet-to-be-determined methane intensity limit, with hefty fines expected for noncompliance.

Similarly, financial penalties are expected to be issued for noncompliance with the CSDDD, which sets out sustainability reporting rules covering companies operating in the EU or doing business within it.

The EU is under intense pressure to scrap or drastically modify the regulations, which take effect Jan. 1, 2026, if it hopes to continue importing LNG from the US, which industry executives say can’t possibly comply with the stringent requirements.

The US is the largest exporter of LNG to Europe, shipping an average of about 160,000 tons per day so far this year. The US has accounted for 56% of the bloc’s LNG imports so far in 2025.

The EU is currently working on amending the CSDDD through the commission’s Omnibus Simplification Package, with Brussels having already announced that it is aiming to postpone the entry of CSDDD until 2028.

‘Sell Them Less’

Woods said Exxon is “supportive” of the human rights element of CSDDD but slammed the decarbonization element, as it requires plans that are “consistent with the objectives of the Paris accord, which today are unachievable with the existing set of technologies.”

The CEO also raised concerns with CSDDD’s requirement to reduce the emissions of its global customers, suggesting that the only way Exxon could do that would be to “sell them less.”

“And it requires us to do that, not only in Europe, but everywhere we operate around the world. … That, from my standpoint, is untenable,” Woods said.

Woods stressed that the industry is working to reduce pollutants on its own and isn’t opposed to reasonable government oversight. “Regulations that are overly prescriptive or unrealistic or that, frankly, aren't practical and can't be implemented in the short term — I think those are areas that the industry pushes back against,” he said.

‘I Appreciate the Intent’

Woodside CEO Meg O’Neill told the forum that she has no objection to the EU’s intent on being a “global leader in tackling climate change” and agreed that tackling methane emissions is “good business.”

“Why would you let a molecule that can be constructively used be emitted?” said O’Neill, whose Australian-based company owns the Louisiana LNG export project under construction on the US Gulf Coast.

However, O’Neill said the EU had “fallen short in a couple of areas,” including the complex approach it has taken with its energy policy and the proposal to impose financial penalties on companies failing to adhere to the methane regulation.

O’Neill said the legislation stands to inflate already expensive energy prices in Europe and that European industry “is going to be destroyed.”

""I appreciate the intent, but I'd encourage the European lawmakers to be thinking about unintended consequences because this would have, I think, disastrous ramifications across the continent,” O’Neill concluded.

‘Completely Uncompetitive’

ConocoPhillips CEO Ryan Lance echoed the sentiments of Woods and O’Neill, warning that US LNG producers will increasingly turn to Asia if these provisions remain in effect as adopted.

“[CSDDD] is going to make Europe completely uncompetitive. … We'll bypass Europe and go to Asia and to other parts of the world. It's that significant,” Lance told forum delegates.

But Lance said he is hopeful that “sanity” will prevail in the CSDDD conversation and that people will “move in a more constructive path.”

The Qatari Factor

The US isn’t the only major LNG supplier threatening to turn away from Europe. Qatar, the EU’s third-largest LNG supplier behind the US and Russia, has warned it will stop sending LNG to the bloc should sustainability-focused regulations take effect as adopted.

Qatari Energy Minister and QatarEnergy CEO Saad al-Kaabi has vehemently objected to the CSDDD if it faces financial risks for noncompliance. ""Put simply, if further changes are not made to CSDDD, the State of Qatar and QatarEnergy will have no choice but to seriously consider alternative markets outside of the EU for our LNG and other products, which offer a more stable and welcoming business environment,"" al-Kaabi wrote in a letter to the EU in May.

QatarEnergy owns 70% of the $10 billion Golden Pass LNG export terminal, with Exxon owning the remaining 30%. The companies expect the 18.1 million ton per year (2.5 billion cubic feet per day) Texas facility to begin operating by year’s end, with most offtake currently targeting Europe.

Patrick Pouyanne, CEO of longtime QatarEnergy partner TotalEnergies, told the forum that he had spoken to European Commission Director-General for Energy Ditte Juul Jorgensen about CSDDD and the EU's pending methane regulations.

“I told her, look, you need to make pragmatic things,” Pouyanne said, highlighting the complexity of measuring methane emissions in the US, where gas for LNG plants is generally sourced from the grid — meaning it is hard to pinpoint its origin.

Last month, Jorgensen said she was confident the commission can and will ""implement the methane regulation in a way that doesn't constitute an irritant in any way.”",https://energyintel.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/71ff191/2147483647/strip/true/crop/750x394+0+53/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fenergy-intelligence-brightspot.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com%2F4f%2Fd9%2F99fa1f0d404ca4635b7a687a0613%2Fss-2259427737-regulation.jpg,N,,2025-10-17 23:06:53.552429

In letters to Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, Merkley and Pingree criticized the agency heads for continuing to put public health and public lands at risk while failing to fulfill the mission of the agencies. As senior members of the Senate and House Appropriations Committees, the leaders are carrying out critical Congressional oversight.

“The Agency’s ongoing failure to provide complete information and to work transparently with Congress is unacceptable. As a reminder any reorganization, reprogramming, or funding change is subject to the jurisdiction of the Appropriations Committee,” write Merkley and Pingree, respectively Ranking Members of the Senate and house Interior-Environment Appropriations Subcommittees.

“Decades of institutional knowledge and scientific expertise have been lost and are in further danger of being eroded. Losing staff with specialized training in toxicology, water quality science, and cumulative impact assessment is not efficient and does not achieve mission-critical goals like protecting Americans from environmental hazards, regardless of administration. These are not abstract bureaucratic concerns; these are matters of quality of life, cost of living, and public health,” the Ranking Members told EPA Administrator Zeldin.

In a second letter to Interior Secretary Burgum, Merkley and Pingree press the Secretary to respond ahead of reported RIFs coming as early as next week. Merkley and Pingree pointedly criticize the agency’s attempts to reorganize several offices without providing responses to questions from the subcommittees and its delay in scheduling briefings as required.

“Mr. Secretary, every dollar of funding, every reorganization, every reprogramming, and every funding change or transfer is the direct jurisdiction of Congress and specifically our Committees. The Committees did not receive any notifications, materials, briefings, or other information about this major change – or any of the previous major personnel changes – in order to evaluate it,” write Merkley and Pingree to Interior Secretary Burgum. “There is simply zero justification for the drastic staffing cuts that have already been implemented, let alone another RIF.”

“A staffing loss of this level would cripple our ability to appropriately manage public lands on behalf of the American people, meet tribal treaty and trust responsibilities, and respond to growing threats of wildfire across the landscape and in our communities,” Merkley and Pingree add. “Decades of institutional knowledge were destroyed in a matter of months and are in further danger of being eroded. Losing staff with expertise and experience is not efficient and does not achieve mission critical goals.”

Interior Appropriations Subcommittee Ranking Members Merkley and Pingree cite the critical function of the Interior workforce, many in public-facing roles such as park rangers, refuge staff, and recreation specialists on public lands that span 500 million acres in all 50 states and U.S. territories. Additionally, RIFs would delay Tribes from getting their funding from self-governance contracts.

Credits and Emissions

The electric vehicle tax credit, previously offering up to $4,000 for used vehicles and $7,500 for new ones, ended on September 30. Meanwhile, the EPA plans to ease auto tailpipe emissions standards, aligning with President Donald Trump’s effort to reverse policies that encourage the transition to electric.

By successfully mass-producing solid-state batteries, Toyota could effectively ""leapfrog"" the current generation of EV technology.
It would shift the competitive benchmark from battery cost—where China excels—to technological superiority in performance, safety, and convenience.
Wrapping Up Toyota's pivot to mass-producing solid-state batteries is the culmination of its long and deliberate EV strategy.
Born from a deep-seated caution about the limitations of current battery technology, this move is a bold attempt to redefine the electric vehicle landscape.","For years, Toyota, the titan of the automotive world, has been viewed as a reluctant participant in the all-electric vehicle revolution. While competitors raced to launch new battery electric vehicles (BEVs), the Japanese giant seemed to be dragging its feet, earning criticism from environmental groups and EV enthusiasts alike. But a recent announcement signals a potential paradigm shift in its strategy, a high-stakes bet that could either redefine the market or cement its status as a laggard. In early October, Toyota announced a joint venture with Sumitomo Metal Mining to mass-produce cathode materials for solid-state batteries, with plans to launch cars featuring this breakthrough technology by 2027 or 2028. This isn't just an incremental update; it's a potential game-changer. Solid-state batteries promise to be a holy grail for EVs, replacing the flammable liquid electrolyte in current lithium-ion batteries with a solid material, offering higher energy density for longer range, significantly faster charging times, and enhanced safety.

Toyota's Calculated Hesitation

To understand the gravity of this move, one must first understand Toyota's long-standing skepticism towards a BEV-only future. The company that pioneered hybridization with the Prius has consistently advocated for a ""multi-pathway approach"" to decarbonization. For years, Toyota executives argued that a premature rush to all-electric vehicles was misguided. They pointed to several valid concerns: the high cost and environmental impact of battery production, the strain on global mineral supply chains, the lack of robust charging infrastructure in many parts of the world, and the fact that hybrids still offered a more immediate and accessible way for the masses to reduce emissions.

Instead of going all-in on BEVs, Toyota diversified its bets, continuing to refine its world-leading hybrid systems, developing plug-in hybrids (PHEVs), and investing heavily in hydrogen fuel cell technology, as seen with its Mirai sedan. This cautious strategy was often interpreted as stubbornness or a failure to innovate. In reality, it was a pragmatic, if conservative, calculation. Toyota was unwilling to commit its vast manufacturing empire to a technology it viewed as immature and fraught with logistical hurdles. They were waiting for a breakthrough that aligned with their core principles of reliability and mass-market viability. Solid-state batteries appear to be the breakthrough they were waiting for.

A Silver Bullet Against China's Dominance?

Toyota's timing is critical. While it has been cautious, Chinese automakers, led by giants like BYD, have stormed the global EV market. China now dominates the EV space, not just in sales but in the most critical component: the battery supply chain. Chinese companies control a huge portion of the mining and refining of essential minerals and are leaders in producing cost-effective and increasingly popular LFP (lithium iron phosphate) batteries. For Western and Japanese automakers, competing with China on the current lithium-ion playing field is a daunting uphill battle.

This is where Toyota’s solid-state strategy could be a stroke of genius. Instead of trying to catch up in a race they are already losing, they are attempting to change the race entirely. By successfully mass-producing solid-state batteries, Toyota could effectively ""leapfrog"" the current generation of EV technology. A Toyota EV in 2028 with a 600-plus-mile range that can recharge in minutes would represent a monumental advantage over any vehicle on the market today. It would shift the competitive benchmark from battery cost—where China excels—to technological superiority in performance, safety, and convenience. This move is a direct challenge not to match China’s current strengths, but to render them obsolete with a next-generation standard.

Is It Too Little, Too Late?

The multi-billion-dollar question is whether Toyota can pull it off in time. A 2027-2028 launch window feels both tantalizingly close and perilously far away. By then, competitors will have nearly a decade of experience in building and marketing EVs. They will have refined their software, built out their charging networks, and secured their own supply chains for current-generation batteries. Furthermore, lithium-ion technology is not standing still. Advances in battery chemistry and cell design are continuously improving energy density and charging speeds, potentially narrowing the performance gap that solid-state batteries promise to create.

Toyota is in a high-stakes race not just against other legacy automakers like VW and Honda, who also have solid-state ambitions, but against the relentless pace of incremental innovation. If production delays push the launch to 2030 or beyond, or if the cost of the technology remains too high for the mainstream market, Toyota's gamble could backfire spectacularly. In that scenario, they would have squandered precious years while their rivals solidified their positions in the defining automotive transition of our time. The company is betting the house that its technological leap will be significant enough to erase its late start.

Wrapping Up

Toyota's pivot to mass-producing solid-state batteries is the culmination of its long and deliberate EV strategy. Born from a deep-seated caution about the limitations of current battery technology, this move is a bold attempt to redefine the electric vehicle landscape. It serves as a direct counter-offensive to the market dominance established by Chinese manufacturers, aiming to shift the battleground from cost to next-generation performance. Whether this proves to be a visionary masterstroke or a desperate, delayed entry will depend entirely on execution. If Toyota can deliver a reliable, affordable solid-state EV by 2028, it will not only have caught up but will have positioned itself to lead the next phase of the electric era.

Summary: Toyota's plan to mass-produce solid-state batteries by 2028 is a high-stakes gamble to leapfrog current EV technology and challenge China's market dominance, but its success hinges on delivering the breakthrough on time and at a competitive cost.

Energy is not only a national security concern given the leverage it gives Beijing and Moscow, but it is also a massive business opportunity that touches all sectors of the economy, including critical minerals. Despite China and Russia’s advantage, the United States has an opportunity to reestablish itself as a serious competitor by focusing on the development of micro and small modular reactors (SMRs) and also working to coordinate better financing and private engagement to export this technology to its African partners.

600 million Africans lack access to electricity, which is nearly 40 percent of the continent. This shortage not only impacts health, with biomass pollution killing millions of African children every year and the lack of electricity limiting health services, but it also restricts economic development. Mines, data centers, and other economic projects driving economic growth on the continent are energy-intensive. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) estimates that economic growth in Africa will lead to electricity demand growing by 40 percent by 2030 and almost seven times its current level by 2050.

African countries are increasingly turning to nuclear energy, with half of the 30 IAEA “newcomer countries” located in Africa. Renewables, such as solar and wind, will surely feature in Africa’s future energy mix. However, larger energy base loads and more stable and economically efficient energy sources are needed to support the digitization, industrialization, and urbanization underpinning Africa’s economic growth.

While the will for nuclear energy clearly exists, African countries face various challenges in developing nuclear energy sources. First, large-scale powerplants cost billions, mostly in upfront investments, which many governments cannot afford. Additionally, many countries lack the expertise to support the engineering, operational, and regulatory functions involved with nuclear energy. Lastly, nuclear energy requires extensive infrastructure—both “hard” infrastructure to support nuclear facilities and an expanded electric grid, as well as “soft” infrastructure, consisting of the necessary regulatory and institutional frameworks.

Russia has positioned itself as a global leader in the nuclear energy market, including in Africa. The Kremlin is an attractive partner thanks to its comprehensive aid package, which includes generous financing options, educational training, and infrastructure support, all easily accessible through the state-owned energy company Rosatom.21 African countries have signed nuclear cooperation agreements with Russia in the last decade, including at least eight proposed or in progress large-scale nuclear power plants. The Kremlin is also pursuing uranium mining deals in Africa to increase its grip on the nuclear energy market, with the continent holding 20 percent of global uranium reserves.

China is increasingly exporting its expertise. Beijing has rapidly expanded state-backed “nuclear” or “green” Belt and Road initiatives abroad, including in Africa, despite not offering any public nuclear energy financing in Africa from 2012 to 2021. Of the six African countries that have reached at least phase two of the IAEA nuclear development milestones, China has deals with four—Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, and South Africa.In 2024, China held its first China-Africa Forum on the Peaceful Use of Nuclear Technology in Ethiopia and it would hold future fora as part of its 2025-2027 Beijing Action Plan.

Chinese and Russian dominance in the nuclear sector will translate to long-term partnerships and leverage. Beijing and Moscow are securing decades of influence due to the long timelines and wide-ranging scope of nuclear energy projects. Energy also equates to leverage. African countries relying on Chinese- or Russian-backed energy projects or fuel may feel compelled—or be coerced—to align with China and Russia on sensitive topics to protect their economies and overall national security. Moscow has weaponized energy reliance against the West since it invaded Ukraine.

The United States is also missing out on substantial business opportunities by failing to prioritize the energy sector. Africa’s energy sector is one of the fastest-growing sectors on the continent. US companies were involved in over $25 billion worth of deals and had another $20 billion in upcoming projects at the beginning of 2025.

Critical mineral supply chains are also intertwined with energy infrastructure. US energy investments can help establish the energy infrastructure needed to support mineral production and entice greater mine development, securing US mineral access in the process.

The advent of micro and small modular reactors presents an opportunity for the United States to get back into the game. SMRs are better suited for many African countries due to their cheaper up-front cost and better compatibility with smaller energy grids. Their modularity also makes them more resilient to supply chain disruptions and better able to be safely deployed in a wider array of locations, such as rural areas and energy-intensive economic sites.

Fortunately for the United States, SMRs are better suited to American strengths than larger power plants. SMRs are much more compatible with private investment and innovation due to their lower cost, modularity, and potential for mass production. Large-scale power plants, on the other hand, suit China’s and Russia’s state-owned nuclear energy enterprises and the vast sums of public funding they bring to bear.

The United States already has many of the resources it needs to ride the wave of the SMR revolution. The United States has invested billions into developing SMRs over the last decade, and the Trump administration re-approved $900 million in funding to support the domestic SMR development as part of President Trump’s initiative to “unleash” American energy and quadruple nuclear energy production.

The Trump administration has also supported efforts to export this technology through continued support for the FIRST program, a government initiative to leverage public-private partnerships to support partner countries with training and capacity building, regulatory support, and procurement for SMRs. FIRST supports American companies and have already helped the United States secure deals to develop SMR technology in Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, and Rwanda.

Still, the United States will be in fierce competition with China and Russia. Russia has deployed its first floating SMR domestically and is negotiating deals to export the technology to coastal African countries. China and Russia have both developed their first land-based SMRs and signed deals with South Africa and Zimbabwe, respectively, to eventually export SMR technology.

Given this position, the United States must focus on scaling up its efforts. Financing will remain a key issue, and joint funding arrangements—both for Western developers and African buyers—should be a focal point. The United States should work with its allies to help co-develop and co-finance SMR exports to Africa. Such partners include Argentina, Canada, Japan, and South Korea, all of which are FIRST contributing members with already-existing projects in Africa.

The United States’ engagement with Africa’s regional economic and power blocs will be critical. Africa has eight regional economic blocs and five regional power pools, which support cross-border electricity trading. Engaging these blocs will generate joint funding for multi-country projects. For SMRs, this could take the form bulk orders, which would make SMR exports more financially viable for private companies. Regional energy investments will also support other regional infrastructure, trade, and investment opportunities, including in the critical mineral sector.

Another financing option, public-private partnerships, are becoming increasingly viable. Development finance institutions such as the World Bank and European Bank for Reconstruction and Development have become more willing to fund nuclear energy projects in recent years. This shift will hopefully be mirrored by African and other international funding institutions that have avoided nuclear energy funding.

To support these various initiatives, the United States and its African partners should make better use of comprehensive tools already at their disposal—the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) and Power Africa. For African countries, AfCTFA will help mobilize capital to invest in regional public-private partnerships and make it easier for countries to export surplus energy, both of which encourage the scaling of energy projects. AfCTFA will also enable African countries, especially those in the FIRST program, to become leading partners with the United States in further spreading nuclear technology and expertise on the continent without trade restrictions. For US companies, AfCFTA has the potential to create a more unified market and regulatory system across national borders, further enabling bulk orders and making it easier to work with multiple countries.

The Trump administration should restore funding to Power Africa, a program clearly aligned with the President’s energy initiatives that was, unfortunately, collateral damage during the 2025 DOGE cuts. The program had incentivized more than $80 billion in commitments from other private and public funding streams since 2013, resulting in an added 14.3 gigawatts of electricity and a more than tenfold return on its funding. Renewing Power Africa would secure more joint funding, public-private partnerships, and support other de-risking tools­—such as loans and loan guarantees—to drive US investment.

African countries have identified nuclear energy as a promising energy source, and the United States should listen to its African partners. African countries do not want to be beholden to Beijing or Moscow, but Washington must offer competitive alternatives. The United States is well-positioned to do so with the advent of SMRs, but it must make better use of its tools to scale its current efforts.

Amazon’s Lee County, FL robotics fulfillment center marks a major win for Florida’s logistics economy — 650,000 sq ft, AI automation, 1,000 new jobs, and transformative regional impacts.

In January 2025, Amazon confirmed plans to construct a 650,000-square-foot robotics fulfillment center on a 143-acre parcel in Lee County, Florida, just east of Fort Myers.

The investment — valued at roughly $300 million — represents one of Florida’s largest logistics projects of the year and underscores Amazon’s nationwide shift toward AI-driven automation and next-generation supply-chain infrastructure.

The project is expected to generate 1,000 direct jobs and hundreds of indirect positions across construction, transportation, and support services. It’s also a major victory for the Lee County Economic Development Office, the Southwest Florida Economic Development Alliance, and state partners who collaborated to secure the deal.

1. Project Overview

The facility will serve as both a logistics hub and a testing ground for Amazon’s new generation of AI-enabled sorting and packing robots. It will also incorporate solar rooftops, on-site EV charging, and a zero-waste design intended to advance Amazon’s 2040 net-zero carbon target.

2. Why Lee County Won the Deal

Strategic Geography

Southwest Florida offers direct access to I-75, Florida Gulf Coast University, and a rapidly expanding population corridor connecting Naples, Fort Myers, and Sarasota. For Amazon, this corridor shortens delivery times into both Gulf Coast metros and Central Florida distribution arteries.

Workforce & Training Infrastructure

Lee County’s workforce ecosystem, coordinated by CareerSource Southwest Florida and Florida SouthWestern State College, provides logistics and mechatronics programs tailored to automation roles. The region’s labor shed reaches into Collier, Charlotte, and Hendry Counties, ensuring a sustainable pipeline for both technicians and operations specialists.

Real Estate Readiness

The 143-acre parcel—formerly zoned for light industrial use—was already equipped with key utilities, making it a “speed-to-market” location. The county’s streamlined Development Review Committee (DRC) process trimmed permitting cycles by roughly 35%.

Power & Infrastructure Reliability

Florida Power & Light (FPL) committed to upgrade substation capacity and extend dual-feed reliability for Amazon’s automation demands. Given that power availability has emerged as the number-one site-selection filter (per SEDC 2025 survey), this assurance sealed the location advantage.

3. Regional Economic Impact

A 2025 analysis by Florida Commerce projects:

$1.2 billion in total economic output over 10 years (direct + indirect + induced)

$56 million in new annual wages across logistics, construction, and services

$15.8 million in annual state and local tax revenue once operational

According to Holly Smith, Lee County Commission Chair:

“This investment positions Southwest Florida as a logistics innovation hub. We’ve diversified beyond tourism and construction into advanced, resilient industry.”

Local officials also note collateral benefits: increased demand for warehouse space, trucking, EV charging infrastructure, and smart-grid projects.

4. Florida’s Logistics Renaissance

Amazon’s announcement is part of a broader Florida logistics expansion wave that includes:

Wal-Mart’s new e-commerce DC in Cocoa (Brevard County)

Publix cold-chain expansion in Lakeland

PortMiami and PortTampa Bay dredging and automation projects

Space Florida’s freight-aerospace synergy initiatives

Together, these signal a state-wide repositioning toward automated logistics, AI integration, and energy-efficient operations.

According to FloridaCommerce’s 2025 report, logistics now accounts for 1 in 8 Florida jobs and contributes $56 billion annually to state GDP.

5. Inside Amazon’s Robotics Strategy

The Path to Full Automation

Amazon’s fulfillment network has evolved through five generations of robotics integration:

Kiva-based mobility (2012–2016)

Automated storage & retrieval (2017–2019)

Vision AI for sortation (2020–2022)

Autonomous mobile robots (Proteus, Sequoia)

Hybrid human-machine collaborative workflows (2024 onward)

The Lee County facility will operate on Generation 5 — where machine learning orchestrates robot fleets and human workers supervise “exceptions.”

Sustainability Edge

Amazon plans to install a 7-MW rooftop solar array, deploy 100 % EV yard tractors, and recycle 98 % of construction waste. The company also signed an MOU with FPL SolarTogether to offset grid emissions through renewable credits.

Research Collaboration

The company is partnering with Florida Gulf Coast University’s Innovation Hub to develop talent pipelines in robotics, automation software, and AI logistics analytics — a first for Southwest Florida.

6. Incentives & Public Support

Although Amazon typically relies on limited incentives, local sources confirm a package that includes:

Qualified Target Industry (QTI) tax refunds of up to $2 million (performance-based)

Infrastructure assistance under Florida’s Job Growth Grant Fund (~$4 million for road and utility upgrades)

Local property tax abatement phased over 10 years

Training reimbursements via CareerSource Florida

Economic Development Director John Talmage summarized:

“We structured a package focused on workforce and infrastructure — not giveaways. Amazon’s long-term commitment and the talent ladder we’ll build are the real wins.”

10. Key Takeaways

Strategic Location: Lee County’s logistics corridor and readiness gave Amazon a “plug-and-play” advantage.

Automation Economy: AI and robotics integration define the next decade of distribution.

Workforce First: Strong talent pipeline was essential — not just land cost.

Energy Reliability: Power capacity is the new currency of site selection.

Community Synergy: Early collaboration between EDOs, utilities, and educators proved decisive.

Combined, they will add more than 10 Bcf/d of new capacity.

Plaquemines LNG and Corpus Christi Stage 3 began shipping cargoes earlier in 2025 but have not yet reached commercial operations. Pipeline infrastructure remains a key constraint, as new projects are needed to deliver gas from producing basins to coastal terminals.

Canada and Mexico Add West Coast and Floating Capacity

In Canada, LNG Canada shipped its first cargo in mid-2025, marking a milestone for the nation’s first LNG export facility. The project’s two trains will produce up to 1.84 Bcf/d, with a second phase planned to double capacity after 2029. Additional projects under construction include Woodfibre LNG (0.3 Bcf/d) and Cedar LNG (0.4 Bcf/d), both sourcing feedgas from the Montney Formation.

Mexico is also entering the LNG export market, with Fast LNG Altamira and Energía Costa Azul adding a combined 0.6 Bcf/d of capacity. Both facilities will export U.S.-sourced natural gas, marking a growing cross-border integration between the U.S. and Mexican midstream sectors.",https://pgjonline.com/media/7407/nemec_energia-costa-azul-lng_2.jpg?v=1dc1b24da323b90,N,,2025-10-17 17:08:46.664517

CHICAGO (October 17, 2025) – This week, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) began removing hazardous waste from the former Glycerin Traders facility at 3522 South State Route 104 in La Porte, Indiana. EPA estimates the work to remove hazardous waste will be completed this fall, weather dependent.

More than 700 containers of liquid waste are stored at the property, the contents of which are unknown. Labels on some containers indicated the potential presence of hydrochloric acid, organic peroxides, and potassium nitrate. Containers of acids, oxidizers, and flammable oxidizers were observed on pallets. Many containers of hazardous chemicals are in poor condition, open, corroded, or bulging. The improper storage of the chemicals could result in a release of hazardous substances into the environment or a fire, leading to EPA’s swift action to remove the immediate threat to public health and the environment.

EPA will identify the waste, and consolidate, package and remove any hazardous substances off-site for proper and safe disposal. Air monitoring will be conducted during the cleanup to ensure cleanup activities on-site do not impact air quality off-site. Nearby residents may notice increased vehicle activity in the area and workers in personal protective equipment.

Background:

Glycerin Traders operated as a waste-materials refining and processing facility between 2010 and 2024. The facility historically received waste oils, acids, flammables, solvents, and unknown materials to be processed into usable products. Indiana Department of Emergency Management (IDEM) found Glycerin Traders in violation of numerous Resource Conservation and Recovery Act waste management practices. IDEM requested EPA assistance to assess whether the site met the criteria for a time-critical removal action from the agency in April 2025.

More information about the response is available at the Glycerin Traders removal website.

Electric utilities that receive loans through the program must provide assurances to the government that financial benefits from the financing will be passed on to customers, the Energy Department said.
Wright, in a conference call with reporters, distinguished the AEP loan guarantee from a $4.9 billion federal loan guarantee the department cancelled in July.
The loan guarantee to AEP was among those conditionally approved under Biden, a fact Wright acknowledged to reporters.","WASHINGTON (AP) — The Department of Energy said Thursday it has finalized a $1.6 billion loan guarantee to a subsidiary of one of the nation’s largest power companies to upgrade nearly 5,000 miles of transmission lines across five states, mostly in the Midwest, for largely fossil fuel-run energy.

AEP Transmission will upgrade power lines in Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma and West Virginia to enhance enhance grid reliability and capacity, the Energy Department said. The project, first offered under the Biden administration, is meant to help meet surging electricity demand from data centers and artificial intelligence.

Ohio-based American Electric Power, which owns AEP Transmission, is one of the nation’s largest utilities, serving 5.6 million customers in 11 states. It primarily produces electricity from coal, natural gas and nuclear power, along with renewable resources such as wind and hydroelectric power.

Thursday’s announcement deepens the Trump administration’s commitment to traditional, polluting energy sources even as it works to discourage the U.S. from clean energy use.

Earlier this month, the administration cancelled $7.6 billion in grants that supported hundreds of clean energy projects in 16 states, all of which voted for Democrat Kamala Harris in last year’s presidential election. A total of 223 projects were terminated after a review determined they did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs or were not economically viable, the Energy Department said.

The cancellations include up to $1.2 billion for California’s hydrogen hub aimed at developing clean-burning hydrogen fuels to power ships and heavy-duty trucks. A hydrogen project costing up to $1 billion in the Pacific Northwest also was cancelled.

The loan guarantee finalized Thursday is the first offered by the Trump administration under the recently renamed Energy Dominance Financing program created by the massive tax-and-spending law approved this summer by congressional Republicans and signed by President Donald Trump. Electric utilities that receive loans through the program must provide assurances to the government that financial benefits from the financing will be passed on to customers, the Energy Department said.

The project and others being considered will help ensure that Americans “will have access to affordable, reliable and secure energy for decades to come,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a statement.

“The president has been clear: America must reverse course from the energy subtraction agenda of past administrations and strengthen our electrical grid,” Wright said, adding that modernizing the grid and expanding transmission capacity “will help position the United States to win the AI race and grow our manufacturing base.”

The upgrades supported by the federal financing will replace existing transmission lines in existing rights-of-way with new lines capable of carrying more energy, the power company said.

More than 2,000 miles of transmission lines in Ohio serving 1.5 million people will be replaced, along with more than 1,400 miles in Indiana and Michigan serving 600,000 customers, the company said. An additional 1,400 miles in Oklahoma, serving about 1.2 million people and 26 miles in West Virginia, serving 460,000 people, will be replaced.

The projects will create about 1,100 construction jobs, the company said.

The loan guarantee will save customers money and improve reliability while supporting economic growth in the five states, said Bill Fehrman, AEP’s chairman, president and chief executive officer. “The funds we will save through this program enable us to make additional investments to enhance service for our customers,” he added.

Wright, in a conference call with reporters, distinguished the AEP loan guarantee from a $4.9 billion federal loan guarantee the department cancelled in July. That money would have boosted the planned Grain Belt Express, a new high-voltage transmission line set to deliver solar and wind-generated electricity from the Midwest to eastern states.

The Energy Department said at the time it was “not critical for the federal government to have a role” in the first phase of the $11 billion project planned by Chicago-based Invenergy. The department also questioned whether the project could meet strict financial conditions required, a claim Wright repeated Thursday.

“Ultimately that is a commercial enterprise that needs private developers,” Wright said. The company has indicated the Grain Belt project will go forward.

Trump and Wright have repeatedly derided wind and solar energy as unreliable and opposed efforts to combat climate change by moving away from fossil fuels. Wright said the Grain Belt Express loan was among billions of dollars worth of commitments “rushed out the door” in the waning days of former President Joe Biden’s administration.

The loan guarantee to AEP was among those conditionally approved under Biden, a fact Wright acknowledged to reporters.

“Not all of the (Biden-era) projects were nonsense,” he said, adding that he was “happy to move forward” with the transmission upgrade.",https://www.louisianafirstnews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/80/2025/10/68f1596ae6a417.68033726.jpeg?w=1280,N,,2025-10-17 16:02:46.368245

Sacramento (USA) - Demand for zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs) in California is soaring, despite efforts by the Trump administration to hinder the Golden State’s pursuit of a 100% clean energy future. In the third quarter of 2025, 29.1% of all new car purchases were ZEVs - a new record.

As California Governor Gavin Newsom announced, Californians bought 124,755 zero-emission vehicles between July and September. Despite numerous setbacks caused by the Trump administration, California is making its direction clear: electric vehicles are the future.

Record EV Sales in California

“This is unprecedented - we’re nearing a third of all new vehicles sold in the fourth largest economy on the planet being clean cars,” said Governor Gavin Newsom. “ We’re setting new records because this state believes in innovation, not isolation. While Trump sells out American innovation to China, California will keep charging ahead on our path to a future of cleaner air.”

Nancy Skinner, Commissioner of the California Energy Commission (CEC), added: “This is a defining moment for California’s ZEV progress and sends a clear message to Washington: ZEVs are here to stay.” She emphasized that the work and investments of the CEC and its partners in expanding the state’s charging network have paid off, with almost every Californian now living within 10 minutes of a fast-charging station.

Skinner’s message is clear: “Now, new EV owners can enjoy a great driving experience bidding goodbye to smelly gas stations, messy oil changes, and costly engine tune-ups.”

Lauren Sanchez, Chair of the California Air Resources Board, added: “ While the federal government stumbles backward with reckless rollbacks and short-sighted policies, California charges ahead lighting the path to a cleaner, more prosperous future. From pioneering clean transportation in the 1970s to becoming the world’s 4th largest economy today, we’ve proven time and again that protecting air quality and the climate isn’t just the right thing to do, it’s smart economic policy.”

Diversity and Growth in the ZEV Market - Expanding Charging Infrastructure

The zero-emission vehicle market is becoming increasingly diverse: in Q1 2025, 146 ZEV models were available, compared to 105 the year before. Of the 124,755 ZEVs purchased in Q3, 108,685 were battery electric vehicles (BEVs) - another all-time high. Compared to Q2 2025, EV sales increased by nearly 30%. Consumer confidence in both the technology and the infrastructure is visibly growing.

California is the first U.S. state to implement binding reliability and reporting standards for public charging stations, improving the performance of publicly funded fast chargers and ensuring greater transparency across the state charging network.

On October 8, 2025, the California Energy Commission (CEC) approved the construction of 64 new fast chargers along key highway corridors under the NEVI program, helping to reduce range anxiety. Grants were also approved for the repair of 30 existing and installation of 30 new fast chargers. Three additional grants totaling over $10 million will fund the construction of more than 1,000 Level 2 chargers, primarily in multi-family housing for low-income and underserved communities.

Low-income Californians are also eligible for thousands of dollars in grants and rebates when purchasing a ZEV. The state is cutting red tape and prioritizing infrastructure development in hard-to-reach regions.

One Million Charging Points - The Gold Standard for American EV Infrastructure

While state funding programs continue to boost ZEV adoption, driving electric vehicles is becoming increasingly practical in everyday life. California now has over 200,000 publicly accessible charging stations, located at supermarkets, park-and-ride facilities, gas stations, apartment complexes, workplaces, clinics, and sports venues. This is complemented by around 800,000 private home chargers, a crucial factor for widespread EV adoption.

About the California Energy Commission (CEC)

The California Energy Commission is the state’s primary energy policy and planning agency. Its seven core responsibilities include advancing energy policy, promoting energy efficiency, certifying thermal power plants, investing in energy innovation, expanding renewable energy, transforming the transportation sector, preparing for energy emergencies.

Both lawsuits filed against the agency accuse the EPA of illegally revoking money promised under the Solar for All program without congressional approval.

Solar for All was established in 2022 with the Inflation Reduction Act, which granted $7 billion in federal funding to help lower-income families access solar panels and battery storage programs. The program was expected to save participants an estimated $1,740 annually on their utility bills. After President Trump took office in January, Solar for All grants were largely frozen. In August, the EPA formally terminated Solar for All, citing President Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act. According to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, the EPA did not have the authority to administer the program or the appropriate funds to keep the program running.

The first lawsuit pushing back against the EPA’s cancellation of Solar for All came earlier this month when a group of plaintiffs comprised of solar energy companies, labor unions, and homeowners filed a lawsuit in Rhode Island accusing the EPA of ending Solar for All in violation of federal law. The plaintiffs assert the program was expected to secure 4,000 megawatts of new solar energy over five years, generate 200,000 new jobs, and would have helped save energy costs. Their complaint also accuses the Trump administration of attempting to recapture “billions of congressionally approved dollars in climate funding that was approved during the Biden administration.” The plaintiffs are seeking an injunction and for the EPA to reinstate the Solar for All program.

The latest lawsuit was filed Oct.13 by Harris County Attorney Christian Menefee. Harris County, which is comprised of Houston and the surrounding area, is contesting the cancellation of more than $400 million in solar energy grants earmarked for Texas-based organizations. Menefee’s complaint claims that the One Big Beautiful Bill Act did not give the EPA authority to cancel Solar for All grants as those funds had already been legally committed to the program. The complaint further asserts that the EPA’s cancellation of funding “jeopardizes the county’s ability to deliver critical infrastructure promised to create thousands of well-paying jobs, protect residents from extreme whether by reinforcing the county’s electrical grid, and reduce energy costs for tens of thousands of low-income households.”

The lawsuits are not the first to challenge the EPA’s termination of Biden-era climate grants. There have been numerous lawsuits filed since President Trump took office challenging the EPA’s termination of federal funding awarded through the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF), most notable, Climate United Fund v. Citibank. In April, the District Court for the District of Columbia in the Climate United Fund Matter issued a preliminary injunction that prevented the EPA from effectuating GGRF grant terminations while the litigation was pending. In September, however, an appeals court set aside the preliminary injunction in its entirety, stating that “the grantees are not likely to succeed on the merits because their claims are essentially contractional,” asserting that the claims must be brought before a special court that handles contract disputes involving the federal government. The grantees are appealing that decision and proceeding with litigation.

The Climate United Fund matter is one to watch as more entities file suit against the EPA for the termination of funds under GGRF and the Solar for All program. While that litigation is pending, however, the EPA is likely to face additional lawsuits over its funding cuts.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.16177_1251.png,N,,2025-10-17 17:08:01.448546

From the September / October 2025 Issue

Arizona has continued to advance a robust set of economic development strategies designed to attract businesses and retain jobs across diverse industries. The state emphasizes both streamlined access for entrepreneurs and substantive incentives to assist both established firms and underserved communities.

One of the state’s flagship initiatives in 2025 has been the BuildItAZ Apprenticeship Initiative, administered by the Arizona Office of Economic Opportunity. This program targets workforce shortages in critical sectors such as construction, infrastructure, and advanced manufacturing.

By offering millions in competitive grants to registered apprenticeship programs, Arizona aims to double its apprenticeship participation by 2026. In 2025, the state awarded $3 million in new grants, supporting employer partnerships, training capacity, and wrap-around services like childcare and transportation for apprentices. A third round of grants was also launched to help programs expand facilities, hire instructors, and purchase training equipment.

The state has also expanded career pathways through Talent Ready AZ, a cross-agency initiative designed to align education with industry needs in high-demand fields like clean energy, IT, aerospace, and healthcare. The ReadyTechGo program, part of this initiative, launched accelerated technical training programs at community colleges, enabling Arizona residents to earn industry credentials within weeks rather than over years.

The Arizona Office of Economic Opportunity has proposed a key initiative called the Arizona Microbusiness Loan Program. Launched in 2024 and activated in 2025, this program supports microbusinesses—those with five or fewer employees—by providing loans to up to $50,000 through community lending partners. The program reinvests repayments back into the loan pool, ensuring sustained support for small-scale entrepreneurs across rural and urban communities.

Business One Stop is an online portal revamped in early 2025 to streamline business formation and compliance. The platform enables fast, multi-agency registration and filings, aimed at reducing manual processes. In 2025 so far, it auto-approved nearly 1,500 new businesses and eliminated over 13,000 business days of bureaucratic delay.

Innovative support for underserved entrepreneurs is exemplified by Impact AZ 2025, a minority business accelerator offering training, mentorship, and supplier-diversity readiness. Launched statewide in 2025, the program connects minority-owned businesses to public and private contracting opportunities, builds business capabilities, and fosters job growth.

Arizona: Where The Future Takes Shape

Arizona continues to set the pace for economic growth, leading the nation in high-tech investment and innovation.

As home to global companies across in-demand industries, the state has earned a reputation as a premier destination for technologies shaping the future.

In the fiscal year that ended on June 30, 2025, the Arizona Commerce Authority (ACA) and local economic development agencies worked with companies that committed to creating 24,285 projected new Arizona jobs and investing over $31 billion in Arizona communities.

“Arizona’s economic momentum has never been stronger, fueled by strategic initiatives that are supporting high-paying job growth in communities statewide,” said Sandra Watson, President and CEO of the Arizona Commerce Authority. “With our unmatched business climate, skilled workforce, top-tier education institutions, and strong industry clusters, Arizona continues to attract global leaders across high-tech industries, further supporting our local small businesses and suppliers.”

This success is no accident. It reflects years of smart policy, forward-looking investments, and a business-friendly environment that consistently attracts top talent and industry leaders. Arizona’s innovation ecosystem, bolstered by world-class universities and a highly-skilled workforce, offers the full package for companies seeking to scale and thrive.

Today, Arizona is globally recognized for its leadership in semiconductors, aerospace and defense, biosciences, batteries, AI, and more. As the state continues to attract global leaders in high-growth industries, it’s clear Arizona is the ideal location for business success.

Reliable energy powers sustainable growth. In addition to abundant talent and a pro-business climate, Arizona offers one of the most reliable and resilient energy grids in the nation—critical for advanced and large-scale operations. With minimal weather-related disruptions, Arizona experienced only six extreme weather-related power outages from 2000 to 2023, well below the national average.

And, more than 44% of Arizona’s power generation comes from clean or renewable sources. The state is home to the second-largest nuclear power plant in the U.S., the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station, which generates more than 32 million megawatt-hours annually.

An epicenter for emerging technologies. Arizona is at the forefront of artificial intelligence (AI) and emerging technologies, with global leaders like Apple, Intel, TSMC, Avnet, Cognite, Microsoft, and more operating in the state. Innovation hubs such as Tech Parks Arizona, SkySong, Moonshot, and the Phoenix Bioscience Core are accelerating innovation growth across many sectors.

The state is also home to more than 230 AI-related startups—a number that continues to grow. In recognition of this momentum, the Arizona Commerce Authority selected 10 Software as a Service (SaaS)/AI startups as Fall 2025 Arizona Innovation Challenge awardees.

A premier event destination. Arizona will host SEMICON West, North America’s premier microelectronics exhibition and conference for the first time on October 7-9, 2025. Relocating to Phoenix for the first time after 50 years in San Francisco, the event shift showcases Arizona’s semiconductor leadership. This year’s conference is anticipated to attract more than 35,000 attendees, which would be its largest yet.

Looking ahead to 2026, Arizona will host Arizona Tech Week, the state’s first-ever decentralized tech conference from April 6-12, 2026. The first-of-its-kind conference in Arizona will emphasize the state’s prominent role in the global tech ecosystem and showcase its most compelling innovations and tech leaders.

Ford, GM, and Stellantis have banded together to ask his government to scrap Canada’s zero-emission vehicle mandate, pleading poverty and technological impossibility. Apparently, after a mere century of automotive innovation, these giants have forgotten how to build cars unless they’re permitted to keep belching emissions indefinitely. Their preferred business model involves Canada indefinitely subsidizing nostalgia, rather than seizing an obvious electric future.

Now Stellantis has announced it’s abandoning manufacturing of a major EV line in Brampton, impacting 5,000 Canadian workers.

Let’s be clear. The global automotive market is electrifying quickly, not slowly. Norway is already at nearly 100% electric passenger vehicle sales. China is at 50% of new vehicles being electric. Nepal — Nepal! Sherpas and Mount Everest Nepal! — is seeing 70% of new cars being fully electric now. Europe, China, and the rest of the world have decided that electric is not optional, it is inevitable.

Canada’s Big Three subsidiaries seem to be the last ones clinging desperately to internal combustion engines. Their request to Prime Minister Carney is transparently regressive, like Kodak asking governments to ban digital photography or Blockbuster demanding protection from streaming.

Ironically, these automakers’ insistence on business-as-usual threatens precisely the thing they claim to want: a prosperous Canadian automotive sector. Instead of confronting their own stagnation, they have elected to hold Canada hostage. The message is stark: give us special dispensation to fail, or our factories will fall silent and perhaps be withdrawn entirely. At least it’s an honest threat, albeit breathtakingly entitled.

Meanwhile, China, the world’s EV leader, has quietly marched into global markets with precisely the vehicles Canada needs. Chinese companies like BYD and Yutong are not promising future EV models…",https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1200/1*HvCP3ICBlIqrSlgxBrgjJA.png,N,,2025-10-17 17:08:15.282414

In a letter to Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Lee Zeldin, the senators condemned the administration’s decision to cancel $7 billion in Solar for All funding in August. The program would have created tens of thousands of good-paying jobs in communities across the country, lowered residential electricity bills by at least 20 percent for more than 900,000 households, and saved working families more than $8.7 billion in electric costs over the lifetime of the panels.

“Your agency’s decision to terminate Solar for All is not only unlawful — given this funding was congressionally appropriated and fully obligated — but also ill-timed. Energy bills are soaring across the country and millions of families are facing higher living costs. Electricity bills are 6.2 percent higher than this time last year, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. EPA’s reckless decision to terminate Solar for All directly undermines efforts by Congress to reduce energy costs and improve grid resilience. It jeopardizes economic investments and inflicts severe job losses across the country while undermining the trust and financial certainty that communities, businesses, and local governments have placed in the federal government,” the senators wrote.

This joint letter, led by Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT), follows a letter sent by Senators Kelly and Gallego, Governor Katie Hobbs, and Representatives Greg Stanton and Yassamin Ansari when the program cancellation was first announced in August.

“The EPA’s illegal termination of Solar for All has left states, communities, and businesses across the country in limbo, with critical projects stalled and vulnerable households facing higher energy costs. We demand the EPA immediately reinstate the Solar for All program, rectify the damage caused by this termination, and ensure grantees can proceed with the swift implementation of residential solar projects to slash utility bills and create many thousands of good jobs. In the meantime, we require a full accounting of how the EPA will rectify the damage caused by this program’s disruptive termination,” the senators concluded. “The American people deserve transparency, accountability, and a government that honors its commitments.”

Washington, D.C. – A new resource from Climate Power revealed that Trump’s decision to cancel or threaten billions of dollars in investments in both red and blue states across the country will put 338,150 good-paying jobs and over $23.88 billion in total grant awards on the chopping block. These investments would have created more energy at a time when skyrocketing demand is sending utility bills through the roof. Household electric bills are up 10% nationally since Trump took office, and they are rising at twice the rate of inflation. Now, Trump and Republicans are making it worse by laying off workers and spiking costs for American families.

“The Trump administration is vindictively and callously destroying more than 300,000 good-paying American jobs, once again bending the knee to the fossil fuel industry instead of meeting the needs of the American people,” said Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer. “By canceling hundreds of DOE projects, Trump is ripping away billions of dollars that were flowing to both Republican and Democratic states to support domestic manufacturing, expanding our grid and energy supply, and so much more. Much of this funding stemmed from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which passed the Senate with support from 15 of my Republican colleagues that still serve in the Senate. We cannot let this stand. Americans know that canceling a project that is already underway is not how you save money, it is a waste, and it will only serve to drive up costs, kill jobs, and hurt American industry and investor confidence.”

In Leader Schumer’s state of New York, Trump has canceled or threatened 43 grants representing $338 million in investments.

“Are Americans better off than they were before Trump took office? Not if pink slips and utility bills are the measure,” said Climate Power Communications Director Alex Glass. “Every single Republican member of Congress needs to answer for the damage Trump has done to their communities.

By Mathieu Dion

General Motors Co. and a partner have paused the second phase of a cathode factory in Quebec, resulting in the cancellation of a nickel sulfate project by Vale SA.

GM agreed in 2022 to buy nickel supplies from the Brazilian miner as part of a strategy to build up its battery supply chain for electric vehicles. But weaker-than-expected demand and U.S. policy changes that make EVs less attractive have prompted companies to reconsider investment projects.

The automaker said this week it’s incurring US$1.6 billion in charges tied to its pullback from electric vehicles. Realigning EV capacity will lead to non-cash impairment and other charges of US$1.2 billion, the automaker said in a regulatory filing, while the rest of the costs relate to cancelling contracts and settling commercial arrangements linked to EV investments.

“GM’s long-term strategy is to build a profitable EV business in North America and in light of evolving market dynamics, GM and our partners will pause the second phase of the project,” which involved increasing production capacity of cathode active material, a GM spokesperson said in an emailed statement. The decision was reported earlier by the Canadian Broadcasting Corp.

The Detroit company’s partner in the Quebec venture is South Korea’s Posco Future M Co. The first phase is on track to begin producing material for EV batteries next year, the spokesperson said.

Vale said in a separate statement that GM’s move means it won’t need nickel sulfate for now. “As a result, Vale Base Metals must terminate its nickel sulfate plant project,” which was expected to cost $325 million.

Becancour, Quebec, has emerged as an electric-vehicle battery hub, but a number of projects have now been delayed, including a more than $1.2 billion cathode plant of the battery-materials maker Ecopro Group. Ford Motor Co. was initially part of that project, but pulled out.

The Trump administration said in August it would end the program as part of an effort to save money for the taxpayers.

Under the program written into the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, the money was distributed to 60 entities including states, nonprofits, tribes and local governments.

The Trump EPA argued that provisions in this year’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act that repealed “unobligated” balances of the program allowed it to take the funds back.

The states, in their suit, noted the provision only applies to “unobligated” funds and says that all of the funds in question had actually been obligated.

“Congress did not, however, rescind any funds that had been obligated by ‘the day before the date of enactment’ of H.R. 1, which is July 3, 2025. All of the funds awarded To Plaintiffs were obligated by August 16, 2024,” they wrote.

“Beyond the fact that this energy infrastructure funding has already been appropriated to our state and is owed to Arizonans, protecting solar projects and lower electricity bills is personal to me,” Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes said in a statement.

“Arizona families are already facing sky-high electricity bills, and I will not let the EPA wriggle out of its commitment to fund solar energy projects that would lower costs for more than 11,000 Arizona households,” Mayes said.

The suits came from Arizona, Washington state, Minnesota, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and D.C.

Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear (D), Pennsylvania Energy Development Authority Chair Jessica Shirley and the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation also joined the suit.

The development community touted the $500 million plant as a big win for St. Louis.
Neil Richardson, CEO and chairman of the St. Louis Development Corporation at the time, called the project a testament to the city’s investment into workforce development.
“We are starting to see a renaissance of our advanced manufacturing industries in north St. Louis city that will drive growth across the entire region,” Richardson said in 2024.
The Missouri Coalition for the Environment released a report on the project earlier this year calling it a compounding of environmental racism in north St. Louis.","A north St. Louis $500 million development planned to create more than 150 jobs is now in doubt after Trump administration cuts to energy grants across the country.

The Department of Energy has rescinded a $197 million federal grant planned to help ICL Group Ltd., an Israeli company that also operates a battery plant in Carondelet, build a new plant near the north riverfront in St. Louis.

The company reported on the possibility of discontinuing the project in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing last week and estimated it could garner a $40 million investment write-off if it did. However, no final decision has been made, the report stated.

Company officials could not immediately be reached for comment Friday.

In the report to shareholders, ICL states the Department of Energy’s decision is a result of a comprehensive review of funding eligibility for a number of projects that had received grants in the renewable energy sector and elsewhere. The company originally received the grant through a 2021 infrastructure bill during the Biden administration.

ICL group planned to produce materials for lithium batteries at the plant at 460 E. Carrie Ave. The group touted it as the first large-scale plant of its kind in the country. ICL planned to complete the project next year.

The project’s grant is just one of many facing the ax under the Trump administration and Energy Secretary Chris Wright’s plans. Wright said the slashes to the grants will cut $7.5 billion in spending through the termination of 321 financial awards funding 223 projects across the country.

In a statement, Wright called cutting the projects a “critical task” for the Trump administration.

The development community touted the $500 million plant as a big win for St. Louis. Neil Richardson, CEO and chairman of the St. Louis Development Corporation at the time, called the project a testament to the city’s investment into workforce development.

“We are starting to see a renaissance of our advanced manufacturing industries in north St. Louis city that will drive growth across the entire region,” Richardson said in 2024.

On Friday, SLDC spokesman Deion Broxton said the corporation hadn’t received any official confirmation from ICL or the federal government on the plant’s future.

The project had critics. Some community members and environmental groups pushed back against the development over environmental concerns and complaints of environmental racism.

The Missouri Coalition for the Environment released a report on the project earlier this year calling it a compounding of environmental racism in north St. Louis. The report noted the battery plant’s location on the north riverfront would put it in the middle of neighborhoods experiencing a high asthma hospitalization rate.

They pointed to a 2019 report, Environmental Racism in St. Louis, that showed most of the city’s air pollution sources are in predominantly Black neighborhoods.

The group’s policy coordinator, Maxine Gill, said the coalition is concerned about Trump’s freezing of renewable energy project grants but called ICL’s proposed development an “environmental injustice.”

“ICL misused President Biden’s Justice40 Executive Order to place a polluting facility in an already overburdened neighborhood, rather than ensuring that pollution is diverted from marginalized communities as the executive order intended,” she said Friday. “If they choose to cancel their project, we are glad that ICL will not further pollute a neighborhood with some of the highest hospitalization rates for asthma in the city.”

Previously, the Planned Industrial Expansion Authority, a development board of the SLDC, awarded the project a 90%, 10-year property tax abatement and touted the program as part of the city’s Economic Justice Action Plan to invest in marginalized areas in St. Louis.

“We will continue to assess the situation,” Broxton said.

That EV boom wasn’t just limited to the U.S., though: Global EV sales hit an all-time high of 2.1 million in September. Two-thirds of those sales were in China, the world’s largest EV market.

And yet, there’s still talk of an “EV retreat,” both in the U.S. and abroad. Automakers have expressed concerns about their EV profits, and policymakers in Canada and the European Union are pausing, or adjusting, their EV mandates.

There’s an “inherent duality of the market moment we’re in,” says Corey Cantor, research director of the Zero Emissions Transportation Association. “On the one hand, EV sales are higher than they have ever been, and yet automakers still remain concerned.”

Here’s why, and what’s going on in the electric vehicle landscape.

EV rush before tax credits expired

EVs counted for nearly 11% of total vehicle sales in the U.S. between July and September. That’s a big increase from the same time period last year, when their share was 8.6%, according to Cox Automotive, which recently released data about the country’s third quarter EV sales.

That jump wasn’t a surprise—it was expected, experts say. Americans were rushing to buy EVs before the federal tax credits expired on September 30.

The tax credits, part of President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act, offered up to $7,500 back for Americans who bought a new EV, if the cars they purchased met certain conditions. There was also a credit of up to $4,000 available for used EVs.

President Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” eliminated those tax credits, killing what analysts say was a “key catalyst” for EV adoption. EVs are still seen as a “premium” purchase; in August, the average EV cost more than $57,000, according to Cox—$9,000 more than a similar gas car.

Concerns about future growth

Not every automaker benefited from all those third quarter EV sales, either. Cox Automotive notes that Mercedes-Benz EV sales in that time period were “mostly flat” year-over-year, and Toyota and Nissan sold fewer EVs during that boom than they did in the third quarter of 2024.

Despite the backlash Tesla has been dealing with throughout 2025, that carmaker actually saw an 8% sales increase year-over-year, but its share of total EV sales has fallen. Tesla once made up 49% of all EV sales in the third quarter of 2024, but its share this past quarter was 41%.

Volkswagen, General Motors, Honda, and Hyundai had notable increases in their EV sales. Volkswagen and GM’s sales were more than double the levels one year ago.

But those automakers still have concerns. This week, GM said it was taking a $1.6 billion hit from changing its EV rollout in the U.S. It changed its rollout in part because of Trump’s elimination of the tax credits, and his move to loosen emissions regulations.

advertisement

These policies make the future far less certain for automakers. “Federal policies could tighten again in a couple of years or remain the same,” Cantor says. “The federal policy pathway is far less clear moving forward than it was a year ago.”

One thing experts do expect is that U.S. EV sales will slump after this quarter, because that surge to purchase before the tax credits expired “pulled forward” sales that would have been spread out over more time. Cox Automotive forecasts that EV sales will “drop notably” in Q4 and through the early months of 2026.

EV struggles worldwide

Changing U.S. policies aren’t only affecting the EV sales outlook here. Trump’s tariffs are also adding costs for automakers in international markets, like Canada and across the European Union.

The EU recently said it would review its 2035 target for cutting car emissions to zero. A policy note published before those talks highlighted challenges for the European car industry, “ including higher tariffs on shipments to the U.S.,” the Wall Street Journal reported, as well as low profit margins for EVs and the growth of cheaper Chinese offerings.

China has been dominating the EV market, not just in its own country but worldwide, in part because it offers extremely affordable EVs—some priced as low as $10,000.

But that could make the market oversaturated. While Chinese EV sales are increasing, that growth is happening more and more “at the expense of profitability,” the Wall Street Journal notes; more than 110 EV brands operated there in 2023, and they likely won’t all last.

Hope for the future

Even before Trump’s policies, there was talk of an EV sales slump in 2024. That’s because while sales were increasing, the rate at which they were growing slowed—a common issue for all new technologies as they vie for mainstream appeal. Early adopters drive that beginning growth, and then the industry has to figure out how to attract everyone else.

Now, changing federal policies are making that next step even more difficult. But EV experts still have hope.

“We’d expect the impact of these policy changes to be most acute during the forthcoming year,” Cantor says. “Overall, the global move towards electric vehicles continues.” The International Energy Agency said in May that it expects one in four cars sold worldwide this year to be electric.

Cox Automotive says EV sales are the future, too. “Cx Automotive continues to believe that over the long term—the next 10 years or more—sales of vehicles powered solely by internal combustion engines will continue to decline,” the company wrote in its Q3 EV sales report. “Electrified vehicles—hybrids, plug-in hybrids and pure EVs—are the future.”

We might not get to that future as fast as EV advocates hoped, though. Biden set a goal for EVs to make up 50% of all vehicle sales by 2030. Cox now says EV sales can hit 25% by then. So growth will be slower, “but certainly moving out of the ‘niche’ category,” Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of industry insights at Cox, wrote in September.

And though the future of U.S. federal policy is up in the air, experts still say innovations will advance to help the EV market. “Continued innovation in battery technology, improved transparency in battery health and expanding infrastructure give reason for optimism,” Valdez Streaty wrote. “The road ahead will be challenging, but progress will continue.”","https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024/wp-cms-2/2025/10/p-1-91423972-ev-sales-figures.jpg",N,,2025-10-17 15:03:00.482957

Residents of other states can visit the Database of State Incentives for Renewables & Efficiency to search for incentives in your area.
Whether it’s installing solar panels or upgrading your home’s energy efficiency, now is the time to invest in clean energy and save money on rising electric bills by taking advantage of these clean energy tax credits.","As we approach the end of 2025, time is running out to take advantage of valuable energy efficiency and clean energy tax credits expanded under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 that were repealed by President Donald Trump and Congress this year. These incentives make clean energy investments and energy-saving upgrades more affordable for homeowners, renters and businesses to help better manage energy costs. But with many of them set to phase out or change significantly after 2025, now is the time to act.

Here’s how you can make the most of energy tax opportunities before they’re gone:

1. Install Solar Panels on Your Home

The Residential Clean Energy Credit offers a 30% federal tax credit for the cost of installing solar panels, solar water heaters and other eligible systems. This credit can significantly lower the upfront cost of switching to solar power.

2. Upgrade to Energy-Efficient HVAC and AppliancesThe Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit allows you to claim up to $3,200 annually for energy-saving upgrades. This includes:

Up to $2,000 for high-efficiency heat pumps and water heaters

Up to $1,200 for energy-efficient home improvements including insulation

Up to $600 for energy-efficient windows

Up to $150 for a home energy audit

✅ Act Now: Systems and improvements completed by Dec. 31, 2025, are eligible for the credits. After 2025, the credits are scheduled to expire unless Congress extends them.

3. Take Advantage of State and Local Incentives

Federal tax credits often stack with state or utility rebates, which can lower your costs even further. Many states offer rebates for:

Solar panel installations

Heat pumps

Weatherization

EV charging stations

Virginia just launched Virginia Energy Connect, a new online platform that consolidates federal, state and local energy incentive programs into a single hub where users can quickly identify relevant opportunities and understand application requirements.

North Carolina residents can utilize the Energy Saver NC website that helps income-eligible homeowners and renters across the state cover the cost of energy efficiency and electrification upgrades. The program is currently only available for Western North Carolina counties, but will soon be expanded to the rest of the state.

Customers of the Local Power Companies in the Tennessee Valley Authority region can use the Energy Right hub to manage energy costs by taking advantage of the incentives, rebates and tools it offers.

Residents of other states can visit the Database of State Incentives for Renewables & Efficiency to search for incentives in your area.

4. Small Businesses and Landlords: Don’t Miss Out

If you own rental property, farm or a small business, you may qualify for commercial clean energy tax credits, which have a different timeline for expiration due to the One Big Beautiful Bill Act rolling back a number of clean energy tax incentives.

Commercial tax credits under Section 48E: for wind and solar facilities that begin construction before July 4, 2026 or are placed in service by December 31, 2027. If construction begins before July 4, 2026, the project has 4 years to complete construction.

The Clean Electricity Production Tax Credit under Section 45Y: for wind and solar projects, construction must begin by July 4, 2026, or be placed in service by December 31, 2027. If construction begins before July 4, 2026, the project has 4 years to complete construction.

Energy-efficient commercial building deductions under Section 179D: this credit was modified by the budget reconciliation bill passed in July 2025, creating a termination date for projects that begin construction after June 30, 2026

Dive Brief:

A coalition of 16 Republican state attorneys general sent letters to Amazon, Google, Meta and Microsoft last month, probing the companies’ usage of renewable energy certificates to offset their own energy usage and account for emissions reductions.

The state officials, led by Montana AG Austin Knudsen, said in the Sept. 24 letter they were writing to “raise serious concerns” about the tech companies’ respective claims that they match 100% of their energy usage with renewable energy by utilizing renewable energy certificates that are not tied to a specific project.

The AGs said purchasing these type of certificates, known as unbundled RECs, “does not mean that the companies are using renewable energy, or that they are reducing emissions,” the letter said. The AGs said such claims “appear deceptive” based on rising energy demands from the sector and the current U.S. grid makeup.

Dive Insight:

Renewable energy certificates give companies the rights to “environmental, social and other non-power attributes” of renewables and are obtained when one megawatt-hour of renewable-generated electricity is delivered to the grid, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Unbundled RECs, while not tied to a project, provide renewable energy projects additional sources of income to keep projects operating and incentivize new generation, according to trade group American Council on Renewable Energy.

In their letter, the attorneys general probed each company’s usage of unbundled RECs, including questions about how they analyzed if additional generation would come online; their energy usage for each of the five years, without considering RECs; how such certificates are used to calculate the company’s energy usage and scope 2 emissions. The AGs also asked the companies how they use RECs to substantiate public energy usage and emissions reductions claims.

“Major tech companies use unbundled RECs to claim that they have achieved 100% renewable energy ‘use’ or ‘consumption,’ and have reduced their emissions,” the letter said. “Both types of claims appear to be deceptive or misleading.”

In addition to Knudsen, attorneys general from Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Indiana, Iowa, Florida, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, West Virginia and Wyoming signed on.

The use of unbundled renewable energy certificates is credited as a part of each of the companies’ respective strategies for matching energy usage with renewable energy. Unbundled RECs represent “a growing proportion of total renewable project revenue” and are “the primary way for many entities to claim the environmental attributes represented by renewable electricity,” according to ACORE.

Amazon said in an email to ESG Dive Friday that it has received and is reviewing the letter from the state AGs. Additionally, it said it expects the number of unbundled RECs it purchases will decrease over time as additional projects come online.

Amazon announced last year that it matched 100% of its operational electricity usage with renewable energy in 2023, seven years ahead of its 2030 target. The e-commerce and tech company said at the time that it invested in more than 500 renewable energy projects, but also said it purchases both bundled — which are purchased in connection to a project — and unbundled RECs. Amazon said the usage of RECs allows it, and any other renewable energy purchaser, to account for energy it has bought, the company said in a 2024 blog post explaining how it reached its goal.

“No company with complex and growing operations is able today to only consume renewable energy — there simply aren’t enough sources in enough locations, and it takes a while for new projects to come online,” the blog said. “Like most companies with ambitious climate goals like ours, we also purchase RECs.”

Google said it first matched 100% of its operational electricity with renewable energy in 2017 by annually purchasing the same amount of renewable energy, through physical energy purchases and RECs, as it uses in megawatt-hours. The company also has a goal to run on 24/7 carbon-free energy on every grid it operates in by 2030 and reported reaching 70% hourly matching in the U.S. in 2024 in its latest sustainability report.

Meta also said in its most recent sustainability report it has maintained net-zero across its scope 1 and scope 2 emissions since 2020. The social media and tech conglomerate said it achieved that goal by becoming one of largest corporate procurers of renewable energy and making renewable procurement a key part of that strategy.

Microsoft has a goal to hit net-zero across its operations by 2025, which it plans to achieve through energy efficiency, decarbonization and reaching “100% direct renewable electricity by 2025,” according to a sustainability fact sheet. Microsoft said in the fact sheet it “procures enough renewable electricity to match 100% of our global electricity consumption” and, when it is unable to do so in markets it operates in, will look to purchase an equivalent volume of renewable electricity from nearby markets.

By Jack Wittels

The world’s shipping regulator postponed a decision on adopting a landmark charge on vessel emissions, a shock move that highlights the Trump administration’s efforts to disrupt international climate diplomacy.

The postponement marks a setback for multilateral environmental regulations ahead of next month’s COP30 climate summit in Brazil.

Countries gathered at the International Maritime Organization’s London headquarters this week to decide on whether to make ships start paying for the more than 1 billion tons of greenhouse gases they emit each year. On Friday, they voted to push back that ballot for a year, following a proposal put forward by Saudi Arabia.

Industry insiders had previously expected the rules to pass, despite United States pressure. They’ve been years in the making, and would be the world’s first global, fixed charge on emissions for any industry. They would also pave the way for the end of oil as shipping’s dominant fuel and opened the door for cleaner alternatives like ammonia.

While the plan had clear international support back in April, that wavered this week as the U.S. dialed up pressure, threatening wide-ranging measures against those who backed the planned rules that President Donald Trump on Thursday said he was “outraged” about.

The International Chamber of Shipping, representing over 80 per cent of the world’s fleet, said it was disappointed with the result, and that uncertainty over the plan’s future threatens investments needed to make the sector cleaner.

US Pressure

The decision’s delay demonstrates the effect that pressure from the Trump administration can have. The U.S. strongly opposed the ship emissions charges, calling them a “global carbon tax” on Americans and warning of “disastrous” economic impacts. It had urged other nations to reject the regulations from “an unaccountable UN organization,” saying some estimates had forecast shipping costs to jump as much as 10 per cent or more.

The State Department had said it would consider measures such as port levies, visa restrictions, commercial penalties and sanctions on officials. It also previously mentioned tariffs as part of potential responses, though it became unclear if they remained on the table.

Trump said the U.S. wouldn’t adhere to the carbon tax “in any way, shape, or form,” and that he was “outraged” that the IMO was holding a vote.

The U.S. also put pressure on the plans this week by asking for another step in adopting the charge if countries voted in favour of it — proposing nations explicitly opt in after the vote in a shift from a “tacit acceptance” process. That would effectively add a further hurdle for them coming into force.

There were signs of wavering this week. Bloomberg reported Thursday that Athens, which had long been skeptical about the plan because of the impact on its maritime industry, was considering abstaining.

On Friday, Singapore — previously a supporter of the plan — proposed that nations delay voting on the charge. That was backed by Saudi Arabia, which was already against the rule.

Climate Impact

The plan’s failure is another example of the challenges that international climate diplomacy and regulation face. The Trump administration has been dismantling its domestic climate policy and attempting to disrupt efforts to cut emissions globally. Companies have also ditched climate commitments over the past year as the reality of meeting ambitious time frames becomes clear and the marketing benefits of having green credentials fade.

Though Trump has pulled the U.S. out of the Paris climate agreement, the withdrawal only takes formal effect in 2026. In practice, the U.S. will still be able to block efforts to reach consensus at the COP30 talks in November.

The maritime industry accounts for over four-fifths of the world’s trade and more than one per cent of all emissions, and the carbon levy was a key part of the IMO’s push for international shipping to reach net zero by around mid-century.

That goal now looks more difficult to achieve.

“We are disappointed that member states have not been able to agree a way forward at this meeting,” International Chamber of Shipping Secretary General Thomas Kazakos said in a statement. “Industry needs clarity to be able to make the investments needed to decarbonize the maritime sector, in line with the goals set out in the IMO GHG strategy.”

Moreover, this half of the funding would be split between the New Water Supply for Texas Fund and the State Water Implementation Fund for Texas (SWIFT).
To learn more about how to get engaged in regional planning, read our previous blogs about the State Water Plan and the State Flood Plan.
Proposition 4 would set up automatic deposits to the Texas Water Fund, which may limit legislative oversight, transparency, and adaptability to emergencies.","Proposition 4, which is set to appear on the ballot this fall, proposes a constitutional amendment that would allocate $1 billion annually to the Texas Water Fund starting in 2027 and through 2047. This proposition has sparked both hope and concern for Texas’ water future. In this blog, we will address several common concerns about Proposition 4.

At least half of the annual funding will be directed to controversial new water supply projects.

Proposition 4 allows funding for a wide range of new water supply projects, some of which raise serious concerns for public health and the environment - like oil and gas wastewater reuse and seawater desalination projects. However, this proposition also makes funding available for sustainable new water supply projects, such as aquifer storage and recovery (ASR) and water and wastewater reuse. Moreover, this half of the funding would be split between the New Water Supply for Texas Fund and the State Water Implementation Fund for Texas (SWIFT). The SWIFT funds regionally approved projects listed in the State Water Plan, which include many sustainable solutions like water conservation, water infrastructure improvements, nature-based solutions, and others. With at least part of this portion of the funding tied to projects approved by Texas communities, the potential for positive impact is real - but only if Texans come together to advocate for the money to be directed away from controversial projects.

Proposition 4 would make it easier to advance controversial projects like the Marvin Nichols Reservoir, water transfer from East Texas, and expansion of seawater desalination.

Proposition 4 does not favor any specific type of project, nor does it establish criteria for how projects will be prioritized. This makes public participation critically important. Much of the decision-making will happen through regional planning groups and TWDB established processes, which are open to the public. We encourage people to attend TWDB’s public meetings and get involved in regional water planning, where Texans help determine which projects move forward and best serve the needs of their communities. To learn more about how to get engaged in regional planning, read our previous blogs about the State Water Plan and the State Flood Plan. The more Texans speak up, the harder it is to ignore community needs and push political or industry agendas.

Funding allocation decisions will rest with the Texas Water Development Board (TWDB), which includes governor-appointed members.

We understand the concern that funding allocation decisions could be politically driven. That’s why public participation and advocacy are critically important - especially if Proposition 4 passes. It’s important to remember that many projects must go through established processes like public meetings, hearings, and comment periods, offering opportunities for community input. If Texans show up and speak up, the outcomes can change. The recent stalling of the Inner Harbor seawater desalination plant in Corpus Christi is an excellent example how public involvement can drive the desired change, even in the face of pressure from special interests and the support from the governor. For our part, we will continue to monitor how funds are allocated, attend public meetings, and engage with agencies like TWDB and TCEQ to ensure transparency and accountability.

Proposition 4 would set up automatic deposits to the Texas Water Fund, which may limit legislative oversight, transparency, and adaptability to emergencies.

Proposition 4 brings a long-term funding stream, but it doesn’t lock the Texas Legislature out. The automatic transfer simply creates predictable funding. The Legislature must still pass a budget bill every two years to authorize the appropriations. An additional provision outlined in the House Joint Resolution 7 (HJR 7) - from which Proposition 4 has resulted - allows the Legislature to temporarily suspend deposits during a declared state of disaster, thus giving the state flexibility to respond to emergencies. To ensure transparency in the spending process, the enabling legislation - Senate Bill 7 (SB 7) - established the Texas Water Fund Advisory Committee, composed of legislators and agency representatives, to oversee spending and make recommendations that keep investments transparent and aligned with the state’s water needs. In addition, the Legislature is free to make additional appropriations beyond the $1 billion to address specific needs or even projects if money is available from state or federal revenues.

Proposition 4 may take money away from other priorities.

Proposition 4 doesn’t raise taxes or take money away from existing priorities, like transportation or education. It uses surplus state sales tax revenue, money that’s only allocated once collections exceed $46.5 billion in a given year. In other words, this is extra money that the state already has, and Proposition 4 would direct $1 billion each year to water needs.

But the workers responsible for carrying out the president’s plans for more fossil fuels and less wind and solar power are still hard at work. Some are approving permits for companies that want to extract metals, coal, oil and gas from public lands and federal waters. Others are rolling back limits on the greenhouse gas emissions that are driving climate change.

On Thursday the Bureau of Land Management approved the expansion of a copper mine on public land in Utah. Earlier this week the Interior Department prepared to open more than 250,000 acres of land in Wyoming and Nebraska to oil drilling, and held a coal lease sale for access to Montana’s Powder River Basin. And at the Environmental Protection Agency, employees are finalizing a plan to allow more mercury emissions from coal plants, according to two people familiar with the work underway.

Charlotte Taylor, a spokeswoman for the Interior Department, said the agency was doing what was necessary in light of President Trump’s declaration in January of a national energy emergency.

“Work related to permitting, leasing and other essential energy operations is continuing as excepted work to help strengthen the nation’s energy security, maintain reliable supplies and protect American consumers from disruption,” Ms. Taylor said.

Most experts say that there is no national energy emergency, pointing to record amounts of oil and gas that is being produced in the United States. Electricity demand, however, is on the rise, driven largely by the explosion of data centers as well as population growth and the rise of artificial intelligence applications. At the same time, the Trump administration has been trying to slow or stop the expansion of renewable energy that could add to the nation’s electricity supply.

“If this is truly about keeping the lights on, then why suppress the cleanest and cheapest energy that’s coming online?” said Alexandra Adams, chief policy advocacy officer for the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group.

The continuation of work on fossil fuel projects during the shutdown is both legal and appropriate, said Rachel Cauley, a spokeswoman for the Office of Management and Budget.

“Approving energy development is no different than keeping open national parks — it can be done to the extent funds are available and at some point money will run out,” Ms. Cauley said. She blamed Democrats for the shutdown, which she said has forced Mr. Trump “to pick and choose which programs to fund with the dwindling dollars that remain carried over from last year.”

Mr. Trump “is showing us exactly who and what matters to him, which is industry executives and his political allies,” said Stephanie Kurose, deputy director of government affairs at the Center for Biological Diversity, an environmental group.

At the Energy Department, nearly 200 employees were told last week that their jobs were being eliminated. At the same time, department employees approved a plan to improve electric transmission lines across Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma and West Virginia.

Most Environmental Protection Agency employees have been working through the shutdown. Union officials believe the agency has been able to do that by tapping into appropriated funds that have carried over from the previous funding period, but E.P.A. officials have declined to answer questions about what money they are using or how long it will last.

Employees working on weakening or repealing regulations that the Trump administration has called burdensome to oil, gas and coal companies have been told to press on, according to two E.P.A. officials who asked not to be named because they were not authorized to discuss agency work.

While renewable investment grew 7% in 2024, actual disbursements remain well below what is needed to sustain project pipelines and accelerate deployment.
IRENA and its partners warn that fair and transparent trade practices must be secured for key materials and technologies to ensure stable supply chains.
To support the transition, around USD 670 billion per year must be directed toward grid modernisation and expansion by 2030, alongside rapid investment in energy storage and system flexibility to support renewable integration and grid stability.
As the world heads toward COP30 in Brazil, the report delivers a clear message: record progress is not enough — only unprecedented acceleration will deliver the promise of the UAE Consensus and keep global climate goals alive.","The world is not moving fast enough to meet its renewable energy and efficiency targets, despite a record year for clean energy expansion, according to a new report released by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), the COP30 Brazilian Presidency, and the Global Renewables Alliance (GRA).

The Delivering on the UAE Consensus progress report, unveiled at a pre-COP30 high-level event in Brasília, finds that while 2024 saw an unprecedented 582 gigawatts (GW) of renewable energy added globally, the pace remains far short of what is needed to meet the COP28 UAE Consensus goal of tripling renewables capacity to 11.2 terawatts (TW) by 2030.

To stay on track, the world must now add a staggering 1,122 GW of new renewable capacity each year from 2025 onwards — requiring annual growth to accelerate to 16.6% throughout the remainder of the decade.

Energy efficiency progress is equally off pace. The report shows that global energy intensity improved by just 1% in 2024, well below the 4% annual improvement required to meet the UAE Consensus goal of doubling efficiency by 2030 and keeping the 1.5°C target within reach.

Urgent Call for Action

The report urges governments to integrate renewable targets into their national climate plans (NDC 3.0) ahead of COP30 in Belém, double their collective ambition to align with global goals, and significantly increase renewable investment. Between 2025 and 2030, at least USD 1.4 trillion in annual investment will be needed — more than twice the USD 624 billion recorded in 2024,

G20 nations, which are expected to account for over 80% of global renewables by 2030, are called upon to take the lead. The report highlights that G7 countries, in particular, must boost their share to around 20% of global capacity by the end of the decade while delivering on international climate finance commitments.

That includes meeting the new collective quantified goal (NCQG) of USD 300 billion per year and scaling up towards the aspirational USD 1.3 trillion figure confirmed at COP29 in Azerbaijan.

Beyond Renewables: Grids, Supply Chains, and Clean Tech

The report also stresses the urgent need to expand and modernise electricity grids, strengthen renewable supply chains, and scale clean-tech manufacturing in areas such as solar, wind, batteries, and hydrogen.

While renewable investment grew 7% in 2024, actual disbursements remain well below what is needed to sustain project pipelines and accelerate deployment. IRENA and its partners warn that fair and transparent trade practices must be secured for key materials and technologies to ensure stable supply chains.

Haustveit oversees Fossil Energy and National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) programs and manages a $5 billion research development portfolio that includes coal, oil, natural gas and critical minerals with the objective of advancing affordable and reliable energy solutions, according to the Department of Energy.
“Without more energy and without more reliable energy, America will face an energy disaster with affordability and reliability issues unlike anything we’ve experienced since the advent of electricity,” he said.
“As we improve our grid, we are committed to loading it with record supplies of reliable energy, including coal, nuclear and natural gas.
Make no mistake, the prior administration’s war on coal and neglect of nuclear energy are over,” he said.","The U.S. will need more reliable energy sources than ever before and the Trump administration will deliver, an assistant secretary at the U.S. Department of Energy said at a summit Thursday.

The Louisiana Energy Security Summit 2025 in New Orleans featured U.S. Sen. Bill Cassidy along with keynote speaker Kyle Haustveit and brought 70 thought leaders from around the country to discuss the state’s role in advancing U.S. energy dominance in the face of evolving global challenges.

“The president and our administration are determined to unleash greater energy production than ever before, utilizing every reliable energy source at our disposal,” said Haustveit, assistant secretary for Fossil Energy Department Management in the U.S. Department of Energy.

“And as we do this, we will unleash unparalleled prosperity across our nation, including this region,” said Haustveit, who addressed the summit by video because of the federal government shutdown.

Haustveit oversees Fossil Energy and National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) programs and manages a $5 billion research development portfolio that includes coal, oil, natural gas and critical minerals with the objective of advancing affordable and reliable energy solutions, according to the Department of Energy.

Haustveit said the previous administration pursued an anti-energy policy. “It restrained both energy production and the building of energy infrastructure such as natural gas pipelines.”

America needs both more energy and more energy diversity, said Haustveit, a North Dakota native whose family has worked in the energy industry for three generations.

“Thanks to the accelerating march of innovation and progress, including the president’s manufacturing revival and the coming rise in AI data center growth, a tidal wave of energy demand is headed our way and is about to wash over this nation and indeed the world,” Haustveit said.

Haustveit said the Energy Department’s Florence Berkeley National Lab estimated last year that data center demand for energy will double or triple by 2028. “The kind of energy we will need for these data centers will be rock solid energy that delivers 24-7 reliability. In other words, if we want to power these data centers and reindustrialize our country, we not only need more energy supply, we also need more energy diversity.,” said Haustveit.

“The United States needs to develop the most reliable energy sources on the planet, including coal and nuclear, oil and natural gas,” said Haustveit. “Without more energy and without more reliable energy, America will face an energy disaster with affordability and reliability issues unlike anything we’ve experienced since the advent of electricity,” he said.

Haustveit said Secretary of Energy Chris Wright has responded to the crisis by issuing eight emergency orders pursuant to Section 202c of the Federal Powers Act that have strengthened grid reliability during peak demand to prevent power outages and saved consumers at least $4.7 million in energy costs.

“We’re looking for stakeholder input on how best to utilize our funding programs and authorities to rapidly expand energy generation and transmission grid capacity,” the assistant secretary said. “As we improve our grid, we are committed to loading it with record supplies of reliable energy, including coal, nuclear and natural gas. Given the AI revolution alone and the coming surge in consumption, there is clearly no alternative to the pro energy course we are taking,” said Haustveit.

Haustveit said Energy Department leadership team has identified 16 potential sites at national labs and other DOE-owned land for AI data center development.

“We support removing regulations that constrain AI development, and we are unleashing DOE resources and the innovation of our national labs to ensure we have the resources to power the AI revolution. But again, none of this can be sustained without an unprecedented surge in energy supply,” said Haustveit.

Haustveit said the department is laser focused on fulfilling the president’s mandates on nuclear energy. He said the focus is on enabling the rapid deployment and export of next generation nuclear technology, bringing down operating costs for existing reactors, expanding the application of nuclear energy beyond electricity to support manufacturing and industry, strengthening nuclear fuel infrastructure, restarting reactors that were prematurely closed, and cutting regulations that have stifled the industry.

“Streamlining the permitting process will ensure nuclear developers get steel in the ground faster,” Hustveit said. “As vice chair of the new National Energy Dominance Council, Secretary Wright is working closely with the chair, Interior Secretary [Doug] Burgum, and other council members to unleash American energy through permitting reform. Make no mistake, the prior administration’s war on coal and neglect of nuclear energy are over,” he said.

Haustveit said the administration will also “unleash” another base load resource, natural gas.

“We are on the cusp of an LNG revolution that will fill the world with our LNG bounty. Several of the LNG export authorizations processed during the first Trump administration have now become actual exports, including the Plaquemines LNG project right here in Louisiana that has just come online,” said Haustveit.

Hospitality workers won a number of major victories including a $20/hour minimum wage—with increases that will bring workers to $22/hour by the end of the contract—job security protections, improved housekeeping workloads and improved safety standards. “This victory is an attestation of our members’ strength, their will, and determination. They held the line for over a month in the heat and rain, as they fought to secure better standards after being left behind for so long.

Nursing assistants, respiratory therapists, environmental services, food services, x-ray technicians, respiratory therapists and other essential staff voted overwhelmingly earlier this month to authorize a work stoppage in response to bad faith bargaining from Sutter executives. The power of their unity paid off, and members will now vote on a deal that includes wins like a 14% across-the-board raise, protections for health care and retirement benefits, and more. “This tentative agreement shows that when we stand united, we can win improvements that protect both healthcare workers and our patients,” said Dinora Garcia, a dietary clerk from Sutter Lakeside Hospital in Lakeport. “Reaching this agreement wasn’t easy but we stood together to advocate for worker and patient safety, improved staffing levels, and fair wages and benefits that reflect the vital work we do every day.”

At 3.99%, the newest versions of the Model S and Model X now have the same interest rates as the 2026 Tesla Model Y.
However, our analysis found that 2026 Tesla Model S and Model X lease prices remain completely unchanged.
Tesla raised MSRPs on both the Model S and Model X back in August by roughly $10,000.","Tesla lowered interest rates today on the Model S and Model X to as low as 3.99% APR. It's the most significant change since federal tax credits ended on September 30. While this isn't the best Tesla financing deal that we've ever seen, our analysis found that it could translate to a nearly $4,000 price cut for some EV buyers.

But The Financing Deal Has A Catch

Starting today, all 2026 Tesla Model S and Model X configurations are eligible for 3.99% APR for 72 months. Like past financing deals from Tesla, the catch is that you'll need to make a down payment to get the advertised interest rate. Currently, that's 3% of the purchase price. So on a $100,000 vehicle, that would be $3,000.

With a zero-down loan, the interest rate changes to 4.99%. Both rates are lower than the previous one of 5.14% APR, though the 3.99% deal clearly offers the biggest savings. On a $100,000 vehicle, today's change could translate to a roughly $3,700 price cut, assuming a buyer puts down the 3% minimum down payment.

We've Seen Better Incentives From Tesla

Having said that, we've seen better deals from Tesla. The most competitive offers have involved 0% financing, free FSD, and free Supercharging. However, today's change is far more moderate in our view. At 3.99%, the newest versions of the Model S and Model X now have the same interest rates as the 2026 Tesla Model Y.

For some buyers, we think today's interest rate drops could make it a good time to buy. However, our analysis found that 2026 Tesla Model S and Model X lease prices remain completely unchanged. The cheapest Model S lease has an effective cost of just over $2,000 a month, while the Model X lease comes in at over $2,300.

Both EVs are significantly more expensive after tax credits changed on October 1. While neither one qualified for the credit on purchases, they did take advantage of a $7,500 Commercial Clean Vehicle Credit that made leases more affordable. This month's elimination of the credit caused lease prices to surge up to $242 per month.

Tesla raised MSRPs on both the Model S and Model X back in August by roughly $10,000. The price hikes were largely the result of the inclusion of the standard Luxe Package with benefits like Full Self-Driving and Supercharging. At the time, our analysis found that Tesla's lease prices also increased by approximately 20%.

Her letter also noted that the “delay in issuing the PFNA report coincided with EPA’s decision, in May of this year, to rescind” drinking water limits for PFNA and several other forever chemicals, also known as PFAS.
“This seems to be more than coincidence given that there has been strong industry pushback on regulating PFAS,” Pingree wrote.
“Reading that piece made my blood boil.” Background: PFNA is in drinking water systems serving some 26 million people.
Although it was subject to a voluntary phaseout almost two decades ago, the chemical is now widespread in the environment.","What Happened: The ranking member of a key House subcommittee demanded answers this week from the Environmental Protection Agency about why it has yet to make public a report documenting the health risks posed by a forever chemical found in the water of millions of Americans.

In a letter sent to the EPA on Thursday, Rep. Chellie Pingree, D-Maine, cited a ProPublica story from last week that quoted government scientists saying the report had been ready for publishing in April but had yet to be released. Pingree — the top Democrat on the Appropriations Committee’s Subcommittee on the Interior, Environment and Related Agencies — asked EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin for “clear answers” about why the report had not been made public, who directed its delay and when Zeldin would commit to releasing it.

What They Said: Pingree referred to the delay in publishing the report as part of “a growing pattern of interference with the Agency’s scientific work” and pointed to the Integrated Risk Information System, the EPA program that wrote it. IRIS, which was created during Ronald Reagan’s presidency, analyzes the health harm chemicals can cause. “The Trump Administration, Republicans in Congress, and industry have been hostile to the IRIS program,” she wrote, asking whether scientists had been removed or reassigned from the program and, if so, why.

Her letter also noted that the “delay in issuing the PFNA report coincided with EPA’s decision, in May of this year, to rescind” drinking water limits for PFNA and several other forever chemicals, also known as PFAS. “This seems to be more than coincidence given that there has been strong industry pushback on regulating PFAS,” Pingree wrote.

Pingree noted that the delay appears to contradict Zeldin’s repeated public statements about protecting the public from PFAS compounds, which contaminate soil and water in Maine and throughout the country. “Our state is really hoping for help from the federal government. And when you see the federal government turn their back on you and decide to withhold the data … that’s really discouraging,” she told ProPublica. “Reading that piece made my blood boil.”

Background: PFNA is in drinking water systems serving some 26 million people. The report in question found that the chemical interferes with human development by causing lower birth weights and, based on animal evidence, likely causes damage to the liver and to male reproductive systems, including reductions in testosterone levels, sperm production and the size of reproductive organs.

PFNA was a component of firefighting foam and a processing aid to make a kind of plastic used in circuit boards, valves and pipes. Although it was subject to a voluntary phaseout almost two decades ago, the chemical is now widespread in the environment.

ProPublica’s reporting found that IRIS has been drastically reduced under the Trump administration. The program, which calculates values that can be used to set limits for pollutants in drinking water and cleanup levels for toxic sites, has been a frequent target of industry. Project 2025, the conservative blueprint that has set the direction for President Donald Trump’s second administration, called for IRIS to be eliminated. Earlier this year, Republicans in Congress introduced legislation called the “No IRIS Act.” Of 55 EPA scientists Publica identified as having worked on recent IRIS assessments, only eight remain in the office, according to a source familiar with the program.

Why It Matters: The report calculated the amount of PFNA that people can be exposed to without being harmed — a critical measurement that can be used to set limits for cleaning up PFNA in contaminated areas called Superfund sites and for removing the chemical from drinking water. This calculation will prove critical to communities around the country as they battle polluters over who will pay to remove PFNA and other forever chemicals from the environment.",https://img.assets-d.propublica.org/v5/images/AP22313127406391_maxHeight_3000_maxWidth_3000.jpg?crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&imgixProfile=propublicaAssetsV5&q=90&w=1200&s=f9f15155da7a44eeb89cd7f2e01f3d09,N,,2025-10-17 14:11:02.736112

Minneapolis-based Xcel Energy, which generates and distributes electricity and gas to customers across eight states, seeks proposals for power generation projects to increase the capacity of its Texas-New Mexico electric system.

The company said Oct. 10 it’s working to meet the forecasted increase in demand, as well as the needs of the growing regional economy.

“For more than a century, we’ve had the privilege of powering the growth of this region and supporting the communities and industries that call it home,” said Adrian J. Rodriguez, president of Xcel Energy Texas–New Mexico. “As economic activity continues to expand, we’re planning ahead to ensure we can meet our customers’ growing energy needs with reliable, cost-effective service and a balanced approach to our energy future.”

Xcel on Oct. 10 filed a request for proposals (RFP), opening the competitive bidding process for all sources of new power projects to add more than 2,000 megawatts to the system when those sources are operating at their intended design capacity.

The Texas-New Mexico RFP seeks resources to meet identified power needs from 2030 through 2032, the company said.

“Industries can’t grow without power, so we are taking an all-of-the-above approach to new generation projects,” Rodriguez said. “This process is the first step toward powering new jobs and supporting continued economic growth in our region.”

Xcel Energy operates a diverse mix of power generation facilities in its Texas–New Mexico service area, including conventional power generating stations and large-scale wind installations. The region’s energy mix also includes electricity supplied through power purchase agreements.

The attorneys general of more than a dozen states on Thursday sued the Trump administration over the termination of $7 billion in funding intended for affordable solar energy projects across the U.S.

The coalition, which also included the District of Columbia and other stakeholders, argued in the lawsuit that the Environmental Protection Agency’s cancellation of the Solar for All program violated the law governing federal agencies and the constitutional separation of powers. The program was introduced in 2022 as part of former President Joe Biden’s landmark climate law, intended to make the renewable energy accessible to nearly 1 million Americans.

Increasing the use of solar energy reduces reliance on coal, oil and natural gas. Burning these fossil fuels for electricity is a primary driver of climate change globally because they emit greenhouse gases that trap the Earth’s heat.

The EPA rescinded the Solar for All funds in August after President Donald Trump’s massive tax and spending law passed in Congress a month earlier, with Administrator Lee Zeldin calling the program a “boondoggle.”

The EPA said in an email Thursday that it does not comment on pending litigation.

Thursday’s filing in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington was led by Washington Attorney General Nick Brown, Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison and Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes, and argues the termination of the funding was unlawful. It names the EPA and Zeldin as defendants.

RELATED: Regulators know PG&amp;E, Edison are slow to hook up solar. Why are there no penalties?

Joining the lawsuit are the attorneys general in California, Colorado, Connecticut, the District of Columbia, Hawaii, Illinois, Massachusetts, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island and Vermont, all of whom are Democrats, as well as the governor of Kentucky, the chair of the Pennsylvania Energy Development Authority, and the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation.

“Congress passed a solar energy program to help make electricity costs more affordable, but the administration is ignoring the law and focused on the conspiracy theory that climate change is a hoax,” Brown said in a statement.

Advocates have touted the program not only for its benefits to lower-income communities needing access to money for clean-energy projects, but also for local workforces and to keep electricity prices reasonable.

“At a time when energy bills are at a record high and only continuing to skyrocket, the Trump Administration is needlessly hampering an industry that can produce safe, reliable, and inexpensive energy,” California Attorney General Rob Bonta said in a statement.

A similar group of states filed a separate lawsuit Wednesday in the Court of Federal Claims against the Trump administration arguing that the program funding cancellation is a breach of contract and said they are seeking to recover monetary damages.

This week’s litigation ramps up the pressure on the Trump administration over the program. Nonprofit organizations and other groups sued over Solar for All funding for similar reasoning earlier this month, and Harris County in Texas filed a lawsuit last week over its award. More than two dozen Democratic senators also wrote a letter to Zeldin this week calling for the program to be restored.

Solar for All was affiliated with another $20 billion in green funding, formally known as the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, terminated by the Trump administration in March.

The canceled $27 billion is just one example of the efforts the administration has taken against clean energy. Trump has invested in fossil fuels such as oil, natural gas and coal while slashing climate regulation, standing in the way of clean energy developments and reversing environmental policy.

Challenges and achievements of the LAud framework The case study on implementing the LAud framework at State Grid Jiangsu Electric Power Company faced several challenges.","Lifecycle auditing

The concept of LAud emerged as an extension of continuous auditing (CA), building upon foundational work by Groomer and Murthy16 and Vasarhelyi and Halper17. While early definitions of CA focused on financial reporting, LAud broadens this scope to encompass holistic project oversight. Rezaee et al.18 described CA as a systematic process for gathering electronic audit evidence to evaluate financial statements in real-time systems, a foundation that LAud expands by integrating cross-functional operational data. Eulerich and Kalinichenko19 framed CA as an automated monitoring system for detecting deviations from standards, a concept LAud extends to track multidimensional performance metrics across project lifecycles. In power-grid engineering contexts, LAud leverages advanced technology to enhance the timeliness and accuracy of financial and operational reporting, detect errors and fraud, and provide actionable insights for decision-making11,12,20. This evolution addresses the limitations of traditional risk management methods in power-grid projects, which often lack robust evaluation frameworks13.

Auditors now face demands for real-time assurance not only over financial data but also operational integrity, requiring continuous assessment of control systems for anomalies and risks21,22. Traditional auditing methodologies, designed for periodic reviews, struggle to meet these dynamic requirements23. LAud overcomes these constraints by enabling concurrent monitoring of project schedules, budgets, quality benchmarks, and risk indicators throughout the asset lifecycle24. In power-grid projects, this facilitates immediate corrective actions and proactive risk mitigation through data integration from project management software, financial systems, and operational logs. The principles of LAud build upon those articulated for CA25,26, enhanced for lifecycle applications27. These include:

High-frequency audit cycles aligned with project milestones.

Automated monitoring of technical, financial, and operational parameters.

Exception-based auditing supplemented by human expertise for complex judgments.

Integration of predictive analytics for risk identification in engineering workflows.

Real-time assurance over both financial and non-financial performance indicators.

Continuous data modeling using inputs from IoT sensors, ERP systems, and maintenance records.

As a technology-dependent methodology, LAud requires sophisticated tools for implementation. Auditors employ computer-assisted audit techniques to analyze heterogeneous data streams, assess risks, and validate compliance across project phases28. Successful deployment depends on secure integration with client systems for installing monitoring modules, collecting evidence, and generating alerts29. In power-grid contexts, this necessitates interoperability with specialized engineering platforms and Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems. Critical success factors include executive sponsorship, mature IT infrastructure, adaptive internal audit structures, and workforce upskilling in both audit principles and engineering operations26,30.

The implementation of LAud is particularly valuable in addressing the complex risk landscape of power-grid projects. Effective lifecycle risk management requires integrated systems capable of processing technical, environmental, and financial data streams—a capability inherent in LAud frameworks13. Adoption success depends on technological readiness, regulatory alignment, and organizational culture30,31. Recent studies highlight LAud’s growing relevance in critical infrastructure sectors, where it enhances resilience through continuous compliance monitoring and predictive analytics12,32.

Audit of power grid projects

The audit of power grid projects constitutes a critical mechanism for ensuring operational efficiency, regulatory compliance, and sustainable development in the energy sector. Various dimensions of power-grid auditing emphasize the integration of technical and financial oversight33, while the role of energy audits in optimizing household electricity consumption in Amman, Jordan—a framework adaptable to broader distribution network efficiency34. Zhou et al.35 advanced risk assessment methodologies through a two-layer neural network model capable of processing multi-attribute, low-correlation data, addressing a key challenge in auditing complex infrastructure projects.

LAud extends these foundations by embedding continuous, technology-driven oversight across all project phases. Abdel-Hadi et al.36 laid groundwork for this approach through a holistic audit framework that synthesizes financial, technical, and operational metrics—principles now operationalized in LAud through real-time data integration from SCADA systems, IoT sensors, and project management platforms. Energy performance indicators gain enhanced relevance in LAud frameworks37, where they are dynamically tracked against evolving benchmarks. Early innovations in automation, such as intelligent auditing system38, foreshadowed LAud’s reliance on artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning to minimize human error and accelerate anomaly detection33,39,40.

Diverging from prior literature, this research investigates the implementation of LAud based on a full lifecycle model that integrates:

Design-phase risk forecasting using predictive analytics.

Construction-phase compliance tracking via IoT-enabled progress monitoring.

Operational-phase resilience auditing through SCADA system interoperability.

Post-completion performance evaluation with machine learning-driven benchmarks.

This framework is underpinned by collaborative digital ecosystems that unify stakeholders—engineers, auditors, and policymakers—on shared data platforms. By demonstrating LAud’s capacity to synchronize technical specifications (e.g., substation load thresholds) with financial constraints (e.g., budget allocations), our work addresses a critical gap identified by Bosu et al. (2023)41 in aligning engineering priorities with fiscal accountability. Furthermore, the study elucidates how LAud’s proactive risk identification mechanisms, leveraging AI-augmented analysis of operational logs and environmental data, mitigate the systemic vulnerabilities in power transmission systems13.

Lifecyle audit challenges in power grid projects

As power-grid projects escalate in scale and complexity, traditional auditing approaches struggle to address the multifaceted challenges of modern infrastructure development. These challenges underscore the imperative for adopting LAud frameworks that integrate continuous monitoring and predictive analytics.

Current practices disproportionately focus on post-completion financial reviews, neglecting critical front-end nodes such as design validation, procurement oversight, and contractor selection35. This fragmented approach fails to detect risks embedded in early project phases, such as design flaws or bid-rigging, which later manifest as cost overruns or operational failures13. LAud addresses this gap through real-time monitoring of all lifecycle stages, leveraging IoT-enabled progress tracking and predictive modeling to identify deviations during design and construction25. For instance, SCADA system interoperability allows auditors to validate equipment specifications against live operational data, ensuring alignment between design intent and implementation36.

Audit findings often remain siloed within departmental boundaries, lacking integration with strategic decision-making processes. This disconnection stems from inadequate digital infrastructure to disseminate insights across engineering, finance, and risk management teams26. LAud transforms audit outcomes into actionable intelligence by deploying centralized digital platforms that automate report generation and distribute findings to stakeholders in real time. Machine learning algorithms33 enable predictive risk scoring, allowing preemptive interventions in procurement or contractor performance. Furthermore, blockchain-based audit trails32, enhance transparency in corrective action tracking, addressing the feedback loop deficiencies41.

Last but not least, the exponential growth of audit scope—spanning environmental compliance, cybersecurity, and supply chain ethics—has strained traditional audit teams39. While outsourcing to intermediaries temporarily alleviates resource shortages, it introduces governance gaps, such as inconsistent data standards and misaligned incentives12. LAud mitigates these issues through digitalization-driven automation, reducing manual workloads by 40–60% in routine compliance checks40. For example, natural language processing tools audit contractual documents against regulatory databases, while computer vision systems validate construction milestones via drone-captured imagery. This shift enables internal teams to focus on high-value tasks like fraud pattern analysis and resilience stress-testing, aligning with the proactive risk culture30.

By transitioning from reactive compliance checks to a lifecycle assurance model, power-grid enterprises can reduce project risks at early stages, as evidenced by pilot implementations in state-owned utilities37,38. This evolution positions LAud not merely as an audit methodology but as a cornerstone of sustainable infrastructure governance.

This study employed a qualitative case study approach to investigate the implementation of a full-process LAud model within a state-owned organization’s internal audit framework. The research focused on managing power-grid projects and controlling risks throughout the project lifecycle, using 29 completed power-grid projects in 2023 as the primary empirical context. This case study design was selected to enable an in-depth exploration of the LAud framework’s operational dynamics and its alignment with audit needs throughout the project lifecycle.

Data collection and analysis

The primary data were collected through two methods, namely, document analysis and expert interviews. Regarding the document analysis, a purposive sample of the completed power-grid projects was selected based on their relevance to the LAud framework’s implementation. Internal audit reports, project records, and post-audit evaluations were systematically reviewed to identify patterns in governance practices, digital tool utilization, and audit outcomes42. Meanwhile, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 11 stakeholders, including internal auditors, project managers, IT specialists, and senior executives involved in the power-grid company as shown in Table 1. Interviews focused on validating the framework’s efficacy, uncovering challenges in collaborative governance, and evaluating the role of digital tools in enhancing audit transparency and efficiency.

The interviewees were selected purposively to capture audit perspectives from the 29 completed power-grid projects. Selection criteria for these interviewees were (a) direct involvement in at least one of the completed power-grid projects and (b) functional role in internal audit, project management, IT systems, or executive oversight, and with a minimum of five years’ experience. Recruitment continued until thematic saturation was reached—no new concepts emerged after the ninth interview, and two confirmatory interviews were added, yielding the final sample of 11 stakeholders.

Thematic analysis was then applied to documentary and interview data. Iterative code development focused on project lifecycle stages. Interview transcripts were triangulated with project documentation for consistency and reliability. Emerging patterns were mapped to the LAud framework’s theoretical foundations, with discrepancies resolved through research team discussions.

Case study context, LAud framework Implementation, and digital platform development

The study was conducted at State Grid Jiangsu Electric Power Company, a prominent provincial power grid company within the State Grid Corporation of China. This state-owned enterprise was deliberately chosen because such organizations are both the dominant investors in China’s power-grid infrastructure and subject to stringent public-sector auditing standards, thereby providing a high-stakes, high-visibility environment in which the benefits and constraints of a full-process LAud model can be rigorously examined and transparently validated. This company plays a crucial role in the region’s energy infrastructure, overseeing 13 municipal and 59 county-level branches, and serving a substantial customer base of over 50.77 million. In 2023, the company successfully completed 29 power-grid projects, which provided a rich empirical context for developing and testing the LAud framework.

The power-grid projects were located across different geographical areas within Jiangsu Province, including urban centers, suburban regions, and rural areas. This geographical diversity posed unique challenges in terms of environmental conditions, land acquisition, and coordination with local stakeholders. For instance, projects in urban areas had to navigate complex underground utility networks and meet higher safety and environmental standards, while rural projects faced challenges related to transportation of materials and limited local infrastructure support.

The company operates in a highly regulated and dynamic environment, with increasing demands for power supply reliability and quality. It faces intense competition in the electricity market and growing expectations from customers and regulators regarding project cost-effectiveness, environmental sustainability, and social responsibility. These factors made the power-grid projects not only technically challenging but also strategically critical for the company’s long-term development and reputation.

The successful completion of these projects was essential for enhancing the power supply capacity, improving grid stability, and supporting the economic growth of the region. However, the projects also carried significant risks, such as cost overruns, schedule delays, and quality issues, which necessitated effective governance and risk control mechanisms.

Against this backdrop, the study proposed a holistic LAud framework covering six critical stages of power-grid projects’ lifecycle after expert verification: Project Initiation, Survey and Design, Bidding, Tendering and Procurement, Implementation of Engineering Project, Engineering Completion, and Post-Completion Audit.

Throughout the pilot program, the company developed a new workflow to streamline the audit process. This workflow incorporated the principles of the LAud framework and emphasized mid-process and pre-process engagement. It involved various stages, from audit planning and implementation to reporting and follow-up, ensuring continuous tracking and on-site audits throughout the construction process.

Post-pilot, a fully functional digital LAud platform was developed to support the implementation of the LAud framework. This platform enhanced off-site data analysis for engineering audits, characterized by “full-volume scanning, precise positioning, systematic analysis, and focused verification” to accurately identify project issues. It automatically collected data across three layers: decision-making, business, and support, providing a comprehensive digital solution for auditing power-grid projects.

The current study provides an in-depth exploration of implementing the LAud framework in a state-owned power-grid enterprise. By offering detailed insights into the case study background and implementation process, the study highlights the practical application and effectiveness of the LAud framework in enhancing project governance and sustainability through continuous auditing practices and digital innovation.

Backgrounds and cases

State Grid Jiangsu Electric Power Company was selected as the power-grid enterprise in this study, which is a preeminent provincial power grid company within the State Grid Corporation of China. In 2023, they had completed 29 power-grid projects, which were used as the main source of data for developing the LAud framework. Some of the completed power-grid projects included Yangzhou Power Supply Branch Maintenance Facility Project, Zhenjiang Junbei 110 kV Substation Expansion, Nantong Haidong 110 kV Substation Expansion, Qidong Yongyang 220 kV Substation Supporting Grid Project, and so on as illustrated in Fig. 1.

In its pursuit of operational excellence and risk management, they implemented a comprehensive auditing strategy tailored to different types of projects. This strategy ensured rigorous oversight throughout the project lifecycle. Particularly, the tender control price, a critical component of project cost management, was identified as a key focus area for the process tracking management audit, with a separate and detailed audit report issued to provide transparent and actionable insights. These data served as useful information and references in clarifying the process involved in LAud.

Development of LAud framework

As a result, a holistic LAud framework is proposed that covers various critical stages of power-grid projects’ lifecycle after verifying the details with the experts in the company. Figure 2 illustrates the details of the LAud framework. The details of each stage and how they should be implemented in power-grid projects throughout the project lifecycle are as follows:

I.

Stage 1: Project Initiation.

The project initiation stage establishes the foundational framework for power grid development by addressing planning approvals, feasibility study reviews, and compliance with regulatory prerequisites. During this phase, project teams prepare and submit documentation for land use pre-approval, policy alignment, and investment plan formulation. Auditors rigorously evaluate adherence to national policies and corporate governance mandates, ensuring procedural legality, transparency in fund allocation, and alignment with strategic decisions issued by the organization’s leadership. Emphasis is placed on verifying that pre-construction conditions, such as environmental clearances and stakeholder consultations, are fully satisfied before advancing to subsequent stages.

II.

Stage 2: Survey and Design.

The survey and design phase focuses on translating conceptual plans into actionable engineering blueprints. Engineers develop preliminary designs and construction drawings, which undergo iterative reviews to optimize technical specifications, cost efficiency, and safety protocols. Auditors assess the adequacy of geological surveys, structural calculations, and risk mitigation strategies embedded within the designs, ensuring alignment with industry standards and project objectives. This stage also involves oversight of third-party design contractors to prevent deviations from approved parameters. Critical attention is directed toward identifying discrepancies between design iterations and their implications for project timelines, budgets, and operational resilience.

III.

Stage 3: Bidding, Tendering and Procurement.

During the procurement phase, project managers formulate bidding strategies, draft procurement documents, and evaluate vendor qualifications to secure cost-effective and compliant contracts. Auditors monitor the entire procurement lifecycle, from bid solicitation to contract execution, to prevent irregularities such as collusion, inflated pricing, or non-competitive practices. A key audit activity involves comparing winning bid prices with pre-established control benchmarks to detect anomalies. Additionally, auditors scrutinize the fairness of bid evaluation criteria, the accuracy of technical specifications, and the integrity of award decisions. Post-award audits ensure that contractual terms, including delivery schedules and quality guarantees, are explicitly defined and legally binding.

IV.

Stage 4: Implementation of Engineering Project.

The implementation phase prioritizes adherence to safety regulations, contractual obligations, and environmental safeguards. Auditors conduct on-site inspections to verify compliance with land acquisition protocols, migrant worker wage disbursements, and construction quality standards. They validate work volumes through physical measurements, particularly for concealed elements like underground foundations, and assess the legitimacy of design changes or cost adjustments. Contractual deviations, such as unauthorized subcontracting or unapproved scope expansions, are flagged to mitigate financial and operational risks.

Material audits ensure traceability and quality control across the supply chain. Auditors review equipment supervision logs, material distribution records, and storage practices to prevent losses or misuse. They verify tax compliance in material settlements and investigate discrepancies such as inflated procurement costs or off-book inventory. Special attention is given to the disposal of surplus or scrap materials to ensure compliance with waste management regulations.

Financial oversight focuses on budget adherence, tax accountability, and fraud prevention. Auditors reconcile expenditures against feasibility estimates, design budgets, and final settlements to detect overruns. Pre-audit mechanisms are applied to critical payments, including land compensation and contractor invoices, to block unauthorized fund diversion. Rigorous reviews of affiliated entities’ expenses, such as subcontractors or design consultants, further safeguard against fraudulent accounting practices. Ensuring compliance in settlement management and providing a sufficient basis for settlements are also critical. To maintain financial transparency and prevent misuse, pre-audit processes are implemented at various payment stages, including land compensation, construction payments, and material payments. Furthermore, extended audits are conducted on the cost expenditures of affiliated construction, design, and supervisory units. This comprehensive approach helps preventing the establishment of unauthorized funds, commonly referred to as “slush funds,” ensuring that all financial activities are legitimate and properly accounted for.

V.

Stage 5: Engineering Completion.

The completion phase involves a two-tier audit process to finalize project costs and validate deliverables. The settlement audit cross-references completed work with contractual terms through document reviews and on-site inspections, verifying labor costs, material consumption, and scope deviations. The final account audit then reconciles initial budgets with actual expenditures, ensuring adherence to approved scales and timelines. Auditors confirm asset registrations and financial closures, formally certifying the project’s readiness for operational handover.

VI.

Stage 6: Post Completion Audit.

The post-completion audit evaluates the project’s long-term viability and societal impact. Auditors analyze economic returns, environmental sustainability, and grid reliability to identify inefficiencies in planning or execution. Recommendations are formulated to enhance future investment decisions, optimize asset utilization, and align projects with regional development goals. This retrospective assessment ensures accountability, fosters continuous improvement, and strengthens the alignment of power grid investments with national energy strategies.

Testing of LAud framework and proposal of additional workflow

After acceptance of the Laud framework by the power-grid company, a pilot program was initiated to implement full-process auditing using the principles in the LAud framework. This initiative expanded audit supervision to cover the entire project lifecycle, from the initial stages of planning, scheduling, and procurement, through construction, completion, and eventual operation. By adopting an interventionist approach that emphasized mid-process and pre-process engagement, the company carried out ongoing tracking and on-site audits throughout the construction process. As a result, a new workflow was developed to further streamline the audit process. The workflow is illustrated in Fig. 3.

During the project initiation phase, the company’s audit department developed an audit work plan based on the annual audit project schedule. In the audit implementation phase, the audit department formed an audit team as required and issued an audit notice to the audited enterprise, which acknowledged receipt. The audit team then prepared an audit implementation plan, conducting pre-audit surveys when necessary to define the audit scope and focus. On-site audits began with an opening meeting, during which the audited enterprise was expected to provide full cooperation. The audit team conducted the on-site audit, generating audit records and working papers, while the audited enterprise supplied the necessary documents and confirmed the accuracy of the working papers. The audit team also conducted interviews as needed, and the audit department provided project guidance when required.

In the audit report phase, the audit team drafted interim audit reports based on the findings from the on-site audit, and the audited enterprise implemented corrective actions accordingly. After project completion, the audit team prepared the engineering tracking audit report, incorporating insights from both on-site and interim reports and seeking input from relevant departments. Management recommendations were provided based on identified issues, and the audit department reviewed the report before finalizing it. The final audit report was then shared with the audited enterprise for feedback before being officially delivered.

In the post-report phase, the audited unit was responsible for implementing the recommended audit corrections and submitting a detailed feedback report to the audit department. Upon receiving the feedback, the audit department archived all audit project materials in accordance with established requirements, thereby concluding the audit process.

Overall, the new workflow had streamlined the auditing process and strengthened risk mitigation strategies, ensuring that projects were completed successfully and in compliance with established standards and regulations. It also facilitated the timely identification and rectification of issues, significantly enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of project management.

Digital platform of LAud

After successful completion of the pilot program, a full-functional digital platform of LAud was developed to realize all required processes in the practice. It would increase the depth and breadth of off-site data analysis for engineering audit, delving deeper into the value of data. This platform serves as a comprehensive digital audit approach characterized by “full-volume scanning, precise positioning, systematic analysis, and focused verification” to accurately identify issues within engineering projects. It allowed for a comprehensive understanding of the trends in problem risks, providing a basis for targeted tasks in engineering audit. It could automatically collect the necessary data based on three main layers, namely, decision-making layer, business layer and support layer.

The digital platform of LAud is built on a robust technical architecture that ensures seamless integration with existing enterprise systems. It incorporates advanced integration mechanisms to connect with systems such as ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) and BIM (Building Information Modeling), enabling smooth data exchange and collaboration. The platform employs standardized interfaces and data protocols to ensure compatibility and efficient data flow between systems. This integration allows for real-time data sharing, eliminating information silos and enhancing the overall efficiency of project management and auditing processes.

In terms of cybersecurity, the platform implements multiple layers of security measures to protect sensitive project and financial data. These include encryption of data in transit and at rest, strict access controls based on user roles and permissions, and continuous monitoring for potential threats. The platform also undergoes regular security audits and vulnerability assessments to ensure its resilience against evolving cyber threats.

The technical roadmap of the digital platform of LAud is shown in Fig. 4.

Decision-making layer

The decision making level played a pivotal role in offering high - level guidance and devising strategic plans for audit work in the digital platform. The project analysis module conducted an in - depth examination of various aspects of engineering projects. Cost - benefit analysis was performed to evaluate whether the benefits justified the costs. Schedule control was implemented to ensure projects were completed in a timely manner. Risk assessment was carried out to identify potential threats and develop mitigation strategies. The accountability analysis module functioned to ensure clear assignment of responsibility during the audit process. It accurately identified any violations, enhancing transparency and accountability. The issue analysis module was dedicated to pinpointing and analyzing potential problems within engineering projects, allowing for early detection and mitigation of issues. The talent analysis module assessed the capabilities of the audit team. It ensured that audit tasks were executed by individuals with the right skills and knowledge, sometimes even prompting the organization to tailor training programs and professional development initiatives to enhance the skills of the staff.

Business layer

The business layer constituted the central component of the digital audit platform, directly facilitating the execution of audit workflows. For example, the project management module structured the audit lifecycle by encompassing initiation, planning, execution, and monitoring phases. It ensured adherence to predefined objectives and standards through embedded governance frameworks, enabling systematic progress tracking and resource allocation. The rectification management module prioritized issue resolution through a structured feedback loop. Identified discrepancies were logged, tracked, and validated against corrective actions, ensuring accountability and timely remediation. Collectively, these modules synergized to enhance audit efficiency, compliance, and transparency. The business layer’s architecture not only digitized manual processes but also embedded continuous improvement mechanisms, positioning the platform as a scalable solution for evolving audit demands.

Support layer

In the completed platform, the support layer played a crucial in role providing essential backing and resources for the audit work.

The audit knowledge base functioned as a repository. It contained policy regulations, issue classification libraries, and standard working paper templates, serving as a reference and guidance source for auditors. The outcomes repository was utilized to store audit records, issue databases, and international reference materials, supplying historical data and case analyses for future audits. The data resource library, which included a data resource catalog, data quality management, data application scenarios, and data access management, ensured the accuracy and security of audit data.

Within the support and assurance module, the audit knowledge base was divided into a standards library and an outcomes library. The standards library was composed of policy and regulation databases, issue classification libraries, standard working paper templates, template libraries, audit task libraries, standard record templates, audit matter libraries, audit system guidance libraries, rectification standard libraries, regulatory penalty libraries, and rectification standard libraries. The outcomes library consisted of audit case libraries, project material libraries, working paper libraries, audit record libraries, issue libraries, entity material libraries, audit label libraries, audit training libraries, and international reference libraries. It is worth noting that the audit training library had been planned to be launched in the third phase of the platform.

In summary, the digital audit platform had been designed with a multi - role workstation approach, empowered stakeholders to access particular functions and information in line with their needs. This not only enhanced the efficiency and quality of the audit work but also, through in - depth data analysis and mining, lent strong support and assurance to engineering project management. Figure 5 illustrates the main interface of the digital platform of LAud.

Challenges and achievements of the LAud framework

The case study on implementing the LAud framework at State Grid Jiangsu Electric Power Company faced several challenges. The power-grid projects’ complexity, varying in scale and technical requirements, demanded auditors to possess extensive technical and managerial knowledge. For instance, substation expansion required coordinating multiple technical systems, while smart grid implementation needed advanced technology integration. Additionally, data integration from diverse sources like project management software and financial systems was hindered by inconsistency and incompatibility, necessitating unified data standards. Resistance to change from staff accustomed to traditional auditing also posed a challenge, requiring extensive communication and training. Ensuring the digital platform’s security and stability was another critical concern, demanding significant investment in cybersecurity measures.

However, the LAud framework also brings remarkable achievements. In 2023, State Grid Jiangsu Electric Power Company audited 111,400 engineering projects, covering a total investment of 78.047 billion yuan, and achieved cost savings and revenue increments of 2.902 billion yuan through measures such as reducing engineering costs. The full-process auditing work not only enhanced the efficiency and quality of audits but also significantly improved the management level of engineering projects and the efficiency of fund utilization. Furthermore, the LAud framework played a crucial role in these achievements by providing comprehensive oversight throughout the project lifecycle, enabling early issue identification and risk reduction. The digital platform significantly improved audit efficiency through automated data analysis and report generation, allowing for more accurate and timely project issue identification. The framework strengthened risk control by enabling proactive risk monitoring and mitigation strategies across all project stages, minimizing potential losses. It also supported the company’s sustainability goals by ensuring environmental compliance and efficient resource utilization. The post-completion audit offered insights into projects’ long-term viability and societal impact, guiding future investment decisions. Furthermore, the digital platform marked a significant step in the company’s digital transformation, demonstrating how technology can enhance traditional auditing practices. Finally, the framework fostered better collaboration among stakeholders, improving communication and coordination among various roles within the company.

Theoretical contributions

This research has made significant strides in exploring the application of LAud in power-grid projects. Through a qualitative case study approach, we examined the implementation of a full-process LAud model within a state-owned organization’s internal audit framework. The study analyzed data from 29 completed power-grid projects and incorporated expert interviews to validate the framework and investigate collaborative governance mechanisms and digital empowerment strategies. The core outcome is the development of a comprehensive LAud framework that covers all critical stages of power-grid projects’ lifecycle, from initiation to post-completion audit. This framework has been tested and refined through a pilot program, leading to the creation of a new workflow and a fully functional digital platform for LAud. The results demonstrate that LAud can enhance project governance and sustainability by enabling real-time monitoring, proactive risk mitigation, and continuous data integration, thereby addressing the limitations of traditional auditing methods.

The study advances theoretical discourse by redefining lifecycle auditing as a dynamic, technology-driven governance mechanism rather than a static compliance tool. Traditional auditing frameworks, as critiqued, often prioritize periodic financial reviews, neglecting operational risks embedded in early project phases23. By contrast, this research operationalizes LAud as a holistic system that embeds real-time assurance across design, procurement, construction, and operational stages—a paradigm shift aligning the call for resilience-oriented auditing in critical infrastructure32. The integration of SCADA systems and IoT sensors for compliance tracking extends foundational work on continuous auditing25, bridging the gap between financial reporting and engineering integrity. Furthermore, the framework’s emphasis on predictive analytics for risk forecasting (e.g., design-phase anomalies) responds to advocacy for AI-enhanced evaluation methods in power projects14. This contribution repositions LAud as a cornerstone of sustainable infrastructure governance, harmonizing technical specifications with fiscal accountability.

The second theoretical contribution lies in elucidating the role of collaborative digital ecosystems in overcoming siloed audit practices. Prior studies, such as those by Zhou et al.35, identified fragmented oversight as a key barrier to infrastructure risk management. This research demonstrates how LAud’s digital platform fosters interdisciplinary collaboration among engineers, auditors, and policymakers through shared data interfaces and automated reporting. By aligning real-time audit findings with strategic decision-making, the framework operationalizes the “collaborative assurance” concept proposed by Wahdan et al.31, which emphasizes cross-functional transparency. These findings extend holistic audit model36 by embedding stakeholder synergy into lifecycle governance, thereby addressing the feedback loop deficiencies.

The third theoretical contribution is the exploration of the digital empowerment mechanisms within the LAud framework. This research highlights the critical role of technology in enhancing audit efficiency and effectiveness. The developed digital platform for LAud incorporates advanced technologies such as IoT sensors, SCADA systems, and machine learning algorithms. These technologies enable high-frequency audit cycles aligned with project milestones, automated monitoring of technical, financial, and operational parameters, and exception-based auditing supplemented by human expertise for complex judgments25. The platform also supports continuous data modeling using inputs from various sources, providing real-time assurance over both financial and non-financial performance indicators. This technological integration addresses the limitations of traditional auditing methods, which often struggle with the dynamic and complex nature of power-grid projects23,43. The digital empowerment mechanisms developed in this study provide a theoretical foundation for how technology can transform audit practices in critical infrastructure sectors.

Practical implementations

The implementation of the LAud framework can lead to improved project governance and sustainability by enabling proactive risk identification and immediate corrective actions throughout the project lifecycle. For project managers and auditors, the framework provides a structured approach to tracking progress against planned schedules, budgets, and quality benchmarks, facilitating better decision-making. The digital platform developed in this study offers a scalable solution for continuous auditing and enhances the accuracy and timeliness of audit reports. This can result in significant cost savings and improved project outcomes. Additionally, the collaborative governance mechanisms within the LAud framework promote transparency and accountability among stakeholders, fostering a culture of continuous improvement and alignment with organizational goals.

The LAud framework has enormous potential for widespread application. It can be adapted for use in other types of organizations and industries, though some modifications may be necessary. State-owned enterprises typically prioritize regulatory compliance, public accountability, and long-term societal impacts, aligning with centralized governance structures. In contrast, private enterprises often emphasize cost efficiency, shareholder returns, and agile decision-making, necessitating streamlined audit workflows and faster return-on-investment justification. For example, private enterprises may need to adjust the framework to suit their unique governance models and operational dynamics. Future development of LAud should consider the different needs in private enterprises, while retaining its core principles of real-time monitoring and proactive risk management during its implementation.

The implementation of the LAud framework may encounter several obstacles, such as high costs, training demands, and organizational resistance to innovation. Organizations might be reluctant to invest in new technologies and training programs due to budget constraints. Additionally, integrating the LAud digital platform with existing systems like ERP and BIM can be complex. To address these issues, organizations should conduct thorough cost-benefit analyses to demonstrate the long-term advantages of adopting LAud. Developing comprehensive training programs and effective change management strategies can help overcome resistance and ensure a smooth implementation process.

When compared to other contemporary audit models, the LAud framework offers several advantages. Traditional audit models typically focus on periodic financial reviews, often overlooking operational risks across project phases. In contrast, this framework provides continuous, real-time monitoring across all project stages, from design to operation. This holistic approach enables early risk detection and timely corrective actions. While other models may offer valuable insights, LAud uniquely combines technical, financial, and operational data using advanced technologies like IoT sensors and machine learning algorithms, providing a more comprehensive view of project performance. The framework’s emphasis on proactive risk mitigation and continuous improvement further distinguishes it from models that primarily rely on post-hoc analysis. These features make the LAud framework a superior choice for auditing complex infrastructure projects.",https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-025-20389-9/MediaObjects/41598_2025_20389_Fig1_HTML.png,N,,2025-10-17 17:07:47.615205

Energy Northwest, a Washington State-based joint action agency, unveiled the official name and new images of its proposed SMR facility in Washington state, marking a milestone one year after announcing its partnership with X-energy and Amazon.

The proposed project – now officially called Cascade Advanced Energy Facility – is poised to be the first SMR in the Pacific Northwest.

“Today marks a pivotal step forward in bringing this transformative project to life,” said Bob Schuetz, CEO of Energy Northwest. “We are proud to be at the forefront of deploying advanced nuclear technology in the region -- driving next-generation solutions that strengthen energy security and position the Pacific Northwest as a clean energy leader.”

Since the 2024 announcement, Energy Northwest has focused on engagement with stakeholders and Tribal Nations, conducting environmental reviews, safety evaluations, permitting, licensing and risk analyses to prepare for a construction permit application to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

These ongoing activities are laying the groundwork for delivering reliable, around-the-clock, carbon-free energy to meet the region’s rising energy demands, Energy Northwest said.

Energy Northwest has also selected AtkinsRéalis as the project’s technical advisor, drawing on the company’s extensive technical and operational expertise.

Additionally, Energy Northwest has acquired an Energy Learning Center in collaboration with Columbia Basin College and with funding from the DOE’s Community Capacity Building Grant Program.

The Energy Learning Center, which will be located at Washington State University’s Institute for Northwest Energy Futures campus and will include a simulator that replicates X-energy's control room.

This education simulator, which will be operational later this year, will give students hands-on experience with the technology that will power X-energy's Xe-100 reactors.

Energy Northwest’s Cascade Advanced Energy Facility is projected to generate 320 megawatts of energy, and when fully built out, up to 960 MW.

It is also expected to create more than 1,000 temporary construction jobs during construction and over 100 permanent family-wage positions once operational, spanning nuclear operations, engineering and other specialized fields.

The project’s timeline is expected to follow X-energy and Dow’s first-of-a-kind deployment of the same reactor technology for the Long Mott Generating Station project in Seadrift, Texas, part of the U.S. Department of Energy’s Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program.",https://www.publicpower.org/themes/custom/appa_foundation/favicon.ico,N,,2025-10-17 20:08:44.459792

We just wrapped up the IUCN World Conservation Congress in Abu Dhabi, after a packed, inspirational and exhausting seven days, working with passionate and knowledgeable advocates for nature from across the globe, within and beyond the BirdLife Partnership.

Dr Lesley Dickie, Executive Vice President for Conservation and the Regions at BirdLife International, said:

“Bringing thousands of conservationists together, the IUCN World Conservation Congress has stimulated vital debate about how we shape our world. It is an ever more important imperative that open dialogue takes place when the stakes are so high. The IUCN Congress gives space for the conversations we must have to save our precious nature. Now, we get back to action.”

The Congress in numbers:

Over 10,000 participants with representation from more than 45 BirdLife Partners (totalling over 80 BirdLife Partnership delegates)

147 resolutions adopted (and 17 motions co-sponsored by BirdLife Partnership)

1,360 bird species reassessed as part of the IUCN Red List Update

100+ new IUCN Members welcomed, including six new State Members

100+ Indigenous Leaders gathered for landmark World Summit

New IUCN leadership (2026-2029) elected with various BirdLife Partners and supporters on board

A unique forum happening only every four years, the Congress is a big deal for the future of our planet. The world’s largest and most influential gathering on nature, it brought together around 10,000 participants from governments, civil society, Indigenous Peoples’ organisations, donors, academia and business. Together we raised the alarm on pressing threats to nature, highlighted solutions and innovations, and set the agenda for policy and action on the ground, endorsing a new 20-year vision for the Union.

The BirdLife Partnership – the world’s oldest and largest global partnership for nature, with 123 national NGO Partners around the world – was there in force, with more than 80 staff from over 45 IUCN Member/BirdLife Partners joining forces for nature. This is always the biggest BirdLife delegation we see in any global meeting, which allows us to catch up with each other as a Partnership and to learn from what is working in different parts of the world.

Taking stock halfway to 2030

This Congress came at a key juncture, midway to 2030. It was a moment to take stock of progress toward the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework, the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration, the Paris Agreement on Climate, and the Sustainable Development Goals. The ongoing geopolitics and financial climate continue to challenge the current operating environment. However, an emergency motion reaffirming the importance of IUCN’s role in multilateralism and international cooperation highlighted the need for us to work together. It called on us to underscore the importance of nature as the foundation of economies and societies, and to make clear the links to climate ahead of the COP30 climate talks in Brazil next month.

The power of many: scale and collaboration

We at BirdLife went into the Congress having launched an incredibly exciting new partnership with the World Bank, working with a strategic network of more than 50 of our Partners to scale up implementation and innovative finance for nature across the Africa-Eurasia flyway. It’s exactly this idea of scale and collaboration, which is at the heart of IUCN, BirdLife and our wider partnerships, that are needed to deliver action and finance at the necessary scale and pace to reverse the loss of biodiversity by 2030.

The BirdLife Partnership was involved in events across the Forum, which took place on the first days of the Congress, and co-sponsored 17 motions. These were discussed in groups and then voted on in the Members’ Assembly over the final three days.

Highlighting issues and showcasing solutions

Many motions and events highlighted key issues and solutions relating to species, sites, systems and society and covering science, partnership, advocacy, and implementation. With the latest update of the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species revealing increasing declines in birds and other taxa, we highlighted how citizen science, such as birding, can help us understand the status and trends of birds and biodiversity to inform policy and action.

Like BirdLife, IUCN continues to champion species and the importance of species data, which underpins some of the critical knowledge products (including the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species and Key Biodiversity Areas) and tools (such as IBAT – the Integrated Biodiversity Assessment Tool, AVISTEP – the Avian Sensitivity for Energy Planning, and TESSA – the Toolkit for Ecosystem Service Site-Based Assessment), that help guide conservation and development to ensure optimal and efficient outcomes for nature, climate and people.

Throughout the Congress, we highlighted some of the big initiatives that apply this knowledge and experience together with on-ground expertise through our Partners. We shared insights about our regional flyways initiatives and the Conserva Aves initiative focused on identifying, designating and effectively managing locally-led protected and conserved areas across 11 countries in the Americas. We also talked about our Forest Impact Accelerator initiative, which has just received funding from the UK government to establish sustainable finance initiatives in priority tropical forest landscapes to help secure 1 million hectares of Key Biodiversity Areas alongside economic benefits for 200,000 local people.

We held a side-meeting of the Convention on Migratory Species Energy Task Force, which we coordinate, where we discussed and showcased ways to achieve a just renewable energy transition that contributes to both net zero and nature positive global goals. And we discussed how our new Nature Action Tracker can hold governments to account, understand what works and incentivise efforts, and shared our new guidance on just and effective engagement in landscape restoration.

The business-end of the Congress

One of the most important outcomes of the Congress is the discussion and agreement of motions, which, if passed, become resolutions or recommendations and guide the work and advocacy of the Union over the coming quadrennium. IUCN members passed 147 motions in total, 97 through an electronic vote last month, and the remainder following discussions in small ‘contact groups’ and when necessary, in plenary before being taken to the vote. While emotions ran high on some, with varying opinions reflecting the diversity of IUCN, the tone remained civil and constructive, enabling compromise to be reached in nearly every case.

Successful motions covered a wide range of issues. We proposed one which passed through the e-vote on ensuring companies disclose and take action to minimise negative impacts on biodiversity in ways that will achieve the goals of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (KMGBF). This highlights the importance of global biodiversity data, such as the IUCN Red List and Key Biodiversity Areas, in helping to guide both development and conservation. It also links to other motions on the need for businesses, sectors such as renewable energy and mechanisms such as biodiversity credits to contribute to the nature positive global goal, which is aligned with the KMGBF mission of halting and reversing the loss of biodiversity by 2030.

Christine Dragisic, Managing Director of Global Policy at Audubon Society (one of our BirdLife Partners in the US) added: “The IUCN World Conservation Congress 2025 was a powerful reminder of what’s possible when we work together for nature. It was inspiring for Audubon to stand alongside our BirdLife partners to showcase innovative conservation and advance resolutions that will benefit birds, people, and the planet across the Americas and beyond.”

Several motions debated and voted on at the Congress focused on area-based conservation. They called for stronger protections against unsustainable tourism, such as the proposal from PPNEA, our Partner in Albania. Other motions addressed the protection of seamounts, the integrity of mesopelagic ecosystems in the oceans, and forest integrity in the Congo Basin. Together, these efforts highlighted the need to deliver both the qualitative and quantitative aspects of the ‘30×30’ target of the KMGBF — to effectively and equitably protect and conserve at least 30% of terrestrial, inland water, coastal, and marine areas by 2030. This includes key areas for biodiversity and ecosystem services, while also beginning to look ahead to more ambitious targets beyond 2030.

There were also several motions relating to the rights of nature, as well as one calling for recognition of the crime of ecocide – interesting developments which would provide additional legal channels to protect nature.

Finally, key motions supporting the non-proliferation of fossil fuels (and an urgent, just, nature-positive renewable energy transition), the need to address plastic pollution following the collapse of negotiations to agree a plastics treaty, and the endorsement of an IUCN policy on synthetic biology provide a strong legacy of this Congress.

Joseph Onoja, Director General of the Nigerian Conservation Foundation, said:

“From over 40 countries, one flock, one purpose. At the IUCN World Conservation Congress, BirdLife Partners stood united — speaking for nature, people, and the planet we all share.

It was, as always, a great pleasure to join the BirdLife flock at the IUCN World Conservation Congress. We demonstrated remarkable camaraderie, working with clear purpose and unity. Together, we supported motions that not only strengthen the work of IUCN but also advance our shared mission to conserve nature and improve the wellbeing of people.”

Dive Brief:

A coalition of 22 states and the District of Columbia on Wednesday sued the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin for ending the $7 billion Solar for All Program.

Separately, a coalition of 24 Solar for All grant recipients on Tuesday filed a breach-of-contract complaint in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims to recover damages for the EPA’s termination of Solar for All grants.

The states’ legal actions follow similar lawsuits filed Monday by Harris County, Texas, and last week by solar companies and community and labor groups arguing that the EPA’s termination of the Solar for All program strips local governments of critical clean energy funding

Dive Insight:

The lawsuit, filed by 22 states in U.S. District Court in the Western District of Washington, alleges the EPA has “unilaterally and illegally terminated a multi-billion-dollar program designed to bring low-cost distributed solar energy to over 900,000 households in low-income and disadvantaged communities.”

The EPA abruptly ended the Solar for All program, created under the Clean Air Act’s Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund to help low-income communities adopt clean energy, as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act in July, the plaintiffs said in the court filing.

Because all $7 billion in Solar for All grants had already been obligated by August 2024 — before the OBBBA became law — the plaintiffs contend the EPA acted illegally by terminating the program and blocking access to their awarded funds, the states contend.

“Plaintiffs relied upon the SFA Program to meet benchmarks for clean energy production, to create jobs, to limit environmental damage caused by pollutants, and to generate energy cost savings for households, including in low-income and disadvantaged communities,” the lawsuit states.

The attorneys general of Arizona, Minnesota and Washington are leading the complaint, which was joined by the attorneys general of California, Colorado, Connecticut, the District of Columbia, Hawaiʻi, Illinois, Massachusetts, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island and Vermont. The governors of Kentucky and Pennsylvania, as well as the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation, also joined the complaint.

Connecticut Attorney General William Tong said in a statement that the EPA awarded the funds, which were created by Congress, so Connecticut could help low-income residents save millions of dollars on their energy bills. “Trump cannot unilaterally reverse course now, and we’re suing to make sure Connecticut gets every penny we are owed,” he said.

Connecticut was awarded $62.5 million last year in Solar for All funding to increase access to solar and energy storage for low-income communities, including multifamily affordable housing.

″As public servants, it is incumbent upon us to fight for fairness and justice, and that is what this lawsuit sets out to do,” California Energy Commission Chair David Hochschild said in a statement. “The state’s goal to advance a 100% clean energy future depends on programs like this that make solar and storage affordable for all.”

The EPA is terminating nearly $250 million in funds awarded to California, including $200 million to build community solar systems, primarily for lower- and middle-income families, and $9 million for workforce training.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/Sd5zkBpjElCjYc0OBkXEjiIm7ZfqDj1RA2oLgDR_LFs/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0yMTUwMTg0NzUzLmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-10-17 13:11:43.216295

The failed sales mark a setback in President Donald Trump's push to revive a coal mining industry that's been in decline for almost two decades.

The Interior Department rejected the sole bid it received for two tracts of federal coal reserves on the Manti-La Sal National Forest near central Utah's Skyline Mine because it did not meet the requirements of the Mineral Leasing Act, agency spokesperson Alyse Sharpe said.

The leasing act requires companies to pay fair market value for coal mined on public lands. Sharpe declined to say how much was bid.

The coal tracts were requested by a subsidiary of Utah mining company Wolverine Fuels LLC, which operates the Skyline Mine and other coal mines in central Utah.

Could mining boom days return to small Utah towns?

Officials had offered a lease on one tract, with 1.3 million tons of coal, during an Oct. 1 competitive sale. The other tract, with 5 million tons of coal, was a modification to an existing lease. The rejected bid covered both tracts, Sharpe said.

Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said two weeks ago that the government will open 13 million acres of federal lands for coal mining. But it's unclear who would want that fuel as utilities turn to cheaper natural gas and renewables such as wind and solar to generate electricity.

Emissions from burning coal are a leading driver of climate change that's raising sea levels and making weather more extreme.

On Oct. 6, a coal sale from public lands in Montana that would have been the largest by the government in more than a decade drew a single bid of $186,000, or about one-tenth of a penny per ton of coal, and was later rejected. That lease held 167 million tons of coal in southeastern Montana near the Navajo Transition Energy Co.'s Spring Creek mine.

Two days later the Interior Department postponed an even bigger sale — 440 million tons next to the Navajo Nation-owned company's Antelope Mine in Wyoming.

Sharpe repeated the Republican Trump administration's assertion that the policies of former Presidents Joe Biden and Barack Obama were to blame for the failed sales, saying the Democrats tried ""to dismantle domestic production and shake investor confidence in the industry.""

Both Democrats attempted to curb sales of coal from public lands, only to have those policies reversed by Trump.

Three other coal lease sales from public lands under Trump were successful. The largest, in Alabama, involved 54 million tons of coal used in steelmaking that sold last month for $46 million, or about 87 cents per ton. Two recent sales in North Dakota of leases containing a combined 30 million tons of coal brought in $186,000 total, or less than a penny per ton.

""As demand for reliable, dispatchable power grows, coal remains a critical component of ensuring affordable and dependable energy for the American people,"" Sharpe said in a statement.

But industry analysts and economists say the biggest driver of coal's retreat has been market forces that make other fuels more economical. Many power plants served by large mines on public lands in the West are nearing retirement.

Environmentalists have fought for years against the expansion of Utah's Skyline Mine. Emma Yip with the Center for Biological Diversity described the bid rejection as ""yet another face-plant for the Trump administration"" as it tries to prop up a dying industry.

To the Editor:

During my 35-year career in environmental advocacy, I’ve opposed the privatization of natural resources numerous times. Clean air, land, and water are essential natural resources that must be managed in trust for everyone, and I have always believed strongly in public management.

When it comes to the ballot question regarding whether or not Hopewell Borough should sell its water system to New Jersey American Water, however, I will be voting yes.

I’m grateful to live in a town where residents—and our elected officials—take such decisions seriously. The large crowd that turned out to hear a presentation from opponents of the sale is evidence that participatory democracy is alive and well in Hopewell. I appreciate the diligence, commitment, and sincerity of the opponents.

I am also sympathetic to some of the arguments against the sale. The idea of local control of resources resonates with me.

But there is nothing more essential to the health of our families than the delivery of clean, safe, and healthy water. Let’s be honest with ourselves. Our beloved town is simply not up to this job. We can appreciate the staff who manage our water system. But the system is suffering from decades of deferred maintenance, and we’ve been hit with several violations from the NJ Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP).

In May, Hopewell residents received a mailing informing us that for 274 days in 2024, managers of our system failed to adequately treat our water with an additive that is used to prevent lead and other metals from leaching into our drinking water.

Change is scary. But so is lead and the forever chemical PFAS that persist in our water system.

New Jersey American Water (NJAW) is already delivering water to Hopewell to supplement our municipal well and that water meets the state of New Jersey’s standards for PFAS compounds. Moreover, the company is committed to meeting the US Environmental Protection Agency’s more stringent standards set under the Biden Administration, despite action by the Trump Administration to postpone the deadline for water systems to meet this stricter standard. According to NJAW “The recently announced plan by the EPA to extend the timeline for compliance would not impact New Jersey American Water’s PFAS compliance or capital plan as the company is committed to complying with the standards in a timely manner.”

Regarding removal of lead from Hopewell’s water system, assuming that the town votes in favor of the referendum, NJAW “intends to complete all replacements within 18-24 months (dependent on resident cooperation), ahead of the NJDEP 2031 deadline.”

Some have suggested that if Hopewell’s water infrastructure is sold to NJAW we would be left to the mercy of the company without any protection for the public interest. This is false.

New Jersey is fortunate to have several public agencies, in addition to NJDEP, that work to protect public health and the public interest.

The New Jersey Water Supply Authority (NJWSA) is charged with preserving both the quantity and quality of the source water that is refined and delivered to the state’s residents by private and public water companies. NJWSA manages the Spruce Run and Round Valley reservoirs on the Raritan River as well as the D&R Canal, another important source of drinking water.

NJWSA works in partnership with NJAW and other private and public water providers, NJDEP, nonprofit organizations like The Watershed Institute, academic institutions, and others to protect watersheds and surface waters through planning and preservation programs.

A second public body, the NJ Board of Public Utilities (BPU), is charged with regulating utilities like NJAW to provide safe, reliable, and reasonably priced services to the public.

In addition, the New Jersey Ratepayer Advocate serves as a watchdog to protect consumers from unfair pricing practices. These agencies and programs are certainly not perfect, but they exist to protect the public interest.

Hopewell residents need to decide for themselves how to vote on the Hopewell water referendum. I’ve decided to vote yes, and I hope that you will join me. The status quo is not acceptable.

Sincerely,

Jim Waltman

The investments aim to span multiple projects under U.S. oversight, foster transatlantic cooperation that enhances energy security, and focus on creating a robust and resilient fuel ecosystem. Specific projects and investment amounts will be detailed in forthcoming definitive agreements.

The partnership strengthens all parties' abilities to supply the growing global demand for energy. This effort includes co-investment into, and co-location of, fuel fabrication facilities and could include repurposing surplus plutonium in a manner consistent with established U.S. safety and security requirements.

“Fissioning surplus plutonium is the best way to eliminate a legacy liability while creating an abundant near-term fuel source. It can accelerate the deployment of multiple gigawatts of advanced reactors and serve as a bridge fuel until uranium enrichment and recycling scale up,” said Jacob DeWitte, co-founder and CEO of Oklo.

“This strategic partnership proves that energy independence relies on advanced fuels and promotes an integrated closed-loop fuel cycle. newcleo and its partners are ready to add value to the transatlantic cooperation in providing clean, safe and secure energy. The agreement proves that the U.S. and Europe can lead in this sector,” said Stefano Buono, founder and CEO of newcleo.

By channeling large-scale transatlantic investments into the American advanced nuclear industry, the partnership exemplifies newcleo’s and Blykalla’s interest in the U.S. market and supports the domestic expansion of Oklo’s fuel and fast-reactor technologies. Partnerships like this show how allied collaboration can strengthen energy innovation, leadership, and dominance in the United States.

“This agreement to implement newcleo's advanced fuel expertise into Oklo's powerhouses and invest $2 billion into American infrastructure and advanced fuel solutions is yet another win for President Donald J. Trump's American Energy Dominance Agenda,” said Secretary of the Interior and Chairman of the National Energy Dominance Council Doug Burgum. “This administration is committed to enhancing energy security, creating more American jobs, and ensuring that the United States remains at the forefront of global energy production and innovation, and I'm honored to support today's announcement to advance these goals.”

The partnership aligns private capital with federal priorities to accelerate advanced nuclear deployment while bolstering U.S. energy security and transatlantic cooperation and strengthening the domestic fuel supply.

The image, reposted from X, shows an EV charging station missing its cords, with one commenter quipping, ""I didn't realize that EV wireless charging was a thing now.""

The original Reddit poster asked a question many have been wondering: ""What's the solution? Anti-cutting cable wrap? Cameras to passively capture after the theft?""

Below the post, drivers debated whether this kind of damage counts as vandalism or theft — and what can realistically be done about it.

""Is it vandalism, or theft?"" one user asked, suggesting that some thieves might be targeting cables for copper. ""There are ones on light poles, way above the ground that spool.""

Others countered that even switching to aluminum wiring isn't a fix. ""That... won't solve the problem,"" one commenter said. ""Thieves don't steal copper — they steal things that they think are copper. Even if they abandon it because it's aluminum, it's still cut.""

These incidents aren't isolated. While this post is from three years ago, similar reports continue to surface from Los Angeles to Atlanta, with stations temporarily disabled for weeks while parts are replaced. Beyond inconvenience, the trend highlights a larger barrier to electric vehicle adoption: reliability. When chargers are damaged or out of service, drivers lose trust in the public charging network, which is a critical piece of infrastructure needed to transition away from dirty energy.

Electric vehicles remain one of the cleanest transportation options available, even factoring in battery manufacturing and charging emissions. Mining for battery minerals carries an environmental cost, but it replaces the far greater toll of extracting billions of tons of coal, oil, and gas each year.

For those charging at home, pairing an EV with solar panels can cut both costs and emissions even further. Drivers who install solar panels can effectively power their cars with sunlight, and companies like EnergySage make it easy to compare local quotes and find reliable installers vetted by The Cool Down.

While no single fix exists yet, experts say that protecting public chargers and the trust they represent is vital to keeping EV progress on track toward a cleaner, more sustainable future.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/cut-charging-cablesimage-recqjJTSPDfBkHNYP-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-17 20:07:30.008715

In North Carolina, state regulators are trying to figure out how to meet this unprecedented demand while also protecting the average ratepayer. Earlier this week, the North Carolina Utilities Commission held a two-day 'large load technical conference' to talk about these issues.

This conversation has been edited lightly for clarity.

Let’s start by introducing the players here. Who or what is the North Carolina Utilities Commission? Who was at the meeting this week?

The utilities commission is a five-person regulatory agency. They regulate public utilities in North Carolina, the largest being Duke Energy, which provides energy to the vast majority of the state.

The meeting held this week was focused on how to best serve large load customers like data centers. Several different stakeholders presented their ideas to the commission, including Duke Energy, Dominion Energy, clean energy advocates, and representatives from the data center industry.

In this context, what is the term 'large load'?

A large load customer is a customer that requires a lot of energy. According to a congressional report, data centers across the U.S. in 2023 used about 176 terawatt hours of energy, or about 4.4% of the country’s total electricity consumption that year. Some projections show the energy consumption from data centers could double or triple by 2028.

And why is that? Data centers have been around for years already. Why are they going to need so much more energy now?

Because of the rise of AI. At the meeting this week, I heard over and over again that right now, we're at an inflection point. How we choose to respond to this situation is going to have ramifications on energy production, infrastructure, and on the climate for decades to come.

What else did you hear at this week’s meeting? What are some of your biggest takeaways?

It seems that right now in North Carolina, there are a lot more questions than answers. Some of the biggest questions are: How much more energy are we going to need? By when do we need it? How are we going to generate that energy, and who’s going to pay for it?

Something else that stood out to me is that there are a lot of different balancing acts going on. Political leaders and Duke Energy representatives say data centers want to come to North Carolina because we have such a business friendly climate. These are million, and in some cases, billion dollar investments that provide good paying jobs for local families.

But that economic opportunity has to be balanced with consumer protections. The utilities commission wants to make sure the average person isn’t paying for additional energy infrastructure that’s ultimately meant to support data centers.

This is often what we hear when utilities have to generate more electricity. They talk about raising rates on ratepayers. Did this meeting provide any clarification on whether ratepayers will be paying more?

I think it’s fair to assume that yes, ratepayers can expect to keep seeing higher prices. Duke Energy representatives emphasized that they have to make upgrades to existing resources to increase reliability, while at the same time adding new resources to generate more energy.

Company representatives also really stressed that over the long term, as more large load customers join the system, that should alleviate rates. But it’s my understanding that that downward pressure won’t happen until at least another 15 years.

Another important topic that was discussed is energy generation. How are we going to produce all this energy? Data centers want energy as quickly as possible, and fossil fuels like natural gas and coal can meet this large demand quickly. But we have to remember that there’s a backdrop here of reaching net zero carbon emissions in North Carolina by 2050. Under state law, Duke Energy has to be carbon free by then.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a8ea988/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1075+0+230/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F35%2F5c%2Ff7d0261440238241cca7e61e5356%2Fimg-6981.JPEG,N,,2025-10-17 12:13:37.691490

The Northern Indiana Public Service Company (NIPSCO) announced that applications are now open for several energy assistance programs.

Those who are eligible can apply through May 31, 2026, or until funds run out.

The programs provide residents with a one-time benefit up to $550 per year to help cover gas utility bills.

PROGRAM ELIGIBILITY

The available programs include NIPSCO Hardship, Seniors in Indiana Low-Income and Vulnerable Energy Resources (SILVER) and Supply Energy Resources to Veterans (SERV).

Each program has different eligibility limits.

NIPSCO Hardship is a program that helps customers whose income is right above the federal poverty guidelines for LIHEAP, or the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program.

NIPSCO Hardship offers gas bill assistance to households with incomes between 151% and 250% of the federal poverty level.

SERV is designed to help active military members and veterans who require financial assistance for their past-due NIPSCO residential gas accounts.

SILVER is for customers 60 and older, and they must also have an active, past-due NIPSCO gas account to be eligible.

Officials noted that gas usage spikes between November and March, which can take up a large chunk of energy bills.

“It’s important for customers to be prepared for the winter heating season,” NIPSCO President and COO Vince Parisi said in a press release.

“We encourage customers to explore the energy assistance programs available, which are there to help our most vulnerable community members stay safe and warm throughout the season.”

APPLY ASAP

NIPSCO dedicated an entire website page to its relief programs, which residents can use to apply for assistance.

The service company said applicants should allow up to 30 business days for their applications to be processed.

If an applicant meets all the requirements, a one-time credit will be automatically applied to their gas account.

“Customers are encouraged to check their eligibility and apply for these programs as soon as possible,” NIPSCO advised.

“They are also urged to share this information with family, neighbors and friends who may qualify.”

NIPSCO has additional assistance programs like its flexible payment plans, which allow customers to use three, six and 12-month payment plans.

A Cameron Parish judge has ruled that state officials violated the Louisiana Constitution when they issued a permit for a liquified gas export terminal, which has halted construction on the facility.

The decision, reached Friday, found that the Louisiana Department of Conservation and Energy (formerly Energy and Natural Resources) failed to consider the environmental impacts on surrounding communities when it approved a permit for the Commonwealth LNG export facility.

The halted Commonwealth facility is one of six LNG export projects proposed, approved or operating along Cameron’s coast. Construction of the pipelines, storage tanks and shipping facilities that make up the facility would dig up or fill nearly 200 acres of wetlands and water bottoms, according to the project’s coastal use permit application.

Judge Penelope Richard cited the close vicinity of other export terminals as a factor in her decision, saying the state “failed to consider the secondary and cumulative impacts” of these facilities on climate change in the coastal zone.

“We hope this ruling shakes Louisiana to its senses,” said Anne Rolfes, director of Louisiana Bucket Brigade. “The coastal use permit needs to be revoked.”

Rolfes’s organization, the Sierra Club and the Turtle Island Restoration Network filed the suit in August 2024.

“This is an area of the Louisiana coastline that is being devastated by LNG facilities,” said Joanie Steinhaus, ocean program director for Turtle Island Restoration Network. “These agencies have long ignored the cumulative impact to air and water quality and the health of the local community members and the environment”

There was no immediate response to attempts Tuesday to reach Commonwealth LNG about the court ruling.

Another lawsuit in a U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit rejected the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s approval of the project, citing its pollution impact. The decision delayed construction for two months until a new permit reevaluated the full impact of air pollution harms.

The state permit for Commonwealth LNG will be suspended until the Office of Coastal Management considers climate change and environmental justice concerns in its evaluation, according to Judge Richard’s ruling.

The Government is also consulting on mandatory community benefits for communities hosting ground-mount solar, meaning families who live near a solar farm would directly benefit through funding that can be spent on local priorities, like new education schemes, new grassroots football pitches or better transport links. Developers for the Tillbridge project have committed to ensuring the local community benefits from the project.

Climate change is creating new challenges for Great Lakes coastal communities.

To tackle these hazards, the Niagara Peninsula Conservation Authority launched the Lake Ontario Coastal Resilience Pilot Project last summer.

Over the next four years, the project aims to engage communities in developing a coastal resilience plan.

The plan outlines strategies for improving environmental, social, political and economic conditions to safeguard communities along a waterfront.

In Ontario, coastal climate impacts are evident through increased water levels, erosion and flooding, threatening homes, businesses and essential infrastructure.

Recent climate events have caused billions of dollars in flooding damage to Lake Ontario communities, including torrential rains in 2024 and record-high 100-year water levels in 2019.

“When we talk about most coastal communities down here in Niagara, we’re talking about built environments, natural environments, diversity of agriculture and economy, and also the social connection to the lake itself and the environment,” said Leilani Lee-Yates, the chief administrative officer of the Niagara Peninsula Conservation Authority.

The authority is partnering with Conservation Halton and the Hamilton Conservation Authority on the project. They operate under Conservation Ontario, which represents the province’s 36 conservation authorities.

Conservation authorities are local, nonprofit organizations with jurisdiction over a particular watershed.

They help communities create coastal resilience plans through science-based research to support growth and shoreline protection into the future, Lee-Yates said.

They are also exploring other types of shoreline protection measures.

Nature-based solutions use natural resources to prevent further shoreline erosion, unlike gray infrastructure, which relies on materials like metal or concrete.

The Lake Ontario Coastal Resilience Pilot Project will determine the most optimal course of action, which may use a combination of both techniques.

The authority will also collaborate with the Global Centre for Climate Change and Transboundary Waters and the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence Cities Initiative. These organizations approach coastal resiliency from complementary angles.

“Our side is we’re looking at what are the socio-demographic, economic, governance and policy challenges that these climate imperatives are going to present for governance and community and political action in these areas,” said co-principal investigator Carolyn Johns of the Global Centre for Climate Change and Transboundary Waters .

The Lake Ontario Coastal Resilience Pilot Project is one of three pilot projects under Natural Resource Canada’s Climate-Resilient Coastal Communities Program. The multi-jurisdictional collaboration on this project spans northern Lake Superior, southern Lake Huron and western Lake Ontario.

“We’re really interested in populations that may not historically or traditionally be engaged in conservation authority work in watershed work, environmental work and specifically coastal resilience work,” Johns said.

Groups to be included are farmers, developers, anglers, Indigenous communities and youth.

Combined, the three projects have secured $4.9 million in funding. The Southern Lake Huron Littoral Cell Adaptation Plan is the furthest along, with two of its five years completed.

“Part of our project is teasing out what are all the current policies and laws that affect coastal resilience,” Johns said.

Johns and her team are identifying which policies could help local communities become more resilient. They are also examining which policies require innovation and adaptation.

“For instance, they might be designed to regulate flood zones, and those flood zones may have been based on some historical information and not really based on the current climate context,” Johns said.

The Niagara Peninsula Conservation Authority has connected with other diverse partners on the project to achieve these goals. One is the Mississaugas of the Credit First Nation, which “is so happy to join our partners in stewardship to restore, preserve and protect our coastal areas within our treaty territory,” Chief Claire Sault said in an email.

“I’m grateful that we have many valued allies who value this important work and initiative,” Sault said.

The name “Mississaugas” comes from the Anishinaabemowin word, “Missisakis,” which means “many river mouths.” The Mississaugas trace their name to the Trent, Moira, Shannon, Napanee, Kingston and Gananoque rivers.

Part of their vision is to safeguard the environment for future generations, a goal shared by the Lake Ontario Coastal Resilience Pilot Project.

By evaluating the current factors that contribute to coastal resilience in lakes Ontario, Huron and Superior, the Climate-Resilient Coastal Communities Program seeks to share best practices across all Ontario coastal communities.

“It’s very important because the Great Lakes are facing climate change and the communities that are going to grapple with that and need to adapt the most are the coastal communities,” Johns said. “The scale of this is really important because it’s really where the impacts are felt.”",https://greatlakesecho.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/COASTAL-RESILIENCE-AUTHORITIES-1170x780.jpg,N,,2025-10-17 13:12:30.015110

Continuing long-standing support for Bruce Power and its operations and projects, delegates to the Building Trades’ 68th Annual Convention in Windsor passed a resolution re-affirming their commitment to collaborating to further the company’s Life-Extension Program and MCR project, as well as new opportunities with the Bruce C Project, which could see the development of a new nuclear build on the Bruce Power site.

“The Ontario government’s Integrated Energy Plan – Energy for Generations – recognizes Bruce Power’s critical role in securing the future of the province’s clean energy supply, as well as the possibility of new nuclear through its Bruce C project,” said Marc Arsenault, Business Manager and Secretary-Treasurer of the Provincial Building and Construction Trades Council of Ontario. “Thanks to the hard work and dedication of Building Trades workers at Bruce Power, refurbishments are advancing safely, with quality, and on schedule, and the Bruce C project would create and sustain thousands of direct and indirect jobs during construction and operation.”

During the design and construction phase of Bruce C, it is estimated that more than 20,000 jobs would be created or supported nationally each year. Across the entire project lifespan, an estimated 12,000 full-time equivalent jobs would be created or supported annually in Canada.

The Building Trades Council resolution also called on the government to bolster its plans through policy certainty by “unlocking investment through Investment Tax Credits (ITCs) and other innovative financing models, Indigenous participation, and supply chain and workforce collaboration.”

As part of its resolution, the Building Trades highlighted the large economic footprint that Bruce Power projects have, including creating an estimated 22,000 jobs directly and indirectly from operations, and an additional 5,000 jobs annually throughout the investment program. The Building Trades are proactively collaborating with Bruce Power, site contractors, and the local community to help diversify the construction workforce needed to supply these projects, to include more Indigenous employees, women, returning veterans and reservists, and underemployed youth.

,EVs,2025-10-17 14:57:50+00:00,InsideEVs,'That Goal Has Been Achieved': Norway's Shift To EVs Is Nearly Complete - InsideEVs,Andrei Nedelea,,,,,https://insideevs.com/news/776141/norway-phase-out-ev-incentives/,"Norway's finance minister argues the country's transition to electric propulsion is pretty much complete and the incentive isn't needed anymore.
New EVs bought in the Nordic nation are exempt from import duties, paying road tax, registration tax and value-added tax (VAT).
If you buy a new EV in Norway and it exceeds 500,000 crowns ($49,600), you will pay full VAT for anything above that value.
So if a vehicle costs 600,000 crowns ($$59,500), then you have to pay 25% tax on the 100,000 crowns ($9,920) over the limit, so an additional 25,000 crowns ($2,480).
According to Reuters, Norway wants to proceed toward eliminating incentives because the country has already achieved its EV goal.","Nearly all new cars in Norway are electric now, so a plan to phase out subsidies is underway. There's now a proposal to phase out a tax exemption for EVs by 2027.

The plan is to lower the threshold for eligibility in 2026 before completely removing this benefit the following year.

Norway's finance minister argues the country's transition to electric propulsion is pretty much complete and the incentive isn't needed anymore.

The end of the $7,500 federal tax credit for electric vehicles in the U.S. was definitely premature since the market is not even close to reaching a turning point in the shift to EVs. It was a useful incentive that made a difference. But in Norway, the EV shift has happened almost completely, so the subsidy phaseout will happen because government officials say the country no longer needs it.

Most new cars bought in Norway have been electric for a few years, and that won’t change once the government no longer actively incentivizes people to go electric. New EVs bought in the Nordic nation are exempt from import duties, paying road tax, registration tax and value-added tax (VAT). The latter alone is 25% so it makes for significant savings for the buyer.

This is all money that the Norwegian government could have collected, but instead opted not to in order to help accelerate EV adoption. And accelerate it did, with EV sales outpacing combustion cars for a few years now. The proportion of new cars that are electric grows from month to month and in September it reached 98.3%. These are pure electric vehicles, so they do not include plug-in hybrids.

If you buy a new EV in Norway and it exceeds 500,000 crowns ($49,600), you will pay full VAT for anything above that value. So if a vehicle costs 600,000 crowns ($$59,500), then you have to pay 25% tax on the 100,000 crowns ($9,920) over the limit, so an additional 25,000 crowns ($2,480).

For an electric vehicle costing 500,000 crowns, Norwegian buyers save 125,000 crowns ($12,400) in tax, which makes it one of the best EV incentives available anywhere in the world. This is before factoring in any of the exemptions, which sweeten the deal further.

Now there is a proposal to lower the threshold for the all-important VAT exemption as of next year, where only vehicles costing less than 300,000 crowns ($29,800) would be fully exempt. EV buyers would pay full VAT for anything over. This means most vehicles among the top 10 best-selling models would no longer qualify, so the price the buyer would end up paying would be significantly higher than today.

According to Reuters, Norway wants to proceed toward eliminating incentives because the country has already achieved its EV goal. The country’s finance minister, Jens Stoltenberg, said ""We have had a goal that all new passenger cars should be electric by 2025, and... we can say that the goal has been achieved. Therefore, the time is ripe to phase out the benefits.""

The plan is to completely eliminate the VAT exemption by 2027, but the news has been met with resistance from pro-EV groups in Norway, like the Norwegian EV Association. It points to the fact that even though EVs dominate new car sales in the country, 70% of all cars on the road still burn fuel—so it’s hard to say that the shift to EVs has been completed. It's going to take a long time to replace all of them, if that can even be done.

All these benefits have definitely helped Norway go electric more quickly than without them. The same is true in the U.S., where the federal tax credit resulted in more EV purchases. Now that it’s been phased out, the rate of EV adoption in the U.S. will slow down, although it did see a final spike in September, the last month when people could still claim $7,500 on a new EV or up to $4,000 if they were buying used.

Meanwhile, Germany has announced plans to reintroduce a new EV subsidy program in the form of a purchase incentive of up to €4,000 ($4,675) starting in 2026. The only caveat is that buyers here will be eligible depending on their income.

Germany’s EV incentive is relatively small by European standards, as many countries will subsidize up to €10,000, although usually not more than half of the vehicle’s value and some places like Romania require you to scrap an old car to qualify for the incentive.",https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/P3oZO4/s1/hyundai-ioniq-5-powers-reindeer-farm-in-northern-norway.jpg,N,,2025-10-17 13:11:09.359415

The State of Michigan and 23 other grant recipients also filed suit in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims to recover damages (PDF) for the EPA’s unlawful breach of the grant agreements that were executed under this program.

Congress created the Solar for All program in 2022 as part of the Inflation Reduction Act, directing the EPA to make competitive grants to states and other entities to deploy solar projects in low-income and disadvantaged areas. The EPA selected recipients and awarded all of the program funds to plaintiff states and other grant recipients by August 2024. Michigan and the other plaintiffs moved forward with planning projects and working with stakeholders to develop their solar programs, but the EPA abruptly and unlawfully terminated the program two months ago and clawed back the vast majority of the money already awarded. That has left Michigan and the other plaintiffs without access to the funds to proceed with their solar programs, after the states spent significant time planning and launching programs and committing state funds.

In 2024, Michigan’s Solar for All program was awarded approximately $156 million by the EPA. The Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy selected and announced 13 pilot projects across the state to begin implementing Solar for All-funded initiatives, with a second round of grantees planned for 2025. The loss of $156 million in federal funding has halted these projects and denied disadvantaged communities across Michigan the benefits the program was designed to deliver.

“The Trump Administration’s decision to illegally rescind congressionally approved grants – funds that were already being put to work in our communities – is unlawful and deeply harmful to residents across Michigan and the country,” Nessel said. “We’ve seen this playbook from the White House before. The administration has tried to pull the same stunt by canceling congressionally mandated programs, and we stopped them then. We plan to do the same now to ensure the Trump Administration cannot unlawfully strip away these important investments that lower energy costs and make clean energy more accessible to Michigan families.”

“I applaud Attorney General Nessel for standing up for Michigan families and challenging the EPA’s decision to revoke funding for the MI Solar for All program. This program is a critical investment in our state’s energy future — lowering costs for low-income households, creating good-paying local jobs, and helping us achieve greater energy independence,” said Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy Director Phil Roos. “It would expand access to clean, affordable solar energy while supporting Michigan’s economy and American manufacturing. We remain committed to fighting for this program and the thousands of Michiganders it would benefit.”

Attorney General Nessel and a multistate coalition alleged in the lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington, among other things, that the EPA violated the Administrative Procedure Act and the U.S. Constitution’s Separation of Powers Doctrine in unlawfully canceling the program.

Attorney General Nessel was joined by the attorneys general of Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaiʻi, Illinois, Massachusetts, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and the District of Columbia in filing this complaint. Also joining the complaint are the governors of Kentucky and Pennsylvania, as well as the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation.

Separately, Attorney General Nessel joined a related lawsuit that was filed in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims. In that complaint, the states and other entities argue the EPA breached the clear terms of the agreements with states and other grantees and violated the duty of good faith and fair dealing in canceling their Solar for All grants. The plaintiff states seek money damages, interest, and fees.

Last week, a judge from Louisiana's 38th Judicial District Court effectively halted construction of Commonwealth LNG by ordering state regulators to analyze the facility's climate change and environmental justice-related impacts, in conjunction with the broader LNG buildout in southwest Louisiana's Cameron Parish.

Three of the nation's eight existing LNG export terminals are located in Cameron Parish, and several more are proposed or under construction there.

Louisiana's attorney general vowed to appeal the ruling, which vacated the Louisiana Department of Conservation and Energy's coastal use permit for the facility.

""This is the first time any court has vacated a permit for an LNG facility based on the government's refusal to consider climate change impacts,"" said Clay Garside, an attorney representing the Sierra Club and other environmental groups.

Earlier this year, Trump reversed a Biden-era pause on exports of liquefied natural gas, or LNG, as part of his goal to boost natural gas exports and promote ""energy dominance.""

Last year, the Biden administration's Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm's had warned that ""unfettered exports"" of liquefied natural gas would increase planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions — a statement reflecting the findings of a Department of Energy report released in December.

Trump-appointed Energy Secretary Chris Wright, a fossil fuel executive, has moved to fast-track the buildout of LNG facilities, including Commonwealth LNG, which received an export authorization within weeks of Trump's inauguration.

""Cameron Parish is ground zero for the relentless expansion of the gas export industry,"" said Anne Rolfes, founder of the Louisiana Bucket Brigade, an environmental group involved in the litigation. ""We're going to stop it and this is an important step in that process.""

Lyle Hanna, a Commonwealth LNG spokesperson, said that ""we are disappointed with the District Court's decision, and we are exploring all available legal options.""

A spokesperson for the Louisiana Department of Conservation and Energy declined to comment, citing the potential of pending litigation. Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill said that the state planned to appeal.

""Sadly even state court judges are not immune from climate activism,"" Murrill said.

Last year, a federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., had ordered the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to reassess Commonwealth LNG's air pollution, including its greenhouse gas emissions. In June, the commission gave the project a greenlight on the grounds that its construction was in the public interest.

In regulatory filings, the Louisiana Department of Conservation and Energy said that ""climate change is currently beyond the scope"" of the state's regulatory review.

But District Judge Penelope Richard rejected this position, saying state environmental regulators have a duty to consider how the LNG facility, along with others clustered nearby, would impact extreme weather events, storm severity and sea-level rise in a state where a football field-worth of land disappears every 100 minutes.

Richard also ordered state regulators to analyze the facility's impacts on local communities, especially those living in poverty or relying on fishing for their livelihoods — which she noted was the ""defining characteristic"" of the parish. While the facility could destroy marshes, harm water quality and displace residents, the judge wrote, ""none of it was considered in terms of impacts on environmental justice communities.""

Commercial fisherman Eddie LeJuine, a lifelong Cameron Parish resident, applauded the ruling. He said the buildout of LNG infrastructure, including dredging for shipping channels, has significantly harmed the fishing industry.

""The fishermen are barely hanging on with a thread,"" LeJuine said. ""These plants are killing the estuary and killing our livelihoods. We're getting extinct.""

In August, a dredging channel being developed by LNG firm Venture Global leaked into a nearby estuary. Local fishermen like LeJuine say the onslaught of saltwater and sediment will kill off large amounts of oyster, crab and fish.

Venture Global, which is in the process of constructing a second LNG export terminal in the parish, said it is ""committed to conservation"" and is working with state regulators and the community to respond to the incident.",https://img.manufacturing.net/mindful/im/workspaces/default/uploads/2025/10/lng.rcSNNyT8cu.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&crop=focalpoint&fit=max&fp-x=0.56&fp-y=0.25&q=70&w=1200,N,,2025-10-17 15:03:52.606706

Electric vehicles made up 11% of total new car purchases during those months, topping the earlier peak of 8.7%. Buyers flooded showrooms before federal tax incentives disappeared at the end of September.

The sales boom showed that a strong appetite exists for electric transportation among American drivers. Sticker prices have come down enough that 11 different electric models now sell for less than what the typical new car costs. The Chevrolet Equinox carries a starting price near $35,000, while Chevy's redesigned Bolt sells for $29,000.

Switching to electric vehicles improves air quality nationwide. Fewer gasoline-burning engines on roads means less pollution is released into the air people breathe.

Emily Almaer lives in Boulder, Colorado, with her three children and leases a Volkswagen ID.4 for $250 each month. Three friends of hers also purchased electric vehicles recently.

""You look at some of these [monthly payments],"" her husband, Dion Almaer, said, per Bloomberg, ""and it's like, 'Wait, this is like one family meal out.'""

Tesla has maintained its position as market leader but faces competition. Its share of the market has shrunk from 80% four years ago to 41% now as rival automakers roll out budget-friendly choices. General Motors took 15% of third-quarter sales, climbing from 10% during the same stretch last year.

What comes next may prove more difficult without government subsidies. Forecasters expect a temporary sales slowdown as shoppers adapt to paying full price. But according to BloombergNEF, about 50% of people who bought electric vehicles during the first half of the year did so without receiving government assistance. This move demonstrates that demand exists even outside of incentive programs.

Comparing GM’s current multiple of 8.4x to its Fair Ratio of 15.1x, the company still trades at a significant discount.","If you are eyeing General Motors stock and wondering whether now is the right moment to jump in or hold tight, you are not alone. The stock has been on quite the ride lately, with headlines buzzing about potential changes that could shift the whole industry landscape. In just the past week, GM’s share price climbed 2.5%, even after dipping a bit over the last 30 days. Zooming out, the picture gets even more interesting: up 11.6% since the start of the year, 17.4% over the past twelve months, and a massive 77% in the last three years. Clearly, something is in motion.

So, what is driving this? Two developments stand out. First, the White House is preparing to ease tariffs for automakers, which could mean lower costs and higher margins for GM in the future. Second, GM’s bet on producing rare-earth magnets in the U.S. is paying off, putting the company in a strong position with supply chain advantages that few rivals can match. Although not every plan went smoothly, with GM recently scrapping a last-minute strategy around electric vehicle tax credits, the overall sentiment around risk appears to be changing to the company’s benefit.

When we turn to valuation, GM scores an impressive 5 out of 6 on our value checklist, signaling that the stock may still be flying under the radar for many investors. But numbers alone only tell part of the story. Next, we will look at how each valuation approach weighs in, and why there might be an even better way to assess the company’s true worth than you might expect.

Approach 1: General Motors Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis

The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is designed to estimate a company’s intrinsic value by projecting its future cash flows and discounting them back to present-day dollars. For General Motors, analysts start by looking at its current Free Cash Flow, which over the last twelve months stands at $13.05 billion. This figure sets the benchmark for future growth scenarios.

Forecasts suggest that by 2029, General Motors’ annual Free Cash Flow will be about $8.6 billion. Analyst estimates for the next five years show some variance, with cash flow projections between $7 billion and $8.6 billion per year. Beyond this period, Simply Wall St continues the projection through to 2035, resulting in estimates of over $10 billion in annual Free Cash Flow within the next decade.

When all these cash flows are discounted and summed, the DCF model arrives at a fair value of $89.84 per share for GM. This figure is 36.2% higher than the company’s current share price. This points to meaningful potential upside and suggests the stock is undervalued at present.

Result: UNDERVALUED

Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests General Motors is undervalued by 36.2%. Track this in your or , or discover more .

Approach 2: General Motors Price vs Earnings

For profitable companies like General Motors, the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio is a widely recognized measure for valuation because it shows how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings generated. As a company’s future growth opportunities expand or its perceived risks decline, its “normal” or “fair” PE ratio tends to rise. This reflects improved expectations for returns and stability. On the other hand, higher risks or slower growth typically lead to lower PE ratios being considered fair.

Currently, GM trades at 8.4x earnings. This is notably below both the average PE ratio for its industry, which is 19.2x, and the average of its direct peers at 18.5x. At first glance, this sizable discount could suggest undervaluation. However, headline comparisons do not always tell the full story.

This is where Simply Wall St’s “Fair Ratio” comes into play. The Fair Ratio for GM is calculated at 15.1x, which takes into account the company’s specific factors, such as growth outlook, profit margins, market cap, and unique risks, alongside its role in the auto industry. Unlike a simple peer or industry comparison, the Fair Ratio aims to tailor the benchmark to what is really relevant for GM, providing a more precise yardstick for value.

Comparing GM’s current multiple of 8.4x to its Fair Ratio of 15.1x, the company still trades at a significant discount. This means that, based on these forward-looking and company-specific factors, GM appears undervalued on a PE basis.

Result: UNDERVALUED

PE ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? .

Upgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your General Motors Narrative

Earlier, we mentioned there is an even better way to understand valuation, so let’s introduce you to Narratives. A Narrative is simply the story you believe about a company, your perspective on where it’s headed and why, backed up by your own estimates for future revenue, profitability, and fair value. Narratives connect the dots between what’s happening on the ground, your financial forecasts, and what you think GM should be worth, forming a clear and actionable investment thesis.

On Simply Wall St’s Community page, millions of investors use Narratives to share their views and track how their expectations compare to the current share price. Narratives help you decide when to buy or sell by highlighting the gap between fair value and market price, so you always know whether the opportunity matches your story. Even better, Narratives update in real time as news or earnings come out, so your thesis stays relevant.

For example, one investor’s Narrative for General Motors might predict robust electric vehicle growth and resilient margins, giving a bullish fair value of $80 per share. Another focused on risks from tariffs and EV adoption could justify a lower target of $38. Narratives let you define, refine, and act on your own investment rationale with confidence.

The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is fast-tracking the progress at the world’s most futuristic city, as it has now passed the 80% completion mark. The site will be powered by a massive green hydrogen and ammonia facility that is set for a 2026 startup date.

NEOM Green Hydrogen Project in Saudi Arabia has reached an 80% construction completion mark

The NEOM Green Hydrogen Project exemplifies the current evolution of the global energy sector. Over the past decade, the global community has seen a significant increase in the renewable energy sector as the world leaves the coal and gas sectors in the rear-view mirror.

The NEOM Green Hydrogen Project is reaching the 80% completion mark across its vast array of facilities, including its wind garden, solar farm, and transmission grid. The project noted the successful delivery and installation of crucial equipment, including wind turbines, hydrogen storage vessels, electrolyzers, a cold box, and pipe racks.

NEOM Green Hydrogen Company boasts that the project is the world’s largest’ green hydrogen-based ammonia production facility run on renewable energy. The project is an equal production joint venture of ACWA Power, Air Products, and NEOM. Air Products, which is a US-based company, noted the progress being made.

“The 4 GW solar and wind power generation sites are scheduled for completion by mid-2026, with first ammonia product availability expected in 2027.” – Air Products spokesperson

NEOM Green Hydrogen Company has initiated a major recruitment campaign for the facility

As NEOM nears completion, the project will need to recruit more employees. In that regard, several job openings have been posted by the project management. The facility has cost approximately $8.4 billion to date and will continue to expand its operational readiness as it nears completion.

In 2016, Saudi Crown Prince and Prime Minister Mohammed bin Salman announced Saudi Vision 2030, which calls for a more diversified economy, society, and culture in the Kingdom. The CEO of the NEOM Green Hydrogen Company has noted that the project aligns perfectly with the Saudi Vision 2030 policy.

“By bringing together top talent from Saudi Arabia and around the world, we are building a skilled team to deliver the world’s largest green hydrogen plant and kick off operations, setting the stage for a cleaner and more sustainable energy future.” – Wesam Alghamdi, CEO of NEOM Green Hydrogen Company

The green hydrogen and ammonia projects emerging from several nations have catapulted the progress of the sector into the stratosphere, with huge solar-to-hydrogen and ammonia projects being planned in countries like Namibia.

Air Products will be the exclusive 30-year offtaker for the project, and will export the green hydrogen in the form of green ammonia to the international heavy industry and transportation sectors.

The history-heavy piece edition was by S. S. Wilson, then a lecturer in engineering at Oxford University.
With the aid of a bicycle, however, the man’s energy consumption for a given distance is reduced to about a fifth.
Therefore, apart from increasing his unaided speed by a factor of three or four, the cyclist improves his efficiency rating to No.
Using heat maps and the addition of a cyclist in a cycle covered with an aerodynamic fairing, Scientific American shows that propelling such a “velomobile” makes cycling even more energy efficient.","Fifty two years after Scientific American first declared a human propelling a bicycle to coasting speed more efficient than salmon, seagulls, or jet planes, the august magazine has revisited an iconic 1973 graph and the results hold firm: the cycle remains the planet’s most energy-efficient mode of transport.

The graph, much reproduced by cycle advocates and engineers down the years, was included in an 11-page article on bicycle technology that appeared in the March 1973 edition of Scientific American. The history-heavy piece edition was by S. S. Wilson, then a lecturer in engineering at Oxford University.

He wrote that the purpose of a bicycle was to “make it easier for an individual to move about, and this the bicycle achieves in a way that quite outdoes natural evolution.”

Wilson argued: “When one compares the energy consumed in moving a certain distance as a function of body weight for a variety of animals and machines, one finds that an unaided walking man does fairly well but he is not as efficient as a horse, a salmon or a jet transport. With the aid of a bicycle, however, the man’s energy consumption for a given distance is reduced to about a fifth. Therefore, apart from increasing his unaided speed by a factor of three or four, the cyclist improves his efficiency rating to No. 1 among moving creatures and machines.”

This extract, and the graph that accompanied it, went on to inspire many, including Steve Jobs of Apple, who used it in a 1980 presentation to explain the efficiency of the personal computer. Quoting the Scientific American article, he said: “What a computer is to me is it’s the most remarkable tool that we’ve ever come up with, and it’s the equivalent of a bicycle for our minds.”

Now Scientific American has updated and re-released what it calls the “classic graphic” that shows that a human on a bicycle—able to coast, or freewheel, without pedaling—remains the world’s most energy effecient traveler.

Using heat maps and the addition of a cyclist in a cycle covered with an aerodynamic fairing, Scientific American shows that propelling such a “velomobile” makes cycling even more energy efficient. (The world speed record for a human inside such a velomobile was set in 2016 by Canadian rider Todd Reichert: he peaked, on pedal power alone, at just a smidgen below 90 miles per hour.)

Tyson Hedrick, a comparative physiologist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill told today’s Scientific American that a cycle “turns a human into [an] hyperefficient terrestrial locomotor.”

ForbesBicycling Booms During Lockdown—But There's A Warning From History

Back in 1973, at the height of the 1970s bike boom, Wilson wrote of the cycle’s human-sized perfection: “It is because every part of the design must be related to the human frame that the entire bicycle must always be on a human scale. The lightness of construction, achieved mainly through the development of the wire-spoke wheel and the tubular frame, was dictated not only by the fact that the machine has to be pedaled uphill but also by the desirability of making it easy to lift. Since the bicycle makes little demand on material or energy resources, contributes little to pollution, makes a positive contribution to health and causes little death or injury, it can be regarded as the most benevolent of machines.”

He continued: “For those of us in the overdeveloped world the bicycle offers a real alternative to the automobile.”

The possible inducements of more cycling are many, he stated, including “cycleways to reduce the danger to cyclists of automobile traffic, bicycle parking stations, facilities for the transportation of bicycles by rail and bus, and public bicycles for ‘park and pedal’ service. Already bicycling is often the best way to get around quickly in city centers.”

He concluded: “If one were to give a short prescription for dealing rationally with the world’s problems of development, transportation, health and the efficient use of resources, one could do worse than the simple formula: Cycle and recycle.”",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/68f2338d99e4ecf085367557/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-10-17 12:16:16.435065
