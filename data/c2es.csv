A new modeling approach that draws data from personal weather stations can more accurately capture air temperatures across U.S. cities, according to researchers in the Division of Translational Toxicology.

Heatwaves have grown more frequent in recent decades and are expected to intensify in the coming years. This trend is especially concerning in cities due to the urban heat island effect — a phenomenon in which urban areas are several degrees warmer than their surrounding rural areas. Exposure to extreme heat can increase the risk of cardiovascular, respiratory, and kidney diseases. However, most U.S. cities do not monitor weather patterns in enough detail to generate the data scientists need for epidemiological studies.

To address this limitation, the researchers developed a model that estimates hourly air temperatures to which people are exposed with high spatial resolution — meaning it can detect local phenomena such as overheating neighborhoods and the cooling effect of parks. In doing so, they relied on an extensive network of personal weather stations. This approach resulted in accurate coverage of meteorological events such as heatwaves and snowstorms in Philadelphia, New York City, Phoenix, and the Triangle area in North Carolina.

The method also revealed that densely populated neighborhoods are more likely to experience high temperatures and longer, warmer nights. According to the authors, their model could strengthen future epidemiological studies of heat-related health effects. In addition, the approach could improve heatwave alerts that are tailored to specific regions to protect vulnerable populations. (JW) (See related article.)

Pesticides linked to higher rheumatoid arthritis risk in farm women

Exposure to organochlorine and organophosphate insecticides, and other pesticides, may raise the risk of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in farm women, according to NIEHS researchers and collaborators. The study is the largest to examine pesticide exposures in relation to RA in this population, and the first to also consider indirect exposures due to applicators’ use.

Growing evidence shows that farming and pesticide use may contribute to RA. However, few studies have examined the effects of specific pesticides on RA risk among women living on farms, where they may be personally or indirectly exposed to pesticides.

To address this gap, the researchers investigated RA incidence among female spouses of licensed private pesticide applicators/farmers in the Agricultural Health Study. They assessed both personal use of 32 specific pesticides by spouses and indirect exposures based on applicators’ use.

They found that personal use of several insecticides – the organochlorine DDT and lindane, the organophosphates coumaphos and malathion, the carbamate called carbofuran, and permethrin – was associated with higher RA risk. Spouses’ RA risk was also associated with personal use of the use of the herbicide metribuzin, and fungicides captan and metalaxyl. Among women who did not personally apply pesticides, RA risk was also greater in those with indirect exposure to the insecticide carbaryl, the herbicide metribuzin and the fungicides maneb/mancozeb.

These findings suggest that both personal and indirect use of certain pesticides may contribute to RA in women. The authors recommend future studies on the role of contemporary insecticides also widely used for residential and public health purposes. (MD)

How a key protein controls mRNA stability

A protein called tristetraprolin (TTP) promotes the decay of specific mRNAs by interacting with multiple molecular partners, according to NIEHS researchers and their collaborators at the National Cancer Institute.

TTP is an RNA-binding protein that controls the stability of mRNA in cells. Specifically, TTP promotes the decay of a subset of mRNAs that contain particular target motifs. Many of these mRNAs encode cytokines involved in the inflammatory and innate immune responses. Deficiency of TTP in mice leads to a severe systemic inflammatory syndrome with arthritis, osteopenia, and autoimmunity. TTP expression is frequently down-regulated in human cancers, and this is often correlated with poor patient prognosis and tumor progression. However, the precise mechanisms by which TTP controls mRNA stability and influences disease development have remained unclear.

The researchers show that TTP regulates mRNA stability by interacting directly with the CCR4–NOT complex, a large multiprotein complex that degrades mRNA by promoting the stepwise loss of the polyA tail. TTP also promotes mRNA decay by binding to PABPC1, a protein that typically enhances mRNA stability by binding to the polyA tail. The results highlight the ability of TTP to simultaneously interact with different protein molecules to effectively destabilize mRNA, and thus rapidly affect gene expression in response to environmental cues or stress signals.

Future studies will be needed to determine the structural basis of these interactions, and whether altering these interactions could affect the wide range of diseases linked to disrupted mRNA stability. (JW)

A sugar called hyaluronan can help treat viral infections

Treatment with a natural lung-repairing molecule called hyaluronan improves outcomes in mice and humans infected with viruses, according to NIEHS researchers and their collaborators.

Viral lung infections such as influenza and COVID-19 are a major cause of illness and deaths worldwide. Many existing treatments do not prevent adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a life-threatening condition characterized by severe lung inflammation, tissue damage, and fluid buildup. There is also a critical need for treatments that could be rapidly deployed against a wide range of emerging viral infections.

To address this problem, the researchers examined the potential therapeutic properties of high molecular weight hyaluronan (HMWHA), a sugar found in healthy tissue that reduces inflammation and promotes lung repair. Mice were infected with influenza or SARS-Cov2, which causes COVID-19, and treated with either HMWHA or saline control. HMWHA increased survival rates in mice infected with either virus by reducing inflammation and limiting viral movement through mucus.

In humans, inhaled HMWHA improved outcomes in patients with severe COVID-19, shortening ventilator use and hospital stays among older patients with acute respiratory failure. According to the authors, the study lays the foundation for future clinical trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of HMWHA as a broad-spectrum antiviral therapy. (JW)

Simplifying single-cell datasets

A powerful computational tool called GIBOOST enhances the visualization and interpretability of single-cell datasets to provide critical biological insights, according to NIEHS researchers and their collaborators.

High-dimensional, single-cell data consists of complex measurements of many features from individual cells, such as gene expression, protein levels, and signaling activity. These datasets are important for characterizing the molecular mechanisms underlying various diseases. However, these datasets are often challenging to visualize and interpret, limiting insights into disease progression or drug responses.

To address this challenge, the researchers developed a computational framework called GIBOOST, which is driven by artificial intelligence (AI). GIBOOST offers a holistic view of the data by combining the strengths of existing tools while minimizing their limitations. The tool reduces the complexity of the data while preserving essential features, enabling effective visualization and interpretation.

The researchers showed that GIBOOST provides superior visualization of cell-cell communication and cellular transitions during processes such as sperm cell production and placenta development compared with standard methods. This approach could enable researchers to obtain a more comprehensive understanding of complicated, dynamic biological processes across different tissues and disease states. Ultimately, this information could support the development of effective treatments and the promotion of optimal health. (JW)

Chemical health hazards following train derailment identified

A new literature review by NIEHS researchers and their collaborators highlights the potential health consequences of chemical releases following disasters such as train derailments.

In 2023, a Norfolk Southern Railway train derailed in East Palestine, Ohio, exposing nearby residents to toxic chemicals released into the air, water, and soil. To prevent an explosion, emergency responders conducted a vent and burn of five rail cars containing a carcinogenic gas called vinyl chloride.

To better understand the disaster’s potential health hazards, the researchers conducted a literature review of studies on 22 chemicals that may have been released after the derailment. Their analysis revealed that eight of these chemicals can irritate the skin, eyes, or respiratory tract, findings consistent with symptoms reported by community members and first responders.

The team also found that five of the chemicals are known to cause cancer, two may damage the immune or nervous system, and one could harm reproductive organs or fetal development. In addition, the researchers identified knowledge gaps that should be addressed in future studies. According to the authors, these insights could inform communication and health-monitoring strategies related to toxic chemical releases during derailments and other disasters.

Improving immunotherapies for allergic asthma

A new study has revealed a specific type of lung immune cell that reduces allergic reactions to inhaled allergens, according to NIEHS researchers and their collaborators.

Allergic asthma is a common disease triggered by immune reactions to allergens such as pollen, dust mites, and animal dander. Symptoms can include coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, and chest tightness. Currently, there remains an urgent need for immunotherapies that work quickly and improve patient adherence.

Toward this goal, the researchers investigated lung conventional dendritic cells (cDCs), which help promote tolerance to allergens. The results revealed that type 2 cDCs (cDC2s) express high levels of a protein called CD301b. These cells strongly activated T-regulatory (Treg) cells, which are known to suppress allergic responses. When transferred to mice, these cDC2s induced immunological tolerance to inhaled allergens.

The findings shed light on how cDCs and Treg cells develop and function in the lung, broadening the understanding of the cellular and molecular basis of asthma. According to the authors, future studies focusing on the newly characterized cDC2s may pave the way for improved strategies to prevent or treat allergic asthma. (JW)

Hair straightener/relaxer use may be linked to pancreatic cancer, thyroid cancer

Women who use hair straighteners may face a higher risk of developing various types of cancer, according to a new study by NIEHS researchers and their collaborators.

Hair products such as straighteners and chemical relaxers are widely used, despite previous findings linking them to increased risks of reproductive cancers (breast, ovarian, and uterine). Whether these products are associated with other types of cancer has been less clear. To help address this knowledge gap, the researchers analyzed data from 46, 287 women aged 35-74 years, tracking cancer diagnoses over an average follow up period of 13 years.

The results showed that use of hair straighteners and chemical relaxers at the time of enrollment was linked to higher rates of thyroid cancer, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and pancreatic cancer. The study participants were 84% non-Hispanic White women; thus, the authors emphasized the need for future research in more racially and ethnically diverse populations — particularly with more representation of Black and Hispanic women, who tend to use these products more frequently.

According to the authors, the findings broaden the understanding of potential health risks associated with chemical hair products. More research is needed to identify which ingredients contribute to cancer development and to clarify the biological mechanisms that may be involved in this process. (JW)

Airborne phthalates linked with high blood pressure

Exposure to phthalates emitted from industrial sources may increase the risk of high blood pressure, according to an NIEHS researcher and collaborator.

Phthalates are widely used chemicals found in personal care products, pharmaceuticals, and medical devices. As endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) that can be released into the air, they interfere with hormones and have been linked to a range of health problems. Although other EDCs have been associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes, the potential relationship between phthalate exposure and high blood pressure, or hypertension, remains unclear.

To investigate this question, the researchers analyzed interview responses and blood pressure measurements from 47,465 women participating in the Sister Study. They estimated exposure to phthalates based on a national air toxin database linked to participants’ home addresses. The results showed that higher levels of airborne phthalates were associated with an increased risk of hypertension, especially among women who were not non-Hispanic White.

Given the widespread presence of phthalates and the growing prevalence of hypertension, the findings have important public health implications. The authors noted that air quality regulations and environmental policies may be needed to reduce phthalate emissions. They also highlighted the importance of future studies to clarify how these chemicals may alter biological pathways that lead to hypertension or related health conditions. (JW)

How air pollution affects breast cancer in the U.S.

A large analysis, U.S.-based study led by NIEHS researchers and their collaborators shows that several air pollutants are linked to a higher risk of breast cancer.

Breast cancer incidence has steadily increased in the U.S. in recent decades. Previous research suggests that exposure to environmental chemicals and pollutants may contribute to this trend. For example, air pollution contains molecules that can act as carcinogens and can disrupt hormones, potentially contributing to the development of breast cancer. Yet limited evidence exists on how these associations may vary by breast tumor subtype or geographically, due to differing sources of pollutants.

The researchers analyzed data from five large U.S. cohorts, including more than 28,000 women diagnosed with breast cancer. The results revealed a positive association between residential exposure to nitrogen dioxide and breast cancer risk, consistent with previous studies. In addition, outdoor levels of fine particulate matter were associated with a higher breast cancer risk among participants living in the Midwest. Exposure to both fine particulate matter and ozone were associated with a higher risk of hormone receptor-negative tumors, which tend to grow more aggressively and respond to fewer treatment options.

According to the authors, air pollution may contribute to a larger number of breast cancer cases than previously recognized, given widespread environmental exposures and high rates of the disease. (JW)

Actions taken by EPA in 2025 to date demonstrate sustained TSCA enforcement, including with respect to chemical regulations and particularly chemical data reporting requirements. Environmental non-governmental organizations (NGOs) are also utilizing TSCA’s Section 20 citizen suit authority to bring lawsuits against companies over alleged reporting noncompliance as well. Chemical manufacturers and importers should stay apprised of these enforcement trends and proactively manage their TSCA compliance strategies to reduce enforcement and litigation risk.

EPA Enforcement in 2025

While the government has scaled back civil environmental enforcement in federal court, EPA’s administrative enforcement remains robust and appears to be accelerating. In the third quarter of calendar year 2025, EPA resolved 198 administrative enforcement actions across the statutes it administers—up from 179 case conclusions in the second quarter—and has assessed over $9 million in penalties. Although many of these cases likely were initiated during the prior administration, the continued settlement approvals reflect EPA’s focus on “core” enforcement work under the current administration.

EPA’s TSCA enforcement and compliance assurance program includes four key focus areas: new and existing chemicals, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), asbestos, and lead-based paint. From time to time, aspects of the TSCA enforcement program have been included amongst EPA’s national focus areas, as reflected in the National Enforcement and Compliance Initiatives that EPA selects on four-year cycles. TSCA enforcement largely is, however, part of “core” enforcement work, which Administrator Zeldin has made a priority for the agency.

Since the beginning of the current administration, EPA has pursued 115 new administrative enforcement actions and assessed approximately $4.3 million in penalties for TSCA violations. The vast majority of these cases (about 80 percent) concern lead-based paint regulation noncompliance, which have generally resulted in lower penalty assessments than chemicals enforcement actions. Of the ten largest TSCA penalties assessed this year to date, five were for chemicals enforcement actions. For example, the agency assessed its single largest TSCA penalty in 2025—$700,000—for violations of the TSCA Chemical Data Reporting (CDR) rule, where the respondent allegedly failed to report 334 imported chemicals for the 2024 reporting cycle. EPA assessed six‑figure penalties in three other CDR rule enforcement actions—$415,000, $393,000, and $112,155—as well as a $100,000 penalty for alleged violations of the methylene chloride risk management rule for paint removers.

NGO Lawsuits to Enforce TSCA CDR Violations

TSCA Section 20 also gives private citizens the authority to bring civil actions against companies in federal court for TSCA violations. TSCA allows private citizens to bring such suits so that a court can restrain the identified TSCA violations or compel EPA to enforce the law. Since 2021, NGOs have filed TSCA Section 20 actions against companies for alleged CDR violations and continue to do so with growing frequency. Two of the most recent lawsuits were filed earlier this fall by the NGO Center for Environmental Health (CEH). CEH alleged that certain chemical companies failed to report imported chemicals to EPA for the 2020 CDR reporting cycle.

The complaints in these cases detail how the NGOs identify potential violations by reviewing information on company imports and manufactured chemicals published in EPA’s CDR public database. NGOs have also asked the courts in these cases to 1) declare the companies violated TSCA, 2) order the companies to file corrected CDR reports with EPA, 3) restrain the companies from ongoing CDR violations, 4) order that the companies audit their manufacturing and import activities to identify other potential CDR violations, and 5) pay the NGO’s attorneys’ fees. Even when penalties are not imposed, responding to TSCA Section 20 claims can be costly and require the diversion of resources away from other business functions.

Companies should be aware of these types of civil actions because they can open the door to NGOs or other private citizens to pressure companies, as part of settlements, to agree to allow them to participate in company-led TSCA CDR (or broader) audits, which could potentially reveal additional TSCA violations.

What Companies Should Do

EPA administrative enforcement and citizen-filed lawsuits represent two significant legal risks for chemical manufacturers and importers subject to TSCA CDR rule requirements. Noncompliance can result in not only steep penalties but also business operational disruption. On the front end, manufacturers and importers should routinely review their own TSCA compliance programs and audit their own TSCA reporting compliance, which can also position companies to take advantage of EPA’s Audit Policy[1] where its conditions are met, potentially mitigating penalties for voluntarily disclosed noncompliance. Companies should also proactively prepare for the next CDR reporting cycle in 2028. Companies should also engage counsel early when responding to EPA inquiries or enforcement activity or notice of citizen lawsuits.

The recall covers Qin PLUS DM-i models manufactured between January 2021 and September 2023, according to a notice filed with the State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR).

The filing states that the problem stems from a “manufacturing consistency issue” in the power-battery packs.

This defect may lower the battery’s output and “potentially” cause the vehicle’s electric-drive mode to shut down in certain situations.

BYD plans to resolve the issue through over-the-air software updates to the affected vehicles’ diagnostic systems.

After the update, if an anomaly is detected in the battery, a warning will appear on the instrument panel instructing drivers to visit authorised service centres.

Under the recall programme, dealers will replace faulty battery packs at no cost to owners.

The action follows a defect probe opened by SAMR, which concluded that consistency problems in battery production could limit power output and, in rare cases, stop the cars from operating in pure electric mode.

The regulator’s move points to increased attention on the uniformity and quality of power-battery manufacturing among major electric vehicle producers in China.

This latest recall comes shortly after BYD initiated another large-scale action involving more than 115,000 vehicles in mid-October, including BYD Tang and BYD Yuan Pro models, over design flaws and battery-related safety concerns.

In September 2024, BYD also recalled close to 97,000 Dolphin and Yuan Plus electric cars due to a production defect in a steering control unit that created a fire hazard.

Many are good for upholding reliability while avoiding unnecessary costs. Others, however, give some cause for concern.

North Carolina is now three years into a Carbon Plan law that seeks to eliminate carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from electricity generation in the state by 2050. When the year opened, it included an interim goal of 70% reduction in CO2 emissions (from 2005 levels) by 2030. Incidentally, without a Carbon Plan, state emissions had fallen by more than half by 2023.

Developments concerning intermittent, unreliable generation

President Joe Biden had made “aggressive action” for offshore wind his Day-One priority. His signature legislation, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), contained open-ended grants and tax credits “on the order of trillions of dollars” for renewable energy sources, while his administration hamstrung natural gas.

President Donald Trump, however, made it a Day-One priority to halt new offshore wind projects and review existing wind projects. His signature legislation, the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” limited IRA tax credit eligibility for wind and solar facilities.

Conducted for Duke Energy, an independent evaluation of the state’s three offshore wind energy areas found they all compared unfavorably against a reference price based on solar plus batteries. So, Duke announced that it will not be pursuing offshore wind energy generation here.

In March, a meeting of the state Senate Committee on Agriculture, Energy, and the Environment revealed that the Carbon Plan’s interim goal was having an exaggerated effect on resource modeling by the North Carolina Utility Commission (NCUC). Legislators learned that removing the interim goal would save electricity consumers $13 billion by 2050.

Developments concerning reliable, thermal generation

In July, the General Assembly enacted Senate Bill (SB) 266 over Gov. Josh Stein’s veto, eliminating the Carbon Plan’s interim goal. It also expanded state law allowing utilities to charge ratepayers for construction work in progress while adding key guardrails on its use.

When a summer heat wave threatened to overload the grid, Duke Energy Carolinas obtained an emergency order from the US Department of Energy (DOE) to exceed environmental emissions levels if needed to maintain power provision. With nuclear already at peak production, Duke was able to avoid blackouts primarily by increasing coal generation by 30%, showing its importance to reliability.

In October, Duke filed an updated resource plan proposal with the NCUC as required by the Carbon Plan law. This filing reflected the developments described above. Compared with the previous plan, the new plan would double the planned amount of new natural gas combined-cycle capacity, increase new natural gas combustion-turbine capacity by well over a third, and up new nuclear capacity by about 40%. It would also increase new solar capacity by only about 3%, boost new battery storage by about 58%, and eliminate new wind resources (onshore and off). Finally, Duke would delay retirement of some coal capacity.

The plan represented a significant boost in reliable, thermal generation over the previous plan, a result anticipated by SB 266.

Caution ahead

In July, the DOE published a Resource Adequacy Report warning the nation of high blackout risks by 2030 from closing reliable power plants and replacing them insufficiently (mostly with intermittent renewables). The DOE report estimated the blackout risk in North Carolina to be 27 times worse by 2030 under the planned status quo. Unfortunately, the main changes in Duke’s latest resource plan would take place after 2030, not before.

The sort of problem the DOE report warned of occurred in Spain in April. Days after achieving the “first weekday of 100% renewable power,” the Spanish grid unexpectedly collapsed, causing billions of euros in economic losses. The culprit? Spain’s overreliance on renewables, especially solar generation, leaving very little inertia on the system from the heavy, spinning traditional generators that would allow it to withstand a sudden disturbance.

The Carbon Plan law placed North Carolina on that path. Even though SB 266 forestalls the problem, it still requires “carbon neutrality” by 2050. The new Duke proposal doesn’t add much more new solar than the previous one, but it plans for solar capacity nearly to quadruple. Comparably, it would increase nuclear and natural gas capacity by just 59%. Duke’s filing shows that new solar capacity would be only half as productive as new natural gas capacity and only about a fourth as productive as new nuclear capacity.

Policymakers should amend the Carbon Plan law to make carbon neutrality a goal instead of a mandate. The most important thing for power provision in North Carolina is meeting consumers’ need for reliable and least-cost electricity. Allowing Duke to showcase more natural gas and nuclear capacity in future resource plans would serve North Carolinians’ interests significantly better.",https://www.carolinajournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/DSC_4231-scaled-1.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 14:03:00.758381

But it comes at a time of deep uncertainty for the emerging carbon capture industry.
It also wants to sell the complex's proposed ammonia plant and carbon capture pieces — and potentially the company's rights to state-owned underground storage areas.
""Our intention is to operate the facility with carbon capture operational to the maximum extent possible, capturing 95 percent of our emissions.""
Six projects were fast-tracked under the order, but Air Products' permit wasn't one of them.","A controversial plan to store CO2 deep under Lake Maurepas was intended to greatly limit greenhouse gas emissions from a nearby industrial plant, but a new proposal raises the possibility that significantly less will be sequestered.

The company's revised proposal to state regulators has the potential to allow the hydrogen and ammonia plant in Ascension Parish to become one of the largest industrial emitters of greenhouse gases in Louisiana during its first years of operation.

Air Products, the company behind the project, has battled nearly four years of community opposition over plans to inject and permanently store CO2 and other greenhouse gases from the complex under Lake Maurepas. It says the injection would prevent 95% of those greenhouse gases from reaching the atmosphere, where they would otherwise add to climate change.

But, just months after receiving the state's blessing for air emissions based on that low-carbon vision, Air Products has asked for a do-over.

The proposed change could allow the Louisiana Clean Energy Complex to become among the top 25 industrial emitters of greenhouse gases in the state, based on LSU and federal annual emissions tallies since 2012.

The company says the new proposal would merely give the plant the flexibility it needs to operate, adding that its carbon capture goals remain the same.

But it comes at a time of deep uncertainty for the emerging carbon capture industry. Louisiana has paused new permit applications in the face of residents' opposition and criticism has grown louder over lucrative federal tax credits for the projects.

Some environmental groups, which have opposed carbon capture projects because they claim they won't live up to the storage rates being promised, speculated the air permit changes indicate the company is trying to hedge its bets.

The company has already delayed the complex's startup by two years to 2028 or 2029 for financial reasons, according to a report from RBN Energy, an industry consulting and analytics firm.

Air Products has said it is trying to ""derisk"" the $4.5 billion complex by finding buyers for its low-carbon products before new spending commitments. It also wants to sell the complex's proposed ammonia plant and carbon capture pieces — and potentially the company's rights to state-owned underground storage areas.

""It's all about making it a more valuable property for them to sell off,"" said Darryl Malek-Wiley, a senior organizer for the Sierra Club's environmental justice program in Louisiana.

Storage three-quarters of the time

In the new permit request filed in late September, Air Products wants permission to emit up to 2.16 million tons of greenhouse gases per year along with increases in some toxic chemicals. The maximum estimate is nearly half of the total that Air Products had planned to inject under Lake Maurepas annually, or more than 5.5 million tons per year.

Depending on the year, the projected maximum greenhouse gas emissions in the air would be on par with the ExxonMobil refinery and chemical complex power plant in Baton Rouge, Entergy's power plant in St. Charles Parish, and Dow Chemical in Plaquemine, the LSU and federal emissions tallies show.

Air Products told the state Department of Environmental Quality that when the company is commissioning the plant, it won't be able to inject CO2 underground for up to 25% of the time and that this inability could last in the first few years. For the other 75% of the time, the company says it will be able to inject under Lake Maurepas, as promised.

In a statement, an Air Products spokeswoman said the permit alterations don't reflect a change in the complex's design. It's an effort to create ""additional operational flexibility for the facility, ensuring a more reliable supply of low-carbon ammonia and low-carbon hydrogen products,"" even in the event ""the offsite carbon capture operation is unavailable.""

""The 25 percent would be the maximum downtime allowed under the new permit for the carbon sequestration operation,"" said Christina Stephens, the company spokeswoman. ""Our intention is to operate the facility with carbon capture operational to the maximum extent possible, capturing 95 percent of our emissions.""

She added the changes would ""also account for the possibility that various aspects of the facility may start up on slightly different schedules.""

Greg Upton, executive director of the LSU Center for Energy Studies, said he could not comment directly on Air Products, but said such companies often see economic value in ensuring options remain available.

""These large capital investments are made spanning decades, and so because there's uncertainty over lots of factors, companies think of what's called a 'real option.' And a 'real option' is simply the following: I'm going to build into my capital plans the ability to do things in the future, even if I might or might not exercise that option,"" he said.

Air Products juggles options

Despite industry enthusiasm for carbon capture and scientific backing of its safety, the concept has faced resistance from landowners, residents and local leaders.

For Air Products' plans, a mix of environmentalists, Lake Maurepas fishermen and crabbers, residents, legislators and some parish council members have opposed the project for safety, aesthetic and environmental reasons. Those include the visual impact of platforms and well sites on the lake's surface, lake-bottom dredging, wetlands destruction and what they see as groundwater threats.

The company and industry advocates say they are the victims of misinformation, defending carbon capture as safe and effective, with minimal disruption to Lake Maurepas and no real threat to drinking water sources because of the depth of the wells.

In a recent hearing for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and state coastal permits, local legislators called for an extensive environmental analysis that would include not only Air Products' plans but also the cumulative impact of other carbon capture projects in the region. The work could take two years.

These officials also pointed to recent Southeastern Louisiana University research showing that lake waters have heavy metal contamination that's likely also in lake sediments. They said that could be stirred up by dredging for the underwater pipeline network.

On land, the lines would also destroy a few hundred acres of high-value cypress and tupelo swamps in the Maurepas Wildlife Management Area.

The company says it has taken steps to minimize the impact of the well and pipeline network through the use of the same right of way for multiple lines and with a curtain to limit the spread of dredged sediments.

Gov. Jeff Landry has also instituted a temporary moratorium on new underground carbon injection permit applications to prioritize a review of existing applications. Six projects were fast-tracked under the order, but Air Products' permit wasn't one of them.

Earthjustice senior attorney Lauren Godshall noted that Air Products is having to ""passionately defend the project"" amid these headwinds, while also looking to sell off pieces of the complex. She added that ""it feels like cheating, in a way, to promise blue/clean energy"" and then pursue an air permit that would allow options for so much CO2 emission.

In a Nov. 6 earnings call, Air Products CEO Eduardo Menezes said a permit with the ability to emit CO2 is a key to negotiations to find partners for the carbon capture and ammonia pieces of the complex.

The company's ""potential counterparts asked us to have the flexibility of running the plant on a gray mode if something happens with the CO2 sequestration that we did not expect to do or still do not expect to do because the CO2 is a big contributor for the project,"" Menezes said.

""Gray mode"" means emitting waste carbon dioxide into the air.

Public storage on the block too?

In a October 2021 deal with the state, Air Products gained exclusive rights to nearly 122,500 acres of underground storage beneath Lake Maurepas, the nearby Maurepas Swamp Wildlife Management Area in St. James Parish and Lake Sabine in Cameron Parish.

Patrick Courreges, a spokesman for the state Department of Conservation and Energy, said no company has approached the department or the Mineral Board about such a transfer. A key concern for the state will be who pays what's owed under the deal and who will be responsible if a problem occurs.

""Such transfers have been relatively routine for decades,"" he said.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/nola.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/4/2b/42baac65-830a-50ad-82ae-952fefb515f7/691ca9d701a1e.image.jpg?crop=1143%2C601%2C0%2C79,N,,2025-12-01 14:03:30.454458

The Stakes for Imperial County’s Future Despite the report’s warnings, regional leaders say Lithium Valley’s promise is real and achievable if the right choices are made early.
CCV Executive Director Luis Olmedo said the path forward must be guided by the people who call Imperial County home.","BRAWLEY — The future of Lithium Valley could either lift Imperial County into a new era of prosperity or repeat decades of broken promises, according to a sweeping new 129-page workforce analysis released this week by Comité Cívico del Valle (CCV) and the University of California San Diego Labor Center.

Imperial County, home to the highest poverty and unemployment rates in California, sits atop one of North America’s largest lithium brine deposits. With global demand for domestically sourced lithium surging, researchers argue that the region is standing at a defining crossroads: embrace “high-road development” that delivers family-supporting wages, safe working conditions, and real career pathways for local residents, or slide into “low-road development” dominated by external interests, low wages, and minimal community benefit.

The report frames Lithium Valley as a once-in-a-generation chance to reverse historic economic inequities. Despite a young and growing bilingual workforce, most Imperial County residents lack access to the kind of education, transportation, childcare, and job information systems necessary to compete for high-quality careers in the clean-energy sector. Many interviewees, 214 adults surveyed across the county, reported deep skepticism, citing decades of outside industries bypassing local workers in favor of non-local hires.

Researchers emphasize that the stakes are unusually high for Imperial County because the region is projected to experience a rare workforce boom over the next several decades, even as the working-age population across the rest of California declines. According to demographic modeling included in the report, thousands of young residents will be entering the labor market just as lithium extraction, geothermal power expansion, and battery manufacturing could scale up. This convergence of workforce growth and industrial investment presents an opening that many rural counties lack, making the timing of policy choices especially urgent.

At the same time, the report points out that Imperial County’s current industrial structure remains heavily concentrated in low-wage, high-risk sectors such as agriculture, retail, fast food, and personal care. These jobs, while essential to the region’s economy, do not provide the family-supporting wages or long-term career ladders needed to stabilize households. By contrast, the projected occupations tied to Lithium Valley — particularly in battery manufacturing — offer substantially higher median wages and far more stability. The question, researchers note, is whether local workers will have the training and support systems necessary to actually access these roles when they arrive.

At the same time, researchers emphasize the scale of potential opportunity. Depending on how fully the lithium battery supply chain takes root in the region, Lithium Valley could create anywhere from several hundred to more than 4,000 high-road jobs, most of them in manufacturing rather than extraction. Battery production presents the largest economic boost — but also demands the most significant expansion of local training capacity, apprenticeship programs, and industry-education partnerships.

To meet future workforce needs, CCV and UCSD highlight the urgency of building a coordinated training ecosystem. Nearly 75 to 85 percent of the projected high-road occupations require apprenticeships or specialized certificates, yet Imperial County’s existing workforce system is too small to meet that level of demand. Without long-term collaborations among employers, unions, community groups, and training providers, the county risks watching high-wage jobs pass local residents by.

A Region Positioned for Opportunity, But Only If Barriers Are Removed

The report stresses that the county’s demographic strengths — its young workforce, bilingual population, and steady supply of upcoming high school graduates — position Imperial County to play a central role in California’s clean-energy future. But deep structural barriers continue to limit access to high-road employment.

Interviewees described consistent challenges with finding job-relevant training close to home, securing adequate English-language instruction, accessing reliable transportation, and affording childcare. Many also voiced longstanding mistrust toward incoming industries after years of low-wage, unstable work that historically favored non-local workers.

These obstacles, researchers argue, are systemic, not personal, and must be addressed through policy changes, investments, and enforceable commitments from companies entering the region.

High-Road vs. Low-Road Development: A Clear Fork in the Road

According to the report, Imperial County’s future hinges on which development path regional partners choose.

High-road development centers on accessible career pathways, family-supporting wages, and meaningful worker voice. Low-road development, by contrast, mirrors global patterns of exploitation, in which companies extract resources while providing minimal benefits to workers or the surrounding communities. Examples in lithium mining regions abroad and at domestic battery plants illustrate what happens when industries prioritize cost-cutting over community benefit.

The authors lay out a comprehensive strategy to ensure the lithium boom benefits Imperial County residents.

They call for expanding training and apprenticeships, improving transportation between cities and the geothermal resource area, and increasing childcare access so workers with caregiving responsibilities can enter and stay in the workforce. They also stress the importance of establishing Community Benefits Agreements to enforce transparency in local hiring and to guarantee that residents participate fully in lithium-related careers.

Finally, they argue that employers, training providers, unions, and community organizations must form long-term partnerships capable of sustaining these commitments through decades of economic growth and industry change.

The Stakes for Imperial County’s Future

Despite the report’s warnings, regional leaders say Lithium Valley’s promise is real and achievable if the right choices are made early. CCV Executive Director Luis Olmedo said the path forward must be guided by the people who call Imperial County home.

Leila Banijamali is the CEO of permitting software company Symbium and Zachary Millimet is a senior policy advisor to the company.

With federal climate incentives and renewable energy programs facing unprecedented rollbacks, state legislatures have become the last line of defense for clean energy deployment. Surging load growth and the cost of electricity is rising faster than the rate of inflation, and state policy must be laser focused on reducing barriers to deployment and driving down permitting costs.

Right now, several states are considering automated permitting bills that could either accelerate the clean energy transition or lock in years of bureaucratic gridlock and stifled innovation. These bills need to pass, but only if they’re designed correctly. The difference between success and failure hinges on a single critical design choice: whether states mandate specific technology platforms or establish technology-agnostic standards that foster competition and innovation.

The stakes couldn’t be higher, and the lessons from past mistakes are unambiguous. Consider this cautionary tale: California’s SB379 governing residential solar energy system permitting was signed into law in September 2022. The landmark law requires jurisdictions to adopt a permitting platform that accelerates the approvals of certain residential solar permits.

But rather than codifying transparent, objective standards, SB379 mandated the use of a rather limited privately run program called SolarAPP+ or any alternative platform that is capable of issuing permits for certain solar and energy storage systems “that SolarAPP+ is capable of processing,” effectively blessing one solution. This would be equivalent to the government requiring consumers to purchase a particular brand of electric vehicle, EV1, or another car that is defined by EV1’s obscure feature set. By obscuring choice, we stifle innovation and limit the ability of these programs to scale in a meaningful way.

At the time SB379 was passed into law, SolarAPP+ was inapplicable for use in about 60% of all residential solar projects in California. Consequently, it has failed to gain traction in many jurisdictions, with building departments struggling to make it work. What’s worse, this legislation set a precedent for enshrining one technology that was repeated in other states like Maryland, Minnesota, Illinois and New Jersey. Fortunately, states like Texas and Florida have rejected that approach and have opted for technology-agnostic automated permitting laws instead.

The urgent need for technology-neutral state action

In an era marked by the dismantling of federal clean energy incentives and programs, state-level policy has become the critical battlefield for climate progress. Without federal action to streamline permitting or support renewable deployment, states must move quickly — and smartly — to advance automated permitting legislation that can accelerate the clean energy transition. The urgency is unprecedented, and the window for effective state intervention is small.

The imperative is clear: States need to pass technology-agnostic automated permitting bills immediately. Unlike California and Maryland’s approach of mandating specific platforms like SolarAPP+, the new generation of legislation must establish clear, objective standards that any qualified technology provider or building department can meet. This approach doesn’t just avoid picking winners; it creates the competitive environment necessary for rapid innovation and cost reduction at precisely the moment when federal support has evaporated.

So, what can we learn from legislators in Texas and Florida? Rather than bless a specific solution enshrined in state legislation, it is abundantly clear that, if we are to spur innovation and market competition in the absence of federal leadership, states should establish clear goals (i.e., instant permitting) and disclose a circumscribed set of the codes and standards that must be processed to inject more competition into the development and deployment of instant permitting solutions that are directly responsive to the nuanced needs of local jurisdictions and large- or small-scale installers. The goals are to foster innovation, lower costs and produce superior outcomes for governments and the public alike, not to enshrine one player’s set of features.

The urgency of this moment cannot be overstated. With federal programs in retreat, state legislatures have a narrow window to establish the regulatory infrastructure that will either enable or constrain clean energy deployment for the next decade. Technology-agnostic automated permitting bills represent one of the most impactful policy levers available to states right now — streamlining the process for solar, storage, heat pumps, EV chargers and other electrification technologies without the massive price tag of direct subsidies.

The choice is clear: We can either deploy systems that are revolutionizing the permitting experience and serving the public interest through open competition and innovation, or we can hand over the resolution of critical government functions and regulatory bottlenecks — effectively, the hardest problems to solve — to favored private actors. The latter stifles progress, inflates costs and erodes the essential trust between private entities and local governments that real progress demands. The next generation of clean energy and housing development depends on getting this right, and there are precious few opportunities to fix a rigged system once it’s locked in place.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/JDmLgpHppJdMWE2ZQ7AGjXjICiGYgMO5FqkObCuskEs/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9yb29mdG9wX3NvbGFyX0NhbGlmb3JuaWEuanBn.webp,N,,2025-12-01 14:01:31.634146

(P&GJ) — Louisiana’s Office of Coastal Management (OCM) has formally reissued the coastal use permit for the Commonwealth LNG export facility in Cameron Parish, clearing the project to move forward following an extensive reassessment of its environmental and community impacts.

The updated decision—issued Nov. 18, 2025, as part of OCM’s Revised Basis of Decision—follows a state court order vacating the previous permit over insufficient review of climate and cumulative impacts. The new analysis concluded that “the project’s social and economic benefits outweigh environmental costs” and that the permitting process satisfied federal environmental justice standards.

According to the report, regulators reviewed environmental justice (EJ) impacts as outlined in the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s (FERC) Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS), which identified potential effects on wetlands, social patterns, fishing industries, and storm-surge protection in nearby communities.

The decision states that “the public’s contribution has influenced the permitting authority’s decision” and that community concerns were incorporated into the review process. OCM wrote that it sought to ensure no group “bears a disproportionate share of negative environmental consequences resulting from the permitted activities due to race, color, national origin, or income.”

The updated permit includes specific conditions for managing stormwater discharge, protecting wetlands, and monitoring endangered species. OCM confirmed it accepted FERC’s assessment that the project would “likely adversely affect” the Eastern Black Rail, but that impacts were not expected to jeopardize the species’ survival. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s Biological Opinion supported that conclusion.

The permit also mandates that Commonwealth operate a Water Control Structure (WCS) under a state-monitored adaptive management plan. The company must report marsh hydrology data—including salinity, tidal range, and water elevation—every six months for the first two years of operation. If monitoring indicates damage to local wetlands, OCM can require remediation.

The decision found the project provides “direct benefits to communities in Cameron and Calcasieu parishes,” citing construction employment, long-term operations jobs, and tax revenue. Commonwealth LNG estimates 800 workers per month during construction, peaking at 2,000, with an additional 3,689 secondary jobs supported in the region. The company expects to distribute $234 million in payroll over the 36–38 month construction period, with Louisiana collecting more than $2 million in state sales tax.

The permit requires compliance with air, water, and waste regulations, coordination with cultural and wildlife agencies, and stipulates that all project structures must be removed within 120 days of abandonment. Pipelines must maintain at least three feet of cover below water crossings, and any maintenance that affects that depth will require a new permit.

With the revised permit reinstated, Commonwealth LNG may proceed toward construction pending final regulatory clearances. The project represents one of several LNG export facilities planned along Louisiana’s Gulf Coast, underscoring the region’s growing role in global natural gas supply and carbon management.",https://pgjonline.com/media/5071/courthouse-social.jpg?v=1dc1b245f8b2780,N,,2025-12-01 13:02:42.258657

Maine Conservation Voters Action Fund announced its support for the Democrat at a news conference Monday in Portland. The political action committee picked Pingree for the June 9 primary from a crowded field of big name Democrats because of her work related to climate change and transitioning to clean energy.

Though the organization works to elect “climate and environmental champions” to serve as state legislators and governor, this is the first time it has made an endorsement in a gubernatorial primary.

“Maine needs a governor who has the courage to stand up to President Trump, and the savvy to win when she does. We need a governor who can build lasting coalitions and bring people together, but who will never compromise on her values and will fight for Maine’s people and communities,” said Maureen Drouin, executive director of Maine Conservation Voters.

So far in the president’s second term, the Trump administration has enacted a sweeping agenda to roll back environmental regulations, including on coal-fired power plants, water pollution, vehicle emissions and more. The administration has also sought to downplay the impact of global warming, such as with an executive order to remove signs throughout the nation’s national parks that explained how climate change was contributing to changing landscapes and what steps visitors could take to reduce their carbon emissions.

In light of that federal posture, the group highlighted Pingree’s current and former work in Maine to protect natural resources and public health. The speakers at the news conference Monday specifically mentioned legislation she sponsored as a state representative in 2008 to reduce children’s exposure to concerning chemicals, as well as a 2007 bill she led to ban toxic chemical flame retardants.

Pingree’s more recent work as part of the administration of Gov. Janet Mills also helped win her the favor of Maine Conservation Voters. As co-chair of the Maine Climate Council, she helped develop the state’s climate action plan. Through that work, the state created a storm recovery fund and programs to protect working waterfronts and other critical infrastructure from climate catastrophes.

Pingree, who said she was honored to earn this endorsement, said that she would continue to fight on behalf of Maine’s people and environment if elected governor. She noted that she’s spent most of her life living in the island town of North Haven, including the time she served in the Maine House “representing my neighbors who make a living on the ocean where a clean environment is tied to livelihoods and the future of our communities.”

From 2019 to earlier this year, Pingree served as director of Maine’s Office of Policy Innovation and the Future, where she worked to make the state more resilient against extreme weather and led initiatives to help people lower their energy costs and transition their homes from fossil fuels to heat pumps.

The SEWD text and report contain several notable provisions regarding DOE funding programs and propose less aggressive cuts to clean energy programming than both the HEWD FY 2026 bill and the president's FY 2026 Budget Request.
The SEWD bill also requires DOE to ""apply the indirect cost rate to the same extent and in the same manner as was applied in fiscal year 2024.""
The administration requested $750 million in additional credit subsidy through its FY 2026 budget request to support financing of small modular reactors and advanced nuclear reactors.

The U.S. Senate Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development Appropriations (SEWD) released a bill and corresponding report on Nov. 24, 2025, to fund the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and U.S. Bureau of Reclamation for fiscal year (FY) 2026. The bill was posted by the majority, as the committee was unable to come to a bipartisan agreement allowing it to move forward with a markup. SEWD Chair John Kennedy (R-LA) released a statement noting that his bill ""would result in a 1.1% reduction in spending for the Appropriations Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development, making it the only FY 2026 Senate appropriations bill so far that cuts spending.""

Note: In September, the Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives passed its own FY 2026 Appropriations Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies (HEWD) bill without any Democratic support.

Sen. Patty Murray (D-WA), Ranking Member of both SEWD and the full Senate Appropriations Committee, expressed some concerns with the bill, especially its cuts to energy programs. However, she also acknowledged its inclusion of ""important priorities [she] strongly advocated for,"" including 11 earmarks for Washington state, and committed to engaging in negotiations to bring the bill closer to passage. Some Democratic support will be needed as 60 votes are required to advance appropriations bills in the Senate.

The SEWD text and report contain several notable provisions regarding DOE funding programs and propose less aggressive cuts to clean energy programming than both the HEWD FY 2026 bill and the president's FY 2026 Budget Request. Also of note, both chambers' appropriations bills align with the previous DOE organization and leadership structure and do not yet reflect the newly released organization structure. More information about the reorganization is available in a previous Holland & Knight blog post.

Highlights and Notable Language

Grant Termination Guardrails and Indirect Cost Rates

SEWD's bill requires DOE to notify both HEWD and SEWD at least 120 days prior to the effective date of any grant termination. Of those 120 days, no fewer than 90 days shall be provided to work with grantees to restructure or rescope the award to better effectuate program goals or agency priorities. While restructuring or rescoping, recipients shall continue to be reimbursed for work done under the award. If there is no ability to restructure or rescope and, thus, the award is terminated, the bill states that DOE should prioritize those recipients if they apply to a future funding opportunity for the relevant program.

These policies would apply to projects funded by previous appropriations bills and appropriations provided by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA). They exclude Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) funding and awards announced after Nov. 1, 2024.

The SEWD bill also requires DOE to ""apply the indirect cost rate to the same extent and in the same manner as was applied in fiscal year 2024."" This provision follows DOE initiatives earlier this year to cap the indirect cost rate for FY 2025 awards to institutions of higher education and in certain state government programs, including the State Energy Program (SEP) and Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP).

Reprogramming of Previous Funding

The bill text reprograms unobligated funds from several IIJA provisions to other DOE initiatives or program budgets for FY 2026, including:

$1.059 billion of unobligated funds from the Regional Direct Air Capture (DAC) Hub Program to the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), now under the new Office of Critical Minerals and Energy Innovation (CMEI)

$1.5 billion in unobligated funds from the Carbon Dioxide Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Program (CIFIA), plus $900 million in unobligated Office of Nuclear Energy (NE) funds, to be reallocated to NE for the Advanced Nuclear Reactor Demonstrations Program (ARDP)

$92.35 million of unobligated funds from the Regional Clean Hydrogen Hubs Program (H2Hubs) to NE

$92.35 million of unobligated funds from H2Hubs to Fossil Energy (FE), under the new Hydrocarbons and Geothermal Energy Office (HGEO)

$75 million of unobligated funds from H2Hubs to Grid Deployment, now primarily under the Office of Electricity (OE), for programming to enhance the domestic supply chain for grid components

Loan Programs

The Loan Programs Office (LPO), now under the Office of Energy Dominance Financing (EDF), has significant loan authority under the Title 17 loan guarantee program from the IRA and $1 billion in credit subsidy in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBB). The administration requested $750 million in additional credit subsidy through its FY 2026 budget request to support financing of small modular reactors and advanced nuclear reactors. SEWD's bill does not provide that credit subsidy, and in its report language, the committee calls on DOE to use Title 17 authority ""to support critical minerals development, processing and recycling projects.""

Also within EDF's purview, SEWD's bill does not include the administration's request to rescind unobligated credit subsidy for the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing (AVTM) Loan Program, while continuing to support the Tribal Energy Financing (TEFP) Program as well.

Additional Highlights

For the first time, the SEWD bill recommends establishing the Manufacturing and Energy Supply Chains Office (MESC) and proposes a funding level of $19 million, primarily for workforce capacity and competitiveness.

The Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations (OCED) was also dissolved during DOE's realignment. Despite the office's statutory authorization, an identical recommendation across SEWD, HEWD and the White House budget request is to provide zero funding to OCED for FY 2026. As outlined above, SEWD recommends reprogramming some of OCED's unobligated balances.

SEWD makes clear its support for the CarbonSAFE program. In its report, the committee directs DOE to issue funding opportunities with remaining IIJA funds for CarbonSAFE projects and continue advancing projects through the program's four phases.

The more than $100 million in congressionally directed spending (also known as earmarks) in the report funds a broadly bipartisan set of projects, indicating further potential for Democratic support of the package.

A major solar panel manufacturer is transferring the assets of its Chinese unit to Canadian ownership, to safeguard sales into the U.S. as Washington steps up scrutiny of imports from the Asian nation.

CSI Solar Co., based in Suzhou, will sell 75.1 per cent of three overseas factories that serve the U.S. market to its parent company, Canadian Solar Inc., the Chinese company said in an exchange filing in Shanghai.

Canadian Solar, which is listed on the Nasdaq, was the world’s seventh-biggest producer of solar panels last year, according to BloombergNEF data, and was an early entrant into the booming energy storage business. It owns 62 per cent of CSI’s shares, and Shawn Qu is chairman of both companies.

CSI Solar shares closed down 6.9 per cent in Shanghai, while Canadian Solar rallied 18 per cent in U.S. premarket trading on Monday.

China’s dominance of the clean energy supply chain has prompted various forms of restrictions from the U.S. These include direct tariffs on Chinese solar panels and batteries, as well as restrictions on tax incentives for Chinese companies investing in the manufacturing of renewable power equipment in the U.S.

The Chinese company didn’t specify in the filing where the three factories whose ownership is being transferred are located. However, it said they comprise a 3 gigawatt-hour energy storage system plant, a 2.9 gigawatt battery factory and an 8 gigawatt solar wafer slicing operation. The three facilities have a combined value of 469 million yuan (US$66 million) and primarily supply the U.S., it said.

The factories will be used to help start two joint ventures focused on solar power and energy storage in the U.S., according to the filing. Canadian Solar will own 75.1 per cent of the JVs, with CSI holding the remaining 24.9 per cent.

CSI is aiming “to address changes in U.S. market laws and regulations, ensure normal business operations, reduce operational risks, and achieve long-term participation in the U.S. market,” it said in the filing.

This move will enable CSI “to remain compliant with potential U.S. foreign entity of concern requirements” for solar and energy-storage systems exports to the U.S., Dennis Ip, an analyst at Daiwa Capital Markets, said in a note.

For the generation and energy storage side, this new entity will oversee both solar module and cell production, as well as the manufacturing and sales of its energy storage systems (ESS), branded as e-STORAGE.

Canadian Solar will hold a controlling 75.1% stake in CS PowerTech, along with acquiring “specific overseas facilities that support US operations,” effectively moving these critical assets out from under the purview of its majority-owned, China-listed subsidiary, CSI Solar, which is based in Suzhou. The transaction is valued at approximately $50 million, determined by “fair market value based on third-party appraisal”, said the release.

CSI will continue to own 24.9% of the CS PowerTech venture. In the press release and associated filings to the Nasdaq stock exchange, the “overseas facilities” were not specified.

Storage

On the battery front, the operational shift supports a sizeable storage portfolio of both product and development. Through its e-STORAGE subsidiary, Canadian Solar reported a $3.1 billion contracted backlog and an 81 GWh global development pipeline as of late 2025. The consolidation allows the company to integrate its manufacturing capabilities directly with its project development arm, Recurrent Energy.

“Launching CS PowerTech and resuming manufacturing directly under the publicly traded parent company reflects Canadian Solar’s commitment to its North American homebase and to building a resilient, transparent and diversified domestic supply chain,” said the company in its press release announcing the moves.

The transaction is subject to board and shareholder approvals. Canadian Solar also said “the company [is] eyeing further joint ventures with American partners to expand its solar and power footprint.”

FEOC/IRA Compliance

The restructuring appears calculated to address Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) guidelines. By transferring control to the Canadian-headquartered parent company and U.S. shareholders, the company positions its battery products to better align with the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).

It also avoids some scrutiny

Similar moves have been undertaken by Trina Solar, which sold its solar manufacturing assets in Dallas, Texas to T1 Energy (which was named Freyr Battery at the time).

Corning acquired JA Solar’s Phoenix solar facility as well, and, closing the circle, T1 Energy and Corning announced an at-scale supply deal within a month.

A slide from Canadian Solar’s most recent financial reporting presentation showed the company’s operations as follows, while noting its 6 GWh ESS facility in Shelbyville, Kentucky, in the US, is under construction.

What’s driving the oil surplus?

Oil demand growth is faltering. The trade policies of US President Donald Trump are weighing on the outlook for the global economy, and China, the second-largest crude consumer, is struggling with a property market downturn and weak consumer spending.

On the supply side, OPEC+, the coalition of producers led by Saudi Arabia, has been unwinding past output cuts. Countries outside this group, in particular those in the Americas, are churning out more barrels, too.

Supply from Russia, the world’s third-biggest producer, remains a wild card. On the one hand, the country faces new US sanctions that threaten to disrupt its exports. But the Trump administration’s renewed effort to secure a deal to end the war in Ukraine has raised the prospect of some international sanctions being unwound, which could ease the flow of Russian barrels into the market.

Who are the winners in a world with an oversupply of oil?

– Oil-importing nations

A low-oil price environment is good for buyers, especially large net importers such as China, which has been filling up its strategic reserves, and India, which has faced US pressure to stop buying Russian crude.

India is the world’s third-biggest consumer of oil. It ramped up its purchases from Russia following the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, as Russian exporters offered big discounts to offset the loss of traditional European buyers. A drop in global prices could make it less painful for India to avoid sanctioned Russian barrels and switch to suppliers in the Middle East, whose medium and heavy crude grades are similar to Russia’s Urals export blend.

– Trump

Cheaper oil can translate into lower fuel prices. Trump likes to use the price of gasoline as an economic barometer and during last year’s election pledged to bring it below $2 a gallon.

Just over 10 months into his second term, the national average price of gasoline had dropped by about 12 cents, although had yet to fall beneath $3 a gallon, a level last seen in 2021. Further reductions in fuel prices could be limited by outages at key oil refineries in Asia and Africa, as well as permanent closures across Europe and the US.

Note: Data as of Nov. 29, 2025

Lower oil prices come with a catch for Trump. If they decline too much, crude extraction could become uneconomical in the US, undermining the president’s “drill, baby, drill” agenda and squeezing his political supporters that rely on the oil industry.

– Oil refiners

Cheaper crude can boost the margins that refiners make from turning oil into products such as gasoline, diesel and jet fuel. In mid-November, US refiners’ margins hit their highest seasonal level since 2022.

As global refining capacity is relatively constrained, this limits how much extra oil can be processed and means refined product prices are likely to fall less steeply than for crude. Lower oil prices are therefore more beneficial for countries that import and refine crude themselves, rather than relying on inflows of refined products.

Note: WTI refers to West Texas Intermediate. Data is as of Dec. 1, 2025.

– Oil traders

In the run-up to the oil surplus, the “put skew” for the US oil benchmark West Texas Intermediate — a measure of how much more traders are willing to pay for bearish put options over bullish calls — reached its highest level in a month. That’s a sign speculators are geared up for a price drop.

Meanwhile, just before the US blacklisted Russian oil giants Rosneft PJSC and Lukoil PJSC in October, money managers were the least bullish on US crude on record, according to the most up-to-date investor positioning data, which was delayed by the government shutdown.

As futures prices finally reflect the somber outlook for the market, many investors see this as vindication of their longstanding bearish view. They point to two things as proof they’ve been on the right side of the trade all along: total US crude stockpiles (excluding the Strategic Petroleum Reserve) climbed to their highest level in five months in November, while the volume of crude aboard tankers at sea continues to hit fresh records, suggesting supply is outstripping demand.

Source: Vortexa

Note: Data is as of Nov. 28, 2025

– US strategic oil reserve

Low oil prices offer an opportunity for the US to replenish its store of emergency crude, which was only around 60% full as of mid-November. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve remains diminished after the Biden administration released supply into the market to try to tame the gasoline price spike that followed Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

Trump vowed during his inaugural address to fill the SPR “right to the top.” Taking advantage of low oil prices, the Energy Department awarded contracts worth almost $56 million in November to procure 900,000 barrels for this stockpile.

However, as part of Trump’s sweeping tax-and-spending law passed over the summer, Congress only appropriated $171 million for oil purchases for the SPR between 2025 and 2029 — a limit the government could hit very quickly. That sum equates to less than 3 million barrels at current prices, which is a far cry from the roughly 300 million barrels needed to bring the SPR to full capacity.

Who are the losers when there’s a global excess of oil?

– Petrostates

For fossil-fuel exporters whose economies are heavily dependent on the oil industry, subdued prices could weigh on their revenue and put pressure on their fiscal budgets.

Saudi Arabia, the world’s second-largest oil producer after the US, is seeking to diversify its economy through the Vision 2030 program. However, the massive investments being made in mega construction projects, such as the flagship Neom development, as well as other initiatives to build Red Sea tourism resorts, electric-vehicle factories and data centers, have arguably left it even more dependent on oil revenue.

While the kingdom has been rejigging its mega-project spending — delaying and scaling back some developments and accelerating others — it’s still expecting a national budget shortfall for the next few years. Bloomberg Economics estimated in November that the Saudi government needs an oil price of $98 a barrel to balance its budget and $115 when including domestic spending by its sovereign wealth fund, the Public Investment Fund. That’s well above this year’s average of $69 a barrel for Brent, the global benchmark, through the start of December.

– Russia

Western sanctions have made Russian oil exporters heavily dependent on buyers in China and India, who have demanded discounts to keep importing this seaborne crude. In the absence of a peace deal to end the war in Ukraine, the new US sanctions and an oversupplied global market could force Russian producers to cut their prices even further.

As the US ban on dealings with Rosneft and Lukoil started to come into force in November, Russia’s flagship Urals blend was more than $20 a barrel cheaper than Brent, according to data from Argus Media. While that gap is significantly smaller than in the earlier years of the war in Ukraine, it’s still markedly wider than the historical discount of $2 to $4.

Source: Argus Media Ltd, Bloomberg

Note: Data is through Nov. 21, 2025

Taxes from Russia’s oil and gas industry account for about a quarter of the federal budget. Even before the new sanctions were announced, the government expected tax revenue from the sector this year to drop to the lowest level since 2020 due to the global crude price slump and a stronger ruble.

Russian authorities have downplayed the potential economic impact of the fresh US restrictions, saying the country will adapt quickly and find workarounds, allowing discounts on its oil to narrow within a couple of months. In the meantime, the volume of Russian oil aboard tankers has increased, suggesting that buyers are, at least in the short term, less willing to take delivery of these cargoes.

– US shale industry

The US shale industry has been the world’s engine for oil-production growth in recent years but the momentum is now slowing. Many producers need an oil price of around $65 a barrel to turn a profit and have been looking to increase their output at less than 5% annually as crude prices hover near the break-even threshold.

A global oil surplus that knocks prices down to about $50 a barrel would prompt US shale producers to idle their drilling rigs and park their frack fleets as operations become economically unviable.

Their output is holding up for now, but more than 10% of oil-focused rigs have been taken offline since the start of the year, according to data from Baker Hughes Co. The decline will likely accelerate in the coming months if oil prices stay low, which could put pressure on oilfield services companies.

Sustained lower oil prices could prompt more consolidation in the US shale patch. Mid-sized producers could scoop up struggling smaller players to add scale as some of the best drilling spots have already been tapped.

– Big Oil

Low oil prices are bad for producers, although integrated oil majors with refining and trading businesses are less vulnerable than pure upstream companies that focus only on extraction.

The profits of the five Western oil supermajors — Exxon Mobil Corp., Chevron Corp., Shell Plc, TotalEnergies SE and BP Plc — have more than halved from three years ago and are poised to decline further. Still, the current oil price downturn isn’t as bad as in 2014 or 2020. Big Oil executives saw this decline coming and announced plans to cut share buybacks and costs earlier this year.

Some executives are even talking up possible opportunities. Exxon, for example, is on the lookout for potential acquisitions. Meanwhile, Occidental Petroleum Corp. Chief Executive Officer Vicki Hollub said in mid-October that low prices today will deter the investments needed for the future and tighten supply, making her “very bullish” on a price rebound from 2027.

– The energy transition

Road transport is the biggest source of oil demand. Consumers are used to a certain amount of volatility in fuel prices, but a prolonged reduction could make them less inclined to switch to an electric vehicle. That said, in areas where there are high taxes on diesel and gasoline, such as Europe and California, there could be limited relief at the pump from lower oil prices.

The buildout of clean power sources is less likely to be impacted by a crude surplus. In most regions, other than places such as the Middle East, renewables are usually competing against coal and natural gas for utility-scale electricity generation rather than oil.

What makes the project remarkable isn’t just its scope, but that Reisdorf created it as an undergraduate from concept to launch.
“I was just a freshman taking Dr. Ben Wu’s Fundamentals of Ecology course, and I needed a small honors project.
Over the next three years, Reisdorf’s project grew into an international effort that has drawn more than 900 volunteers and produced over 70,000 classifications of bird sounds since launching publicly in June.
Students pitch in during spare moments, retirees have taken part from home and bird enthusiasts from around the world are contributing data to the Texas study.","When Texas A&M University freshman Carmen Reisdorf ’27 walked into her Fundamentals of Ecology class, she expected to learn about ecosystems — not launch a research project connecting hundreds of people around the world.

Reisdorf, a student in the Department of Ecology and Conservation Biology in the Texas A&M College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, built an online citizen science project hosted through Zooniverse, a global citizen science platform where anyone can help scientists analyze data. Her project asks volunteers to identify bird calls from the Edwards Plateau, helping researchers understand how land management practices affect wildlife.

What makes the project remarkable isn’t just its scope, but that Reisdorf created it as an undergraduate from concept to launch.

“It started as a class project,” she said. “I was just a freshman taking Dr. Ben Wu’s Fundamentals of Ecology course, and I needed a small honors project. I walked into his office on a Thursday afternoon and asked if there was something I could do to help with his research. He said, ‘Let’s see what happens.’”

What resulted from that conversation was more than expected. Over the next three years, Reisdorf’s project grew into an international effort that has drawn more than 900 volunteers and produced over 70,000 classifications of bird sounds since launching publicly in June.

“Even though our project features a specialized task, we’ve measured high volunteer accuracy rates so far,” Reisdorf said. “Because they work together to build consensus in our repeated-classifications approach, our volunteers don’t have to be bird experts to be a powerful voice in bird research.”

Turning sound into science

The idea stems from a larger United States Department of Agriculture-funded collaborative effort known as the Prairie Project, which studies rangeland restoration and sustainability across Texas, Oklahoma and Nebraska. Wu, Ph.D., professor in the Department of Ecology and Conservation Biology, serves as a co-primary investigator for the project and leads both the ranch-scale studies and its education component.

“Carmen’s work stands out as both excellent and innovative,” Wu said. “By combining AI and crowdsourcing through citizen science, she’s helping us explore how prescribed fire and grazing shape bird communities across savannah landscapes — something that wouldn’t be possible with traditional methods. Her project also enhances our teaching by giving undergraduates a hands-on way to practice scientific inquiry and critical thinking.”

At Texas A&M AgriLife Research’s Martin Ranch in the Edwards Plateau, researchers use 23 audio recorders to monitor bird activity at sunrise and sunset. Those recorders have produced more than 20,000 hours of audio since 2022, far too much for one student to review manually.

“I realized it wasn’t realistic to listen to every minute of every recording,” Reisdorf said. “I looked for ways to combine technology with community involvement.”

She used BirdNET, an open-source artificial intelligence, AI, model created by the Cornell Lab of Ornithology and Chemnitz University of Technology, to generate initial predictions of which bird species were present. The AI is powerful but imperfect as it can sometimes misidentify sounds, so Reisdorf designed a way for human volunteers to verify its results.

Through her Zooniverse project, titled “Savanna Spy: Sound,” users listen to short clips and confirm or reject the AI predictions. Each sound is reviewed by 15 people, allowing researchers to build consensus and refine the model’s accuracy.

“People are helping us separate true positives from false positives,” she said. “It’s a way to improve the data while teaching volunteers about birds, ecosystems and how sound can tell us what’s happening in the environment.”

Leading as a learner

For Reisdorf, the project has been as much about growth as research. A self-taught coder, she learned Python, R and HTML to manage and visualize her data. She also developed the communication skills to recruit volunteers and share her findings with academic and community audiences.

Since starting the project, she has presented her research at conferences, spoken to the local Audubon Society chapter and earned the College’s Dean’s Outstanding Award for Undergraduate Research.

“This project has pushed me to learn things I never thought I’d touch as an undergraduate,” she said. “It’s taught me that I should never be afraid to teach myself something new.”

She credits her success to the support of her mentors, especially Wu, who guided her through the process of turning a class idea into a full-scale study.

“Dr. Wu has been incredibly supportive,” she said. “He trusted me to take the lead and figure things out. I could not have brought it this far without his encouragement and his team’s help.”

Wu said Reisdorf’s independence and creativity stand out among undergraduate researchers.

“Carmen approached this work with the curiosity and drive of a graduate student,” he said. “She took an idea from concept to execution and built something that is making a real contribution to both science and education.”

Listening to the land

Reisdorf’s work helps scientists evaluate how birds respond to pyric herbivory, a land management practice that combines prescribed fire and grazing to restore savanna habitats. The approach aims to maintain open grasslands that support biodiversity and ranching alike.

“Birds are indicators of ecosystem health,” Reisdorf said. “By monitoring their sounds, we can learn how these habitats are changing and whether our management strategies are working.”

For Reisdorf, who grew up in Sharpstown in southwest Houston, the connection between people and nature has always been important to her.

“I grew up seeing this disconnect between people and the natural world,” she said. “That’s part of why I want to make science accessible. Projects like this help close that gap.”

She has already inspired others to join in. Students pitch in during spare moments, retirees have taken part from home and bird enthusiasts from around the world are contributing data to the Texas study.

“It’s humbling,” she said. “I see people worldwide helping us understand Texas ecosystems, and it reminds me that conservation is a shared responsibility.”

As she prepares to graduate early next year, Reisdorf plans to stay at Texas A&M to pursue a master’s degree and continue developing her research. She hopes to continue growing the project while keeping community participation at its heart.

“Technology can make research faster, but people keep it meaningful,” she said. “Every person who listens to a recording learns something about the environment, and that connection is what makes conservation a shared endeavor. When I go into the field and hear those same birds in person, I think about all the people who helped identify them in the Zooniverse project. It feels like we’re all listening together.”",https://media.agrilifetoday.tamu.edu/2025/11/20251114_Carmen_Reisdorf_HH-6.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 13:01:56.493575

It has been estimated that at least 16% of coal miners are affected, and in 2018, 1 in 5 coal miners in the central Appalachian region of the United States showed evidence of black lung.","In 2024, global demand for coal, often called “the world’s dirtiest fossil fuel”, reached a record high, consumption hitting approximately 8.8 billion tons.

Despite the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement, a legally binding international treaty aimed at limiting global warming to well below 2°C, and ideally 1.5°C, coal emissions continue to rise as part of the world’s stubborn reliance on fossil fuels. To have any chance of meeting the 1.5°C target, global greenhouse gas emissions need to peak before 2025 at the latest, and then decline by 43% by 2030. The catch? We are already in 2025. The clock is ticking.

One of the governments still pursuing coal, despite its environmental impacts, is the United States. On September 29th, 2025, the U.S. government revealed a plan to revive the mining of coal in the United States.

The U.S. Department of the Interior said it would open up 13.1 million acres of federal land for coal mining and lower royalty rates for companies needed to pay to extract coal. Meanwhile, the U.S. Department of Energy said it would invest $625 million to upgrade and expand the American coal industry.

These coordinated actions reflect a significant federal push to reinvigorate coal, despite environmental concerns and the ongoing global shift toward cleaner energy sources. The pursuit of coal is a giant step backwards in the fight against climate change, but there is still time to switch to clean energy alternatives.

Coal is Old

According to the US Energy Information Administration, coal production peaked in the United States in 2008 and has declined in output ever since. Output of coal is estimated to decline even further globally in 2026.

According to Global Energy Monitor, there are currently 2,457 coal-fired power plants worldwide, including both operating and mothballed units. To keep global warming below 1.5°C, as targeted by the Paris Climate Agreement, all these plants need to be retired by 2030 in wealthy countries and to meet the Paris Climate Agreement, the equivalent of about two coal plants must be retired per week by 2040.

Coal alone was responsible for approximately 15.4 billion tons of CO2 emissions in 2023, consistently producing more CO2 than any other fossil fuel annually. Despite this, only 12% of coal-fired power plants have been shut down, 11% require accelerated closure plans, and a staggering 77% have no scheduled phaseout or retirement commitment.

Coal is a finite resource with an estimated 134 years left until existing coal mines are considered depleted and when current consumption rates are factored in. Known oil reserves have approximately 51 years left to pump oil on present consumption levels.

But recent reports indicate that globally, there are over 850 new coal mine plans, expansions, and extensions in various stages of development, particularly concentrated in Asia-Pacific regions like China, India, and Australia. These new projects could add significant capacity to coal production, potentially extending the timeline of coal availability beyond current estimates.

So while coal is finite, exploration and new discoveries coupled with expanding mining capacity suggest more coal could still be accessible than previously counted.

Coal is Dirty

During the industrial revolution, coal soot filled the skies of industrial cities, lowering the life expectancy of workers and citizens alike. According to a 2023 joint study from Harvard University, George Mason University, and University of Texas at Austin, exposure to fine particulate matter from coal-fired power plants (coal PM2.5) is associated with a risk of mortality more than double that of exposure to PM2.5 from other sources.

Coal miners face even higher risks, both black lung disease and silicosis are commonly diagnosed in miners after years of inhaling coal dust. It has been estimated that at least 16% of coal miners are affected, and in 2018, 1 in 5 coal miners in the central Appalachian region of the United States showed evidence of black lung.

Particularly vulnerable are “young miners”, with an increase in lung diseases affecting miners in their 40s. There is no cure. Additionally, many coal miners suffer from mental health issues such as depression and suicidal thoughts, linked to poor working conditions and the physical toll of mining work. The combination of these health crises highlights ongoing occupational hazards faced by coal miners today.

Citizens around the world who use coal as a primary source of fuel also face health risks. Ulaanbaatar, the capital of Mongolia, is a prime example of this, where frigid winters require people to constantly heat their homes. For many citizens, coal is the only source of affordable fuel available to them.

On top of using coal in their home stoves, locally coal-fired power plants generate the overwhelming majority of the city’s electricity, about 93%. All of this reliance on coal creates smoky skies and rampant health issues. Lung diseases in the capital are common across all ages, while it has been found that Ulaanbaatar’s children have 40% lower lung function than children living in rural Mongolia.

Coal is Killing Wildlife

Coal poses significant environmental risks beyond its impact on human health. It contains toxic unburnable materials such as heavy metals, including lead, mercury, and arsenic, as well as radioactive elements like uranium, which remain concentrated in coal ash after combustion. This coal ash can contaminate ground and surface water.

Furthermore, coal mining often displaces local populations, destroys terrestrial habitats, and harms wildlife. Surface mining, in particular, causes large-scale land disturbance that alter topography, damage groundwater supplies, promote soil erosion, and reduce biodiversity.

Dump Coal

Globally, the highest demand for coal is concentrated in China, India, and Indonesia. With China alone accounting for more than half of the world’s coal production. Despite coal’s dominance, the energy transition is underway — with renewable energy surpassing coal for the first time to become the largest source of electricity generation worldwide. This shift demonstrates that while coal currently fuels much of the world, a cleaner, more sustainable energy future is achievable.

The United Kingdom, once defined by coal in the era of the industrial revolution, shuttered its last coal-fired power plant in 2024, making itself a coal-free nation for the first time in 142 years. 35 other countries have made similar moves, including Germany and South Korea.

Retired coal plants can be converted into renewable energy plants, as 3D models demonstrate. People power around the world has led a movement to end coal — activists like Jerry Curran, who through relentless activism, and with major public support, helped to close the Merrimack coal-fired power station in New Hampshire. The station was one of the most polluting power stations in the state and a single-point mercury polluter.

However, he is not the only one. In the last 14 years, communities across the United States have mobilized to retire 381 coal plants which has saved over 54,000 lives. It may take many, but when we unite, we have the power to make real change.

Alaska Beacon

Developers’ efforts to overturn the cancellation of a vast gold and copper mine planned for southwest Alaska are getting a boost from national mining and pro-business groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.

On Nov. 24 and Nov. 25, the Chamber and the National Mining Association filed separate friend-of-the-court briefs in the lawsuit brought by the developers of the proposed Pebble Mine against the Environmental Protection Agency, which vetoed the mine.

Neither group has intervened in the case against the EPA, but the briefs represent the groups’ support for the proposed mine and offer legal arguments that Judge Sharon Gleason could consider as she debates whether to move the project forward.

In 2023, the EPA invoked a rarely used “veto” clause of the Clean Water Act to say that there was no way that the proposed Pebble Mine could be developed without significant harm to the environment. The large mineral deposit is located at the headwaters of Bristol Bay, the most abundant sockeye salmon fishery in the world.

The administration of Gov. Mike Dunleavy, which supports the project, and the proposed mine’s developers, filed separate lawsuits in federal court to overturn the rejection, as did two Native corporations that work as contractors for the developers. Those cases have since been combined.

The U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear the case directly, which has left the issue in front of Judge Sharon Gleason in the U.S. District Court for the District of Alaska.

Another lawsuit filed by the state claims that if the veto is upheld, the federal government will owe Alaska $700 billion, the state’s estimate for the value of the mine if built as planned. That case has been put on hold until the District Court rules.

In July, the administration of President Donald Trump indicated that it might try to settle the suit and withdraw the veto. If that occurs, it could come before Jan. 2, when the EPA is slated to file a written response to the plaintiffs’ motions for summary judgment.

If the EPA continues to fight the case, the last written arguments are scheduled to be finished by the end of February. Any oral argument would take place afterward.

If the federal government drops the case, it doesn’t mean a free path for Pebble: Several environmental organizations, fishing groups, tribal organizations and Bristol Bay locals have also intervened in the case and intend to fight in court.

The Alaska Legislature is also expected to consider a bill that would block both Pebble and any successor projects that might emerge.

In its brief, the National Mining Association — joined by the American Exploration and Mining Association and the Alaska Miners Association — call the EPA’s veto “overly broad” and say that if it is upheld, the act “will almost certainly chill investment in domestic mining activities” because other proposed mines could also be subject to a veto.

The Chamber of Commerce, which has backed the Pebble Mine project since at least 2022, said that if the veto is upheld, it has the potential of encouraging other vetoes, which would “disrupt important industries in which many of the Chamber’s members participate.”

And on the federal level, Congressman Troy Balderson is trying to make Affordable, Reliable, Clean Energy Security the federal standard.
Energy production should be a kitchen-table issue, but with a longer lead time than the current election cycle.","A not-so-glowing attribute of American democracy is the ability of voters to act shocked and blame whoever is in charge when things don’t go well. So, it makes twisted sense that, as 2026 approaches, the Trump administration should pay the political price for bad energy policies inherited from the Biden administration and Democratic governors.

Years of flat energy demand and relatively stable electricity prices dulled Americans’ understanding of energy economics. Now, new data center demand, the end of cheap natural gas, and President Biden’s policy of replacing baseload nuclear and coal power with wind and solar have screwed up electricity price signals enough to shred household budgets and stun homeowners — just in time for a colder-than-average winter.

The numbers are as stark as a slate-grey November sky. Household spending on electricity for heating is expected to rise 10% this winter to more than $1,200. Utilities requested a $29 billion rate increase in the first half of 2025, double last year’s rate rise. Residential electricity rates rose 6.6% year-on-year as of June 2025, according to Utility Dive, after already rising nearly 30% between 2021 and 2024.

The causes of these electricity increases are multifaceted, yet, as a policy brief from the National Center for Energy Analytics reveals, subsidies to wind and solar are major culprits. Subsidies like the federal Production Tax Credit (PTC) distort electricity markets by artificially lowering prices, sometimes into negative territory, forcing otherwise competitive but unsubsidized generation out of the market.

Interestingly, the study found that the argument that increasing demand from the data center buildout is causing increases in average rates is not supported by the facts. The state of Virginia has built the large majority of data centers in the past 2 years, yet Virginia’s ratepayers have experienced below-average price gains and still pay below-average electricity rates.

The Big Beautiful Bill, passed by Congress in July, partially solved some of these market-signal problems by accelerating the phase-out of wind and solar projects to the end of 2027, but that fact can’t heat the homes of families making hard choices every day during the winter of 2025-26.

An extra hundred dollars a month over winter means no sports or academic camps in summer for teenagers. Fifty dollars a month can be the difference between seeking mental health counseling or fighting clinical depression alone. Energy prices don’t play games.

In places like Massachusetts and California where green-energy policy has gone too far, the pain is both real and self-inflicted, raising the question of why voters continue to elect Democrats who prefer self-actualization to public service.

Residential electricity prices in California rose 125% in the last 15 years as subsidies for renewables pushed out existing nuclear and natural gas, all with the support of their ravishing Governor, Gavin Newsom.

In Massachusetts, politicians like Governor Maura Healey show us that grown-ups can still be childish. She and other (nearly all Democrat) politicians in New England don’t want any new pipelines to ship natural gas from the super-cheap Marcellus Shale Formation in Pennsylvania, lest they offend climate-change sensibilities.

Instead, they imported LNG from 3,000 miles away in Norway, which averaged more than $12 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf) between January and March 2024. Meanwhile, average realized sales prices for Marcellus shale gas, less than 150 miles away during the same period, were between $2.10 and $2.20 per Mcf, only one-sixth the price. Not very smart.

As a result, both states, perhaps taking their cues from the grade-inflating Harvard and Stanford Universities within their borders, now have the highest electricity rates in the country, over 30 cents per kilowatt-hour. Nice job, Einsteins.

Leaving the energy policy equivalent of a flaming paper bag of poo on the front porch for the Trump administration to stomp out may be good politics for Democrat governors. Still, if the United States is going to win the future, we have to get away from the energy hunger games and put in place permanent policies that a subsequent White House occupant won’t overturned.

And some states do their energy policies better, and not just carbon rich states like Texas or Kentucky that have some geologic largesse. States like Indiana, which imports energy from other states, have slowed coalretirements through legislative action, passing laws requiring utilities to demonstrate grid reliability before replacing coal with renewables.

Even Democrat-run states like Illinois have resisted closing base load nuclear plants despite political pressure from net-zero and anti-nuclear groups.

And some states are doing even more. Republican governor Jeff Landry of Louisiana has signed sweeping legislation aimed at reducing energy costs and unleashing energy affordability to its rate payers across the states and countries that it feeds.

And on the federal level, Congressman Troy Balderson is trying to make Affordable, Reliable, Clean Energy Security the federal standard. If you want to set into law energy sanity that will survive, states need to follow leaders like Governor Landry. And if we as a country have any brains left in our screen-addled heads, we have to put Balderson’s ARC ES bill on the president's desk to sign.

Energy production should be a kitchen-table issue, but with a longer lead time than the current election cycle. We should be able to pay less to get more. The Trump administration is doing more in that regard than any administration in history. Opening Alaska, easing leasing restrictions on federal land, and cutting subsidies for EVs and renewables are nice. In the meantime, states and the federal government must step up.

OCOchem CEO Todd Brix likes to say that green chemistry runs in his family. His father, Terry Brix, was a green chemistry “serial entrepreneur” long before the phrase was common. Terry started 18 companies in Washington, all focused on creating sustainable chemicals from waste biomass. After earning a chemical engineering degree from the University of Washington, Todd went to work at Chevron Research and Technology Company, where he worked in oil refineries and dealt with early forms of green hydrogen.

Growing up in that environment, Todd recognized hydrogen’s potential as an awesome chemical with a variety of uses. But he also understood its biggest challenge: storing and transporting it safely, since it’s a highly explosive gas. That problem sparked his curiosity, and eventually his own research and development.

Todd spent six months digging through global research at the UW library, tracking down innovative processes, licensing intellectual property, assembling a team, and developing a business model in his Woodinville garage. The core invention was small-scale CO₂ electrolyzers — machines that convert carbon dioxide into a valuable chemical called formate.

In 2020, after completing their planning and prototype work, Todd and his father launched OCOchem. From there, Todd opened a full-scale lab, securing early funding, and expanded the vision that started in a garage.

The domino effect of early funding

That’s when the Department of Commerce stepped in. Early funding from Commerce’s Clean Energy Fund, a $1.5 million award that matched the U.S. Department of Energy’s Hydrogen EarthShot initiative, was pivotal. This initial boost drew additional support from U.S. Department of Energy and the Centralia Coal Transition Fund, as well as private investors from around the world.

Todd Brix stressed that without strong investment in research and development, true innovation just can’t happen. “I’m grateful to be in Washington state and have my state support me,” said Brix. “It certainly helped to advance this technology.”

From a lab to a large scale

By January 2024, OCOchem had built the world’s largest CO₂ electrolyzer cell, a 1.5-square-meter unit about the size of a dinner table. It works by using electricity to split water into hydrogen and oxygen on one side of the cell, then mixing the hydrogen with CO₂ on the other side to create formate, a process known as CO₂ electrolysis. The system started small in 2020 and was scaled up three times to reach its current size.

“Think of an electrolyzer like a kitchen appliance that works in reverse of a battery,” Brix explained. “A battery stores electricity and gives it back when you need it. A CO₂ electrolyzer uses electricity to take water apart into hydrogen and oxygen and then uses that hydrogen to combine with CO₂ to make formate in a single step.”

Doing this in one step means OCOchem doesn’t have to produce and store hydrogen gas separately or run it through high-temperature, high-pressure systems. That makes the process safer and less expensive. And because the formate is made from CO₂, releasing hydrogen from it later is carbon-neutral.

Impact on communities

OCOchem’s innovation could transform how we power vehicles, produce chemicals, and manage carbon emissions. Instead of releasing CO₂ into the air, OCOchem’s process makes it valuable to capture that resource, helping industries decarbonize, displacing products made from and by fossil fuels, while creating jobs and building new markets.

OCOchem is scaling up its technology to show how carbon emissions can be turned into solutions. Its principal research and development laboratories are in Richland, and in August 2025 the company announced a partnership with ADM to build a demonstration plant in Decatur, Illinois. The plant will turn 10,000 tons of CO₂ from ethanol production into formate each year, cutting emissions equal to taking about 16,000 cars off the road.

At the same time, OCOchem is developing portable “green” generators, which are quiet, nonpolluting alternatives to diesel engines that run on formate fuel and could power events, construction sites, and even food trucks.

Building the hydrogen economy

From garage experiments to global partnerships, OCOchem’s journey highlights the power of innovation in addressing climate change for Washington communities and beyond. With reformer technology on the horizon to produce hydrogen for vehicles, buildings and backup power, the company is positioning itself at the center of the hydrogen economy.

Brix is dedicated to transforming waste carbon dioxide into useful products and making green hydrogen easier to use. And he’s succeeding at flipping the incentives so society stops rewarding fossil fuel extraction and instead treats CO₂ as a resource for building a cleaner, more efficient future.

His family legacy in clean fuel is ongoing, too: Todd’s daughter is also a chemical engineer, picking up the knowledge of her father and grandfather and the things she learned watching them turn a family experiment in green chemistry into a technology powerhouse.",https://www.commerce.wa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/OCOchem.png,N,,2025-12-01 13:00:50.749552

Since 2020, the average electricity price per kilowatt-hour in the US has soared from $0.133 to $0.188, a 30% increase in just the past 5 years. In the next few years, many experts fear that the United States will face an electricity crisis (although one can argue it’s already in the early stages of one).

Image Source: FRED

Below are four factors driving higher energy prices:

· An Aging Electrical Grid: The US’s electrical grid is aging. With an already massive fiscal deficit, major grid upgrades are unlikely any time soon. Grid issues have become more prevalent recently and are likely to persist.

· Extreme Weather Events: Climate change has increased the frequency of extreme weather events over the past few years. For instance, a 2021 Texas winter storm left 2 million Texans without electricity.

· Persistent Inflation: Although the inflation rate has slowed since its 2022 peak, inflation is still driving up the costs of the equipment and materials needed to generate electricity.

· EVs & the AI Buildout: As electric vehicle adoption continues to grow, the need for charging infrastructure is also increasing. Meanwhile, the artificial intelligence buildout is the most significant driver of higher electricity prices. Currently, data centers comprise ~5% of total electricity use in the United States. However, McKinsey & Company expects that data center electricity use will triple by 2030, accounting for 11.7% of total consumption.

Is Nuclear the Solution to the US Electricity Crisis?

Chris Wright, the US Secretary of Energy, had a nuclear energy background prior to joining the Trump Administration, having previously served on the board of directors of Oklo (OKLO). With that in mind, it should be little surprise that the Trump Administration is pro-nuclear. Thursday, news broke that the US plans to buy and own as many as 10 nuclear reactors. Earlier this month, the Trump Administration also announced a $1 billion federal loan to restart the Three Mile Island nuclear plant that is managed by Constellation Energy (CEG).

But can nuclear energy solve US energy issues? Nuclear energy is one of the cleanest, most reliable, and cheapest forms of energy. However, nuclear energy is unlikely to be the solution to the US power woes in the short-to-intermediate-term because building a plant typically takes a decade. Additionally, nuclear energy companies face regulatory red tape, public opinion issues, and environmental concerns that are unlikely to be remedied any time soon.

Nuclear Stock to Buy: Constellation Energy (CEG)

Although the above-mentioned nuclear challenges hold for most nuclear projects in the United States, Constellation Energy is an exception. Constellation Energy is unique in the nuclear industry because it has already received regulatory approval and funding and has provided an estimate of when its massive nuclear project will launch. CEG’s restoration of the “Three Mile Island” nuclear plant in Pennsylvania, renamed the “Crane Energy Center,” will be online in 2027. Additionally, CEG has landed 20-year power agreements to supply electricity to two big tech juggernauts – Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta Platforms (META).

Natural Gas & Coal: Fueling the Early Innings of the AI Revolution

Although it’s reasonable for investors to believe that nuclear power will be a long-term power solution for the AI revolution, doing so now is unrealistic. Since the AI buildout is unlikely to slow down any time soon, traditional energy sources such as natural gas are the answer in the short-term due to their practicality and low cost.

Natural Gas Stock to Buy: Bloom Energy (BE)

Bloom Energy has differentiated itself from other energy providers through its solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) technology. BE’s technology takes natural gas (and other gases), mixes it with air, and creates electricity. However, unlike other natural gas providers, Bloom’s technology produces electricity without combustion, making its energy “cleaner”. Additionally, Bloom’s technology is self-sufficient and produced on-site, meaning that data center owners are not susceptible to grid outages.

Solar Energy: Another Solution for the AI Energy Glut

Now that solar energy is cheaper than ever, it is poised to be a major winner in the AI-driven energy demand boom. Solar is relatively cheap, clean, renewable, and can scale rapidly.

Solar Stocks to Buy: First Solar (FSLR) & Nextpower (NXT)

First Solar is a leading domestic solar provider. FSLR benefits from increasing solar demand. Additionally, the company benefits from the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which provides generous tax credits and shields it from Chinese competition. Wall Street analysts expect FSLR EPS to more than double next quarter.

Meanwhile, Nextpower is another company that will benefit from the electricity super-cycle. Nextpower’s software and services help solar projects run more efficiently.

Bottom Line

Electricity demand in the US is accelerating rapidly, and the early signs of a long-term power crisis are already visible. While nuclear offers a powerful long-term, solution, the urgency of the AI buildout means that natural gas, advanced fuel cell technology, and solar will drive the first wave of investment opportunities.

are not jurisdictional.” If you have additional questions on the new WOTUS rule, reach out to the NFIB Legal Center at info@nfib.org.","A newly proposed rule from the Trump Administration’s Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers aims to give landowners a more predictable definition of “waters of the United States” (WOTUS).

The definition of WOTUS has long been a point of contention for landowners. In past administrations, farmers, ranchers, home builders, and other small businesses with water on their property have faced overreach from the federal government, as it used WOTUS to claim jurisdiction over private lands.

Background

The Clean Water Act (CWA) gives the federal government authority over certain “navigable waters,” which the Act defines as “waters of the United States” or WOTUS. The CWA charges EPA and the Army Corps with enforcement, and these agencies have issued regulations defining which waters or wetlands are subject to federal jurisdiction. If a water or wetland is a WOTUS, then a landowner must obtain a permit before improving and altering the area, even though he or she owns the land.

After longstanding confusion and conflicting interpretations about what waters are WOTUS, the Supreme Court decided Sackett v. EPA in 2023. In Sackett, the Court struck down a vague test that the agencies had long used to claim jurisdiction. Thus, the Court restricted when the agencies could do so going forward. NFIB urged the Court to reach this outcome and applauded the decision benefiting landowners.

But the Biden Administration pushed forward. It responded to the Sackett decision by issuing a new WOTUS rule that further expanded federal government jurisdiction, leaving small businesses with extreme uncertainty. NFIB expressed disappointment that the federal government failed to head the Supreme Court’s mandate and continued to complicate WOTUS.

Newly Proposed Rule

On November 20, 2025, EPA and the Army Corps proposed a new WOTUS rule. Small businesses reacted to the new rule with appreciation and optimism for a better WOTUS future.

Among the changes in the new rule, a few will have a significant impact on small businesses and landowners.

Clearer Definitions

Relatively Permanent

In Sackett, the Supreme Court said that “waters” in WOTUS included “only those relatively permanent, standing or continuously flowing bodies of water forming geographical features’ that are described in ordinary parlance as streams, oceans, rivers, and lakes.”

The proposed rule defines relatively permanent waters as those that are “standing or continuously flowing bodies of surface water that are standing or continuously flowing year-round or at least during the wet season.”

Continuous Surface Connection

In Sackett, the Supreme Court said that wetlands are subject to the CWA and federal authority only if they are “adjacent” to a WOTUS, and the wetland has a “continuous surface connection” with that WOTUS, “making it difficult to determine where the ‘water’ ends and the ‘wetland’ begins.”

Under the proposed rule, a water with a “continuous surface connection” to a WOTUS means: 1) the water in question is abutting (touching) an already jurisdictional WOTUS, and 2) the water in question has surface water at least during the wet season.

“At least during the wet season” is a temporal requirement that will make it easier for a landowner or consultant to determine what areas satisfy the continuous surface connection test.

Restrictions of Wetland Jurisdiction

The proposed rule’s definition of “continuous surface connection” reduces the number of wetlands that will be jurisdictional and subject to federal authority.

Combined with the instructions of the Supreme Court in Sackett, the proposed rule’s definition of “continuous surface connection” will mean that a wetland is not jurisdictional unless it meets all three of these requirements:

The area in question meets the definition of a wetland; and

A “wetland” is defined as an area that is “inundated or saturated by surface or ground water at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation.” Examples are swamps, marshes, bogs, etc.

It is abutting (touching) that WOTUS; and

It has surface water at least during the wet season.

Unlike previous WOTUS rules, the proposed rule makes clear that only the portion of a wetland that satisfies the two-part continuous surface connection test will be a jurisdictional WOTUS. For example, if only one part of the wetland has surface water throughout the wet season, but other portions of the wetland do not, then EPA will split up the wetland for determining jurisdiction. This is a stark contrast to previous agency practices, which would include the entire wetland as jurisdictional if any portion of it was.

Exclusion of Most Ditches

Although ditches are generally excluded from the definition of WOTUS, previous administrations have treated the ditch exclusion differently so that many ditches would be jurisdictional.

To address and clarify this confusion, the proposed rule excludes all ditches “that are constructed or excavated entirely in dry land.”

The clarity of the proposed rule means that the jurisdictional reach of ditches will depend solely on where the specific ditch was constructed. Ditches constructed in wetlands or tributaries will still be jurisdictional, and in rare cases, a ditch constructed in dry land may meet an independent basis for federal jurisdiction, such as a ditch being navigable (like a canal) or qualifying as a “point source” for pollutant discharge. All other ditches should be excluded from WOTUS under the proposed rule.

Absolute Certainty on Ephemeral Waters

Ephemeral waters are those that are normally dry but may have surface or standing water flow temporarily only due to precipitation events like rain or snow fall.

The proposed rule makes clear that “ephemeral waters . . . are not jurisdictional.”

Regeneron Pharmaceuticals previously announced a $7 billion investment into its U.S. operations in North Carolina and New York, and one planned project is now taking off. Last week, New York Governor Kathy Hochul announced that the company would be investing $2 billion in Saratoga Springs, having acquired the site of Quad Graphics’ former magazine printing factory in April 2025. The over 1-million-sq.-ft. site will be reconstructed into a facility that will manufacture drugs for infectious diseases and cancer. “As Regeneron continues to drive forward our mission of using the power of science to bring forward life-changing medicines, we can improve the lives of those in New York and around the world,” said Regeneron CEO Leonard Schleifer. “In this pursuit, we look forward to continuing to fuel economic development and create meaningful, well-paying jobs that strengthen communities across the state.” The new facility, located just under three hours north of the company’s HQ in Tarrytown, is set to create 1,000 new jobs once operational. Empire State Development will support Regeneron’s project with up to $35 million in performance-based Excelsior Jobs Program tax credits.

Dive Brief:

Electric vehicle charging network operator Ionna plans to invest $250 million to expand public electric vehicle charging infrastructure in California over the next three years, the company announced in a Nov. 20 press release.

Ionna, the joint venture of eight major automakers, is currently building out an extensive EV charging network in the U.S. that customers of each OEM can use as a way to promote EV adoption, address the lack of convenient access to public chargers and facilitate long-distance, coast-to-coast travel, it says.

The company recently held kickoff ceremonies in California for its newly opened public chargers in San Francisco, Sacramento, San Diego, San Jose and Westminster, which Ionna says is only “a fraction” of the 1,000 charging bays it’s contracted to install across the state. Nationwide, Ionna plans to install up to 30,000 EV chargers by 2030.

Dive Insight:

Ionna was established in July 2023 as a joint venture between automakers BMW, General Motors, Honda, Hyundai, Kia, Mercedes-Benz, Stellantis and Toyota. In February, the company announced it was transitioning from its public beta phase to full-scale national rollout of its charging network.

Despite the Dept. of Transportation’s revised guidance for the distribution of federal funding to construct public EV charging infrastructure in the U.S., Ionna continues to expand its network. The company is not reliant on federal funds to construct its charging sites. Instead, its funding comes from private capital.

To promote the newly opened charging sites in California, Ionna launched an “EV Education Program” to teach new EV drivers about the benefits of electric mobility. Following the opening of each new location, Ionna ambassadors partner with local dealerships and EV groups to host an event at the site to demonstrate how easy it is to charge an EV at a Ionna-branded charger.

“This week’s expansion into California is a snapshot of the national momentum IONNA has built in under a year’s time,” said Seth Cutler, CEO of Ionna, in a statement. “‘IONNA Speed’ isn’t just about how quickly we grow, but also how we deliver, and the IONNA team consistently operates with a driver-first mentality to elevate the charging experience.”

Some flagship Ionna charging sites are referred to as “Rechargeries” and offer amenities such as food and drinks, restrooms and driver lounges to relax in.

Ionna is also rolling out “plug-in and charge” capabilities at its Rechargeries, allowing EV drivers to simply plug in and charge without needing a credit card for payment. Its chargers currently support plug-in and charge functionality for BMW, General Motors, Hyundai, Kia, Mercedes-Benz and more recently, Rivian and Ford EVs. Ionna’s plug-in and charge technology will roll out to Honda, Stellantis, Toyota EVs in 2026, per the release.

Last December, Ioanna announced a partnership with c-store operator Sheetz to install chargers at more than 50 of the retailer’s locations by the end of 2026, beginning with Florida.

In July, Ionna announced a new partnership with Pennsylvania-based convenience store chain Wawa, which increased its contracted EV charging hubs to over 3,000 at the time. With the planned California locations, Ionna’s now has over 4,000 EV charging bays contracted across the U.S.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/jOfxPy7qjMmdQg8EP3ADrfdcfpnuwW2KTTwCs_kI9vs/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9JT05OQS1BRUJwaG90b3MtMTItc2NhbGVkLmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-12-01 12:05:05.957999
,American Energy,2025-12-01 16:20:14+00:00,Utility Dive,Power plants in SPP can expand up to 20% under new FERC-approved fast-track review,"Ethan Howland, Robert Walton",,,,,https://www.utilitydive.com/news/ferc-spp-priority-process-power-plant-expansion/806630/,"SPP says that its “priority process” to add capacity at existing generating facilities will complement its FERC-approved Expedited Resource Adequacy Study process for new power plants to help meet near-term capacity needs.
Under the priority process, a power plant owner can seek to add up to 20% of a generating facility’s capacity at its existing interconnection point.
The American Clean Power Association and the Advanced Power Alliance — clean energy trade groups — supported the priority process proposal, saying it was narrowly tailored and non-discriminatory.
One would have allowed power plants that retired no more than five years ago to use the priority process to add capacity at those sites.
SPP also failed to adequately support its “queue priority” proposal, according to FERC.","This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback.

In a three-part decision, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission last week approved the Southwest Power Pool’s proposal allowing power plant owners to expand their generating facilities by up to 20% under a temporary priority review process.

However, FERC on Nov. 28 rejected SPP’s proposal to allow the owners of retired power plants to use the fast-track review process, as well as a proposal to give “priority projects” an advantage in an upcoming interconnection study process.

SPP’s proposals are part of a push by U.S. grid operators to create pathways for bringing power supplies online more quickly to meet rising demand for electricity. SPP contends it is onthe brink of a resource adequacy crisis, with its demand forecasts rising and power plant retirements accelerating, according to its “priority process” application at FERC.

Under the proposal, filed in late September, eligible shovel-ready expansion projects would receive an accelerated study process.

SPP says that its “priority process” to add capacity at existing generating facilities will complement its FERC-approved Expedited Resource Adequacy Study process for new power plants to help meet near-term capacity needs.

Under the priority process, a power plant owner can seek to add up to 20% of a generating facility’s capacity at its existing interconnection point. A power plant owner can use the process once per facility.

Priority project developers must meet eligibility requirements, including showing the project can be online within five years, that they have ordered all major equipment for their expansion project and that the manufacturer has indicated it can deliver the equipment by the planned commercial operation date. Also, all financing for the project must be secured.

Priority projects must also make heightened financial commitments compared to SPP’s standard financial requirements for interconnection requests.

The owners of priority projects must pay all of the cost of the Priority System Impact Study and all the cost of substation network upgrades and system network upgrades needed for their projects.

The American Clean Power Association and the Advanced Power Alliance — clean energy trade groups — supported the priority process proposal, saying it was narrowly tailored and non-discriminatory.

“The Priority Process will improve the efficient interconnection of new generating facility capacity by allowing incremental additions to existing generating facilities to come online in an expedited manner without impacting existing interconnection customers,” FERC said in its decision.

The priority process will be effective from Dec. 1, 2025, to March 1, when SPP’s recently proposed Consolidated Planning Process will take effect, if approved.

However, FERC rejected two related proposals that SPP filed separately. One would have allowed power plants that retired no more than five years ago to use the priority process to add capacity at those sites. Another would allow priority projects to be queued ahead of other interconnection requests in a Definitive Interconnection System Impact Study cluster if the review’s first phase hasn’t started.

FERC ruled that SPP’s proposal for allowing retired power plants to take advantage of the priority process lacked key details, including whether the new project could be 120% the size of the old one or just 20% of its size.

SPP also failed to adequately support its “queue priority” proposal, according to FERC.

“SPP offers several conclusory statements in its filing but does not provide sufficient evidence in the record to support a determination that the Queue Priority Revision is just and reasonable,” FERC said.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/e8aVfByOkZnqgtFNC6j258vrTLq242a_miskwi3z_Ik/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HUkVDLVVuaXQtMy5qcGc=.webp,N,,2025-12-01 13:01:16.686709

The event showcased the latest green technologies across various industries such as new energy, artificial intelligence, embodied intelligence and low-altitude economy, as well as green food products from around the world.
In recent years, China has actively advanced green energy transition through concrete actions, establishing the world's largest clean energy supply system.
Seah Shoo Chin, Malaysian State Executive Councillor for Malacca, welcomed Chinese enterprises to explore green industry cooperation in Malaysia.
""We look forward to further deepening cooperation in areas such as green food and clean energy in the future.""","NANCHANG, Dec. 1 (Xinhua) -- A robot named ""Pasini"" drew crowds at the 2025 World Green Development Investment and Trade Expo & China Green Food Expo, as it moved its mechanical arms, which are fitted with nearly 2,000 tactile sensors.

Indian blogger Amit Kumar raised his phone to livestream the scene to his followers overseas, enthusiastically explaining the advanced technology on display.

""This expo is amazing! It showcases cutting-edge green technologies while offering a chance to sample eco-friendly cuisine from around the world,"" Kumar said.

The event, held from Nov. 27 to 30 in Nanchang, capital of east China's Jiangxi Province, brought together more than 2,500 exhibitors from over 60 countries and regions.

The event showcased the latest green technologies across various industries such as new energy, artificial intelligence, embodied intelligence and low-altitude economy, as well as green food products from around the world. According to organizers, more than 60 projects worth 45 billion yuan (about 6.36 billion U.S. dollars) were signed.

In recent years, China has actively advanced green energy transition through concrete actions, establishing the world's largest clean energy supply system.

According to the Ministry of Ecology and Environment, China has helped reduce global wind and photovoltaic power generation costs by over 60 percent and 80 percent, respectively, and accounts for 46 percent of the world's renewable energy jobs.

By 2024, China's exports of wind and solar products had helped other countries cumulatively reduce carbon emissions by over 1 billion tonnes.

""China is actively seeking deeper cooperation in the global green industry and working toward its carbon peaking and carbon neutrality goals,"" said Jia Kang, a researcher at the Chinese Academy of Fiscal Sciences.

Seah Shoo Chin, Malaysian State Executive Councillor for Malacca, welcomed Chinese enterprises to explore green industry cooperation in Malaysia.

Malacca is advancing green projects such as waste-to-energy initiatives while offering industrial parks for investment and high-quality halal food certification. ""We hope to deepen China-Malaysia cooperation in green manufacturing, clean energy, and the circular economy, creating both inclusive and replicable projects,"" Seah said.

The exhibition also attracted buyers from across the globe, many of whom were impressed with the innovative products on display. Souley Flhadji Adamou from the Republic of Niger, who has been engaged in China-Africa trade for a decade, was seen testing a rideable electric suitcase.

""This suitcase can run up to 13 kilometers on a single charge. It's smooth and convenient to ride, and it holds significant market potential,"" he said.

At the Jiangxi Godfrey Technology Co., Ltd. booth, Immaculée Agbaka showcased the company's chargers, speakers and other products to international buyers.

""We've already had over 60 buyers proactively reach out to us, seeking to discuss cooperation details in depth,"" Agbaka said, noting that visitors from various regions brought diverse needs and suggestions, offering valuable insights for future product upgrades.

Mutale Nalumango, vice president of Zambia, stated at the opening ceremony of the expo that Zambia aspires to build a sustainable and resilient green economy, as climate change has led to prolonged droughts and erratic rainfall patterns, placing pressure on key sectors such as hydropower and agriculture.

""We are deeply grateful to Chinese enterprises and people for coming to Africa, especially for investing and establishing businesses in Zambia, including the development of industrial parks,"" Nalumango said.

The entire nation of Germany, and now issues with getting rare earth metals and magnets are hitting European companies hard.
Powers, said the best days this year to buy a new car will be Dec. 26 through New Year’s Eve.
“Dealers will lose money to sell cars at the end of the year,” Frehsee told the Detroit Free Press.
The Big Question What’s the best new car deal in your area?","The so-called ‘Magic Week’ is the time of the year when dealers are so desperate to get rid of cars that they’ll sell them for a loss. Is this a real thing? It can be, although there are all sorts of variables at play this year. Inventory is up, and sales are down, which is usually the perfect recipe for scoring a great deal.

There’s always a catch, right? The Internet loves a catch-y headline, and this time, for this Morning Dump, I’m going to go through all the catches. There’s the obvious one, which is that the best way to get a good deal is to have a lot of money in the first place. There’s more to it, though, as I’ll explore today.

You know who is super-reliant on China? The entire nation of Germany, and now issues with getting rare earth metals and magnets are hitting European companies hard. Germany has a plan, though, and it’s to walk back the 2035 EV mandate, which seems to play into the hands of Chinese automakers that want to sell EVs there.

It’s not just Europe that’s looking askance at Chinese automakers, as BYD just launched a much cheaper alternative to the popular plug-in hybrids in Japan.

The Good Deals And Not-So-Good Deals Will Depend A Lot On Where And What You Shop

While no rational person should expect to suddenly get a great deal everywhere on a super popular car like a Toyota Sienna or Honda CR-V, there’s some logic behind the idea that from December 26th to January 1st, you might be able to get your lowest price/best incentives on a new car.

Some of this is the market overall, as the year is expected to end with a thud, as Cox Automotive points out:

“The new-vehicle sales pace had been expected to slow in the fourth quarter, and that’s what we are seeing,” said Cox Automotive Senior Economist Charlie Chesbrough. “The headwinds from higher prices and fewer government subsidies for electric vehicles are finally slowing the market after a surprisingly strong previous six months. Sales began surging in the spring as buyers rushed to market to beat expected higher prices in the wake of announced tariffs. Now, with more tariffed products replacing existing non-tariffed inventory, prices are drifting higher, leading to slower sales which may last through the remainder of the year and into next year.”

As the Detroit Free Press reports, there is logic behind ‘magic week’ as well:

Overall, most car shopping experts and car dealers expect automakers to offer sizable incentives to move metal in December. General Motors has already started offering big discounts on Chevrolet Silverado pickups.

Likewise, many car dealers will negotiate more aggressively to get sales over the finish line to hit year-end targets. In fact, Tyson Jominy, vice president of data and analytics at J.D. Powers, said the best days this year to buy a new car will be Dec. 26 through New Year’s Eve. He calls it the “magic week” for car buying. Eric Frehsee, president of Tamaroff Auto Group, confirmed Jominy’s prediction.

“Dealers will lose money to sell cars at the end of the year,” Frehsee told the Detroit Free Press. “There’s all kinds of goals and targets to hit and no one wants to fall short.”

You probably can’t just call up your local dealer and ask them how close they are to their yearly target, so you’ll have to look a little closer at what you want. As referenced above, Chevy is putting a lot of might behind Silverado this year, and for good reason. Not only is it a high-margin, profitable vehicle, but Ford is in trouble.

Specifically, it may not be the best time to get an F-150 because the plant that processes the aluminum for F-150 production keeps catching on fire for some reason. This means deals for the Ford truck might be harder to come by, whereas Chevy wants the killshot of outselling the F-Series for a quarter, or at least the company wants to make Ford sweat a little.

As mentioned, the ongoing affordability catch is also there. While lending is loosening up a little bit, your best way to get a deal is to have great credit in order to negotiate lower financing on shorter terms. If you can afford a 48-month repayment and can put a lot of money down, you’ll ultimately pay less over the course of the loan than someone who has a higher interest rate and can only afford a much longer term.

Is there any upside here for buyers? Sure, if you’re a Costco member and have been for a while, there are a bunch of $1,250 incentives on GM or Polestar products.

As you can see in the chart above, there are also deals to be had in certain segments. Do you want a mid-size sedan? Sales are down, so maybe a deal on a Camry or Accord isn’t so far out there as a concept. Do you want a Nissan Altima? No. No one wants a Nissan Altima. However, the deals for those are probably going to be excellent depending on where you live.

The other place to look is for vehicles and automakers impacted by tariffs. This is probably a bad time to score a good deal on a European-built car, as European brands are looking to protect profitability.

So, yeah, deals are out there, but it’s going to depend more than usual on the brand, the vehicle, and the geography.

European Automakers And Suppliers Looking At Supply Chain Disruptions

The un-flattening of the world is starting to continue apace, especially with China’s Ministry of Commerce putting stricter export controls on its rare earth minerals and magnets. These materials are key to making all sorts of advanced goods, and the Chinese government is fully aware of this dependence. After a year of governments questioning their reliance on China and implementing trade barriers, China is responding by increasing bureaucratic hurdles.

A new survey by the European Chamber of Commerce points out just how tough this is:

Delivery times for impacted goods have been disrupted, with 40% of respondents indicating that export control approval processes have added upwards of two months to delivery times. A similar proportion (38%) expect ‘significant’ disruptions to their supply chains, or production stoppages or slowdowns, if all of China’s announced export controls are fully implemented.

[…]

“China’s export controls have increased the uncertainty felt by European businesses operating in the country, with companies facing risks of production slowdowns or even stoppages,” said Jens Eskelund, president of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China. “They have also prompted strong responses from China’s trading partners, which has added more pressure to a global trade system that was already under a great deal of stress.”

The EU recently passed high tariffs on Chinese-built EVs, over the protest of the German government.

Germany: Let’s Maybe Chill On Those EV-Only Mandates

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz would very much like it if the European Union didn’t keep its 2035 EV-only mandate, reports Bloomberg:

“Our goal should be a technology-neutral, flexible, and realistic CO2 regulation that meets the EU’s climate protection targets without jeopardizing innovation and industrial value creation,” Merz wrote in the letter, which reached von der Leyen’s office on Friday and was seen by Bloomberg.

Merz’s letter demands far-reaching changes to von der Leyen’s original plan to ban combustion engine vehicles by 2035. “We must consider the emissions of the entire passenger car fleet — that is, new registrations and existing vehicles,” Merz, the leader of Germany’s conservative CDU party, wrote.

The European Union is adoping EVs at a way faster rate than the United States, and even there the idea of getting rid of all combustion-powered cars without some sort of huge advancement seems difficult. I mean, one way could be lowering tariffs on Chinese cars and allowing that country’s automakers to sell a bunch of cheap EVs in Europe, but that’s even worse for German automakers.

Merz himself got elected partially on a promise to kick the economy back into gear which, in Germany, requires selling and building more cars.

BYD’s Sealion 6 Is Going To Challenge Japan’s Best

The BYD Sealion 6 is, visually, one of the least interesting vehicles for sale right now. From a technological and geopolitical standpoint, however, it’s fascinating. The BYD plan, besides selling EVs outside of China, seems to hinge on selling plug-in hybrids.

While tame, visually, the Sealion 6 is competitive on range and features with both the Toyota RAV4 Prime and Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV in Japan. On price? It’s not even close. The Sealion 6 will sell in Japan for about $25,600 for the FWD model, compared to $36,500 for a RAV4 and $34,100 for the Outlander. Even the AWD Sealion 6 is just $28,900 or so.

Will Japanese buyers go for it? There’s a reason why they may not, as Nikkei Asia reports:

The debut takes place with relations between Japan and China worsening. Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said in parliament that an armed attack on Taiwan could become “a survival-threatening situation” for Japan. In response, Beijing has taken a series of measures, including urging its citizens to avoid traveling to Japan.

In a group interview on Monday, Tofukuji said there has been no significant increase in canceled orders. “We have not received requests to cancel from customers awaiting delivery. Customers are observing the situation calmly.”

He also said the company has not received any requests to cancel Monday’s news conference from either the Japanese or Chinese governments.

“We cannot predict how bilateral relations will develop, going forward, and there is no major impact at this time,” he said. “But if such a relationship persists into the future, it is natural that concerns will arise.”

If the People’s Republic of China invades the Republic of China (Taiwan) it’s a scary moment for Japan, but the quesiton is how much Japanese buyers are influenced by geopolitics.

Cecil Thomas, D-Cincinnati, objected.","Ohio lawmakers introduced tweaks last month to a bill effectively prohibiting many immigrants from owning land in the state. Those changes include carveouts for green card holders and those who have served in the armed forces. But opponents don’t see the changes as much of an improvement.

The restrictions apply to people from countries designated as foreign adversaries. That list, compiled by the U.S. Secretary of Commerce, includes China, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, and Russia.

As part of Ohio’s 2023 state operating budget, Gov. DeWine allowed restrictions on foreign farmland ownership but refused to apply the same prohibitions to land within 25 miles of military installations. Ohio House Bill 1 revives those vetoed provisions and expands them to include critical infrastructure.

The sponsors’ stated concern is that allowing foreign governments, businesses, and agents to buy land nearby leaves the U.S. vulnerable to spying or sabotage.

“As legislators,” state Rep. Angie King, R-Celina, said when she introduced the bill, “we have a responsibility to protect Ohio from those who seek to undermine and destroy our American values and way of life.”

But critics, including civil rights groups and scores of immigrants from targeted countries, contend the bill is exceptionally harsh. The measure relies on a definition of critical infrastructure that includes large, discrete facilities like power plants, dams, and refineries, but it also extends to vast power and communication networks. For instance, every telephone and utility pole, the lines that run between them, and every cell tower fit squarely within that definition.

The changes

Barring ownership within 25 miles, as the original bill did, leaves little if any land in Ohio available. The amendment in the Ohio House reduced that limitation to 10 miles. But opponents say, with such an expansive list, even a one-mile ban “would render significant portions of Ohio inaccessible for families and businesses.”

In addition to reducing the radius of the bill’s exclusion zone, the amendment provides exemptions for legal permanent residents and people who have served or are serving in the military.

The changes also provide protection for property willed to someone, as well as property used to retire outstanding debts.

County prosecutors raised concerns early on about taking on potentially complex cases. “Without additional resources these cases will take time away from the core responsibilities of county prosecutors,” Ohio Prosecuting Attorneys Association Executive Director Lou Tobin said. The amendment includes a provision giving county prosecutors the ability to hand cases off to the state attorney general if they don’t have the resources to pursue them.

The bill grandfathers land already owned by individuals who would otherwise be prohibiting from ownership, but bars them from acquiring any other property. Should the measure take effect, anyone who becomes subject to the bill in the future would have to sell their property within two years.

In a joint statement, The Asian American Coalition of Ohio, Ohio Chinese American Association, and Justice for Ohio, acknowledged that narrowing the bill’s scope shows lawmakers are hearing them, but they insisted the changes don’t go nearly far enough.

The bill continues to discriminate against people in the U.S. lawfully, the groups said, based solely on their national origin — one of the seven protected characteristics laid out in the federal Fair Housing Act.

The bill also “conflicts directly with established U.S. and Ohio laws governing property ownership, due process and equal protection,” the groups added. Not only does the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution require equal protection, but Article 1 Section 1 of the Ohio Constitution includes “acquiring, possessing, and protecting property” among all individuals’ inalienable rights.

The groups noted as well that the prohibitions would discourage legitimate investment in the state.

“At a moment when Ohio is striving to attract advanced manufacturing, strengthen its workforce, and deepen international partnerships, H.B. 1 sends a damaging and counterproductive message,” they wrote.

As for the newly proposed 10-mile exclusion radius, the groups said, “no evidence has been presented that these sweeping geographic bans improve national security or public safety.”

After the amendment was introduced, state Rep. Juanita Brent, D-Cleveland, pressed supporters to provide a map of the state showing what property is and isn’t excluded. The chair, state Rep. Cindy Abrams, R-Harrison, made no promises, but said she’d ask the sponsors if they have one.

Just before the committee adopted the amendment, state Rep. Cecil Thomas, D-Cincinnati, objected.

“Obviously, it’s discriminatory, in my opinion, on its face,” he said of the bill.

“In my opinion, this particular bill will weaken Ohio’s economy and competitiveness, basically creating an environment that certain individuals or businesses from certain origins of the world are not welcome,” he said. “This bill would clearly create a potential for racial profiling and create a question of equal protection under the law.”

Clean Energy Regulator data shows the government agency expects 2.5GW of industry-scale renewable energy capacity to reach a final investment decision this year, down from 4GW last year. The 12-month average for investment commitments on new developments is at its lowest since early 2017.

While the share of electricity from renewable energy has increased to more than 40% after years of growth, experts have warned that the construction of solar and wind farms needs to accelerate substantially if the Albanese government is to meet a target of 82% of electricity coming from clean sources by 2030.

The regulator said there was “real potential” that much more could win financial backing next year, in part due to its expanded capacity investment scheme, an underwriting program for the solar, wind and batteries needed to replace ageing and dirty coal-fired power stations.

But the chief executive of the Clean Energy Investor Group, Richie Merzian, said the lower financial investment decisions were a “symptom of deep structural issues, not just a blip”.

“The structural issues include state planning delays, grid connection uncertainty, transmission constraints, rising project costs and lack of long-term revenue certainty,” he said.

Merzian said the underwriting program had helped to develop a large pipeline of potential projects, but that they would not deliver the new energy capacity needed unless companies made final investments.

“The contrast between the large pipeline and the limited number reaching [financial investment decision] indicates a system that is not functioning as intended,” he said.

Renewable energy that has previously had private financial signoff continues to be added to the grid. The Clean Energy Regulator said it anticipated nearly 7GW of large-scale generation and rooftop solar systems could be connected this year.

But the Climate Change Authority last week warned more would be needed if the government was to meet its targets. It said the pace of growth in large-scale renewable energy generation would need to more than double over the next five years.

Frankie Muskovic, executive director of policy for the Investment Group on Climate Change, said the reduced investment decisions this year were “a concerning trend” and needed to accelerate to meet renewable energy and climate targets. The latter includes a 43% cut in emissions by 2030 and at least a 62% cut by 2035, compared with 2005 levels.

She said some state planning changes and an ongoing review of the National Electricity Market could be causing uncertainty, but that large-scale renewable energy developments were often marginal investments and the underwriting program needed to offer more support for each project that received a contract.

Muskovic said the scheme should also run past its scheduled closure date of 2027. This would give investors greater confidence to back renewables projects, she said.

“Maybe we need more data to confirm if this is a blip, but everything we are hearing suggests this is not. We need to be ready and able to put more support into bolstering the [scheme],” she said. “We need to be shoulder to the wheel on this, and state governments need to be along for the ride.”

Giving an annual climate statement to parliament last week, the climate change minister Chris Bowen said the government had more than 16GW of renewable energy projects under contract or in negotiations through the capacity investment scheme so far, with up to 10 tender rounds remaining.

He said he expected about 11GW of capacity to have reached financial close by the end of 2026.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1fb353b80336d5be2f8d66ca112a27cf0a1d6b95/516_0_1213_971/master/1213.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=384a3a480b2b3818baacd104e05e6324",N,,2025-12-01 12:02:45.773890

WASHINGTON, Dec. 1, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Experts in energy, fuels, and emissions policy believe that unleashing American energy and pursuing decarbonization are not mutually exclusive objectives. These and related topics were the subject of a recent webinar by the Engine Technology Forum, ""Seeking Solutions for Sustainable Energy and Technology to Power a Resilient Economy"" which is now available to watch here.

After four years focused on decarbonization, there is now a realization that the aspirations of some past policy goals were out of sync with market realities and the desire to achieve greater energy security, both for the transportation and industrial sectors. At the same time, experts emphasized it is important that we make continued progress in achieving goals of cleaner air and greater energy security, along with access to affordable energy.

""Realizing the goals of both unleashing American energy and reducing emissions demands more advanced engines and renewable fuels, along with more electricity to power key sectors of the economy,"" said Allen Schaeffer, executive director of the Engine Technology Forum, the organizer of this session.

In his keynote presentation, Dr. Graham Conway, director at Pickering Energy Partners, outlined the framework of current U.S. policy and explained how the growing demand for electric power for artificial intelligence now dominates energy policy. He also compared global policies on electricity production and demand, highlighting the variable mix of power generation sources from coal to renewables across the globe, with a focus on the U.S.

As for transportation, progress toward achieving previously established national goals for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reductions was compared among the U.S., the European Union, and China. Over the next five years, there will likely be a continued need for policy measures that promote greener technologies, provide incentives for their adoption, and create carve-outs for sectors or circumstances that fall short of meeting these goals. The significance of life-cycle analysis as a true accounting of emissions was reviewed, and it was recognized that it should have a more central role in policymaking. Some analyses show that, over the life of a passenger vehicle, a hybrid vehicle using renewable fuels could achieve the same reduction in GHG emissions as a battery-electric vehicle, depending on the composition of electricity generating fuels from the grid.

Tammy Klein, founder and CEO of Transport Energy Strategies, reflected on the policy issues impacting fuel and technology choices in 2025. She expressed optimism about the EPA proposal for expanded renewable fuels volumes, while noting the challenges presented by other trade and tariff policies that affect fuel producers. She emphasized that consumers and energy prices are driving the national agenda today – a shift from the last four years. Overall, the U.S. is adding energy resources to meet increasing demand, decarbonizing where possible, and emphasizing true sustainability – a consideration of the social, environmental, and economic aspects of technology and fuels decisions. The ""all-of-the-above"" market-based approach best meets the demands of multiple use cases for various fuels and is preferred over a command-and-control approach, which in the past has established unachievable goals.

Dr. Ameya Joshi, founder of Mobility Notes, recognized the need for strong policies to drive technology development but also stressed the importance of incentives to encourage their adoption. He emphasized that reducing urban air pollution remains an equally important goal, one that is sometimes overshadowed by GHG policy. Dr. Joshi also noted that other countries are watching shifts in U.S. policy and considering how those changes will influence global emissions standards and overall decision-making.

""In one way or another, advanced engines and fuels are at the forefront of achieving the goals of economic prosperity, energy dominance, and lower emissions,"" noted Schaeffer. The panel concurred about the key role of internal combustion engines in the future and the need for continued progress in lowering emissions and improving efficiency.

The memorandum exempted these mining projects from the requirement of public consultation under the Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) Notification, 2006.
The Minister said the communication from Tamil Nadu was examined in detail.
According to the reply, the Ministry clarified that the exemption was linked to the strategic importance of critical, strategic, and atomic minerals for India's energy transition, defence preparedness, space research and nuclear power programme.
The Minister also said that no amendment to the EIA Notification was required because the exemption was already provided for in the 2006 notification.","The Centre on Monday (December 1, 2025) said it has received a letter from the Tamil Nadu Government opposing the exemption granted to projects involving mining of critical, strategic and atomic minerals from public consultation.

It also said, “The exemption will not compromise environmental, social, health, and livelihood concerns.” In a written reply in Lok Sabha, Union Minister of State for Environment, Kirti Vardhan Singh, said the letter dated September 12 requested the withdrawal of the office memorandum issued on September 8.

The memorandum exempted these mining projects from the requirement of public consultation under the Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) Notification, 2006.

The Minister said the communication from Tamil Nadu was examined in detail. The Environment Ministry informed the State Government that the exemption was issued under an already existing provision of the EIA Notification, Clause 7(III)(i)(f), which allows projects relating to national defence, security or other strategic considerations to be exempted from public consultation.

According to the reply, the Ministry clarified that the exemption was linked to the strategic importance of critical, strategic, and atomic minerals for India's energy transition, defence preparedness, space research and nuclear power programme.

It also stated that the exemption will not compromise environmental, social, health, and livelihood concerns, which would continue to be addressed through the existing EIA mechanism, including an environment management plan, appraisal by an expert committee, and post-environmental clearance monitoring.

“The solar power ramps up and down with the sunlight,” says Josh Underberg, plant manager at Redfield Energy in Redfield, South Dakota.
Solar Support Redfield began operating its 11.5-MWh direct current solar field in December of 2024.
“Ethanol producers are a good candidate for solar energy because anyone who pays a retail utility electric bill can potentially be a good candidate,” he says.
“It makes the energy project more successful because now they need less energy and so a larger proportion of their energy is green than if they just went for the green energy project on its own.","As its 65-acre solar field hums along providing half of its power needs, Redfield Energy operates business as usual. The system, situated next to the plant, is seamless, with no flickers or interruptions.

“The solar power ramps up and down with the sunlight,” says Josh Underberg, plant manager at Redfield Energy in Redfield, South Dakota. “Nothing changes here, we don’t have any power flickers, we don’t have any issues whatsoever.”

The solar field, designed, installed, operated and maintained by All Energy Solar Inc., has been in service for about one year and is not the only upgrade Redfield implemented in the past two years. Installation of a Whitefox ICE Plus system has improved efficiency and is poised to boost production from 65 MMgy to at least 72 MMgy, says Eric Baukol, Redfield Energy CEO.

“From a company standpoint, we’re growing, and we certainly want to grow, but right now our focus is making our gallons that we have better from a CI standpoint more so than just expanding to expand,” Baukol says.

Solar Support

Redfield began operating its 11.5-MWh direct current solar field in December of 2024. The capital investment amounted to about $20 million and installation took about one year, Baukol says.

The first six months showed some standard startup hiccups, but the second have shown the expected results. “So far, we have seen what we expected to see, which is a couple point reduction in our CI score by producing approximately half of our electricity,” Baukol says. “The investment was based off a model of a 2.2-point reduction in our CI score, and what we’re seeing in the second half of the year lines up with that expectation.”

“I’ve learned from others in the solar industry that you typically see some hiccups right away and then they run really well, and so far, that’s what we’ve seen,” Underberg says.

When Redfield committed to the investment, the 45Z Production Tax Credit had not yet been announced, but the benefits in cost savings and access to West Coast markets still incentivized the project.

“It was still a great option for our gallons that are heading west, California, Oregon, Washington,” Baukol says. “So if your gallons are spread that way, it’s a good investment.”

The solar array at Redfield operates on a pivoting system, east to west as the sun travels across the sky each day, according to Michael Thalhimer, director of business development for All Energy Solar, adding that not all solar fields have panels that pivot, but the option does “get more juice out of the lemon.”

All Energy Solar is focused on being an end-to-end solution provider, working in collaboration with customers for optimal success, Thalhimer says. “That’s what sets us up to be successful in this space—we are really collaborative. We tend to codevelop the project with the client instead of saying, ‘We’ll let you know when we need to come install this system on your acreage.’

“We support development, which is a big part of the timeline for these projects, typically much longer than the construction phase.”

While the process to get the project developed, up and running can be measured in years not months, the systems are designed to operate long-term, Thalhimer notes. “These are 30- to 40-year systems, so our capabilities don’t stop after the install.”

The project runway is several years, he says, so conversations need to start early. “It’s a thorough and long process to get these developed from initial discussions. It’s not plug and play. It requires design and engineering.”

All Energy handles operations and maintenance as well as warranty management and other elements of its clients’ projects, ideally without out-sourcing. “We are just now in the first year of supporting the Redfield project with operations and maintenance support, and we aim to stay connected with that project as long as they’ll have us,” he says.

“Ethanol producers are a good candidate for solar energy because anyone who pays a retail utility electric bill can potentially be a good candidate,” he says.

Year-over-year energy price increases are now resembling a hockey stick, Thalhimer adds. “It is not a steady uptick anymore.” The ethanol industry is laden with high energy consumers, he says, with adjacent land available for solar fields.

“So we provide an alternative solution to providing power for the facility, big or small, and if all the stars align, you end up with the type of project we have with Redfield, where they are producing 10 megawatts of electricity for their facility every day.”

The long-term benefit of a solar field helps curtail those ever-increasing costs, he says. “The energy avoidance of delivered power from the grid is a really long tail benefit. That’s the part of this we’re really proud of—we’re not just giving a system that gets ripped up and replaced when there’s something different in the next four or five years. These are really tested and built to last and to be really multi-decade operating systems for the customers.

“That’s why we’re really suited for these projects, because we’re in it for the long haul.”

Solar Incentives

Thalhimer outlines two main financial incentives for investments in renewable energy such as solar fields. The first is the federal 48E Clean Electricity Investment tax credit. It’s measured as a percentage of the total project cost that the investor can receive back within the first year of the project being in service. For most industrial and commercial-scale renewable power projects as of late, this is 30% of the project cost, Thalhimer says.

“That is set up to be able to come directly back to the owner/investor of the project, based on the tax year the project is put in service,” he says.

Second is the depreciation of the asset. Right now, investments like this qualify for 100% bonus depreciation, which means they can get the full benefit of that particular incentive in the first year. In most cases, the depreciation value is quite similar to the investment tax credit—30%. “That means, together, 60-plus percent of the project cost can be returned within a year of that investment being made in full through two levers,” Thalhimer emphasizes.

“They really accelerate return on investment when almost two-thirds of that project investment comes back within that first year, before you’re even talking about the energy sales.”

Thalhimer notes that for ethanol producers, 45Z is the “extra icing on the cake,” potentially to the tune of a seven-figure credit.

“Solar is absolutely a qualifying investment to earn that credit, as long as you eclipse the necessary CI point improvements to qualify,” he says. “That is another huge potential credit to leverage in addition to the federal tax credit and the depreciation.”

But the policy landscape is changing, with new standards for 48E coming this year. A new set of restrictions prohibits materials from certain foreign entities. “That does affect our industry and supply chain globally because a lot of solar electric equipment has been manufactured for decades in the far east and that is one of the main areas coming under more scrutiny for imports,” Thalhimer says.

For those who have commenced their project close to or at construction phase, the prior set of rules and policy still fully applies. For those starting efforts in the shorter term, an investment by July 4, 2026 can safe harbor the tax credit.

“While we still have some time to leverage, the rules are changing and starting those conversations sooner will give you the most amount of time to fully develop a concept and see if we can execute it,” Thalhimer says.

Distillation Efficiency

In tandem with sourcing half of its power needs from an on-site solar field, Redfield is also reducing the energy required for operations, according to Gillian Harrison, CEO of Whitefox. The plant started up its new Whitefox ICE Plus membrane-based dehydration system in October 2025.

“So it’s that combination,” Harrison explains. “They’re shrinking their demand to start with in the production process by doing ICE Plus, and then they’re greening their energy source for the energy that they need.”

ICE Plus was developed as a stepping stone from ICE—adding Whitefox’s proprietary membrane dehydration solution to operate complementary to molecular sieves by taking regen and other streams from distillation—to ICE XL—a full replacement of all molecular sieves with membrane technology. ICE Plus leaves the molecular sieve infrastructure in place but operating at reduced capacity while the membranes work alongside them to debottleneck.

“So we’re effectively extending the lifetime by taking load off the sieves, but enabling them in the future to think about replacing those molecular sieves with membranes in a staged approach,” Harrison says. “You can add more membranes in a modular way rather than doing it all in one.”

The ICE systems are designed to increase efficiency and throughput with a CI score reduction. Baukol says the setup at Redfield aims to knock 3.5 points off of the plant’s CI score.

“They are getting used to a different way of running their plant quite quickly, which is brilliant, really,” Harrison says. “They have found the membrane piece relatively straight forward to run. I think they’re finding that easier than the molecular sieve. That’s a testament to their team and ours, and how our respective teams have worked together to do the training and get familiar with a different way of running their facility.”

Decarbonizing energy sources and reducing energy demand go hand-in-hand, she adds. “It makes the energy project more successful because now they need less energy and so a larger proportion of their energy is green than if they just went for the green energy project on its own. The combination works very well.”

Large projects like solar installations require a core of advocates in an organization to champion the changes, Thalhimer says. “This took a village,” he says of Redfield’s solar field. “This was not a quick yes.

“Redfield’s board really got behind this project as a smart, long-term initiative for them. This wasn’t a box-checker. This adds a lot of value to their organization.”

Because they’re not charging the cost of service.” Glass half-full Harrisburg lawmakers have sought to reform Act 12, but to no avail.
And now, as they revisit Act 12, lawmakers are expected to wade into the debate over repealing or reforming the statute.
While acknowledging that reforms are needed, Barrow added that the regulatory environment must remain investor-friendly to ensure the state’s neglected water systems can attract buyers.","Corporate mergers are nothing new; neither is the privatization of public utilities. But thanks to last month’s $40 billion merger announcement of American Water and Essential Utilities (also known as Aqua), the two largest municipal water and wastewater management companies in the U.S., Pennsylvanians are being confronted with what it means to be on the front lines of both trends – at the same time.

Municipalities across the commonwealth, already treading water financially while overseeing aging water and sewer systems, are now fertile ground for private-sector utility companies to acquire local systems in exchange for cash up front.

And while the details of the merger have yet to be determined, according to the press release, the move will allow both companies to “maintain an average customer water bill that is affordable (and support) the economic prosperity of the more than 2,000 communities in which the combined company will operate.”

Consumer advocates, on the other hand, worry what the merger will mean for ratepayers.

“We just don’t know the impact that this acquisition is going to have on utility rates yet, but I would say it doesn’t particularly bode well for consumers to have one mega-utility serving most of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania,” Patrick Cicero, of counsel to the Pennsylvania Utility Law Project and a former state consumer advocate, told City & State.

Private eyes

Pennsylvania – one of 15 states to have enacted “fair market value” laws to boost the sale price of water systems, according to the National Association of Water Companies – was already known among water companies and their shareholders as being industry-friendly. Since the passage of Act 12 of 2016, a statewide framework for utility sales, the state has seen even more local water systems acquired by private companies.

According to the Public Utility Commission, 31 privatization cases have been filed since Act 12 took effect, with 25 acquisitions getting approval, three still pending, and three others either withdrawn, rejected or denied. Prior to Act 12’s passage, acquisitions of municipal utilities were relatively infrequent because systems were only allowed to be sold for their depreciated book value, which was not financially attractive to the utility companies and municipalities.

Act 12 mandates that the seller and prospective buyer each select an independent consultant from a group vetted by the state Public Utility Commission – the entity responsible for overseeing more than 150 water utilities statewide, most of which are privately owned.

Consultants for each side have six months to calculate an estimated value of the water system based on its infrastructure, anticipated revenue, and costs for maintenance and improvements necessary to maintain compliance with health and safety regulations.

The acquisition price is then determined by averaging the two estimates, unless the parties agree to a lower price, creating a pathway for higher figures than in deals prior to the passage of Act 12.

With Act 12, the standard deduction for grants and other subsidies used on the systems over the years has been eliminated. At the same time, the system assessments can include income, which wasn’t the case before.

Kimberly Barrow, vice chair of the PUC, said that prior to Act 12, the commission’s review of a potential acquisition was “pretty straightforward,” relying on depreciated original cost – the original cost of the assets minus the total accumulated depreciation – which, she said, is a “tenet of rate-making, historically.”

“Now, instead of looking at the original cost, we’re looking at two figures,” Barrow told City & State. “It’s going to be the negotiated purchase price or it’s going to be the fair market value – the lesser of those two things … That can be completely divorced from the original cost minus depreciation.”

The end result is higher numbers for acquisitions, meaning more cash for municipalities seeking to sell off their assets and address long-term budget and debt obligations. But with higher agreements of sale comes the need for increasing usage rates, which are ultimately paid by residents who rely on the utility.

“By allowing these kinds of valuations to be above original depreciated costs, it’s like (dangling) a carrot,” Barrow said. “It’s a way of getting the investor-owned utilities to actually want to buy them and put the money in.”

While acknowledging the importance of incentivizing prospective buyers to acquire failing or stressed municipal systems, Barrow said Act 12’s unintended consequences could result in rate spikes for low-income communities.

Industry advocates argue that the statute benefits both the municipalities and potential buyers by presenting a more accurate picture of the utility’s value. They say that the previous framework’s valuations resulted in a lower probability that potential buyers would achieve an adequate return on investment.

“For someone to suggest that purchase prices of acquisitions are the main driver of the costs associated with water and wastewater in Pennsylvania is not true,” Thom Chiomento, vice president of business development, government and external affairs at Pennsylvania American Water, told City & State.

Pennsylvania American Water filed a rate adjustment request with the PUC on Nov. 14, saying it will help fund over $1.2 billion in critical infrastructure upgrades through June 2027. The planned upgrades, according to the press release, include eliminating lead service lines by 2037 and replacing 117 miles of aging water mains and 32 miles of aging wastewater mains.

The proposed statewide rate increases would cost around $10 more per month for sewer, $14 more per month for water and $20 per month more for customers of both. If approved, it would be the second increase for the utility’s residential customers this year.

Chiomento added that the large-scale customer service, material procurement and capital a private company can provide are necessary in many municipalities whose water systems are running out of capital.

“It’s not cheap to run these systems and to invest in them and to get them to where they need to be from a compliance and an operational reliability perspective,” Chiomento told City & State. “So in order to do that, we have to invest dollars – and that is reflected in rates.”

Cicero, who pushed back against some water system acquisitions during his time as consumer advocate, argues that the statute “ties the hands” of the Public Utility Commission and leaves little wiggle room for debate over what he calls the “affirmative public benefit” that a sale is supposed to entail.

“We made a mistake with Act 12,” Cicero said. “All that it’s done is inflate the value of systems for these private companies.

“Even if (utility companies) are being magnanimous about going in and trying to make a system better, the rates are going to go up. And although they have modest rate assistance programs, they’re fundamentally inadequate to ensure affordability,” Cicero added, noting that since 2016, water bills – which have risen as much as 166% – have cost commonwealth ratepayers an additional $100 million a year.

Flood gates

Years of pushing infrastructure improvements and repairs down the line has led to many municipal or family-owned water systems developing regulatory and environmental problems, from leaks to chemical exposures that lead to boil-water advisories.

Pennsylvania received a “C-” grade on the 2022 American Society of Civil Engineers report card, with its wastewater management score at the bottom with a “D-.” According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s 2023 Drinking Water Infrastructure Needs Survey, Pennsylvania is projected to require a $24.3 billion investment over the next two decades to modernize and maintain its drinking water systems.

In some cases, private utility companies needed to step in via receivership to ensure that services continued in local systems, even before an acquisition process began. Companies like American Water or Essential can utilize their existing resources to support the system by providing necessary infrastructure investments.

“Their local governments didn’t have the resources to properly invest in those systems. There was mismanagement on top of that, and those people suffered,” Chiomento told City & State. “People in poor communities tend to suffer when their governments don’t have the ability to invest in them.”

And for many municipally operated systems, the years of neglect coincide with artificially depressed rates because politically unpopular rate increases were also put off.

The combination of these crumbling systems and the regulatory environment created by Act 12 has led to more privatization and, in turn, private investment in struggling systems. For example, Pennsylvania American Water has plans to acquire six different systems in 2025 alone.

“What we bring to the table is, no matter who our customers are or what communities they live in, they get the benefit of our ability to invest,” Chiomento said. “We’re investing in those communities because we’re not bound by their local government’s budget.”

A municipality “may want to simply not (hold on to) the water and wastewater business. They may have municipal debt that they want to retire. They have other needs they want to pursue – all of that makes abundant sense for municipalities,” Cicero said. “The question is whether or not it makes sense at all for the ratepayers of the acquiring utility to pay an excessive cost.”

Chiomento argued that the rate increases are just a sign of the times, pointing out the dire situations many systems are in and the artificially depressed rates municipalities have been charging utility customers over the years.

“When people talk about these big rate increases because of acquisitions, what they’re talking about is the price they were paying before,” he said.

“When we’re acquiring (a municipality’s) customers, rates typically are going up. Why are they in that situation to begin with? Because they’re not charging the cost of service.”

Glass half-full

Harrisburg lawmakers have sought to reform Act 12, but to no avail. Some legislative proposals, including ones to put guardrails on private acquisitions and to cap the acquisition amount at 125% of the depreciated original cost, have been considered in the Capitol and have support from those who say consumers shouldn’t bear the brunt of the infrastructure investments.

State Rep. Robert Matzie, who in 2023 introduced a legislative package during the previous legislative session aimed at reforming Act 12, said the results of the statute have “run far afield of that original intent.”

“(In) almost every instance to date, the municipalities or municipal authorities have exercised the provisions of the Act to sell healthy systems at amounts much greater than their current value,” Matzie said at the time in the co-sponsorship memo. “This has resulted in taxpayers and ratepayers being hit with exorbitant rate increases, with no discernible difference or improvement of service.”

Chiomento said industry stakeholders are “open to any modifications” to the statute, “as long as they improve the process, have a fair evaluation of these systems and they promote public input, transparency, and allow sufficient time for regulatory review.”

He also argued that the PUC – tasked with overseeing these deals and rate cases – exists to ensure that acquisitions like those by Pennsylvania American Water are prudent and reasonable.

Barrow agreed, stating that she’s not worried about “utilities consolidating,” as long as the PUC “is doing its job” and ensuring that customer service remains affordable.

Cicero argues that the PUC needs to do more to ensure rates are equitable across communities and that ratepayers aren’t taking on more of the financial burden than necessary post-acquisition.

“One of the main criticisms I have of the Public Utility Commission is they do not particularly hold utilities accountable on things like returns on equity, which seems problematic to me,” Cicero said, adding that “there has to be an affirmative public benefit” for an acquisition to be approved.

The future of both public and private utilities in the commonwealth will continue to revolve around how water systems can be maintained and invested in while keeping rates reasonable for those using the water services. And now, as they revisit Act 12, lawmakers are expected to wade into the debate over repealing or reforming the statute.

While acknowledging that reforms are needed, Barrow added that the regulatory environment must remain investor-friendly to ensure the state’s neglected water systems can attract buyers.

“There’s a need for something like Act 12, but there’s also a need for some control on it as well,” she said, adding that a cap on the acquisition amount is a possibility. “Some form of a cap (may be necessary) because at the end of the day, it’s ratepayer-supported funds that are being used to buy these systems.”

“It really is a balancing act, and Act 12 has the potential to help a lot of customers, like tens of thousands of customers throughout this commonwealth – it really does,” she told City & State. “We’re trying to do what we can (as the PUC), but we can’t change the act on our own.”",https://cdn.cityandstatepa.com/media/img/cd/2025/12/01/GettyImages_1216844681_Cwieders_headline/open-graph.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 12:03:05.782632

The rules, issued just as Americans gathered to celebrate Thanksgiving, expand the loopholes that the EPA announced when it first suspended deadlines without any prior public notice or chance to comment.

Methane is a greenhouse gas 80 times as potent as carbon dioxide over 20 years. These standards are a critical part of cutting the pollution causing climate change, as well as the volatile organic compounds that lead to smog and local air pollution.

The following is a comment from David Doniger, senior strategist at NRDC (Natural Resources Defense Council):

“The EPA is giving the worst actors a free pass to pollute.

“Methane leaks are the dumbest kind of pollution because the industry is losing the very product it wants to sell. That’s what made the standards so cost effective: Checking for leaks means the industry has more gas to sell, which is why established companies started plugging their leaks before the EPA mandated it.

“But a few rogue actors refused to get on board, and the Trump administration is catering to them. Those companies get some short-term profits, but neighboring communities will see more smog, more cancer-causing pollutants, and more climate risks.

The move is likely to prove “controversial among environmentalists”, investment bank Jefferies said in a research note.

Historically, most multilateral development banks and other lenders have not included nuclear power generation in the energy projects they finance due to concerns regarding nuclear waste management, inexperience in financing such projects, or high investment costs.

However, in a research note published in June, Washington DC think-tank the Atlantic Council argued that prolonged construction timelines and high capital costs for nuclear energy projects “may eventually deter” commercial banks from maintaining their support for the technology.

Attitudes towards the controversial technology also appear to be shifting in Europe. In November, the president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development told The Banker it is open to financing small modular nuclear projects if there is sufficient demand from countries.

Historically the EBRD only focused on nuclear safety and the decommissioning of former Soviet nuclear power plants. However, Odile Renaud-Basso said it is “actively monitoring” private sector demand for small nuclear or modular reactors, which are viewed as a safer and more cost-effective way of generating nuclear energy.

Earlier this year, the World Bank’s board reversed a 60-year-old ban on financing nuclear power, opting instead for an “all of the above” approach to energy projects in poorer countries, including lending for natural gas, geothermal, hydroelectric, solar, wind and nuclear power. The change in policy is said to have come after the US political administration applied pressure on the MDB to review its policies.

Announcing its re-entry into the nuclear energy financing space back in June, World Bank president Ajay Banga said “we must help countries deliver reliable, affordable power. That’s why we’re embracing nuclear energy as part of the solution — and re-embracing it as part of the mix the World Bank Group can offer developing countries to achieve their ambitions.”

While some EU countries have opposed the inclusion of nuclear energy in the EU’s flagship green taxonomy, which defines activities considered to be environmentally sustainable, the economic bloc’s General Court recently dismissed a challenge by Austria against the inclusion of nuclear energy and natural gas in the taxonomy.

The court action followed action taken by the European Commission in 2022 to include “certain activities” in the nuclear energy and gas sectors as contributing substantially to reducing the effects of climate change.",https://d2iztrg3kgqpue.cloudfront.net/production/9bd9e905-8850-4d4e-87ca-7ee0455d11d8.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 14:02:03.769150

Dive Brief:

Electric vehicle charging network operator Ionna plans to invest $250 million to expand public EV charging infrastructure in California over the next three years, the company announced in a Nov. 20 press release.

Ionna, the joint venture of eight major automakers, is currently building out an extensive EV charging network in the U.S. that customers of each OEM can use as a way to promote EV adoption, address the lack of convenient access to public chargers and facilitate long-distance, coast-to-coast travel.

The company recently held kickoff ceremonies in California for its newly opened public chargers in San Francisco, Sacramento, San Diego, San Jose and Westminster, which Ionna says is only “a fraction” of the 1,000 charging bays it’s contracted to install across the state. Nationwide, Ionna plans to install up to 30,000 EV chargers by 2030.

Dive Insight:

Ionna was established in July 2023 as a joint venture between automakers BMW, General Motors, Honda, Hyundai, Kia, Mercedes-Benz, Stellantis and Toyota. In February, the company announced it was transitioning from its public beta phase to full-scale national rollout of its charging network.

Despite the Dept. of Transportation’s revised guidance for the distribution of federal funding to construct public EV charging infrastructure in the U.S., Ionna continues to expand its network. The company is not reliant on federal funds to construct its charging sites. Instead, its funding comes from private capital.

To promote the newly opened charging sites in California, Ionna launched an “EV Education Program” to teach new EV drivers about the benefits of electric mobility. Following the opening of each new location, Ionna ambassadors partner with local dealerships and EV groups to host an event at the site to demonstrate how easy it is to charge an EV at a Ionna-branded charger.

“This week’s expansion into California is a snapshot of the national momentum IONNA has built in under a year’s time,” said Seth Cutler, CEO of Ionna, in a statement. “‘IONNA Speed’ isn’t just about how quickly we grow, but also how we deliver, and the IONNA team consistently operates with a driver-first mentality to elevate the charging experience.”

Some flagship Ionna charging sites are referred to as “Rechargeries” and offer amenities such as food and drinks, restrooms and driver lounges to relax in.

Ionna is also rolling out “plug-in and charge” capabilities at its Rechargeries, allowing EV drivers to simply plug in and charge without needing a credit card for payment. Its chargers currently support plug-in and charge functionality for BMW, General Motors, Hyundai, Kia, Mercedes-Benz and more recently, Rivian and Ford EVs. Ionna’s plug-in and charge technology will roll out to Honda, Stellantis, Toyota EVs in 2026, per the release.

Last December, Ioanna announced a partnership with c-store operator Sheetz to install chargers at more than 50 of the retailer’s locations by the end of 2026, beginning with Florida.

In July, Ionna announced a new partnership with Pennsylvania-based convenience store chain Wawa, which increased its contracted EV charging hubs to over 3,000 at the time.

Introduction and Summary

The Information Technology and Innovation Foundation (ITIF) is pleased to submit the following comments for consideration by the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) for the Request for Comments on the Section 301 Investigation of China’s Implementation of Commitments under the Phase One Agreement. ITIF is an independent, nonprofit, nonpartisan research and educational institute focusing on the intersection of technological innovation and public policy.

China has failed to meet its commitments under the U.S.-China Phase One Agreement (POA).[1] This agreement sought to address long-standing U.S. concerns about China’s predatory practices by pairing existing tariffs with commitments from the People’s Republic of China (PRC) on intellectual property (IP) and technology transfer, foreign investment, and currency practices. It also included a two-year, $200 billion purchase pledge.[2] This filing shows that China failed to meet its commitments across all of these aspects.

China is not a reliable trade partner, as potential commitments to reverse its predatory practices are antithetical to its long-term techno-economic project. This filing first provides evidence of ITIF’s work on Chinese non-market practices by detailing a 2021 ITIF report on China’s failure to meet its commitments under its World Trade Organization (WTO) accession. Then, it succinctly shows ITIF’s work assessing China’s global power project and its playbook of predatory, non-market practices to achieve it. This section concludes with examples of how this project gets translated into building critical sectors and boosting Chinese companies and industries.

The following section details how China failed to meet its purchasing commitments and summarizes ITIF’s recent work on China’s economic espionage and its role in facilitating the entry of counterfeits into the U.S. market.

Finally, the document concludes with recommendations to USTR. First, the current Section 301 investigation will allow the U.S. government to impose tariffs on Chinese manufacturers that continue to benefit from innovation mercantilist practices. Second, ITIF proposes using Section 301 authorities to impose import controls on goods from Entity List companies, exclude IP-infringing companies from the U.S. market, and impose “immediate reciprocity” in sectors where mercantilist practices forcefully limit the U.S. presence in the Chinese market.

Overview: China Is Not a Reliable Partner and It Does Not Intend to Change Its Nonmarket Approach

The Chinese government has a long record of broken promises, promoting nominally fair policies while aggressively imposing nonmarket interventions to support its local industries. The list of deceptive promises and statements is long. For example, in September 2015, in Seattle, Washington, Xi Jinping stated that “the Chinese government will not, in whatever form, engage in commercial theft or encourage or support such attempts by anyone.”[3] In July 2018, the PRC’s State Council released a statement indicating that “China has never had a policy of forcing technology transfers from foreign companies.”[4] Most recently, in April 2025, the Ministry of Commerce stated that China would protect the “legitimate rights and interests of foreign-funded enterprises in accordance with the law, and actively promote the resolution of foreign-funded enterprises.”[5] These promises are misleading because they commit to doing things (i.e., implementing market-based policies) that are antithetical to the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) project. Indeed, China has clearly failed to fulfill the commitments it made to peer nations as a condition for joining the WTO, especially the promise to manage its trade and economic activities in line with the core WTO principles of national treatment, non-discrimination, and reciprocity.

China’s State-Led Economic Model Stands at Odds With Market Economy Principles

China’s economic success represents a tale of mercantilism and state-driven non-market interventions (including subsidizing overproduction, stealing IP, and forcing technology transfer or foreign direct investment from companies) on the one hand, and complacency and naivety from Western policymakers on the other hand. ITIF’s 2021 report “False Promises II: The Continuing Gap Between China’s WTO Commitments and Its Practices” enumerated 12 high-level examples of how China has systematically and consistently failed to meet its WTO commitments:[6]

▪ Rejecting the WTO’s market orientation. China has never truly embraced the WTO’s core premise of open, market-oriented policies guided by commercial, rather than political, considerations. Instead, Beijing operates a “China Inc.” system in which the party-state routinely intervenes to steer outcomes, undercutting the basic assumption that market forces drive competition.

▪ Defying WTO norms through state-led industrial planning. China’s industrial strategies—exemplified by “Made in China 2025” and a lattice of sectoral plans—explicitly seek absolute advantage in advanced industries by displacing foreign firms at home and expanding Chinese firms’ global market share abroad. These state-directed schemes violate the spirit of WTO rules, which presume that governments will not use industrial planning to rig competitive outcomes in favor of domestic champions.

▪ Continuing prevalence of and preferences for state-owned enterprises (SOEs). Contrary to its commitments, China has not reduced the role of state-owned enterprises or ensured that they operate on a purely commercial basis. SOEs continue to receive privileged financing, regulatory forbearance, and preferential access to public procurement and key inputs, distorting competition in both China’s domestic market and global markets.

▪ Massively subsidizing its industries, often leading to overcapacity. Beijing deploys extensive, often opaque subsidies—grants, tax breaks, cheap land, and below-market finance—to accelerate capacity growth in targeted sectors such as steel, aluminum, solar, shipbuilding, autos, semiconductors, and many other sectors. The result is chronic overcapacity that depresses global prices, displaces more efficient producers in market economies, and undermines the WTO’s goal of fair, rules-based competition.

▪ Failing to make timely and transparent notifications of subsidies. China has systematically failed to provide full, timely, and accurate notifications of its subsidy programs, despite clear obligations to do so under WTO rules. This lack of transparency makes it exceedingly difficult for other members to assess the scale and impact of China’s support measures or to challenge them effectively through WTO processes.

▪ Forcing technology transfer and joint venture requirements. Beijing continues to use a mix of formal and informal tools—joint-venture requirements, equity caps, licensing demands, administrative reviews, and regulatory approvals—to coerce foreign firms into transferring technology as the price of market access. These practices violate both the letter and spirit of China’s WTO commitments to refrain from conditioning investment or trade on technology transfer requirements.

▪ Failing to respect foreign IP rights. While China has improved its IP laws on paper, enforcement remains weak, selective, and often politicized, leaving foreign firms exposed to theft and misappropriation of trade secrets, patents, and copyrights. Persistent large-scale IP infringement and limited effective remedies demonstrate that China has not delivered on its obligation to provide robust, non-discriminatory protection for foreign IP.

▪ Abusing antitrust rules. Chinese competition authorities have frequently wielded antitrust law as an industrial-policy tool, targeting foreign firms for investigations, remedies, and fines that appear designed to force technology transfer, lower royalty rates, or advantage domestic rivals. Rather than applying competition rules on a neutral basis, China often uses them to pursue strategic industrial goals inconsistent with WTO expectations.

▪ Imposing discriminatory technology standards. China’s standards system remains heavily state-managed and is frequently used to advance domestic technologies and firms at the expense of foreign competitors. Standards are often developed in closed processes, embed design choices that favor Chinese products, and can be tied to mandatory certification schemes, contravening WTO principles of transparency, non-discrimination, and open participation.

▪ Closing its government procurement to foreign actors. Despite longstanding commitments, China has neither acceded to the WTO Government Procurement Agreement nor provided equivalent market access to foreign competitors. Chinese authorities continue to favor domestic firms—especially SOEs��in procurement decisions, using public purchasing as another lever to bolster national champions and restrict reciprocal opportunities for foreign companies.

▪ Continuing use of service-market access restrictions. China maintains extensive barriers to foreign participation in key service sectors—including finance, telecommunications, cloud computing, audiovisual services, and digital platforms—through equity caps, licensing hurdles, and other entry restrictions. These measures fall far short of the openness implied by China’s WTO commitments and deny foreign providers meaningful, non-discriminatory access.

▪ Using retaliatory trade remedies. Beijing has repeatedly used antidumping, countervailing duty, and other trade-remedy investigations in ways that appear retaliatory rather than grounded in objective economic analysis. Such actions are aimed at pressuring trading partners and deterring legitimate complaints about Chinese practices, further eroding confidence in the WTO’s rules-based system.

China’s Development Playbook Is at Odds With What It Committed to Under the Phase One Agreement

ITIF’s November 2025 report “Marshaling National Power Industries to Preserve America’s Strength and Thwart China’s Bid for Global Dominance,” among other topics, outlines China’s strategy for techno-economic dominance.[7] The PRC is executing a coordinated, state-directed campaign across “national power industries”—advanced, traded sectors that underpin military strength and geostrategic leverage—to attempt to attain hegemony over Western democracies. This scheme is inseparable from a durable, non-market playbook built around heavy subsidization and systematic distortion of competition. China follows a predictable strategy across industries: attract foreign investment, coerce tech transfer and steal foreign IP, provide massive subsidies, close domestic markets, and then capture global market share.[8]

The report succinctly outlines the Chinese Communist Party’s playbook:

The first step is to attract foreign investment. (...) China is still trying to do that today with emerging industries, seeking, for example, to attract global biopharmaceutical companies to build facilities in China. China’s second step is to attempt to learn from foreign companies, in part by having them train Chinese executives, scientists, and engineers, and also by forced technology transfer, including through joint ventures. (...) The third step is to support Chinese companies in their efforts to copy and incorporate foreign technology while building up domestic capabilities. (...) The fourth step is to enable Chinese firms to become independent innovators. (...) The Chinese market essentially becomes dominated by Chinese-owned firms. We have seen this an array of industries, including chemicals, telecom equipment, heavy construction equipment, high-speed rail, and renewable energy.[9]

In addition, the CCP integrates technological security into the PRC’s broader national security framework, blurring the line between economic and military statecraft. ITIF’s February 2025 report, “A Policymaker’s Guide to China’s Technology Security Strategy,” describes China’s three-tiered approach to achieve technology security.[10] First, China aims to preserve and fortify its existing competitive advantages, using industrial upgrading, its dense supply chains, and non-market interventions to lock-in global leadership in advanced manufacturing sectors such as electronics, solar, and electric vehicle (EV) batteries Secondly, the PRC is focused on rapidly closing critical technology gaps, especially in chokepoint inputs such as semiconductors, by pouring state resources into import substitution and self-reliance. Third, the Chinese government uses unrestricted access to large pools of data from its population to achieve dominance in emerging technologies, such as AI and other frontier technologies, to shape global standards and outpace competitors over the long term.[11]

How the PRC Uses Non-Market Policies to Gain an Advantage in Strategic Sectors

ITIF’s work since 2020, the year of the POA’s signing, has accumulated substantial evidence of China’s non-market approach to gain an advantage in strategic industries—at the detriment of U.S. and Western companies.

China Supports Its EV Producers to Underprice Competitors in Global Markets

ITIF’s September 2025 report, “Don’t Let Chinese EV Makers Manufacture in the United States,” shows China’s aggressive use of a range of mercantilist practices to advance in the EV market.[12] These non-market interventions include:

▪ Subsidies, totaling over $230 billion between 2009 and 2023, with an estimated $120 billion across 2021–2023 alone.

▪ Forced technology transfer and IP theft. For example, GM’s Volt model could qualify for subsidies only if the company was willing to “transfer the engineering secrets for one of the Volt’s three main technologies to a joint venture in China with a Chinese automaker.”[13] Other examples include forcing the hiring of Chinese engineers to establish a Ford research and development (R&D) facility in China, and Tesla suing a Chinese chip designer for infringing on its IP and stealing its trade secrets, both related to the integrated circuits it uses in its vehicles.[14]

▪ Favoring domestic companies. For example, Made in China 2025 included a local market share target for local producers, and most recently, local authorities have instructed Chinese automakers to avoid foreign semiconductors if at all possible.[15]

China Is Supporting the Overproduction of Polysilicon to Secure Global Dominance

ITIF’s September 2025 report, “China Plans to Dominate a Key Semiconductor Material,” describes the mechanisms by which the PRC’s government incentives, support, and massive overcapacity are flooding the global polysilicon market—a critical chipmaking material.[16] China’s interventions include financial subsidies and incentives, infrastructure and land support, and strategic national plans. China supports polysilicon overproduction and simultaneously helps producers offset the low prices it drives.[17]

The artificial decline in global prices created by the Chinese government’s intervention undermines the viability of U.S. polysilicon producers. While some estimates set the fair market price for polysilicon at $24/kg, Chinese firms are selling at approximately $5/kg, about $1 below their production cost.[18] This dumping cost Chinese producers $40 billion in 2024. This directly impacts U.S. producers. For example, Wolfspeed—a silicon carbide producer headquartered in North Carolina—closed two facilities in the United States in 2024 and postponed an expansion in Germany.

China Helped Huawei to Subsist Despite U.S. Sanctions

ITIF’s October 2025 report, “Backfire: Export Controls Helped Huawei and Hurt U.S. Firms,” describes how Huawei received support from the Chinese government to offset the export controls the United States imposed on the company since 2019.[19] Before these restrictions, Huawei had already received $75 billion in state support since its establishment. After the export controls, the Chinese government’s support for the company was manifested in three main ways:

▪ Favorable financial support to mitigate the effects of the export controls, such as the $15 billion acquisition of Honor, a budget-brand maker and former Huawei subsidiary, by a consortium of private and state-backed investors. This sale provided liquidity to Huawei and helped Honor avoid U.S. export controls.

▪ Direct procurement from state-owned Chinese companies, for example, the 2021 announcement that the Chinese state-owned China Mobile would acquire 60 percent of 5G network station contracts from Huawei.

▪ Continued preferential treatment as a “national champion” for strategic national initiatives, such as receiving an R&D tax incentive for semiconductors, which acts as a de facto subsidy by allowing a 220 percent deduction from the company’s taxable income. (Tax incentives are appropriate tools to facilitate semiconductor-industry competitiveness, but they should be made available equally to any foreign company competing in a country’s marketplace; yet, the subsidies extended to Huawei and other Chinese national champions were unique and exclusive.)

China Confers an Unfair Advantage to Its E-commerce Platforms

China has expanded globally through its international-facing e-commerce platforms, especially Temu, SHEIN, AliExpress, and TikTok Shop. As documented in ITIF’s April 2025 report “How China’s State-Backed E-Commerce Platforms Threaten American Consumers and U.S. Technology Leadership,” China’s government uses a coordinated industrial policy architecture to benefit these platforms through subsidized logistics, tax exemptions, talent recruitment programs, and state-directed financing through cross-border e-commerce pilot zones.[20] These industrial policies are not widely available to foreign competitors and sharply reduce Chinese platforms’ marginal costs of shipping, warehousing, marketing, and customer acquisition. China also deploys regulatory shields that suppress compliance obligations at home, enabling its national champions to achieve lower operating costs than any U.S. or allied-market platform could legally achieve.

These state-backed cost advantages translate into aggressive, predatory penetration of the U.S. market at prices that no market-based firm can realistically match. China’s industrial policy, which aims (as in many other industries) to gain global market share in e-commerce, also pushes its platforms to exploit gaps in U.S. regulations to reduce costs relative to domestic competitors. This raises consumer protection concerns by externalizing product-safety, data-security, and compliance risks onto American consumers, as seen with Temu’s September 2025 penalty for violating the INFORM Consumers Act.[21]

China Failed to Meet Its Commitments Under the Phase One Agreement

The POA included essential commitments by the PRC, as well as provisions related to IP, technology transfer, foreign investment and acquisitions, and currency.[22] The Chinese government has failed to fulfill any of these commitments. This section will outline how China failed to meet its purchasing commitments to reduce the trade imbalance with the United States and present further evidence of the PRC’s tolerance for IP infringement. While the previous section explained how the PRC permits technology transfer and manipulates foreign investments to benefit its EV companies, this section will provide further examples of forced technology transfer. Finally, regarding China’s currency commitments, the U.S. Department of the Treasury has consistently reported that “China provides very limited transparency regarding key features of its exchange rate mechanism, including the policy objectives of its exchange rate management regime and its activities in the offshore RMB market.”[23]

China Failed to Meet Its Purchasing Commitments

China agreed to purchase at least $200 billion worth of goods above a 2017 sectoral baseline across 2020 and 2021, but it only procured a fraction of that amount.[24] The purchasing commitments implied that China should have purchased $32 billion more in agricultural products, $52.4 billion in energy, $77.7 billion in manufactured goods, and $37.9 billion more in services.[25] However, China failed to meet its own purchasing commitments. By 2020, it had already fallen short of this commitment by 40 percent, and by 2021, it had met only 58 percent of the overall target.[26]

Figure 1 shows U.S. exports to China based on the POA purchasing commitments by sector. China focused on expanding its purchases of U.S. agricultural goods, but reached only 83 percent of the agreed amount. Additionally, U.S. exports to China declined by 6 percent during 2020–2021 for goods not covered under the POA.

China Continues to Infringe Upon American Intellectual Property

The PRC’s commitments regarding improving IP protection mechanisms include reforming internal mechanisms to address the U.S. government’s concerns regarding trade secrets, pharmaceutical-related IP, geographical indications, trademarks, and enforcement against pirated and counterfeit goods.[28] However, the PRC’s attempts to steal U.S. technologies persist unabated. In addition to the cases of IP infringement in EV markets described in the previous section, USTR has consistently reported China’s lack of IP enforcement, including Chinese companies and markets in the Notorious Markets List report, classifying China as part of the Priority Watch List in its 2025 Special 301 Report on Intellectual Property Protection and Enforcement, and describing China’s predatory, non-market practices in its annual Report to Congress on China’s WTO Compliance.[29]

China’s IP protection system still lacks transparency and fair treatment for foreign actors in courts. It is inherently difficult to quantify potential bias against foreign-owned firms in China’s IP system due to limited transparency and weak accountability—in many cases, the quality and performance of China’s IP-related institutions cannot be independently verified.[30] China’s refusal to publish a complete record of relevant cases appears intended to impede independent analysis and monitoring of its implementation of IP-related commitments, including those under the POA and other bilateral and multilateral accords.[31]

China treats IP protection as a tool to advance its techno-economic objectives. For example, global anti-suit injunctions (ASIs) in China—which uniquely target foreign companies—help local companies to reduce the cost of foreign technology and patents in support of its industrial policy goals.[32] These ASIs aim to bar foreign courts from hearing disputes that could affect a Chinese court’s ability to set a global licensing rate for patented technologies. In many instances, they have been issued without notice to the affected party and without a subsequent publication, exacerbating already serious transparency concerns—and the Chinese law provides no effective mechanisms to challenge the courts’ assertion of jurisdiction.[33]

In addition, there exists a long history of inequitable patent-granting practices between domestic and foreign filers in China, and allegations that official data is biased because it omits unpublished cases.[34] While, on the surface, Chinese and foreign patent litigants in China have, on average, a similar win rate in court, there are clear differences in win rates regarding strategic technologies. For instance, between 2015 and 2019, foreign pharmaceutical patentees prevailed in only 36 percent of China Patent Reexamination Board (PRB) validity challenges, compared with 59 percent for Chinese applicants.[35] Similar gaps appear across other technology fields, including biotechnology (21 percent for foreign versus 48 percent for Chinese applicants) and environmental technologies (25 percent versus 40 percent, respectively).[36]

In addition to outlining existing evidence, this sub-section presents ITIF’s work on China’s economic espionage and on how Chinese digital platforms facilitate the entry of counterfeits into the U.S. market.

China Deploys Economic Espionage Campaigns Against the United States

In November 2025, ITIF’s report “From Outside Assaults to Insider Threats: Chinese Economic Espionage” outlined China’s campaign of economic espionage against the United States and American companies.[37] The report describes how China’s espionage ecosystem—from state intelligence agencies to nominally private firms—coordinated to steal U.S. industrial and defense technologies. This study highlights how Chinese companies (and academic researchers) operating in the United States serve as knowledge-collection platforms and how China turns engineers and researchers within U.S. firms into conduits for trade secrets.

Chinese actors have used a variety of methods to steal information from American companies.[38] As the report explains, “several Chinese economic espionage cases have involved the persistent penetrations of U.S. companies, rather than individuals’ illegally facilitated changes in career, which are uniquely damaging. They provide opportunities for PRC entities to remain current on developments within the U.S. industry rather than simply acquire increasingly stale stolen material.”[39] Another mechanism used by Chinese actors includes “breaking and entering” techniques, such as China’s use of academic institutions as cover for intelligence activities; active campaigns to hire individuals working for U.S. companies to transfer information from their private sector employers to Chinese entities; and using U.S.-based organizations to recruit expertise from which it then siphons trade secrets and other protected information.[40]

China Facilitates the Flow of Counterfeits Into the United States

As detailed in ITIF’s August 2025 report “How Chinese Online Marketplaces Fuel Counterfeits,” Chinese e-commerce platforms are a primary vector for counterfeit, unsafe, and IP-infringing goods entering the United States.[41] These platforms’ business models—and the industrial policy environment they operate in—fail to effectively enforce counterfeit sales by not adequately identifying and suspending probable counterfeits, allowing them to remain listed and accumulate significant sales. Coupled with China’s reluctance to pursue enforcement against counterfeiters serving foreign markets, this has created a pipeline through which counterfeit cosmetics, apparel, pharmaceuticals, and children’s products enter the United States at scale.[42]

This means that U.S. and other rights holders face widespread infringement with almost no recourse, while U.S. consumers are exposed to serious product safety hazards.[43] China’s government has failed to implement the Phase One IP commitments it made on enforcement against counterfeit goods, namely to “take effective action against e-commerce platforms that fail to take necessary measures against infringement” and to “significantly increase actions to stop the manufacture and distribution of counterfeits with significant health or safety risks.”[44]

China Continues to Force Technology Transfer on Foreign Investors

The POA did not change the direction or intention of the Chinese government’s treatment of foreign investors, as forced technology transfer remains a common practice in advanced industries investing in the Chinese market. USTR’s report “Four-Year Review of China Tech Transfer Section 301” already provides exhaustive evidence that Chinese forced technology transfer and pressures to force joint ventures with local companies persist after signing the POA.[45] This has also been reported by ITIF—in addition with the cases of technology transfer in the EV sector aforementioned.

For example, a 2022 ITIF testimony to the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission documented how China requires cloud-computing operations to be locally controlled.[46] As a result, providers such as Amazon Web Services and Microsoft must operate through Chinese partners, sell services under the Chinese partner’s brand, and share technology and operational know-how as part of these arrangements.[47] By contrast, Chinese cloud providers such as Aliyun—the cloud-services arm of Alibaba—are free to establish data centers in the United States without facing comparable ownership or technology-transfer requirements.

Policy Recommendations

ITIF will soon be releasing a major report that details a comprehensive policy response to China’s ongoing innovation mercantilisma and efforts to expand its global presenence in national power industries. Here, ITIF offers several policy recommendations pertinent to addresing China’s non-compliance with the POA.

The U.S. government should expand its authority to impose Section 301-related tariffs on Chinese goods that continue to benefit from the use of innovation mercantilist practices. USTR already has broad authority, under the ongoing Section 301 action on China’s technology-transfer and IP practices, to maintain and modify tariffs in response to China’s continued non-market behavior.[48] The current Section 301 investigation into China’s commitments under the POA would allow the U.S. government to impose a broader set of tariffs, including all the manufacturing products that are detailed in the agreement’s purchasing commitments. The scope of the current investigation should allow expanding the authority to impose tariffs on all Chinese imports beneffiting from unfair trade practices—which would be critical to improving the U.S. government’s negotiating position for future revisions to the trade deal with China.

Regarding controls on imports of Chinese goods benefitting from unfair trade practices, the U.S. government should seek to expand its authority through executive and Congressional action to:

▪ Ban importing goods from Chinese companies on the Entity List. Today, it is possible to purchase goods from the Chinese telecommunications company Huawei via resellers, including telecommunication equipment for private use, despite the company being listed in the Entity List since 2019. The presence of a company on the Entity List reflects the U.S. government’s view that it has been involved in activities contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States, and exporting goods or technologies to the company is restricted. USTR should close this loophole and fully ban these companies from the U.S. market.

▪ Ban all imports and U.S. presence of companies that have been involved in systematic or deliberate theft of American IP. While legislative action is needed to strengthen Section 337 of the Tariff Act—so the U.S. International Trade Commission (USITC) can more systematically exclude imports from China that benefit from unfair practices, including IP theft and other innovation mercantilist tools—the U.S. government already has other levers it can use against offending firms, such as anti-dumping and countervailing duty cases that raise tariffs on unfairly traded goods and, in appropriate circumstances, financial sanctions administered by the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control that can cut off access to U.S. dollar transactions. Where warranted, he U.S. government should explore using Section 301 authorities to impose broader import restrictions.

▪ Collaborate with like-minded allied nations to craft “a bill of particulars” that comprehensively enumerates China’s unfair trade practices impacting especially allied countries’ advanced industry sectors.[49]

▪ Expand efforts to forge a “Seven Eyes”-like alliance among key allies to exchange information about China’s industrial espionage activities impacting allied countries’ advanced industry sectors.

▪ Work with allied countries to have them implement Section 337-like legislation that would likewise permit them to wholesale block imports from Chinese companies that consistently use unfair trade practices.

▪ Use Section 301 authorities to enforce “immediate reciprocity.” USTR should consider using the 301 import control powers to address Chinese sectors that restrict or limit access for foreign competitors. A clear example of this is digital platforms for social media, where U.S. companies are barred from entering the Chinese market. If there are clear instances where U.S. firms are being wholesale blocked from competing in China’s market, then the United States should impose the same conditions on Chinese firms that would compete in the U.S. market.

▪ Utilize existing Treasury Department authorities to sanction Chinese companies benefitting from stolen IP or coerced technology transfer. Chinese firms that are stealing IP should be banned from accessing the U.S. banking and financial system.[50]

Additional policy measures for consideration.

▪ Ramp up efforts to limit Chinese cyber-IP theft and espionage. More needs to be done to limit Chinese IP theft. The next administration should work with Congress to pass legislation increasing criminal penalties for such actions. Its next budget should include a sizeable increase for the FBI’s Office of Commercial Counterintelligence.[51]

▪ Increase federal efforts to disrupt the global flow of counterfeits. Chinese counterfeit goods jeopardize U.S. consumer safety, erode public confidence, reduce U.S. jobs, and unfairly support Chinese economic growth. The government unfortunately struggles to stop many counterfeit shipments. To address this problem, the next administration should increase the Customs and Border Protection budget and appoint a director who will collaborate with private-sector stakeholders, including brand sellers, online marketplaces, and shippers, to establish real-time information sharing and analytics about potential counterfeit shipments that would allow them to better detect and seize more imported counterfeits.

▪ Increase criminal penalties for techno-economic espionage committed against U.S. firms. For too long, economic espionage has been treated as simply a commercial crime as opposed to a national security crime. With China laser focused on stealing as much core advanced technology information and knowledge as possible from the United States in order to gain global leadership and use in its civil-military fusion, it’s time for that to end.[52]

▪ Better prosecute trade crime, especially transshipment and misclassification. Chinese companies are masters at getting around trade rules, including exporting products to a country for transshipment to the United States as a way to circumvent U.S. tariffs. Often the amount of value added contributed in the third country is de minimis. Yet, this is seldom prosecuted. Congress should pass and fully fund the Protecting American Industry and International Trade Crimes Act that, among other elements, expands DOJ resources to prosecute trade crime.[53]

▪ Assess the impact of foreign unfair trade practices, especially China’s, on the long-term health of the U.S. industrial base. China’s mercantilist trade practices have contributed substantially to a hollowing out of the U.S. manufacturing base, including the U.S. defense industrial base. For this reason, ITIF supports the “America First Trade Policy’s” call for the secretaries of Commerce and Defense to “conduct a full economic and security review of the United States’ industrial and manufacturing base to assess whether it is necessary to initiate investigations to adjust imports that threaten the national security of the United States.”[54]

In a marketplace where range is one of the most significant factors influencing consumers, battery health is a major concern.

The battery is the single most valuable component in the vehicle, often representing 30-40% of the total manufacturing cost. That makes its long-term health an important part of the ownership equation. Where internal-combustion components tend to degrade gradually and predictably, lithium-ion cells follow chemical aging pathways that are heavily influenced by a myriad of variables. Considerations like charging habits, thermal exposure, cell chemistry, and vehicle-level energy management all influence cell capacity retention, and, therefore, car value.

High-voltage fast charging, for example, exposes cells to elevated temperatures and higher current densities, which can cause wear in some chemistries. Conversely, vehicles with conservative charging algorithms and liquid cooling tend to preserve capacity far more effectively over time.

User behavior and environment also impact cell life. That’s why two vehicles with the same odometer reading can have dramatically different states of health. A pack that has spent years in a mild climate, routinely charged between 20% and 80%, will age very differently from one that is repeatedly fast-charged to 100% in extreme heat or cold.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltb299798942522069/blt85bc1d52d5beda31/674fc18c351f9a3c9ba42086/22478_2025_Niro_EV.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-12-01 11:05:11.134787

Americans bought 438,500 electric cars and trucks in the third quarter, as drivers raced to grab federal incentives before they expired Sept. 30.

Those transactions, the highest number in a single quarter, comprised 11% of all new car sales, eclipsing the previous high point of 8.7%, according to Cox Automotive, a services and technology company.

A crowd of more affordable cars next year could help maintain the momentum, but analysts expect EV transactions to dip in the months ahead without federal tax credits.

Stephanie Valdez Streaty, Cox Director of Industry Insights, said in a report EVs could account for one quarter of all new US car sales by 2030. That’s “well short of the 50% once envisioned, but certainly moving out of the ‘niche’ category.”

The sales tally underscores a tricky dynamic for auto executives and clean-air advocates: Millions of Americans want electric vehicles, but relatively high prices remain a speed bump to adoption.

Tesla Inc. still dominates the US market for EVs and managed a small sales gain in the recent quarter after months of skidding results. However, a crowd of rivals is closing the gap quickly, shrinking Tesla’s share of the EV pie to 41% from 80% four years ago.

General Motors Co., in particular, is gaining electric speed. The company captured 15% of EV sales in the quarter, led by its new Chevrolet Equinox, the third best-selling battery-powered machine. That’s up from 10% in the year-earlier period.

Nearly half of US EV purchases in the first half of the year were made without any federal incentive, according to BloombergNEF. And there are now at least 11 EVs in the US with starting prices below that of the average car purchase. Chevrolet’s Equinox can be had for about $35,000, for example, and the brand just released a new version of its Bolt with a price tag of $29,000.

Emily Almaer, a mother of three in Boulder, Colo, is paying $250 a month for the Volkswagen ID.4 she picked up in August. At least three of her friends also recently ponied up for EVs: another Volkswagen, a Nissan Leaf and a Hyundai Ioniq 9.

“You look at some of these [monthly payments],” her husband, Dion Almaer, said, “and it’s like ‘Wait, this is like one family meal out.’”

The road ahead for EVs, however, looks rocky, at least for a little while. Without federal credits, BloombergNEF forecasts 27% of the US market will be electric by 2030, down from the 48% share it estimated a year ago. In the current quarter, S&P Global expects EVs to comprise less than 7% of new car sales.

“The affordability issue is going to be exacerbated,” said Peter Nagle, an associate director at S&P. “It’s really going to be a sink or swim moment.”

Meanwhile, the market for used EVs is booming and more affordable EV models are heading to production. BloombergNEF expects at least nine new electric cars and trucks priced below $40,000 in the next three years.

Volvo Car AB Chief Executive Officer and President Hakan Samuelsson said his company will take a “huge step” next year in offering EVs with longer driving ranges and lower prices.

“The industry will be electric — there’s no turning back,” he told Bloomberg recently. “It may take a bit longer in some regions, but the direction is clear.”

The genesis of early farming is even thought to have resulted from a shift in seasonal conditions that favored regular planting and harvesting intervals after the last ice age.

In the modern era, the necessity to adapt has led to expansive land use, fertilization, irrigation, and other agricultural routines—powered primarily by combusted carbon and freshwater extractions—to suit local environmental conditions and meet demands of growing populations. These practices have been a boon to food supplies, but they have also contributed to many of today’s climatic and environmental challenges.

Recognition of global crises with respect to climate change and biodiversity has motivated landmark international agreements such as the Paris Agreement and the Global Biodiversity Framework. The Paris Agreement legally binds participating nations to implement land use methods that mitigate emissions and actively remove carbon from the atmosphere.

One such set of modified land management practices, known collectively as climate-smart agriculture [U.S. Department of Agriculture, 2025], is lauded as a pragmatic, low-barrier pathway to manage climate change through nature-based atmospheric carbon removal and avoided emissions (related to both land use and livestock). However, these practices have primarily been studied in small, controlled experiments, not at the extent needed to verify their effectiveness—and help motivate their adoption—on a large scale.

Recently, soil carbon experts explored the utility of applying causal approaches to quantify soil carbon accrual and avoided emissions from large-scale land management interventions and to address concerns and uncertainties that are slowing their uptake [Bradford et al., 2025a]. Such approaches have long been applied in other contexts to measure and verify treatment efficacy. In particular, methods in medical science for studying vaccine efficacy broadly offer important insights for assessing climate-smart applications.

Accounting for Carbon

Climate-smart agriculture includes a variety of management practices such as cover cropping (planting noncash crops on otherwise fallow land), reducing or eliminating soil tilling, and diversifying crops. These applications can offer various cobenefits, including increased yields; greater soil water holding capacity; improved soil microbiomes; reduced erosion and runoff; enhanced control of pests, disease, and weeds; and greater soil nutrient availability that reduces the need for chemical fertilizers [U.S. Department of Agriculture, 2025].

Such benefits are linked to the idea that the applications either avoid losses or improve gains in soil organic matter. But can we measure how much they really help?

To account for carbon lost, gained, or stored in agricultural land, soil organic matter is typically measured by elemental analysis of soil samples in a laboratory. Amounts of carbon stored are determined by tracking changes in soil carbon stocks over time. Comparing results following the application of climate-smart agriculture approaches with those following business-as-usual practices provides a measure of the approaches’ effectiveness for carbon management.

Assuming this carbon accounting reveals increased soil carbon stocks, agricultural projects implementing these approaches can be considered natural climate solutions, which are valued in the voluntary carbon market for their carbon offset and removal power. For example, one project developer selling carbon credits since 2022 recently reported that their efforts have so far stored nearly 1 million tons of soil carbon in U.S. farmlands. Further, across farms in four U.S. states, the combined use of three climate-smart agriculture techniques—no tillage, cover cropping, and crop rotation of corn and soybeans—is claimed to have resulted in a shift to carbon gains from soil carbon loss using conventional practices [U.S. Department of Agriculture, 2025].

Limited Evidence, Low Adoption

Despite claims about the successes of climate-smart agricultural practices, adoption remains low. Although no-till and reduced-till methods have been implemented on more than half of all U.S. soybean, corn, and sorghum fields, cover cropping is used across less than 5% of the country’s agricultural lands.

A multitude of social, cultural, and economic factors—along with questions about the viability for meaningful climate change mitigation—contribute to the limited adoption of some climate-smart practices [Prokopy et al., 2019; Eagle et al., 2022]. However, if robust data showing that they lead to widespread yield increases, cost reductions, and climate benefits were available, they might be more widely adopted by growers.

Presently, most evidence supporting the benefits of climate-smart agriculture for carbon management relies on a limited set of small-plot experimental trials and projected outcomes derived from applying process-based biogeochemical models. Public and private investment in studies aimed at quantifying the practices’ efficacy through measurement, monitoring, reporting, and verification (MMRV) at scales of real-world commercial agriculture has been inhibited by the assumption that soils vary too much to measure treatment effects feasibly [Poeplau et al., 2022].

This assumption is driven by the fact that regional and national soil carbon inventories reveal substantial variation in soil carbon contents at scales within individual fields (meters to tens of meters) and between fields (kilometers to tens of kilometers)—variation that is thought to preclude detections of how agricultural practices affect carbon stocks [Bradford et al., 2023]. Yet this variability can be overcome by scaling up field-level data to multifield scales focused on understanding the average effect of interventions.

What could this scaling look like, and what cues from other fields can we use to make progress?

Adapting Methods from Medical Research

Causal approaches are used regularly in health sciences, including in vaccine trials. In later-stage trials, vaccine efficacy is quantified under conditions approximating real-world delivery by measuring the differences in the health responses of people who receive the vaccine and those who do not.

Importantly, such real-world trials occur only after there is enough experimental evidence—typically from controlled laboratory experiments and small-scale clinical trials—of underlying mechanisms indicating the likelihood of broad, meaningful positive effects and minimal negative effects of the vaccine. Public health scientists use these large-scale clinical intervention-style experiments (or observational studies) to account for factors such as varied exposure risks and preexisting conditions that can modify real-world vaccine efficacy compared with efficacy under controlled conditions.

Earth scientists can take direction from such trials. Adapting this experiment structure for soil science research would allow project developers, scientists, land managers, and policymakers to assess the ability of climate-smart agricultural practices to store carbon and reduce emissions across real fields and farms. It would also better inform meaningful climate action policy initiatives.

A base of highly controlled small-scale experiments—typically conducted in plots operated by researchers—already exists that suggests the carbon benefits of improved agricultural practices under highly controlled conditions. What is missing are the large-scale intervention studies sampling soil carbon in fields that receive a climate-smart treatment (e.g., no till or reduced till, crop rotation, cover cropping) versus those that are conventionally managed [Bradford et al., 2025b].

Such studies must be undertaken with appropriate design principles to confirm whether treatment interventions cause measured carbon gains and to focus on the external validity of the experiments. In the case of climate-smart agriculture, “external validity” refers to the extent to which a study’s results are applicable to other fields receiving similar management interventions. Achieving external validity necessitates sustained observation of realistic intervention behaviors on working commercial farms and on well-defined and preserved control fields, repetition of experiments at a variety of sites, and quantification of average outcomes from interventions across fields rather than for individual fields.

New research suggests that empirical measure-and-remeasure projects are scientifically feasible at regional agricultural scales using current best practices for soil sampling and carbon analysis [Potash et al., 2025; Bradford et al., 2023]. Potash et al. [2025], for example, simulated a randomized-controlled trial for intervention projects across hundreds to thousands of fields, incorporating known variations in soil carbon stocks and measurement errors. The results showed that such projects can reliably estimate the effects of the treatments applied.

Using causal empirical approaches can complement, rather than compete with, the development of other approaches for MMRV of carbon storage and emissions. Approaches using satellite and airborne remote sensing may, for example, enable more efficient scaling of climate mitigation projects, albeit only if they are first validated against causal empirical data.

Empirical causal studies at the regional scales of commercial agricultural practices should thus be the gold standard of evidence for evaluating the effectiveness of climate-smart approaches. Data from these experiments will provide a rigorous basis for independent validation of established and emerging digital- and model-based approaches for soil carbon MMRV. They will also build confidence that adopting climate-smart practices really does result in mitigation of carbon emissions and climate change under real-world conditions.

Morgan chimes in Texas Roadhouse collected back-to-back softball titles, including an undefeated season, over the past four years.","Texas Roadhouse founder Kent Taylor had a flair for testing those he believed in. He was a factfinder. He’d share books, poll employees on their contemporaries, and drop hints about what he might be considering. But what Taylor concluded was often a mystery.

Before his passing in March 2021, when Taylor took his own life following a battle with post-COVID-19 symptoms, including severe tinnitus, he had started to read books on founders and their leadership transitions. Namely, three in particular—the stories behind Home Depot, Chick-fil-A founder Truett Cathy, and “My Father’s Business,” which gets into the change at Dollar General.

Travis Doster, Texas Roadhouse’s chief communications officer, recalls Taylor one day asking him to send these books to a rising executive in Jerry Morgan, who was named president in mid-December 2020. He didn’t want Morgan to know why he was receiving them or be tipped off his boss might be paying attention. “Because when I come to town,” Doster says of Taylor’s instructions, “I’m going to switch books with him.”

“I immediately called Jerry and told him to buy a highlighter and write in the book,” Doster adds with a laugh.

Taylor loved to jot notes in pencil and blue erasable pen on graph paper. If you’re wondering if those relic pens are still easily found, his longtime assistant, Shelly McGowen, purchased “like 10,000 of them” years ago, Doster says. Employees often bantered of Taylor’s preference, “nothing says permanent decisions like an erasable pen.”

What Taylor was hoping to uncover, though, was how Morgan would process information and how much he’d study. He had inclinations the company’s 2001 Managing Partner of the Year, who rose to regional market partner in 2015, overseeing more than 120 Texas Roadhouses in 14 states, was the right person for a weighty job—his successor.

It’ll soon be coming on five years since Morgan became just that. Like others, he had a feeling Taylor was trying to telegraph the plan without fully saying it. The conversation was going on, in one respect or another, Morgan says, for a few years. He knew the store side. There was little doubt there, and Taylor understood operators were comfortable with that kind of hands-on resume.

Morgan was one of Taylor’s famed “crazies,” or store leaders who broke convention at times to make sales happen. Taylor boasted a rebellious spirit himself, going back to Bennigan’s in the 1980s and even KFC, where he used to tell stories of tweaking recipes and selling bottled water when his bosses asked him not to.

Morgan worked at Texas Roadhouse for 25 years and was known to spend hours weighing his store’s steaks and tasting each menu item.

He landed in Louisville, Kentucky, on December 17, 2020, and was announced publicly as president, donning a baseball cap and a three-quarter Texas Roadhouse zip-up.

Taylor didn’t offer Morgan any timeline or assurances. He was there to learn how corporate connected with unit-level performance; to host one-on-ones, and get to know leaders through various functions.

“I knew how to make a restaurant open, operate, and close quality shifts, and to hire great people and partners,” Morgan says. “But how did the other side work? I had made numerous trips over the years, but I didn’t know how it all came together.”

The learning period lasted four months. When Taylor passed, there was a memorial service, a Founder’s Day to ideate, museum to plan, statue to erect, and other theater-of-grief tasks that have a way of pausing time. Taylor had led Texas Roadhouse for 28-and-a-half years. Morgan says many folks, himself included, saw Taylor as the Norman Brinker of our time. “The one guy who could really get a chain to be highly successful and was still leading it,” he says. “And so, we just saw Kent and revered him in that manner.”

Naturally, there was a stretch of days and weeks trying to digest events and, for Morgan, accept responsibility. On this end, Taylor made his instructions clearer than usual.

He tore out a legal sheet piece of paper and wrote, in blue ink, Jerry Morgan (CEO). Taylor, 65 years old at the time, signed and dated it 3-18-2021—the day he died.

McGowen had the sheet framed and, to this day, Morgan keeps it in his office as a reminder of his stewardship.

He recalls sitting in meetings during emotionally charged days and leaders asking, “is a decision made?”

“OK, well, now who’s going to present it to Kent?”

Morgan realized everyone needed time. The process at Texas Roadhouse was so ingrained that habits had to unwind. So Morgan asked Doster to help him draft a “promise letter.”

The company-wide communication was, Morgan says, him “really accepting the job” and assuming the task of leading one of the world’s most successful casual-dining chains.

“When I looked at that whole piece of it, he gave me the job, but the day I wrote the letter and made a promise to the company was when I accepted the responsibility to be their leader,” he says. “And from that moment, I just moved forward.”

A leader in the making, and learning on the job

Growing up in Sarasota, Florida, Morgan was a 6-foot, 145-pound tight end/defensive lineman who learned a couple of early lessons before he reached his 20s: One, he was more interested in football than anything else, and, secondly, he also needed half a foot and another 50 pounds to compete. So, he was realistic.

One thing Morgan didn’t want to do, however, was get into restaurants or grocery stores. He felt the sectors didn’t garner the respect they deserved, and he wouldn’t, either, if he made it a career. Morgan received his first taste of retail and customer service in the garden center of now-defunct discount department store Woolco. After, he moved to Houston, Texas, to join his dad and uncle. He worked for Telesphere, a company installing long-distance dialers in hotels across America. Morgan did so for a couple of years until his uncle, a local lawyer, told him a story. He was doing legal work for an operator who owned 10 McDonald’s and “couldn’t believe how much money this guy was making.” He went and got a franchise partnership and bought two Burger Kings in Waco, Texas, and asked Morgan to come along. Morgan cleared the idea with his dad.

What he found was restaurants didn’t feel all that different from sports. He enjoyed the frenetic shifts, teamwork, and reality silver spoons aren’t handed out for free in this business. The ladder to success is accessible to anybody willing to work hard enough and grab it.

Restaurants fit the way Morgan viewed success and how he’d eventually frame his plans for Texas Roadhouse.

He talks today about “running one store, one market, one region, one company.” The philosophies don’t change all that much stop-to-stop. You gather information. You make a decision. And you try to get buy-in along the way.

It’s “been a heck of a journey” honing that mindset at Texas Roadhouse.

“Our sales have been incredible. The respect that we’ve received as an organization has just been unbelievable,” Morgan says. “When people say to me Kent Taylor would be very proud of not only what I’ve done, but what this company has done in the last five years, it does make it worth it to me.”

How Morgan kept Texas Roadhouse rolling and built on Taylor’s legacy unfolded quite differently in approach. That, too, is something Taylor appeared to recognize as a strength in Morgan and knew operators would respect beyond his sales record.

Morgan refers to himself not as a CEO, but as a “head coach.” He sees his job as ensuring the layers of Texas Roadhouse function at a high level through collaboration and communication.

Taylor, in his way, never specifically told Morgan why he thought he had the makeup to be his successor. He did share with Morgan he was a likeable leader and someone who worked well with others. Taylor, on the other hand, was an enigmatic, introverted CEO who kept colleagues on their toes. He was brilliant and steadfast, and always consumer and operator centric. Taylor would wait in line to eat at Texas Roadhouse and drove Chevy Suburbans stuffed with clutter, from architectural plans to a Santa suit.

But he admittedly had to develop a persona, “Bubba,” to play a certain character when it came to front-facing duties. He’d wear costumes, wigs, cowboy hats—all to put on a mask and do the things he was least comfortable doing.

Morgan says pundits and fans liked to say, “Kent Taylor is Texas Roadhouse.” Yet if you asked Taylor, he’d tell you it was about partners and “the Roadie nation,” a term the company uses to describe fanatics.

Morgan himself was a “Roadie” and somebody who could bridge the external and operational corners of running the company. He was respected because he got results, but also outward and more of a people-person than Taylor, who enjoyed yearly three-month skiing trips and was often on the road, growing the company and making deals.

Morgan managed the first Texas Roadhouse in Texas—Grand Prairie—that opened in 1997 and historically was one of the chain’s top performers. Morgan was recruited by Steve Ortiz, who knew Taylor from Bennigan’s and later rose to COO. Morgan asked Ortiz if Taylor was, indeed, someone you wanted to get into business with. Ortiz didn’t hesitate, and this path began.

“At each level, the results that you get create respect,” Morgan says. “And then, what do you do with that respect? Do you get arrogant, or do you get humble and go back to work?”

Taylor had begun to observe a sturdiness in Morgan and, sort of, trickled out hints. The day Ortiz retired, Taylor called Morgan and informed him there was a name and envelope in his desk. He told him, “The name changed that day.” Taylor didn’t say it was now “Jerry Morgan;” he just let him know it could be. About eight years later when then-president Scott Colosi retired, Morgan received another call.

“And he said, ‘the name in that desk is different.’ So, he was telling me that maybe he saw me as that kind of leader,” Morgan says. “And I responded, ‘that’s really cool. Thank you, sir. I appreciate it. And I’m going to go back to work.’”

In the months ahead, Taylor rang “every single person in the company” and asked them what it was like working for Morgan. He’d pose another question—“give me three names who should replace me.” Once more, Taylor never shared with anybody what he heard back. “At one point, he did say, it was a pretty obvious choice,” Morgan says.

For the reticent Taylor, it was a resounding endorsement.

Texas Roadhouse’s next era

Morgan has adjusted over the years from accepting Taylor’s torch to carrying it to understanding how he might do so in his own style.

It comes back to Morgan’s “coaching mentality.” He made sure he understood people’s jobs, whether it was training, marketing, or legal. Morgan says his position has always been about trusting and inspiring people and holding them accountable. The latter is a place, he notes, where high-leadership executives often struggle. It’s the difference between executing in the trenches and holding others to that standard.

Firstly, though, not a morning arrives where Morgan doesn’t consider the mission, values, and purpose of Texas Roadhouse. Everything the company does today builds on what Taylor worked to nurture. Morgan seeks out leaders who are in it for Texas Roadhouse.

His first assessment came with certified counselor G. Dan Lumpkin. The coaching expert provided a predictive index with a 17-page report. Morgan had to answer 2,000 questions and Lumpkin evaluated his results against other CEOs.

It claimed Morgan was “bold, aggressive, and decisive.”

“I said, I’m good with that,” Morgan says.

“The bottom line is, Kent always told me, you’re never going to make everybody happy. Make the decision and move forward. And if it’s wrong, change it,” Morgan adds.

Texas Roadhouse lives through a “MVP” lens: “Mission. Values. Purpose.”

Morgan, illustrating how the operator gene never quite leaves you, says the company owes its employees a quality shift, every day. It owes guests top-end experience and value they can trust. And it owes shareholders the ability to run a solid business.

On that final point, Morgan took over a chain that took its pandemic lumps and came out firing.

In the week ending March 3, Texas Roadhouse units averaged weekly sales of $118,512. Of that, only $9,115 came outside the four walls. By March 24, those numbers were $29,432 and $25,938, respectively. And then, Texas Roadhouse figured things out, leveraging ideas of managing partners and serving a grateful customer.

Within a week, Texas Roadhouse jolted to-go sales to $41,892, a number that would rise into the high $50,000, low $60,000 range by late April.

In Q2 of 2025, as things have settled and continued to widen, Texas Roadhouse posted same-store sales of 5.8 percent for a two-year stack of 15.1 percent during a time when many restaurant peers are scratching to stay above the line. Average weekly sales were $167,350, of which $22,243 stemmed from to-go sales.

Morgan in October 2024 rang the closing bell to mark the brand’s 20th anniversary as a publicly traded company. It was a reflective moment remembering when Taylor and the chain’s mascot, Andy the Armadillo, opened the Nasdaq Stock Exchange on October 5, 2004. Texas Roadhouse had roughly 174 stores and 10,000 employees.

When Morgan got up there, the company had swelled to nearly 775 stores (there were 797 this past quarter) and 100,000 workers spread across three concepts—fast casual Jaggers and burger and pizza brand Bubba’s 33 included. It generated more than $5.373 billion in revenue in 2024, up 16 percent, year-over-year.

And regarding its stock, Texas Roadhouse traded for $11.50 on October 8 of that opening run. More recently, it was at $173 in mid-October 2025.

The company was a $2 billion enterprise in 2017, doubled to $4.014 billion over the next five years, and is well on its way to $8 billion over the next decade, as Morgan outlined last year.

All that success, he adds, has led to a lot of back-patting for Texas Roadhouse. Among his duties, he considers ensuring the brand never gets comfortable a key one.

Morgan believes Texas Roadhouse will avoid complacency as long as it remains committed to a larger vision. He’s regularly faced with decisions that affect 100,000 employees or 250 million guests. “When you look at it, you ask, are you making a decision that’s great for your employees? Are you making a decision that’s great for your guests? Or are you making a decision that’s great for the organization? If you can get all three of those boxes checked, then you’re in great shape,” Morgan says.

Embracing the “rowdy” and staying ahead

It’s likely Taylor saw in Morgan somebody who would never let the brand drift. One thing about Texas Roadhouse is it hasn’t suffered for identity, no matter what’s going on macro-wise. Taylor liked to rail against norms on earnings calls and answer complicated investor questions with short and direct quips. Why is the brand winning? Perhaps it has something to do with having fully staffed restaurants. Why aren’t you getting into delivery? Let other chains serve guests cold steaks.

Morgan, of course, lived this mantra each shift as an operator. The music is loud. There’s energy in restaurants. Morgan says the No. 1 thing guests tell Texas Roadhouse is to turn the volume down. But those who intimately know the brand also understand it’s a non-negotiable and a reason the whole thing works. Being able to separate the vocal minority from what matters is something that takes a Texas Roadhouse lifer to grasp.

Or, in Morgan’s words, “we have to believe that’s something that’s really important to our business.”

The same is true of free peanuts and the basket of bread and cinnamon butter. Morgan remarks, even before steak, customers talk about those two traits. Everywhere he goes, he says, on a plane, for instance, if Morgan is wearing a Texas Roadhouse logo somebody will tell him to bring the rolls before he gets onboard.

“We love that,” Morgan says.

The secret to Texas Roadhouse, so to speak, has never been difficult to place. It stays true to its principles—“Legendary Food and Legendary Service” —and compounds those hallmarks with running great restaurants. The managing partner model was one Taylor implemented because he thought operators would compete for success and hold to his ideals (he also needed the financial uplift). Operators spend $25,000—the first forked up $30,000—sign a multi-year contract, and get 10 percent of the store’s bottom line in addition to their salary.

These partners provide the foundation for Texas Roadhouse. Morgan and management conduct a fall tour to tap their ingenuity and check in. They help with pricing decisions, market observations, and, as Morgan proved, help build the pipeline from the inside out, with leaders who breathe Texas Roadhouse’s ethos. Doster says Morgan has a superpower for “listening to learn, not listening to respond.”

Operators have an hour to ask any question they want. “I just don’t think you can underestimate the power of that partnership with our operators,” Doster says.

Morgan says he’s proud of how the company and organization came together following Taylor’s passing and what’s unfurled since. “When you go through a tragic loss, you can either heal as a company or you can break apart,” he says. “You can start pointing fingers at each other. For us to all come together and heal and continue to focus on providing Legendary Food and Legendary Service, running great restaurants, and living our mission and our values and our purpose, and growing as a company, it’s meant everything.”

Staying the course and charting a new one

The first thing Texas Roadhouse did when it started to climb out of the pandemic was get staffed. It spent time investing in headcount, store wise and management, and Morgan feels it’s paid dividends as sales slope upward.

Texas Roadhouse has steadied the rampant turnover of post-COVID life and produced churn rates, Morgan says, at industry lows. That’s leading to more productive employees who, when they stay, signal they’re making money and having fun, he explains.

Guests in turn receive the experience and consistency expected of Texas Roadhouse. Even as prices hiked industry-wide, the brand never skimped on portions or service. “If I’m charging you more, wouldn’t you expect a little bit better food or better service?” Morgan says.

“We’ve never changed any of our recipes. We’re just trying to continue to deliver a great experience at a value price,” he adds. “You can spend a lot of money at Texas Roadhouse. But there’s also a value portion of the menu that’s always been there that I think protects us. We want to be very careful about that.”

Plainly, through all the industry’s value turmoil, Texas Roadhouse’s top-line growth confirms to Morgan people view the brand as a “good deal.” And that boils down to the aforementioned levers of trust, service, consistency, and never losing sight of what customers need—answers that come from managing partners making decisions on the ground level.

Along these lines, however, Morgan says, Texas Roadhouse wants to talk about staying true to itself while also evolving. Even going back a decade, the chain was considering pay-at-the-table, for example. It eventually tried to let diners use phones or Apple Pay, etc., yet it never took hold.

Then, in 2022, the company partnered with Ziosk on “Roadhouse Pay” tablets that allow customers to check out when they’re ready. Immediately, Morgan says, Texas Roadhouse saw an 80 percent response. Nearly 90 percent of guests use them today. Customers can’t reorder apps or drinks—it’s strictly a convenience play so people can pay on their own terms.

The industry in those days was sorting through a torrent of post-COVID technology. Brands hurried to open access and had begun to try and decode the options. A side effect was employees and leaders gained exposure.

Morgan says Texas Roadhouse started to have people come over from other chains who had used a lot of the options at hand. One was digital kitchen technology, or KDS. The company tried it first at Jaggers and Bubba’s. Texas Roadhouse was a more difficult concept because it was so oriented, Morgan says, onto tickets and the old style. And it was successful doing so.

“But we also knew we had to try to evolve,” he says.

Texas Roadhouse customized an option and put it in a restaurant. It was a success. The next 10 worked as well. And soon, the word got out and operators wanted in. So, the company laid out a three-year plan to update every restaurant, which should happen by year’s end.

While still relatively early, Morgan said learnings stem from being more organized. The kitchen is calmer since cooks don’t have to hear paper being pulled and see tickets everywhere. The bump screen allows them to focus on orders in front of them versus watching the rail of dozens of tickets stack up, which can be intimidating at times.

“It’s been a huge win for us,” Morgan says.

Texas Roadhouse has gotten better at takeout (still no delivery). It’s installed bump outs where sensible and improved its approach. It’s also worked on the mobile app and integrated a waitlist where customers can put their name down. That, Morgan says, has been a game-changer.

The brand has begun to consider handheld tablet ordering versus a server running over to a point-of-sale as well.

But overall, Texas Roadhouse wants technology to complement experience and help it become more efficient. It won’t replace or change the company’s DNA, Morgan says.

And that brings him back to what’s still to come. There’s growth on several fronts going into 2026, whether it’s the core Texas Roadhouse brand, Jaggers, or Bubba’s 33—the latter of which has 200-store ambitions (there were 53 in Q2). Jaggers touted 15 units and is ramping up franchising. It’s a fast casual, employees like to picture, created from Taylor driving one day with his grandchildren and getting annoyed they wanted to eat different things. The result being a mashup of burgers, chicken, salads, shakes, and more. A Jaggers in Lexington, Kentucky, earlier this year marked the 800th systemwide opening for the company.

As Texas Roadhouse debuts stores, across the portfolio, Morgan says he won’t lose sight of the soul the brand was founded on. Restaurants get to teach people soft skills and show them how to lead in ways other sectors simply cannot, he notes. Plus, you get to run a business and control your destiny, just as Taylor did. “And I think that’s the part when you think about this generation that’s coming up that’s very entrepreneurial driven, our company is built off that entrepreneurial spirit,” Morgan says. “You get to be an owner-operator, but you have responsibilities to the company. But to me, it’s always been about how do we create an environment where our employees love to work? That is what defines you as a leader.”

So what kind of leader has Morgan grown into, five years in? Doster says Taylor was not a “rah-rah” guy or someone who was overly approachable. He was quiet and earned respect through vision and action. Morgan does that, too, but he has a knack for bringing folks together.

He sits in the café and dines with employees. And one of the first things Morgan did was start a softball team. “Imagine another company right now where you just started at Roadhouse and you may work in IT or you work in purchasing, and you’re on the team with the CEO,” Doster says.

Morgan chimes in Texas Roadhouse collected back-to-back softball titles, including an undefeated season, over the past four years.

“I’m a part of Roadie Nation, too,” Morgan says. “And I’ve got a job to do.”",https://www.fsrmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/TexasRoadhouseJerry.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 11:06:57.303755
,EVs,2025-12-01 14:32:17+00:00,Stacker,How EVs can fix the grid and lower your electric bill | Stacker,Matt Simon for Grist,,,,,https://stacker.com/stories/transportation/how-evs-can-fix-grid-and-lower-your-electric-bill,"Depending on whom you’re asking, renewable energy and electric vehicles will either destroy the grid or save it.
Until now, we’ve been customers of utilities — with power flowing one way to homes — but more and more we’ll be active participants in the grid, sending extra battery power the other way.
“There’s more energy capacity deployed today in electric vehicle batteries on the road in the U.S. than in all stationary batteries combined,” Rauscher added.
At the same time, ever more data centers are devouring ever more power and stressing the grid to its limits.
“I fundamentally believe that bidirectional electric vehicles are going to be something that no one’s ever heard of, until suddenly everyone has it,” Rauscher said.","Depending on whom you’re asking, renewable energy and electric vehicles will either destroy the grid or save it. The sun doesn’t always shine and the wind doesn’t always blow, true enough, while a gas-fired power plant can generate electricity any time. That supposed precarity of renewables will get even shakier, critics argue, as Americans ditch conventional vehicles for electric ones, which will draw ever more power from an already strained grid.

Luckily, that’s not a realistic scenario because of what renewables and EVs have in common: giant batteries. Solar and wind farms are plugging into huge banks of them to store energy to use as needed, fixing their intermittency challenge, Grist reports. (Engineers are turning Earth itself into an even bigger battery.) And a growing number of cars with cords feature vehicle-to-grid technology, or V2G, also known as bidirectional charging. They can draw clean power when renewables are humming on the grid, and their owners get paid to send some back to a utility to meet growing demand — creating a vast distributed network that could make the electrical system more reliable, not less. Research has found that globally, less than a third of EV owners would have to opt into such a system to meet the rising need for energy storage.

Until now, we’ve been customers of utilities — with power flowing one way to homes — but more and more we’ll be active participants in the grid, sending extra battery power the other way. That shift is getting a head start in Maryland, where last month the Baltimore Gas and Electric Company partnered with Sunrun, which provides home solar and batteries, and Ford, which makes the electric F-150 Lightning, to activate the nation’s first residential V2G pilot project.

“This is the first time there are actual customers who are off-boarding power from their electric vehicles to the grid, and we’re doing it at peak times in the evening,” said Chris Rauscher, vice president of grid services at Sunrun, referring to the periods of greatest need for electricity. “So we’re actually reducing the stress and the demand on the grid — crushing the curve, crushing the peak — which helps lower costs for everyone.”

To understand how this works, think of EVs less like vehicles and more like immense batteries on wheels. In fact, the Lightning’s battery is 10 times bigger than a residential pack, Rauscher said. “There’s more energy capacity deployed today in electric vehicle batteries on the road in the U.S. than in all stationary batteries combined,” Rauscher added. “This is a massive resource.” And it’s only getting more massive: The Natural Resources Defense Council has estimated that if California V2G’ed all of the 14 million EVs it’s expected to have by 2035, it could power every home in the state for three days.

In these early days of the tech, though, only a handful of models sport V2G capabilities, but the number is growing. The hardware and software aren’t wildly complicated. A special charger juices up the vehicle’s battery, then draws from the car to power a house, in the case of vehicle-to-home systems, or sends it back to the utility, in the case of vehicle-to-grid.

Utilities will have to communicate with anyone participating in such a program, for instance, with an app that allows a customer to, say, ask that their vehicle never be discharged below a certain percentage. Each utility will also need to figure out how much to compensate people for their power in order to incentivize them to join in. That might mean paying for the amount of energy provided, the same principle behind net metering, in which residential solar customers are reimbursed for the energy they give to the grid. “We’re still in a bit of an early stage here,” said Divesh Gupta, director of clean energy solutions at Baltimore Gas and Electric Company. “There are a lot of things that need to be worked out, particularly on the customer-experience side.”

That battery power need not go all the way back to the grid, though, to help utilities. For years now, owners have been using their Ford Lightning trucks to power their homes. These batteries are mammoth — the extended-range version can go 300-plus miles — and powering a home with one uses just five or six miles of that range per hour.

So say an owner returns home at 6 p.m., when demand on the grid is skyrocketing as everyone else is knocking off work and switching on air conditioners and other energy-hungry appliances. Because consumption is rising, so too is the price of electricity. But a Lightning owner doesn’t have to pay that if they’re using their battery to power their home for five hours until they go to bed, using 25 to 30 miles of range on their battery. “It basically makes the house disappear, effectively, from the grid,” said Ryan O’Gorman, Ford’s business lead for vehicle-to-grid and vehicle-to-home.

Then the owner can charge again when demand, and electricity prices, are lower. If they work from home, for example, they can charge during the day, when lots of solar power is coursing through the grid.

More homes tapping EV batteries also eases demand on the grid, which is especially welcome during a heatwave when everyone’s running their AC units. Those heat waves will only get worse from here — a growing challenge for utilities to provide the power that keeps people cool and safe. At the same time, ever more data centers are devouring ever more power and stressing the grid to its limits. That infrastructure also must accommodate other forms of decarbonization, like heat pumps and induction stoves, that are essential for weaning us off fossil fuels.

Instead of sitting idly in a garage depreciating, V2G turns an EV into an asset for bolstering the grid and powering the home cheaply. “Cars are parked more than 22 hours a day,” O’Gorman said. “When we look at the advantages of an EV, now that vehicle can provide savings and potentially revenue flows for the customer.” (Interestingly, even electric trains can now send juice back to the grid and generate revenue, thanks to what they gain from regenerative braking: In the Bay Area, the Caltrain system is now being compensated for that energy, slashing its estimated annual power cost from $19.5 million to $16.5 million.)

The residential V2G program in Baltimore follows other experiments across the nation with larger vehicles. In Oakland, California, for instance, the utility Pacific Gas & Electric worked with the electric bus provider Zum to deploy vehicles that take kids home in the afternoon, return to the lot, and plug back into the grid. Because their batteries are so large, they have ample power left over, sending that extra energy to the grid just as demand is spiking. They charge overnight, take kids to school, and plug in again to charge.

This kind of predictability could make commercial fleets even more powerful for V2G than residential vehicles, experts say. A school bus is on a schedule a utility can rely on — it’s parked and available at certain times of day and making the rounds at others. Plus, in the summer, they would be available almost constantly. Other fleets, like delivery and government vehicles, follow regular timetables as well.

Fleet managers can also procure large numbers of the appropriate chargers, buying into the system en masse, compared to a homeowner shelling out for just one. “In the short term, we see commercial-level V2G applications as more viable due to infrastructure costs, but we expect affordable domestic units to emerge as the market matures and demand grows,” said a spokesperson for Nissan, which has long included bidirectional charging in its electric Leaf.

Utilities are still figuring out how to coordinate this ballet between vehicle, charger, and grid on a citywide scale. But the payoff could be big, because all those EVs are existing infrastructure that could help reduce the need to build dedicated battery plants to store renewable energy. The less a utility has to build, the fewer costs it has to pass on to ratepayers. And with more V2G, a utility that has to import lots of electricity from a neighboring state can now store power locally.

Thus, this technology could reduce energy bills. And for participants, their vehicles now provide transportation and energy storage. “It would seem pretty easy to imagine that that’s going to be cheaper than building just stationary battery storage facilities that do nothing but support the grid in times of need,” said Rudi Halbright, product manager of VGI pilot implementation at Pacific Gas & Electric. “Because you’re not getting that secondary use with those batteries. They’re kind of sitting around a lot of the time.”

People are more complicated than battery banks, though. Folks with busy lives want the convenience of charging their cars whenever they like and might not even realize how much prices fluctuate throughout the day, said David Victor, a professor at the University of California, San Diego, who studies the behavior of EV drivers. Many like the peace of mind of having a fully charged vehicle ready at all times. “I take from that that V2G is going to be really, really hard for fleets outside of professionally managed fleets,” Victor said, “that we know reliably are going to be available at the time that the V2G asset is going to be needed.”

Still, given the number of EVs out there, only a fraction of owners need to participate to make a sizable impact. And residential and commercial V2G can complement each other — and in turn, complement a utility’s larger battery facilities — a widescale diversification of energy storage that could accelerate the adoption of renewables. “I fundamentally believe that bidirectional electric vehicles are going to be something that no one’s ever heard of, until suddenly everyone has it,” Rauscher said. “Once we have enough customers enrolled and deployed out there, some percent of customers not plugging in and performing doesn’t really matter.”",https://static.stacker.com/s3fs-public/images/stories/2025/11/07/grist-how-evs-can-fix.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 13:00:32.384297

Utility-scale solar expanded by 35.8% while that from small-scale systems rose by 11.2% during the first nine months of 2025 compared to the same period in 2024. The combination of utility-scale and small-scale solar increased by almost one-third (29.0%) and produced a bit over 9% (utility-scale: 6.85%; small-scale: 2.16%) of total U.S. electrical generation for January-September — up from 7.2% a year earlier. This is according to a review of the data by the SUN DAY Campaign.

For the third consecutive month, utility-scale solar generated more electricity than the nation’s wind farms — by 4% in July, by 15% in August, and by 9% in September. Including residential systems, solar has out-produced wind five months in a row and by over 40% during September.

Similarly, solar-generated electricity year-to-date (YTD) easily surpassed — by almost 65% — the output of the nation’s hydropower plants (5.5% of total generation). In September alone, solar-generated electricity more than doubled the output of the nation’s hydropower plants. In fact, in both September and YTD, solar produced more electricity than hydropower, biomass and geothermal combined.

During the first nine months of 2025, electrical generation by wind plus utility-scale and small-scale solar provided 18.8% of the U.S. total, up from 17.1% during the first three-quarters of 2024. Further, the combination of wind and solar provided 15.1% more electricity than did coal during the first nine months of this year, and 9.8% more than the nation’s nuclear power plants. In fact, as solar and wind expanded, nuclear-generated electricity dropped by 0.1%.

The mix of all renewables produced 8.7% more electricity in January-September than they did a year ago and provided 25.6% of total U.S. electricity production compared to 24.2% one year earlier. Renewables’ share of electrical generation is now second to only that of natural gas whose electrical output actually dropped by 3.8% during the first nine months of 2025.

Sykes said the abundance of water in the Ohio River Basin, compared to the droughts facing western U.S. states, is worth protecting.","U.S. Reps. Morgan McGarvey, a Louisville Democrat, and Erin Houchin, a Salem Republican, want to finance a federal program to do widespread ecological restoration of the Ohio River and the network of waterways that comprise its basin.

The pair’s proposed legislation comes as local and national groups push an ambitious plan to address what they say are serious threats to the 204,000 square mile basin that spreads across 14 states and brings drinking water to more than 30 million people.

McGarvey is optimistic.

“The momentum’s there, the partnerships are there — across party lines, across regional lines — to hopefully start bringing the resources we need to protect the Ohio River,” he said.

The Ohio River Restoration Program Act would create a team within the Environmental Protection Agency to guide efforts to restore and protect the basin’s rivers, streams and wetlands.

The bill seeks $350 million in annual funding for five consecutive fiscal years. Money that could be used to help clean up toxic pollution, improve drinking water quality, repair fish and wildlife habitats or root out invasive species. The new team would need to create an action plan to begin addressing restoration efforts within the first two years.

The federal government would have a roadmap to follow in deciding what projects to finance: The Ohio River Basin Restoration and Protection Plan, developed by the University of Louisville’s Envirome Institute, the Ohio River Basin Alliance and the National Wildlife Federation, with input from scientific experts, community leaders and residents.

Houchin, who represents a Southern Indiana district that stretches downriver from Lawrenceburg to New Amsterdam, said she found common ground with McGarvey on this issue during discussions the two had on flights to and from Washington D.C.

The pair reinvigorated a congressional caucus for the Ohio River Basin and, with McGarvey’s leadership, got legislation to create a federal restoration program off the ground in 2024.

“We're going to try as hard as we can to take this as far as we can while the momentum is on our side, and continue to build and grow this coalition that cares about the Ohio River Basin and wants to see it funded,” Houchin said.

She said her interest in working on legislation like this stemmed from the disastrous 2023 derailment of a Norfolk Southern train in East Palestine, Ohio.

“It was at that time that we were monitoring with ORSANCO, every day, the particulates that were traveling down the river. Because we do have people that rely on the Ohio River for their source of water,” she said. “And we discovered in those efforts that the Ohio River Basin is … the largest river basin without any dedicated federal funding, and it is also the second-most endangered river basin.”

Houchin said the river is a vital economic thoroughfare on which more than a third of America’s maritime commerce travels.

Bipartisan support

The legislation is co-sponsored by a Republican and two Democrats on the House of Representatives’ Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.

U.S. Rep. Emilia Strong Sykes, a Democrat from Akron, Ohio and committee member, said she’s concerned about water quality, water safety, accessibility and affordability.

Sykes said the abundance of water in the Ohio River Basin, compared to the droughts facing western U.S. states, is worth protecting.

“It is much more important for us now to protect our water sources and devote the attention and resources to it now, before it's too late,” she said.

Sykes pointed to Ohio’s Cuyahoga River, which notoriously caught fire decades ago because of rampant pollution and helped inspire Congress to create the EPA, as an example of what it can look like when large bodies of water are neglected.

“Sometimes we get things right, and we learn from our mistakes,” she said. “That's what's happening here, and this is why the timeliness is just so high.”

Sykes said she’s hopeful the bill will get a committee hearing soon.

“This is, fortunately, one of the more bipartisan committees … so the likelihood is more reasonable than maybe others,” Sykes said.

Why federal involvement?

McGarvey said establishing a federal program makes sense when the goal is to rehabilitate waterways across a broad swath of the country.

“This is when it is appropriate for the federal government to get involved, to coordinate people at every single level to clean up the river all the way through,” he said. “To make sure that it's there for future generations.”

Their plan is modeled after similar federal restoration programs that have supported other historic American waters, like the Great Lakes and Chesapeake Bay. McGarvey said financing initiatives like these is a sound investment, with the Great Lakes program returning $3 in economic impact for every $1 in government money spent on it.

Other Congress members have joined Sykes, Houchin and McGarvey to co-sponsor the new legislation: Democratic Rep. Frank Mrvan and Republican Reps. Mark Messmer and Jefferson Shreve of Indiana, GOP Rep. Michael Rulli of Ohio, and Democratic Rep.

These factors position Asia Pacific as the global centre of energy storage deployment and consulting expertise.

The North America region is rapidly expanding on a global scale due to the faster adoption of clean energy in leading sectors and the increasing development of utility-grade renewable projects. Utilities across the region are accelerating investments in large solar farms, onshore and offshore wind installations and hybrid systems that require advanced storage solutions for frequency regulation, peak shaving and grid resilience. Moreover, ongoing grid digitalization initiatives in the region and the need for AI-based asset performance modelling are fuelling the consulting business further. These initiatives support predictive maintenance, real-time grid visibility and optimised dispatch, which strengthen long-term demand for specialised engineering and integration services.

On a country level, the U.S. is experiencing a significant growth rate due to powerful moves by authorities regarding state-level clean energy demand, along with the rapid deployment of grid-based and behind-the-meter storage systems to provide a constant energy supply to every sector. States such as California, New York, Texas and Arizona are implementing aggressive storage mandates and providing financial incentives that accelerate deployment. The combination of federal tax credits, large-scale BESS projects, and expanding commercial and industrial storage installations positions the U.S. as a major driver of the North American energy storage consulting and deployment market.

Across the country, town and city governments are embedding the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) into routine planning, public services, and community development, demonstrating a model of localized action that is drawing attention across Europe and Central Asia. What began as targeted support from the Joint SDG Fund has evolved into a coordinated municipal movement focused on measurable progress, institutional accountability, and inclusive growth.

A National Shift Toward Measurable Local Action

The joint program—implemented by UNDP, UNICEF, and FAO—has equipped Georgia’s local governments with practical tools to convert high-level SDG commitments into actionable policy. This work includes new planning methodologies, inter-sector partnerships, and systems for tracking progress across social, environmental, and governance priorities.

One of the most significant outcomes has been the adoption of Voluntary Local Reviews (VLRs). These action-oriented assessments allow municipalities to benchmark their progress, prioritize interventions, and collaborate with neighboring regions. Georgia’s VLR model is increasingly referenced in international development discussions as a replicable approach to SDG localization, particularly in countries with diverse municipal capacities.

To date, more than 500 national and local officials, civil society members, and sector partners have been trained to align local development plans with SDG targets. This has improved coordination across government levels, resulting in more transparent planning cycles and clearer lines of accountability.

Data Systems Designed for People, Not Paperwork

A key feature of Georgia’s approach is the emphasis on evidence-based decision-making. The introduction of the Digital Needs Assessment Portal (social.nala.ge) enables municipalities to identify the needs of children and vulnerable families with greater precision. Developed with the National Association of Local Authorities of Georgia (NALAG) and the International School of Economics (ISET), the portal centralizes data to support targeted social services.

Complementing this system is a Child-Centered Budget Analysis (CCBA) framework that helps municipalities track how local budgets influence child welfare outcomes. Together, these tools shift municipal planning from reactive spending to proactive policy design—ensuring that children and families benefit from equitable and inclusive services.

Preliminary findings shared by program partners indicate that municipalities using the portal are better able to map service gaps, evaluate program effectiveness, and align local priorities with national social protection strategies.

Building Sustainable Systems from the Ground Up

Environmental sustainability is another core pillar of the program. Municipalities have updated their Waste Management Plans (2023–2027) to incorporate Georgia’s first structured five-level food waste hierarchy, supported by the country’s new Law on Food Loss and Waste Reduction. This hierarchy prioritizes prevention, redistribution, composting, and recovery before disposal.

More than 100 municipal officials, entrepreneurs, educators, and youth leaders have participated in community initiatives focused on reducing food waste, promoting composting practices, and supporting food donation programs. These interventions not only improve waste outcomes but also strengthen public awareness around responsible consumption—an area where local action directly influences national environmental goals.

Youth as Catalysts for Community Transformation

The program has also invested in emerging leaders. Over **100 young people—70% of them girls—**have been trained as SDG ambassadors, leading community projects, local awareness campaigns, and peer-to-peer education initiatives. Their participation demonstrates how youth-centered engagement can accelerate policy adoption and foster social innovation at the local level.

Georgia’s municipal leaders have highlighted youth involvement as a key factor in sustaining momentum, reinforcing that long-term SDG progress depends on generational continuity and civic participation.

From Local Lessons to Global Platforms

Georgia’s experience is increasingly recognized in international forums. At the Regional Forum for Sustainable Development, municipal representatives shared insights into how cross-sector partnerships are modernizing governance structures. A recent study tour with UN-Habitat in Portugal further strengthened Georgia’s ability to replicate and adapt international best practices, particularly in urban governance and community-centered planning.

These engagements underscore how locally driven progress can inform global SDG implementation, contributing to broader regional and international learning.

The next phase of the “Planning for Change with the SDGs” program aims to deepen the systems already in place. Priority areas include expanding municipal data capacity, integrating SDGs into routine policy cycles, strengthening civil society engagement, and extending support to more rural municipalities.",https://alpha.creativecirclecdn.com/environment/original/20251130-111009-23e-Youth%20and%20local%20officials%20collaborating%20on%20community%20sustainability%20planning%20outdoors..jpg,N,,2025-12-01 09:58:29.098826

President Donald Trump is no fan of renewable energy, deriding efforts to expand wind and solar power as a “joke.” “They don't work. They're too expensive. They're not strong enough to fire up the plants that you need to make your country great,” he told the United Nations General Assembly in September.

And certainly his administration has worked hard all year to eliminate incentives for clean energy and electric vehicles in favor of boosting U.S. production and consumption of fossil fuels. Nevertheless, the country’s investment in those areas is on track to set an annual record in 2025 – though the pace of expansion shows signs of slowing, according to data compiled by Rhodium Group and the MIT-CEEPR Clean Investment Monitor.

In the third quarter, spending on clean energy and transportation jumped 8% from a year ago to $75 billion, the highest quarterly amount ever. And so far this year, such investments are running 6% ahead of the first three quarters of 2024, according to the report. A big driver for the third-quarter increase was Trump’s phaseout of $7,500 tax credits for electric vehicles on Sept. 30, which triggered a rush in buying. Retail purchases of heat pumps and battery-storage systems for residential solar customers also rose significantly.

Increased demand for electricity, driven by the rapid growth of AI data centers, likely helped boost spending on utility-scale renewable power projects and industrial decarbonization technologies, which rose 15% from the year-earlier quarter. Unfortunately, investments in manufacturing projects for clean energy technology – such as battery plants – fell for a fourth consecutive quarter and were down 26% from a year ago.

Pressure on utilities to quickly add more power-generation capacity may continue to aid the expansion of renewables, but announcements by companies related to spending on industrial decarbonization projects in the third quarter plunged 56% from a year earlier, the report said. And the loss of federal incentives to buy EVs is expected to sharply lower the growth in that segment both in 2025’s final quarter and next year. So while full-year U.S. investment in cleantech should top last year’s $267 billion tally, even with some slowing, things may not be so rosy in 2026.

The Big Read

How AI Is Ushering In A New Nuclear Age

At Aalo Atomics’ 40,000-square-foot factory on the south side of Austin, Texas, workers move five-eighths-inch-thick steel plates onto machines that slowly bend and roll them into 12-foot-wide cylinders, which they then weld into 25-foot-tall vessels. These could be made cheaper by outside contractors. But Aalo cofounder and CEO Matt Loszak wants to do this work in-house, since each vessel will eventually contain the guts of a ten-megawatt (MW) nuclear fission reactor. Five of these Aalo-1 reactor units, working in tandem, will power a single 50 MW electric turbine—enough juice to run a large data-processing center or 45,000 homes.

“It’s not a paper reactor; it’s getting built,” declares Loszak, a 35-year-old Canadian engineer now on his third startup. In August, Aalo broke ground on a two-acre site at the Department of Energy’s Idaho National Laboratory, where it aims to achieve “criticality” by July 4, 2026—America’s 250th birthday and the deadline President Donald Trump has set for at least three U.S. startups to prove that their advanced nuclear reactor designs work. To achieve criticality, Aalo will load a vessel with off-the-shelf nuclear fuel rod assemblies and then initiate a self-sustaining nuclear fission chain reaction.

Producing electricity? That comes later. Even after achieving criticality, Aalo will still need to build out manufacturing and a supply chain of vendors, sign data center customers and get final approval from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. “We’ll get the factory set up, come down the cost curve and have this Holy Grail product,’’ vows Loszak, who is shopping for up to 1 million square feet for a gigafactory and recently hired Bryson Gentile, who headed Falcon 9 manufacturing at Elon Musk’s SpaceX, to set up Aalo’s mass production operation. “What Elon did [with electric cars and rockets] was kind of like running the four-minute mile. When that happens, everyone’s like, ‘Wait, this is possible,’ ” Loszak says. He hopes to produce electricity in 2027.

Demand for electricity is soaring, largely because of the power-sucking data centers undergirding the artificial intelligence boom, and Loszak isn’t the only nuclear entrepreneur aiming to ride the wave of AI dollars. A dozen ventures with names like Valar Atomics, Oklo, Kairos Power and X-energy are racing to perfect, permit and deploy a new generation of small, prefabricated reactors that could power individual data centers or even feed the larger electrical grid.

Hot Topic

Jacqueline Novogratz, Acumen founder & CEO, on investing in the developing world amid a pullback in U.S. aid and private funding

You've been in this space for 24 years. In that time, how many startups and companies have you funded in Africa and elsewhere?

About 220, roughly – maybe 240. And some of them have gone on to create whole new industries.

How has funding your investments changed over the past year, given that there’s a bit less emphasis on ESG among institutional investors?

I think that with the end of aid from the United States and the massive decline around the world, we saw both enormous disruption and destruction of lives, of people's health, and of the environment. I don't want to make an excuse for the way it was done.

At the same time, I started Acumen 24 years ago because I didn't think aid was going to solve problems in poverty. That was our beginning. I'm not nostalgic for the old age, but you can't just kill a system overnight. I think a lot of people feel that way. And now the world is looking for post-aid investment structures that go into those underdeveloped markets where people are overlooked and underestimated, and have been for as long as I've been alive. I actually find a great opportunity in this moment for these kinds of structures.

What are some examples of successes Acumen has had in funding startups in parts of the world that don't have electricity or distribution or logistics?

Probably our best example is in electrification. In 2007, 1.5 billion people on the planet had no access to electricity – 1.5 billion. We invested in one of the first off-grid solar lighting companies. It was just a box, a light. I would say irreverently that the entrepreneur didn't really know what they were doing. Neither did we. But over the next 10 years, we learned with them as they understood their customers and how to build distribution and how to finance and how to market, and how to build trust. And 10 years later, they were ready for growth capital. That was our first growth fund. Along the way, we started investing in other companies in that off-grid solar sector. And a few years ago, we realized that we, a nonprofit investor in 40 companies, had brought off-grid light and electricity to 300 million low-income people.

At that point, the world was looking at what's left: 600 million people, mostly in Africa, still have no access to off-grid light and electricity. So we asked ourselves, alright, if Acumen is going to go in and participate in what is a moral imperative as well as a productivity imperative, what's our role?

So we created a facility that is called the hardest to reach, which is unapologetically blended to take on the 16 most challenging markets in Africa that include Benin, Somalia, Chad, DRC, South Sudan, Malawi, and I could go on. We would take $60 million of philanthropy so that we could do those early-stage investments. We recently made our first loan in Somalia. Then, side by side, would be a $200 million blended debt facility so that we had enough working capital to keep companies in the countries in which they were operating. Twenty-three different stakeholders, from philanthropists to Shinhan Bank, which is a commercial bank in Korea, are coming together to make this change happen. I think this is the future if we are going to build markets for people that we have overlooked.

Since you have some of the riskiest startups out there, the understanding is that some of your portfolio companies aren’t going to make it. How do you handle that?

First of all, if you're not willing to fail, you will not succeed. Second, I think too many investors always focus on the downside. What could go wrong? In our markets, a lot could go wrong. Macroeconomic and exogenous influences, I could go on. But what we also have to ask ourselves is what is the cost of not daring? What is the cost of not trying? If you're looking at bringing off-grid solar electricity to, in our case, 70 million low-income people in very challenging markets, the risk of not daring is rising emissions. That is raising instability, and it’s raising migration. We have to start thinking more holistically about how we use the tools of investment to solve problems, recognizing that if we're careful and smart enough, we can provide returns based on the expectations of different investor classes.

The EPA and the Department of Justice have announced a nationwide settlement with Lowe’s Home Centers, LLC, requiring the company to pay a $12.5 million civil penalty for violations of the federal Lead Renovation, Repair, and Painting (RRP) Rule.

According to the agencies, Lowe’s failed to ensure that renovation work performed in homes built before 1978 complied with lead-safe practices. EPA’s investigation found widespread noncompliance across more than 250 renovation jobs in 23 states between 2019 and 2021. The agency cited failures such as the use of uncertified contractors, inadequate containment of dust and paint debris, and the company’s failure to provide residents with required lead-hazard information prior to beginning renovation work.

Lead-based paint, banned in the United States in 1978, remains a major source of childhood lead exposure in older housing. Renovation activities that disturb lead paint can release hazardous dust and chips that pose significant health risks, particularly to children. EPA officials emphasized that improper renovation practices can result in exposure levels known to cause neurological damage, developmental delays, and other long-term health effects.

Under the terms of the settlement, Lowe’s must implement a comprehensive, corporate-wide compliance program designed to prevent future violations. The program requires Lowe’s to use only certified renovation firms and certified renovators, verify the age of every property before beginning work, and maintain an electronic compliance system that documents all lead-safe procedures. Lowe’s is also required to conduct at least 4,000 jobsite inspections and submit regular compliance reports to the EPA for the next three years.

This settlement builds on a 2014 consent decree in which Lowe’s agreed to comply with the RRP Rule after earlier violations. EPA and DOJ officials noted that improved oversight and stronger compliance systems are essential to preventing harmful lead exposures during home renovations.

“We're excited to help power the next wave of technological advancement while delivering tangible benefits that will enhance the lives of Indiana residents for years to come.”

Infrastructure and energy to support growth

The data centre expansion is supported by a new energy agreement between Amazon and the Northern Indiana Public Service Company (NIPSCO).

The partnership includes the creation of NIPSCO Generation (GenCo), which will manage infrastructure to supply power to the facilities.

Amazon will fund the required plants, lines and equipment without passing costs to local residents or businesses.

NIPSCO expects the agreement to generate US$1bn in cost savings for current electric customers over 15 years.

This surplus will also improve energy reliability during peak demand, such as extreme weather, by increasing total generation capacity beyond Amazon’s own 2.4GW needs.

Vince Parisi, NIPSCO President and COO, says: “This agreement structure with Amazon represents approximately US$1bn in cost savings over 15 years to our existing NIPSCO electric customers while strengthening our regional grid and economic future.

“By structuring this agreement thoughtfully, we're ensuring our current customers are protected, without increasing their rates, while we expand our capacity to meet growing demands.

“This project isn't just about powering data centres, it's about powering possibilities for our communities through thousands of new jobs, an expanded tax base and building a skilled workforce in Northern Indiana for long-term growth and prosperity.""

Governor Mike Braun adds: “This is a massive win for Hoosier ratepayers. This agreement will ensure a surplus in new energy development that will deliver real savings to Hoosier ratepayers.

“Amazon’s historic investment shows that Indiana’s business-friendly climate continues to attract world-class employers and drive growth in our state.

“This project will create more than a thousand jobs while supporting thousands more across the region, further strengthening Indiana’s position in energy dominance and economic leadership.”

And, on November 18, Constellation Energy announced a $1 billion loan from DOE to restart Three Mile Island nuclear facility.","On October 15, 2025, AEP Transmission LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of American Electric Power Company (AEP), closed a $1.6 billion term-loan financing guaranteed by the US Department of Energy (DOE), marking the first DOE loan guaranteed financing to close since President Trump’s inauguration in January. AEP operates the nation’s largest electric transmission system, spanning more than 40,000 miles and serving over five million customers. The company sought DOE financing to rebuild and reconductor approximately 5,000 miles of transmission lines across five states – Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma and West Virginia – modernizing grid infrastructure and improving reliability for millions of consumers.

The credit facility was structured as a low-interest term loan advanced by the Federal Financing Bank and fully guaranteed by the DOE under its Energy Infrastructure Reinvestment authority. The federal financing backed by DOE’s guarantee will significantly reduce borrowing costs and allow AEP to accelerate capital deployment at a time when private financing for large-scale transmission upgrades may be constrained.

The AEP transaction may very well serve as an early model for subsequent electric power infrastructure financings under the DOE’s newly branded Energy Infrastructure Reinvestment and Energy Dominance Financing Programs.

A Program Built to Bridge Innovation and Capital

The DOE’s loan guarantee program was created under Title XVII of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (then called “Incentives for Innovative Technologies”) to help finance innovative energy technologies that, at time of financing, wouldn’t meet market norms for “commercial technology.” By providing federal guarantees for loans provided by the Federal Financing Bank, or potentially private lenders, the program aimed to close the financing gap between innovative technology and market-tested (i.e., bankable) deployment.

Over the years, the DOE’s Loan Program Office (LPO), created to administer the loan guarantee program, financed projects that redefined the US energy landscape: utility-scale solar farms, advanced vehicle manufacturing, and more recently, next-generation carbon-capture facilities among them. Through these investments, DOE has been perhaps the principal actor in the US helping to move new-generation clean energy technologies from the margin to the mainstream.

Following the inauguration of President Biden, the loan guarantee program received a boost from both the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which among other things increased the funds authorized for the program. The IRA also created a new category of projects eligible for funding under Section 1706 of Title XVII named the Energy Infrastructure Reinvestment Financing program (EIRF). In its guidance, the Biden era LPOdescribed the new funding as aiming to provide a “bridge to bankability,” especially for new projects that contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas pollution that may have trouble arranging financing from commercial lenders.

A New Mandate: Financing Energy Dominance

The new Trump Administration hassignificantly shifted US energy policy, rejecting the concept of climate change, and emphasizing instead fossil fuels as the means to achieving energy security and dominance.

The new Congress reflected President Trump’s pivot in passing the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA). The OBBBA revised Section 1706, rebranding it as the “Energy Dominance Program” and changing its emphasis from promoting clean energy generation to facilitating projects using fossil resources, as well as mining projects, for the sake of national security. The OBBBA rescinded the unobligated funds inked by the IRA for Section 1706 but at the same time appropriated $1 billion to DOE to “carry out activities” under section 1706 (of which not more than 3 percent is to be used for administrative expenses) and authorized $250 billion in new loan guarantees for the revised Energy Dominance program through September 30, 2028.

Consistent with the policy shift to encompass fossil resources, Section 50403 of the OBBBA removed a Section 1706 eligibility criterion that a project must “avoid, reduce, utilize, or sequester air pollutants or anthropogenic emissions.” Additionally, program eligibility is expanded to include projects that will “increase capacity or output” or “support or enable the provision of known or forecastable electric supply at time intervals necessary to maintain or enhance grid reliability or other system adequacy needs.” The OBBBA also revised the definition of “Energy Infrastructure” to become a facility (and associated equipment), used to enable “production, processing, transportation, transmission, refining and generation needed for energy and critical minerals.”

On October 28, DOE published an Interim Final Rule which amends the DOE’s loan guarantee regulations to implement the Energy Dominance Financing provisions of the OBBBA. Among other provisions it will add a requirement that an electricity utility infrastructure project applying for funding from the 1706 program demonstrate that the financial benefits from a DOE guarantee will be shared with its customers, or the associated community served by it. Significantly, no similar requirement is made in the Interim Final Rule with respect to other types of Energy Infrastructure covered by the Energy Dominance program. While it is “effective” as of October 28, the period for public comment on the Interim Final Rule expires on December 29, 2025. The text of he rule and information on how to provide comments can be found here.

The above notwithstanding, Title XVII survived mostly unchanged, except for the revised Section 1706. As an important example, the OBBB did not change Section 1706 (a)(1) under which the AEP financing was closed, and which contemplates guarantees for projects to “retool, repower, repurpose or replace energy infrastructure that has ceased operations.” Moreover, the OBBBA did not amend Section 1703 of the Energy Policy Act, which authorizes DOE loan guarantees for projects that “avoid, reduce, or sequester air pollutants or anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases and employ new or significantly improved technologies as compared to commercial technologies in service in the United States at the time the guarantee is issued”, including, among others, Renewable Energy Systems, carbon capture projects and those projects that increase the domestically produced supply of critical minerals. However, the OBBBA in practice defunded the innovative energy program (among other programs) for future projects.

The AEP Transmission Financing: A Case Study in Transition

Bracewell’s representation of AEP in this transaction provides some unique insights into how DOE’s pre-existing loan guarantee framework will evolve to operate effectively within the new energy-dominance policy environment. AEP, like several utilities in the DOE queue, applied for funding and executed a preliminary term sheet before President Trump’s second inauguration in January.

The AEP deal advanced under challenging conditions – not only the change in administration after term sheet signing, but also the longest ever federal government shutdown that halted some agency operations. Despite these challenges, the transaction closed smoothly in October, aided by a pragmatic and flexible approach implemented by both the AEP and DOE teams to navigate the DOE’s existing procedural complexities, while balancing the policies and interests of DOE in following governmental norms with the commercial interests of AEP in achieving a resilient and administratively manageable financing structure under its 30-year tenure.

The willingness of both parties to overcome challenges within existing statutory and policy constraints was essential. The transaction helped establish a working model for balancing regulatory compliance with project-level realities. It provides a roadmap for future DOE-guaranteed financings, not only for the small group of forthcoming utility-oriented financings already in the queue, but also for new projects under the OBBBA’s expanded eligibility scope.

Looking Forward

Under the energy-dominance framework and its expanded reach, the DOE loan guarantee program is poised to continue to be a strategic financing platform encompassing the full spectrum of US energy infrastructure, with an emphasis on innovation, reliability, security and independence, and agnostic on type of fuel or feedstock. To prove this point, in late October DOE closed a second loan, a $1.5 billion loan to Wabash Valley Resources to finance the restart and repurposing of a coal to ammonia fertilizer facility in Indiana that was idled since 2016. The revamped facility will produce 500,000 mtpy of anhydrous ammonia from coal from a nearby mine and pet coke as feedstock. And, on November 18, Constellation Energy announced a $1 billion loan from DOE to restart Three Mile Island nuclear facility.

For utilities and other project investors, the lesson is clear: US federal credit support remains one of the most powerful tools for accelerating capital into a changing environment for the energy infrastructure that underpins US economic strength.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.9762_2059.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 09:58:47.881521

“This has resulted in high costs and competitive disadvantages for the economy.” German industry is struggling on many fronts, including with US tariffs, Chinese competition, red tape, and pressure to decarbonise.
The DIHK represents nearly all German companies because membership is compulsory.
This will lead to significantly higher costs for German companies,” the paper says.
Currently, the caps in the EU emissions trading systems are set to reach zero by 2039, and in the early 2040s respectively.","One of Germany’s key business institutions, the chambers of industry and commerce, has called for an overhaul of climate policies to take pressure off companies.

“The current path of the energy transition in Germany is characterised by numerous, sometimes contradictory goals, detailed government control, insufficient European and international integration, and a lack of international coordination,” the organisation said in a climate policy paper adopted by its general assembly. “This has resulted in high costs and competitive disadvantages for the economy.”

German industry is struggling on many fronts, including with US tariffs, Chinese competition, red tape, and pressure to decarbonise. In particular, industries with a heavy use of energy in their processes such as steelmakers or chemicals have been under additional pressure due to price increases mainly for natural gas, following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

The DIHK represents nearly all German companies because membership is compulsory. Unlike business associations such as industry association BDI, the DIHK is not a conventional lobby group, but a public body with a legal mandate. The DIHK is the umbrella organisation for 79 regional chambers, which are expected to represent the entire business landscape, not the interests of particular sectors.

The paper notes that DIHK “has long been observing closures and relocations, particularly of energy-intensive production, and thus the loss of high-quality industrial jobs in Germany, particularly of energy-intensive production, and thus the loss of high-quality industrial jobs in Germany.”

“With its goal of becoming climate neutral by 2045, Germany has set itself a more ambitious target than the majority of industrialised and emerging countries. This will lead to significantly higher costs for German companies,” the paper says. To avoid competitive disadvantages, DIHK proposes “that German and European reduction targets should be aligned with the climate protection efforts of the most important economic competitors.”

DIHK calls for replacing strict annual climate targets

DIHK also said it opposed the strict annual climate targets laid out in Germany’s Climate Action Law, instead advocating a system that stipulates an overall budget of permissible emissions for a certain duration, but allows flexibility within that period.

Companies in Germany not only have to adhere to national regulation, but operate under a framework of EU rules. Adapting national targets would have to be complemented by changes at the European level. The EU-wide Emissions Trading Systems (EU ETS 1&2) set annually declining caps on emissions, which limits the flexibility for companies to emit more in the early years and less later.

Currently, the caps in the EU emissions trading systems are set to reach zero by 2039, and in the early 2040s respectively. However, this could change, as the EU and member states have begun talks to reform both systems and reached initial agreements.",https://www.cleanenergywire.org/sites/all/themes/cleanenergywire/logo_og.png,N,,2025-12-01 11:05:24.310995

CATL and Stellantis aim to have the new gigafactory in Zaragoza, located in Aragon, up and running by the end of 2026 and, with a joint investment of over 4 billion euros. The facility will run entirely on renewable energy. It is expected to deliver up to 50 GWh of lithium-iron phosphate batteries a year for electric vehicles.

CATL is the world's biggest and best-selling electric vehicle battery maker, and Stellantis is a global car manufacturer that has Jeep, Fiat, Chrysler, Dodge, Peugeot, and Vauxhall under its umbrella - among others.

These two multinational powerhouses have teamed up to build an EV battery plant with a clear aim.

""To accelerate the transition towards affordable, accessible, sustainable mobility for all,"" said Wu Qi, CEO of Contemporary Star Energy - the joint venture set up by CATL and Stellantis, in his speech at the ceremony.

Spanish Minister of Industry, Trade and Tourism Jordi Hereu said the groundbreaking ceremony represents a strategic milestone in Spain's new-energy transition and industrial modernization, as well as Europe's strategic independence on the world stage.

""Today we are laying the first stone, the fruit of cooperation and of a vision of what an independent European strategy needs to be - open to cooperation, to dialogue, to work with all of the countries in the world, and especially with a country like China,"" he said.

“Steve Bridges loves USI,” says Vice President for Finance and Administration Jeff Sickman, who has worked with Bridges since 2000.
Often, Bridges would wander into USI’s campus grill and feast on a cheeseburger made by the late Ida Layman while studying in one of the booths.
“Even outside of campus, he’s so personable.
The end result was invisible to students, but everyone else was much happier.” The takeaway fed right into Bridges’ pathway to university presidency: “Pay attention to people that do the work.","In his 36-year career, Steven Bridges’ résumé lists just two employers: Sureway grocery store in Henderson, Kentucky, and the University of Southern Indiana. He’d have it no other way.

Bridges, 59, was celebrated Oct. 16 as USI’s fifth president and first alumni leader. Sentimentally, he was invested by prior presidents H. Ray Hoops, Linda Bennett, and Ronald Rochon, all of whom he served under. Long an accounting and financial officer, his dedication to his alma mater led Bridges to be named interim president in 2024 when Rochon left for California State University in Fullerton after seven years helming USI. After a national search, USI’s board of trustees recognized Bridges’ longtime skills and devotion to USI and in April offered him the full-time presidency.

“Steve Bridges loves USI,” says Vice President for Finance and Administration Jeff Sickman, who has worked with Bridges since 2000. “His commitment to the university, its students, and its faculty and staff inspires the same commitment from others and creates a great environment in which to learn and work.”

Across campus, Bridges’ appointment has been morale boosting. “He consistently keeps students at the center of every decision,” says Michael Solliday, a junior computer science major who in July was appointed to a two-year student trustee term. “He cares so much for students because he’s been there himself. … Through his presence and integrity, students feel seen and valued, and that sets the tone for the culture he’s building at USI.”

Humble Roots

Bridges’ mother and father — who were one of 11 and nine children, respectively — did not give their only child an option about attending college: “From day one, they said, ‘We need you to get an education, to do the things we didn’t get to do,” he says. They used their savings to help fund his studies. Bridges spent much of his childhood helping his father on their Henderson County farm, opening seed bags on a flatbed truck and climbing around tractors. After graduating from Henderson County High School in 1984, he helped pay for his college studies by working at Sureway. Often, Bridges would wander into USI’s campus grill and feast on a cheeseburger made by the late Ida Layman while studying in one of the booths. “That’s when I started feeling the community of people here,” he says. “You felt like you were home.”

After he completed his studies in fall 1988, then-director of USI’s Career Services Office Marilyn Schmidt recommended Bridges for his first post-graduation job as a staff accountant in April 1989. Impressed by his work ethic, attention to detail and priorities, and commitment to his future career, Schmidt remarked at his inauguration, “Steve Bridges was the perfect candidate for that job 30-plus years ago, and he’s the perfect candidate now.”

“It was like a full circle,” Solliday says. “Seeing him on campus, but then knowing his background with USI, it honestly impacts my thoughts on my own career. (This) is exactly what it looks like to build a career in purpose, service, and long-term commitment, and seeing him model it so well has really encouraged me to think bigger about my own impact.”

As he joined USI as an employee in 1989, Bridges and new wife Rosemary were expecting their first of three children, all of whom have followed their father’s footsteps in attaining higher education — and two literally: His daughters both are USI graduates. Cory, Abby, and Emma grew up rooting for the Screaming Eagles, with Cory even serving as a ball boy for Bruce Pearl during the basketball coach’s nine-season tenure at USI. “We grew up on this campus,” Cory, a commercial loan officer at Field and Main Bank, said at his father’s inauguration. “… To see our father lead the university he loves is a real pleasure.”

Known for his humble, everyman nature, Bridges’ approachability has led to a deep connection with members of the university community. “I’d see him all the time as he made his way around campus, being very interactive with students and just in general,” says Solliday, a Switz City, Indiana, native who got to know Bridges while Solliday served as a student ambassador. “Even outside of campus, he’s so personable. He always asked how I’m doing, whether with classes or anything else. A few months ago, I was in a car accident back home, and he was one of the first people to ask how I was doing.”

Helping Bridges balance the rigors of the presidency is a loving home life. His family now has grown to include five grandchildren. Like his alma mater, Bridges is intimately connected to the Tri-State: Born in Kentucky, he owns a home on Lake Barkley in honor of his father, a native of nearby Cadiz. Bridges’ mother’s family — including his 81 first cousins: Son Cory joked that “every family reunion was a public speaking event” — is based in rural Southeastern Illinois at a farm Bridges frequently visits. And his professional life has been rooted in Southwestern Indiana, and soon his personal life will follow: Longtime residents of Henderson, Kentucky, Bridges and wife Rosemary will move into the president’s residence, a Colonial Revival with 8,552 square feet just off McDowell Road near campus, when renovations are finished.

His daily routine includes a coffee date with Rosemary, an office assistant at Henderson’s Holy Name of Jesus Catholic School. “Each morning, we have ‘coffee clique,’ and it’s our time together to relax, see what’s going on, talk about our day, what we have coming up,” he says. “The ‘coffee clique’ is the foundation of my day. It’s a bit of a zen and relaxation for me before I come in and life gets busy.”

Bridges is a long-time volunteer with the Girl Scouts of Southwest Indiana, where he’s often worked on community projects alongside new CEO Mary Fee. “His leadership shines not only through his professional achievements, but in all he does,” Fee says. “He shares his expertise, wisdom, and discernment to help strengthen our mission and expand our impact. But above all, we are grateful for his steadfast commitment to this community and for the genuine friendship he extends to those he serves.”

The avid sports fan rests and recharges through fishing and quiet everyday pursuits like mowing the lawn or throwing meat on his beloved Oklahoma Joe’s smoker. “I do it the old way with wood. I don’t have the digital things where I can go do something else. I sit down and smoke the meat. And I enjoy that time with my smoker and make a point to relax and let things run through my mind,” he says. “It’s my opportunity to get away, and things come to my mind without me even trying.”

Meeting Successes and Challenges

Rising through the ranks, his work ethic has impressed many. “He has worked hard in every role that he has held,” Sickman says of Bridges, who in 1995 completed his Master of Business Administration from USI. “He adapts and rises to the occasion in whatever role he serves, and he applies what he has learned both as a student and through his various jobs to meet the needs of the university.”

Sickman notes his admiration for Bridges’ adaptability, especially as the university weathered the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. “USI did not experience layoffs as many others did, and we never missed a paycheck because his fiscal management ensured that we had enough reserves to weather any storm,” says Sickman, who served as Bridges’ Assistant Vice President for Finance and Administration. “USI remained financially healthy during that turbulent time due to his sound financial management.”

Displaying a leadership style that prioritizes teamwork, Bridges says he prefers to guide people toward results he would like to see while giving them the freedom to make it happen. “His empathy and vision, his ability to truly listen … it creates trust and fosters collaboration. He balances compassion with strategic thinking and planning for the university,” Solliday says.

Bridges gives credit to his alma mater for creating leaders, including himself. “We had lots of people that learned about the things that they needed to, to be ready for the next position,” he says. “Just like when I went to interview for those jobs — this put me in a position to be ready.” But staying out of the trenches has been tough. “One of the hardest things is not to be in the details,” he says, but he relishes having “faith in the people who do the detailed work. That’s been a culture for us, to prepare for the future.”

Bridges’ continued employment by USI means the colleagues he’s now leading have witnessed his professional milestones and missteps, a humbling position for any president. He remembers with pride a software installation that impacted record keeping from financial aid to registration. Bridges had to step away from his position as Controller and Assistant Director of the Business Office for the three-year transition. “It was a huge hit for our office to lose Steve, but in hindsight, it was for the good of the campus,” says Sickman, who as manager of payment services reported to Bridges. “It was a campuswide initiative, and they needed someone who could unify everyone, and that’s exactly why he was tapped. It showed what he could do.”

“I never took for granted the sacrifices people made and the way we went about it,” Bridges says. “It connected me to alumni, to financial aid, to payroll, to students, to finance — literally, they’re still helping me today.”

Conversely, Bridges learned a valuable lesson from an at-first bungled attempt to streamline students getting their books. He was put in charge of building the procedure, and he’s blunt about his initial missteps. “I screwed that thing up. I made it so accountant-oriented. It was a backroom disaster,” he says. “I could’ve just abandoned it because I was frustrated and embarrassed by it. But people stayed with me, and they fought through my mistakes. We came up with a better way to do it, and we achieved what we wanted to. But I had to fail. I had to figure out where I messed up to come back, let people who really did the work tell me where I was wrong. The next semester was night and day. The end result was invisible to students, but everyone else was much happier.”

The takeaway fed right into Bridges’ pathway to university presidency: “Pay attention to people that do the work. It doesn’t matter where they are in the organizational chart. Listen to them,” Bridges says. “You have to learn to be able to not give up on what you’re trying to do, to listen to the people that can help you make it better, and to adjust that path as needed.”

Has Bridges ever been tempted to leave USI? The software migration project Bridges led caught the attention of a company that wanted to hire him, but he stayed rooted to campus. “Why would I leave a place that I love? Where is it better than here?” he says. “And so, never did I seriously entertain it, but like anyone, it’s nice to want to feel wanted. But I felt wanted here, most of all.”

His appreciation for USI’s environment and his relaxed, humble nature are why long-time colleagues still grab Bridges’ ear as he walks through campus — “They’re like, ‘What do I call you now?’ and I’m like, ‘Steve,’’ he laughs — and he appreciated having that background as he assumed the presidency. “I think they would tell you that I’m a straight shooter, I’m transparent, and I think that’s maybe why there’s a comfort with me in this role. I hope that’s the case. I would consider that the biggest compliment.”

For years, South of the Border included a casino because video poker was legal in South Carolina but illegal in North Carolina.","Part of the South of the Border roadside attraction — on Interstate 95 on the line between North and South Carolina — has been put up for sale.

The owners are selling 30 acres that include the Pedroland amusement park, the ""SOB Convention Center,"" a motel building, a mini-golf course, vacant land and a former casino. The price is listed at $2.85 million.

Those parts of the attraction have closed, but South of the Border is keeping its unusual sombrero observation tower, reptile lagoon, souvenir stores and restaurants. The main motel and campground are also still in operation.

Real-estate agent Ken Jackson says he anticipates the buyer will redevelop the site to take advantage of I-95 traffic. The only condition is that the new owner can't sell fireworks, because that's already part of South of the Border.

""We've had a lot of interest from people wanting to do that, but that's the only thing that wouldn't be allowed,"" he told WUNC.

Jackson says the property for sale could be redeveloped as a hotel or other travel-oriented business. He says while South of the Border has new competition from a Buc-ee's truck stop a few exits deeper into South Carolina near Florence, the location still gets heavy traffic.

""Buc-ee's is the new shiny toy, and it is attractive to travelers as well, but there are plenty of people traveling up and down the interstate, and enough for both businesses,"" Jackson said.

But he says it's unlikely the new owner would reopen the amusement park. ""I'm not sure there's much demand for amusement parks of that size anymore, but it's a great opportunity for someone to go in and build a modern hotel,"" Jackson said. ""It'd be a great place for RV sales or RV service center — anything travel-related, logistics-related.""

According to the real-estate listing, the old carousel that remains on the amusement park site won't be included in the sale.

South of the Border has been a quirky stop for travelers since the 1950s, but it's faced criticism in recent years for its cartoon depiction of a Mexican man in its many billboard ads. They include slogans like ""You never sausage a place! You're always a weiner at Pedro's!""

As anthropogenic climate change and pollution rapidly increase, pressures are placed on bee colonies throughout the country.
Here’s the question: If the EPA knows that certain pesticides are harmful to bee colonies, why are we still using them?
Protecting the honey bee is as essential as protecting our democracy and the industry on which our country was founded.
To be better, accountability and action need to be taken at the root cause of the decline in bee colonies.","From the agrarian ideals of Thomas Jefferson to the emergence of the military-industrial complex of post-World War II, the bee has remained an essential figure of American progress and democracy.

As our country expanded westward and established our government, the honey bee has long been a marker of the past, present and future of the United States of America. Yet today, the downfall of the honey bee at the expense of American progress has raised concerns about the future of our nation.

Arriving to the American colonies during the early 17th century, the honey bee quickly became acclimated to the ecosystems of North America. Although the modern species of Apis melliferia is native to Europe, an extinct species of honey bees once pollinated the landscapes of North America 14 million years ago.

Bees, native and nonnative, have become an essential part of American ecosystems, agriculture and biodiversity. As major pollinators, bees boost the food crops of the United States and work to reduce the impacts of climate change across the globe.

Yet today, the modern bee faces the same threat it once faced 14 million years ago in North America: extinction. As anthropogenic climate change and pollution rapidly increase, pressures are placed on bee colonies throughout the country.

Regardless of origin, species of bees and pollinators are threatened today under American lifestyles, consumption and policy, facing up to a 70% colony loss in 2025, the highest in U.S. history. Bees pollinate 75% of U.S. food and agricultural crops, contributing $15 billion to the U.S. economy every year.

The urgency hasn’t been placed on reducing bee habitat fragmentation or curbing the use of agricultural pesticides that have sparked a huge loss in colonies. Instead, the United States has taken a technological approach to curb pollinator losses and avoid changing lifestyle habits altogether.

An insulting mark of bees as infrastructure and replaceable technology has shifted the importance of bees from one of ensuring food security to agricultural profit, underscoring the profit-driven mindset amid an environmental crisis.

This leads us to question whether potential solutions exist to protect bees for pollination or to ensure monopolies have cheap, ready-to-use pesticides at their disposal. As the Environmental Protection Agency reports, “certain pesticides are harmful to bees,” further stating their measures and guidelines for “protecting bees” on product labels.

Here’s the question: If the EPA knows that certain pesticides are harmful to bee colonies, why are we still using them?

Here’s my answer: profit and influence.

As agribusiness attempts to maximize yields while cutting costs, cheap pesticides will continue to be used alongside monetary incentives towards the EPA to turn a blind eye to the scope of the problem. Under the current presidential administration, we see a reversal of any progress made when deregulation is placed in their hands.

Recently, institutions and research labs, in attempts to address growing colony losses, have begun developing artificial pollinator technologies to tackle the growing strain on pollination.

Under the status quo, can we expect the needed changes to occur? Here’s the short answer: no. As development and research ramp up through robot bees and artificial replacements to native pollinators, we are going in the wrong direction.

What this does is move the use and importance of bees away from their environmental importance, crucial during a time when more emphasis on environmental protection is needed.

What is so appalling about the development of pollinator technologies is the lack of actual credibility or accountability towards anthropogenic causes of bee habitat losses and colony decline. Instead of changing consumption patterns, the United States has encouraged technological advancements that have no long-term stability.

The effectiveness of artificial intelligence replacements or modified bees is dependent on specific environmental conditions and infrastructure. Natural bees are far more efficient and effective in saving and preventing gaps in pollination. In simple terms, protecting bee habitats or changing pesticide usage is far easier than developing and pouring countless dollars into artificial replacements.

To achieve true environmental sustainability and ecological solvency, actual bees need to be prioritized, and all parties must be held accountable for degrading actions. The solvency of the American agricultural industry and food security across the globe rely on the pollination of bees.

A reality that most farmers can not afford new technologies only furthers the dominance of agricultural monopolies, creating inequalities that could be avoided by simply preserving natural resources and bee populations.

To protect our crops from the impacts of anthropogenic climate change and consumption, the U.S. needs to prioritize the ecosystems of pollinators over human demands to avoid the same fate as 14 million years ago.

Without the honey bee, our democracy and values shift from one of the American dream of freedom and prosperity, to a reality of scarcity, degradation and denial.

Protecting the honey bee is as essential as protecting our democracy and the industry on which our country was founded. To be better, accountability and action need to be taken at the root cause of the decline in bee colonies.

As the first year of working under this new strategy wraps up, growers may still have questions about how these changes will affect their operations. Here is an update and overview to help growers prepare for 2026.

Strategy Overview

The Endangered Species Act (ESA) has been in place since the 1970s; but in April 2022, the EPA began outlining its plan to meet ESA requirements. The primary focus has been on managing spray drift and runoff to reduce the risk of exposure to endangered species. The draft Herbicide Strategy was released in 2023 and finalized in 2024.

The new ESA language must now be included on labels beginning with new active ingredients and as actives are re-registered.

According to the EPA, the final strategy uses the most updated information and processes to determine whether an herbicide will impact a listed species and identify protections to address any impacts. Over time, all crop protection products will carry this language. The Insecticide Strategy was finalized this spring, and the Fungicide Strategy is still in development.

WinField® United has worked closely with industry associations, scientific organizations and our retail partners to advocate that the EPA’s decisions were grounded in sound science and that practical, workable solutions made it to the field.

Impacts on Growers

While there may be implications, this isn’t a fire drill. Not all product labels are immediately subject to the ESA or have the ESA language. It’s an ongoing integration process tied to new products and re-registration.

There are only a couple of labels that currently show the ESA language; and more than likely, it is not going to be a one-size-fits-all solution. Depending on the risk bucket and the characteristics of the product, growers may see different mitigations for drift and runoff as well as varying buffer lengths. How it is executed on each label may also be a little bit different.

As new products come out, growers should make sure to read the label and familiarize themselves with the new language ahead of the growing season.

Growers also may have to implement additional mitigation measures, such as spray buffers or conservation practices, to minimize environmental impact. They can get ahead of this by characterizing fields and identifying any existing practices that qualify as mitigations. We assume, for many growers, their fields may already check most of the boxes for the points needed.

A Simple Solution to Help Boost Herbicide Performance

If growers need a drift mitigation option for herbicides affected by the ESA, the new SuperLock™ adjuvant from WinField United fits the bill. This novel, single formulation combines a high surfactant crop oil concentrate with proprietary drift reduction technology. It is one of the only products on the market with this combination.

One of our goals was to provide another product that meets label requirements while effectively tackling the challenge of drift management. From an ESA standpoint, SuperLock adjuvant fits in the oil emulsion category, which is a drift-reducing adjuvant category currently approved under the Herbicide Strategy. This makes it a valuable tank-mix tool to help manage drift for many growers.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltdd43779342bd9107/blt55544e1947d08b8e/690c47f6b95521970fd20835/25-WIN-1273_CP-SuperLock-13_FEATURE_1920x1080.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-12-01 09:00:55.525336

Booming St. Thomas, buoyed by Volkswagen’s arrival, and gloomy Ingersoll, a town where General Motors has pulled in its horns, are a relative stone’s throw apart. Yet the two are worlds apart in the anxiety about the future – both excitement and worry – that’s sweeping Southwestern Ontario’s auto belt, a backbone of one of the province’s most important industries.

Much of the uncertainty stems from President Donald Trump’s push to bring manufacturing jobs to the U.S. from abroad, potentially disrupting a Canadian industry tightly integrated with the U.S. and Mexico. Before Trump’s return to the White House, and the trade tensions that followed his tariffs and threatened tariffs against American trading partners, Ontario built about 1.3 million vehicles a year mainly for export to the U.S.

The unique capabilities of iron-air batteries The primary limitation of lithium-ion technology is its duration.
By offering a duration that is orders of magnitude longer than conventional batteries, iron-air systems can replace fossil fuel peaker plants.
Iron-air batteries sidestep this scarcity trap entirely as they are made using only abundant, inexpensive materials – iron, air and water.","“The most exciting clean tech innovation of 2025? It might just be rust.”

That is the assessment of Mark Loveridge, Commercial Director of Renewable Exchange. But Mark’s enthusiasm doesn’t have anything to do with old bike chains or an oven in need of a deep clean.

Instead, people like Mark are getting very excited about the role that rust could play in mitigating climate change.

The problem with renewable energy systems as things stand is, unlike fossil fuels, renewable energies like solar and wind are difficult to store in the quantities we need.

This means that when the sun doesn’t shine and the wind doesn’t blow, energy supplies run low.

The renewable energy storage problem

For decades, the energy storage conversation has been ruled by the lithium-ion cell, a technology that powers everything from our mobile phones to electric vehicles.

But with 2025 drawing to a close, a chemically distinct contender has emerged from the laboratory to the electrical grid.

""After decades of dominance by lithium-ion, 2025 is potentially the turning point for long-duration energy storage (LDES), and iron-air batteries are leading the charge,"" Mark says.

The premise is elegantly simple, in the way that the world’s best inventions often are. These batteries harness the process of reversible rusting.

During discharge, the battery ""breathes"" in oxygen from the air which converts iron pellets into rust and releases energy.

To charge, an electrical current turns the rust back into metallic iron and the battery ""exhales"" oxygen.

The unique capabilities of iron-air batteries

The primary limitation of lithium-ion technology is its duration.

While excellent for short bursts of power lasting two to four hours, lithium-ion becomes prohibitively expensive when trying to bridge multi-day gaps in renewable generation.

This is where iron-air technology finds its niche.

""They're capable of storing energy for 100+ hours - enabling wind and solar to keep the lights on, even when the sun doesn’t shine or the wind doesn’t blow,"" Mark explains.

By offering a duration that is orders of magnitude longer than conventional batteries, iron-air systems can replace fossil fuel peaker plants.

""Ideal for grid-scale decarbonisation, especially during multi-day renewable lulls,"" Mark adds.

From theory to practice

The technology has moved rapidly from theoretical models to concrete infrastructure this year.

""This year, Ore Energy in the Netherlands delivered the world’s first grid-connected iron-air battery, and Form Energy in the US raised over US$400m to bring this tech to commercial scale,"" Mark says.

The Ore Energy pilot, connected to the grid in Delft in July 2025, represents a crucial proof of concept for the European market.

It demonstrates that these systems can be integrated safely into dense urban environments.

Across the Atlantic, Form Energy has operationalised its commercial-scale factory in Weirton, West Virginia, on the site of a former steel mill.

The company is currently fulfilling orders for major utilities, including Xcel Energy and Georgia Power, with projects expected to come online in late 2025 and 2026.

The geopolitics of abundance

Beyond the technical specifications, the iron-air battery offers a significant geopolitical advantage.

The transition to clean energy has often meant trading a dependency on fossil fuels for a dependency on rare earth minerals like lithium, cobalt and nickel – all of which are growing scarcer and more contested.

Iron-air batteries sidestep this scarcity trap entirely as they are made using only abundant, inexpensive materials – iron, air and water.

This abundance translates to stability and security for national energy strategies, reducing conflict and streamlining supply chains.

What’s more, the environmental profile of these batteries aligns closely with circular economy principles simply because their active materials are non-toxic and easily recyclable at the end of the system's life.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/924f9c4aec2cbdefa276e5955b807c30:de82df3e099ad2a5a538121a8fe9b10e/iron-air-battery-arrays-can-be-built-at-huge-scales.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 11:05:28.422173

Less than 20% of applications to the Innovation Fund are successful, according to the presentation.
Leon de Graaf of the Brussels-based consultancy Sustainable Public Affairs, said the Innovation Fund “clearly serves a purpose”.
The commission has estimated that about €40bn could flow from the ETS into the Innovation Fund by 2030.","The EU has only paid out a fraction of the money it says it has committed for green technologies, as companies spend up to 3,000 hours and an average €85,000 to access funds from a flagship programme.

Of €7.1bn awarded from the bloc’s Innovation Fund since it was established in 2021, only 4.7% has been paid out to companies because of the red tape required to access the money, according to European Commission figures.

The application process is also extremely lengthy and bureaucratic. In an internal presentation this month, seen by the Financial Times, the commission said that 77% of those seeking funding had to subcontract parts of the application process to consultants because of the “high burden”.

Average administrative costs were €85,000 per application, it said, even higher than the average €32,000 spent to access the EU’s research grant scheme, Horizon Europe.

Less than 20% of applications to the Innovation Fund are successful, according to the presentation. Of the projects that had been awarded grants, only 6% were operational, while 15 to 20% face delays.

The hold-ups in disbursing the funds are the latest example of how bureaucracy is stifling the EU’s competitiveness. In a major report last year, the former European Central Bank governor Mario Draghi said that administrative burdens were one of the main reasons for Europe’s “static industrial structure with few new companies rising up to disrupt existing industries or develop new growth engines”.

The Innovation Fund, which uses revenues generated from the bloc’s emissions trading system, is one of the world’s largest financing programmes “for the demonstration of innovative low-carbon technologies”, the commission claims.

It was touted as one of the main funding platforms to help the bloc compete with the US after former president Joe Biden announced $369bn of funding and tax credits for green technologies through the Inflation Reduction Act.

‘Very low success rate’

Victor van Hoorn, director of trade body Cleantech for Europe, said some businesses have reported spending 3,000 hours on applications to the Innovation Fund — if carried out by one person alone this would be equivalent to more than a year and a half based on the EU’s 36-hour average working week.

“The biggest challenge [we hear] is the amount of resources, the amount of documentation and all of that for a frankly very low success rate,” said van Hoorn.

Eoin Condren, executive director for corporate development at cement company Ecocem, said for its last application to the fund, it had an entire team dedicated to it for five months “costing hundreds of thousands of euros”.

“Large companies can absorb that, but smaller firms developing breakthrough technologies can’t,” he added.

Condren also noted that much of the money went to “big umbrella technologies like [carbon capture and storage] and green hydrogen . . . yet these large, often lossmaking projects are notoriously hard to finance, causing long delays in actually deploying funds”.

An EU official said the low payment rate reflected “the normal or expected implementation milestones for Innovation Fund projects”, adding that “first-of-a-kind projects generally also need more time to reach financial close, be built and enter into operation compared to, for example, research projects”.

“While the application process is demanding, it is also an opportunity to improve the project and the effort is commensurate with the size of the support that is offered,” the official added.

Difficult market conditions

Another issue with the fund is that market conditions in Europe make it difficult even for companies that receive grants to establish themselves and turn a profit.

Vianode, a company making low-carbon synthetic graphite for electric vehicle batteries, was awarded a €90mn grant in 2023 but decided not to go through with its European facility because of the flood of cheap Chinese graphite into the market. It instead set up in Canada, where it secured an offtake agreement with General Motors.

“In the end it comes down to what price you can compete for and with the Chinese dominance, the European market is very, very challenging for us now. It’s different in North America: there the battery producers have an incentive to choose non-Chinese,” said Andreas Forfang, vice-president for sustainability and public affairs at Vianode.

Leon de Graaf of the Brussels-based consultancy Sustainable Public Affairs, said the Innovation Fund “clearly serves a purpose”. Its application rounds were often several times subscribed, he said, adding that “the way the money is currently given is not fit for purpose”.

The commission has estimated that about €40bn could flow from the ETS into the Innovation Fund by 2030.

But van Hoorn said the small proportion that had so far been paid out showed that “most money is just sitting there due to complex milestones” resulting in a “huge opportunity cost” for the EU.",https://img.luxtimes.lu/public/luxembourg/3yre6k-2025-chevrolet-equinox-ev-front-left-4.26.25.jpg/alternates/SIXTEEN_NINE_1200/2025_Chevrolet_Equinox_EV_front_left_4.26.25.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 11:06:53.746728

As President Donald Trump nears the end of his second term’s first year, policies he’s implemented will affect how that plays out.

“They're really just taking a fine-tooth comb and looking at every single thing — whether that be justifiable, whether that be a knee-jerk reaction to, ‘Well this came out of the previous administration, so we want to see it,’” an EPA employee who works on water issues said while discussing how the Trump administration oversees the department.

Radio IQ is not identifying the federal employee — who’s been with the agency for more than 20 years — to protect them from potential retribution for speaking with media.

During the recent government shutdown, the employee said all functions of the department critical to public health remained in operation. They added that EPA leadership has been clear that the department will “be doing things that we are statutorily required to do.”

That doesn’t mean the tenor of the office hasn’t changed.

“Let's say, we've got a proposal or a project that is focused on providing resources and information related to climate change effects,” they said. “Instead of focusing on ‘climate change,’ let's talk about ‘extreme weather events.’ We've been talking [about] ‘sunny day flooding.’ … It's climate-change effects, but we don't just say the blanket term, ‘climate change.’”

Dozens of executive orders and federal policy changes have impacted funding for environmental initiatives, but the EPA employee said it’s going to take more time to see the real effects of those adjustments.

The changes are still being assessed in Virginia, too.

“We don't yet have that full picture of how all of the programs we rely on will be impacted,” said Adrienne Kotula, Virginia director of the Chesapeake Bay Commission, while discussing the impact of changing federal funding on cleanup measures. “We're certainly keeping track of it at the federal level on a case-by-case basis. But the full scope of everything is yet to be seen.”

Another unknown is the availability and accuracy of federal data; Kotula pointed specifically to information from the U.S. Geological Survey, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. She said the annual release of pertinent data is just beginning and she’d “start taking the longer view of what's available to us, and how we need to adjust moving forward — and whether or not that's necessary.”

In that vacuum, state lawmakers have begun prefiling proposed legislation for the upcoming General Assembly session that begins on Jan. 14. Among those bills are a few introduced by Democrats focused on energy efficiency and home weatherization, as well as allowing solar canopy requirements in some nonresidential parking developments.

In contrast, Republican lawmakers are aiming to repeal some restrictions on single-use polystyrene food containers and ease penalties on utilities if they’re unable to meet renewable energy portfolio standards.

Trump has maintained his policies will bring down utility bills, though recent data refutes that. The administration also has asserted lower gasoline prices are the result of its “commitment to American energy production.”

A former advisor to President George W. Bush recently told Politico that Trump “could claim an assist, not a total responsibility, for lower oil prices.”

“The actions that this administration is taking [has] set us back decades,” said Lee Francis, chief program and communications officer at the Virginia League of Conservation Voters, an environmental advocacy group. “The ‘One Big Beautiful Bill’ reversed almost entirely the Inflation Reduction Act, which is the biggest piece of climate legislation ever passed in our nation's history. And in doing so, it undermined … investment in Virginia, set us back years on our climate goals and is going to raise energy costs.”

Francis interpreted November’s election results to mean voters were concerned about affordability and energy costs, swinging control of state government to Democrats after four years under Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s administration.

After decades as a federal worker, the EPA employee seemed familiar with that kind of shift: “Every four years, it's going to swing back in the other direction to a certain extent … . Because that's what's going to happen. I mean, that always happens.”",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ecc3383/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3968x2083+0+281/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F90%2Fb7%2Fa2d7fea744be9fe5bebe5c14e93f%2Fap22073812303281.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 11:06:21.324062

The report provides recommendations for South Korea to mitigate supply chain carbon risks and strengthen the competitiveness of its tech industry.
Key measures include establishing a public-private supply chain carbon risk management system, improving access to renewable energy, and removing bottlenecks in Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) and the Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS).
Additional recommendations call for devising financial support through government-backed funds, tax rebates, and low-interest loans to address supply chain carbon risks, as well as developing a domestic ETS market and strengthening international decarbonisation initiatives.
For additional information: Navigating supply chain carbon risks in South Korea","Scope 1 emissions are associated with direct inputs to a production process and are under the control of a manufacturing company. Scope 2 emissions arise indirectly from purchased energy and inputs needed to produce a product, and Scope 3 emissions represent the embedded carbon from Scope 1 and 2 activities that were required to manufacture finished goods.

“The inclusion of indirect GHG emissions, such as Scope 2 and 3, could substantially increase supply chain carbon risks, including investment aversion, higher carbon cost exposure, and counterparty and reputational risks” said report author Michelle (Chaewon) Kim, IEEFA’s Energy Finance Specialist, South Korea.

IEEFA’s analysis shows that South Korea’s leading chip maker, Samsung Device Solutions (DS), recorded Scope 1–3 emissions of approximately 41 million metric tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO2e) in 2024 - the highest among seven major global tech companies — with a carbon intensity of 539 tCO2e per USD million of revenue.

Another South Korean chip manufacturer, SK Hynix, recorded a carbon intensity of around 246 tCO2e/USD million.

These emission levels compare unfavourably with those of the global Big Tech companies purchasing these chips. For example, Apple has a carbon intensity of around 37 tCO2e/USD million, while Google and Amazon Web Services (AWS) have carbon intensities of 67 tCO2e/USD million and 107 tCO2e/USD million, respectively.

These reflect their global strategies to maximise clean energy use and minimise GHG intensity across complete supply chains.

South Korea’s economy is highly dependent on international trade, which accounts for approximately 70 percent of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Intensifying supply chain carbon risks could significantly impact national economic viability.

The report examines how carbon regulations, including carbon taxes, emissions trading systems (ETSs), the European Union’s (EU) Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), and voluntary carbon management initiatives, could undermine South Korea’s export competitiveness by increasing domestic carbon costs.

Although semiconductors are currently exempt from the EU CBAM, and Scope 2 and 3 are omitted, their inclusion in the future could impose significant expense.

IEEFA estimates that South Korean chip importers could face approximately $588 million (KRW847 billion) in CBAM certificate expenses between 2026 and 2034.

“The sharp increase in CBAM costs may prompt European importers to switch their chip suppliers from high-emission South Korean producers to low-carbon suppliers” added Ms Kim.

IEEFA conducted a scenario-based case study, assuming the inclusion of semiconductors in the EU CBAM’s scope.

The analysis estimates the CBAM certificate costs using an Embedded Emission Factor (EEF) that covers the entire supply chain (Scope 1–3). It applies an embedded carbon intensity based on value rather than mass, using annual GHG emissions and revenues to determine the value-based EEF, reflecting the lightweight and high-value characteristics of semiconductors.

“An estimated $162 million (KRW233 billion) of CBAM certificate expenses could be incurred in 2034 under the high EU ETS scenario” said Ms Kim. This equates to 9.9 percent of the total chip exports to the EU.

Investors are increasingly excluding carbon-intensive companies from their portfolios, which could limit access to financing for high-carbon emitters, raising the cost of capital and reducing corporate valuations.

According to IEEFA’s analysis, if Scope 2 and 3 emissions were included in the South Korean ETS, Samsung DS’s carbon costs under the current 10 percent paid allocation system would be $26 million.

If free allowances are removed and companies pay 100 percent of their allocation in the future, the ETS expenditure could increase tenfold to $264 million.

Rising carbon costs in liquefied natural gas (LNG)-powered semiconductor clusters and fossil fuel-based Artificial Intelligence (AI) data centres could further increase counterparty risks and production expenses, particularly if LNG is later included in the CBAM scope.

High-emission companies risk exclusion from global supply chains. Countries heavily reliant on fossil fuels may also face the ‘exodus risk’ of companies relocating to more low-carbon-friendly nations.

Leading global tech companies are adopting low-carbon supply chain strategies to reduce indirect Scope 3 emissions, such as Apple’s Supplier Clean Energy Programme and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company’s (TSMC) Collective Procurement Programme.

The report provides recommendations for South Korea to mitigate supply chain carbon risks and strengthen the competitiveness of its tech industry.

Key measures include establishing a public-private supply chain carbon risk management system, improving access to renewable energy, and removing bottlenecks in Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) and the Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS).

Additional recommendations call for devising financial support through government-backed funds, tax rebates, and low-interest loans to address supply chain carbon risks, as well as developing a domestic ETS market and strengthening international decarbonisation initiatives.

As the demand for renewable energy solutions continues to surge, the industry is battling a widening skills gap that must be addressed quickly to meet global carbon emission goals.

In this blog, we delve into the pressing issue of talent shortages within the renewable energy sector, examining the causes, implications, and viable solutions to ensure companies and stakeholders are well-equipped to thrive in this rapidly changing industry.

The Energy Transition

The energy transition refers to the global shift from traditional, carbon-intensive energy sources to sustainable and renewable alternatives such as solar, wind, hydro, and geothermal. Governments, businesses, and communities are pushing this shift to cut emissions and fight climate change. As a result, the energy landscape is undergoing a significant transformation, as the diversification of energy sources calls for rapid industry growth.

This increased focus on renewable energy has created a surge in demand for skilled professionals with expertise in areas such as solar panel installation, wind turbine maintenance, energy storage systems, and grid integration. There’s a growing need for specialised talent to design, build, operate, and maintain renewable energy infrastructure. As a result, traditional energy companies, as well as new entrants in the renewable sector, are aggressively competing for a limited pool of qualified candidates.

The growth rate in the energy transition also outpaces the learning and development of candidates who lack the necessary skills and expertise. The evolution of technologies and regulations in the renewable energy space is forcing the industry to adapt quickly, often leaving a gap for professionals with up-to-date knowledge and qualifications. Equally, the retirement of experienced workers from the conventional energy sector and the inadequate pipeline of new talent entering the renewable energy workforce have made the shortage of skilled labour much more significant.

Advancing Technologies and Innovation

Advancing technologies and innovation in renewable energy have undoubtedly revolutionised the industry, but have also created a significant skills gap and talent shortage. Renewable technologies like solar, wind, and storage are evolving fast - faster than the workforce can keep up. capable of implementing, maintaining, and advancing these technologies. As a result, companies in the renewable energy sector are facing a shortage of qualified professionals with the necessary expertise to drive these innovations forward.

Traditional educational programmes and workforce development initiatives have struggled to keep pace with these changes, leading to a shortage of professionals with the right skills and knowledge.

Equally, the increasing complexity of renewable energy systems requires a multidisciplinary approach, combining expertise in engineering, data analytics, cybersecurity, and project management. This demand for a diverse skill set further exacerbates the talent shortage as companies struggle to find individuals with the necessary combination of technical, analytical, and strategic capabilities.

Navigating Talent Shortages to Ensure Secure Renewable Pipelines

According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, the world will need to create 14 million new renewable energy jobs by 2030 and move another 16 million workers to renewable energy roles. To grow sustainably, companies need to tackle the talent shortage head-on. . As the demand for renewable jobs continues to outpace the supply of skilled professionals, companies must focus on attracting, developing, and retaining top talent.

Investing and Nurturing Talent

Investing in specialised training programmes, partnerships with educational institutions, and apprenticeship initiatives can help build a pipeline of skilled workers equipped to meet the industry's evolving needs. Additionally, fostering a culture of continuous learning and professional development within the organisation can empower existing employees to upskill and adapt to the changing technological landscape.

Not only does this train any new recruits into the industry, but it also offers those in different sectors with a wealth of experience the chance to diversify from other energy industries and bring the skills and knowledge they already have to the renewable sector.

Time and cost are real concerns - but the sooner companies invest in training, the faster they’ll build a strong talent pipeline.. One of the key offerings that companies can provide is specialised technical training. Courses on solar power systems, wind turbine technology, energy storage solutions, and other renewable energy technologies equip individuals with in-depth knowledge. With this expertise, they can effectively contribute to the design, installation, and maintenance of renewable energy systems.

Learning and development can provide access to up-to-date information on industry standards, policies, and best practices, ensuring that talent is well-informed and compliant with industry requirements.

Mentorship and coaching programmes can also be invaluable for talent development. Companies can facilitate mentorship opportunities with seasoned professionals in the renewable energy sector, providing guidance and insight to support the career growth of less-experienced individuals.

Defining Company Culture

Defining a compelling employer brand and nurturing a distinct company culture can be the difference between attracting top-tier talent and falling behind the competition.

Renewable energy talent is drawn to organisations that cultivate a positive, inclusive, and supportive work environment. A company's mission, vision, and values should not just be words on paper but resonate authentically in every interaction and initiative.

Culture shapes every part of the employee experience—from hiring to retention. Prioritising cultural fit is paramount when it comes to renewable energy recruitment. During any talent acquisition efforts, companies should emphasise the importance of their culture and align it alongside the skills and experience they require to attract their ideal candidates.

EVP

An employer value proposition (EVP) encapsulates the unique rewards and benefits that differentiate a company from its competitors. By pinpointing organisational strengths, such as distinctive benefits, an inclusive company culture, unparalleled career growth avenues, or flexible work structures, companies can craft a compelling EVP that delivers an authentic look at what working life will be like for the next new employee.

EVP pairs closely with the employer brand. A robust employer brand celebrates diversity, champions innovation, and prioritises employee well-being. To attract top talent and potential hires, companies should prominently spotlight these attributes on their websites, social media, job descriptions, and throughout the interview process.

Note: An EVP is only as impactful as its reach. Ensure EVP permeates all company touchpoints, from job postings and websites to social media channels. An EVP that stands out can significantly amplify talent attraction strategy.

Authentic employer branding begins with the current workforce. Employees naturally evolve into brand ambassadors when they feel valued, engaged, and genuinely content in their roles. Their enthusiasm and pride amplify an employer brand, which will help companies build a reputation as a go-to employer within the industry.

One study found that around 70% of prospective employees would turn down job opportunities if the company offering the position had a bad reputation—even if they were out of work. This emphasises the need to invest in and uphold a stellar employer brand rooted in genuine employee experiences and organisational values.

Benefits also play a key role. These could include a competitive salary, bonuses, annual leave, health insurance, hybrid working, and more.

Streamlining Talent Acquisition Strategies

As competition for attracting top talent in the renewable energy recruitment space grows, streamlining the talent acquisition strategy is another step towards increasing your chances of hiring the people you require, whether permanent or contract.

Speed matters. In today’s market, delays can cost you the best candidates. By refining and accelerating the recruitment process, companies can swiftly identify, engage with, and onboard the best talent before competitors get there first.

Analysing the existing process and identifying any bottlenecks is key to speeding up the process. This could be the time it takes to get back to a candidate to offer them a position, potentially taking too long to post job specs or review candidate CVs. Once it’s been determined what could be costing the most time and resources, companies should optimise these without compromising the integrity of their hiring standards.

First impressions matter: As part of the strategy for attracting talent, it's crucial to remember that this is a candidate's first interaction with an organisation - and first impressions count. An efficient, organised, and transparent hiring process instils confidence in candidates and bolsters an organisation's reputation in the talent market.

Thinking about first impressions isn't just referring to the interview stage, where a company meets the candidate for the first time in person or through a virtual call. Their first impression could come at any moment, from renewable energy job specs, social posts, websites or through word of mouth. Ensuring a brand gives off the right impression across all channels is vital, as you never know when a candidate could be interacting with the company and gaining a first impression.

The Job Listing Experience

Streamlining the application process demonstrates respect for candidates' time and enhances their overall experience with the organisation. For in-demand talent, a seamless job process can be a decisive factor in choosing one employer over another.

Transparent job advertisements are crucial for attracting qualified candidates and building trust with potential employees.

By clearly outlining the job responsibilities, requirements, and company culture, transparent job adverts set realistic expectations and ensure that candidates understand what the role entails. This transparency not only helps attract candidates whose skills and values align with the position but also reduces the likelihood of mismatches and turnover, which in turn causes further delays in securing the best talent.

While job boards remain crucial to talent acquisition, the sheer volume can be overwhelming for active and passive candidates. Strategically selecting platforms that align with the renewable industry nuances and the specific roles being targeted will lead to a more robust talent pool better fitted to the required roles.

In today's digital age, leveraging social media also amplifies the reach of job posts. Platforms like LinkedIn, X, and industry-specific forums can serve as excellent channels to showcase job vacancies, reaching passive and active job seekers alike.

Attracting top talent is about being clear, specific, and compelling - right from the job post. . A well-articulated job description can be the first step in forging meaningful connections with potential hires, setting the stage for successful collaborations in the renewable energy industry.

Finding the Right Partner

For a company, getting talent acquisition right can be an impossible task. The specialised nature of roles within the renewable energy sector often demands candidates with a unique blend of technical expertise, industry-specific knowledge, and a deep understanding of sustainability practices. This requires a rigorous talent acquisition process, which many companies don’t have the time or expertise for.

A high-performing hiring team is instrumental in attracting top talent. Therefore, companies need to ensure their HR and recruitment teams are equipped with the necessary tools, training, and resources to execute their roles effectively.

Many organisations turn to recruitment process outsourcing (RPO) as a partner to support with talent acquisition. These organisations can offer their vast expertise to ensure these technical roles are filled quickly and compliantly. Often, they also have an extensive talent pool already.

A staffing provider can offer invaluable support to a company grappling with talent demands in several ways:

Specialised Recruitment Expertise: RPO providers are equipped with specialised knowledge and expertise in identifying and attracting top talent in various fields, including renewable energy. They can efficiently source, screen, and present qualified candidates, saving the company time and resources in the hiring process.

Access to a Diverse Talent Pool: These providers often have access to a vast network of professionals, including those with specialised skills in renewable energy technologies and sustainability. This can significantly expand the company's options and increase the likelihood of finding the right fit for their specific talent needs quickly.

Flexibility and Scalability: They can offer flexible staffing solutions to help companies manage fluctuating talent demands. Whether the need is for short-term project-based roles or long-term strategic positions, staffing providers can tailor their services to meet the company's evolving requirements.

Industry Insights: A reputable staffing provider with experience in the renewable energy sector can offer valuable industry insights, including salary trends, in-demand skills, and talent market dynamics. This information can guide the company in making informed decisions about its talent acquisition and retention strategies.

(TSX:NDM)(NYSE American:NAK) (""Northern Dynasty"" or the ""Company"") and its 100%-owned U.S.-based subsidiary Pebble Limited Partnership (""Pebble Partnership"") announce that the National Mining Association (""NMA""), the American Exploration & Mining Association (""AEMA""), the Alaska Mining Association (""AMA"") and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce (the ""Chamber"") have filed Amicus Briefs in the Alaska Federal Court in support of one of the largest undeveloped copper projects in the world, located in the U.S., which is being blocked by an illegal Obama/Biden veto.

""We appreciate the important support from the NMA, the AEMA, the AMA and the Chamber, as we fight back against the injustice of the illegal Obama/Biden-era veto,"" Ron Thiessen, Northern Dynasty President and CEO stated. ""The Obama EPA dreamed up this scheme to handicap future mining activity in the U.S., and the Biden EPA put this injustice into action without regard to the economic harm it could cause to all Americans.""

The NMA, AEMA and AMA summarize their argument with:

""…This case is exceptionally important to amici's members, the mining industry, and the nation's economy. The proposed mine-which the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (""EPA"") has unlawfully vetoed-will provide a crucial source of copper for construction, transportation, electrical and electronic projects, industrial machinery, and defense applications. Copper also plays an inextricable role in nearly all forms of renewable energy. The EPA's aggressive and unprecedented use of a regulatory veto comes just as the world prepares for a global shortage of copper and other minerals due to the surging demands of digitalization and electrification. While the United States has one of the world's greatest mineral repositories, the ability to get those minerals into the supply chain to help meet America's needs is threatened by crippling regulatory uncertainty, including the overly broad nature of EPA's asserted authority.

The misuse of EPA's veto authority casts a cloud over mining projects in Alaska and beyond. Regulatory obstacles to mineral development harm not only the U.S. mining industry, but also domestic manufacturing, innovation, and security… Amici and their members need certainty in the federal regulatory landscape governing mining operations and urge the Court to hold EPA to its statutory mandate and to prior interpretations and practice.""

Major arguments in the Chamber's brief include:

""…EPA vetoed a permit that is a crucial prerequisite for construction of the Pebble Mine...without considering the significant financial consequences of that veto for the project proponents, the State, and the national economy...""

""…Congress' instruction to EPA in Section 404(c)-that the agency evaluate whether effects are ""unacceptable"" before exercising backstop authority-is a paradigmatic demand that regulation proceed only after a reasoned consideration of costs. The statutory term ""unacceptable"" rivals those adjectives that the Supreme Court has already determined to ""naturally"" embrace a consideration of costs before an agency chooses to regulate…""

""…EPA ignored these principles by straining to read the word ""unacceptable"" out of Section 404(c). But the sheer ingenuity of the agency's reading underscores that it cannot be the ""best"" interpretation of Section 404(c) and therefore cannot justify EPA's decision…""

""…EPA's approach would turn the principles of reasoned decision-making inside out. It would encourage agencies not only to view the consequences of their actions through a keyhole-ignoring even sizeable costs of those actions-but also to shield that evaluation behind the Potemkin rationale of an ""alternative basis."" The upshot would be bad regulation badly explained. Nobody is well served when EPA erases a project of Pebble's magnitude and importance after (at most) feigning to check the price tag, and project developers, in particular, are likely to confront a chilled investment climate and other injuries to their reliance interests if the agency's approach is upheld…""

""...The Court should set aside EPA's veto and emphasize the importance of considering costs to determinations made under Section 404(c)…""

However, Alcolumbre scheduled a vote just hours after Lula nominated Attorney General Jorge Messias to the open seat on the Supreme Court.
After clearing the Senate, the bill now proceeds to the Lower House.
Other issues that could be challenged include the weakening of the National Public Security Fund (FNSP) and the funding of the National Anti-Drug Fund (FUNAD).
Despite talks about appealing to the Supreme Court, Lula often publicly argues that the government should avoid judicializing disputes.","The tense relationship between the Executive branch and Congress has led President Lula’s administration to reassess its strategy and increasingly see the Judiciary as a safe haven against potential setbacks imposed by lawmakers.

Recently, as tensions between the branches have escalated, the government has begun to consider bringing at least three cases to court after facing defeats in the Lower House and the Senate. However, this approach contradicts President Lula’s repeated message that the government should avoid litigation in politics.

One of the issues that may be brought to the Supreme Court is in the economic field. Last week, the Finance Ministry’s number two, Dario Durigan, indicated that the government is considering whether to go to court if Congress advances so-called “fiscal bomb” proposals—measures with severe negative effects on government finances.

His remarks came days after the Senate approved a supplementary bill with a multibillion fiscal impact that regulates the special retirement rules for community health agents and endemic-control workers. The bill guarantees these workers retirement at their last full salary (integrality) with adjustments equal to those granted to active civil servants (parity), and it establishes their own age and service-time requirements. The proposal is criticized by public-finance experts and is seen as a dangerous precedent for the sustainability of Brazil’s pension system.

Initially, the government was optimistic that the bill would not be brought to the floor by Senate President Davi Alcolumbre, who had been considered an ally of the Lula administration in Congress. However, Alcolumbre scheduled a vote just hours after Lula nominated Attorney General Jorge Messias to the open seat on the Supreme Court.

After clearing the Senate, the bill now proceeds to the Lower House. Some government members argue there is still room to negotiate the details, but they are also preparing for litigation amid rising tensions and no signs of de-escalation.

Although the Finance Ministry had already opposed the proposal, it passed without any dissenting votes or speeches, uniting members of both allied and opposition parties. In response, Durigan said on the 26th that the three branches “cannot throw everything away” after a joint effort by all institutions.

Another issue considered crucial for the administration is the environmental licensing bill. On Thursday (27), Congress overturned 52 of the 63 vetoes issued by Lula. The move was mainly driven by the agribusiness caucus and business sectors opposed to the vetoes. The government had long expected the possibility of the vetoes being overturned, but Congress postponed the session until after COP30—the climate conference held in Belém this month—in an attempt to minimize damage to the Legislature’s image.

A vote on the remaining vetoes was delayed indefinitely. As a result, most of the new Environmental Licensing Law—approved by Congress in July and criticized by environmentalists and the federal government’s environmental agency—now takes effect.

Lula is set to discuss the issue with the Environment Ministry and the Chief of Staff Office to explore legal options and potential actions. Environmental groups and left-wing parties have already threatened to bring the overturned vetoes to the Supreme Court.

A third proposal on the Executive branch’s radar is the anti-gang bill. The version drafted by rapporteur Guilherme Derrite was approved in the Lower House on the 18th, despite the government’s efforts to revise several parts of the report. The Planalto Palace now hopes to reverse the outcome in the Senate, but it already acknowledges, behind the scenes, that it has grounds to challenge key sections of Derrite’s report in court if the bill moves forward in its current form and reaches the president for signature.

The government’s main arguments are outlined in a report prepared by the Justice Ministry and obtained by Valor. The document states, for example, that the lawmaker’s proposal would violate the Fiscal Responsibility Law (LRF). Other issues that could be challenged include the weakening of the National Public Security Fund (FNSP) and the funding of the National Anti-Drug Fund (FUNAD). There is also debate over whether Derrite can redesign these constitutionally mandated security funds using ordinary law.

Turning to the courts is not new for the Lula administration. In July, at the president’s own request, the Attorney General’s Office (AGU) filed a petition with the Supreme Court to reinstate the decree that increased the Tax on Financial Transactions (IOF) rates. At the time, Messias argued that Congress violated the separation of powers by overturning an executive decree and that AGU’s only option was to “defend” the president’s autonomy.

Despite talks about appealing to the Supreme Court, Lula often publicly argues that the government should avoid judicializing disputes. At the start of his third term on January 27, during a meeting with governors, he said he would “work and talk extensively” to ensure each branch has the autonomy to carry out its functions. He then told party leaders to avoid “litigating politics.”

“We are responsible for so much litigation,” Lula said at the time. “When we lose something in Congress, instead of accepting the rules of democratic play—that the majority wins—we appeal to another branch to see if we can win there.” He added, “We need to stop doing politics this way, because it leads the Judiciary to intrude on the Legislative and start legislating in Congress’s place.”

In 2025, Lula reaffirmed that stance. At the opening of the 26th March to Brasília in Defense of Municipalities in May, he urged mayors and lawmakers to settle federal disputes “at the negotiating table, not in the courts.” He added: “Issues should only go to the Judiciary when our political capacity is exhausted—when we show ourselves unable to continue negotiating to find a peaceful solution.”

Despite the government’s apparent contradiction of turning to the courts, experts interviewed by Valor say the move makes sense when Congress violates the Constitution. “It is absolutely consistent to appeal to the Supreme Court, particularly when Congress pushes political issues forward in the face of constitutional prohibitions. One example is the conditional impossibility of granting amnesty,” said Fernando Augusto Fernandes, a researcher and attorney with a PhD in Political Science at the Federal Fluminense University (UFF). “We must distinguish litigation from the unconstitutional politicization of Congress’s relationship with the Executive branch,” Fernandes said.

“The acquisition is a strategic investment that will enable us to better serve semiconductor customers in Asia.
This ensures the product is process-capable and controlled enough for one of the most demanding manufacturing environments in the world: semiconductor manufacturing.
“Over the next five years, our goal is to be a global leader in electronic materials offering a broad materials portfolio to serve leading semiconductor customers.”","A global leader in advanced materials solutions, Materion Corporation (Materion) supports a variety of high-performance industries including telecom and data center, energy, automotive, semiconductor, industrial and aerospace. Built on a series of acquisitions, the company has nearly 100 years of expertise and has been known as Materion since 2011. It operates in three business segments – Performance Materials, Precision Optics, and Electronic Materials (EM).

Leo Linehan, President of EM, outlines how his sector is integral to delivering breakthrough solutions: “Materion’s EM business is a leading global supplier of thin film deposition materials, inorganic chemicals, and microelectronic packaging supporting a wide range of markets.

“Deposition materials make up more than 70 percent of EM’s business. Our product portfolio includes sputtering targets, evaporation materials, and precursor materials for atomic layer deposition (ALD). We are currently ramping production of these precursor materials to support ALD being used in high-performance memory and logic applications, which we’re really excited about.

“We’re also taking advantage of our recent acquisition of a site in South Korea to further grow our target business and give us a footprint close to semiconductor market leaders, allowing us to better partner with them.”

The transaction saw Materion purchase manufacturing assets for tantalum solutions from Konasol, a Korean manufacturer serving the semiconductor and adjacent markets. “The acquisition is a strategic investment that will enable us to better serve semiconductor customers in Asia. It included a newly constructed, state-of-the-art facility with specialized equipment used to produce fully finished tantalum sputtering targets.

“It also helps strengthen our position as a leading supplier of tantalum targets, increasing our capacity to supply critical high-growth deposition materials used in leading-edge semiconductor chips, including those used in high-performance computing and artificial intelligence applications.”

With its headquarters in Mayfield Heights, Ohio, Materion has a legacy of being a North America-based materials provider with manufacturing assets and capabilities across the globe. It employs more than 3000 people worldwide, serving customers in more than 60 countries and, as more reshoring takes place in the US and Europe, it has strategic locations close to customers in both regions.

Regarding manufacturing specifically, Leo says Materion often acts as the bridge from minerals that come out of the ground, with a wide spectrum of physical and chemical properties, to manufacturers: “In order to manufacture our products, we transform, refine and upgrade the materials using melting, pressing and other industrial equipment. This ensures the product is process-capable and controlled enough for one of the most demanding manufacturing environments in the world: semiconductor manufacturing.

“Our factories are a mix of new and old. We’ve completed a series of investments around new, cutting-edge manufacturing equipment, including some of the latest generation, fully automated production equipment. This new equipment has been designed for the demands of Industry 4.0.”

As suppliers to high-tech industries such as data centers and EVs, Materion collaborates closely with its customers when it comes to developing custom material solutions for their applications. Leo says: “We supply the materials that are deposited as thin films onto the semiconductor wafers that are used to support the construction and running of data centers, EVs and cloud computing. Essentially, we develop and provide the materials needed to ensure the optimal performance of semiconductors. Our research and development efforts center on partnering with customers to drive new product and technology innovations.

“Our customer relationships are of primary importance to our business and our production teams. The voice of the customer remains the guiding light in understanding how we can continue to improve and better serve them, as well as what opportunities we may have to meet their needs of tomorrow and beyond.

“We work with our suppliers the same way we work with customers: in close partnership. We work directly in their facilities, we visit them, and we maintain open communication to ensure quality and security of supply. Raw material quality and availability are critical to providing our customers with the high-quality materials they require.”

Alongside global acquisitions and technological advancements, Materion prides itself on the close relationships formed within the organization: “Our people are essential to the success of our business,” Leo explains. We take pride in cultivating and developing a strong sense of competitive spirit within our organization to drive results. We know it’s key to our success in the hyper-competitive semiconductor market. Our culture is rooted in our people and their ability to work safely to meet customer requirements.

“Furthermore, we like to think what sets us apart from competitors is the fact that we focus on fostering cross-functional connections across our customers’ organizations. We believe that the closer the relationships we have with our customers, the better we will be able to support their businesses. Time, speed to market and how rapidly we’re able to commercialize technology are critical in this industry, and we’re able to do this by working in close collaboration with our customers. We place great emphasis on our organization’s core values and our mission to be our customers’ partner of choice for their material needs.”

When asked about the company’s approach to sustainability, Leo describes Materion as being committed to sustainable business practices that ensure the wellbeing of its employees, customers and communities. Materion currently ranks among the top 35 percent of all companies assessed by Ecovadis for the topics of environment, labor and human rights, ethics and sustainable procurement. In addition, it has previously been recognized as a climate leader by USA Today.

“As part of our sustainability program, we support the Ten Principles of the United Nationals Global Compact,” Leo elaborates. “We are fully committed to complying with all applicable environmental laws and regulations and to the responsible use and management of natural resources, and we acknowledge our responsibility to manage operations in a way that minimizes greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and their impact on climate change.

“We are focused on continuing to implement sustainability strategies throughout the organization to reduce our product carbon footprint, increase our use of renewable energy resources, and improve engagement with our customers and stakeholders including CDP reporting and increased disclosures. Some examples of our sustainability programs include five of Materion’s sites using 100 percent green electricity; an increase in the number of sites using renewable energy resources, including solar panels, precious metals recycling programs that offer a circular economy for our customers, with 100 percent recycling for gold and tantalum materials, and partnering with our suppliers to ensure ESG compliance and traceability.”

Looking to the future, Materion is determined to keep building its customer relationships. “When we think about 2026 and beyond, we are committed to supporting our customers on new technologies being developed for the future AI, cloud-driven industry that’s developing,” concludes Leo. “As the world continues to rely more on AI and cloud computing, the need for new technologies and materials to support this rapid growth will be critical. We’re excited to play a role in the next generation of materials needed to power the world.

“Over the next five years, our goal is to be a global leader in electronic materials offering a broad materials portfolio to serve leading semiconductor customers.”",https://manufacturing-today.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/12/Materion-242-headline-image.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 08:00:26.275410

With a strategic vision aligned with Europe's commitment to sustainable electric mobility, the Moroccan government is taking significant steps to establish a secure and sustainable supply chain for electric vehicle battery manufacturing. In a recent interview with Platts, part of S&P Global Energy, Morocco's Minister for Industry and Trade, Ryad Mezzour, delved deeper into Morocco's ambitious plans and the strategies underpinning its ascent in the global battery industry. Please note that this interview has been edited for length and clarity.

Platts: Could you elaborate on how Morocco is positioning itself as a key player in global battery supply chains and the production of electric vehicles?

Ryad Mezzour: Our strategy originated from Europe's commitment to transition to electric vehicles (EVs) and sustainable mobility by 2035. Fifteen years ago, under the leadership of His Majesty [King Mohammed VI], we established a comprehensive ecosystem for car manufacturing, primarily targeting the European market. To remain competitive, we recognized the necessity of electrifying our production and integrating into the battery value chain. This journey began approximately six or seven years ago, during which we focused on developing the entire supply chain -- from raw materials to finished vehicles -- to meet the integration requirements for products exported from Morocco to Europe under our free trade agreement. We identified several key assets: abundant mineral resources, strong energy capabilities, competitive advantages, and a strategic response to commercial tensions at that time. Our strategy is clear: we have the capacity to produce 1 million cars annually and must ensure we can supply all necessary batteries. If we have excess production, we plan to deliver these batteries to our regional partners, effectively providing them with alternatives to the solutions currently available only in Asia. Our goal is to establish Morocco as a hub for producing battery components and electric vehicle batteries, encompassing the entire value chain rather than focusing solely on gigafactories.

Platts: What specific policies has the Moroccan government introduced to support this strategy?

Ryad Mezzour: We have created a global ecosystem to support all investments in Morocco. While there is no specific support program exclusively for batteries, we do offer competitive advantages. Firstly, Morocco is the world's leading reserve of phosphate, which aligns with the growing demand for lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) technology in batteries. The availability of phosphate and phosphoric acid makes Morocco a key player, as we are one of the largest exporters of these commodities. Secondly, we have strategically developed our renewable energy resources, allowing us to produce energy at competitive prices. In fact, Morocco stands out in this region for its competitiveness in renewable energy production. Additionally, we have a proven track record in manufacturing a wide range of complex materials, including fertilizers, automotive components, and even aircraft engines. This capability demonstrates that Morocco is an industrial country equipped to deliver sophisticated manufacturing solutions. When considering all these factors -- talent, energy resources, material availability, and world-class infrastructure -- Morocco is uniquely positioned to provide comprehensive solutions in this region.

Platts: Given the competitive landscape for investment, what incentives does Morocco offer to foreign companies, particularly in the areas of mining and battery manufacturing?

Ryad Mezzour: For mining companies, the most compelling incentive is access to abundant resources. This is a significant factor for investors. For manufacturing, we provide support in terms of infrastructure development and facilitating trade. In some cases, we can arrange co-investments with Moroccan partners, which helps foreign investors feel more secure, especially if they are unfamiliar with the local market dynamics. However, the incentives for the mining industry are generally less pronounced than for other sectors due to the inherent rights associated with resource access. We also offer some of the most competitive renewable energy rates available today.

Platts: What are Morocco's long-term goals for its battery industry? What specific milestones is the government aiming to achieve?

Ryad Mezzour: We have already begun exporting precursors since January 2025. By June 2026, we expect to produce our first battery cells and modules. Batteries are already being assembled in several of our original equipment manufacturers' (OEMs') plants. Additionally, we will have our first battery management systems, electrolytes, and separators ready early next year, with anodes expected by the second quarter. Our complete value chain will be operational to serve between 400,000 and 500,000 cars annually, potentially by the third or fourth quarter of 2026.

Platts: Does Morocco have the necessary ports, roads, and other infrastructure to support these projects, or will additional development be required?",https://www.spglobal.com/content/dam/spglobal/ci/en/images/platts/general/favicon.ico,N,,2025-12-01 14:01:01.652830

Fusion energy is the same sort that powers the sun. And, as the International Atomic Energy Agency has explained, nuclear fusion occurs when two light atoms combine to form a heavier atom, releasing a lot of energy.

If we could harness this reaction, we might be able to generate more of the energy we need while transitioning away from less sustainable sources. But there have been obstacles standing in the way of problem-free fusion development. For example, even the tiniest wisp of air can stop a fusion reaction, as experts noted in Power Magazine.

Now, Commonwealth Fusion Systems in Massachusetts says it is creating a container to keep a fusion reaction entirely airtight. The company has called this a ""vacuum vessel,"" describing the 48-ton steel container as ""instrumental,"" as CFS works toward ""large-scale commercial fusion energy."" As of late October, the first half of the vessel had been delivered.

""This is a really exciting time,"" said Brandon Sorbom, a CFS co-founder and its chief science officer, in a news release. ""It's a big moment for us because we have a big piece of hardware showing up, but it's also just a really big moment for the industry.""

While furthering fusion energy is an exciting prospect for many, researchers don't have all the kinks worked out just yet. There are still major obstacles to address in terms of sustaining and containing a fusion reaction that puts out more energy than it takes in — and doing so cost-effectively.

Nuclear fusion could one day create tremendous amounts of carbon-pollution-free electricity without the dangerous, long-lasting radioactive waste of today's nuclear fission reactors. But the technology to make a commercially viable fusion plant does not exist yet.

Still, if developers can effectively address these concerns, we could be looking at a more diverse and resilient energy mix down the line, with the potential to lower utility bills and mitigate the heat-trapping pollution that impacts air quality and drives rising global temperatures.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/YCxgJUclKNTooauw49c78w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_cool_down_737/109cafbf95cb2cf96d8a034fc6f38eb0,N,,2025-12-01 08:01:10.633941

Driver: Rapid digital substation deployment in accordance with IEC 61850 standards

The quick implementation of digital substations in accordance with IEC 61850 standards will lead to a major boost in the merging unit market globally. Since utilities and grid operators move digital substations, the demand for merging units, which collect and digitize analog signals of traditional instrument transformers, will drastically rise. Its growth is supported by the implementation of IEC 61850 Edition 2.1 that suggests the introduction of enhanced interoperability, real-time monitoring, and enhanced cybersecurity measures in mixed-vendor settings. Main solutions such as PCM600 and IET600 of Hitachi Energy are certified under this new edition, which simplifies the engineering and configuration of the digital substations, which enhances integration of merging units and its project implementation is quicker. Moreover, digital substations can provide high cost savings, safety improvement, and asset management. The shift to process bus architectures and virtualized protection and control systems continue to enhance the pace of merging unit implementation in upgrades and new projects in the brownfield. Other recent implementations have shown decreases in engineering labor, cabling downsizing, and increased reliability, which has enabled transition to the concept of unmanned substations and remote diagnostics. All in all, the increased pace of digitalization and greater IEC 61850 compliance is turning the merging units into the necessity of the present-day power grids.

Restraint: Limited technical expertise to support digital protection systems

One of the limitations on the integration of the unit market is the lack of qualified specialists familiar with the IEC 61850-based protection, sampling and substation automation. Most utilities, particularly in developing areas, do not have engineers who have been trained on the configuration, commissioning and maintenance of the sample-value systems. These skills cut short down the speed of digital substation projects, drives up commissioning expenses, and extends project schedules. Consequently, areas with untrained engineers might be reluctant to install digital substations in units of merging format, which restricts expansion in the market. In the case of merging units, this shortage of skilled workforce poses major obstacles. The misalignment between MU output and protection IED logic, the incorrect configuration of SV streams or poor time synchronization (PTP/IEEE 1588), as well as improper time synchronization between the volumetric signal and the protective relay itself may endanger the reliability of the system. Reports at utilities have been made at the Digital Substation forums, which have reported incidences of commissioning delays due to the lack of expertise in dealing with MU interoperability among vendors. This adds costs to the projects, protracts commissioning schedules, and reduces the level of trust in digital substitution adoption.

Opportunity: Massive retrofit potential in aging transmission & distribution infrastructure

The aging transmission and distribution (T&D) infrastructure worldwide presents a massive retrofit opportunity for the merging unit market. Many existing substations are based on legacy analog technology, which is costly to maintain, less reliable, and lacks the flexibility required for modern grid demands. Retrofitting these substations with digital elements such as merging units enables utilities to extend the life of their assets while modernizing essential functions without complete replacement. Merging units are critical in this retrofit trend by bridging the gap between conventional instrument transformers and the digital protection and control IEDs compliant with IEC 61850 standards. They convert analog signals from existing transformers into digital data streams transmitted over optical fiber or Ethernet-based process buses. This approach allows utilities to retain primary equipment while gaining the substantial benefits of digital substations, including enhanced safety, reduced wiring complexity, smaller physical footprint, and improved data accuracy for protection and monitoring. The retrofit potential is underscored by the urgency of upgrading aging grids to accommodate increasing renewable energy integration, decentralized generation, and smart grid functionalities. A fully digital or hybrid substation architecture increases system resilience, operational efficiency, and cybersecurity, and critical aspects as grids become more complex.

Challenge: Stringent cybersecurity requirements to protect merging units as critical interfaces in digital substations

Stringent cybersecurity requirements have become a major challenge for the merging unit market as digital substations increasingly rely on Ethernet based communication for protection and control. Merging units transmit high speed sampled value data and GOOSE messages, making them critical points in the substation’s communication chain. Research highlights that IEC 61850 communication, while efficient, was not originally designed with strong built in security. This creates vulnerabilities where attackers could spoof or manipulate sampled values or protection messages, potentially causing false trips, relay mis operations, or blocking protection functions. IEC 62351 provides guidelines for securing these communications through authentication and encryption, but many existing IEDs and merging units still lack full compliance, especially in real time environments where even milliseconds of delay can compromise system performance. Implementing cybersecurity in process bus networks adds further complexity for utilities and vendors. Adding cryptographic protection can introduce latency, requiring merging units to balance security with the strict timing needs of protection systems. In addition, utilities must deploy certificate management systems, secure key handling processes, and continuous monitoring to protect multivendor IEC 61850 systems. This significantly increases cost and engineering effort, particularly in regions where OT cybersecurity expertise is limited. As a result, the need to meet rigorous cybersecurity demands slows down merging unit adoption and complicates digital substation deployment.

Electric luxury cars have become more attainable due to the increasing availability of high-end EV models across rental and ownership markets. Many travelers explore these cars during their stay, which also contributes to rising interest. Editorial sources often mention platforms such as the GTR Luxury official site, where enthusiasts learn about premium vehicle options as part of their planning. This exposure helps more people experience electric mobility without committing to long-term ownership.

Government Initiatives Accelerate Adoption

The UAE government has played a significant role in encouraging electric vehicle usage. Free parking incentives, toll exemptions, and charging infrastructure expansions have all influenced buying and renting decisions. Dubai alone has installed hundreds of public charging points through DEWA’s Green Charger initiative, making EVs more practical for daily use. These measures create a supportive ecosystem where luxury electric models can thrive.

Charging Infrastructure That Supports Seamless Use

A strong reason behind the rise of electric luxury cars is the rapid development of charging stations across the country. Residents can find chargers in malls, residential communities, business districts, and hotels. Locations such as JBR, Dubai Hills, and City Walk have made charging accessible to both residents and tourists. This infrastructure reduces range anxiety and gives drivers confidence to use EVs for longer routes, including trips to Abu Dhabi, Sharjah, and Fujairah.

Performance That Matches and Sometimes Exceeds Traditional Supercars

Modern electric luxury cars outperform many conventional supercars in acceleration and handling. Models like the Tesla Model S Plaid and Porsche Taycan Turbo S deliver instant power with no engine noise. This appeals to drivers who appreciate performance but prefer a more refined, futuristic feel. The smooth roads of Dubai especially Al Khail Road, SZR, and the long stretches near Expo City make EV performance even more enjoyable.

A New Aesthetic for Social Media Culture

Electric cars carry a distinct visual identity. Their clean lines, LED lighting signatures, and minimalist interiors make them appear futuristic in photographs. Influencers and travelers often showcase EVs at locations such as Bluewaters Island, Museum of the Future, and Palm West Beach. This association with modern design contributes to their popularity, especially among younger demographics who value visual storytelling.

Lower Operating Costs and Practical Daily Use

Although luxury EVs come at a premium price, their operating costs are relatively lower. Electricity is cheaper than fuel, and electric motors require less maintenance than traditional engines. For daily commutes between Marina and Business Bay or frequent drives to Abu Dhabi, EVs offer a cost-efficient alternative while maintaining luxury. This economic practicality appeals to long-term residents and business executives.

Corporate and Fleet Adoption

Companies in the UAE are also introducing EVs to their fleets as part of sustainability commitments. Hotels, private chauffeur companies, and business groups increasingly choose electric luxury sedans and SUVs to align their brand image with future-forward values. This corporate shift further normalizes EV usage across the country.

A Strong Future Outlook

With each passing year, more luxury EV models enter the UAE market. BMW i7, Mercedes EQS SUV, Audi e-tron GT, and Lucid Air are gaining traction among early adopters. New charging corridors and city-wide sustainability programs suggest that EV usage will continue rising. Dubai’s commitment to smart mobility drone taxis, autonomous vehicle testing, and AI-powered traffic systems shows that electric transport fits naturally into the country’s long-term vision.

The growing popularity of electric luxury cars in the UAE reflects a blend of lifestyle evolution, technological progress, and nationwide sustainability goals. With strong infrastructure, attractive incentives, and high-performance models entering the market, EVs are becoming an integral part of the country’s modern driving culture. Their presence on the roads signals a shift toward a cleaner and more futuristic mobility experience.",https://www.cuindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/word-image-13675-1-1024x576.png,N,,2025-12-01 12:04:41.075305

Climate change requires coordinated international responses. Between 2021 and 2023, weather- and climate-related disasters cost an estimated $182.7 billion in the U.S. and $162 billion in the EU. Yet political divisions continue to impede transatlantic climate adaptation, particularly as U.S. federal engagement has stalled and climate change policy grows increasingly contested. For example, the Environmental Protection Agency’s core functions—regulating pollution, conducting environmental research, enforcing compliance, supporting state programs, responding to environmental hazards, and protecting public and environmental health—have been sharply curtailed under the new administration. At the 2025 United Nations General Assembly in September, President Trump called climate change policy “the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world.” With such open rejection of scientific evidence and the international climate consensus, federal-level transatlantic cooperation appears unlikely.

However, subnational diplomacy has proven remarkably resilient. At the same UN General Assembly, California Governor Gavin Newsom met with numerous international officials, including EU Climate Commissioner Wopke Hoekstra, to reaffirm state-level climate commitments and explore deeper transatlantic cooperation. This outreach illustrates how subnational actors can sustain climate progress even when federal leadership falters. This article therefore proposes a new framework to harness and enhance such collaboration.

A New Framework for Collaboration

In an era of political uncertainty, subnational partnerships between U.S. states and the EU offer a promising alternative channel for climate cooperation. This article introduces the Transatlantic Subnational Resilience Framework (TSRF), a novel approach aimed at strengthening climate adaptation efforts and delivering tangible benefits even in periods of U.S. federal inaction. Subnational actors are already engaging European partners, often with meaningful, if uneven, results that demonstrate both the promise and the limits of decentralized climate diplomacy. A compelling example is the cooperation between California and the European Union during the first Trump administration. In 2018, the European Commission and California signed a Memorandum of Understanding on emissions trading and clean energy, which led to regular technical exchanges, joint workshops on carbon markets, and continued alignment on vehicle emissions standards even as U.S. federal policy moved in the opposite direction. This partnership not only preserved transatlantic policy learning during a period of federal retrenchment but also helped stabilize global confidence in subnational climate leadership. Beyond this case, numerous other initiatives illustrate the emerging architecture of subnational engagement: California’s recent partnership with Denmark on green economy resilience; coalitions such as We Are Still In and the U.S. Climate Alliance; EU-backed initiatives such as the Global Covenant of Mayors and the International Urban Cooperation (IUC), and global networks that include US and EU actors such as the Under2Coalition or the Coalition for High Ambition Multilevel Partnerships (CHAMP) for Climate Action.

Yet these efforts often remain fragmented, underfunded, and institutionally fragile. Entrenched partisan polarization makes consistent federal climate leadership increasingly unlikely. A shift toward “diagonal cooperation”—collaboration between subnational U.S. actors and European regional or supranational entities—is therefore crucial. Backed by the EU and driven by U.S. states, regions and cities, the TSRF could synchronize existing networks such as the Transatlantic Climate Alliance and elevate overlooked initiatives like wildfire prevention and flood control. Subnational diplomacy, which means linking U.S. states, cities, private actors, and EU partners, offers a viable path forward. The TSRF would institutionalize and scale these efforts through a permanent governance anchor capable of tracking commitments, coordinating partnerships, and sustaining innovation across the Atlantic. Before outlining such an institutional backbone, the article turns to sectoral examples that illustrate foundational components of the TSRF.

Sectoral Examples Illustrating TSRF’s Potential

Flood Control and Coastal Protection: Learning from the Dutch Dialogues

Flooding endangers coastal and riverine communities across the Atlantic, yet subnational partnerships have already shown how local actors can connect global expertise to local needs. The Netherlands—renowned for its ability to hold back the North Sea—has become a global leader in water management, and has exported its expertise to flood-vulnerable U.S. states.

After Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans in 2005, disproportionately affecting lower-income communities and communities of color, Dutch officials invited Louisianan leaders to tour the Netherlands’ flood management systems to prevent future devastation. This exchange laid the foundation for the Dutch Dialogues: workshops between Dutch engineers and U.S. city planners that reimagined New Orleans’ relationship with water management and strengthened the resilience of at-risk communities. These workshops generated green infrastructure ideas such as wetland restoration and expanded drainage basins, which now shape New Orleans’ current resilience strategy. Similar approaches have since been adopted in Charleston, South Carolina, and Virginia’s Hampton Roads region.

These exchanges show the value of subnational partnerships. Cities like Charleston can collaborate directly with Dutch water authorities and U.S. academics without awaiting federal action. A TSRF would provide sustained support through structured coordination, funding opportunities, and formal governance to ensure durable cooperation beyond shifting political landscapes. A standing Transatlantic Resilience Advisory Committee, composed of regional U.S. officials and EU diplomats, could meet regularly to evaluate pilot proposals, oversee city-to-city partnerships and maintain ongoing transatlantic dialogue. By embedding coordination within an institutionalized forum rather than relying on one-off exchanges, the TSRF would shift collaboration from episodic inspiration to sustained resilience-building.

To support this, the TSRF would create a central coordination mechanism—potentially hosted by EU member states or the European External Action Service. The hub would not impose top-down rules; rather, it would identify shared risks, pool knowledge, and support joint adaptation strategies. U.S. municipalities seeking Dutch-style flood management tools could access EU technical expertise, apply for co-funding from EU adaptation instruments, and obtain logistical support for workshops or site visits. By offering continuity even as U.S. federal priorities shift, the TSRF would sustain long-term, resilient partnerships.

Wildfire Resilience: Shared Strategies from California to the Mediterranean

Wildfires offer another striking example of how the TSRF could enhance cooperation. Both North America and Europe now face increasingly severe fire seasons fueled by climate change. In 2020, California wildfires emitted smoke plumes that crossed the Atlantic; in 2022, 20 EU member states recorded above-average burned areas, including significant fires in Germany, the Czech Republic, and beyond.

Despite these shared challenges, transatlantic wildfire collaboration remains fragmented. The TSRF could facilitate subnational partnerships between wildfire-prone states such as California and European counterparts like Spain, Greece, and Portugal. These partnerships could focus on early warning systems, data exchange, forest management, and firefighting techniques. For example, the EU’s Copernicus Emergency Management Service generates satellite wildfire maps on demand; under the TSRF, U.S. state wildfire agencies could access these during major fire events. Likewise, California’s ALERT California camera network—an AI-enabled early detection tool—could be shared with European civil protection agencies. Sector-specific transatlantic working groups could link California’s Cal Fire with Greece’s fire service to exchange best practices in real time. Such peer-to-peer cooperation would save lives and property, while strengthening public support for climate partnerships despite national political tensions. A governance hub within the TSRF would ensure these partnerships become institutionalized and consistent rather than dependent on individual administrations or crises.

Building Institutional Backbone: An EU-Coordinated Governance Hub

For the TSRF to endure, it must be supported by sustained coordination that can weather fluctuations in U.S. federal policy. A governance hub housed within the European External Action service could serve as this backbone, centralizing progress in two ways.

First, it could track subnational commitments through a publicly accessible registry of climate-resilience pledges by city, state, and region. Beyond simple self-reporting, this system would integrate progress indicators, timelines, and metrics drawn from existing EU adaptation frameworks, enabling more meaningful dialogue with subnational U.S. actors about implementation gaps and opportunities. This effort could incorporate existing networks such as the Climate Alliance and America Is All In, giving subnational initiatives stronger international institutional connections and implementation capacity.

Second, the hub would facilitate structured exchanges and serve as a clearinghouse for technical expertise, partnership matching, and knowledge transfer. It would link wildfire agencies, coastal resilience offices, emergency-response teams, and local disaster-management units across the Atlantic. This structure would move cooperation from informal networking to institutionalized exchange.

Scaling Peer-to-Peer Cooperation: Transatlantic Innovation Exchanges

The TSRF could formalize “climate resilience twinning” arrangements, modeled on sister cities but focused on adaptation rather than cultural exchange. Pairing EU cities or regions with U.S. counterparts that face similar climate risks, such as matching a flood-vulnerable U.S. coastal community with a European city pioneering nature-based flood defenses, would create sustained channels for peer learning and policy transfer. Fellowships, staff exchanges, and recurring Resilience Dialogues would bring stakeholders together to share data, test approaches, and co-develop solutions. These connections would help cooperation persist beyond electoral cycles and enable long-term planning despite federal uncertainty.

Financing Action: A Joint Resilience Investment Fund

To convert plans into action, the TSRF should be backed by a Joint Resilience Investment Fund designed to attract private capital. The recent Clean Investment Monitor Update estimates that U.S. clean energy and transportation investment reached $68 billion in the second quarter of 2025, holding steady relative to 2024 and accounting for 4.8% of total private investment in structures, equipment, and durable goods—indicating substantial private investment capacity.

The fund could mobilize additional private capital from both sides of the Atlantic and support climate-resilience startups and public-private pilot programs. This would provide financial continuity less vulnerable to shifts in federal funding and further embed transatlantic economic collaboration within the TSRF.

Conclusion

In today’s volatile political environment, transatlantic climate resilience requires innovative cooperation beyond traditional U.S.-EU diplomacy. As the climate crisis accelerates, cooperation must adapt and evolve accordingly. Local and regional actors have demonstrated that they can sustain collaboration in politically unstable times. The Transatlantic Subnational Resilience Framework offers a way to institutionalize this momentum by connecting cities, states, and private actors across the Atlantic through a durable framework that shares goals, builds knowledge, and mobilizes resources.

This alliance is not only feasible, it is already emerging in sectoral pockets. What is missing is the connective institutional tissue to coordinate and deepen these partnerships to align them into a more integrated transatlantic resilience agenda, which could spill over into other areas of climate change policy. The TSRF can transform fragmented initiatives into a cohesive resilience strategy, reinvigorating the U.S.-EU relationship and linking communities in a shared mission to confront a profound challenge of our time.

Doral thus increased its stake in the US company to 36%, with an option to buy a further 5% later.","The share price of renewable energy company Doral Group Renewable Energy Resources (TASE: DORL) has risen by over 20% in the past two days, and in the past year it has risen by over 140%, leaving its cleantech competitors far behind. The sectoral index has risen by just 25% in the past year.

Owners become billionaires

In fact, since releasing its quarterly financials, Doral added almost NIS 1 billion to its market cap in two sessions, to reach NIS 5.5 billion. The big gainers are of course the founders, chairperson Doron (Dori) Davidovitz and Alon Kesel, each of whom holds 19% of the company. The recent jump in the share price added about NIS 200 million to the value of each of their holdings, bringing them close to being shekel billionaires, on paper.

What impressed investors so much in Doral’s financials? Although the company still posts losses, it presents more than 50% growth in revenue. But two pieces of positive news encouraged the market. The first is to do with taxation, the second with guidance, and both are connected to the question whether Doral has had the luck to be in the right place at the right time.

Right place: the US. The scope of Doral’s projects there is huge, and already amounts to 7.7 gigawatts. For the sake of comparison, that is just over half the power consumption of the entire State of Israel at the peak of the winter season. In addition, projects that could yield another 2.5 gigawatts are expected to start construction in the coming year and to be connected to the grid in by the end of 2027. All this is in the red-hot US market, where demand for energy, particularly solar energy, is expected to be dramatic in the coming years.

Right time: Doral is expected to complete these projects just before the expiration of the tax breaks for renewable energy developments in the US. Leader Capital Markets analyst Gilad Ben-Zvi says, ""In the previous financials they reported only 2.5 gigawatts that they were certain would qualify for the tax breaks, and following recent developments they are now able to provide another level of certainty for investors on the large scope of mature projects that they will manage to connect.

""There’s a very strong environment at present in the US energy market, because of the considerable rise in demand for power in the coming years from new server farms and the substantial consumption of electricity for artificial intelligence.""

Doral is considered to be in a good position in relation to US companies as well, since it is expected to manage to connect new projects, and apply the tax breaks to them, while its competitors are still standing in line to connect to the grid.

""They’ll need a lot of money to meet the guidance""

RELATED ARTICLES

The combination of the tax breaks, the acceleration of projects, and the company’s unique positioning, have led Doral to issue optimistic guidance. The projects in the US will yield EBITDA of over $850 million a year from 2029, which compares with $61 million in the first nine months of 2025, and just $10 million in 2024. But what are the chances of meeting this fantastic guidance?

In order to maximize profits, Doral increased its position in US subsidiary Doral Renewables LLC by buying 10% of its shares from US partner/CEO Nick Cohen for $67 million. Doral thus increased its stake in the US company to 36%, with an option to buy a further 5% later. Incidentally, former Mossad chief Yossi Cohen serves as a director on Doral’s behalf in the US company, and holds options on its shares estimated in the past to be worth tens of millions of shekels.

There are, however, several question marks over Doral’s optimistic forecast. ""There is still uncertainty about the company’s ultimate value,"" says Leaders Ben-Zvi, adding ""we are still waiting for the next offering.""

Doral, he says, is still a company short of cash, and in order to finance its wave of construction ""they will need a lot more money, which will come from raising capital or even an IPO in the US. But the current deal gives a floor to the company’s value, and that’s what provided a following wind for the stock.""

Of course it remains to be seen whether the positive investor sentiment is maintained, and whether Doral will abide by its dramatic promises in the US market.

Electric vehicles now account for nearly 90% of lithium demand, up from 64% in 2020, with global EV sales expected to exceed 20 million units in 2025. The energy sector accounted for 85% of total battery metals demand growth over this period.

Indonesia accounted for over half of nickel mining in 2023, while China is responsible for 80% of graphite mining and over 90% of refining. The average market share of the top three refining nations for key energy minerals rose from around 82% in 2020 to 86% in 2024, creating vulnerabilities that Western governments are addressing through diversification initiatives and domestic production incentives.

Indonesia's share of mined nickel production has risen from 16% in 2017 to around 50% in 2023, with Indonesia's total nickel pig iron production reaching approximately 1.85 million tonnes in 2024 and expected to reach around 2 million tonnes by 2025, accounting for 53.5% of global primary nickel production. This dominance creates both supply security concerns and pricing power dynamics.

Recent market action demonstrates ongoing volatility, with lithium carbonate futures in China experiencing dramatic swings. Exchange regulatory measures imposing stricter trading rules and supply-side signals from production restarts contributed to a 9% single-session drop to ¥91,020/tonne after peaking at ¥102,500/tonne. Despite near-term corrections, underlying demand tied to electrification remains robust as battery gigafactory construction accelerates globally.

Western governments are prioritizing supply chain diversification through comprehensive policy frameworks. The U.S. Inflation Reduction Act, Canada's Critical Minerals Strategy, and Australia's Modern Manufacturing Initiative provide tax credits, loan guarantees, and offtake support for domestic battery metal production, reducing project financing risk and creating government-backed demand for Tier-1 jurisdictional assets.

The Battery Metals Imperative

The global transition to electrified transportation and renewable energy storage is creating structural demand for critical minerals essential to battery production. Nickel, lithium, graphite, copper, and tin have emerged as foundational commodities enabling the shift away from fossil fuels, positioned at the intersection of climate policy, technological innovation, and supply chain security. The investment thesis for battery metals rests on fundamentals distinct from traditional commodity cycles. Policy-driven demand supported by government mandates and emissions regulations provides visibility extending through 2030, while supply responses remain constrained by permitting timelines, capital intensity, and geopolitical concentration.

Global Trends Driving Battery Metals Demand

The electrification of transportation represents the primary demand catalyst for battery metals, with penetration rates exceeding forecasts. EV sales surged past 7 million units in the first half of 2025, a 28% year-over-year increase, with the International Energy Agency projecting full-year sales could approach 20 million units. Major automotive markets have established regulatory timelines phasing out internal combustion engines by 2035, creating policy certainty driving massive capital investment across automotive supply chains.

Battery chemistry evolution reshapes demand profiles for individual metals. Nickel-rich cathode chemistries maximize energy density and vehicle range, driving nickel intensity per vehicle upward. Batteries, the heart of every electric vehicle, rely heavily on lithium, cobalt, nickel, manganese, and graphite as key cathode and anode materials. Each EV requires approximately 50-100 kilograms of graphite depending on battery size, while copper content increases dramatically versus combustion vehicles due to electric motors, battery systems, and charging infrastructure.

Energy Storage & Grid Applications

Grid-scale energy storage is emerging as a complementary demand driver, with battery installations required to manage intermittency from renewable generation. Battery energy storage system installations are set to increase from 205 GWh in 2024 to 520-700 GWh by 2030, a 2.5-3.5x increase. Residential and commercial storage applications add another demand layer, with home battery systems gaining adoption in markets with high electricity costs or time-of-use pricing. These distributed storage applications utilize similar lithium-ion chemistries to EVs, competing for the same battery metal supply.

Supply Chain Reshoring Imperatives

Geopolitical tensions have elevated supply security to strategic priority for Western governments and automakers. In 2023, Australia, Chile and China mined about 85% of global lithium, with almost 65% refined in China and another 25% in Chile. Indonesia accounted for over half of nickel mining, while the Democratic Republic of Congo was home to almost two-thirds of the world's cobalt mining. The U.S. Inflation Reduction Act's domestic content requirements for EV tax credits, Canada's Critical Minerals Strategy, and the European Union's Critical Raw Materials Act all prioritize domestic or allied-nation sourcing, creating structural demand for battery metal projects in stable jurisdictions at premium prices.

Supply Challenges: Commodity-Specific Constraints

The nickel market is experiencing supply transformation as Indonesian production dominates global output. In 2023, Indonesia accounted for 53.1% of the global nickel supply and was projected to reach 2.1 million metric tons by the end of 2024. However, this creates market vulnerabilities. The global primary nickel market is expected to remain oversupplied in 2025, with production from Indonesia forecast to expand further despite challenges like tight nickel ore availability and potential royalty rate hikes.

Battery sector dynamics add complexity, as the battery sector saw a shift in preferences from nickel-rich nickel-manganese-cobalt batteries toward nickel-free lithium-iron-phosphate batteries, driven by price competitiveness. Despite this, the battery sector is expected to increase nickel consumption to 543,000 tonnes in 2025, making up 15.2% of global consumption. Nickel sulphide deposits in stable jurisdictions command premiums as automakers seek long-term, low-carbon supply agreements outside concentrated Asian supply chains.

Lithium: Price Volatility Masking Structural Growth

Lithium markets navigate the aftermath of speculative excess. Recent price action illustrates ongoing volatility, with lithium carbonate futures experiencing dramatic swings following exchange regulatory measures and production restart announcements. A major mine with potential output of approximately 46,000 tonnes per year, roughly 3% of projected global supply, exemplifies how quickly brownfield supply can respond to price signals.

Despite near-term volatility, lithium prices dropped nearly 20% in 2024, reaching similar prices to late 2015 levels, despite lithium demand in 2024 being about six times bigger than in 2015. The IEA warns that low prices could discourage future investments and might cause supply shortages for lithium and nickel by 2030. Greenfield lithium projects face extended permitting timelines and infrastructure development requirements, meaning supply responses to sustained higher prices will lag by years.

Graphite and Other Critical Minerals

Graphite supply is even more concentrated, with China responsible for 80% of mining and over 90% of refining. Natural flake graphite must undergo purification, spheronization, and coating processes to meet battery anode specifications, requiring specialized facilities and technical expertise concentrated in China. Western graphite projects must demonstrate integrated processing capability to produce battery-qualified material, adding capital intensity and technical risk beyond conventional mining operations.

Company Case Studies

Canada Nickel's Zero-Carbon Nickel Production (TSXV:CNC)

Canada Nickel is advancing the Crawford Nickel Sulphide Project in Ontario's Timmins region, positioning the asset as potentially one of the world's first zero-carbon nickel mines. The company recently secured an oversubscribed financing to advance engineering, permitting, and development activities.

As CEO Mark Selby stated their offering options:

""The Offering is oversubscribed. The Underwriters intend to fully exercise the Over-Allotment Option… If the Over-Allotment Option is exercised in full, the gross proceeds of the Offering will be C$15.0 million.""

The proceeds support steps toward a construction decision targeted for 2026.

Crawford ranks as the world's second-largest nickel reserve and is expected to become the third-largest nickel sulphide operation globally based on feasibility study production rates. The deposit contains over 1.7 billion tonnes of reserves supporting a 41-year mine life, with life-of-mine cash costs of US$0.39/lb positioning Crawford in the first quartile globally. Updated FEED optimization improved after-tax NPV to US$2.8 billion with IRR exceeding 17%.

The decarbonization strategy through carbon sequestration, demonstrating 1.5 million tonnes CO₂ storage annually through IPT carbonation with potential scaling to 10-15 million tonnes via NetCarb Alliance, could position Crawford as a supplier of zero-carbon nickel to automakers with stringent emissions requirements. The broader Timmins Nickel District encompasses 42 km² with multiple discoveries including high-grade intercepts at Bannockburn showing 3.95% nickel over 4 metres, suggesting district-scale growth potential beyond Crawford alone.

Sovereign Metals (AIM:SVML) : Rutile-Graphite By-Product Economics

Sovereign Metals is developing what it describes as the world's largest known rutile resource and second-largest known flake graphite resource in southeastern Africa. As the company notes:

""Kasiya holds 17.9 Mt of contained rutile (world's largest) and 24.4 Mt of contained graphite (world's second-largest).""

The unique aspect is that graphite emerges as a natural by-product of rutile mining, creating economics distinct from standalone graphite projects.

The Optimised Pre-Feasibility Study demonstrates pre-tax NPV of US$2.32 billion with 27% IRR, supporting steady-state production of 246,000 tonnes per annum rutile and 265,000 tonnes per annum graphite. Processing advantages stem from soft saprolite ore enabling simpler methods than hard-rock graphite peers, producing higher carbon concentrate at 96-98% versus typical 94-95%, while achieving up to 57% large-jumbo flake commanding premium prices.

The by-product economics create competitive advantages, with incremental graphite production cost of US$241/tonne sitting below Chinese weighted average cost of US$257/tonne, positioning Sovereign in the lowest-cost quartile on global cost curves. A successful 6-month pilot operation mining 170,000 cubic meters validated the full production chain, informing feasibility parameters and de-risking execution. With Definitive Feasibility Study expected in Q4 2025, Sovereign is advancing toward financing and construction decisions.

Fitzroy Minerals (TSXV:FTZ): Dual-Track Copper Strategy

Fitzroy Minerals pursues a dual-track copper strategy in Chile's premier copper belt, combining fast-track oxide development for near-term cash flow with deeper sulphide exploration for long-term scale. The company recently appointed a technical advisor who emphasized the strategic value of this approach.

As President and CEO Merlin Marr-Johnson stated their management:

""I am also delighted that Fitzroy management has outlined a fast-track route to non-operated copper production at Buen Retiro, which could give the Company sufficient cash flow to self-fund exploration in future years.""

The company holds approximately C$11M in cash supporting an ~C$8M exploration budget. The oxide project spans over 1.4 km of continuous copper mineralization with predominantly leachable minerals enabling low-cost heap leach processing. Brownfields status provides permitting advantages, while nearby hydrometallurgical infrastructure offers potential toll-processing solutions reducing capital intensity. Preliminary Economic Assessment is underway.

The sulphide project targets a large-scale copper-molybdenum-gold-rhenium porphyry system with initial drilling confirming 200 metres at 0.46% copper with higher-grade sub-zones. Multiple kilometre-long geophysical and geochemical anomalies across the 18,000 hectare land package suggest substantial exploration upside. By-product metals including rhenium, a scarce element used in superalloys, could materially enhance project economics. Strategic positioning between two major producing districts in a region with established infrastructure provides development advantages.

Rome Resources advances high-grade tin-copper-zinc-silver discoveries in the Democratic Republic of Congo's eastern region, located 8 km from one of the world's highest-grade producing tin mines. The company recently announced a £200,000 placement to fund additional drilling related to ongoing tin discoveries, highlighting continued support for exploration of critical minerals in a district with demonstrated world-class grades.

The asset portfolio centers on two prospects: a tin-copper-zinc-silver system at Mont Agoma and a high-grade tin-only system at Kalayi. Over 5,000 metres across 26 holes have been drilled by mid-2025 with first resource models initiated for both targets. Mont Agoma hosts polymetallic mineralization with geochemical and drill data indicating large undrilled deeper zones representing expansion potential, while Kalayi features high-grade plunging tin shoots across a 2-km-long soil anomaly.

Tin's supply-demand fundamentals support the exploration thesis, with the metal identified as highly leveraged to electrification through solar panel manufacturing, electronics, and specialized battery applications. Global tin demand is forecast to grow up to 40% by 2030 driven by technology adoption. Rome operates three drill rigs with on-site core logging and XRF facilities, plus approximately 1,000 kg of metallurgical samples shipped for beneficiation testwork to understand multi-metal recovery potential. With continued drilling momentum and resource modeling underway, Rome represents early-stage exposure to high-grade tin discovery in a district with demonstrated production history.

The Investment Thesis for Battery Metals

Supply chain security premiums favor projects in Canada, Australia, and stable jurisdictions over lower-cost but geopolitically risky alternatives. Western automakers and governments increasingly prioritize supply reliability and ESG credentials over marginal cost advantages, supporting valuation premiums for Tier-1 assets even with higher operating costs.

Battery metal developments advancing with automaker offtake agreements, government loan guarantees, or critical minerals program participation demonstrate external validation and reduced financing risk. Projects lacking strategic alignment face higher hurdles securing project finance and may trade at discounts despite strong technical fundamentals.

Nickel, lithium, graphite, copper, and tin each face distinct supply-demand dynamics and price cycles. Portfolio allocation across multiple commodities provides downside protection when individual metals experience corrections while maintaining upside exposure to electrification's broad-based critical mineral demand.

Advanced-stage projects with completed feasibility studies and near-term construction decisions offer less execution risk but potentially lower return multiples, while earlier-stage exploration and resource definition plays provide higher risk-adjusted returns for patient capital willing to accept development timeline uncertainty and permitting risk.

As automakers face increasing pressure to reduce Scope 3 emissions across supply chains, battery metals produced with renewable energy and carbon sequestration capabilities command premiums. Projects demonstrating low-carbon production pathways gain competitive advantages in customer qualification processes beyond pure cost competitiveness.

Given China's dominance in processing and its significant role in mining certain battery metals, policy shifts around production quotas, export restrictions, or environmental enforcement can rapidly tighten supply and drive price movements. Regulatory developments in Indonesia for nickel and China's domestic lithium market interventions create asymmetric risk-reward scenarios.

The battery metals investment case rests on secular electrification trends creating durable demand growth across nickel, lithium, graphite, copper, and tin, while supply responses remain constrained by permitting timelines, capital intensity, and geopolitical concentration. This supply-demand imbalance, amplified by Western governments' strategic prioritization of supply chain security, creates a favorable multi-year environment for projects in stable jurisdictions even if near-term prices experience volatility. Policy support through tax credits, loan guarantees, and domestic content requirements materially de-risks project financing for advanced-stage assets aligned with government critical minerals strategies.

Investor approaches should emphasize jurisdictional quality and strategic positioning over pure resource metrics. Projects in Canada, Australia, and other Tier-1 jurisdictions benefit from nearshoring premiums as automakers prioritize supply security, while developments with automaker partnerships or government backing demonstrate external validation reducing execution risk. Portfolio construction across multiple battery metals provides diversification, as individual commodities experience distinct price cycles. Lithium's recent volatility contrasts with nickel's structural deficit and graphite's processing bottlenecks, suggesting uncorrelated return profiles.

The four case study companies exemplify different risk-reward profiles within battery metals: Canada Nickel offers large-scale nickel sulphide development with zero-carbon differentiation and district growth potential; Sovereign Metals provides unique rutile-graphite by-product economics with near-term DFS completion; Fitzroy Minerals balances near-term oxide cash flow against sulphide exploration upside in established copper districts; and Rome Resources represents early-stage high-grade tin discovery with resource growth potential but elevated jurisdictional and exploration risk. For investors seeking exposure to the energy transition through tangible supply-demand fundamentals and reduced geopolitical vulnerability, battery metals in quality jurisdictions present compelling opportunities as electrification transitions from policy aspiration to physical infrastructure reality.

TL;DR

Battery metals present compelling investment opportunities as electric vehicle adoption and energy storage drive structural demand growth across nickel, lithium, graphite, and copper. Supply constraints persist from geopolitical concentration with Indonesia controlling over 50% of nickel and China dominating graphite processing, while Western governments prioritize supply chain diversification through reshoring incentives. Canada Nickel advances zero-carbon nickel production with district-scale potential, Sovereign Metals offers unique rutile-graphite by-product economics, Fitzroy Minerals balances copper oxide development with sulphide exploration in Chile, and Rome Resources pursues high-grade tin discovery in the DRC. Projects in Tier-1 jurisdictions with strategic partnerships command premiums as automakers secure long-term supply, creating favorable outlook for quality battery metal assets despite price volatility.

Improving system reliability by fully anticipating how renewables and DERs affect the whole power system.
PlanOS also enables scenario-based planning, giving utilities the ability to explore multiple potential futures and stress-test investments under different load growth, policy, and technology conditions.","For a decade and a half, the U.S. Energy Information Administration’s (EIA) forecast of electricity consumption was predictable — and predictably flat. Indeed, between 2005 and 2020 load growth averaged about 0.1%, pushed slightly upward by population and economic growth while also held down by improved efficiency.

The rest of the world has also seen relatively modest growth in electricity demand. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), global electricity demand grew by an average of 2.6% between 2015 and 2023.

Today, however, we have entered the era of load growth, which is witnessing a generational shift on how energy is generated, transmitted and consumed. The demand as it used to be, in terms of predictability and density, has transformed itself into patterns that are complex to predict and extremely high density, thanks to greater demand from electric transportation, manufacturing and, of course, the boom in electricity-thirsty data centers. The U.S. Department of Energy has forecasted that data centers could consume as much as 580 TWh annually in 2028, equal to about 123 GW and representing up to 12% of total US electricity consumption. Across the globe, electricity demand is forecasted to rise by 3.3% in 2025 and 3.7% in 2026 – with China and India growing significantly faster.

Reliable supplies of increasing amounts of electricity are an economic and societal imperative, which is why utilities are making historic investments in grid infrastructure and assets. According to the International Energy Agency’s 2025 World Energy Investment report, capital investment in the energy sector is set to rise by $3.3 trillion, a 2% increase from 2024. $2.2 trillion of that investment includes funds earmarked for grid optimization.

The German utility E.ON announced plans to invest 34 billion Euros on grid infrastructure between 2024 and 2028. The Indian government says the country needs to invest over $500 billion USD by 2032 to provide the power the growing country requires. The ASEAN Infrastructure Fund has committed over $500 million and disbursed more than $460 million to 15 projects across six ASEAN countries. The fund provides loans to finance infrastructure investment projects such as renewable energy plants and transmission and power grid development.

But the challenge remains: Not all investments are created equal in terms of ensuring the reliability of a grid buffeted by rapidly growing demand, extreme weather, a proliferation of distributed energy resources (DERs), and aging equipment. Utilities, regulators, grid operators, and developers all need to direct their investments efficiently and effectively, simultaneously meeting demand while also improving reliability and containing costs.

The integrated system planning imperative

Put simply, utility planners are faced with a challenging task. Making their task even more daunting is the reality that the tools and processes planners have long relied on were built for a very different power system than we have now. Transmission, distribution and generation planners have traditionally worked to manage and orchestrate a centralized generation with unidirectional flows of electricity. Planning departments have traditionally been structured vertically, creating divides between functions that solve for economics, physics and system adequacy.

When load growth was modest and electricity flowed in one direction from large power plants to consumers, that approach worked well. But in today’s high load growth environment, where a larger share of renewable generation and distributed energy resources (DERs) are being integrated and extreme weather threatens system reliability, a more holistic approach to planning is critical. When different planning teams use their own complicated models with various tools and data, working together becomes difficult and time-consuming. Today’s grid planning needs to bring these different approaches together to make the process faster, more accurate, more adaptable, and more collaborative.

Integrated system planning (ISP) acknowledges the pressures of load growth and the complexity and interdependencies of the quickly evolving power system and provides a pathway for the collaboration and coordination needed in planning today. It serves as the backbone for maintaining system adequacy by implementing comprehensive planning for the future grid and delivering a path for a reliable, sustainable and affordable power system.

The value of ISP:

Comprehensive analysis for making faster planning decisions that drive investment signals, operational efficiency, and stakeholder collaboration.

Maximizing the efficiency of investments that drive prioritization while accounting for rapidly changing demand and interconnection requests.

Improving system reliability by fully anticipating how renewables and DERs affect the whole power system.

Accelerating planning cycles to better meet the needs of customers who require electricity as fast as possible.

Improving regulatory outcomes by providing transparency around the need for capital investments.

Powering ISP with PlanOS

ISP requires more than a desire for traditionally siloed planning operations to work together. It demands actual tools to enable seamless, efficient, and valuable collaboration.

GE Vernova’s PlanOS was built to provide a platform that unifies planning data and models capacity expansion, resource adequacy, production cost, and power flow analysis. Instead of running these vital planning studies separately and hoping to reconcile results later, PlanOS integrates them in real time. The result: insights from one planning domain immediately inform others, improving speed and reducing the potential for errors.

A unified data model is the foundation of the PlanOS platform, ensuring all planners work from the same assumptions. Updates flow across the system, eliminating the time-consuming and error-prone process of manually reconciling disparate spreadsheets and models.

PlanOS also enables scenario-based planning, giving utilities the ability to explore multiple potential futures and stress-test investments under different load growth, policy, and technology conditions. Collaboration features like version control and distributed access enable diverse teams to work together seamlessly without losing the specialized tools they need.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/x8jR5LJi2JNqDZNfz53ufHGUi8eo5xofSBDKt6nPOXw/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0xMjk5OTQ3ODQzLmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-12-01 08:01:20.101270
,Indiana American Energy ,2025-12-01 10:13:36+00:00,Utility Dive,Rethinking reliability: Why IBRs need independent verification | Utility Dive,Jonathan Susser,,,,,https://www.utilitydive.com/spons/rethinking-reliability-why-ibrs-need-independent-verification/806196/,"That’s where third-party verification comes in.
Asking project developers or transmission operators to provide their own oversight is problematic: conflicting motivations and incentives, a lack of resources and unspecialized expertise.
In our ideal world for highest grid reliability, every IBR site receives third-party verification To put it bluntly, we can’t currently rely on our IBR facilities to the degree that we need.
That’s why we feel so strongly that independent verification is necessary for us all to truly be confident in the reliability, safety and performance of IBRs.
Just like a home inspection puts buyers at ease, third-party verification can do the same for grid operators, providing assurance that the resources they’re integrating will perform as predicted.","We rely on the objectivity and trustworthiness of third parties to stay informed and make better decisions throughout our lives. Before purchasing a house, home inspectors help us identify issues we may overlook. In business, external auditors assess financial statements for accuracy and compliance.

But at a time of rapidly rising demand for electricity and other threats to the reliable supply of power, inverter-based resources (IBRs) are interconnecting to the grid without any comparable level of evaluation — without confirmation that they align with their interconnection agreements and without assurance that the models used by transmission operators reflect what’s on the ground.

And when models don’t reflect what’s on the ground, and when what’s on the ground doesn’t conform to requirements, the consequences can be severe. That’s where third-party verification comes in.

But how did we get here?

Getting IBRs online requires a different approach than we’re used to

Synchronous sources of generation — the backbone of our grid for more than a century — have traditionally been built and maintained by the entities also responsible for ensuring the reliability of the bulk power system: utilities.

With IBRs, those responsibilities are more commonly dispersed, with project developers and generator owners building facilities with an emphasis on cost and speed, and transmission operators tasked with maintaining grid stability.

Not only that, but IBRs, as a technology, differ significantly from synchronous generation. They’re based on software that controls the instantaneous output of power electronics, with no spinning inertial mass to provide a guaranteed stability buffer during times of regional grid instability. Inverters can provide excellent grid stability support, too — but only when their hundreds of adjustable functions and parameters are correctly set.

This new landscape calls for new strategies for keeping the grid running as smoothly and dependably as we’ve come to expect in the U.S.

A lack of verification can have real consequences

Although grid operators may have interconnection agreements based on industry standards and guidelines, such as IEEE 2800, without verification that those standards and guidelines are actually being followed, we can’t be confident that they’re doing any good.

Through the North American Electric Reliability Corporation’s (NERC’s) disturbance reports and alerts on reliability risks, we know that IBR plants are often configured incorrectly, putting the grid at risk due to unexpected and unnecessary tripping events — like what happened in Odessa in 2021 and 2022 and in the Iberian Peninsula earlier this year.

We’ve witnessed as much in our own on-site inspections of 300+ distribution- and transmission-connected IBRs. We continue to find inverters programmed with protection-related settings that deviate from known requirements and power plant controller (PPC) settings misaligned with the facility’s voltage schedule requirements specified by the transmission operator.

In fact, nearly every site we’ve visited since our work in this space began in 2017 has had deficiencies and discrepancies that have needed addressing.

Third-party verification is the solution the industry needs right now

Having a third party commission and verify IBRs — review site documentation and installed inverter settings, conduct PPC demonstrations, update and reconcile facility models — bridges the gap between transmission and generator operators.

Ultimately, it’s quality assurance that reveals whether facilities comply with the appropriate standards and agreements and whether grid operators can trust that their sites will perform as expected.

Asking project developers or transmission operators to provide their own oversight is problematic: conflicting motivations and incentives, a lack of resources and unspecialized expertise. A neutral third party can develop the proficiency necessary to confront the unique complexity of IBRs.

In our ideal world for highest grid reliability, every IBR site receives third-party verification

To put it bluntly, we can’t currently rely on our IBR facilities to the degree that we need. That may not be apparent in monthly performance reports; it may only show up during major events. But those are what we’re trying to avoid.

Unfortunately, the compliance issues that we and others are finding are unlikely to resolve themselves, and that will only elevate risk as IBR penetration — and load growth from data centers, manufacturing and electrification — increases.

That’s why we feel so strongly that independent verification is necessary for us all to truly be confident in the reliability, safety and performance of IBRs. Even starting small, initiating a pilot program or updating documentation requirements, can make a big difference.

Just like a home inspection puts buyers at ease, third-party verification can do the same for grid operators, providing assurance that the resources they’re integrating will perform as predicted. It’s a smart investment in the future of our power system.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/IAeJb4vCx-DuczRLtIsiG-B7oKlvIQ3zLNxc8Y8a7eQ/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9BRV9IZWFkZXJfSW1hZ2UucG5n.webp,N,,2025-12-01 08:01:24.613564

""So I don't think that's going to be good for any of our energy bills.""","Data centers are fueling a race to develop artificial intelligence tools that have the potential to revolutionize almost every sector of society, and Big Tech is receiving bipartisan support at nearly every level of government to aid in this global competition for AI dominance.

But these building projects that have become a unifying force for politicians are also galvanizing communities that object to seeing one of these behemoth campuses of computer servers pop up in their backyards.

RELATED: Pa. and N.J. want data centers to guarantee their own power supply

Last month in Plymouth Township, the zoning board held a public hearing to discuss a proposal to build a 2 million square-foot data center at 900 Conshohocken Road, transforming 10 buildings at the former Cleveland-Cliffs steel mill that sits on 66 acres of land along the Schuylkill River into a high-tech network.

When Montgomery County residents learned about the plan to build this facility near their homes, they began fighting back – citing concerns over the project's potential impacts on the environment and their energy bills.

""This is like a David versus Goliath fight, and we're trying to get everyone mobilized and understand this,"" Patti Smith, who organized a petition that received over 1,000 signatures, said before the hearing.

Then on Nov. 18, residents packed the room to voice their opinions at the zoning hearing, only to find out that the developer had to withdraw the application over a legal issue because the agreement of sale of the property was not finalized. While this appears to be a victory for the community activists, they anticipate the developer will refile the application and are concerned this move only allows more time for an ordinance to be drafted that would give the company a stronger legal standing when the proposal is revisited.

In neighboring Chester County, another data center that's being proposed at the former Pennhurst State School and Hospital site is also receiving strong opposition from the community, with a petition that's racked up over 12,000 signatures. That proposal could also stall as opposition is pushing for an ordinance to tighten regulations.

While these neighbors are standing up against Big Tech, they are also realizing they're confronting resource-rich developers and a government that in many ways is working to ease restrictions as the country tries to meet the insatiable energy demands created by the growing use of AI platforms like ChatGPT.

In June, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro (D) announced that Amazon will spend at least $20 billion to develop cloud computing and AI innovation campuses in the state. The investment, which the company says will create at least 1,250 tech jobs, will start by building facilities in Falls Township in Bucks County and Salem Township in Luzerne County before exploring other communities for future sites.

Shortly after that investment was touted by state officials, President Donald Trump signed an executive order to accelerate federal permitting of data center development.

Then last month, governors from Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland and Virginia (three Democrats and one Republican) submitted a joint proposal that would fast-track approvals for data center projects in which developers agree to build energy lines or substations and generate at least enough electricity to offset how much power the facility is expected use.

""Everybody wants to be the biggest and best adopter of AI technology and make the most money for their state, but it's very short-sighted,"" said Genevieve Boland, one of the organizers of the Cleveland-Cliffs petition. ""So the direction is coming from the federal government to essentially expedite data center approvals everywhere across the country and that has been trickled down to the state. Shapiro made a deal with Amazon and that was a huge deal. And then his mandate has trickled down to regional and local zoning boards to do whatever to approve these data centers.""

Impact on electric bills

While the AI boom is putting pressure on existing electricity grids and causing a nearly unquenchable thirst for more energy resources, it remains to be seen how these demands will affect the bills of residential customers.

The U.S. Department of Energy reported last year that data centers consumed about 4.4% of the total U.S. electricity in 2023, and it predicts that will rise to 12% by 2028.

And the increase in the number of these facilities has coincided with a rise in costs. In Pennsylvania, the average electric bill has gone from $134.85 in 2022 to $160.57 this year, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

But data centers might not be completely to blame for the higher bills, said Geoffrey Blanford, a principal technical executive at the Electric Power Research Institute, an independent nonprofit that does research for the nation's electric power industry.

""Most of the increase has been related to economy-wide inflation trends,"" he said. ""Where it's been faster than inflation has been in places like California, which had a really steep increase that's mostly related to wildfire impacts. ... Other places like New England, you've also seen higher prices. But again, that's more around (transmission and distribution) costs, grid modernization and resilience more so than data centers. So there are a lot of factors. Data centers are potentially one of them but really has not been the main one for what we've seen recently.""

Researchers at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory found that the average retail price of electricity in Pennsylvania over the past six years has risen 7.4% faster than inflation, the New York Times reported. In New Jersey, it's up 6.1%. But it's actually down in other parts of the country — including much of the Southeast, Midwest and Mountain regions.

In addition to the quantity of data centers, the speed at which they are being built is also causing a power problem. Despite their size, these massive campuses can be built within a year or two in many cases. And the projects often require investments to improve the local grid, like adding new sources to generate energy or enhancing existing systems.

""They can be built pretty quickly, which means it puts a lot of pressure on the timeline for adding grid resources, which tend to be a little bit slower than how fast you can add a data center,"" Blanford said. ""So it's been a major issue for power system planning.""

Tech companies have now become both energy consumers and producers, and whether individuals and small businesses see a jump in their bills might be dependent on state regulators and lawmakers making sure those firms cover the expenses.

""In theory, there are potential benefits to the electric system from having a large load there,"" Blanford said. ""... It can help with reliability, and it's not necessarily something to take for granted that it's going to increase electricity prices. In fact, it could decrease electricity prices by having more energy to spread the fixed costs over.""

Another factor that could impact utility bills is the Trump administration's stand against renewable energy projects, said Sorelle Friedler, a professor of computer science at Haverford College who served as the assistant director for data and democracy under the Biden administration. The Interior Department's policies are causing permitting delays and the agency has been reviewing previously approved wind and solar farms.

""So we're actually, as a society right now, reducing the amount of energy that we could be generating while increasing the usage of it,"" Friedler said. ""So I don't think that's going to be good for any of our energy bills.""

To try to protect consumers, some politicians are stepping in. In New Jersey, Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill campaigned on halting rising utility costs, promising to freeze rates and declare a ""state of emergency on utility costs"" on her first day in office.

""My priority is relief to New Jersey consumers, and I will bring everyone to the table to deliver it,"" she said in a statement.

Environmental impact

The AI boom is only a few years old so grasping the environmental impact can be challenging, but a study by Cornell University researchers published last month in the journal Nature Sustainability set out to quantify the industry's ecological footprint – and their estimations are staggering.

Depending on the speed of AI growth, researchers said U.S. data centers could eventually consume as much as 10 million Americans and emit as much carbon dioxide as 10 million cars per year, which would be equivalent of the annual resource consumption of the entire state of New York.

The Cleveland-Cliffs project in Plymouth Township calls for electricity generated by use natural gas turbines, which is cleaner than burning coal but still emits pollutants such as nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxides, formaldehyde and benzene. The Environmental Protection Agency warns that exposure to these types of emissions can have serious health effects, even though power plants have made great strides in reducing them over the past couple decades.

""As soon as we heard natural gas turbines ... we became incredibly alarmed,"" said Smith, the organizer of the petition against the project. ""... My preferred exposure to formaldehyde is honestly zero per year.""

The cooling system needed to prevent servers from overheating also has an environmental impact. Google said in 2021 that its average data center consumed around 450,000 gallons of water per day, which it said was the ""same amount of water used to irrigate 17 acres of turf lawn grass once.""

In their study, the Cornell scientists recommend holding tech companies to similar standards put on vehicle manufacturers to mandate fuel efficiency – with tighter regulations, more transparency and benchmarks for energy usage.",https://media.phillyvoice.com/media/images/USATSI_27527015.2e16d0ba.fill-1200x630-c0.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 09:01:22.284153

ENCK: Climate change has been front and center for a long time, and it is an overwhelming problem.","Judith Enck has spent her entire career working to protect public health and the environment.

Enck took the helm of New York’s oldest environmental organization, Environmental Advocates NY, soon after graduating college, then went on to hold senior leadership roles in state and federal government, including as deputy secretary for the environment in the New York Governor’s Office and a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency regional administrator during Barack Obama’s two terms. Now, as a professor at Bennington College and president of the Vermont-based nonprofit Beyond Plastics, Enck is on a mission to “end plastic pollution everywhere.”

Toward that end, Enck, who describes herself as a “solid waste gal,” wrote a new book with journalist Adam Mahoney called “The Problem With Plastic.”

The main problem with plastic, the authors say, is that it’s ubiquitous, polluting the planet, driving climate change and making us sick.

Plastic production has increased exponentially, from about 2 million tons a year in 1950 to 450 million tons a year today, with no limit in sight. And because plastics are made from fossil fuels and thousands of toxic chemicals derived from oil and gas, they cause harm throughout their life cycle, from extraction of the fossil fuels they’re made of to their production, use and disposal. Low-income communities and people of color who live near plastic plants bear the brunt of the industry’s toxic emissions, Enck and Mahoney say. Yet we all inhale and consume hundreds of thousands of microplastics per year.

Plastics have become so pervasive that scientists have found them blowing in the wind, near the peak of Mt. Everest, in the snow of Antarctica, in the ocean’s deepest trenches, in placentas, breast milk, stool, blood, lungs and even in our brains.

Plastic was never designed to be recycled, Enck explains in the book. The only aspect of plastics actually being recycled is the myth that recycling will stop plastic pollution. Inside Climate News recently spoke with Enck about the extent of the plastic crisis, its role in the climate crisis and what it will take to move beyond plastic. This conversation has been edited for clarity and length.

LIZA GROSS: Was there a specific moment or event that made you decide that plastic pollution was the issue you wanted to devote your time and energy to?

JUDITH ENCK: Well, there are two moments. One is the moment I was born. My parents, the late Helen and Sonny Enck, named me after St. Jude, the patron saint of lost causes. But I don’t believe plastics is a lost cause. I just think it’s an uphill battle.

But seriously, I do remember a moment, though it’s not like I wasn’t following the issue.

I was sitting at my desk at EPA Region 2 in lower Manhattan, and I read an article about the massive amount of plastic loading into the ocean, and it stopped me in my tracks. I know how important the ocean is, a major source of protein for most of the world. And I read that about 80 percent of plastic in the ocean comes from the land. It’s roadside litter that goes down a storm drain, into a stream, into a river, into the ocean. Or it’s derelict fishing gear. And it is really damaging the ocean.

And I decided at that moment, when I left the EPA, I was going to work on plastics. I didn’t know how, I didn’t know where, but that’s what led to the launching of Beyond Plastics, and then eventually the writing of this book.

GROSS: People often talk about plastics breaking down, but I’ve heard you say that’s not the right way to think about it. Could you expand on that?

ENCK: Plastics are made from fossil fuels and chemicals, and they are not degradable. So they don’t break down, they become smaller pieces of plastic. And in many ways, those smaller pieces are a much greater risk. So five millimeters or less is a microplastic, the size of a grain of salt. And then even smaller than that is a nanoplastic, and that’s what we’re breathing in and swallowing and, and that’s what’s building up from the Himalayan Mountains to the bottom of the Mariana Trench and everything in between.

GROSS: One thing that people might be surprised to learn is that plastic recycling was actually a PR strategy. In the book, you say that’s been part of a strategy to shift responsibility from the producer onto the individual consumer, to obscure the fact that companies are producing huge volumes of materials that can’t be recycled. How did that strategy become so effective?

ENCK: Because we were all subjected to a multimillion-dollar advertising campaign by plastic companies deceiving us into thinking we can recycle most of our plastic, which just isn’t true. You can recycle an old aluminum can into a new can, newspaper into cardboard or other paper products. But with plastics, we’ve got 16,000 different chemicals, many different colors, many different plastic types, or polymers. Think of your own home. You may have a bright orange plastic soap detergent near your washing machine and a black plastic takeout container in your refrigerator and a plastic bag on your counter. None of them can be recycled together. You have to separate everything by color, by chemical and by polymer. The people who know this the best there are plastic manufacturers, and yet they chose to spend millions of dollars telling us, don’t worry about all of your single-use plastic packaging, for instance, just put it in your recycling bin. But it really messes up recycling programs.

So I want to be clear: People should keep recycling paper, cardboard, metal and glass, and compost your yard waste and your food waste. But plastic recycling has been an abysmal failure.

GROSS: I was surprised to learn that the industry intentionally created confusion around recycling symbols, conflating the chasing arrows symbol that indicates products were made out of recycled materials with the numbers used to indicate things that can be recycled. It’s amazing how those very simple symbols could be such a powerful tool of misinformation.

ENCK: Yes. On one hand, it’s great that people look for the symbol because they want to do their part. But it is a huge problem when it’s used deceptively. The [Federal Trade Commission] has a voluntary guide that tells you when you can and cannot say that something is recyclable and when you should and shouldn’t use the symbol. But it’s voluntary, so most of the companies ignore that.

And you know, when pressed, I do say keep recycling number one and number two plastic. You have a little bit of a fighting chance that they will get recycled. Most of the other plastic either gets littered in the environment or goes to landfills or to incinerators. And what’s really troubling is, unless plastic is burned at a garbage incinerator, which is fraught with air pollution and other pollution problems, every single piece of plastic ever created is still on the earth today.

GROSS: Even if we were able to recycle things, with all the chemicals that are in these plastics, wouldn’t recycling just be concentrating the chemicals? Do we need to worry about that with the items that actually can be recycled, the ones and twos, as well?

ENCK: A lot of these 16,000 chemicals are very toxic. We’re talking about PFAS chemicals, lead, mercury, cadmium, vinyl chloride, things that should not be touching our food. Beyond Plastics does not believe that recycled plastic should be used in any food packaging. We don’t want food or beverage packaging made from recycled plastic.

We’ve looked a little bit at the Food and Drug Administration process for companies to get approval to use recycled plastic in their consumer products. And the nicest thing I can say about it is it’s a very flimsy process itself. It’s self-reporting, and the FDA seems to have a giant rubber stamp out. They’re not looking out for our health and our well-being when they allow recycled-content plastic for food packaging.

GROSS: Speaking of all these toxic chemicals in plastics, scientists have been linking plastics increasingly to all sorts of non-communicable diseases. What are they learning about potential mechanisms of harm in what seems to be a relatively new yet ballooning research field?

ENCK: It is new, which is why the cuts in federal funding for public health research is so concerning. The first really comprehensive study I looked at was the presence of microplastics in the human placenta, which was done by Dr. Ragusa in Rome with some other Italian scientists. The baby is only in utero for seven, eight, nine months and is already being born pre-polluted, and there’s also microplastics in breast milk.

Microplastics have been found in virtually every part of the human body that scientists have looked at. We either inhale them or we swallow them, and microplastics have been found in our blood, our kidneys, our lungs, male testicles.

I think two of the most significant studies are one that was published by New England Journal of Medicine, looking at microplastics in the heart arteries, and they looked at plaque, and found if you had microplastics on the plaque, which many of the patients did, you had an increased risk of heart attack, stroke and premature death. And then another recent study looking at microplastics in the brain unfortunately documented that the microplastics, nanoplastics, cross the blood-brain barrier and increase risk of Alzheimer’s and other neurological diseases.

And recently there have been a couple articles about people asking, can you get it out of your body? It’s not like lead and chelation. You know, there’s no easy way to get this out of your body. So let’s redouble our efforts to prevent it from going into our bodies.

GROSS: What is the best way for people to keep this stuff out of our bodies?

ENCK: You can’t shop your way out of this problem. There are some steps you can take. The book has a section for people to do a home audit. Look at your kitchen. Get rid of that plastic cutting board. Do not put plastic in the microwave. Only buy cotton bed sheets because you’re spending, on a good day, seven hours in bed, so make sure your sheets and blankets are not made of plastic.

I know a lot of people who tell me the great lengths they go to avoid plastic, and if I’m close friends with them, I say, “That’s really good—could you spend half of that time calling your legislator and writing a letter to the editor?” We have to get systemic change. We have to mainstream alternatives to plastics.

Now here’s the good news: A lot of the alternatives are already here. Give me old-fashioned paper, cardboard, metal, glass, because it can be made from recycled material, and actually does get recycled. But I want to emphasize, by far the most important thing is reduction, reuse and refill. Building that refill-reuse infrastructure is crucial.

GROSS: There’s a lot of talk about stopping plastic pollution at its source. So just cap the production. More than 100 countries during the recent U.N. plastics treaty talks pushed for that to no avail. What do you think some of the most promising strategies are to really get a handle on this crisis?

ENCK: I think the action is at the state and local level. There are a lot of people—and we wrote the book for these very people who want to do something about the plastic crisis—and they can show up at their city council and say, “Let’s ban plastic bags.” They can show up at their county legislature and say, “Let’s provide funding to Meals on Wheels and restaurants to install dishwashing equipment so we’re not all eating our delicious food off of, you know, polystyrene plastic plates and forks.”

The way we’re going to win is with probably 1,000 different strategies, with tens of thousands of different people in the lead. This issue really calls out for local action.

And then you climb the ladder. In New York, for instance, New York City banned plastic bags, and then the state did. That one little thing of banning all plastic bags at retail stores has been immense, and it’s just one of many things that can happen.

“The way we’re going to win is with probably 1,000 different strategies, with tens of thousands of different people in the lead. This issue really calls out for local action.”

GROSS: There was a pretty striking stat in the book about plastic production emitting four times more greenhouse gases than the global aviation industry, which we think of as a massive contributor to the climate crisis. Why do you think the connection between climate and plastic is still unappreciated?

ENCK: Climate change has been front and center for a long time, and it is an overwhelming problem. Then you layer on plastics as a climate issue—it’s just a lot. But it’s actually not hard to document. Back in 2001 I wanted to figure out, because no one else had done it, what are the greenhouse gas emissions over the plastic life cycle?

We commissioned a report to look at greenhouse gas emissions from production, use and disposal, and what we found was pretty disturbing. We found that 232 million tons of greenhouse gases were emitted every year. That’s the equivalent of 116 coal-fired power plants. So we did this report, The New Coal: Plastics and Climate Change.

Beyond Plastics and the Center for International Environmental Law both identified plastics as a major climate issue. I just think the climate crisis is overwhelming, and people think about power production and transportation.

Now here’s the great irony: fossil fuel companies know they’re losing market share for transportation and power production. So their plan B is plastic production. The largest plastic producer in the U.S. today is ExxonMobil.

GROSS: You dedicated the book to the low-income communities of color living in the shadow of plastics facilities in the Gulf Coast and beyond. Are there any stories you heard from people living near these plants that really stuck with you?

ECNK: I was in Port Arthur, Texas, a couple years ago, and looking at this enormous petrochemical buildout, with local residents dependent upon the jobs, dependent upon this industry to keep Port Arthur alive, and yet Port Arthur is not doing well. I toured the Houston Ship Channel with a representative from Houston Air Alliance, and saw how close people’s homes are to these facilities. Same thing in Cancer Alley in Louisiana.

Our government has allowed the creation of sacrifice zones, and that is unethical. If people had resources, a lot of them would move. But they don’t have financial resources, nor should they move. These are their ancestral homes.

You hear Jo and Joy Banner with the Descendants Project talking about how we went from plantations to chemical plants. The through line is racism. So it means a lot to have, for instance, Dr. Robert Bullard endorse the book and the others, mostly women, happy to be profiled. They’re just doing extraordinary work, facing enormous odds, but they’re also winning.

Gross: Is there a final hopeful message you’d like to share?

ENCK: We wanted the book to be hopeful, which is hard to do on this issue. But we are hopeful, because while I don’t live in Cancer Alley or the Houston Ship Channel, I can work on policies to reduce the demand for plastics. That’s why we wrote the book. You can’t just leave it to people living in Cancer Alley to solve the problem.",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2226334572-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 09:01:07.471384

Read also: The Role of Sustainable Practices in Modern Supply Chain Management

The pandemic and geopolitical chaos have exposed the fragility of global supply chains, and the old model of chasing the lowest labor rates overseas is no longer viable. When the true costs emerge, delays, lost sales, and bloated inventory, the math favors inventory that is closer to the customer. When a container is delayed or a supplier in Asia is disrupted, empty shelves, stock-outs, and lost sales flood the P&L. Availability and next-day (or near-next-day) fulfilment matter far more to consumers than the country of origin. That shifts the advantage toward production and logistics closer to demand.

The Proof It’s Happening (and Not Just Rhetoric)

US Export-Import Bank Commits $100 Billion to Secure Supply Chains

This resurgence isn’t a talking point — it’s measurable.

Manufacturing and construction are at historic levels. As companies regionalize production, such as chips, batteries, and clean-energy components, spending on U.S. factory construction has surged to unprecedented highs, reaching a $223 billion seasonally adjusted annual rate in July 2025 (up from low double-digit billions less than a decade ago).

Reshoring is driving real employment growth. The nonprofit Reshoring Initiative reports that 244,000 jobs were announced in 2024, tied to reshoring and foreign direct investment, with a cumulative total of ~1.7 million jobs since 2010. Announcements aren’t the same as payrolls, but they do signal capital commitments, vendor build-outs, and logistics reconfiguration.

Companies are publicly committing to significant U.S. investments. For example, Texas Instruments announced plans to invest over $60 billion in U.S. semiconductor manufacturing (in Texas and Utah), creating some 60,000 jobs. Nvidia, TSMC, IBM, and Apple have all followed suit, publicly announcing investments in U.S. manufacturing capacity this year.

Collectively, these indicators point to a re-anchoring of critical production closer to end demand.

The Technology Stack Making “Made in America” Competitive

Ultimately, it’s not enough to bring the factory home. The new path to competitiveness is via digital + proximity. Ten years ago, domestic production was seen as a cost burden. Today, tech is turning it into a competitive advantage:

AI and advanced dispatch replace manual routing, compressing decision cycles from hours to seconds.

Digital twins enable companies to simulate thousands of “what-if” supply-chain scenarios (supplier shifts, demand swings, regional disruptions) before committing capex.

Automation and robotics reduce repetitive labor and human error across inbound, warehouse, and packaging operations.

End-to-end visibility at the SKU or carton level enables leaner inventories without sacrificing control.

Executives are leaning in: Deloitte’s 2025 smart-manufacturing research reveals that manufacturers are intensifying their digital initiatives to navigate complex transformations, mitigate operational risks, and mitigate labor scarcity. Broader Deloitte work finds the vast majority of manufacturers are already implementing advanced digital capabilities beyond pilots.

From Strategy to Execution: A New Playbook for the American Supply Chain

The new manufacturing boom isn’t just about bringing production back; it’s about moving smarter once it’s here. Modern supply chains are increasingly defined by:

Flexible fleets that shift seamlessly between middle-mile, LTL, and final-mile modes.

Dynamic cross-docks and forward deployments that position inventory closer to regional demand.

Software-orchestrated visibility that enables instant reconfiguration when disruptions occur.

Success metrics that matter to customers: on-time delivery, inventory turns, sell-through, cost-to-serve (which now includes dwell, touches and damage).

Here’s what that looks like in practice:

Start at the Customer Edge.Don’t “boil the network.” Begin with the customer promise and work backward. Identify where long lead times or stockouts are breaking the experience, and pilot near-market solutions that close the gap. Modular, tech-enabled cross-docks and forward-deployed inventory enable the repositioning of freight closer to demand, allowing for faster fulfillment without the need for permanent infrastructure.

Use Automation to Offset Labor Costs.The real savings aren’t in cutting labor, they’re in cutting waste. AI-driven routing, dynamic load planning, and real-time dispatch reduce empty miles and idle time across middle-mile and LTL operations. When every mile, pallet, and dock slot is optimized automatically, higher employee wages become a non-issue.

Design for Optionality, Not Rigidity.Volatility is permanent, so optionality must be too. Build networks that can flex between modes – dedicated, pool, LTL, or parcel injections – based on cost, demand, or disruption. Tech-orchestrated nodes and dynamic cross-docks enable you to shorten lanes, diversify port of entry points, and rebalance flows in hours, not weeks.

Choose Partners for Adaptability.Yesterday’s networks were built on legacy partnerships; tomorrow’s are built on APIs. Work with providers who can deliver bespoke solutions in weeks, integrate live data into your TMS, and adjust service levels dynamically. Transparency, automation, and speed of integration are now the true hallmarks of reliability.

Future-Proof Against Policy and Tariff Shocks.Geopolitics won’t stabilize anytime soon. Prepare for tariff or sourcing volatility with digital twins and scenario modeling that simulate the impact of cost, transit time, and service across different configurations. When border rules or input prices change overnight, your network shouldn’t stall; it should re-route itself.

The “American Supply Chain Renaissance” isn’t about waving flags. It’s a pragmatic response to customers who value “in-stock tomorrow” over theoretical landed-cost savings next quarter. Capex is flowing into U.S. factories at record levels; policy is accelerating strategic sectors; digital operations are collapsing time and risk. Companies that align proximity with intelligence and measure success the way customers actually feel it will set the pace in the decade ahead.

Industry Context & Drivers

What factors are driving the resurgence of “Made in America” in supply chains today? It’s simple: speed wins. Consumers don’t care where something is made—they care if it’s in their hands tomorrow. COVID and geopolitical chaos ripped the cover off fragile global supply chains, and the old model of chasing the lowest labor rate overseas doesn’t cut it anymore. When the true costs show up—delays, lost sales, bloated inventory—the math favors being close to the customer. That’s the shift.

How have global disruptions reshaped the cost-benefit analysis of nearshoring or reshoring? For decades, companies optimized for the lowest unit cost. That equation was broken the moment a container stuck offshore meant empty shelves and millions in lost sales. The smarter equation now is reliability times speed, divided by risk. Nearshoring and reshoring aren’t patriotic gestures—they’re risk-adjusted, customer-centric business decisions.

In what ways has technology made domestic manufacturing and logistics more viable compared to five or ten years ago? We’re not relying on nostalgia. We’re relying on new math powered by technology. AI dispatches trucks instantly, robotics strip out warehouse labor, digital visibility lets you run leaner without losing control. Ten years ago, U.S. production looked like a cost drag. Today, tech is what makes it a competitive weapon.

Technology’s Role

Which supply chain technologies are enabling companies to make U.S.-based production competitive? The breakthroughs are in AI, robotics, digital twins, and visibility. AI kills wasted human planning hours. Robotics remove repetitive labor. Digital twins let you test a thousand network scenarios before you spend a dollar. And SKU-level visibility puts you in control of inventory in ways legacy systems never could. This isn’t about keeping up—it’s about leapfrogging.

How are freight networks and logistics infrastructure evolving to support more regionalized supply chains? We’re breaking away from the monolithic mega-DC playbook. The future is modular and on-demand. Flexible fleets, dynamic cross-docks, forward deployments—it’s about configuring networks in real time around customer demand. That’s why we built Warp. Legacy LTL and pool providers are frozen in 1995. Shippers don’t need nostalgia, they need adaptability.

Do you see “Made in America” relying more on digital coordination than physical expansion? Absolutely. You don’t win by pouring concrete; you win by coordinating smarter. We don’t need ten times the warehouses—we need networks that operate like living systems, with software that flexes every asset at peak performance. The future of Made in America is built on digital intelligence, not brute force.

Investor & Policy Perspective

How are government incentives shaping decisions around domestic production and logistics? The CHIPS Act and IRA didn’t just hand out subsidies—they reprogrammed boardroom strategy. If the factory’s in the U.S., the logistics backbone has to be here too. Incentives are accelerants, but the underlying fire is customer demand for faster, more reliable supply chains.

What are investors looking for in logistics and supply chain tech companies tied to the Made in America trend? Investors are done with vanity metrics and “Uber for freight” slides. They’re asking: does your technology actually bend the cost curve and improve service? At Warp, the answer is yes—because we eliminate manual waste in freight networks. That means lower costs, faster delivery, and happier customers. That’s what investors want: defensible tech tied to customer outcomes.

Are U.S.-based logistics startups seeing a funding boost tied to this shift? Yes, but the bar is higher. Spray-and-pray money is dead. What’s left is disciplined capital chasing companies that align with policy, with economics, and with customer reality. If you can prove you’re making Made in America competitive by giving customers faster, cheaper, more reliable freight, there’s money for you.

Actionable Insights for Shippers

What are the first steps shippers should take if they want to rebalance supply chains toward U.S. sourcing or production? Start with the customer experience. Where are you failing them today—stockouts, long lead times, unreliable deliveries? Map those pain points, then rebuild lanes and sourcing strategies around fixing them first. Don’t boil the ocean. Prove it one customer problem at a time.

How can shippers use technology to identify cost savings that offset higher domestic labor costs? Focus on eliminating waste, not labor. Visibility down to the carton, automated routing, smarter packaging, dynamic cross-docks. When you cut out empty miles, extra touches, and bloated safety stock, you offset labor costs overnight. Tech isn’t just a cost saver—it’s a customer experience enhancer.

Which metrics or KPIs should shippers track to evaluate the success of reshoring or nearshoring moves? Measure what your customer feels. On-time pickup and delivery, inventory turns, sell-through rate, cost to serve, damage claims. If your shelves are full, your deliveries are predictable, and your product is moving faster, you’re winning. Anything else is noise.

What kinds of partnerships should shippers prioritize in a Made in America strategy? Only partner with tech-enabled providers who can build around your needs. You don’t need “relationships” and handshakes—you need innovators who can stand up bespoke solutions fast. That’s the difference between another vendor and a true competitive edge.

For companies hesitant about reshoring, what low-risk pilots or partial moves could they test? Pilot with the customer in mind. High-margin SKUs, seasonal launches, or key markets where delivery speed drives loyalty. Or consolidate inbound vendor freight domestically. Start small, but make sure the experiment ties directly to customer outcomes—faster shelves stocked, fewer delays, higher sales.",https://www.globaltrademag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/shutterstock_2635552345-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 05:58:09.741367

“This is a defining moment for politicians of all stripes — what’s your answer to lowering utility bills?
“I told all of them, elect a Democrat, and your bills will go up some more.” Data centers have been a prominent issue in Atlanta’s rural exurbs.","As loyal Republicans, Reece Payton said that he and his family of cattle ranchers in Hogansville, Ga., had one thing on their minds when they cast their ballots in November for the state’s utility board — “to make a statement.”

They were already irked by their escalating electric bills, not to mention an extra $50 a month levied by their local utility to cover a new nuclear power plant more than 200 miles away. But after they heard a data center might be built next to their Logos Ranch, about 60 miles southwest of Atlanta, they had enough of Republicans who seemed far too receptive to the interests of the booming artificial intelligence industry.

“That’s the first time I ever voted Democrat,” Mr. Payton, 58, said.

Message sent.

In some of Georgia’s reddest and most rural counties, Republicans crossed party lines this month and helped propel two Democrats, Peter Hubbard and Alicia Johnson, to landslide upsets, ousting the incumbent candidates on the Georgia Public Service Commission. No Democrat has served on the five-person commission, which regulates utilities and helps set climate and energy policy, since 2007.

Across the country, Democrats have seized on rising anxiety over electricity costs and data centers in what could be a template for the 2026 midterm elections.

In Virginia, Governor-elect Abigail Spanberger pledged during her campaign to lower energy bills and make data centers pay more. In the House of Delegates, one Democratic challenger unseated a Republican incumbent by focusing on curbing the proliferation of data centers in Loudoun County and the exurbs of the nation’s capital.

In New Jersey, Governor-elect Mikie Sherrill promised to declare a state of emergency on utility costs and freeze rates. And in Memphis, State Representative Justin J. Pearson, who is challenging Representative Steve Cohen in a high-profile Democratic primary next year, has vowed to fight a supercomputer by Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence company, xAI, that would be located in a predominantly Black neighborhood.

Strong opposition by citizens forced the Tucson City Council in August to pull the plug on an Amazon data center slated for that Arizona city, and then in September forced Google to call off one in Indianapolis.

“Electricity is the new price of eggs,” said Charles Hua, executive director of Powerlines, a nonpartisan organization which aims to modernize utility regulations and reduce power bills. “This is a defining moment for politicians of all stripes — what’s your answer to lowering utility bills? Because I think consumers and voters are looking for leadership on this.”

After meeting recently with Virginia legislators, Mr. Hua said he was struck by how “the nexus of data centers and utility bills actually came up very consistently.”

In 2022, a spike in natural gas prices following the Russian invasion of Ukraine fueled a rise in energy costs around the U.S. Utilities have also undertaken costly projects to modernize the power grid and improve the infrastructure to guard against extreme weather and absorb an anticipated surge in demand from data centers.

As the price of electricity has risen, more American customers have fallen behind on their utility bills, or have had their power cut off.

Georgia ranks 35th in energy affordability, in part because of cost overruns and delays associated with its new Plant Vogtle nuclear generators in Waynesboro, according to the American Legislative Exchange Council, an influential conservative policy group.

So it wasn’t a surprise when Attorney General Chris Carr and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger — candidates in the Republican primary to succeed term-limited Gov. Brian Kemp — called November’s results a referendum on affordability. “You’re a fool if you don’t recognize that,” Mr. Carr said.

Some Georgia Republicans have cautioned against reading too much into the 25-percentage-point losses suffered by the utility board incumbents, Tim Echols and Fitz Johnson.

This year’s elections stemmed from a 2020 federal lawsuit, which contended that the statewide elections for commission seats, which represent geographic districts, were unfair to Black voters. An appeals court eventually ruled against the plaintiffs, but the legal battle delayed the elections — setting the stage for November’s two races, the only statewide ones this year. (Two more utility seats will be contested in 2026.)

Democratic turnout was also boosted, Republicans said, by municipal elections in strongholds like Atlanta.

“I think it’s a complete anomaly,” State Senator Greg Dolezal said at a Republican event in Valdosta to tout his candidacy for lieutenant governor next year. Noting the comfortable margins racked up by President Trump in 2024 and Mr. Kemp in 2022, he added, “There’s no planet on which a 65-35 split is representative.”

One plaintiff in the lawsuit was Brionté McCorkle, executive director of Georgia Conservation Voters. She said the lawsuit enabled advocacy groups to develop a plan to help people “connect the dots” between the bills they were receiving and the commission’s role in approving six rate increases for Georgia Power, the state’s largest electric provider, over the last two years.

The group’s political action fund spent $2.3 million, sending half a million texts, plastering 92 billboards across the state and producing an anti-incumbent website.

That outreach made a difference, she said, pointing to Lowndes and Brooks counties on the Florida border. In previous races for federal and state offices going back to 2018, including the public service commission, Republicans won there by 20 points.

This year, Mr. Echols and Mr. Johnson each lost by 20 points.

At a weekly food pantry run by South Street Care House in Valdosta, Ga., where dozens of cars had lined up to receive a box full of fresh fruits, vegetables, breads and other staples, several people said they had heard about the election through texts and social media.

Barbara Lehman, 66, is typically a reliable Republican, but not this time, according to her daughter Angela and granddaughter Shelby, who were among those waiting for food.

“If the power companies want to expand their business, then that should be on them, not the consumer,” Ms. Lehman said in a text message. “Some people are just barely making it as it is.”

At the event attended by Mr. Dolezal and two other candidates for statewide offices, Gary McMillan, a former chair of the Lowndes County Republican Party, said that he, too, knew Republicans who bucked the party.

“They said my electric bills keep going up, and Republicans control the public service commission, and I’ve got a problem with that,” Mr. McMillan recounted. “I told all of them, elect a Democrat, and your bills will go up some more.”

Data centers have been a prominent issue in Atlanta’s rural exurbs. Mr. Trump wants to accelerate their growth in the battle for A.I. supremacy. At least 26 are under construction within 60 miles of Atlanta, and another 52 are planned.

But some Georgia Republicans — including Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, who is resigning her seat in January — have questioned the facilities’ use of resources. Some residents say local wells have been damaged, and the cost of municipal water has climbed.

Good Jobs First, a liberal group that tracks tax breaks for corporations, has said the state has done a poor job disclosing subsidies for data centers. The public service commission’s own staff has also warned that monthly residential bills could climb by $20 a month or more (a figure disputed by the utility) if the commission approves Georgia Power’s proposal to add almost 10,000 megawatts of power to accommodate data centers — the equivalent of nine nuclear reactors at Plant Vogtle.

Only one-third of that proposal should be approved, the staff recommended.

In Troup County on the Alabama border, the victorious Democratic utility candidates whittled 24-point romps enjoyed by the Republican candidates in 2020 and 2018 down to 10, thanks to voters like the Paytons.

The Paytons had never been to a Hogansville City Council meeting before they heard about a proposal to build a data center on 437 acres next to their ranch, and across from their Georgia Untamed Zoo, which houses animals like sloths and capybaras and is popular with school field trips. Now they’ve been to two, and counting.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/26/multimedia/00nat-electricity-politics-data-lvpw/00nat-electricity-politics-data-lvpw-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 05:58:17.700375

As a retiree on a fixed income, she is relieved that she’ll likely never have to buy another appliance, her energy bills are lower, and her home feels safer. ​“I don’t have to worry about gas blowing up or carbon monoxide, that kind of nonsense,” she said.

Gay-Robinson is among the hundreds of people who have benefited from a provision of Illinois’ 2021 clean-energy law that allows electric utilities to meet energy-conservation mandates in part by outfitting low-income households with electric appliances that reduce their bills — even though such overhauls actually increase, rather than decrease, electricity use.

Such policies are rare nationwide, but the approach could be a tool to help keep building decarbonization rolling as the Trump administration kills federal incentives for home electrification.

Modern electrical appliances — like induction stoves, electric dryers, and heat pumps that warm and cool spaces — are generally much more energy-efficient than their fossil-fueled counterparts. That means electrifying appliances cuts the amount of fossil fuels burned, even in places where gas and coal plants feed the power grid, said Nick Montoni, senior program director of policy and markets at the North Carolina Clean Energy Technology Center at North Carolina State University. As more renewable energy comes online, the emissions linked to electrical appliances decrease even further.

Plus, families breathe significantly cleaner indoor air when they change to an electric cooktop, due to the slew of health-harming pollutants emitted by gas stoves.

But replacing appliances is not cheap, and under the Trump administration’s budget law, federal tax credits to help households afford electric heat pumps and water heaters expire in December — seven years earlier than they were previously supposed to. Meanwhile, the future is uncertain for the federally funded Home Electrification and Appliance Rebates (HEAR) program, an Inflation Reduction Act initiative that is administered by states and provides incentives for electric appliances. While some states have already launched their HEAR programs, the Trump administration put the remaining funds on ice earlier this year, and Illinois has not yet received its allotment.

Amid this federal upheaval, state policies that incentivize utilities to pick up the tab for electrification can be especially impactful.

“It’s expensive to electrify because it requires up-front cost,” said Montoni, who formerly served as deputy chief of staff at the Department of Energy’s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy. ​“You have to be able to afford a heat pump, an induction stove, an electric water heater — those aren’t inexpensive. That’s why there are rebates and incentives.”

Illinois utilities commit to electrification

Illinois law requires ComEd to cut electricity consumption each year by an amount equivalent to 2% of the utility’s annual sales in the early 2020s. The state’s other big electric utility, Ameren, faces similar rules in 2029 under a law passed this fall, though in the past it had lower savings mandates.

The 2021 Climate and Equitable Jobs Act specifies that a portion of mandated energy savings — 5% since 2022, 10% starting next year, and 15% after 2029 — can come from electrification. The law also created a formula to convert the amount of energy used by a gas-powered appliance to electricity in kilowatt-hours, allowing an estimate of how much energy is saved by switching from gas to electric.

“So if a home gets partially or fully electrified through an electric energy-efficiency program, the utility claims the savings by calculating the difference between the gas therms in kilowatt-hour equivalents and the kilowatt[-hours] added via the electric measures,” explained Kari Ross, Midwest energy affordability advocate for the Natural Resources Defense Council.

Montoni called the policy ​“a pretty interesting mechanism — not unique, but very rare, from what I’ve seen.”

Michigan does have a similar policy, since a 2023 law allows electric and gas utilities to claim electrification as part of their mandatory energy-waste reduction. That legislation also includes a formula for determining the energy-efficiency gains from going electric.

Montoni said allowing electric utilities to count electrification toward their efficiency mandates is an important way to incentivize the shift off fossil fuels, especially in the more than a dozen states where different utilities provide electric and gas service.

When a utility provides both gas and electricity, electrification will typically show overall energy savings, Montoni explained. But when a utility provides only electricity, a formula similar to Illinois’ is needed for the utility to show that it is saving energy, even though a given customer’s electricity use actually increases after electrification.

In northern Illinois, ComEd is the primary electric utility, operating alongside two major gas utilities.

Through its whole-home energy-efficient electrification program, ComEd pays all up-front costs for electric appliances and heat pumps for households earning at or below 80% of the area median income. That initiative has electrified over 700 low-income households since it launched in 2022. The utility also offers rebates for customers of any income for purchasing electric appliances, including geothermal heat pumps.

ComEd’s energy-efficiency plan approved by state regulators says that a quarter of spending on electrification must be for low-income households, and the utility can undertake electrification only if it will save a customer money on their energy bills. Michigan’s law includes a similar provision.

“We carefully model each home to make sure proposed upgrades result in energy savings,” said Philip Roy, ComEd’s director of clean energy solutions. ​“Nationally, I’m pretty sure this is one of the more ambitious approaches to electrification, especially for income-eligible customers.”

Gay-Robinson said she has saved some money on her bills since her home’s overhaul last summer, and more importantly, she has reliable appliances to get through Chicago’s extreme weather.

She recommended the ComEd overhaul to a friend, who was suffering through hot summers in poor health and without air-conditioning. Gay-Robinson thinks the electric heating-cooling system her friend got at no cost may have saved her life.

Gay-Robinson said she still prefers cooking with gas, but she’s grateful ComEd provided new cookware along with her electric induction stove. ​“I thought it would be hard to even work the doggone stove. It looks like something out of the future,” she said. ​“But it wasn’t as hard as I thought.”

More retrofits like Gay-Robinson’s are on the way. In an agreement with stakeholder groups and regulators, ComEd has committed to spend a total of $162.3 million over the next four years on electrification and weatherization, which reduces the amount of power needed to heat and cool spaces.

In central and southern Illinois, Ameren provides both gas and electric service.

Ameren has not undertaken ambitious electrification programs like ComEd, and it had lower energy-efficiency mandates until the clean-energy law passed in October brought its targets into parity with ComEd’s. But Ameren will spend $5 million through 2029 helping customers switch from propane-fired heat, which is common in rural areas, to electric heat pumps.

Changing times

Home-electrification retrofits that lower energy bills may be harder to come by in Illinois and beyond in the future, as electricity prices spike due to the record-high cost of securing enough power-generating capacity for the PJM Interconnection regional grid, which spans 13 states.

Since ComEd is only allowed to offer customers new electrical appliances that will reduce their bills, high electricity prices mean some exchanges that worked in the past will no longer qualify; keeping a gas appliance may be cheaper.

“We are in a moment where further iteration is needed” on electrification policies, said Roy, also citing the impacts of President Donald Trump’s tariffs on appliance costs and the looming expiration of federal tax credits for energy-efficient equipment.

“We see a lot of momentum with these programs,” said Roy. ​“We think [electrification] will play a key role in not just energy-efficiency goals but broader energy policy. Combining all those elements — traditional energy efficiency, electrification, rooftop solar, battery storage — we have a lot of the tools, we just have to fine-tune the policy structures and incentives so we can accelerate the transition.”",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/Water-heater-being-moved_GettyImages-2169894284.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=f619c14dad71f25dfc6335203aeadbc5,N,,2025-12-01 04:58:19.927393

Alternative visions must challenge the financial, trade, and governance frameworks that privilege Global North interests over Global South priorities.","Getting your Trinity Audio player ready...

The global rush toward green hydrogen presents itself as a win-win solution for climate action and economic development. European leaders paint an optimistic picture: South Africa possesses abundant renewable resources, critical minerals for electrolysers, and growing industrial capacity that could position it as a global clean hydrogen leader. South African President Ramaphosa echoes this enthusiasm, envisioning hydrogen as a way to marry Africa’s mineral wealth with renewable energy to decarbonise industries while creating jobs and stimulating investment.

While green hydrogen development is promoted as a climate necessity and force for sustainable development, the inequitable investment partnerships South Africa is making with foreign partners risk reproducing the same extractive relationships where African countries provide raw input while others reap the industrial and financial benefits.

In global trade relations, access to resources and production capacity has rarely translated into control or equitable benefit. Africa’s vast resource potential has historically been externally controlled, with limited domestic value capture. This pattern risks repeating itself in the emerging green hydrogen economy.

South Africa holds a critical role in the emerging hydrogen economy as a source of renewable energy and green hydrogen production. Yet, its position is increasingly shaped by structural and historical dynamics, reducing it to a resource extraction zone, serving the decarbonization and energy security goals of Global North partners.

While European nations secure high-value activities such as technology development, market leadership, financing, trade agreements, and certification schemes within their own borders, South Africa is relegated to low-value roles in production and supply.

Germany’s National Hydrogen Strategy, for example, positions the country as the “lead provider of hydrogen technologies by 2030” (e.g. fuel cell technology), while sourcing hydrogen from partner countries in the Global South. Partner countries are expected to supply raw materials and low-value hydrogen commodities, while Germany retains control over advanced technologies and market access. Similarly, the Netherlands positions itself as Europe’s “hydrogen gateway,” capturing lucrative trading, storage, and transport activities while externalising environmental and social costs to supplier nations.

South Africa’s own Green Hydrogen Commercialisation Strategy, though framed as nationally driven, emphasises export markets. It outlines a vision for over 100 GW of dedicated renewable energy capacity, primarily for export, requiring extensive infrastructure such as desalination plants, specialised transport networks, and dedicated export ports.

This export-first approach risks diverting renewable energy away from urgent domestic priorities like energy access, industrialisation, and job creation, reinforcing green extractivism; the appropriation of land, water, and other resources for renewable energy projects in ways that replicate the exploitative patterns of fossil fuel extraction rather than inclusive development.

Mechanisms of contemporary extraction

Green extractivism operates through sophisticated neoliberal mechanisms that legitimise resource appropriation as a climate necessity. Foreign direct investment and public-private partnerships establish corporate-led governance frameworks that prioritise investor returns over local benefits. Rather than supporting adaptation and mitigation for vulnerable populations, climate finance consolidates corporate control over resource governance and embedding neoliberal policy frameworks within national strategies.

South Africa has restructured its institutions and policies to create an investor-friendly ecosystem, offering tax incentives, subsidies, and tailored regulatory processes to attract foreign investment. The German KfW Development Bank’s allocation of $1.3 billion to support South Africa’s hydrogen sector comes with structural reform conditions mandating increased private sector participation in energy governance. Public funds are channelled through the blended finance platform SA-H2 Fund to de-risk investment in the Coega Green Ammonia project, led by UK-based Hive Energy.

Despite its strategic importance, the project’s value chain remains largely dominated by foreign entities. Its substantial output of one million tonnes of green ammonia annually is geared toward export markets in Asia and Europe. Financial risks are socialised through public funding, while profits are expected to flow primarily to international investors.

South Africa’s profound structural vulnerabilities, shared by many African economies, undermine its position in international energy and trade relationships. Economic fragility, driven by persistent unemployment, extreme inequality, currency depreciation, and Eskom’s debt crisis, intersects with critical infrastructure deficits across multiple sectors. The country faces a strained electricity grid, limited gas pipeline infrastructure, water scarcity in regions targeted for hydrogen production, and port facilities ranked among the world’s least efficient.

These vulnerabilities create conditions where any promise of development becomes difficult to refuse, regardless of its terms. While South Africa mobilises its renewable energy resources to serve European decarbonisation goals, millions of its citizens continue to experience energy insecurity through persistent load-shedding. Even green fertilisers produced from hydrogen remain unaffordable for smallholder farmers.

Renewable energy generation for hydrogen production requires vast territorial appropriations that bring industrial development into direct conflict with existing land uses. Hydrogen production is particularly water-intensive, exacerbating water scarcity in arid regions like the Northern Cape, where major projects are planned.

The transformation of strategic ‘Hydrogen Hubs’ treats these regions as abstract spaces for industrial development rather than lived environments sustaining cultural identity and economic security. Sasol’s Boegoebaai hydrogen cluster in the Northern Cape, spanning 60,000 hectares, risks dispossessing the indigenous Nama people of their ancestral lands.

Similarly, the deep-water port and desalination facility to support hydrogen production risks disrupting marine ecosystems due to brine discharge, increased salinity, and thermal pollution from desalination plants. The fishing community also face displacement and loss of livelihoods, especially in areas like Port Nolloth.

Mpumalanga, long devastated as a sacrifice zone for coal production, has suffered from severe air pollution, land degradation, and widespread health impacts. The province is now home to three major green hydrogen projects being developed on land leased from Eskom, near existing coal infrastructure: Sasol Hyshift in Secunda, Camden Green Hydrogen and Ammonia in Ermelo, and HDF Renewstable Mpumalanga in Standerton.

This new wave of industrial transformation risks further marginalising local communities by concentrating the burdens of both the old carbon economy and the emerging green economy.

Contested vision of just transition

Despite the policy rhetoric emphasising ‘just transition’ — the shift to a low-carbon economy that ensures fairness and inclusion for workers and communities affected by the transition – current arrangements demonstrate a significant disconnect between transformative aspirations and material realities.

The Just Energy Transition Investment Plan shows a striking imbalance between infrastructural spending on large-scale export projects and social investments in community benefits and addressing energy poverty. Of the 1.5 trillion rand total investment, only 60.4 billion rand specifically targets just transition initiatives in Mpumalanga, the province most affected by coal sector transitions.

European hydrogen strategies, including the EU Hydrogen Strategy and related initiatives like the European Hydrogen Backbone and Clean Hydrogen Partnership, focus on industrial competitiveness, infrastructure development, and decarbonisation targets, completely ignoring community consultation. This systematic exclusion occurs despite South Africa’s constitutional commitments to democratic governance and communities’ rights to clean water and land.

There is an urgent call for a justice-centred ‘post-extractivist transition’, one that envisions development beyond resource extraction, prioritising ecological sustainability, community autonomy, and equitable benefit-sharing across Africa. This approach should centre local control in global climate and energy debates. While some level of resource extraction may be necessary to support the energy transition, such activities must reinforce rather than erode community rights, environmental stewardship, and inclusive development.

A justice-centred post-extractivist transition should restructure international energy and trade relationships to centre genuine community participation in project design and ownership structures, recognising communities’ right to refuse projects that don’t serve their interests, regardless of broader climate justifications. Instead of treating consultation as a mere procedural requirement, it should embed community veto power into governance structures and ensure affected populations maintain meaningful control over decisions affecting their territories.

Projects should demonstrate direct contributions to addressing energy poverty and strengthening local economies through community ownership models, local manufacturing capacity, and revenue sharing that enhances rather than displaces existing economic activities. The land-intensive nature of renewable energy infrastructure makes territorial rights central, requiring integration of renewable development with existing land uses and community priorities.

South Africa faces conflicting development visions: one treating the continent as an extraction zone serving global markets, and another positioning renewable energy as a foundation for energy sovereignty, democratic participation, and equitable development.

Current policy trajectories lean heavily toward the former, but structural contradictions point to the need for alternative visions. Alternative visions must challenge the financial, trade, and governance frameworks that privilege Global North interests over Global South priorities.

South Africa could leverage its strategic position differently. Rather than competing to offer the most attractive investment incentives, it could coordinate with other African hydrogen producers to establish minimum standards for foreign investment, similar to how oil-producing nations have used collective bargaining. Regional cooperation could help resist the race-to-the-bottom dynamics that characterise current negotiations.

While the global energy transition shows signs of reproducing historical patterns of extraction, it also holds the potential to become a foundation for more equitable international trade relations. The direction ultimately depends on whose interests shape the transition’s terms and whose voices are centred in energy governance. A justice-centred post-extractivist transition must recognise the complementarity of climate action and decolonisation, and pursue these together.

The hydrogen economy is still emerging, and its final structure remains contested. Decisions made in the coming years about ownership models, governance frameworks, and benefit-sharing mechanisms will determine whether this transition strengthens or undermines the prospects for genuine sustainable development in South Africa — and whether it becomes an effective tool for global decarbonisation.

At the Africa Climate Summit 2025 held in Addis Ababa in September 2025, leaders and experts explored ways Africa can benefit more from its resources.

Under the theme “Accelerating renewable energy, nature-based solutions, e-mobility, and scaling up climate finance,” the Summit sought ways to build a resilient and prosperous future for Africa. The important question, however, was whether Africa would continue exporting its raw materials for others to reap the profit or seize this moment and drive the agenda of its transformation.

Speaking at the Summit, the Executive Secretary of the UN Economic Commission for Africa (ECA), Claver Gatete, called for a united African front in order to leverage these resources strategically.

“We cannot afford to repeat the exploitative patterns of the past,” he said. “Africa must industrialise using its own resources, creating jobs and sustainable growth of our people.”

The current net-zero clean energy race has triggered surging global demand for minerals used in batteries, solar panels and wind turbines, of which Africa is a key supplier.

Mr. Gatete emphasised the need for African governments to invest in local processing, value addition, and stronger regional cooperation, and avoid exporting raw minerals.

Risks and opportunities

The Summit highlighted both opportunities and risks. On one hand, critical minerals could generate billions in revenue, accelerate clean industrialisation and help Africa achieve the SDGs.

On the other hand, unchecked extraction will not benefit Africans and would worsen inequality and environmental degradation.

Mr. Gatete called for building continental capacity to process, refine, and manufacture components like batteries within Africa. He cited the ECA—Afreximbank Battery and Electric Vehicle (BEV) value chain initiative, launched in the DRC and Zambia, to build special economic zones (SEZ) for producing electric vehicle battery precursor and components as a concrete example of this shift “from resource extraction to technological innovation and prioritisation of local value addition.”

To expand this further, participants emphasised the importance of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) to develop integrated regional value chains, reduce external dependence, and unlock economies of scale. In the same breath, they called for continental unity to avoid fragmented national policies that could weaken Africa’s bargaining power.

To address this, ECA proposed the formation of African Critical Minerals Alliance—to harmonise regulations, negotiate better trade deals and promote intra-African collaborations.

“Unity is our strength,” Mr. Gatete reminded participants. “By working together, African countries can ensure that green minerals become a foundation for prosperity, not another lost opportunity.”

Africa’s financing gap for climate action was also discussed at the Summit, with leaders renewing their calls for increased international climate finance, debt relief and technology transfer. They also underscore the importance of the private sector investment aimed at strengthening regional value chains, building local processing capacity and expanding critical infrastructure.

The Africa Climate Summit 2025 ended with the adoption of the Addis Ababa Declaration, a renewed commitment to place sustainability, equity, and local development at the heart of mineral exploitation. The message was clear—Africa holds the key to the global green transition. The challenge now is how to turn that potential into lasting, inclusive prosperity for its people.

Financial advisor Winnie Sun published an article in Forbes that breaks down key trends in the solar industry and highlights the pros and cons of leasing versus buying panels. One of the main changes in the solar industry is the decrease in installation costs. Sun wrote that ""the cost to install solar has plummeted by more than half over the last decade.""

Installing a solar system for your home is one of the most effective ways to save on your utility bills while sheltering your home from rising energy prices. Whether you decide to lease or purchase panels for your home ultimately depends on your budget and long-term housing situation.

""It's worth leasing if the costs to do so are cheaper than your current electricity bill,"" Sun wrote. ""If you can afford it, it's generally better to buy, especially if you plan to stay in your home for at least seven years.""

Solar roofing delivers exactly this for heritage buildings.","Heritage buildings face a dilemma – how to embrace the future without erasing the past.

As clean technologies and renewable energy gain momentum across the UK and beyond, historic buildings face increasing pressure to reduce their carbon footprint. This is, in part, intensified by concerns around their typically poor energy efficiency, often a result of age, design and traditional construction materials.

Many sustainable retrofits – such as LED lighting, heat pumps, and improved insulation – have proven relatively straightforward to implement without compromising the integrity or appearance of heritage and listed buildings. The integration of solar technology, however, has not always been readily accepted or implemented.

Solar roofing: Preserving the past while powering the future

Solar is one of the fastest-growing renewable energy sources in the world, but both official heritage guidelines and public opinion have indicated concern about the visual impact of traditional rooftop solar panels on historic buildings. The core challenge lies in reconciling modern, often bulky, technology with the architectural integrity and charm of the past.

Rooftops are ideal for solar installations, thanks to their unobstructed access to sunlight and efficient use of space. However, traditional solar panels can be visually intrusive – especially on heritage and protected buildings.

This is where building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) solar roofs come in: seamlessly integrated into the roof structure, they enable protected buildings to adopt clean energy without compromising aesthetics.

Blending into the architecture, quality solar roofing is often described as “invisible”. BIPV technology has now advanced to support buildings with distinctively coloured roofs – such as green oxidised copper or terracotta tiles – by offering solar materials in matching shades, allowing discreet rooftop solar integration for the first time.

UK heritage guidance embraces solar, but adoption remains limited

As the UK Government rolls out its ambitious Clean Power 2030 Action Plan – targeting 45–47 GW of solar generation capacity by 2030 – heritage organisations have also become increasingly committed to integrating solar into their properties and guidance policies; albeit with caution to protect visual appearance.

For example, Historic England updated its guidance in July 2024 to clarify that – with the necessary permissions and careful visual planning – solar panels can be appropriately integrated into heritage buildings. Prior to this, installations were often hindered by inconsistent decision-making across local councils.

However, despite this policy progress, uptake remains low. A government-commissioned review found that 87% of heritage building owners perceive listed-building consent as a barrier, and 75% say it prevents energy efficiency upgrades. In practice, only a small fraction of heritage buildings currently feature solar installations, highlighting the failure of standard panels to win widespread acceptance.

York Minster: The exception that proves the rule

Leading the way among religious buildings, the Church of England (one of the UK’s largest heritage custodians) pledged net-zero carbon emissions across its buildings by 2030. A recent example of solar integration is the iconic York Minster, which activated 184 solar panels in January 2025. These panels, discreetly positioned on the South Quire roof, will generate around 70,000 kWh annually – roughly a third of the Minster’s electricity demand.

Yet the installation drew public criticism: “Fitting panels to a historic building like that seems absurd…” and “That seems wrong on a historic building. I’m pro solar panels, but I don’t think they’re appropriate everywhere” are just two of the comments made by local members of the public when the solar plans were announced. This underscores how traditional panels can still clash with heritage sensibilities and deter broader adoption.

Still, the emissions and cost-savings potential of solar for heritage buildings is hard to ignore.

Bath Abbey offers a compelling feasibility study on solar’s potential: modelling suggests 164 PV panels could generate around 45 MWh per year – 35% of its annual usage – saving 10 tonnes of CO₂ annually, with payback in 13 years and a projected profit of £139,000 over 25 years.

Gloucester Cathedral – which installed 150 solar panels on its nave roof in 2016 – has reduced its energy costs by over 25%. It is considered the oldest UK cathedral with a solar installation, but one of many historic religious buildings in the UK to make such a move.

BIPV: The solution for widespread adoption

Rather than relying on rare, high-profile exceptions, the heritage sector now needs a solution built for scale – BIPV solar roofing delivers this.

Instead of ‘clashing’ with history, integrated solar roofing:

Merges with the existing roofline, avoiding the ‘stuck-on’ look

Mimics traditional materials like slate, terracotta or oxidised copper with coloured options

Eliminates the most significant barriers – visual impact and public resistance – by remaining discreet.

As Sonia Dunlop, CEO of the Global Solar Council, puts it, “In some cases, BIPV could be appropriate” for historic buildings, highlighting that suitable technology already exists today to meet the needs of heritage custodians.

Mock-up images of Westminster Abbey (top) and Canterbury Cathedral (bottom) demonstrating how the buildings would look if retrofitted with BIPV solar roofing

Westminster Abbey and Canterbury Cathedral are two examples of iconic UK heritage buildings which have not yet adopted solar PV despite the Church of England initiatives. Their esteemed heritage status rightly calls for more careful scrutiny of how installations might impact aesthetics.

Solar roofing offers a solution. Instead of traditional panels that may jar with the fabric of these sites, mock-ups show how discreet BIPV roofing could be applied seamlessly – maintaining their tradition and style whilst generating clean, renewable energy to keep the buildings running. For custodians of these buildings, this is the first credible way to reconcile climate action with heritage protection.

Balancing preservation with progress

Renewable energy is the future – and soon, even the most exceptional buildings will need to adapt. The key is applying innovative, tailored solutions that support organisations in making the transition – with respect for their values and context. Solar roofing delivers exactly this for heritage buildings.

It’s a two-way street: if we're asking heritage organisations to commit to climate action, we must also respect their stewardship of historic fabric and place. That’s the difference between symbolic early adoption and genuine, scaled climate leadership.

Marrying the past with the future may not be straightforward – but it's essential. These treasured buildings will only endure if we protect both their history and the planet they stand on.

This collaboration marks a significant step toward taking GM’s advanced battery technology beyond EVs and builds on GM and Redwood’s existing collaboration.

“The market for grid-scale batteries and backup power isn’t just expanding, it’s becoming essential infrastructure,” said Kurt Kelty, vice president of batteries, propulsion and sustainability at GM. “Electricity demand is climbing, and it’s only going to accelerate. To meet that challenge, the U.S. needs energy storage solutions that can be deployed quickly, economically and made right here at home. GM batteries can play an integral role. We’re not just making better cars – we’re shaping the future of energy resilience.”

In June, Redwood Materials launched Redwood Energy, a new business that deploys both used EV packs and new modules into fast, low-cost energy-storage systems built to meet surging power demand from AI data centers and other applications. The memorandum enables Redwood to pair that integration expertise with both second-life GM EV packs and U.S.-built batteries, delivering a domestic solution from cell to system.

Already, GM second-life electric vehicle batteries are being repurposed to help power the largest second-life battery development in the world and the largest microgrid in North America, at Redwood’s 12MW/63MWh installation in Sparks, Nevada, supporting the AI infrastructure company Crusoe.

“Electricity demand is accelerating at an unprecedented pace, driven by AI and the rapid electrification of everything from transportation to industry,” said JB Straubel, founder and chief executive officer of Redwood Materials. “Both GM’s second-life EV batteries and new batteries can be deployed in Redwood’s energy storage systems, delivering fast, flexible power solutions and strengthening America’s energy and manufacturing independence.”

U.S. electricity demand continues to grow, driven in part by AI data centers that are on track to triple their share of national electricity usage from 4.4 percent in 2023 to 12 percent by 2028. As power consumption increases, there’s an expanding need for energy storage systems that can act to offset power outages and reinforce the grid when demand is high or supply is limited.

UK: National Grid has joined the Northern Powerhouse Partnership (NPP), strengthening its commitment to expanding clean-energy infrastructure, developing local skills, and supporting economic growth across the North of England. The move comes as part of The Great Grid Upgrade, the company’s wide-ranging investment programme designed to connect more affordable, home-grown renewable power to the national network.

The announcement was marked at the Eastern Green Link 2 (EGL2) converter station visitor centre in Wren Hall, recently opened by Keir Mather MP. The event brought together apprentices, industry leaders and regional partners, highlighting the collaboration behind the upgrade programme.

National Grid’s major projects in the North include Eastern Green Link 1 and 2, Yorkshire Green, and proposed developments such as the Cross Border Connection and North Humber to High Marnham. Collectively, the company’s network investment is expected to support up to 55,000 jobs across the UK by 2030, with a significant share in northern communities.

The economic impact is already visible. On EGL2 alone, construction partner BAM is creating around 200 roles, including apprenticeships and specialist engineering jobs. ‘Meet the buyer’ events for EGL1 and EGL2 have helped hundreds of northern SMEs access new opportunities in civil works, cabling, transport, environmental services and technical design. METLEN, delivering the EGL1 converter station, has so far awarded contracts worth around $225,000 (£170,000) to small and medium enterprises.

National Grid is also upgrading Grid Supply Points and replacing overhead line crossings, such as the River Tyne, with modern cable tunnel solutions to support regional transport, industry and long-term growth.

BACKGROUND The CWA applies to ""navigable waters,"" which is defined as ""the waters of the United States, including the territorial seas,"" but the CWA does not further define WOTUS.
EPA and the Corps would apply a two-prong test requiring both: (1) abutment of a jurisdictional water; and (2) having surface water at least during the wet season.
Eliminations The Proposed Rule would eliminate jurisdictional triggers for interstate waters that are disconnected from traditionally navigable waters.
However, the Proposed Rule is unexpectedly vague and deferential on many details for Agencies to define the limits of the rule.","On November 20, 2025, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (Proposed Rule) in the Federal Register to update several regulatory definitions defining ""Waters of the United States"" (WOTUS) under the Clean Water Act (CWA).

The Proposed Rule is a culmination of decades of agency and judicial process that at times narrowed and expanded the scope of federal jurisdiction over our nation's waters. Driven by the Supreme Court's 2023 ruling in Sackett v. Environmental Protection Agency (Sackett), the Trump Administration is poised to change the definition of WOTUS to limit federal jurisdiction. These changes are intended to respect State and Tribal authority and promote regulatory certainty and clarity.

As further explained below, the Proposed Rule would clarify the definition of WOTUS by defining ""continuous surface connection,"" ""relatively permanent,"" and ""tributaries,"" and would clarify several exemptions under the CWA. Additionally, the Proposed Rule would add a new exemption for groundwater and would eliminate interstate waters that don't themselves independently qualify as WOTUS from federal jurisdiction.

EPA and the Corps are also inviting comments on alternative approaches and additional revisions to the WOTUS definition and its implementation. Comments must be received on or before January 5, 2026.

BACKGROUND

The CWA applies to ""navigable waters,"" which is defined as ""the waters of the United States, including the territorial seas,"" but the CWA does not further define WOTUS. This lack of statutory definition has resulted in ambiguity, protracted rulemaking, and decades of litigation over the breadth of WOTUS.

Most recently, the U.S. Supreme Court addressed the definition of WOTUS in Sackett. The Court adopted a narrow interpretation of WOTUS, holding that the CWA's use of ""waters"" encompasses ""only those relatively permanent, standing or continuously flowing bodies of water 'forming geographical features,'"" such as streams, oceans, rivers and lakes. Similarly, Sackett concluded that the Agencies' definition of ""adjacent,"" used to determine whether a wetland constituted a jurisdictional water under the CWA, was too broad, and affirmed that the ""continuous surface connection"" test is the appropriate standard. Shortly thereafter, the Corps and EPA under the Biden Administration promulgated regulations conforming the regulatory definition of WOTUS to the Sackett decision (Amended 2023 Rule). EPA and the Corps are now proposing to revise the definition again to address concerns raised by stakeholders about the Amended 2023 Rule, including assertions that the Amended 2023 Rule does not adequately comply with the Supreme Court's interpretation in Sackett of the scope of Federal jurisdiction and implementation-related issues.

For additional background and history of the WOTUS saga, refer to Van Ness Feldman's past alerts and notices.1

KEY CHANGES

Definitions:

The most significant proposed changes would revise the definitions of two terms that guide whether a water is a WOTUS or not: ""relatively permanent"" and ""continuous surface connection."" The rule also clarifies the definition of ""tributaries."" Each term plays an important role in determining whether a particular water qualifies as a WOTUS.

WOTUS includes (1) traditional navigable waters and the territorial seas; (2) most impoundments of ""waters of the United States;"" (3) relatively permanent tributaries of traditional navigable waters, the territorial seas, and impoundments; (4) wetlands adjacent (i.e., having a continuous surface connection) to traditional navigable waters, impoundments, and tributaries; and (5) lakes and ponds that are relatively permanent and have a continuous surface connection to a traditional navigable water, the territorial seas, or a tributary.

Relatively Permanent. The Proposed Rule would define ""relatively permanent"" to mean ""standing or continuously flowing bodies of surface water that are standing or continuously flowing year-round or at least during the wet season."" The relatively permanent definition applies to tributaries, lakes and ponds, and adjacent wetlands.

With the addition of ""at least during the wet season,"" the Agencies propose to add a temporal element to the test. ""Wet season"" would be defined using existing agency tools, and quantitatively as the point at which ""precipitation exceeds evapotranspiration,"" and would vary by geographic region and ecotype. Significantly, water must stand or flow for the entirety of the wet season to qualify as ""relatively permanent;"" intermittent flow, or longer flow not occurring during the wet season do not qualify as relatively permanent waters. The Agencies are soliciting comments on alternative methods that could better define the wet season given site and region-specific factors.

Continuous surface connection. The Proposed Rule would define a continuous surface connection as one ""having surface water at least during the wet season and abutting (i.e., touching) a jurisdictional water.""

EPA and the Corps would apply a two-prong test requiring both: (1) abutment of a jurisdictional water; and (2) having surface water at least during the wet season. The Agencies explain that this is meant to limit the scope of jurisdictional wetlands by suggesting that even if a wetland is more broadly delineated, only those portions of the wetland that have surface water that abuts or touches a jurisdictional water during the wet season are under federal jurisdiction.

Tributaries. The Proposed Rule would redefine tributaries as ""bod[ies] of water with relatively permanent flow, and a bed and bank, that connects to a downstream traditional navigable water or the territorial seas, either directly or through one or more waters or features that convey relatively permanent flow.""

This definition expressly excludes ""a body of water that contributes surface water flow to a downstream jurisdictional water through [natural or artificial] feature[s]... if such feature does not convey relatively permanent flow."" However, tributaries do include natural, man-altered, and man-made waterbodies, such as rivers, streams, ditches, canals, lakes, ponds, and impoundments,"" as long as they connect to a downstream traditionally navigable water. Tributaries may connect through non-jurisdictional features, so long as those features convey relatively permanent flow.

Exclusions

The Proposed Rule would modify three existing jurisdictional exclusions for waste treatment systems, prior converted cropland, and ditches, and adds a new exclusion related to groundwater.

Waste water systems. The Proposed Rule would continue an existing exclusion for waste treatment systems, and define ""waste treatment systems"" as ""including all components of a waste treatment system designed to meet the requirements of the [CWA], including lagoons and treatment ponds (such as settling or cooling ponds), designed to either convey or retain, concentrate, settle, reduce, or remove pollutants, either actively or passively, from wastewater prior to discharge (or eliminating any such discharge).""

By adding this definition, the Proposed Rule appears to expand the scope of the exclusion to include all components of a waste treatment system. The Preamble of the Proposed Rule acknowledges that a cooling pond constructed within a WOTUS would be excluded from WOTUS jurisdiction provided it complies with CWA requirements.

Prior Converted Cropland. The Proposed Rule continues the long-standing exclusion of prior converted cropland, but clarifies that the exclusion does not apply to abandoned cropland. The Agencies propose that prior converted cropland is considered abandoned if it is not used for, or in support of, agricultural purposes at least once in the immediately preceding five years. The Proposed Rule also explains that agricultural uses can include myriad conservation and non-extractive uses, providing that the Agencies' new list of agricultural uses ""may not be obvious to Corps field staff,"" such that the Corps can rely on public or private documentation that the land is being used in accordance with the agricultural uses set forth in the rule.

Ditches. The Proposed Rule would clarify the types of ditches that are excluded from WOTUS jurisdiction, explaining that non navigable ditches that are constructed or excavated ""entirely in dry land"" are not WOTUS. The Proposed Rule explains that ditches that channel or relocate jurisdictional tributaries maintain their jurisdictional status if the tributary continues to meet the regulatory definition of a tributary.

New exception for groundwater. The Proposed Rule explains that groundwater has never been interpreted as WOTUS, explaining that groundwater is by nature not navigable. However, ""surface expressions of groundwater,"" like groundwater that emerges from the ground and becomes baseflow in a relatively permanent stream, are not subject to the exclusion and would continue to be subject to federal jurisdiction if they otherwise meet the requirements of a WOTUS.

Eliminations

The Proposed Rule would eliminate jurisdictional triggers for interstate waters that are disconnected from traditionally navigable waters. Eliminating these triggers would remove lakes and streams that straddle state borders, that do not themselves independently meet the regulatory definition of a WOTUS. The Agencies reason that this has been a consistent source of litigation, reads out ""navigable"" from the statute, and is ultimately not supported by Sackett or Rapanos v. United States (Rapanos). The Proposed Rule provides that nonjurisdictional interstate waters are appropriately regulated by the ""States and Tribes under their sovereign authorities.""

Additionally, the Proposed Rule would restrict mosaic wetlands to the individual wetland segments, which previously together constituted a single wetland comprising the hydrologically connected segments. In particular, this has significant implications for jurisdictional determinations in Alaska, where permafrost wetlands have long been regulated under the mosaic wetland interpretation.

Additionally, the Agencies are seeking comment regarding whether to adopt a USDA definition of wetland under the Food Security Act that expressly excludes certain permafrost wetlands in lands with high agricultural potential in Alaska.

Implications

The Proposed Rule would limit the scope of federal jurisdiction over the nation's waters and correspondingly reduce the federal regulatory burden and compliance issues for work done in and near waters that are no longer considered jurisdictional. We would anticipate a significant reduction in the number of Section 404 permits and associated CWA 401 water quality certifications. However, the Proposed Rule is unexpectedly vague and deferential on many details for Agencies to define the limits of the rule.

Once finalized, additional litigation on the final rule is almost certain to occur.

Furthermore, irrespective of this rulemaking, states and Tribes will likely use their own regulatory authority to fill the gap left by Sackett and the finalized rule. States, including Washington, have ongoing rulemaking processes to further develop their regulatory authority over state waters.

""As India moves closer to its goal of becoming a $ 5 trillion economy, advancing a green economy is no longer a choice but a strategic necessity.
Advt At the centre of the push is the need for strong transition finance, circularity, and improved reporting systems.
Banerjee said, ""As India strides forward on its path of green transition, it is imperative to have a holistic approach to decarbonisation where transition finance, circularity and a robust ESG reporting ecosystem are prioritised, in addition to the focus on renewables and green mobility.""
To address the gap, Banerjee has suggested creating a Green Finance Institution (GFI) that can bring in large-scale, low-cost capital.","The Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) has called for a holistic green transition that strengthens finance, boosts recycling systems, and simplifies environmental approvals, saying this shift is essential as India moves closer to its $ 5 trillion economy goal.

Elaborating on the CII Proposals in this area, Chandrajit Banerjee, Director General, CII, underlined that India needs a green transition not as a choice but as a strategic requirement for long-term growth. ""As India moves closer to its goal of becoming a $ 5 trillion economy, advancing a green economy is no longer a choice but a strategic necessity. This transition is vital not only for meeting climate goals but also for shaping India's long-term growth, competitiveness, and global standing,"" said Banerjee.

At the centre of the push is the need for strong transition finance, circularity, and improved reporting systems. Banerjee said, ""As India strides forward on its path of green transition, it is imperative to have a holistic approach to decarbonisation where transition finance, circularity and a robust ESG reporting ecosystem are prioritised, in addition to the focus on renewables and green mobility.""

According to him, India needs nearly $ 1 trillion in green investments over the next 10 to 15 years, and close to $ 10 trillion by 2070, to reach its net-zero goal. But current finance flows meet only about one-fourth of this requirement. To address the gap, Banerjee has suggested creating a Green Finance Institution (GFI) that can bring in large-scale, low-cost capital. The body can be set up in GIFT City and supported by global funds without needing direct government spending. It can offer concessional finance, equity support, guarantees, and securitisation to bring down project costs across renewable energy, clean mobility, green buildings and industrial decarbonisation.

Banerjee also proposed a ""Green Tech Expo Fund"" to help Indian clean-tech companies participate in global technology events. The idea is to push India's growing innovations in green technology onto the world stage and build partnerships with global investors and buyers.

He further highlighted the strong need for a recycling strategy for critical minerals like lithium, cobalt and nickel, as India depends heavily on imports. Rules for mandatory recycling of batteries and electronics, fast-track clearances, and incentives for domestic recovery of minerals, were also suggested. Banerjee recommended creating Circular Economy Parks for waste like plastics, tyres, e-waste and batteries, with 15 parks in three years and 45 in five years.

Advt

To make approvals faster and clearer, Banerjee has proposed a unified Environmental and Climate Clearance Authority with a fully digital system and automatic approvals within fixed timelines for projects that meet low-emission and sustainability norms. He also stressed the need for energy-efficient buildings, recommending a National Digitalization of Built Environment Initiative and uniform adoption of building energy codes.

As India builds for the future, the shift must go beyond electric vehicles and renewable power to include green finance, easier environmental processes, stronger recycling systems and sustainable buildings. ""These are vital for not only building a resilient, innovative, and inclusive economy but also offer significant untapped opportunities for investors looking to capitalise on these transformative trends,"" Banerjee said.

The public charging network shrinks at the exact moment Maryland needs it to expand.","Maryland set a bold goal of 1.1 million electric vehicles on the road by 2030. With just shy of 150,000 EVs registered as of October 2025, the state has ground to make up.

That growth depends on a public charging network that is reliable, affordable and widely available, especially for apartment and condo dwellers without home charging and for drivers crossing the state on longer trips. Public charging must keep pace. Yet a new regulation from the Maryland Department of Agriculture threatens to do the opposite.

Starting Jan. 1, 2026, every public charging station in Maryland that accepts payment must register with the state’s Weights and Measures program and pay a $150 annual fee. That is per port. A simple four-plug Level 2 station at a grocery store, office garage, or apartment complex now owes Maryland $600 a year just to remain in service.

The state calls it a registration fee. In practice, it operates as a $150-per-port tax, perhaps the highest in the nation. For comparison, Maryland charges gas stations only $20 to register each fuel dispenser. An EV charging plug now costs 7.5 times more to keep legal than a gasoline nozzle.

The Maryland Department of Agriculture is gearing up for enforcement. Chargers not registered by Jan. 1 face being red-tagged with a stop-use order. This removes the unit from service entirely. Every fix requires a registered service agency to sign off on repairs, and those technicians charge real money.

In spring 2026, state inspectors will arrive with certified test equipment to verify that each charger meters electricity within tolerances. New chargers must be certified before operating. The cost of compliance begins long before the first kilowatt-hour is sold.

Large fast-charging networks will simply take this in stride and raise rates a few cents. The damage falls hardest on low-margin Level 2 stations that drivers rely on daily. Apartment complexes, hotel lots, small retail centers, and office buildings often run these chargers at break-even or as customer perks.

A substantial yearly charger tax transforms a goodwill gesture into a financial liability. Many hosts will run the numbers, see red ink, and simply rip out the equipment rather than pass the cost to users or risk repeated red tags for minor violations.

Charger hosts lose the incentive to keep stations online. Drivers lose convenient charging options. The public charging network shrinks at the exact moment Maryland needs it to expand.

By 2026, compliant chargers will sport a little MDA decal proving they are registered. What many won’t see will be the faint outlines on the pavement where perfectly functional Level 2 chargers once stood, quietly removed because the juice just wasn’t worth the squeeze.",https://cdn.newsfromthestates.com/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-101/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/54918991226_f8b0d3035c_o-1024x7681764557690.jpg?h=ddb1ad0c&itok=or7AvzVL,N,,2025-11-30 23:58:10.431753

The manufacturing industry has long been a cornerstone of the Southern economy. From chemical plants along the Gulf Coast to food processing facilities across the region, these industries have provided jobs, growth, and stability for decades. However, traditional manufacturing has often relied heavily on fossil fuels and energy-intensive processes. This has led to growing concerns about environmental impact and long-term sustainability.

Today, many Southern manufacturers are taking significant steps to reduce their environmental footprint. By adopting sustainable practices, companies are finding ways to improve efficiency, cut costs, and meet increasing consumer and regulatory demands for cleaner operations. Tyler Pommier, a renewable energy executive based in Baton Rouge, observes that the move toward sustainability is not just about compliance. “Companies are recognizing that being sustainable is good for business and good for the community,” he says.

Energy Efficiency in Manufacturing

One of the first areas manufacturers are addressing is energy consumption. Modernizing equipment, upgrading lighting, and installing energy management systems can reduce electricity usage significantly. Factories are investing in high-efficiency motors, variable-speed drives, and smart HVAC systems to optimize energy performance.

Solar and wind energy are also becoming part of the solution. Companies are installing rooftop solar panels or participating in community solar programs to supplement their energy needs with renewable sources. These steps not only reduce greenhouse gas emissions but also lower operating costs over time.

Tyler Pommier emphasizes that energy efficiency is often the simplest and most impactful starting point. “You do not have to wait for new technology to make a difference,” he notes. “Even small improvements in energy management can lead to substantial savings and environmental benefits.”

Water Conservation and Waste Reduction

Manufacturing processes often consume large amounts of water and generate waste. Many Southern companies are implementing water recycling and treatment systems to reduce consumption and limit pollution. By reusing water within production cycles, factories can cut costs and reduce their impact on local waterways.

In addition, waste reduction programs are becoming more common. Manufacturers are rethinking materials, optimizing supply chains, and finding ways to recycle byproducts instead of sending them to landfills. Some companies have even started using waste as a raw material for other processes, creating a circular economy that benefits both business and the environment.

“Water and waste are two areas where manufacturers can make real changes without sacrificing productivity,” Tyler Pommier says. “It requires planning and investment, but the results speak for themselves.”

Clean Energy and Industrial Innovation

Beyond efficiency and conservation, Southern manufacturers are exploring cleaner energy sources. Combined heat and power systems, hydrogen energy, and bioenergy are emerging as viable options for industrial applications. These technologies provide reliable energy while reducing emissions and reliance on fossil fuels.

Some manufacturers are integrating smart technology to monitor and optimize their operations in real time. Sensors, data analytics, and automation allow companies to detect inefficiencies, predict maintenance needs, and adjust energy usage dynamically. This approach not only supports sustainability but also enhances productivity and reduces downtime.

The combination of clean energy and smart technology is redefining what it means to be a modern manufacturer. It is no longer just about producing goods efficiently. It is about producing them responsibly, with a focus on long-term environmental and economic benefits.

Economic and Community Benefits

Sustainable manufacturing brings benefits beyond environmental impact. It creates new jobs, attracts investment, and strengthens local economies. Skilled positions are needed to design, install, and maintain renewable energy systems and smart manufacturing technologies. This opens opportunities for workers who may have previously relied solely on traditional roles.

Communities also benefit when manufacturers reduce pollution and use resources responsibly. Cleaner air, reduced water contamination, and lower greenhouse gas emissions improve public health and quality of life. Companies that prioritize sustainability often build stronger relationships with local stakeholders and gain trust within their regions.

Overcoming Challenges

Transitioning to sustainable practices is not without challenges. Initial costs for new technology, energy systems, and process upgrades can be significant. Some companies may also face regulatory hurdles or uncertainty about the return on investment.

Education and planning are essential. Leaders must assess their current operations, identify areas for improvement, and develop realistic strategies. Collaboration with renewable energy experts, technology providers, and community partners can make the transition smoother and more effective.

Tyler Pommier stresses that persistence and vision are key. “Sustainability is a journey, not a single project,” he explains. “The companies that succeed are those that are willing to invest in the long term and continuously improve.”

Success Stories Across the South

Several Southern manufacturers are already showing how sustainability can work in practice. Chemical plants are using bio-based feedstocks, food processing facilities are implementing water-saving measures, and automotive suppliers are reducing energy consumption with smart systems. These examples demonstrate that environmental responsibility and industrial growth can go hand in hand.

States like Louisiana, Georgia, and Texas are supporting these efforts through grants, incentives, and technical assistance. Public-private partnerships are helping manufacturers adopt renewable energy, modernize equipment, and train their workforce for a sustainable future.

The Future of Green Manufacturing

The future of manufacturing in the South is being shaped by sustainability, technology, and innovation. Companies that embrace these principles will not only reduce their environmental impact but also strengthen their competitiveness and resilience.

As Tyler Pommier notes, “The South has an incredible opportunity to lead in sustainable industry. By combining innovation with our traditional strengths, we can build a manufacturing sector that is cleaner, smarter, and more resilient for generations to come.”

From energy efficiency to clean technology, from waste reduction to smart systems, the South is reimagining its industrial future. Green manufacturing is no longer an option; it is a necessary evolution. The region is proving that economic growth and environmental responsibility can go hand in hand, paving the way for a stronger, more sustainable Southern economy.",https://microgridmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image1.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 03:58:49.129706

President Xi Jinping has put forward the concept that ""lucid waters and lush mountains are invaluable assets"". Embracing this concept, China has undergone a fundamental shift in its economic development paradigm. As a responsible manufacturing powerhouse, China is advancing new industrialization as a key task, with green and low-carbon development as its ecological foundation. By reducing carbon emissions, curbing pollution, expanding green initiatives and fostering economic growth, China contributes its wisdom and solutions to global sustainability.

Strengthening green vision guidance

Ideas guide actions, and the deep impetus for the green transition of China's sprawling manufacturing sector stems from President Xi's ecological civilization concept. The belief that ""lucid waters and lush mountains are invaluable assets"" transcends the traditional industrial paradigm, setting China on a path of high-quality growth coupled with high-level environmental protection. Guided by this vision, China has established a ""1+N"" policy framework for carbon peak and carbon neutrality, translating these ambitious goals into actionable and measurable steps. Through tools like setting green standards, promoting green finance and building carbon trading markets, China has created a stable and predictable market environment for green transition.

In recent years, China's economic growth has been relying less on energy consumption. From 2021 to 2024, China recorded an average annual industrial growth rate of over 5 percent with only around 3 percent annual growth in energy consumption. This green transition has unleashed robust new economic momentum: China has built the world's largest new energy industry chain. In 2024, China's total installed capacity of wind and solar power exceeded 1.2 billion kilowatts, achieving the 2030 installation target in Nationally Determined Contributions six years ahead of schedule. Today, over half of the world's electric vehicles run on Chinese roadways.

Deepening green tech innovation

Technological innovation is the core driver of the green transition in manufacturing. China has integrated green technology innovation into its national innovation system, achieving remarkable results through strategic government support, economies of scale and industrial synergy. According to the 2024 China Patent Survey Report by the China National Intellectual Property Administration, nearly half of Chinese enterprises have engaged in, or plan to pursue, green technology innovation.

Over the past decade, China has contributed to a cumulative reduction of over 60 percent and 80 percent, respectively, in the global average levelized cost of electricity for wind power and solar photovoltaic technologies.

Breakthroughs have also been made in making traditional industries greener. For instance, Chinese companies have built hydrogen-based metallurgy production lines with an annual production capacity of one million metric tons and green ammonia synthesis production lines with an annual capacity of 300,000 tons, achieving full-process mastery of complex technologies that support these factories. Meanwhile, one-million-ton carbon capture, utilization and storage projects have been completed and put into operation. These advancements lay the groundwork for larger-scale and deeper green transitions of manufacturing.

Popularizing green manufacturing models

Green manufacturing is a modernized production mode characterized by low consumption, low emissions, high efficiency and high returns. China has built a green manufacturing system encompassing green factories, industrial parks, supply chains and products, embedding environmentally friendly development into entire industrial processes. To date, China has cultivated 6,430 green factories, 491 green industrial parks and 727 green supply chain enterprises, while promoting over 40,000 types of green products. Among these, the output value of green factories now accounts for 20 percent of China's total manufacturing output, up from 9 percent in 2020. The energy and water consumption per unit of industrial output in green industrial parks is only two-thirds and one-fourth of the national average, respectively, with their average solid waste utilization rate exceeding 95 percent.

An increasing number of Chinese companies are incorporating green design and procurement into supply chain management, driving upstream and downstream partners to adopt green upgrades. Meanwhile, some industry leaders are pioneering carbon footprint management across product life cycles.

Contributing green transition solutions

By providing high-quality green technologies and products, Chinese manufacturing offers practical pathways for the global green transition. The nation's renewable energy products are exported to over 200 countries and regions, meeting more than 80 percent of global demand for photovoltaic modules and 70 percent for wind power equipment. This helps nations around the world, especially developing countries, access clean, reliable and affordable energy.

For instance, from 2021 to 2024, China produced approximately 15.6 trillion kW of photovoltaic modules, helping the world generate about 3.2 trillion kilowatt-hours of green electricity and reduce carbon dioxide emissions by roughly 2.54 billion tons. China has also collaborated with more than 100 countries and regions on green energy projects, delivering high-quality equipment and affordable green power. These initiatives demonstrate the tangible impact of Chinese solutions in helping other developing nations address climate change while fostering economic growth.

Systematic advancement of green transition

At a time when global climate governance is encountering setbacks and some nations are backsliding on their commitments, China's decision to embark on a green and low-carbon transition for its manufacturing sector serves as a powerful demonstration of its drive to foster new quality productive forces and pursue high-quality development. This choice also stands as a solemn pledge to global climate governance.

In his video speech at the United Nations Climate Summit 2025 in September, President Xi announced China's new NDC targets. China will, by 2035, reduce economy-wide net greenhouse gas emissions by 7 percent to 10 percent from peak levels, striving to do better; increase the share of non-fossil fuels in total energy consumption to over 30 percent; expand the installed capacity of wind and solar power to over six times 2020 levels, striving to bring the total to 3.6 billion kW; scale up the total forest stock volume to over 24 billion cubic meters; make new energy vehicles the mainstream in the sales of new vehicles; expand the National Carbon Emissions Trading Market to cover major high-emission sectors; and basically establish a climate adaptive society.

China's new NDC targets demonstrate a pragmatic and actionable ambition for emission reductions. With manufacturing spearheading the green transformation of our economy and society, China's industrial strategy is now honing in on a systematic transition. Moving forward, efforts will focus on three key fronts — modernizing the industrial system, developing green supply chains and deepening international collaboration.

Building a green industrial system

Traditional industries remain a crucial pillar of Chinese manufacturing. Their transformation and upgrading require systematic adjustments to product mixes, energy consumption patterns and raw material structures, along with the re-engineering of industrial processes. Particular emphasis will be placed on scaling-up the application of innovative technologies in sectors such as steel, building materials and chemicals.

Industries will capitalize on the vast market opportunities created by the green and low-carbon transition. Efforts will be made to vigorously develop green and low-carbon sectors, increasing the share of industries like environmental protection, new energy equipment and NEVs.

Simultaneously, to meet the demands of the energy revolution and industrial transformation under the ""dual carbon"" goals, China will strategically plan and deploy future-oriented energy and manufacturing industries, including hydrogen energy, energy storage, bio-manufacturing and carbon capture, utilization and storage.

Building a green supply chain

China is committed to embedding green development principles throughout the entire manufacturing chain — from raw material procurement to production, sales and recycling. China will drive large enterprises to implement green and low-carbon supply chain enhancement initiatives, leveraging green procurement as a guiding force. Through activities such as green audits and supply chain financing, the initiative will support upstream and downstream suppliers in adopting green upgrades and managing carbon footprints.

The country will also promote the cultivation of green factories, steadily increase the procurement share from green factory suppliers and strengthen international cooperation in building green supply chains. Furthermore, China will advance circular economy models, facilitate the development of reverse logistics networks that manage the flow of goods from their final destination back to the point of origin for purposes like recycling, and encourage businesses to establish recycling systems for key products such as batteries.

Enhancing international cooperation

Adhering to the principle of extensive consultations and joint contributions, China will leverage bilateral and multilateral cooperation mechanisms to deepen collaboration in green technologies, equipment, trade and standards.

The country will encourage competitive Chinese enterprises in photovoltaics, wind power, lithium batteries and new energy vehicles to expand globally and to invest in and develop green energy projects in countries and regions involved in the Belt and Road Initiative and beyond, while promoting green infrastructure and transportation solutions. China will also actively participate in shaping international green and low-carbon regulations and strengthen its capacity to implement international conventions.

An ancient Chinese proverb reads: ""Those who persevere in action will achieve their goals; those who steadfastly journey will reach their destination,"" which echoes the universal spirit of the Western adage: ""Actions speak louder than words.""

History rewards those who take concrete actions. No matter how the international landscape shifts, ""Made in China"" remains committed to honoring its pledge of building a community with a shared future for mankind through tangible green initiatives. China will champion the exchange of green technologies, promote the global alignment of green standards, facilitate the supply of green products and share opportunities in the green market. By forming the world's greatest joint force for green development, the country can collectively advance toward a future that is greener, more inclusive and sustainable.

The Permian Basin has become an essential destination for the US energy market, with operations being developed by several of the world’s top energy companies. Now, Brazos Midstream has commissioned a new $185 million gas processing facility in the Permian, close to Martin County. Despite calls to diversify the global energy market, Texas is standing firm and fostering investments in the American energy market.

Texas offers substantial tax incentives for any energy operators planning to enter the market

For any energy company planning new projects, deciding where to establish operations can be challenging; however, some regions in the world and states in the US offer significant tax incentives to attract potential operators. Texas is one such state and has recently granted the Sundance II project the tax incentive it has been searching for.

Brazos Midstream’s Sundance II project has been selected by the state of Texas to receive substantial tax benefits. The Sundance II gas processing facility is a 300-MMcf/d natural gas processing plant in Martin County and has the potential to boost the region’s gas processing power. The project qualified under the state’s Texas Jobs, Energy, Technology, and Innovation (JETI) program.

The company has noted its expectation is for the Sundance II project to create $185 million in capital investment, marking the continued reliance on the energy potential of the Permian basin in the American energy market, as noted by the state’s Governor.

“Texas energy fuels the American economy. New investment in natural gas processing is essential to meet increasing energy demands. Working with innovative industry leaders, we will continue to power growth across critical sectors for a stronger, more prosperous Texas.” – Texas Governor Greg Abbott

Brazos Midstream’s presence in the Permian basin has been a boost to the local energy market

Brazos boasts one of the largest privately held natural gas midstream networks in the Permian, and through its planned Sundance II gas processing facility, is aiming to increase its standing in the American energy market. Once complete, the Sundance II project will increase the company’s Midland Basin processing capacity to 500 MMcf/d.

The aforementioned JETI designation means that Brazos will enter a 10-year school district and maintenance and operations tax appraised value limitation, with the aim of returning the favor by creating new employment for locals. Along with the state of Texas, the energy firm has partnered with the Stanton Independent School District, which is located in Martin County.

“With support from the state through incentive structures such as the JETI program, Brazos Midstream hopes to further leverage its existing large-scale energy infrastructure by building gas processing facilities located in Texas to drive additional job creation and economic growth.” – Brazos Midstream CEO Brad Iles

The new project comes as Japan has agreed with the United States to finalize $550 billion investment framework that will boost the US’s energy infrastructure tremendously over the coming years.

The US infrastructure market is enjoying a surge of interest, with more firms seeking access largely due to the country’s strong artificial intelligence position. The North American economic giant is home to many of the early leaders in the space, as well as heavy government backing for the technology.

Of course, developing and maintaining a competitive edge is not easy. But some of the more established firms are benefiting from tried and tested approaches. 3i, which just celebrated its 80th anniversary, is one such firm. Rob Collins, managing partner for 3i North American Infrastructure Partners, explores what makes the US such an attractive market, as well as which opportunities stand out strongest.

How would you characterise the current investment landscape for infrastructure in the US?

Generally speaking, since the pandemic, US infrastructure has become a more expensive market to invest in. There are a lot more fishermen in the pond, so to speak, and this is driving up prices.

The opportunity set we most prefer is found in the mid-market, which is a less competitive space than the mega-market. We focus our efforts on identifying under-the-radar infrastructure opportunities that we can support or put in place high-quality management teams to execute on our investment thesis. 3i has been investing in the mid-market since 1945, and has built up a longstanding track record over that period.

Which sectors are attracting the most attention?

Clearly, digital infrastructure has gained the most attention since the pandemic. This has been most prominent across fibre broadband providers and most recently data centre developers, resulting in higher valuations across the board.

We believe that digital infrastructure is attractive and have invested through differentiated strategies such as backing an experienced team to build cell towers or being very selective in the fibre markets we want to go after. While traditional data centre development is less attractive to us, we are exploring adjacent industries such as power generation and other services that will benefit from the same industry tailwinds.

In addition to digital, we’re focused on three additional sectors right now: transportation, environmental services and social infrastructure. Some of our peers will define social infrastructure assets differently, so it’s worth clarifying that we have a wide-span aperture to this area. Our ambition to invest in social infrastructure has led us towards businesses related to food and agriculture production or leasing of equipment, which support other essential services.

How important is sustainability to investment decisions?

ESG is an important part of our process and something we, as a firm, have taken seriously for a long time. In 2008, 3i acquired SLR Consulting, the largest ESG consulting firm in Europe. We held on to the investment in SLR for a decade, which helped us firmly embed ESG criteria in our investment committee processes over almost the last 20 years.

The way in which we champion ESG considerations in our investments is evident in several of our holdings, such as EC Waste. This is the largest vertically integrated provider of solid-waste services in Puerto Rico. The company is also the only provider of 100 percent US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) compliant, regulated and permitted waste disposal on the island.

With our help, EC Waste has made significant investments in its infrastructure and operations technology through sustainable waste practices and continuing to exceed US EPA compliance. Doing so has had a meaningful impact on improving drinking-water quality in Puerto Rico.

This is also important work because the main competition for EC Waste is illegal solid-waste disposal that’s unregulated and can severely contaminate the groundwater through toxic leachate without properly regulated EPA landfill permits. Our work, and consideration of ESG criteria in our investment decisions, is continuing to enhance the quality of drinking water in Puerto Rico, while growing the investment performance of the company.

What are the biggest challenges investors face in the US market?

In terms of finding businesses that perform an essential service, and that have sustainable barriers to entry with demonstrated and durable cashflows, we have a wide lens on identifying such opportunities. The challenge is finding businesses that meet those criteria and are also recession resistant.

An example I would give is Smarte Carte, which is our airport-concession business. For over 50 years, this business has been a key player in North American logistics, providing customers with products like luggage solutions and secure storage in over 300 airports and other locations globally (including 97 of the top 100 airports in the US). In 2017, we invested in Smarte Carte after identifying the company as having the same revenue risk as owning a stake in an airport.

The pandemic demonstrated the most severe downside case of any underwriting model and temporarily paralysed air travel. However, we were pleased to see Smarte Carte not just survive covid but really thrive throughout that period and beyond. Now, international airlines have increased flights, seat capacity, pilot training and new-plane purchases.

As evidence of core-risk infrastructure, Smarte Carte was designated by the US Treasury Department as an essential-service company, and the only business selected in the US aviation-value chain that wasn’t an airport or airline. The company was able to overcome the challenges of that severe economic downturn through optimising pricing and managing costs.

Since then, we’ve worked with Smarte Carte to expand its operations to more locations and geographies. This was while helping introduce the business to the infrastructure-lending market (for the first time in its history) and raising several successful rounds of financing on attractive terms.

How can managers differentiate themselves when investing?

Since we were founded in 1945 to help reconstruct the UK after World War II, 3i has been building businesses. In fact, our 3i name stands for Investors In Industry. From the beginning, we’ve invested in infrastructure by identifying best-in-class management teams and partnering with them to realise the full potential of each investment. We also have decades of value-add private equity experience that we leverage throughout our infrastructure underwriting and asset management processes.

We’re also differentiated thanks to our global network of operating partners, which we call our Business Leaders Network (BLN). We’ve been cultivating this network for the last 40 years and actively leverage these relationships to bring industry-leading expertise to our holdings when they need it.

For another example during the pandemic, with Smarte Carte we really relied on a 3i BLN operating partner we put on the company board – Greg Hart, retired COO at United Airlines – to help us navigate that challenging time for the aviation industry.

Going into the pandemic we were prepared, much like the major US airports were, for a complete 90-day domestic airport shutdown. This involved taking a fresh look at expense management and putting in place availability payments with airport partners to help the company perform during that economic downturn.

How do you see opportunities evolving?

Looking ahead, we’re seeking businesses in the US that fit our criteria and play into the AI revolution. Whether that’s power generation or providing support services to operating data centres, we’re finding businesses connected to AI’s growth story. This is similar to the way Smarte Carte gave us great exposure to the aviation value chain, with the same revenue risk of owning an entire airport.

The AI investment theme is deservedly getting a huge amount of attention and disruption concern. But I see this disruptive technology as more exciting than challenging to infrastructure investing. Ironically, we can use AI itself to identify AI infrastructure businesses. This is making for a really exciting time. AI will be transformational and disruptive in virtually every industry, and infrastructure perhaps has the most to benefit.

How are geopolitical events and domestic politics impacting US infrastructure investing?

There’s a lot of dynamic change right now with respect to global geopolitical events and US politics specifically, which naturally provides challenges and opportunities.

Encouragingly, though, most domestic US infrastructure investments still enjoy broad and very consistent bipartisan support. Regional Rail is an example of this. The company is a short-line rail platform that we acquired in 2019. Regional Rail has been running since 2007 and provides freight transportation, car storage and transloading services across the US and Western Canada, spanning over 875 miles of track.

Covid hit less than a year after we first invested in Regional Rail. Fortunately, both Republican and Democratic states continued to provide grants for rail expansion, as this mode of transport played a critical role in getting the economy back up and running. And since our initial investment in three railroads, we’ve supported Regional Rail in acquiring 14 additional railroads, further strengthening and expanding its presence in the US and Canada.

The pandemic also greatly expanded the definition of core-risk infrastructure, and such investments were thoroughly tested throughout the economic downturn. However, one of the benefits of that two-year period was it really helped us further identify downside risk in our investments, making them even more recession resistant.",https://media.infrastructureinvestor.com/uploads/2025/11/P87.jpg,N,,2025-11-30 21:58:55.445603

Collaboration, from customizing workforce training to preparing shovel-ready sites, has nourished North Carolina’s life-sciences industry for more than 40 years. New programs ensure that support will continue into the future.

Fujifilm Biosciences opened one of North America’s largest commercial-scale cell culture factories in September. The more than $3 billion investment measures 1 million square feet and will employ 750 people by year’s end. It’s expected to add 300,000 square feet when it reaches capacity in 2028 and employ 1,400 by 2031. “North Carolina is creating the future of biotech, and Fujifilm is an industry leader,” Gov. Josh Stein said at the ribbon cutting. “This overall project will grow our state’s economy by $4.7 billion over the next decade.”

Growth was a pillar of Research Triangle Park’s master plan in 1984, when state leaders began investing in the state’s future economy. Traditional manufacturing — tobacco products, textiles and furniture — was declining. “North Carolina’s leaders realized that genetic engineering and other new technologies from bioscience research labs had enormous potential,” says Mark Phillips, N.C. Biotechnology Center vice president of statewide operations and executive director of its eastern regional office in Greenville. “They also knew that technology could transform some of North Carolina’s largest industries, notably agriculture and medicine.”

Fujifilm is the latest in a steady stream of life-sciences companies that have invested in North Carolina. More than 840 of these companies do business here and employ 75,000 people, according to N.C. Biotechnology Center. Include the 2,500 businesses that support this industry, and employment swells to 225,000 statewide. Growing the industry, which made more than $10 billion in investments last year alone, is a community effort.

North Carolina’s biomanufacturing corridor stretches from Winston-Salem’s Innovation Quarter, which is home to more than 90 companies and 3,600 employees, to the BioPharma Cresent, which arcs through Edgecombe, Johnston, Nash, Pitt and Wilson counties. The latter has been called one of the East Coast’s largest biopharma manufacturing concentrations.

It employs more than 10,000 people and continues to grow. Six projects, representing more than $6.2 billion in investments, were announced last year.

Scott Ralls is president of Wake Technical Community College. It’s his latest post in a career with the N.C. Community College System that stretches nearly three decades. He has watched the biotechnology industry grow during that time, and he says its recent spurt is the culmination of years of hard work and investment. Those efforts have built a business-friendly environment that’s filled with shovel-ready sites, a falling corporate tax, and rail, road and air connections to consumers around the world. And there’s plenty of mechanics in place to ensure companies have the workforce they need to succeed.

Wake Tech serves about 75,000 students across its eight campuses. “One of the things the community colleges and universities attempt to do is to keep scaling to support our new and existing industries,” Ralls says. “Today, we have four times the number of students in biotechnology programs than we did four years ago and a myriad programs we didn’t

have before.”

Ralls and his team train, upskill and reskill workers. That’s done through traditional courses and training tuned to each company’s exact needs. The college partnered with CSL Seqirus, Fujifilm and Eli Lilly, for example, to create the country’s first eight-month program for training advanced maintenance technicians. And it collaborates with Amgen to provide training programs for its recent $1.5 billion investment in Holly Springs. Amgen also sponsors a co-laboratory at Wake Tech’s RTP campus, where technologists and industry professionals collaborate on innovations.

The community college system’s customized workforce training is available to existing businesses, too, and it’s often offered before the first dirt is turned for new locations and expansions. “We actually get involved with proposals when companies begin making the decisions about when to locate here,” Ralls says. NCEdge, for example, develops training solutions that address the participating company’s immediate challenges and prepare it for the future.

Collaborations between companies and colleges are becoming more common. “We have established a brand-new Lilly Center for Science and Technology, and next August we’re opening Fujifilm Hall on our new campus in Apex,” Ralls says. “Our biopharma partners work with us on apprenticeship programs, and that wasn’t happening four years ago.”

Partnerships across the 58-college system increase capacity. Wake Tech and Durham Technical Community College launched RTP Bio. It unifies the talent pipeline for the industry. “We have this notion that our economic development partners are part of an ecosystem,” Ralls says. “But to me, it is really a community. I’m very close with my colleagues at other community colleges, NC State University and our industry partners, and it feels like we’re all building it together.”",https://images.businessnc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/LifeSciences_main_image_web.jpg,N,,2025-11-30 21:59:14.485469

The Terrapins are using chitin, the chemical that makes crustacean casings hard, to form a biodegradable electrolyte, according to an Instagram post from the World Economic Forum. By using it in a battery, the experts may have created a circularly produced power pack for electric vehicles and other tech.

""Now we can 'eat ze water bugs' and use their skeletal remains for energy!"" one charismatic viewer commented.

And, they aren't far off the mark. Research from the Chemical Engineering Journal, published in ScienceDirect, reported that up to 8.8 million tons of shrimp, lobster, and crab shell waste are made each year. Much of it comes from the restaurant industry.

The Maryland team can turn recycled chitin from those shells into a degradable electrolyte, one of the key components of a battery. Adding zinc enables chemistry that astoundingly maintains 99.7% of its capacity after 400 charge/discharge cycles, according to the post.

If successfully scaled, the innovation could limit invasive mining for lithium and other hard-to-gather and costly materials in common packs.

For its part, chitin is abundant. The University of Connecticut reported that 100 billion tons of the biological polymer are naturally made each year. Researchers elsewhere are experimenting with it as the base for plastic-free products.

The Instagram post shows phones, drones, and EVs as everyday products that could be powered by the shell-based packs.

What's more, the battery can be broken down by microbes in less than half a year, compared to the hundreds of years it can take common lithium-ion components to degrade, per the World Economic Forum. And, zinc from the shell packs can be reclaimed and used again for the same purpose.

Some commenters took issue with harvesting crustaceans as part of the process.

""How is [it] sustainable to kill millions of crabs [for] batteries? This is insane!"" a viewer wrote.

But the World Wildlife Fund reported that three billion people rely on seafood as a protein, so shell waste is likely inevitable. Putting it to use keeps it from contributing to methane-producing landfill trash that adds to our planet's warming. Most of the world's excess heat is trapped in the ocean, harming sea life, according to the National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration. So, the impact of cleaner batteries could benefit future shellfish if scaled.

One of the best ways to help limit heat-trapping air pollution is to add home solar to your electricity plan. Solar panels with a battery backup can help you reduce or eliminate your electricity costs while ensuring your lights stay on during outages.

The Cool Down's Solar Explorer can match you with trusted partners that will compare quotes, find an installer, and help you secure tax breaks that expire on Dec. 31, saving up to $10,000 in upfront costs.

The International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT) notes that in the first three quarters of 2025, sales have skyrocketed — with 1.2 million EVs sold — more than the entire previous year.
The increase in sales is largely due to automakers making their EVs more affordable and expanding electrification across new models.
In 2015, only 25 EV models existed, compared with 113 in 2025.

The International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT) notes that in the first three quarters of 2025, sales have skyrocketed — with 1.2 million EVs sold — more than the entire previous year.

The increase in sales is largely due to automakers making their EVs more affordable and expanding electrification across new models. According to the ICCT, 68% of EVs are now priced at under $50,000. In 2015, only 25 EV models existed, compared with 113 in 2025.

The ICCT states that ""consumer appetite continues to grow,"" noting that recent surveys show a majority of respondents are interested in making an EV their next vehicle.

Still, many automakers are holding back from investing in EVs. The ICCT reports that companies are hesitating because of market uncertainty, rising costs, shifting regulations, and concerns about consumer demand.

A shift toward vehicle electrification benefits consumers by introducing new models at more affordable prices. EVs do not need gas and typically require less maintenance, which can significantly reduce ownership costs and customer dissatisfaction.

As EVs continue to outnumber combustion vehicles, prices are expected to keep dropping, making them a more affordable option. This may also encourage consumers to electrify their lifestyles further by looking into solar energy to power their homes and vehicles.

EVs are also a far more environmentally friendly option because they lack tailpipes that release dirty, polluting gases that contribute to the warming of our planet.

To further increase affordability, a startup, Ateios Systems, has come up with a process that coats electrodes for faster battery manufacturing. This allows batteries to be produced more quickly to ramp up EV production.

Corporations are also teaming up to strengthen the battery supply chain. Epsilon Advanced Materials and Phillips 66 are partnering to produce key graphite materials inside the U.S., rather than relying on foreign sources that are vulnerable to tariffs and export restrictions.

It is evident that automakers are working hard to reduce the cost of EVs. Jeremy Short, chief engineer for the GM Bolt, told Fast Company, ""We wanted to get that under-$30,000 number.""

Similarly, a spokesperson for Ford told CarsDirect that the 2026 Ford F-150 Lightning will see price cuts of up to $4,000, and CarsDirect adds the company ""is doing so without sacrificing standard equipment.""",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/hands.jpg,N,,2025-11-30 19:58:40.784755

In a rare instance of bipartisan alarm, Republican-chaired committees in the House and Senate announced that they have launched inquiries into an explosive Washington Post report alleging Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth had given a spoken order to “kill everybody” aboard a vessel carrying suspected drug traffickers in the Caribbean. The occupants included two people who had survived an initial missile strike on the vessel and were seen “clinging” to the wreckage.

“We take seriously the reports of follow-on strikes on boats alleged to be ferrying narcotics in the SOUTHCOM region and are taking bipartisan action to gather a full accounting of the operation in question,” the leaders of the House Armed Services Committee said in a joint statement on Friday.

“The Committee has directed inquiries to the [Department of Defense], and we will be conducting vigorous oversight to determine the facts related to these circumstances,” leaders in the Senate Armed Services Committee said.

The September 2 attack kicked off what has now been nearly two dozen attacks, killing at least 83 people, who the US military claims, without evidence, had been attempting to smuggle drugs into the US. The attacks, which President Trump justifies as a part of an “armed conflict” with drug cartels, have been likened to extrajudicial killings.

Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona told CNN on Sunday that Hegseth’s actions, as reported by the Post, appear to be a war crime.

“If what has been reported is accurate, I’ve got serious concerns about anybody in that chain of command stepping over a line that they should never step over,” Kelly said. “We are not Russia. We are not Iraq. We hold ourselves to a very high standard of professionalism.”

Kelly is locked in a related battle of words with Hegseth after Kelly participated in a social media video with five other Democrats seeking to remind members of the military that they can “refuse illegal orders.”

Hegseth has blasted the Post’s reporting on the missile strikes as “fabricated.”",https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/hegseth.jpg?w=1200&h=630&crop=1,N,,2025-11-30 20:59:16.019935

Employers will continue to receive $5,000 for engaging apprentices in KAP priority occupations for another year, while apprentices will continue to receive $10,000.
This support will be shared equally - with $2,500 for the apprentice and $2,500 for the employer.
""Changes to the incentive system have been carefully calibrated to target support towards housing and new energy occupations, ensuring a skills pipeline in these nation-building industries.
""Alongside our other supports for apprentices, including Free TAFE and Australian Apprenticeship Support Loans, these incentives support a continued strong pipeline of skilled workers in the areas they are most needed, like housing and new energy.""","The Albanese Labor Government is extending its $5,000 financial incentive for employers who engage apprentices in the Key Apprenticeship Program (KAP) sectors of housing and new energy.

The decision to extend the payments to December 2026 follows strong uptake of the KAP since it commenced on 1 July this year.

KAP, an expansion of the successful New Energy Apprenticeship Program (NEAP), has seen more than 6,600 apprentices commencing under the housing construction stream, while more than 15,400 new energy apprentices have started training under the NEAP and KAP.

Employers will continue to receive $5,000 for engaging apprentices in KAP priority occupations for another year, while apprentices will continue to receive $10,000.

The changes to the incentive payments follow recommendations from the Strategic Review of the Incentive System and support the Albanese Government's broader plan to meet net zero targets and to build 1.2 million homes by 2029.

From 1 January next year, new apprenticeships in priority occupations that are not eligible for KAP funding will receive incentive payments of $5,000 per apprenticeship. This support will be shared equally - with $2,500 for the apprentice and $2,500 for the employer.

Incentive payments for apprenticeships that commence prior to 1 January 2026 won't be affected by these changes.

This payment is among a suite of government support measures for apprentices, including:

Australian Apprenticeship Support Loans of up to $25,983 (2025-26) to help with the costs of undertaking an apprenticeship in priority occupations

The Living Away From Home Allowance to help those who need to move away from home to take up an apprenticeship opportunity.

Other supports available for apprenticeships include the Apprentice Connect Australia Providers for advice and assistance accessing services, Free TAFE and the Building Women's Careers Program.

The Australian Skills Guarantee Procurement Connected Policy is also creating more employment opportunities for apprentices and trainees by including national targets for apprentices as a requirement for Commonwealth infrastructure and ICT projects.

Quotes attributable to Minister for Skills and Training, Andrew Giles:

""The Albanese Government recognises that employers play a key role in getting more apprentices into critical housing construction and clean energy jobs. This includes carpenters and joiners, plumbers and electricians.

""Changes to the incentive system have been carefully calibrated to target support towards housing and new energy occupations, ensuring a skills pipeline in these nation-building industries.

""The Government continues to provide a range of supports for apprentices because we acknowledge the importance of growing a skills-based workforce ready for the future.""

Quotes attributable to Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Amanda Rishworth:

""The Albanese Government is supporting apprentices in priority occupations who are literally building Australia's future.

""Alongside our other supports for apprentices, including Free TAFE and Australian Apprenticeship Support Loans, these incentives support a continued strong pipeline of skilled workers in the areas they are most needed, like housing and new energy.""",https://cdn1.miragenews.com/tmp_cache?cdn=cdn.pixabay.com%2Fphoto%2F2017%2F05%2F31%2F11%2F17%2Foffice-2360063_1280.jpg,N,,2025-11-30 21:58:50.286847

ROBERTS III, Staff columnist, www.facebook.com",,,,,https://www.theadvocate.com/baton_rouge/opinion/faimon-roberts-carbon-capture-opponents-wont-go-away-and-it-s-scrambling-conservative-politics/article_8a222ce6-150a-5a5b-bf2a-87f335dfc83e.html,"The carbon capture insurgency just won’t die.
Some conservatives say carbon capture is unneeded because climate change is overblown.
Earlier this year, it seemed that those who favored expansion of carbon capture had the upper hand.
Jeff Landry issued a moratorium on new carbon capture permits.
Not surprisingly, carbon capture boosters were not pleased.","The carbon capture insurgency just won’t die.

Last week, a group called Save My Louisiana filed a lawsuit in Baton Rouge, arguing that the process amounts to a “egregious and overt trampling” of property rights.

And on Nov. 17, the Vernon Parish Police Jury reversed an earlier decision and passed a resolution opposing the practice.

These latest salvos are an indication of how carbon capture has scrambled conservative and Republican Party politics in this state, because much of the opposition to the process comes not from left-wing environmental justice types (though many of them oppose it, too), but from rock-ribbed conservatives in some of the reddest regions of Louisiana.

To understand what is going on here, it’s important to know what exactly is being proposed. Carbon capture and sequestration is an industrial process by which CO2 and greenhouse gases produced as byproducts are captured and stored rather than released into the air.

Proponents, including industry and business groups, argue that this makes production greener by releasing less CO2. They also contend that the storage, which typically happens thousands of feet underground and is performed by something known as a carbon injection well, is safe, and that there is no danger of the CO2 leaching upward through the ground into water supplies or to the surface.

But the opponents, including many landowners, aren’t buying it.

They worry about the potential for pipeline failures, or that the carbon could find its way into local aquifers. Some conservatives say carbon capture is unneeded because climate change is overblown.

Many of those who oppose it are clustered in the central part of the state, where there are a number of proposed carbon storage areas.

Earlier this year, it seemed that those who favored expansion of carbon capture had the upper hand. Following a 2024 federal government decision that gave the state “primacy” in permitting carbon capture projects, the Legislature rejected Republican-authored bills that would have given local governments the right to veto injection wells, though lawmakers did tighten some rules in landowners’ favor.

But the opposition wouldn’t go away. Last month, in response, Gov. Jeff Landry issued a moratorium on new carbon capture permits. A handful already in the process were not affected.

""Local government and citizens, through their local government, have a right to be heard to ensure safety, transparency, and local input,"" Landry wrote in his order.

Not surprisingly, carbon capture boosters were not pleased.

The move sends the “wrong message,” said David Cresson, of the Louisiana Chemical Association. Others warned of “obstacles” the state was putting in the way of expansion.

So what we have here is a pitched fight between, essentially, two different conservative constituencies who are both dug in.

On the one hand, you have business, industry and economic development types who see the potential for growth.

On the other, citizens and officials in many of Louisiana’s reddest parishes who, in a notable development, echo many of the concerns that environmentalists have uttered for years — and also assert traditional conservative values like property rights and local control.

It’s too early to see how it will all play out. But if this oil and gas state ever turns on its biggest and most powerful industry, analysts may point to carbon capture as the spark that ignited the flame.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/theadvocate.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/8/a2/8a222ce6-150a-5a5b-bf2a-87f335dfc83e/6927760dadc22.preview.jpg?crop=1662%2C873%2C0%2C187&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-12-01 02:59:43.286652

“Coal-fired power plants nearly destroyed the Adirondack Park’s forests, lakes and ponds with acid rain,” Adirondack Council Clean Air Specialist and Director of Communications John F. Sheehan said in a press release. “Things are starting to get better here after 30 years of pollution reductions. We don’t want to undo this win and once again lose trees and fish.

“The 2024 soot standards were 25% better at protecting public health than the old standard, which now goes back into effect. Rolling back National Ambient Air Quality Standards undermines public health and safety and will have lasting economic impacts for the country. The nation saves $20 in public health costs for every dollar spent cutting air pollution such as soot, ozone and sulfur dioxide.”

The Adirondack Park contains one of the largest, intact temperate forests in the world and is home to approximately 130,000 year-round residents.

The executive order, issued Nov. 21, said steel makers would be exempt from former President Joe Biden-era standards designed to prevent future pollution increases at all coal-fired smokestacks. All of the steel plants exempt were already meeting the new standards.

This past week, the EPA filed a motion in the U.S. District Court saying it doesn’t intend to enforce the updated national soot standards.

Members of the Student Action Committee of the NJ Chapter of the Sierra Club recently launched a thrift store at Princeton Farmer’s Market at Hinds Plaza to raise funds for the Club’s Political Action Committee (PAC), in support of Mikie Sherill’s successful bid to become governor of New Jersey.

Our action tells two stories: one of polyester and other nondegradable materials saved from the landfill, and another of students choosing to support a political election.

The funds were raised the sustainable way: through recycling. Friends, families, and neighbors across the state rallied behind us by donating gently worn clothing, spreading word of our mission, and providing a community level market with the potential to thrive. Clothing items were priced from $3–$15, and Princeton community members and beyond excitedly shopped at our thrift shop, turning closets into catalysts for change! Our goal was not only to support a PAC but also to protect the planet.

Why Thrifting?

In recent years, fast fashion—often unsustainable and polluting—has led to large amounts of clothing being discarded. Much of it could have been reused or recycled. The fast-fashion trend has encouraged people to purchase more clothing than is truly needed. This clothing is often cheaply made, worn just a few times, and then thrown away. This cycle harms the environment in ways that may not always be obvious.

According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), in 2018 around 11.3 million tons of clothing, footwear, and linens were sent to landfills in the United States, and about 85% of all textiles were landfilled or incinerated. That’s a lot of waste.

According to the United Nations Environment Programme and allied sources, the fashion and textile industry is one of the world’s largest consumers of water (often cited as second only to agriculture) and is responsible for roughly 8% to 10% of global greenhouse‑gas emissions.

The materials in many of these clothes are also harmful. For example, polyester releases tiny plastic particles when washed. These end up in rivers, oceans, and even the food chain. It is estimated that washing synthetic clothes releases up to 500,000 tons of microfibers into the ocean each year, roughly equivalent to billions of plastic bottles.

Even donated clothes may end up in landfills. A more effective solution is buying secondhand clothes, known as thrifting. Thrifting lessens the environmental impact and supports local shops and charities that depend on donations. Another option is recycling or upcycling old clothes by turning them into something new instead of discarding them.

If more people bought secondhand items, repaired their clothing, or donated responsibly, less clothing would end up in landfills, and fewer harmful chemicals would pollute the environment.

Places We Can Sustainably Shop

Frequently recommended thrift stores in New Jersey include myUnique, on 2nd Street in Westfield, and Gift To Earth, at 712 Clinton Ave. in South Plainfield. Shoppers also prefer Goodwill for a more classic thrifting experience. It has many locations.

Places to Donate Clothes

Goodwill locations in New Jersey accept clothing donations, and unsold items at their stores are in turn donated to other organizations. Donating to local thrift stores and churches can ensure that donated clothing is distributed to people who live near you. Some other organizations that take clothing donations are Salvation Army and Planet Aid

Global Efforts

Some solutions to textile waste focus on turning discarded clothes into useful new products and materials. Fiber materials are taken from used garments and repurposed into new textiles, cleaning cloths, and construction materials. Mechanical textile recycling has been practiced for over 250 years. This involves physically separating fabrics and fibers for reuse. However, this often results in low-quality materials.

A more recent option is chemical recycling, which breaks down fabric into polymer building materials, although the downsides of this are concerning, such as energy use, emissions, and chemical pollution. There are also biotech solutions being explored at MIT that involve developing proteins to break down the polymers in fabrics so textiles can decompose in as little as two weeks.

Policy-based solutions in the United States, such as California’s Responsible Textile Recovery Act of 2024 (SB 707), are being implemented. This is an extended producer responsibility (EPR) law designed to hold fashion brands accountable for the entire lifecycle of their products, including waste management.

New York and Washington also are proposing EPR bills. Moreover, clothing companies such as Patagonia and H&M encourage consumers to trade in used clothes for credit.

What More Can We Do?

Fast fashion is harming our planet, but small, intentional choices are our building blocks for sustainable consumption.

Supporting local thrift stores reduces waste while strengthening our communities. Spreading awareness and educating those around us can also make a large difference. If we make responsible clothing choices, we can mitigate fast fashion’s impact and promote a cleaner, more sustainable future.",https://www.sierraclub.org/sites/default/themes/custom/bootpt/favicon.ico,N,,2025-11-30 19:59:19.645675

He said a Maine law that requires voter approval of any effort to restore nuclear power here should be changed.
Money spent on nuclear power in Maine wouldn’t stay here, Lawrence said, unlike local, renewable energy development such as offshore wind.","As the Trump administration works to dismantle renewable energy initiatives and boost oil, coal and natural gas, states such as Maine with aggressive climate initiatives will be largely on their own to maintain momentum. Or maybe shift gears.

That’s why the makeup of the Maine Legislature and the occupant of the governor’s office after the 2026 election cycle will be so consequential.

While the 132nd Legislature will reconvene in January and the who’s who of 2027 is unknowable now, the key issues lawmakers will face were foreshadowed earlier this month during a panel discussion at the Maine State Chamber of Commerce’s Energy Summit in Portland.

One takeaway is that energy affordability — under mounting stress chiefly from rising electricity prices — will be a litmus test for most any climate policy or spending decisions. That puts pressure on Democrats specifically. They have controlled both the Legislature and the executive branch since 2019, and have thus set Maine’s energy agenda, embodied in the state’s climate action plan.

Another takeaway is that, although Democratic and Republican legislators have different visions of how to make energy more affordable, they seem to have retained the rapport necessary for dialogue, a value largely gone from Washington in the Trump era.

The policy outlook panel hosted by the chamber featured four lawmakers with deep institutional knowledge, gained from their years on the Energy, Utilities and Technology Committee: Sen. Mark Lawrence, D-York, the Senate co-chair; Rep. Melanie Sachs, D-Freeport, the House co-chair; Rep. Steve Foster, R-Dexter, ranking committee member; and Sen. Matt Harrington R-York, the assistant Senate Republican leader.

Solar policy has been among the most divisive issues handled by the committee. Maine has wrestled in recent years to adjust financial incentives, championed by Democrats, that unleashed a wave of solar development but proved too generous and created a multi-million-dollar burden for electric customers. A recent law, L.D. 1777, restructured the incentives and set the stage for designing a successor program.

During the panel discussion, Sachs and Lawrence expressed satisfaction with the reforms, with Lawrence saying solar policy is now “in the rearview mirror.” But Harrington and Foster disagreed, saying the changes didn’t go far enough. Whether solar stays in the rearview mirror will depend on whether Democrats remain in the driver’s seat, or if a suit filed this week by the solar industry to block the law gets traction.

On the challenge of balancing affordability with clean energy goals, Sachs said Maine can do both. And Lawrence suggested Maine can expand its renewable energy sectors to export more power and boost economic growth. But their Republican colleagues see it differently.

Referring to a large wind farm in Bingham, near his district, Foster noted it was built to satisfy out-of-state contracts and didn’t directly benefit Maine electric customers. More pointedly, Harrington questioned the entire premise of building clean energy projects to meet “our climate goals.”

Harrington continued: “I do not share in those goals. The last six years in the Maine Legislature, the only focus has been on ‘their climate goals.’ There has been zero emphasis on affordability. And Maine people are feeling that so badly today.”

One step that could reduce electricity prices is lowering the wholesale cost of natural gas, which is used to generate half of New England’s electricity. The region doesn’t have enough pipeline capacity on the coldest days, and building new pipelines into southern New England could help lower costs and reduce price volatility. Public and political opposition in New York and Massachusetts, however, has kept more gas from coming north. That’s the primary reason most Maine electric customers will see their electricity supply rates rise next year.

Lamenting that, Foster spoke at length about the financial and climate emission benefits that natural gas brought to Maine paper mills after they converted from oil. He noted the political opposition occurring out of state, but offered no suggestion of how the Maine Legislature could influence it.

There’s a global effort to design small, less-expensive nuclear reactors that can be built in factories and assembled on site, although none yet exist in North America. Asked by the panel’s moderator to comment on the potential role of next-generation nuclear power, Harrington said it should be part of the energy conversation in Maine. He said a Maine law that requires voter approval of any effort to restore nuclear power here should be changed.

Lawrence, who along with Sachs had recently visited Ontario to learn about Canadian plans to build small modular reactors, said he wasn’t opposed to nuclear power. But the effort in Ontario is heavily subsidized by the government, he said, with job opportunities related to uranium mining, research and construction taking place in Canada.

Money spent on nuclear power in Maine wouldn’t stay here, Lawrence said, unlike local, renewable energy development such as offshore wind. He called nuclear power “an economic loser for the state of Maine.”

The panelists were asked to identify priorities for the upcoming legislative session. No surprise, the top issue was affordability. Harrington said affordability should be the only standard to work under, as opposed to the clean electricity standard now in state law that calls for greater shares of renewable power.

One hopeful sign that Maine lawmakers can work across party lines on affordability came in a closing remark from Lawrence, reflecting on his seven years working with Foster. It spoke to mutual respect, at a time when some lawmakers vilify their political opponents as personal adversaries.

“He’s very much a conscience,” Lawrence said of his Republican colleague, “when we Democrats are doing something too fast, too ambitious.”",https://w2pcms.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2025/04/AP19218765527962.jpg?w=780,N,,2025-11-30 16:59:12.074505

Conclusion CMS’ long-awaited announcement of maximum fair prices for covered drugs in the Medicare Drug Negotiation Program closes one of the largest outstanding items on its 2025 regulatory agenda.
The accompanying data, however, does not provide clear evidence of the benefits of the IRA Medicare drug negotiation program.","Executive Summary

The Trump Administration has published the maximum fair prices for covered drugs in the Medicare Drug Negotiation Program for initial price applicability year 2027; these 15 drugs in Part D were selected because of either high program spending or high beneficiary utilization.

The administration’s touted $12 billion in savings (an approximately 44-percent reduction in net Part D spending if the prices had been in place for 2024) are nearly double the initial year of savings under the Medicare Drug Negotiation Program.

While the savings seem significant, further analysis of the announcement identifies calculated inefficiencies, an overrepresentation of benefit, and the continued lack of evidence that any savings will truly materialize in Part D.

Introduction

On November 25, 2025, the Trump Administration announced the latest round of negotiated drugs under the Medicare Drug Negotiation Program established under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). The initial price applicability year (IPAY) 2027 announcement marks the second major wave of Medicare drug price negotiations, extending negotiated “maximum fair prices” (MFPs) to 15 high-spend or high-utilization Part D drugs starting January 1, 2027. These drugs accounted for roughly $42.5 billion in gross Part D spending in 2024 – about 15 percent of total program drug costs – and were used by about 5.3 million beneficiaries. The administration touted savings of $12 billion in net covered prescription drug costs, or approximately 44 percent lower aggregate net spending, if the MFPs had been in effect for 2024. For 2027, the administration estimated that people enrolled in Medicare prescription drug coverage would save $685 million in out-of-pocket costs under the MFPs. While seemingly impressive, these aggregated, theoretical savings based on retrospective data continue to tell only one aspect of the entire Medicare landscape.

CMS IPAY 2027 Announcement

Under the Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) directly negotiates prices for high-expenditure, single-source Part D drugs lacking generic or biosimilar competition. For IPAY 2027, CMS finalized MFPs for 15 selected Part D drugs after a year-long negotiation process with manufacturers. The table below, from the CMS fact sheet announcing the MFPs, demonstrates the range of projected savings.

Headline Savings and Comparison to IPAY 2026

CMS’ 2027 estimates show larger aggregate savings in both absolute and percentage terms: $12 billion in net savings (44-percent reduction) excluding the coverage gap discount program (CGDP), and about $8.5 billion (36 percent) when CGDP is incorporated. Under the CGDP – or the Manufacturers Discount Program as it is now called – participating manufacturers are required to provide discounts on applicable drugs in the initial and catastrophic coverage phases of Part D. In other words, a wide-reaching discount program already resulting in beneficiary savings without the IRA MFPs. On the beneficiary side, CMS projects that, under the defined standard Part D benefit, enrollees could save an estimated $685 million in out-of-pocket costs in 2027 from these MFPs alone.

The IPAY 2027 figures are frequently contrasted with those from the first negotiation cycle, IPAY 2026, which involved 10 Part D drugs used for conditions such as diabetes, heart failure, autoimmune disease, and blood cancers. For the first round, CMS estimated that if the 2026 MFPs had applied in 2023, Medicare would have saved about $6 billion in net spending – roughly a 22 percent reduction – while beneficiaries were projected to save about $1.5 billion in out-of-pocket costs in 2026.

The second-year discounts are deeper on average than those in the first year, in part because the 2027 group includes very high-spend GLP-1s and oncology agents with substantial room between list prices and MFPs. Additionally, the absolute out-of-pocket gain to beneficiaries from MFPs alone is smaller than in 2026 because the broader Part D redesign (including the new out-of-pocket cap) is now doing much of the heavy lifting on catastrophic costs. The table below shows numerous calculations to demonstrate the “true” amount of the government-determined rebate. Note: t did not have sufficient data to assess average manufacturer rebates, and thus comparable numbers could not reliably be generated. Based on the calculations, some rebates may be impactful; others are clearly not huge sources of savings for either the government or beneficiaries.

Potential Implications for Beneficiaries

For individual Part D enrollees, the practical impact of these new MFPs will depend on benefit design, utilization, and interactions with other IRA changes.

Interaction with the Part D out-of-pocket cap: As of 2025, Part D enrollees face a $2,000 annual cap on out-of-pocket drug spending (rising to $2,100 in 2026), after which they owe no additional cost sharing for covered Part D drugs. For heavy users of high-cost products such as GLP-1s or oral oncology drugs, this cap may already substantially limit spending; the MFPs then reduce the amount of cost sharing they incur before hitting the cap and may mean fewer people hit the cap in the first place.

Coinsurance versus copay designs: Beneficiaries in plans that charge coinsurance (a percentage of the drug’s price) should see a direct reduction in per-fill costs when the MFPs take effect, assuming the MFP is below the plan’s current net price. Those facing flat copays may see little or no immediate change if the plan keeps the same copay amount, even though the plan’s own liability falls. The magnitude of out-of-pocket savings from negotiation is inherently uncertain and will vary by plan design and beneficiary utilization.

Formulary coverage and access: A key structural component is that Part D plans are required to cover all selected drugs with MFPs, including all dosage forms and strengths, which may reduce the risk that a beneficiary finds a high-profile drug excluded from their plan or subject to unusually restrictive utilization management compared to non-selected competitors. CMS has indicated it will scrutinize tiering and management practices that could undermine access to selected drugs.

Distribution of gains: Because the IPAY 2027 list includes several specialty and high-cost products, savings will be concentrated among beneficiaries who use these specific drugs rather than spread evenly across all Part D enrollees. At the same time, program-level savings can exert downward pressure on premiums and on federal Part D spending over time, potentially benefiting a broader population indirectly.

Points of Confusion and Contention

Aggressive “negotiations” to address beneficiary needs

Outside of the IRA negotiations, the White House had long been signaling that drug pricing would be handled aggressively, with a mix of Most-Favored-Nation (MFN) rhetoric and tariff brinkmanship. The message to manufacturers and foreign governments has been: Accept lower prices, or face some combination of trade penalties, import restrictions, or regulatory pressure. That’s not a traditional negotiation over value; it’s a leverage campaign.

The IRA’s negotiation authority is just the domestic counterpart to these external tactics. MFN talk toward other countries says, “we’ll make you pay if you don’t give us your lowest price.” The IRA framework says to manufacturers, “we’ll tax you out of the Medicare market if you don’t sign the MFP contract.” This approach doesn’t build a principled, predictable pricing framework; it levies the threat of punishment to drag prices down in discrete skirmishes.

As noted in POLITICO, Chris Klomp, the Director of Medicare, stated this clearly:

The key factor in the second round of price negotiations was the administration’s willingness to walk away from the table if they didn’t reach a deal, said Chris Klomp, deputy administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which handled the talks.

“A true negotiation implies that you might not reach a negotiated outcome,” Klomp said.

Thus, framing the IPAY 2026 and IPAY 2027 rounds as “negotiations” obscures what’s really going on. The same posture that underlies MFN posturing and pharmaceutical tariff threats –naming and shaming manufacturers and threatening punitive penalties for headline-ready percentage cuts – has simply been imported into Medicare. The millions of beneficiaries that CMS is arguably responsible for representing have no say in the determination of an acceptable price, so the central decision-making process can’t be called a negotiation. It creates a blurred line between legitimate purchasing strategy and ad hoc economic coercion, and it makes it hard to argue that the resulting prices are the product of a thoughtful, evidence-based process rather than the latest move in a high-stakes game of chicken.

Any “value” created is narrow

On paper, the IPAY 2027 MFPs deliver several billion dollars a year in lower Medicare spending on a carefully curated list of high-spend drugs. But those “savings” are calculated relative to a baseline that assumes the old system – escalating list prices and opaque rebates – would have continued unchanged. There is still no serious accounting for how manufacturers will respond when a significant share of their Medicare revenue is capped by statute: higher prices in commercial markets, trimmed investment in follow-on indications, different launch strategies, or more aggressive contracting outside Medicare. Those downstream effects are invisible in the headline savings figure, but they are very real economic costs.

For beneficiaries, the purported benefits are muddled. The projected out-of-pocket savings sound impressive in aggregate, but they are narrowly concentrated among people taking a small set of drugs and sit on top of a redesigned Part D that would have reduced catastrophic exposure anyway. A sizable share of the “benefit” claimed through MFPs is arguably just double-counting: The out-of-pocket cap and restructured liability phases are doing most of the heavy lifting, while MFPs marginally lower the prices that feed into that benefit formula.

The graph below shows that the comparative impact of these “negotiations” is less than the market itself could drive. Only four of the 15 selected drugs (the graph omits Pomalyst due to sparse data) have an IRA rebate that outperforms the market. This is more than last year’s MFPs – which had no IRA rebates that out-performed the market – but it is not a ringing endorsement of the program’s success.

The Ever-present Mismatch of GLP-1 policy

As if the GLP-1 coverage decision-making process wasn’t convoluted enough, the gap between the semaglutide MFP for IPAY 2027 and the earlier, highly publicized GLP-1 “deal” is a useful case study in how ad hoc this policy environment has become. The administration has announced two different prices for the same medication that is intended to be administered in the same program. We now have two competing reference points:

a statutory MFP for semaglutide inside Part D, produced by the IRA’s statutory process and meant to apply across plans; and

a program-specific GLP-1 price, marketed as a breakthrough “deal,” that in some cases lands below, and in other cases above, the semaglutide MFP – depending on channel, indication, and details of the arrangement.

CMS has already announced that the separately negotiated GLP-1 deal will supersede the IRA MFP outcomes, which could support a narrative that the Medicare drug negotiation program is not a rational, rules-based anchor for the market, but instead is a stopgap for the price-setting endeavors being led by the White House. It tells patients and plans that there is no single “true” price for these drugs; there are multiple, politically-negotiated prices depending on where you sit. The result looks less like a principled, evidence-based pricing regime and more like a layered set of one-off bargains.

Conclusion

CMS’ long-awaited announcement of maximum fair prices for covered drugs in the Medicare Drug Negotiation Program closes one of the largest outstanding items on its 2025 regulatory agenda. The accompanying data, however, does not provide clear evidence of the benefits of the IRA Medicare drug negotiation program. While the savings seem significant, further analysis of the announcement identifies calculated inefficiencies, an overrepresentation of benefit, and the continued lack of hard evidence that any savings will truly materialize in Part D. The health care industry still has not experienced a world in which any MFP has been effectuated for Part D, and until this is the case, the impact of any MFPs remains theoretical and unsubstantiated.",https://www.americanactionforum.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/MDNP-IPAY-2027.png,N,,2025-11-30 16:59:47.004501

Flagship BEV Taurus prime mover features innovative battery-swapping technology

Company to continue supporting hydrogen solutions with price reductions coming

At the company’s annual general meeting, shareholders voted strongly in favour of the name change which the company said reflects its expansion beyond hydrogen into a wider portfolio of clean energy technologies, mobility solutions and services.

While Pure One (proposed code: P1C) will continue to offer a strong line-up of hydrogen mobility products, its vehicle offering has also expanded into battery-electric solutions.

Importantly, this includes a battery-swap technology that is cheaper than diesel in both capex and maintenance.

This tech allows vehicle batteries to be quickly swapped out in minutes, which completely side-steps the biggest drawback of BEVs – namely the need for lengthy recharging times.

Highlighting this, the company is targeting a price point of $200,000 plus GST for its flagship Taurus battery-swap 6x4 prime mover – a highly competitive price point for a new prime mover in Australia.

The prime mover and the 8X4 rigid are both expected to be strong sellers as Pure One leverages its first-mover advantage as a leading supplier of clean energy vehicles for the commercial transport sector.

PH2 has also reiterated it will continue to support hydrogen solutions as input prices continue to decrease with improved product redesign and diversified supply channels.

To deliver on its market opportunity, Pure One is taking a strategic partnership approach – highlighted recently by a signed term sheet with Advanced Manufacturing Queensland for the supply, assembly and sale of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles in Australia.

Diverse, ADR compliant fleet

Operating as Pure one, the company will offer customers a diverse fleet of clean technology commercial vehicles that have been designed from the ground up.

It provides a pathway to near-term cashflow with proven technology and the company notes a strong demand pipeline for BEV buses as passenger transport.

The company’s prime mover – 23t waste truck and buses compliant with Australian Design Rules – meet national standards for road vehicle safety, anti-theft and emissions.

Multiple vehicles are being built to meet a growing sales pipeline comprising multi-vehicle orders from large Australian industrial and construction customers.

In August 2025, Pure One secured more than $3m in new orders from commercial transport operators for its leading fleet of hydrogen fuel cell (HFC) vehicles.

These include two Taurus HFC prime movers ordered by Scott Lovatt Transport – a NSW- based company in Preston, southwest of Sydney – and a follow-up purchase order from construction major Heidelberg Materials Australia for a second HFC 8×4 concrete agitator rigid truck.

California-based truck distributor and leasing operator GTS Group has also sent the company a letter of intent for the purchase of Class 8 HFC tractor units along with a range of rigid trucks including 6X4 waste collection and 8X4 concrete mixer vehicles for its leasing customers.

The company has also been growing its exposure with agreements in place.

To meet these and future orders, Pure One has established manufacturing capacity capable of producing up to 200 hydrogen fuel cell or BEV vehicles per month.

US President Donald Trump’s “American Energy Dominance” policy is most often viewed through the lens of conservative priorities that favor fossil fuels, but that’s only part of the partisan political picture. Solar power has become an economic lifeline for K–12 school districts, putting it at odds with a long-standing effort to reshape the nation’s politically neutral system of public education.

The US Solar Industry Hearts Public Education

The conservative effort to undercut K–12 public schools has a long history. It stretches far back into the 20th century, when journalists drew media attention to the personal and corporate enrichment of self-proclaimed “school choice” activists.

The same political divide is evident today. While blue states continue to support traditional K–12 public schools as a universal right, a series of new “voucher” laws in red states has raised concerns that the quality of public education will suffer from lack of funding, alongside a fresh wave of book bans and other forms of censorship.

Against this backdrop, solar power has emerged as an ally on the side of public education. Solar projects provide local school districts with new tax dollars and relief from high electricity costs, providing a significant new pillar of support for districts that face stagnating or declining state and federal funding. The extra relief can help school districts manage new restrictions on funding, too. Local solar arrays also provide new opportunities for study in and out of the classroom, and they can serve as platforms for workforce training.

The Power Of Solar Power

One interesting example comes from Texas, where the global energy firm RWE just flipped the switch on its new Stoneridge Solar power plant. The facility is located in Milam County, which bills itself as a “peaceful retreat” between Austin and Waco.

The new power plant includes a 200 megawatt-hour battery energy storage system along with a solar capacity of 200 megawatts, adding another notch to RWE’s 11-gigawatt footprint in in the US. “The project is expected to generate millions in tax revenue for Milam County and the Thorndale Independent School District, with direct investments supporting first responders and educational initiatives,” RWE notes. The non-revenue assist to Milam County schools includes funds for renovating a local elementary school.

Like all school districts in Texas, Milam County faces pressure from rising costs and stagnating assistance from state policymakers. A years-long bottleneck in state funding finally broke last summer, but the bulk of the new $85 billion funding went to increase teacher pay among the state’s 1,200 school systems, not to help offset rising operational costs. The new funds also failed to make a meaningful improvement in the all important metric of per-student allotment. Lawmakers did, however, approve a new $1 billion voucher program for non-public schools, a pet project of Texas Governor Greg Abbott.

Urban Solar Power: 20 Megawatts & Counting

Large, utility-scale solar power plants are beyond the immediate reach of urban school districts, but even a modest rooftop array can provide significant economic and educational benefits. For big cities with numerous schools, the numbers add up.

In October, the education news organization Chalkbeat New York took stock of New York City’s school solar program. “With solar panels on 126 school building rooftops, New York City schools are central to the city and state’s green energy goals and generate the majority of solar energy installed on municipal buildings,” observed reporter Seyma Bayram.

All together, the rooftop arrays have a capacity of almost 20 megawatts, accounting for about 80% of the combined rooftop capacity of all municipal properties in the city.

In addition to the economic and climate action benefits of school solar power, Bayram also teased out yet another significant reason to install rooftop solar at public schools. “More than half of FEMA’s approximately 67,500 designated shelters nationwide are located in schools, making it more urgent to equip them with solar storage systems that can provide backup power during outages,” Bayram explained.

Bayram also cites Sara Ross, whose nonprofit UndauntedK12 advocates for clean energy in schools. “ School budgets are tight, and fundamentally, solar is the cheapest energy around, so when schools install solar, they can reduce their operating costs,” Ross told Chalkbeat. “That frees up more dollars to go back into their core mission.”

Solar can also be a revenue earner in some cases. When school buildings are idle for holidays, their electricity needs are lower, and they can sell unused solar power back to the grid.

On the down side, as part of the fallout from the Republicans’ new “OBBA” federal tax bill, the cost of installing school solar arrays is expected to shoot up by as much as 30% after the end of 2027, when the relevant tax credits are set to expire. New country-of-origin restrictions on solar panels and other equipment could also put a crimp in the school solar movement.

Nevertheless, New York City is not letting the solar power grass grow under its feet. According to Bayram, 90 additional school solar projects are already in motion and 200 more are in the review process.

K–12 Schools As Solar Ambassadors

Despite their radically different political profiles, Texas and New York State are both hotspots for solar development among other renewable energy activities. West Virginia provides another perspective on the school solar movement, considering its longstanding hostility to anything that interferes with fossil energy extraction.

Talk of converting West Virginia’s spent coal mines to solar farms goes back at least as far as 2011, with little to show for it. As of 2020, West Virginia hit the lowly #49 slot in a state-by-state ranking of installed solar capacity, at just 10.52 megawatts. Still, a trickle of new utility-scale power plants benefiting school districts continued to slip through, and the emerging Energy-as-a-Service industry has added another wrinkle.

EaaS contracts enable the client to install new energy efficient systems and equipment without paying upfront costs. They pay off the installer in increments from their savings on energy costs, and pocket the rest for themselves. In some cases, those funds can help support new rooftop solar projects.

Last year, the CMTA branch of the advanced engineering consulting firm Legence recapped its EaaS work with the Grant County, West Virginia school district. The contract included guaranteed energy savings at all four schools in the rural district. One highlight was Petersburg Elementary School, where CMTA focused its “Zero Energy” strategy for introducing renewable energy supported by energy efficiency upgrades.

“The building was not Zero Energy ready prior to this project,” CMTA explained. “The elementary facility had a unique opportunity to have a large solar array installed that would be fully funded by energy savings.”

Power purchase agreements (PPA) are another financial tool aiding the school solar movement in West Virginia. In 2021, state lawmakers approved new legislation enabling schools to use PPA contracts. Among the first to set the wheels in motion was Calhoun County, which entered into a PPA for two of its schools with the firm Secure Solar Futures.

The two projects went live in May of this year. Got Electric, the company that installed the solar arrays, calculates that solar power is offsetting a healthy 70–80% of electricity used by the schools. At that rate, Secure Solar estimates that the school system will save $740,000 over the 25-year term of the agreement.

The Calhoun County project also illustrates the ripple effect of hands-on solar education at schools, with local students now getting a leg up on solar-related scholarships and apprenticeships as well as new job opportunities in their communities.

Who could hate it? West Virginia State Senator Craig Hart (R-Mingo), for one. Earlier this year, Hart proposed new legislation that would pull the rug out from under PPA contracts. “I don’t think a school is a good place to make a political statement about your utilities and whatnot,” Hart reportedly said during a committee meeting in April, while drawing politics into the conversation.

As of 2020 West Virginia hit the lowly #49 slot in a state-by-state ranking of installed solar capacity, at just 10.52 megawatts. Still, a trickle of new utility-scale power plants benefiting school districts continued to slip through, and the emerging Energy-as-a-Service industry has added another wrinkle.

EaaS contracts enable the client to install new energy efficient systems and equipment without paying up-front costs. They pay off the installer in increments from their savings on energy costs, and pocket the rest for themselves. In some cases, those funds can help support new rooftop solar projects.

Last year the CMTA branch of the advanced engineering consulting firm Legence recapped its EaaS work with the Grant County, West Virginia school district. The contract included guaranteed energy savings at all four schools in the rural district. One highlight was Petersburg Elementary School, where CMTA focused its “Zero Energy” strategy for introducing renewable energy supported by energy efficiency upgrades.

“The building was not Zero Energy ready prior to this project,” CMTA explained. “The elementary facility had a unique opportunity to have a large solar array installed that would be fully funded by energy savings.”

Power purchase agreements are another financial tool aiding the school solar movement in West Virginia. In 2021 state lawmakers approved new legislation enabling schools to use PPA contracts. Among the first to set the wheels in motion was Calhoun County, which entered into a PPA for two of its schools with the firm Secure Solar Futures.

The two projects went live in May of this year. Got Electric, the company that installed the solar arrays, calculates that solar power is offsetting a healthy 70–80% of electricity used by the schools. At that rate, Secure Solar estimates that the school system will save $740,000 over the 25-year term of the agreement.

The Calhoun County project also illustrates the ripple effect of hands-on solar education at schools, with local students now getting a leg up on solar-related scholarships and apprenticeships as well as new job opportunities in their communities.

Who could hate it? West Virginia State Senator Craig Hart (R-Mingo), for one. Earlier this year Hart proposed new legislation that would pull the rug out from under PPA contracts. “I don’t think a school is a good place to make a political statement about your utilities and whatnot,” Hart reportedly said during a committee meeting in April, while drawing politics into the conversation.

It was just several days ago that I wrote an article about Tesla launching a huge EV charging hub that runs on solar power. Today I found another one. Though, it actually launched a little before the Tesla one. It’s a new hub with 18 fast chargers for fleet vehicles. The press release from Terawatt Infrastructure says the source of electricity is renewables. “Solar canopies and 100% renewable energy powering every session.”

The location is Rialto, California, about 56 miles east of Los Angeles. The new fleet charging hub provides:

18 pull-through 350kW DC fast-charging stalls

55 bobtail parking stalls for overnight parking, shift changes, and logistics needs

Driver lounge building featuring Wi-Fi, climate control, and restrooms

License plate recognition for seamless entry

Solar canopies and 100% renewable energy powering every session

24/7 security with 360-degree cameras and gated access to protect vehicles, cargo, and drivers.

For people who might think this new site is just a one-off, Terawatt opened a similarly sized hub in April. “The private site, shared among multiple fleets, will house a total of 20 pull-through and bobtail DC fast charging stalls and boast a capacity of 7MW — enabling charging for up to 125 trucks per day.”

But let’s get back to the Rialto hub. “The Rialto site brings Terawatt’s vision of a connected, electrified network to life. It provides fast, reliable, and high-speed pull-through charging along an electric lane that runs from the Ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles through Vernon and Commerce, culminating in Rialto. Our network enables companies to reduce emissions and run a variety of routes across a number of vehicle classes with the confidence of a dependable charging solution. EV fleets can now travel further, more cleanly, without slowing down their operations,” said Neha Palmer, CEO and co-founder of Terawatt.

Solar power canopies generate electricity and don’t require vast amounts of land. They also provide shade and protection from precipitation.

There has been much good news about new EV charger installations lately, despite the loss of the federal EV incentives and a Trump administration that is anti-EV.

Using fully electric medium- and-heavy-duty freight trucks reduces harmful air pollution because they don’t burn diesel fuel or gasoline. There are some environmental benefits as well.

NJ ZIP Incentives for GreenPower

GreenPower Motor Company announced that its full Class 4 EV Star lineup—including the Passenger Van, Mobility Plus, ReeferX, Cab & Chassis, Stakebed, and Utility Truck—is now eligible for major incentives under New Jersey’s newly reopened Zero-Emission Incentive Program (NJ ZIP). Base vouchers start at $65,000 per vehicle and can exceed $90,000 with stackable bonuses.

The NJ ZIP program relaunched November 24, 2025, with $75 million in funding, split into two $37.5 million rounds. GreenPower vehicles qualify on a first-come, first-served basis.

New Jersey also launched the NJ ZEV Financing Program, offering low-interest loans of $50,000 to $500,000 for up to 100% of eligible zero-emission vehicle costs. This financing can be combined with NJ ZIP vouchers or used independently.

GreenPower executives highlighted the company’s ready-to-deliver lineup of passenger, mobility, cargo, refrigerated, and utility configurations, while Wolfington Body Company expressed support for expanding zero-emission fleets across the state.

Pure Lithium Saudi Patent for Brine-to-Battery Technology

Pure Lithium Corporation has received a foundational patent from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for its “Vertically Integrated Pure Lithium Metal Production and Lithium Battery Production” technology. The patent covers the company’s end-to-end Brine to Battery™ process, which unifies lithium extraction, anode production, and battery manufacturing.

CEO Emilie Bodoin noted that Saudi Arabia’s lithium-rich brines and abundant vanadium make it an ideal location for the company’s next-generation battery ecosystem. The company now holds more than 128 patents and applications globally, along with multiple trademarks.

Saudi Arabia’s Energy Capital Group, an investor since 2023, says the technology could give the country a competitive foothold in battery manufacturing with exceptional supply-chain security. Pure Lithium’s metal battery design uses no graphite, nickel, cobalt, or manganese—materials that dominate the current lithium-ion supply chain—while offering lighter, more powerful, and lower-cost performance.

ChargePoint & Dabaja Brothers: Ultra-Fast EV Charging Site in Detroit

ChargePoint has opened a new ultra-fast EV charging site in Canton, Michigan, in partnership with the Dabaja Brothers Development Group. This marks the first of several Dabaja-owned properties that will be equipped with ChargePoint Express Plus fast chargers, with additional sites planned in Dearborn and Livonia.

The rollout aims to fill “fast charging deserts” across metro Detroit by deploying more than 40 fast-charging ports. All stations will run on the new ChargePoint Platform, offering real-time monitoring, flexible pricing, and performance management.

Dabaja Brothers says the project addresses a significant lack of EV charging options in the region. ChargePoint’s Express Plus system supports every EV model, can charge two vehicles simultaneously, and uses advanced cooling to maintain peak charging speeds for quicker, uninterrupted sessions.

Suncoast Charging 1st Fast-Charging Station

Suncoast Charging Corporation has officially opened its first public DC fast-charging station in Land O’ Lakes, Florida, marking the start of its broader EV charging network rollout planned for 2026 and beyond. The station supports up to eight vehicles simultaneously and features 325 kW Tesla V4 Canvas Superchargers, accessible to all EV models with flexible payment options and 24/7 availability.

The company also announced its two Founders: electric mobility veteran David Patrick, who brings extensive leadership in EV infrastructure deployment, and Wesley Sima, whose background in finance and clean energy business development supports Suncoast’s growth strategy.

Suncoast is partnering with Center Connect Development to build its first two premium charging locations: the Hub at Bexley (now open) and the Hub at Lexington Oaks, expected in Q1 2026. These sites were selected for their destination-style amenities, including dining, retail, live music, and community events, serving both local residents and travelers.

Looking ahead, Suncoast plans to open approximately 20 new stations in 2026 as part of a reliable, customer-focused regional network.

The company is also launching a Community & Environmental Partnership Initiative, collaborating with local businesses and environmental groups to feature wildlife-themed charger designs and promote regional habitat preservation.",https://cdn.autoconnectedcar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/staronly.png,N,,2025-11-30 16:00:10.410161

Summary

TC Energy benefited from positive results in 2Q25, beating estimates, with EBITDA guidance being modestly raised, and the current capex remaining static.

Enbridge has vast scale across oil, gas, utilities and renewables. Enbridge’s strategy is to focus on a steady dividend, coupled with modest growth.

Earlier in the year, ONEOK missed 7-8% on EBITDA, which hurt performance for the company.

In 2Q25, Hess Midstream beat street estimates and remains a solid yield play.

Chart: Solar and wind are meeting — and exceeding — new power demand

A few months I posted a link to Michael Liebreich’s excellent two-part essay on the great climate reset. Underpinning Liebreich’s thesis was math: if clean energy exceeds demand by 3% per year for the next 40 years, pretty much everything will be clean shortly after 2060, despite a tripling of demand. I know that’s not fast enough for a lot of folks but for any student of energy history, that would be extremely fast.

And so far this year, solar and wind growth has outpaced demand by over 5%.

Throw in nuclear and new clean supply has outpaced demand by over 10%.

It’s only nine months but it’s extremely encouraging nonetheless.

Texas Grid Operators and Regulators Iron Out New Rules for Data Centers - Inside Climate News

This article provides a good overview of the various rulemakings underway to implement Senate Bill 6 — and the need for them.

The large load interconnection queue faced by ERCOT, Texas’ power grid, is now dominated by data centers, according to data from ERCOT’s latest system planning and weatherization update. Compared with September 2024, ERCOT now is tracking more than three times as many large load interconnections, with nearly 69% of the large load requests coming from data centers. By contrast, in May 2024, non-cryptocurrency data centers made up less than half of the large power demand requests.

While writer Arcelia Martin highlights the many concerns swirling around data center development, she also highlights an important perspective I often talk and write about here: Texas is a unique place for this kind of development which could inure to Texas’ benefit:

For Woody Rickerson, chief operating officer of ERCOT, the new rules outlined in SB6 are exemplary of why Texas is an opportune place for the growth of data centers, particularly those servicing artificial intelligence.

Grid operators and regulators want to move quickly, he said at a Sept. 30 data center industry conference in San Antonio.

Rickerson said in recent years, the state has proven it can transform the grid through the widespread adoption of renewable energy in ERCOT. The state’s independent grid now hosts more solar, wind and batteries than any other state in the country, with operators saying it can grant customers access to large amounts of power without the bureaucracy other grids face.

“We can change. We can adapt,” Rickerson said. “We can put new processes in place more quickly.”

Much more on how data centers could strengthen the grid here:

Approximately four out of five Americans surveyed supported the Endangered Species Act, according to the International Fund for Animal Welfare.","Several United States environmental policies may be weakened or removed following a week of announcements by various agencies with plans to introduce major changes. This could mark the largest rollback of environmental protections under any administration.

In November, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed to remove federal protections from millions of acres of wetlands and streams, thereby reducing the power of the 1972 Clean Water Act. The EPA said it planned to more narrowly define “waters of the United States” to exclude many wetlands and streams, which is expected to take away federal protections from up to 55 million acres of wetlands, or about 85 percent of all wetlands nationwide, according to the environmental group the Natural Resources Defence Council.

Just two days later, federal wildlife agencies announced changes to the Endangered Species Act, which may make it more difficult to rescue endangered species from the brink of extinction. The move would permit the government to assess economic factors, such as the loss of revenues by not exploiting the land in question, before deciding whether to list a species as endangered, rather than assessing the region based on purely scientific evidence.

Another day later, the Interior Department announced plans to allow for new oil and gas drilling across almost 1.3 billion acres of U.S. coastal waters, with as many as 34 lease sales in federal waters. The agency is exploring the potential for holding lease sales in California, the Gulf of Mexico, and the Arctic waters of Alaska.

Pat Parenteau, a professor of climate policy at Vermont Law and Graduate School, said, “This was the week from hell for environmental policy in the United States… Unless stopped by the courts, each of these proposed rollbacks will do irreparable harm to the nation’s water quality, endangered species and marine ecosystems.”

Ironically, the move to dismantle some of the strongest environmental protections in the United States took place as many world leaders were attending the COP30 climate summit in Brazil. President Trump did not attend COP30, making it the first time in the summit’s 30-year history that the United States was not present.

White House representatives said that the moves supported Trump’s American energy dominance agenda, which he has been pushing for several months. In recent months, Trump has signed a flurry of executive orders taking target at the growing green energy sector, and instead favouring the expansion of U.S. fossil fuels.

This has been met with mounting criticism from environmental groups who claim that Trump is not fulfilling his legal obligations by scrapping several major environmental policies. However, several industries support the latest move, including farming groups, oil drillers, chemical manufacturers, home builders, and real estate developers. Nevertheless, finalising the three proposals could take up to two years, during which time the government may have to endure lengthy legal battles over the proposals.

Many Americans are in favour of the environmental protections currently in place. Approximately four out of five Americans surveyed supported the Endangered Species Act, according to the International Fund for Animal Welfare. Meanwhile, 81 percent of Americans who were polled said they were concerned about the environment, including the welfare of animals and nature.

Kristen Boyles, an attorney with environmental law group Earthjustice, said in a statement, “Trump’s attacks on the Endangered Species Act seriously misread the room. Most people are not going to allow the sacrifice of our natural world to a bunch of billionaires and corporate interests.”

However, the EPA administrator Lee Zeldin said that he aims to establish regulations that would be “durable and withstand future swings of presidential elections to come.” He said he expected significant environmental rollbacks to be taken in 2025. “We will do more deregulation in one year than entire federal governments in the past have done across all federal agencies combined,” said Zeldin.

In addition to the recent attacks on environmental protections, the Trump administration is making several changes to the Department of Energy (DoE), seemingly aimed at weakening the agency’s research and support for green energy and cleantech initiatives.

The DoE posted a revised organisational chart this month, which no longer shows the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, the Office of Manufacturing and Energy Supply Chains, or the Grid Deployment Office, which have previously provided financial support for clean energy sectors. This follows moves by Trump earlier in the year to cut Biden-era funding destined for decarbonisation projects.

The efforts by the Trump administration to rein in clean energy spending and reduce environmental protections double down on President Trump’s goal to roll back the aims outlined in Biden’s climate policies, in favour of the expansion of U.S. fossil fuels. However, we will likely see pushback from environmental organisations and communities across the country who oppose these moves.

But who should pay for these losses?
These scores have mostly been generated by First Street – a private company that takes publically available information about climate risk, and downscales it to the lot level using a proprietary algorithm.
That is a (relative) loss to those owners, for something that is not their fault (at least directly).
Additionally, lower (relative) prices mean lower (relative) real estate commissions, and thus this has upset the realtor industry as well.","Climate risk scores on real estate listings are having an impact on prices and realtors are complaining. But who should pay for these losses?

If you have been browsing Zillow or Redfin in recent years, you may have noticed that (in the US at least), listings have been accompanied by a property risk score for fire, flood, air quality, etc. These scores have mostly been generated by First Street – a private company that takes publically available information about climate risk, and downscales it to the lot level using a proprietary algorithm.

Here’s an example for a home in Houston, Texas:

Since this has been common, analysts have noticed that the worst-ranked homes for risk are suffering from relative price declines, particularly for homes at risk of flooding. This seems like a natural outcome, the higher the risk of flooding, the more expensive insurance will be, and if you can’t get insurance, the higher the risk of financial loss, and thus there is a reduction of price to compensate. If this was a static situation, then ideally these additional costs/risks would have been built into the historical prices and new prices wouldn’t be any worse affected. However, the situation is not static.

Intense rain events, wild fires, coastal flooding etc. are becoming more common in many places (while air quality issues are decreasing), and so risks to properties are changing over time, and homeowners are finding that they may not be able to sell their home for as much as they expected. That is a (relative) loss to those owners, for something that is not their fault (at least directly). Additionally, lower (relative) prices mean lower (relative) real estate commissions, and thus this has upset the realtor industry as well.

This is actually a big problem

Sympathy for brokers is not high outside of the industry (to say the least), and their struggles are not going to win many hearts or minds, but the bigger issue is much more serious. Climate changes are going to lead to increased future losses not just because of more ‘stuff’ being built (a big factor in increasing historical damages), but also because existing properties are facing more risk.

For example, take a row of houses along the North Carolina dunes, one of which fell into the sea this summer. Sea level there is rising (even more than the global mean), predominantly as a function of human impacts on the climate. Thus, a home built in 1976 that Zillow values at over $400,000 is now actually not worth anything. There are many less extreme examples where rainfall intensity increases are leading to more risks of flooding, or increases in fire weather etc. but the point is that areas of higher hazards are expanding and, objectively, many property values are (relatively) decreasing.

Generally speaking, property value rises and falls are felt by the current owners – they benefit (when they sell) if an area becomes more desirable, or take a loss if the opposite occurs. Public policy can impact this, but mostly society deals with this via changes in property taxes and assessments (in the US at least). The impacts due to climate changes are different though – these are changes that can in fact be blamed on our historical emissions that we have known for decades have been having such an effect.

Previously, it was a situation like pass-the-parcel – whoever was left holding the property when the impact was felt (the flood, the fire, the collapse into the sea) would end up paying for it or, at best, split the losses with their insurance company. The risk factor information is helping spread the costs to the current owners (as well as the future owners), which (I think) is a bit fairer but, of course, the costs are not being borne by the people causing the issue (the fossil fuel companies, the people that used their products etc.). People have also argued that society writ large should cover these losses – that regional or federal governments either through grants or insurance payouts should compensate owners, while others argue that the oil and gas companies should pay.

There is a real issue in how reliable these risk assessments are – if they are wildly different from different companies or approaches, or if the algorithms are proprietary, then it’s possible the impacts from releasing this information will be sub-optimal. But both Florida (h/t Kelly Hereid) (for hurricane damage) and California (wildfires) are leading the way in having public, open source, catastrophe models, and conceivably that could be spread more widely.

In practice, there is going to be a patchwork of different ideas, and different models, but there is no (sensible) answer that is based on ignoring the risks to keep prices artificially high. Even realtors should be able to accept that, and if they want to be compensated for their loss of commissions, they should get in line to sue the people who caused it.

Hydrogen power plants could be the answer to a greener future and a way to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels. Hydrogen plants are rare, with only four currently producing low-carbon hydrogen in Europe, but a new project, HySynergy, was recently inaugurated in Denmark, according to Tech Xplore.

The plant is powered by solar and wind energy, and it will produce around ""eight tonnes of hydrogen a day in its first phase,"" per Tech Xplore. This hydrogen will then be transported to a nearby refinery and to Germany.

Though this power option has been slow to take off, it presents a real, positive solution to air pollution caused by burning fossil fuels. When hydrogen is burned, it only creates water vapor, rather than the harmful pollutants that are released when burning oil or gas.

The plant will initially produce 20 megawatts of power, with ambitions of producing up to 350 megawatts. This could power up to 315,000 homes for a whole year.

Green hydrogen is one of the most expensive forms of power, due to the large amounts of electricity it uses to produce hydrogen fuel. It is created through electrolysis, where an electrical current is used to separate the hydrogen from oxygen in water. However, as the cost of renewable energy sources drops, the cost of hydrogen should also become more affordable.

There are many exciting advancements in green hydrogen, such as researchers finding a way to make the electrolysis work on seawater as well as freshwater.

Jakob Korsgaard, founder and CEO of Everfuel, which owns 51% of the HySynergy project, said: ""The growth of green hydrogen depends on the political momentum.""

Without sufficient funding from governments and support for renewable energy sources by politicians, many of these expensive projects can't get off the ground.

""The momentum behind hydrogen is strong. In total, 60 governments (including the European Union) have adopted hydrogen strategies,"" the International Energy Agency commented.

""However, faster action is required to create demand for low-emissions hydrogen and unlock investment that can accelerate production scale-up and bring down the costs of technologies for producing and using low-emissions hydrogen.""

The Last Roadhouse: A Glimmer Of The Past In A Rapidly Changing Collin County

Raveling North on State Highway 121 in Collin County, suburbia sprawls, just as it has throughout the rest of North Texas. Rolling farms and ranchlands are now cut and stripped and peppered with subdivisions, restaurants and developments meant to entertain the masses moving in.

This move reflects a shift in strategy and capital allocation.

The reshuffling of Hut 8’s assets has coincided with striking share price volatility. The 1-day share price return recently surged 6.2%, and the 7-day return jumped over 31%. However, the 30-day period saw an 11.2% decline. Still, the stock is up more than 100% year-to-date, and its total shareholder return over the past year stands at 60.6%, suggesting momentum is building around the company’s latest moves and renewed strategic focus.

If you’re eager to expand your search beyond Hut 8, now is a great time to discover .

With such a dramatic stock rally and ongoing strategic changes, the real question is whether Hut 8’s current share price still offers a bargain or if the market is already factoring in the company’s future growth prospects.

Most Popular Narrative: 22.2% Undervalued

Compared to Hut 8's last close price of $45.00, the most closely followed narrative assigns a significantly higher fair value. This highlights a notable mismatch in market expectations versus narrative-driven projections.

The Power First strategy, featuring sizable pipeline origination (10.8 GW under diligence; 3.1 GW under exclusivity) and dual-purpose sites for both Bitcoin mining and AI compute, provides scalability and flexibility to benefit from rising institutional adoption of digital assets and accelerating demand for clean energy-powered blockchain infrastructure. This supports future revenue and earnings growth.

Wondering what numbers are powering such an aggressive valuation? Take a closer look at the rapid-fire revenue expansion and bold margin assumptions beneath the surface. You'll want to see which game-changing metrics and leap-of-faith forecasts are at the heart of this hot take.

Result: Fair Value of $57.87 (UNDERVALUED)

Still, disruptions in Bitcoin prices or delays in converting the development pipeline into revenue could quickly challenge the bullish outlook surrounding Hut 8’s story.

Another View: Looking at Market Ratios

While the narrative-based valuation pitches Hut 8 as markedly undervalued, our look at market price-to-earnings ratios paints a different picture. Hut 8's 23.8x ratio is well below the software industry average of 31.8x, yet it stands dramatically higher than its fair ratio of 7x and even above some peers. This gap suggests that, despite seemingly favorable comparisons, there may be valuation risk if the market reverts closer to the fair ratio over time, especially if growth stalls.

The order requires PJM, working with Constellation Energy, to ensure Units 3 and 4 remain operational and to limit costs to consumers. The Department of Energy said continued electricity production from the units is essential to avoid blackouts during the coming winter months.

“Thanks to President Trump’s leadership, the Department of Energy is using all tools available to keep the lights on and heat running for the American people,” Wright said. He added that the emergency directive is critical to maintaining affordable and dependable power during periods of high demand.

The two Eddystone units were already operating beyond their planned retirement date due to a previous emergency action issued May 30, 2025, followed by an additional directive on August 28. DOE said the facility played a significant role during heat waves in June and July, when PJM called on the units to help stabilize the grid.

PJM’s region is expected to continue facing “emergency conditions both in the near and long term,” according to DOE. The grid operator set a new winter peak in January 2025, surpassing a record that had stood since 2015.

The order takes effect November 26, 2025, and runs through February 24, 2026.

PJM has repeatedly warned federal regulators and Congress about escalating reliability risks tied to rising electricity demand, slow entry of new generation resources, and accelerating retirements of existing power plants. A February 2023 analysis highlighted concerns about the timing mismatch between retirements and new capacity. In a December 2024 filing with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, PJM reported “substantial increases” in expected load growth and stated its reliability concerns were “increasing at an extraordinary pace.”

During a March 2025 hearing before the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, PJM President and CEO Manu Asthana told lawmakers the grid operator faces a “growing resource adequacy concern” affecting a large portion of the country.

DOE’s own Resource Adequacy Report warns that power outages could rise dramatically by 2030 if reliable power sources continue to be removed from the system.

Some aren’t quite ready so they leave the queue, but they still ask and expect their place to be saved. Others with vital immediate work to do have no choice but to wait outside the door. In the confusion, no one knows who should really take priority. Delay and uncertainty ensue.

That’s a bit like the way connecting to Britain’s electricity system has been working. Strong, ready-to-go projects are being left behind and waiting a decade to connect as a result.

• Fears grow over surge in electricity demand from data centres

Despite the initial successes of the first-come, first-served approach to grid connections, which helped the early and rapid deployment of renewable power and batteries, there were unintended consequences.

The value of having a connection offer led to more unviable and speculative projects, with no intention to build. Outdated rules meant that for any project, plans had to be made to design and build the pylons, offshore and onshore electricity cables to support them. All at a cost to the consumer.

As a result, the queue has grown tenfold in just five years, and together the projects in it exceed 800GW, four times the generation needed by 2030.

Dormant projects have blocked promising clean energy ventures that are ready to connect and have stood in the way of further clean economic growth across Great Britain. That must change.

By abolishing the first-come, first-served system, we can ensure that the connections process enables what is needed, when it’s needed, where it’s needed. Neso can free up space for shovel-ready wind and solar power, and make room for the data centres and electric vehicle superhubs of the future.

Neso will soon begin informing projects from the previous queue whether they have been moved to a new delivery pipeline. What we’ve been clear about is that not every project can progress in this round.

But Neso and Schroders Greencoat know that clearing the gridlock is essential to giving developers and investors the certainty they need to unlock jobs, develop supply chains and supercharge £40 billion a year of economic growth.

Overhauling the connections process isn’t a panacea. Transmission owners still need to build thousands of kilometres of new electricity cables. Planning reforms must be implemented.

But by putting in place these major changes to how we plug in to the grid, we are taking a big step forwards to help make sure the vast economic potential of Britain’s clean energy transition is realised.",https://www.thetimes.com/imageserver/image/%2Fae271929-5281-4399-a97d-0dc7d28cbcaa.jpg?crop=1600%2C900%2C0%2C0&resize=1200,N,,2025-11-30 13:59:57.410263
,Congress,2025-11-30 18:03:44+00:00,The Hill,Next steps for the Trump trade agenda - The Hill,"Former Rep. Dan Lipinski (D-Ill.), opinion contributor, opinion contributor",,,,,https://thehill.com/opinion/international/5626178-antidumping-laws-foreign-threats/,"During my tenure in Congress, I shared many of the president’s grievances with American trade policy and I maintain those views now.
But there is another trade policy area where the Trump administration should focus its energy and pursue reforms to offer relief to American manufacturers.
As this cheating continues, American businesses lose customers and markets to the under-valued foreign products causing harm which can be long-lasting.
Perhaps not surprisingly, China is the biggest violator of U.S. anti-dumping orders, comprising 26 percent of adjudicated cases since 2020.
It is essential that we reinvigorate American manufacturing by enforcing fair competition and President Trump’s trade policies have the potential to do that.","A hallmark of each of President Trump’s terms in office has been his focus on trade issues. He has sought to use the power of the presidency to address perceived imbalances in the benefits of trade with foreign partners, and to put in place policies — led by tariffs — to encourage businesses to reshore and invest in manufacturing in the United States.

During my tenure in Congress, I shared many of the president’s grievances with American trade policy and I maintain those views now. We as a country have been too willing to sit back and accept a shift of production to countries that have lower labor, environmental and other standards, allowing multi-national companies to make increased profits on goods that they sell back to us as imports. Consequently, manufacturing jobs have fallen drastically, industrial investment in the U.S. has dropped, and the communities that rely on these mainstays have experienced economic decline. America lost roughly 5 million manufacturing jobs between 2000 and 2020. I am hopeful that by applying tariffs smartly, President Trump can set in motion a fundamental change in this trend and reinvigorate production and manufacturing in the U.S.

But there is another trade policy area where the Trump administration should focus its energy and pursue reforms to offer relief to American manufacturers. While tariffs are often applied broadly against all imports from specific countries or on a class of imported products, antidumping laws and duties are narrowly applied to address violations of American trade law by specific foreign countries.

When foreign entities are found to be selling their goods in the U.S. at below market value with the intent of undercutting American companies, these duties are applied against those imports to penalize unfair trade practices and even the playing field for domestic producers. Such relief is critical, especially for small and medium-sized manufacturers.

However, even when a petition for relief is successful, foreign companies can find ways to evade the application of the duties. For example, after one American small business prevailed in its anti-dumping claims against European producers, the same products were found being shipped through third-country routes under new product names, seeking to evade Customs and duty payments. As this cheating continues, American businesses lose customers and markets to the under-valued foreign products causing harm which can be long-lasting.

According to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), the number of anti-dumping (and countervailing duty) cases enforced by the agency increased from 540 in 2020 to 716 in 2024, a 33 percent increase, indicating that these foreign threats continue to grow. Perhaps not surprisingly, China is the biggest violator of U.S. anti-dumping orders, comprising 26 percent of adjudicated cases since 2020. But plenty of developed countries make the list too, with South Korea, India, Japan, and even Italy making the top ten. Despite the breadth of these violations, CBP only collected $2 billion in duty deposits and levied $80 million in penalties for violations in FY24.

The process for filing an anti-dumping claim can be expensive and time consuming. Specialized legal support is often required to help small businesses investigate and file claims, and the adjudication process can take months if not years. Approved anti-dumping claims are then subject to annual reviews, adding to costs and delays in applying duties. Efforts by American businesses to prove violations of dumping laws and evasion of duties require “non-public” information which is difficult and expensive to obtain.

Moving forward, CBP should utilize some of the significant new funding it recently received to better enforce anti-dumping laws and deter and penalize those who seek to evade these laws. The Commerce Department should update its procedures and modernize the process to make it more efficient and effective. Congress should consider changes in law to prevent any U.S. government entity or federal contractor from buying or utilizing imports that are subject to anti-dumping laws. Commerce should establish an ombudsman office to help small and medium-sized American businesses understand and file anti-dumping cases as a means of relief from the legal costs that may otherwise impede them from pursuing these cases.

The agency should also consider expedited procedures for filings and annual reviews, especially for smaller-sized petitioners. Finally, the United States should encourage the World Trade Organization to revise its rules on anti-dumping which have not been updated since the 1990s and are well overdue for reform.

It is essential that we reinvigorate American manufacturing by enforcing fair competition and President Trump’s trade policies have the potential to do that. A key component of those policies, however, must be strengthening the protections that we have in place to punish foreign entities who cheat our trade laws, which will allow American companies and their workers to thrive.

Community energy groups and not-for-profit organisations across NSW can apply for grants up to $600,000 to scale up their work helping households adopt renewable technologies, access incentives and rebates, improve energy efficiency and navigate the transition to cleaner, smarter energy solutions.

Funded projects could include community education workshops, one-on-one energy guidance, adapting existing programs for wider audiences, creating digital tools, staffing local advisory roles and developing marketing or communication campaigns to reach more households. Other innovative projects addressing local energy needs will also be considered.

Professor Ty Christopher, Director of Energy Futures Network at the University of Wollongong’s Faculty of Engineering and Information Sciences, said this kind of support could supercharge what Illawarra community groups had already been building in the region.

“One thing we’ve seen here in the Illawarra is a terrifically positive group of grassroots organisations such as Electrify 2515, Hi Neighbour and Good for the Gong to increase energy literacy in the community,” he said.

“These community-driven efforts are incredible, but there comes a time, if all this good work is for the benefit of the public, that the government charged with serving that public should help things along. This funding will help with just that.

“Pardon the pun, but more power to them, as they support these community activation efforts not just to kick off, but to build and maintain momentum.”

The program forms part of the NSW Government’s Consumer Energy Strategy, which aims to put households and small businesses at the centre of the state’s clean energy transition.

It also supports early planning for the Illawarra Renewable Energy Zone (REZ), enhancing the capacity of local groups to help residents integrate technologies such as rooftop solar, batteries, energy-efficient appliances and home electrification into the region’s evolving energy system.

Member for Wollongong Paul Scully said the program would position the Illawarra at the forefront of NSW’s clean energy future.

“The Illawarra is at the centre of NSW’s clean industrial future and this program will help the community further embrace renewable energy and prepare to be home to the state’s first urban renewable energy zone,” he said.

“Crucially it will help to better inform everyone in the Illawarra from community groups to businesses and individual households on renewables so we can all work together to lead the way for renewable energy generation in urban areas.”

It comes as the Australian Research Council (ARC) Future Grids Training Centre at the University of Wollongong (UOW) prepares to host the IEEE International Conference on Energy Technologies for Future Grids (ETFG 2025) next month, bringing together global experts to explore the future of clean, reliable and resilient energy systems.

The conference will welcome researchers, policymakers and industry leaders from Australia and around the world to address the challenges and opportunities in transforming Australia’s electricity networks.

CATL and Stellantis start a €4.1bn LFP battery gigafactory in Zaragoza, Spain, set to supply up to 1M EVs yearly, create 4,000 jobs, and run on renewable energy.

In Zaragoza, Spain, a groundbreaking ceremony marked the start of construction on one of Europe’s largest battery factories. Chinese battery maker CATL and automaker Stellantis are launching a €4.1 billion joint project. The site is set to underpin the next phase of the EU’s electric transition, with capacity to supply batteries for up to one million electric cars a year — an output that turns policy targets into production reality.

The gigafactory will focus on lithium iron phosphate (LFP) cells and, across the lifetime of all units produced, could cut more than 30 million tonnes of CO2. Production is scheduled to begin at the end of 2026. More than 4,000 direct jobs are planned, with thousands more indirectly, a scale likely to jump-start a local supply chain rather than simply add another pin to the map.

The financing, arranged as a second tranche under a mechanism led by Standard Bank, was confirmed last week and now awaits deployment across key industrial markets where energy insecurity continues to restrain growth.

The transaction builds on the first tranche closed in December 2024 as reported by Ecofin Agency, which opened space for additional participation from Norfund, Impact Fund Denmark and the Emerging Africa and Asia Infrastructure Fund in the course of 2025.

These institutions, all focused on climate-aligned investment, have backed CBE on the basis of a business model that removes up-front power infrastructure costs for companies and replaces them with long-term offtake agreements.

The financing momentum accelerated further in July, when the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) approved a US$495 million guarantee to shelter CBE’s assets from currency volatility and transfer restrictions in countries where macroeconomic fluctuations have historically deterred private capital.

CBE’s approach centers on fully financed renewable systems, primarily solar and storage, that industrial clients pay for through consumption rather than capital expenditure. This has been especially appealing to firms in mining, manufacturing and telecommunications, where unpredictable grid supply and high diesel costs erode profit margins.

One of its flagship developments is a 30-megawatt solar-plus-storage unit under construction for the Kamoa-Kakula copper mine in the Democratic Republic of Congo. If completed on schedule, it will deliver steady baseload power that reduces shutdown risks, lowers operating costs and curbs emissions in a region where diesel generators remain the fallback for most industrial sites.

The scale of the new debt facility signals that lenders are increasingly willing to back decentralized renewable infrastructure in markets once considered too high-risk. However, the financing gap remains vast. IRENA’s most recent figures show that sub-Saharan Africa received only around 2 percent of global renewable energy investment in 2024, amounting to less than a tenth of what analysts estimate the region requires annually to meet medium-term demand.

Countries such as Kenya, South Africa, Egypt and Morocco continue to draw the bulk of capital, while frontier markets, including parts of West and Central Africa, rely heavily on concessional finance and guarantee structures like the one CBE secured from MIGA.

The implications extend beyond the energy sector. Reliable power is one of the most significant determinants of competitiveness for African industries. The mining sector alone accounts for more than 30 percent of export revenues in countries like Zambia and the DRC, yet outages often push firms to spend as much as 20 percent of operating budgets on alternative power.

In manufacturing hubs such as Nigeria and Ghana, grid instability forces companies to run diesel generators for between 30 and 60 percent of operating hours, inflating production costs and undermining sustainability commitments. Projects financed under CBE’s model have the potential to reverse part of this trend by embedding long-term cost predictability into industrial supply chains.

Africa’s broader energy transition hinges on whether capital can reach commercially viable projects at scale, and whether those projects can demonstrate performance strong enough to pull in more investors. The latest financing round positions CBE among a handful of firms attempting to prove that renewable power in frontier markets is bankable when structured with the right risk protections and operational guarantees.

If the pipeline proceeds as planned, the company’s installations could serve as reference points for lenders assessing similar opportunities across the continent. For now, the US$200 million secured marks a step forward in linking private capital to Africa’s energy needs, offering industrial consumers alternatives to unreliable grids and high-carbon fuels.",https://africasustainabilitymatters.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/croed-energy.jpg,N,,2025-11-30 14:00:25.566636

The old warehouse strip reborn as the Lee + White development is a popular destination for anyone seeking a bite or a beverage on the Atlanta Beltline’s Westside Trail. But steps from the breweries and eateries inhabiting much of the space, serious science is taking place.

In an industrial space at the complex’s north end, engineers in blue lab coats huddle over circuit boards. Scientists test how certain films and other materials respond to pressure, heat and more. And in a machine shop off the main lab, a computer-controlled machine mills custom components from raw metal.

The space is a hive of activity, one that exudes the spirit of experimentation embodied by its founder, the legendary inventor Lonnie Johnson.

Johnson isn’t a household name like Thomas Edison or Alexander Graham Bell. You’ll be hard-pressed, however, to find a child of the 1990s who isn’t familiar with his most famous invention: the Super Soaker. The ubiquitous water gun has produced an estimated $1 billion in sales over its lifetime.

“Inventing, for me anyway, is looking for a good problem to tackle,” Johnson said.

At 76, the prolific inventor is not done hunting for solutions, and he believes the one his team is refining steps from the Beltline — the Johnson Thermo-Electrochemical Converter, or JTEC — could be his most significant yet.

Johnson and outside experts say the JTEC is a “novel” energy device. It’s not a battery or a fuel cell, and it doesn’t fit neatly into other conventional categories.

What it is, Johnson thinks, is a potential key to unlock a huge power source that’s rarely utilized today: waste heat. At the same time, he thinks it could help humanity slow climate change and meet its seemingly insatiable need for more electricity.

It’s still relatively early days for the company, but Johnson and other JTEC executives think the future is bright — if they can clear the hurdles that come with scaling any first-of-its-kind technology.

Capturing waste heat

A trained nuclear engineer, Johnson served in the Air Force and later worked on NASA’s Galileo mission. A lifelong inventor, he has more than 140 patents to his name and was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2022.

Energy issues have been a driving force behind Johnson’s innovations for years. In fact, an “aha” moment working on a more efficient heat pump — a type of home heating and cooling system — is what led to the Super Soaker.

In the late 1980s, while experimenting at home with new nozzles he’d fashioned, he shot a stream of water across his bathroom.

“I thought, you know, a high-performance water gun would be a lot of fun,” Johnson said.

The idea for the JTEC wasn’t quite as spontaneous. It was born about 20 years ago, while Johnson was researching solid state batteries — an intense focus of automakers and other industries to this day.

The JTEC has few moving parts, no combustion and no exhaust. All the work to generate electricity is done by hydrogen, the most abundant element in the universe.

Inside the device, pressurized hydrogen gas is separated by a thin, filmlike membrane, with low pressure gas on one side and high pressure gas on the other. The difference in pressure in this “stack” is what drives the hydrogen to compress and expand, creating electricity as it circulates. And unlike a fuel cell, it does not need to be refueled with more hydrogen.

All that’s needed to keep the process going and electricity flowing is a heat source. As it turns out, there are enormous amounts of energy vented or otherwise lost from industrial facilities like power plants, factories, breweries and more.

Between 20% and 50% of all energy used for industrial processes is dumped into the atmosphere and lost as waste heat, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.

‘Power … from just about anywhere’

The JTEC works with high temperatures, but the device’s ability to generate electricity efficiently from low-grade heat sources is what company executives are most excited about.

Inside JTEC’s headquarters, engineers show off a demonstration unit that can power lights and a sound system with water that’s roughly 200 degrees Fahrenheit — below the boiling point and barely warm enough to brew a cup of tea, said Julian Bell, JTEC’s vice president of engineering.

Comas Haynes, a research engineer at the Georgia Tech Research Institute specializing in thermal and hydrogen system designs, agrees the company could “hit a sweet spot” if it can capitalize on lower temperature heat. Haynes is not affiliated with JTEC.

For Johnson, the potential application he’s most excited about lies beneath our feet.

Geothermal energy exists naturally in rocks and water beneath the Earth’s surface at various depths. Tapping into that resource through abandoned oil and gas wells — a well-known access point for underground heat — offers another opportunity.

“You don’t need batteries and you can draw power when you need it from just about anywhere,” Johnson said.

Right now, the company is building its first commercial JTEC unit, which is set to be deployed early next year. Mike McQuary, JTEC’s CEO and the former president of the pioneering internet service provider MindSpring, said he couldn’t reveal the customer, but said it’s a “major Southeast utility company.”

“Crossing that bridge where you have commercial customers that believe in it and will pay for it is important,” McQuary said.

‘Horse race’

The challenge for JTEC, as for all startups, is whether the company can control costs as it scales its product.

It took decades for renewables like wind and solar to bend their respective cost curves to compete with fossil fuels. McQuary said the company can’t wait that long, and its focus now is on sourcing the specialized materials it needs, while it works to drive down cost.

Haynes from Georgia Tech said he’s “generally optimistic” about the JTEC, especially if it can find ways to put low-quality heat to good use.

“The lower the temperature it can accommodate, the more novel it will be,” he said.

On top of some initial seed money, the company brought in $30 million in a Series A funding in 2022 — money that allowed the company to move to its Lee + White headquarters and hire more than 30 engineers. McQuary said it expects to begin another round of fundraising soon.

Johnson, meanwhile, hasn’t stopped working on new inventions.

He continues to refine the design for his solid-state battery — the one that spawned the JTEC. Solid-state batteries have long been considered the “holy grail” for battery makers, offering more range in electric vehicles, shorter charging times and improved safety.

Watching his battery venture progress alongside JTEC has been like a “horse race,” Johnson said. He’s still not sure which one will cross the finish line first.

“I‘ve got teams for both technologies now,” Johnson said. “Sometimes, one is ahead of the other in getting to commercialization … but it’s fun watching them solving their own problems in their individual space.”

A Bloomberg report on Saturday claimed China, citing Goldman Sachs economists, is squeezing developing nations by dominating both low- and high-tech manufacturing. The article bluntly characterizes China's strategy as a ""beggar-thy-neighbor"" threat to the global economy.

Dressed up in the language of data and economics, this narrative is less a neutral assessment and more a repackaged version of the old ""China manufacturing threat"" storyline.

Its political intent is hard to miss: to recast China not only as a challenger to the US and Europe, but also as a spoiler of other developing countries' prospects - thereby justifying a broader coalition in support of decoupling policies against Beijing.

For years, parts of the Western commentariat have relied on zero-sum thinking to explain China's rise.

A decade ago, the refrain was that China had ""stolen American blue-collar jobs."" Today, the script has been updated: China is now supposedly ""stealing"" Africa's industrialization, Southeast Asia's export growth and Latin America's development space.

The claim that ""China is crowding out other developing countries"" is simply another layer of rhetorical wrapping around a broader strategy of ""de-risking from China.""

The problem is that this story does not hold up against the facts. In recent years, Chinese outward direct investment and industrial cooperation have expanded rapidly. Chinese companies have established industrial parks and production bases in Vietnam, Indonesia, Mexico, Egypt, Ethiopia and many other countries, bringing not just capital and equipment, but also technology, management expertise, and, crucially, jobs.

Across Africa, Southeast Asia, the Middle East and Latin America, Chinese-built railways, ports, power plants and telecom networks are providing critical infrastructure that many countries had long lacked.

The statement that China is ""taking its industries abroad"" is much more accurate than saying it is ""clinging to low-end manufacturing at home.""

Key segments of Chinese-linked industrial chains are being reconfigured across borders. Many emerging economies are actively drawing on elements of China's development experience to upgrade their own manufacturing. Through this kind of chain extension, developing countries can plug into global production networks more quickly by leveraging Chinese capacity, while also exporting more in complementary sectors. That is a pathway to faster industrialization, not a roadblock.

This is what the West is most worried about: The development of manufacturing in more developing countries will ultimately shake the West's dominance in more fields.

It is not a result of Chinese competition, but of the long-standing division of labor dominated by advanced economies and the resurgence of protectionism in the West. For decades, a small group of rich countries has controlled key technologies, standards and financial rules, keeping high-value, high-margin activities at home while offloading labor-intensive and resource-intensive segments abroad. Many developing economies have been stuck at the bottom of global value chains as a result.

Now, under the banners of ""national security"" and ""de-risking,"" the US and some of its allies are erecting new tariff and technology barriers, championing ""friendshoring"" and building ""small yards and high fences"" to restructure supply chains in ways that explicitly sideline China and, in practice, also limit the policy autonomy of many Global South countries. Western efforts to ""contain China"" are increasingly being projected into the wider developing world, seeking to weaken trade and industrial ties between these countries and China. That is what a genuine beggar-thy-neighbor strategy looks like - and it is a more credible explanation of who has historically taken the ""jobs and opportunities"" of the developing world.

China, by contrast, has sought to offer an alternative through initiatives such as the Belt and Road Initiative and the Global Development Initiative - built on principles of extensive consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits. This approach does not pretend that there are no interests at stake; instead, it recognizes that sustainable cooperation is in all parties' long-term interest and that development rights should be more equally shared.

China's development has never been an isolated success story. It has unfolded alongside, and increasingly in partnership with, the broader developing world. Sharing opportunities, supporting partners and contributing to global growth through concrete actions, not slogans, is the strongest possible response to any ""China threat"" narrative.",https://www.globaltimes.cn/Portals/0/attachment/2025/2025-11-30/87be9e0f-cf7b-49cc-be46-b930bfb4ee1b.jpeg,N,,2025-11-30 14:01:13.000745

The region has seen the government advancing initiatives to grow the wind power sector, and through the new deal with Nordex, the Irish wind power market is set to become a dominant force in the region’s energy market.

Wind power projects have become immensely popular in Europe

Several European nations have revived their wind power ambitions in recent years amid calls to diversify the global energy market. Wind power’s potential to deliver large-scale energy projects is commendable, add to that the clean energy and emission reduction properties, and one questions why more nations are not turning to the wind sector.

The climate in Europe is perfect for wind power projects, almost as if the region were designed to make use of the wind that is a constant feature, especially in places like Ireland. The government has been fostering investments in wind power, with Nordex playing a vital role in supplying wind turbines for the UK energy market in recent years.

Nordex will supply up to 12 wind turbines for the Irish wind project

The German wind turbine manufacturer has an immensely impressive portfolio in the wind sector, providing turbines for a litany of projects not only in Europe, but further afield as well. Nordex will supply 12 N133/4.8 wind turbines at the Drumnahough Wind Farm in Donegal, Ireland, continuing its presence in the UK energy market for many years to come.

The Drumnahough project is just the latest in a long relationship between SSE and Nordex

The new Drumnahough project is just the latest for the long-standing relationship between SSE Renewables and Nordex, with the German manufacturer already supplying 29 turbines for the 101MW Yellow River wind farm in Offaly, Ireland. Additionally, the pair of companies recently announced a new order for wind turbines for a wind project in Spain.

“We’re pleased to have been awarded the contract to manufacture and install turbines for the Drumnahough Wind Farm – another important milestone in Ireland’s renewable energy journey. With the N133’s suitability for high wind locations and our long-term service commitment, at Nordex, we’re proud to continue to deliver as a trusted, dependable partner in the Irish onshore sector.” – Jason Welch, Managing Director UK & Ireland at the Nordex Group

Nordex will not only construct and install the 12 wind turbines at the Drumnahough project, but will also continue to provide substantial maintenance for the project as part of a long-term Premium Service agreement. The company has become the backbone of the international wind sector, and recently received an order for wind turbines for a wind project in Germany, exemplifying the company’s expertise in turbine manufacturing.

Once construction has been completed and the Drumnahough project is operational, it will potentially provide enough electricity to cover the power consumption of around 40,000 homes.

X-Energy Reactor Company, LLC, a developer of advanced nuclear reactor and fuel technologies, announced it has closed an oversubscribed Series D financing round of approximately $700 million led by Jane Street. X-energy expects to utilize proceeds from the round to help continue the expansion of its supply chain and commercial pipeline. (TRISO fuel element. Image: X-Energy)

Additional new investors include ARK Invest, Galvanize, Hood River Capital Management, Point72, Reaves Asset Management, XTX Ventures and various others, as well as existing investors including Ares Management funds, Corner Capital, Emerson Collective, NGP, Segra Capital Management and others.

Prior Funding Supports Current Development Efforts

X Energy, LLC in April 2024 awarded a $148.5 million tax credit for the construction by its wholly-owned subsidiary, TRISO-X LLC an advanced nuclear fuel fabrication facility, TX-1, in Oak Ridge, TN. Funded by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, the award is part of the Qualifying Advanced Energy Project Tax Credit program jointly administered by the U.S. Department of Energy, the U.S. Department of the Treasury, and the Internal Revenue Service.

In addition to ARDP funding, the U.S. Department of Energy also awarded X-energy $9 million in 2018 to support the initial design of the company’s fuel fabrication facility that later evolved into TX-1.

TRISO-X anticipates regulatory approval from the NRC by May 2026 and recently received approval from the Department to spend an additional $30 million to secure long-lead procurement items to adhere to the overall project schedule.

In October 2024 X-Energy Reactor Company, LLC announced a Series C-1 financing round of approximately $500 million, anchored by Amazon.com, Inc. Citadel Founder and CEO Ken Griffin, affiliates of Ares Management Corporation (Ares), NGP, and the University of Michigan join Amazon’s Climate Pledge Fund in the financing round.

The investment will help meet growing energy demands by funding the completion of X-energy’s reactor design and licensing as well as the first phase of its TRISO-X fuel fabrication facility.

X-energy and Amazon plan to establish and standardize a deployment and financing model to develop projects in partnership with infrastructure and utility partners. The investment includes manufacturing capacity to develop the SMR equipment to support more than five gigawatts of new nuclear energy projects utilizing X-energy’s technology.

The efforts will help meet growing energy demands in key locations through direct project investments and long-term power purchase agreements to help power Amazon operations.

Order Book Pipeline

X- Energy has plans to build four of its 80 MW HTGR design SMRs at the DOW Seadrift Operations manufacturing site located on the Texas Gulf Coast. X-energy has received updates from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission regarding the construction permit application for the initial deployment of the Xe-100 advanced reactor. The proposed project is being developed by The Dow Chemical Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Long Mott Energy LLC.

Citing the completeness and quality of the application, and the effectiveness of pre-application engagements, the NRC published an 18-month review timeline for the Texas Gulf Coast project and will concurrently proceed with its environmental assessment. Since 2018, X-energy has led and participated in extensive pre-application engagements with NRC staff on the Xe-100 design, TRISO-X fuel, and topical reports covering numerous aspects of the company’s technology

Another deal is to build up to five and as many as 12 of the SMRs for Amazon at a site adjacent to the Columbia Generating Station in Washington by the end of the 2030s. The reactor is operated by Energy Northwest. The utility has signed an MOU to operate the SMRs once they are built.

In Washington, Amazon’s agreement with Energy Northwest, a consortium of state public utilities, will enable the development of four advanced SMRs. The reactors will be constructed, owned and operated by Energy Northwest, and are expected to generate 320 MW of capacity for the first phase of the project, with the option to increase to 960 MW total.

Additionally, X-energy is partnered with British multinational energy and services company Centrica to deploy 6 GW in the United Kingdom. The project includes plans to build up to 12 of the 80 MW HTGR SMRs. Centrica will provide initial project capital for development with the goal of initiating full-scale activities in 2026.

Subject to regulatory approval in the U.K., the first electricity generation would be expected in the mid-2030s. Centrica and X-energy are in discussions with additional potential equity partners, as well as leading global engineering and construction companies, with the goal of establishing a UK-based development company to develop this first and subsequent projects.

Fuel Fabrication Plant Under Construction in Oak Ridge, TN

X-energy is building an advanced nuclear fuel fabrication facility in Oak Ridge, TN, to manufacture its proprietary TRISO-X fuel. Earlier this month X-energy announced the start of vertical construction for its $300 million TX-1 fuel fabrication facility. The facility will manufacture the company’s proprietary TRISO fuel for its commercial reactors.

Located within the Horizon Center Industrial Park, the 110-acre TRISO-X campus is situated on land that was formerly part of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory and was part of a tract released in 1996 for private development to help diversify the region’s economic base. TRISO-X acquired the campus from the Oak Ridge Industrial Development Board in 2022.

TX-1 will be the first of two facilities planned for the site to fabricate the company’s ceramic fuel designed to withstand extreme temperatures and retain fission products under all reactor conditions.

The fuel will be enriched to 19.5% U235. TRISO-X utilizes more energy dense high assay low enriched uranium (HALEU) that allows for longer periods of operation. X-Energy manufacturs a proprietary product to enrure supply and quality control.

The group will start building the shell of the 214,812 square foot facility at the Oak Ridge site that will be used to fabricate 700,000 TRISO fuel pebbles each year, which is enough fuel for 11 Xe-100 small modular reactors. X-Energy said full employment at the plant will be 500 people.

TRISO-X acquired the campus from the Oak Ridge Industrial Development Board in 2022.

First Allocation of HALEU from DOE

In April 2025 X-energy and its wholly owned subsidiary TRISO-X LLC announced an allocation of High-Assay Low-Enriched Uranium from the U.S. Department of Energy Office of Nuclear Energy’s HALEU Allocation Program.

“This first allocation is a critical step forward to bridge the HALEU availability gap in the nuclear supply chain with existing material,” said TRISO-X president Joel Duling.

“Coupled with the HALEU Availability Program and other efforts, we expect the commercial sector to further bridge the availability gap to support the delivery and scalability of the advanced reactor fleet.”

The allocation is part of X-energy’s participation in DOE’s Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program and will be delivered in the first core loads of fuel in partnership with Dow Inc. at their UCC Seadrift Operations manufacturing site.

The two companies recently announced the submission of a construction permit application to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for the proposed Xe-100 plant at Seadrift, with the potential to begin construction later this decade and start up early next decade.

X-Energy TRISO Fuel Irradiation Testing Underway at INL

Pebbles of TRISO-X fuel have begun 13 months of irradiation testing at Idaho National Laboratory to evaluate fuel performance across operating scenarios and qualify them for commercial use. Over a 13-month trial, the experiments will evaluate fuel performance under different power levels, temperatures and burnup scenarios, which are essential for meeting Nuclear Regulatory Commission standards for commercial use in advanced reactors, including X-energy’s Xe-100 small modular reactor. Once testing is complete, post-irradiation examination will begin at INL and Oak Ridge National Laboratory.

Vattenfall Invests $42 Million in New Nuclear for Sweden

Up to five small modular reactors being planned for existing Ringhals site

(NucNet) Swedish state-owned power company Vattenfall and the industrial consortium Industrikraft have signed an agreement for joint investment and collaboration that will enable the next steps in a project to deploy new nuclear power in Sweden.

Vattenfall said in a statement that Industrikraft will become a 20% shareholder in the nuclear project company Videberg Kraft and invest $42 million in the project.

Vattenfall and Industrikraft, formed in June 2024 to support the expansion of Swedish non-fossil fuel electricity supply, will work on the deployment of small modular reactors (SMRs) at Vattenfall’s existing Ringhals nuclear site on the Värö Peninsula, southwest Sweden.

The agreement covers project management and selection of technologies. Vattenfall said Swedish technology has a role to play in driving the development of a strong supplier cluster in Europe.

In August Vattenfall said it will proceed with US-based GE Vernova (GEV) and British company Rolls-Royce SMR as it looks to choose a potential supplier for new nuclear power plants next to Ringhals.

Vattenfall said at the time final investment decisions will be made “later in the process”.

It said both companies offer SMRs with proven technology and simplified designs that have integrated learnings from previous nuclear projects worldwide. Both use fuel for which Vattenfall has established supply chains.

GEV’s technology is the 300-MW BWRX-300. Construction of the first BWRX-300 unit is underway at Ontario Power Generation’s Darlington nuclear site near Toronto in Canada.

Rolls-Royce SMR is developing a 470-MW unit. The company has been selected by the British government as the preferred bidder to develop SMRs for the UK.

Vattenfall is planning a project with either five BWRX-300 plants for a total capacity of 1,500 MW or three Rolls-Royce SMR plants for 1,410 MW.

The company also said it is already looking at the next step to build an additional 1,000 MW of SMR capacity at the Ringhals site, where two large-scale reactors are in operation and two have been permanently shut down.

The company said building a series of smaller units as opposed to single, large-scale reactors, brings clear cost advantages. SMRs require less space, need significantly fewer personnel, and lead to more manageable logistics.

Dutch Government Prepares To Build Four New Nuclear Reactors

The incoming Dutch government has backed plans to more than triple the funds earmarked for the expansion of the nuclear sector. This plan would bring the total planned investments in the nuclear sector up from $4.9 billion to $15.2 billion, marking a significant increase in funding.

The Dutch government has started the assessment process for two new nuclear projects, with Borssele and Eemshaven being designated as possible locations for the new nuclear facilities. The government said its involvement in the nuclear plans is preferable to private sector investment due to the uncertain nature of nuclear projects including schedule and cost issues.

In December 2022 the Dutch government chose the Borssele site as its preferred location for the proposed construction of two new 1,000 MW+ nuclear units.

The government said the units should be deployed by 2035, each have a capacity of between 1,000 MW and 1,650 MW, and use Generation III+ reactor technology.

Earlier this year, the Dutch government established the Nuclear Energy Organization Netherlands (NEO NL) to facilitate the construction of the planned new nuclear power plants, marking a long-term involvement and commitment from the state. The new organization will be responsible for the entire process of developing the nation’s nuclear new reactors.

The government said it is considering two nuclear facilities to include small modular reactors, or SMRs, as they are significantly cheaper to construct, install, and operate than a larger conventional nuclear reactor. This would be a first for the European continent, as it has no small modular reactors in operation in the EU.

Japan Will Offer Loans to Finance Nuclear Power Projects

Government-backed loans would work with private investment as Tokyo backs reactors

(NucNet) Japan will introduce a loan support program to aid public investment in nuclear power plants and major transmission projects. The news was confirmed by the Tokyo-based industry group the Japan Atomic Industrial Forum (JAIF), which said that under the plan loans would be provided through the government’s Organization for Cross-Regional Coordination of Transmission Operators.

The loans would be granted as co-financing agreements between private institutions and the state, with the government recognizing its part in supporting the development of nuclear power projects.

JAIF said that Japan had been encouraged to follow the path of other governments which provide loan guarantees and other public investment to ensure that nuclear projects were viable and spread the risk more equitably.

At a press conference Ryosei Akazaka, Japan’s Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI), said, “With electricity demand expected to grow, we will take a hard look at whether private financing alone is sufficient for large-scale investments in decarbonized power sources and transmission networks.”

“We intend to deepen discussions on institutional frameworks and legal amendments that make effective use of the government’s creditworthiness.”

Japan’s new prime minister Sanae Takaechi has publicly supported the revival of nuclear power, with the aim of reducing the country’s reliance on fuel imports.

At present, 14 of the country’s 33 commercially available nuclear power plants have been restarted following the 2011 Fukushima disaster. The government plans to restart additional reactors and finish several that were under construction at the time of the 2011 Fukushima disaster.

Asian Development Bank to Invest in Nuclear Energy

The multilateral development bank has amended its energy policy, paving the way for it to support developing member countries that choose to pursue nuclear power.

(WNN & IAEA) The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) signed a new agreement on 11/25/25 to strengthen cooperation in support of countries across Asia and the Pacific that are exploring nuclear energy as part of their long-term energy and development strategies. Discussions will include identifying potential projects for collaboration, including those involving small modular reactors.

The agreement was signed by the IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi and the ADB President Masato Kanda in Manila, Philippines at a meeting of the the ADB’s Board of Directors. The Board revised its energy policy to support nuclear power, including investment measures for the first time as a pathway for decarbonization.

As part of the new policy, it has signed an agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to cooperate in supporting countries in Asia and the Pacific who are exploring nuclear energy as part of their energy and development strategies.

The Asian Development Bank’s move to consider funding nuclear energy projects follows a similar one between the IAEA and the World Bank earlier this year.

Asian Development Bank (ADB) President Masato Kanda said: “These changes further enhance ADB’s ability to support countries in Asia and the Pacific as they work to meet their rapidly growing energy needs. Nuclear power, for example, is an important technology option for countries looking for reliable alternatives to baseload electricity.”

“With ADB’s updated energy policy recognizing nuclear power as an alternative to fossil fuels for baseload generation, this agreement ensures that developing member countries choosing this path do so with robust safeguards, strong governance and a clear commitment to sustainability.”

IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi, who attended the announcement with Kanda, said, “As ADB opens the door to financing nuclear power, we will move quickly to identify practical areas of collaboration that respond to rising energy needs of countries across the region … our teams will now begin shaping concrete initiatives that deliver reliable, low-carbon energy and strengthen resilience for millions of people.”

“It further broadens that international momentum, strengthening support for countries that are turning to nuclear energy to enhance energy access, security and resilience”.

The memorandum of understanding with the IAEA will see the two “collaborate to build knowledge and technical capacity across the full nuclear life cycle. Key areas of cooperation include energy planning, the management of nuclear fuel cycles and radioactive waste, and nuclear facilities’ life-cycle management. The IAEA will also support informed decision-making by providing guidance on safety, security, safeguards, and stakeholder engagement.”

Founded in 1966 and owned by 69 member states, including 50 from the region, ADB committed $3.8 billion to energy projects in 2024. It says it aims to support “inclusive, resilient, and sustainable growth across Asia and the Pacific.”

General Atomics Completes Concept for New Fast Reactor Design

The fast modular reactor (FMR) design is one of three early-stage concept projects the Department of Energy supported under its Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program.

General Atomics has demonstrated feasibility of their fast modular reactor (FMR) design through various modeling and lab-scale tests to verify the performance of key safety systems, fuel, and operations — allowing the firm to start maturing the technology to a preliminary design phase for potential demonstration in the 2030s. Completed work also included the fabrication of sample fuel rods that match the design intended for use in the FMR.

The company is developing a gas-cooled modular reactor that can be made in factories and assembled on-site to deliver 44 MW as little as 0.2 acres of land.

The reactor is designed to pair with an air-cooling system for potential deployment in remote or arid locations and runs on silicon carbide-wrapped high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU) fuel that can withstand temperatures twice as high as fuel claddings currently used in light-water reactors.

The FMR’s conceptual design work was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy through an Advanced Reactor Concepts 2020 (ARC-20) award, part of the Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program.

Funding supported General Atomics’ strategic partnerships with other companies, academia and national laboratories to successfully verify the technical feasibility of the FMR design, helping to progress the advanced reactor design in its early phase.

Dr. Christina Back, Vice President of General Atomics said, “The ARC-20 program has supported critical advances in the gas-cooled fast reactor concept and demonstration of robust materials that enable an added layer of safety, while still enabling operation without the need for a water source. These features facilitate siting and compatibility for small communities and diverse applications, including the recycling of used nuclear fuel.”

What’s Next?

General Atomics has submitted their Principal Design Criteria and the Quality Assurance Plan Description licensing documents to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). The NRC also docketed several pre-application FMR documents that will be referenced in the future license application when General Atomics submits future formal licensing documents.

The proposed Fast Modular Reactor (FMR) is designed to generate 44 megawatts of firm electricity. The system utilizes silicon carbide-wrapped high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU) fuel.

With the completion of the conceptual design, General Atomics is moving to the preliminary design phase. Future planned activities include safety-related testing, and work to further develop fuel, materials, and power conversion system components. Work will lead to the final design phase, which will include construction, non-nuclear tests, and receiving HALEU for fuel fabrication.

The prototypes of the FMR fuel rods fabricated during the conceptual design process are undergoing irradiation testing at Idaho National Laboratory to experimentally verify their integrity.

This technology, referred to as SiGA, utilizes a silicon carbide composite material intended to form the basis of fuel rods capable of withstanding temperatures exceeding the limits of currently used materials. The multilayer composite cladding structure is designed to provide high-temperature resilience for both current and future reactor systems.

Westinghouse And Google Partner Using AI To Speed Up Nuclear Construction

Early pilot of technology shows significant time and cost savings

(NucNet) Westinghouse announced a partnership with Google Cloud to develop a custom AI-powered platform using specialized models that help optimize and accelerate the construction of nuclear power plants. Google said in a statement that early pilots of the platform have shown significant time and cost savings. The companies are also exploring ways for AI to help enhance nuclear operations and safety.

The core AI innovation targets the construction process, which historically represent 60% of reactor costs. Until recently, construction management relied on spreadsheets and paper documents, leading to delays that cascaded across thousands of interdependent tasks. Westinghouse turned decades of documentation to its advantage by loading them into an AI application.

The new AI system combines the companies’ AI models and prediction tools with Westinghouse’s WNEXUS, a 3D digital twin of its reactors. When combined with current and historic data, the system can predict bottlenecks, optimize construction task sequences, adjust staffing levels and account for external factors like supply chain constraints.

The optimization technology for new reactor construction is built using a “technology brick approach”, said Lou Martinez Sancho, Westinghouse’s chief technology officer and executive vice-president of R&D and innovation. He added that this means the technology has applications far beyond the initial project.

Google’s AI tools are being applied to reduce licensing processes and operations timing. By finding the fastest path through maintenance and refuelling tasks, the AI helps minimize reactor downtime.

Westinghouse CEO Dan Sumner has stressed that AI-driven decision-making optimization is essential to making nuclear power a viable investment for utilities and addressing energy urgency.

The company has already established its own proprietary AI infrastructure, Hive, designed specifically to meet the nuclear sector’s stringent regulatory and export-control frameworks. It also developed Bertha, a generative AI assistant that instantly accesses 75 years of nuclear knowledge and documentation at Westinghouse. The firm said that early use of the AI tools showed positive results in terms of reducing construction costs.

Google has increasingly looked towards nuclear energy as a key power source for its operations. In October, the company signed a 25-year Power Purchase Agreement with NextEra Energy to offtake power from its 615MW Duane Arnold Energy Center in Palo, Iowa. The agreement will support restarting the plant, which has been shuttered since 2020.

Raiford Smith, Google Cloud’s global director of Power & Energy, noted that energy now “underpins economic growth, data-center expansion and 24/7 carbon-free goals.”

Google has signed several nuclear energy deals. These include a 200 MW PPA with Commonwealth Fusion Systems for fusion power, a 50 MW PPA with SMR reactor firm Kairos Power, and a strategic agreement with Elementl Power to develop three nuclear energy projects in the US. The location and timing of these projects are still to be determined.",https://neutronbytes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/x-energy-triso-fuel_thumb.png,N,,2025-11-30 12:00:59.149004

Europe’s energy transition is largely powered by Chinese technology.
The gap is even starker in R&D, where the U.S. outinvested Europe by nearly €120 billion in 2023.
Chronic underinvestment, overregulation, deindustrialization, and fragmentation have left Europe’s defense industrial base too small, too slow, and incapable of meeting its security needs.
The world’s economic center of gravity has long since shifted away from Europe and the Atlantic toward the Indo-Pacific.","“Nothing grows in the shadow of great trees,” said the sculptor Constantin Brâncuși when he left his master, Rodin. He wasn’t rebelling for rebellion’s sake; he was claiming the space to become himself. He spoke of art, but he might as well have been speaking of today’s Europe.

Europe has long mistaken comfort for strength. Under the protective shelter of the United States, it outsourced its own defense, convinced that diplomacy and regulatory power could substitute for hard power. Under the seductive efficiency of China’s manufacturing engine, it outsourced its industrial backbone, trusting that access to cheap technology and components would last forever. And under the lure of Russian energy, it outsourced its security, mistaking abundant gas and oil for lasting leverage.

Europe’s energy transition is largely powered by Chinese technology. Over 98 percent of imported solar panels come from China, which also dominates the rare earth and magnet industry—controlling roughly 70 percent of global mine production, 90 percent of refining, and 94 percent of permanent magnet manufacturing. These materials are critical for everything from renewable energy to EVs and high-tech devices.

Europe is barely in the game when it comes to artificial intelligence, a competition dominated by two giants. In 2024, U.S.-based institutions produced forty notable AI models, compared with China’s fifteen and Europe’s three. The continent also relies heavily on major American companies for digital infrastructure and cloud services, as recent disruptions from an AWS server outage have shown. It has no hyperscalers of its own.

Moreover, red tape is choking tech development. The Draghi report mentions that the bloc has roughly 100 tech-focused laws and more than 270 regulators overseeing digital networks across all member states.

Defense isn’t much better. Reliance on the U.S. has hollowed out Europe’s capabilities, as the war in Ukraine has shown. Defense spending sits at just 1.9% of GDP in 2024. The gap is even starker in R&D, where the U.S. outinvested Europe by nearly €120 billion in 2023. The problem is not a shortage of know-how but of scale and strategic vision. Chronic underinvestment, overregulation, deindustrialization, and fragmentation have left Europe’s defense industrial base too small, too slow, and incapable of meeting its security needs.

The world’s economic center of gravity has long since shifted away from Europe and the Atlantic toward the Indo-Pacific. Home to more than half the planet’s population, nearly two-thirds of global GDP growth, and the world’s busiest trade routes, that region now anchors global security and prosperity.

Once, Venice was a great power. But when the center of gravity moved from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic, it failed to adapt and ended up as a city living off tourism and relics. Europe risks the same fate through a slow “Venetization” of its own. Unless it awakens, it too will become an open-air museum of its own past glories.

For as long as the Atlantic system dominated, Europe’s internal weaknesses—its fragmented market, sluggish productivity, sprawling bureaucracy, and energy dependence—remained hidden. But under the current geopolitical realities, those weaknesses are no longer manageable.

If Europe’s leaders fail to think strategically and in global competitive terms, the continent will fall even further behind. The pressure from Washington, particularly under Donald Trump, may be self-serving, but it also acts as a wake-up call. Europe can no longer afford to depend on others for its defense. The long shadow of the United States, especially since the end of the Cold War, has atrophied Europe’s strategic muscles and discouraged the growth of a competitive defense industry.

Economic dependence breeds political timidity. A continent that relies on others for its energy, technology, and critical resources cannot claim real independence. As Mario Draghi warned, Europe’s maze of regulations, fragmented markets, and chronic underinvestment are stifling its ability to compete. Europe survived every storm since the Cold War, but it lets others decide which way the wind blows.

Europe must take tough decisions. That means making choices that often seem politically impossible within the short cycles of national politics: pooling defense capabilities, building genuine capital markets, investing jointly in next-generation technologies, and accepting that sovereignty shared among Europeans is stronger than sovereignty borrowed from others.

Europe now needs a new “whatever it takes” moment, not to save its currency, but to save its future. It must find the courage to think and act on its own terms, to grow and compete on its own strength rather than rely on others for protection, power, or purpose.

Constantin Brâncuși left Auguste Rodin’s studio despite his admiration for the master. Europe now faces the same moment of truth. It is more a question of will rather than means. It can either cling to a fading shelter, protected, supplied, and slowly diminished, or step into the light and learn to stand on its own. Stepping into the light does not mean turning its back on its allies, but standing tall beside them.",https://moderndiplomacy.eu/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/european-union.jpg,N,,2025-11-30 11:01:02.343241

The European continent has been embracing the renewable energy market with open arms in recent years, with Italy serving the global hydrogen demand that has emerged over the past few years. The all-new decade-long agreement between the two companies sets the stage for a long and prosperous project in Italy.

Italy’s Hydrogen Valley Rosignano Project is reaching a new milestone

The renewable energy sector has been growing at an astonishing rate in recent years as more nations around the world finally accept the realization that the generational reliance on fossil fuel-based energy production needs to come to an end. Climate change has become so severe that it has devastated numerous regions of the world, so something needs to change. Up steps hydrogen power to save the day, hopefully.

To combat climate change, several nations are turning to the renewable energy market to decarbonize their energy markets. In that regard, Italy is progressing in its plans to develop the Hydrogen Valley Rosignano Project by enabling Solvay and Sapio to enter into a 10-year deal to develop renewable hydrogen for the project, marking a turning point in the European hydrogen dream.

Solvay’s Rosignano site is set to receive significant support from Sapio’s solar expertise

The new agreement calls for Solvay to construct a new 5 MW electrolysis plant, while Solvay will install a 10 MW solar photovoltaic system to provide the site with the required power. With the expected completion date set for mid-2026, the project is expected to produce approximately 756 tonnes of renewable hydrogen, marking a 15% reduction in CO₂ emissions at the site.

The new project was officially launched in November this year

At a groundbreaking ceremony attended by the most prominent officials in the Italian energy sector, the energy firms highlighted the importance the project will play in Italy’s clean energy transition and emission reduction ambitions. Italy has been working exceedingly hard in recent years to fast-track any projects that may enable the energy transition to renewable power.

The green hydrogen produced on-site will supply Solvay’s peroxide manufacturing operations, which serve a multitude of sectors across the world. The partnership exemplifies the cooperative nature of the global energy market as nations aim to boost investments in the renewable energy market. Europe’s positive sentiment for renewable energy projects has become all too evident in recent months.

“Our partnership with Sapio represents a good example in how we enhance our global peroxide operations. This project is a key part of our broader strategy to support essential industries – from electronics and water treatment to energy and food safety – with more sustainable solutions. – Carlos Silveira, President of Solvay Peroxides’ business

Building on the statement from Solvay’s leadership, Sapio’s CEO noted that “We are extremely proud of our collaboration with Solvay: this project, funded by the National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP).”

“There is a demand pull that gives investors optimism,” said Adam Stein, director of nuclear energy innovation at the Breakthrough Institute, which seeks an expansion of nuclear power.
Its effort to license a new form of nuclear energy technology failed during the Biden administration.
“You would get acute radiation syndrome,” said Nick Touran, a nuclear reactor physicist, who called Valar out on X.
There are people who are building nuclear reactors on time, on budget in the world today.”","The fledgling Texas company Fermi America has yet to produce an electron, split an atom or survive the torturous gantlet of regulatory and manufacturing obstacles required to build a nuclear reactor.

But investors are betting big that the Trump administration will help Fermi turn from a glossy, aspirational marketing brochure into a cutting-edge nuclear operation to meet the rapacious energy needs of AI data centers. So much so that they catapulted its founders into the ranks of the world’s richest men a few months after Fermi filed paperwork with regulators to build the “Donald J. Trump Advanced Energy and Intelligence Campus.”

Typically, a company’s revenue, track record and market advantage drive valuations. But in the age of President Donald Trump’s promised nuclear revival, shareholders and backers see connections to the White House as the road to profitability, investment analysts and longtime industry insiders say.

Fermi was founded by three men: Rick Perry, who served as Texas governor and was U.S. energy secretary during Trump’s first term; Perry’s investor son; and the son of a former Texas congressman celebrated by the right when he founded an “anti-woke” bank that later failed.

“If you or I launched the same business, our valuation would be zero,” said Raphaëlle d’Ornano, whose firm Decoding Discontinuity advises investors on AI-related start-ups.

Fermi’s corporate blueprint, d’Ornano said, essentially signals to investors “we have no proven execution capabilities in this field but what we do have is a team of politically connected people who make us believe attaining the needed regulatory clearance should not be too much of a problem.”

Fermi is not an outlier. Other Trump-connected companies with untested business plans are brimming with cash infusions and winning regulators’ favor.

They include the advanced reactor developer Oklo, where Energy Secretary Chris Wright was a board member; General Matter, a uranium enrichment start-up where former Trump megadonor and adviser Peter Thiel is a board director and funder; and Valar Atomics, a small California reactor company backed by major Trump donor Palmer Luckey and Shyam Sankar, the chief technology officer of Palantir Technologies, a firm closely aligned with the White House. Some of the companies are leapfrogging past far more seasoned firms.

“They assume there is something shiny, new and fancy just waiting for a Steve Jobs of nuclear,” said Chris Keefer, co-founder of Canadians for Nuclear Energy. “It is creating valuations that are probably wildly out of touch with what these companies are capable of.”

Energy Department officials said nuclear approvals are subject to rigorous regulatory review. They referred questions about the firms’ political connections to the White House, which declined to answer them.

These firms are far from the only ones working on advances in nuclear power. BWXT, a longtime military contractor, is developing new small commercial reactors. Industry leader Westinghouse recently signed an $80 billion deal with the Trump administration to build large legacy reactors across the nation. Even relative newcomer TerraPower, an advanced reactor firm founded by Bill Gates, is further along than other start-ups, having broken ground for a commercial plant in Wyoming.

Some in the industry say investor excitement makes sense as dozens of new firms compete to meet AI’s exploding need for power.

“There is a demand pull that gives investors optimism,” said Adam Stein, director of nuclear energy innovation at the Breakthrough Institute, which seeks an expansion of nuclear power. “The market sees companies close to the administration as having the best chance for success, as would be the case in any administration.”

The start-ups chafe at the characterization that they’re merely trading on connections.

“Ask the world’s leading investors and potential customers who watch our site via satellite, and they will tell you they marvel at what we’ve already accomplished,” Fermi CEO Toby Neugebauer, son of former congressman Randy Neugebauer, R-Texas, said in an interview.

Neugebauer, a GOP megadonor who lives in a home styled after the White House, is referring to a large patch of land near Amarillo where the company hopes to have reactors operating by 2032, a timeline experts say is unheard of, and has already started building gas plants to generate additional power.

He said he has hired highly accomplished nuclear executives and argued that some of the nation’s most complicated energy undertakings were launched by small groups of entrepreneurs.

The combined net worth on paper of Toby Neugebauer and his father – a major investor in Fermi – surged to $5 billion when he and the Perrys took their company public nine months after forming it. Griffin Perry, the son of the former Texas governor, saw his net worth grow to $2 billion, according to Forbes. Their fortunes have since fluctuated with the stock price.

Oklo is another darling of Wall Street speculators, despite zero revenue and no licensed reactors. Its effort to license a new form of nuclear energy technology failed during the Biden administration.

After Trump invited Oklo co-founder Jacob DeWitte to join him in the Oval Office for the signing of executive orders boosting companies developing advanced reactors, the firm’s stock surged.

Oklo, with its 188 employees, at times last month was valued higher than industry powerhouse BWXT, a nearly 10,000-employee company that has sold hundreds of reactors to the military over many decades.

DeWitte and co-founder Caroline DeWitte, his wife, are also on the Forbes list of billionaires now. The couple cashed out $90 million in Oklo stock this year, cementing some of those paper gains.

“If we look at all of Oklo’s insider activities, there is little to no purchasing of stock,” said Michael Seely, an industry consultant who advises investors on nuclear firms. “It is all selling, at somewhat regular intervals. If you were confident the company will succeed, you would not be doing that.”

DeWitte said in an interview that the stock sales were scheduled before the firm’s valuation surged, as part of the couple’s plan to unload a set amount of shares at fixed times. He said investors value firms like his higher than legacy government contractors because Oklo is oriented toward solutions for energy needed for AI data centers.

BWXT, he said, “doesn’t necessarily have the same pace and rate of growth opportunity that I think investors are expecting and seeing from groups, like us, that are facing a lot more towards the AI side.”

BWXT does not agree. “BWXT has built an unmatched reputation in the nuclear industry through delivery, including the production of fuel and components for more than 420 nuclear reactors,” Joe Miller, who leads its government operations, said in an email.

Wright has forfeited his interest in Oklo and, according to DOE, recuses himself from decisions involving the company. But Oklo’s White House ties remain strong: Interior Secretary Doug Burgum traveled to Idaho Falls in September to help Oklo break ground for a pilot plant.

The Trump administration has fast-tracked some start-ups that are cagey about technologies or reviving designs that sputtered previously.

The uranium enrichment company General Matter has not even disclosed which process it would use to enrich uranium. Yet, after its April public launch, the firm won a valuable federal land lease in Paducah, Kentucky, where enrichment took place during the Cold War. Company officials say they briefed regulators on their technology but do not share that information publicly “due to security concerns,” an unusual position in the industry.

General Matter has yet to build anything but is now thought by company officials and competitors to be a front-runner to receive subsidies valued at as much as $900 million to construct enrichment operations, over competing bids by established firms that have already completed large-scale projects.

General Matter CEO Scott Nolan was one of only three nuclear executives, along with Oklo’s DeWitte and the CEO of Constellation Energy, invited to join Trump in the Oval Office when he signed executive orders in May and hailed a nuclear “renaissance.”

Newcomer Valar Atomics, where company leaders wear “Make Nuclear Great Again” hats, is partnering with DOE and Utah to build a test reactor there. It was selected, along with Oklo, for a federal program to help companies make fuel needed for next-generation reactors.

Valar’s 26-year-old CEO, Isaiah Taylor, was the subject of a July feature in the American Conservative, where he praised the current administration and attacked earlier energy policy as being driven by the left’s misguided climate obsessions. Three years ago, he wrote on LinkedIn that he was destined to build several multibillion-dollar companies.

Valar declares on a company webpage that “holding the spent fuel from [its] system for five minutes gives the equivalent radiation exposure to receiving a CAT scan.” Nuclear engineers were appalled by his claims.

“You would get acute radiation syndrome,” said Nick Touran, a nuclear reactor physicist, who called Valar out on X. “You would have a fatal dose within seconds. The gamma rays kill enough of your cells – white blood cells first – that your body loses ability to have an immune system and you would die a quite painful death in a couple of weeks.”

Taylor released company data to back the safety claim, but other engineers said it only bolstered Touran’s criticism. Taylor promised further explanation in a post on X, but it never came. Valar did not respond to requests for comment.

DOE said in its statement that all the firms selected for its pilot reactor program, including Valar, passed rigorous safety reviews.

Longtime nuclear proponents are bewildered to see firms that publicly have shared only vague safety plans and engineering blueprints getting expedited approvals.

Keefer, the Canadian nuclear energy advocate, warned that investors in these firms risk a major reckoning. Oklo, for instance, is trying to make commercially viable a new type of reactor that Keefer said even the government of China, with its advantages in nuclear energy, has struggled to make pencil out despite 15 years of effort.

In fact, during the Biden administration, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission found a similar Oklo reactor plan inadequate.

“It’s not like the NRC asks for an extraordinary amount of information,” said a former nuclear official who was involved in reviewing Oklo’s failed application and spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid jeopardizing their work in the industry. “The NRC asks three questions: What is the worst that can happen, what are the systems, structures and components in your reactor that prevents that from happening, and how do you know that?”

“Oklo would only answer them at a very high level,” the person said. “They wanted to say nothing bad can happen to our reactor.”

DeWitte said Oklo had planned a robust public rebuttal but claims that at the time, NRC officials “threatened us, in a retributional way, not to issue a response letter to correct the record.”

“Well, they’re gone now,” he added.

Scott Burnell, an NRC spokesman, did not respond to the allegation. In an email, he referred to the agency’s official denial letter and said the agency is working with Oklo on a new application.

DeWitte argues the company is well positioned to demonstrate that its test reactor is capable of creating electricity as soon as next summer. But he acknowledged building turnkey reactors that can produce sustained, uninterrupted electricity could take years longer.

The Trump administration is working to help companies such as Oklo succeed by changing safety reviews in ways that unnerve many safety advocates.

Some of the independent agency’s traditional safety reviews for projects such as Oklo’s reactor will be handled instead by the Energy Department, which is led by political appointees. The NRC and the administration signed an agreement in October saying that safety “risks that have already been addressed in DOE review” will not be revisited by the NRC.

Burnell said in his email that if DOE “thoroughly tests a reactor design and shows it operates safely, the NRC will build on that work, not repeat it.”

Even so, several conservative states have joined Valar and other nuclear start-ups in suing the NRC, arguing that the federal agency has overstepped its authority by regulating smaller nuclear reactors the companies claim are inherently safe. The plaintiffs say licensing for such plants should be left to the states. The agency declined to comment on the lawsuit.

For its part, Fermi argues it can build the same type of reactors already operating across the country – but do it exponentially cheaper and faster. Since modern safety standards were established in the 1970s, even the most experienced developers have not met anything close to Fermi’s timeline to have a reactor turned on by 2032.

The last such reactors were seven years behind schedule and $7 billion over budget by the time they went online in Georgia in 2023. South Carolina utilities burned through $9 billion before scrapping a similar project, and executives involved were later convicted of making false promises to investors.

Skeptics caution that Fermi could be destined for the same fate as Neugebauer’s last buzzy start-up, Glorifi. The bank, which promoted credit cards made out of bullet casings and homeowner’s insurance discounts for gun owners, went bankrupt and landed in the “Museum of Failure,” a traveling collection of entrepreneurial “failures and mistakes.”

Neugebauer said Glorifi inspired other “anti-woke” financial firms and is “the crowning achievement of my career.” He is adamant, though, that Fermi will succeed.

“We’re not playing the Washington game,” he said. “We’re playing the let’s-go-build-these-with-people-who’ve-done-it game. There are people who are building nuclear reactors on time, on budget in the world today.”",https://thumb.spokesman.com/5j2YS-6mJNyRTfN7QtQFjka0_BA=/1200x630/smart/media.spokesman.com/photos/2025/11/27/6928ea1e6bbd1.hires.jpg,N,,2025-11-30 11:01:45.068194

Household-battery startup Base Power Inc. raised $1 billion to expand its energy-storage business and build a manufacturing plant in Texas.

The Series C funding round led by venture capital firm Addition included other existing investors such as Lightspeed Venture Partners, Andreessen Horowitz and Altimeter, the company said in a statement Wednesday. Base Power, co-founded by entrepreneur Zach Dell, will use the proceeds to boost energy-storage production.

“We’re building domestic manufacturing capacity for fixing the grid,” Chief Operating Officer Justin Lopas said. “This factory in Austin is our first, and we’re already planning for our second.”

Battery companies are expanding in the US as the need to support the nation’s aging power grid grows amid rising electricity demand from data centers and widening electrification of the economy.

Base installs residential backup power systems at a fraction of the cost of traditional natural gas- or propane-fueled generators. Under Dell’s business model, the batteries are charged when local electricity prices are low.

But during high-demand periods, such as heat waves or cold snaps, Base can tap a portion of those stored electrons to capture price differentials while ensuring each homeowner retains ample spare electricity to avoid power blips or blackouts.

The new facility will enable Base to “build our own hardware to meet surging demand and scale nationwide,” Dell wrote in a post on X. “This is a key step in putting a battery on every home in the country.”

“I told all of them, elect a Democrat, and your bills will go up some more.” Data centers have been a prominent issue in Atlanta’s rural exurbs.","As loyal Republicans, Reece Payton said that he and his family of cattle ranchers in Hogansville, Ga., had one thing on their minds when they cast their ballots in November for the state’s utility board — “to make a statement.”

They were already irked by their escalating electric bills, not to mention an extra $50 a month levied by their local utility to cover a new nuclear power plant more than 200 miles away. But after they heard a data center might be built next to their Logos Ranch, about 60 miles southwest of Atlanta, they had enough of Republicans who seemed far too receptive to the interests of the booming artificial intelligence industry.

“That’s the first time I ever voted Democrat,” Mr. Payton, 58, said.

Message sent.

In some of Georgia’s reddest and most rural counties, Republicans crossed party lines this month and helped propel two Democrats, Peter Hubbard and Alicia Johnson, to landslide upsets, ousting the incumbent candidates on the Georgia Public Service Commission. No Democrat has served on the five-person commission, which regulates utilities and helps set climate and energy policy, since 2007.

Across the country, Democrats have seized on rising anxiety over electricity costs and data centers in what could be a template for the 2026 midterm elections.

In Virginia, Governor-elect Abigail Spanberger pledged during her campaign to lower energy bills and make data centers pay more. In the House of Delegates, one Democratic challenger unseated a Republican incumbent by focusing on curbing the proliferation of data centers in Loudoun County and the exurbs of the nation’s capital.

In New Jersey, Governor-elect Mikie Sherrill promised to declare a state of emergency on utility costs and freeze rates. And in Memphis, State Representative Justin J. Pearson, who is challenging Representative Steve Cohen in a high-profile Democratic primary next year, has vowed to fight a supercomputer by Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence company, xAI, that would be located in a predominantly Black neighborhood.

Strong opposition by citizens forced the Tucson City Council in August to pull the plug on an Amazon data center slated for that Arizona city, and then in September forced Google to call off one in Indianapolis.

“Electricity is the new price of eggs,” said Charles Hua, executive director of Powerlines, a nonpartisan organization which aims to modernize utility regulations and reduce power bills. “This is a defining moment for politicians of all stripes — what’s your answer to lowering utility bills? Because I think consumers and voters are looking for leadership on this.”

After meeting recently with Virginia legislators, Mr. Hua said he was struck by how “the nexus of data centers and utility bills actually came up very consistently.”

In 2022, a spike in natural gas prices following the Russian invasion of Ukraine fueled a rise in energy costs around the U.S. Utilities have also undertaken costly projects to modernize the power grid and improve the infrastructure to guard against extreme weather and absorb an anticipated surge in demand from data centers.

As the price of electricity has risen, more American customers have fallen behind on their utility bills, or have had their power cut off.

Georgia ranks 35th in energy affordability, in part because of cost overruns and delays associated with its new Plant Vogtle nuclear generators in Waynesboro, according to the American Legislative Exchange Council, an influential conservative policy group.

So it wasn’t a surprise when Attorney General Chris Carr and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger — candidates in the Republican primary to succeed term-limited Gov. Brian Kemp — called November’s results a referendum on affordability. “You’re a fool if you don’t recognize that,” Mr. Carr said.

Some Georgia Republicans have cautioned against reading too much into the 25-percentage-point losses suffered by the utility board incumbents, Tim Echols and Fitz Johnson.

This year’s elections stemmed from a 2020 federal lawsuit, which contended that the statewide elections for commission seats, which represent geographic districts, were unfair to Black voters. An appeals court eventually ruled against the plaintiffs, but the legal battle delayed the elections — setting the stage for November’s two races, the only statewide ones this year. (Two more utility seats will be contested in 2026.)

Democratic turnout was also boosted, Republicans said, by municipal elections in strongholds like Atlanta.

“I think it’s a complete anomaly,” State Senator Greg Dolezal said at a Republican event in Valdosta to tout his candidacy for lieutenant governor next year. Noting the comfortable margins racked up by President Trump in 2024 and Mr. Kemp in 2022, he added, “There’s no planet on which a 65-35 split is representative.”

One plaintiff in the lawsuit was Brionté McCorkle, executive director of Georgia Conservation Voters. She said the lawsuit enabled advocacy groups to develop a plan to help people “connect the dots” between the bills they were receiving and the commission’s role in approving six rate increases for Georgia Power, the state’s largest electric provider, over the last two years.

The group’s political action fund spent $2.3 million, sending half a million texts, plastering 92 billboards across the state and producing an anti-incumbent website.

That outreach made a difference, she said, pointing to Lowndes and Brooks counties on the Florida border. In previous races for federal and state offices going back to 2018, including the public service commission, Republicans won there by 20 points.

This year, Mr. Echols and Mr. Johnson each lost by 20 points.

At a weekly food pantry run by South Street Care House in Valdosta, Ga., where dozens of cars had lined up to receive a box full of fresh fruits, vegetables, breads and other staples, several people said they had heard about the election through texts and social media.

Barbara Lehman, 66, is typically a reliable Republican, but not this time, according to her daughter Angela and granddaughter Shelby, who were among those waiting for food.

“If the power companies want to expand their business, then that should be on them, not the consumer,” Ms. Lehman said in a text message. “Some people are just barely making it as it is.”

At the event attended by Mr. Dolezal and two other candidates for statewide offices, Gary McMillan, a former chair of the Lowndes County Republican Party, said that he, too, knew Republicans who bucked the party.

“They said my electric bills keep going up, and Republicans control the public service commission, and I’ve got a problem with that,” Mr. McMillan recounted. “I told all of them, elect a Democrat, and your bills will go up some more.”

Data centers have been a prominent issue in Atlanta’s rural exurbs. Mr. Trump wants to accelerate their growth in the battle for A.I. supremacy. At least 26 are under construction within 60 miles of Atlanta, and another 52 are planned.

But some Georgia Republicans — including Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, who is resigning her seat in January — have questioned the facilities’ use of resources. Some residents say local wells have been damaged, and the cost of municipal water has climbed.

Good Jobs First, a liberal group that tracks tax breaks for corporations, has said the state has done a poor job disclosing subsidies for data centers. The public service commission’s own staff has also warned that monthly residential bills could climb by $20 a month or more (a figure disputed by the utility) if the commission approves Georgia Power’s proposal to add almost 10,000 megawatts of power to accommodate data centers — the equivalent of nine nuclear reactors at Plant Vogtle.

Only one-third of that proposal should be approved, the staff recommended.

In Troup County on the Alabama border, the victorious Democratic utility candidates whittled 24-point romps enjoyed by the Republican candidates in 2020 and 2018 down to 10, thanks to voters like the Paytons.

The Paytons had never been to a Hogansville City Council meeting before they heard about a proposal to build a data center on 437 acres next to their ranch, and across from their Georgia Untamed Zoo, which houses animals like sloths and capybaras and is popular with school field trips. Now they’ve been to two, and counting.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/26/multimedia/00nat-electricity-politics-data-lvpw/00nat-electricity-politics-data-lvpw-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-11-30 10:02:14.379985

This agreement intends to strengthen federal-provincial collaboration in the energy sector to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, utilize Alberta’s energy resources, and create more careers for Canadians.

Per a Nov. 27 press release, Canada and Alberta will collaborate on multiple projects to build Canada’s economy and meet growing energy demands. It will advance the construction of Pathways Plus, reportedly the world’s largest carbon capture, utilisation, and storage project.

The agreement centres around a new pipeline to the British Columbia coast. The MOU states that upon receipt of a proposal from the Government of Alberta, the Government of Canada will provide an approval process under the Building Canada Act for the construction to be financed and constructed by the private sector, with Indigenous Peoples’ ownership and benefits. The pipeline would reportedly transport at least one million barrels per day to Asian markets as a priority.

“In the face of global trade shifts and profound uncertainty, Canada and Alberta are striking a new partnership to build a stronger, more sustainable, and more independent Albertan and Canadian economy. We will make Canada an energy superpower, drive down our emissions and diversify our export markets. We want to build big things, and we’re building bigger and faster together,” said Carney.

The MOU advances multiple clean energy projects including an industrial carbon pricing agreement for the province and an agreement to lower methane emissions by 75% over the next decade. Additional initiatives intend to enable Alberta to build nuclear power generation, reinforce the electricity grid to power AI data centres, and build large transmission interties with British Columbia and Saskatchewan.

The federal government states that these projects will only be built in consultation and partnership with Indigenous rights-holders and British Columbia. They will reportedly create opportunities for Indigenous co-ownership, partnership, and economic benefits.

“Canada is acting decisively to establish ourselves as a global energy superpower in the face of a changing world.

Balcony solar panels are now widespread in countries such as Germany – where more than 1m homes have them – but have until now been stymied in the US by state regulations.
A further five states could join the rush in the next few months, according to Kevin Chou, executive director of Bright Saver, a non-profit that champions the adoption of balcony solar panels.
The panels themselves are smaller than standard rooftop panels and can be zip-tied in place without professional installation.
In Utah, state legislator Raymond Ward was intrigued after reading about balcony solar and realized a minor adjustment to the law would allow Utahns to purchase the technology.","Acquiring solar panels at home can be an expensive hassle for people in the US. But small, simple, plug-in solar panels for use on balconies are soon to become available for millions of Americans, with advocates hoping the technology will quickly go mainstream.

Earlier this year, Utah became the first state in the country to pass legislation allowing people to purchase and install small, portable solar panels that plug into a standard wall socket.

When attached outside to the balcony or patio of a dwelling, such panels can provide enough power for residents to run free of charge, home appliances such as fridges, dishwashers, washing machines and wi-fi without spending money on electricity from the grid.

Balcony solar panels are now widespread in countries such as Germany – where more than 1m homes have them – but have until now been stymied in the US by state regulations. This is set to change, with lawmakers in New York and Pennsylvania filing bills to join Utah in adopting permission for the panels, with Vermont, Maryland and New Hampshire set to follow suit soon.

“Plug-in solar is a powerful tool to deliver enhanced energy independence and affordability to millions of New Yorkers who are currently shut out of the solar economy,” said Liz Krueger, a New York state senator who has sponsored a bill to allow balcony solar.

Krueger said that her tweak to state law will be “a gamechanger for renters, low-income New Yorkers, and many others who can’t install rooftop solar”.

A further five states could join the rush in the next few months, according to Kevin Chou, executive director of Bright Saver, a non-profit that champions the adoption of balcony solar panels.

“There’s now so much interest in this,” said Chou. “The federal administration has been so negative to clean energy that people have thought ‘OK what can we do at the state level?’ and this has been one of those things.

“There’s real momentum behind this now. In states where electricity is more expensive, in particular, I think we will see market forces really carry this far.”

As with solar panels that are attached to a building’s roof, or arrayed in fields, balcony solar soaks up the sun, albeit on a smaller scale. It then feeds this clean energy, via an inverter, into the wall socket. The panels themselves are smaller than standard rooftop panels and can be zip-tied in place without professional installation.

They sell for the equivalent of about $300 in Germany, with more expensive versions for $1,500 and upwards, that include some battery storage that can continue to feed in solar power to the home once the sun has vanished for the day.

All of this power is sufficient to run most home appliances for free, although it isn’t enough for larger family homes that have substantial air conditioning units or require charging for an electric vehicle.

“If you’re a single person living at home it can power all of your needs, but not for a family of six,” said Chou. “This isn’t a silver bullet or anything, it could maybe knock 5% off emissions. But it is an easy thing to do, it’s convenient and it can save people money. At the moment, there aren’t many wins happening for the climate and this can be one.”

A major barrier to balcony solar, though, has been the regulatory system across states, which typically requires anyone who installs solar panels to strike an agreement with the local utility for the power they are feeding back to the grid.

The installation of panels also typically has to be done by contractors and is inspected. This regime, plus inconsistent federal and state incentives for solar, means that only about 7% of US homes have rooftop solar, far less than some other countries. In Australia, for example, more than one in three households have rooftop solar.

In Utah, state legislator Raymond Ward was intrigued after reading about balcony solar and realized a minor adjustment to the law would allow Utahns to purchase the technology. His legislation carved out an exemption from interconnection agreements for people generating 1.2 kilowatt of power or less.

“The state law said that if you put any power back on the grid, even one electron, you need a contract with the utility, which is just crazy,” said Ward, who is a Republican.

“No one opposed the change. I fully expect 10 other legislatures in 2026 will run a bill like this, and more and more people will become interested in this. It will definitely happen.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/997e791ece5cc1681d149264ea11d93783969b69/898_0_4650_3721/master/4650.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ac0018441a7808c443a8b98f6e1d928b",N,,2025-11-30 10:02:18.629125

Allying With Nvidia Mr. Sacks opened the door of the White House to Silicon Valley leaders.
Mr. Sacks and Mr. Huang, who had not met before Mr. Sacks joined the administration, forged a tight bond this spring, said three people familiar with the men, who were not authorized to discuss their interactions.
The Sacks Portfolio The White House has praised Mr. Sacks, saying he minimized his financial conflicts of interest.
Mr. Sacks opened the event by describing his White House experience as “incredible” and hailing the administration’s work on A.I.","In July, David Sacks, one of the Trump administration’s top technology officials, beamed as he strode onstage at a neoclassical auditorium just blocks from the White House. He had convened top government officials and Silicon Valley executives for a forum on the booming business of artificial intelligence.

The guest of honor was President Trump, who unveiled an “A.I. Action Plan” that was drafted in part by Mr. Sacks, a longtime venture capitalist. In a nearly hourlong speech, Mr. Trump declared that A.I. was “one of the most important technological revolutions in the history of the world.” Then he picked up his pen and signed executive orders to fast-track the industry.

Almost everyone in the high-powered audience — which included the chief executives of the chipmakers Nvidia and AMD, as well as Mr. Sacks’s tech friends, colleagues and business partners — were poised to profit from Mr. Trump’s directives.

Among the winners was Mr. Sacks himself.

Since January, Mr. Sacks, 53, has occupied one of the most advantageous moonlighting roles in the federal government, influencing policy for Silicon Valley in Washington while simultaneously working in Silicon Valley as an investor. Among his actions as the White House’s artificial intelligence and crypto czar:

Mr. Sacks has offered astonishing White House access to his tech industry compatriots and pushed to eliminate government obstacles facing A.I. companies. That has set up giants like Nvidia to reap an estimate of as much as $200 billion in new sales.

Mr. Sacks has recommended A.I. policies that have sometimes run counter to national security recommendations, alarming some of his White House colleagues and raising questions about his priorities.

Mr. Sacks has positioned himself to personally benefit. He has 708 tech investments, including at least 449 stakes in companies with ties to artificial intelligence that could be aided directly or indirectly by his policies, according to a New York Times analysis of his financial disclosures.

His public filings designate 438 of his tech investments as software or hardware companies, even though the firms promote themselves as A.I. enterprises, offer A.I. services or have A.I. in their names, The Times found.

Mr. Sacks has raised the profile of his weekly podcast, “All-In,” through his government role, and expanded its business.

No event better illustrates Mr. Sacks’s ethical complexities and how his intertwined interests have come together than the July A.I. summit. Mr. Sacks initially planned for the forum to be hosted by “All-In,” which he leads with other tech investors. “All-In” asked potential sponsors to each pay it $1 million for access to a private reception and other events at the summit “bringing together President Donald Trump and leading A.I. innovators,” according to a proposal viewed by The Times.

The plan so worried some officials that Susie Wiles, the White House chief of staff, intervened to prevent “All-In"" from serving as the sole host of the forum, two people with knowledge of the episode said.

Steve Bannon, a former adviser to Mr. Trump and a critic of Silicon Valley billionaires, said Mr. Sacks was a quintessential example of ethical conflicts in an administration where “the tech bros are out of control.”

“They are leading the White House down the road to perdition with this ascendant technocratic oligarchy,” he said.

Mr. Sacks has been allowed to serve in government while working in private industry because he is a “special government employee,” a title the White House typically confers on experts who temporarily advise the government. He is not paid for his work for the administration.

But Mr. Sacks stands out as a special government employee because of his hundreds of investments in tech companies, which can benefit from policies that he influences. His public ethics filings, which are based on self-reported information, do not disclose the value of those remaining stakes in crypto and A.I.-related companies. They also omit when he sold assets he said he would divest, making it difficult to determine whether his government service has netted him profits.

A White House spokeswoman, Liz Huston, said Mr. Sacks had addressed potential conflicts. His insights were “an invaluable asset for President Trump’s agenda of cementing American technology dominance,” she said.

Jessica Hoffman, a spokeswoman for Mr. Sacks, said that “this conflict of interest narrative is false.” Mr. Sacks has complied with special government employee rules and the Office of Government Ethics determined that he should sell investments in certain types of A.I. companies but not others, she said. His government role has cost him, not benefited him, she added.

At a White House dinner for tech executives in September, Mr. Sacks said he was grateful to work in both technology and government. It was “a great honor to have a foot in each one of these worlds,” he said.

‘David’s House’

Mr. Sacks’s road to the White House began in Silicon Valley.

He arrived in the tech heartland in 1990 as an undergraduate at Stanford University, where he met fellow students including Peter Thiel. Mr. Sacks later joined Mr. Thiel at a start-up that became the electronic payments firm PayPal, alongside Elon Musk.

After eBay bought PayPal for $1.5 billion in 2002, the men invested in one another. Mr. Sacks helped fund Mr. Musk’s rocket company, SpaceX, as well as Palantir, the data analysis firm co-founded by Mr. Thiel. In turn, Mr. Thiel backed Yammer, Mr. Sacks’s business communications start-up that was sold to Microsoft in 2012 for $1.2 billion.

In 2017, Mr. Sacks began Craft Ventures, a firm that has invested in hundreds of start-ups, including some owned by his friends. He also started the “All-In” podcast three years later with friends and fellow investors Jason Calacanis, Chamath Palihapitiya and David Friedberg.

Mr. Sacks became a major player in Republican politics in 2022, when he donated $1 million to a super PAC supporting the Senate run of JD Vance, a former tech investor who worked for Mr. Thiel.

Last year, Mr. Sacks hosted a $12 million fund-raiser for Mr. Trump at his San Francisco mansion. The dinner made an impression on the presidential candidate.

“I love David’s house,” Mr. Trump said on “All-In” two weeks later. “What a house.”

After the election, Mr. Trump’s team asked Mr. Sacks to join the administration. He said he would, as long as he could continue working at Craft — and got his wish.

“It’s exactly what I requested,” Mr. Sacks said of his dual position in December.

Allying With Nvidia

Mr. Sacks opened the door of the White House to Silicon Valley leaders. Among the most prominent visitors was Jensen Huang, Nvidia’s chief executive.

Mr. Sacks and Mr. Huang, who had not met before Mr. Sacks joined the administration, forged a tight bond this spring, said three people familiar with the men, who were not authorized to discuss their interactions.

Both stood to benefit. Mr. Huang, 62, wanted government clearance to sell Nvidia’s highly coveted A.I. chips around the world, despite security concerns that the components could bolster China’s economy and military. Mr. Huang argued that restricting exports of Nvidia’s chips would push Chinese companies to develop more powerful alternatives. And spreading Nvidia’s technology would expand the A.I. industry, aiding the A.I. investments owned by Mr. Sacks and his friends.

In White House meetings, Mr. Sacks echoed Mr. Huang’s ideas that the best way to beat China would be to flood the world with American technology. Mr. Sacks worked to eliminate Biden-era restrictions on Nvidia and other American chip companies’ sales to foreign countries. He also opposed rules that would have made it difficult for foreign companies to buy U.S. chips for international data centers, five people with knowledge of the White House discussions said.

Free of those restrictions, Mr. Sacks flew to the Middle East in May and struck a deal to send 500,000 American A.I. chips — mostly from Nvidia — to the United Arab Emirates. The large number alarmed some White House officials, who feared that China, an ally of the Emirates, would gain access to the technology, these people said.

Ms. Hoffman said Mr. Sacks developed his thinking by talking to many people, not just Mr. Huang, and “wants the entire American tech stack to win.” None of his holdings benefited from the Emirates deal, she said.

Mylene Mangalindan, an Nvidia spokeswoman, said Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick was the company’s primary contact for A.I. chip sales abroad.

Mr. Sacks trumpeted the Emirati deal on “All-In” in May. “I would define winning as the whole world consolidates around the American A.I.” companies, he said.

There was one last obstacle to that goal: removing a U.S. ban on direct chip sales to China.

In the White House, Mr. Sacks promoted the idea that the ban inadvertently helped China by diverting chip sales to Huawei, a Chinese rival to Nvidia, four people familiar with the discussions said.

In July, Mr. Sacks and Mr. Huang took their argument to an Oval Office meeting with Mr. Trump. Before the meeting ended, Mr. Trump cleared Nvidia to sell its chips to China.

The Sacks Portfolio

The White House has praised Mr. Sacks, saying he minimized his financial conflicts of interest.

The ethics waivers that Mr. Sacks received said he and Craft Ventures had sold more than $200 million in crypto positions, including investments in Bitcoin, and were divesting stakes in A.I.-related companies including Meta, Amazon and xAI.

Mr. Sacks had started or completed sales of “over 99 percent” of his “holdings in companies that could potentially raise a conflict of interest concern,” the White House said.

Ms. Huston, the White House spokeswoman, said Mr. Sacks was “recused from participating in any matters that could affect his financial interests until he was able to divest of conflicting interests or until he received a waiver.”

But Mr. Sacks’s waivers provide an incomplete picture of his wealth and do not say when he sold his holdings in Meta, Amazon and other companies.

What is clear is that Mr. Sacks, directly or through Craft, has retained 20 crypto and 449 A.I.-related investments, according to The Times analysis.

Of the A.I.-related investments, 11 were designated in one waiver as “A.I. Interests.” The other 438 were classified as software or hardware makers, even though they promote A.I. offerings or services on their websites. In one example, the waiver categorized Palantir as “software as a service,” while the company’s website says it provides “A.I.-Powered Automation for Every Decision.” Forty-one of the companies have A.I. in their names, such as Resemble.AI and CrewAI.

In one of the waivers, the White House said many of the software companies “do not currently use A.I.-related applications in their core business in any material way,” but added that “many of them are likely to at some point in the future.”

Policies that Mr. Sacks supported at the White House have laid the groundwork for his investments to flourish.

The A.I. Action Plan promoted domestic production of autonomous drones and other A.I. inventions for the Pentagon. Mr. Sacks has stakes in defense tech start-ups such as Anduril, Firestorm Labs and Swarm Aero that make drones and other products, according to his filings. In September, Anduril announced a $159 million contract with the U.S. Army to build a new type of night vision goggles with A.I.

Shannon Prior, an Anduril spokeswoman, said the company had a relationship with the Army before the A.I. Action Plan and that it received the contract because its founder, Palmer Luckey, is “the world’s best virtual reality headset designer.” Ms. Hoffman said it was an “obvious idea” to include the military use of A.I. in the policy plan.

This spring, Mr. Sacks also backed a bill called the GENIUS Act to regulate stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a constant price of $1. Mr. Sacks promoted the legislation on CNBC and worked to advance it through Congress.

After the bill passed in July, Mr. Sacks called it “historic” and “momentous” on “All-In.” It is poised to significantly expand the stablecoin business.

One of Craft’s crypto investments is BitGo, a company that works with issuers of stablecoins. BitGo celebrated the GENIUS Act on its website and promptly capitalized, declaring that its service “fit perfectly” with the new guidelines. “The wait is over,” the site said.

In September, BitGo filed for an initial public offering. Craft owns 7.8 percent of the company, according to financial filings, which would be worth more than $130 million at BitGo’s 2023 valuation.

BitGo declined to comment. Ms. Hoffman said the GENIUS Act’s passage “contained no specific benefit for BitGo.”

Since Mr. Sacks joined the White House, A.I. companies have continued to announce new investments from Craft. In July, Vultron, a start-up that develops A.I. software for government contractors, celebrated $22 million in new financing and heralded the contribution of “Craft Ventures, co-founded by White House A.I. adviser David Sacks.”

The funding was secured before Mr. Sacks joined the administration, said Mac Liu, Vultron’s chief executive. “We mentioned David in the announcement because he’s a big name in A.I.,” he said.

Mr. Sacks remains on the board of Glue, a start-up that he helped found that offers an A.I.-assisted chat platform. In October, Glue announced $20 million in new funding, including from Craft.

Mr. Sacks had left corporate boards before joining the Trump administration, but stayed on Glue’s because “it was allowed,” Ms. Hoffman said. The funding was completed last year, she said. Glue did not respond to a request for comment.

Going ‘All-In’

In an “All-In” episode in March, two of the podcasts’ hosts, Mr. Friedberg and Mr. Palihapitiya, stood outside the East Wing.

They had been “running around” the White House, Mr. Palihapitiya said, as the show spliced in photos of them walking through wainscoted rooms and joining Mr. Sacks in the portico dividing the East and West Wings.

The podcasters then interviewed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent about economic policy. Days later, they returned with a nearly two-hour interview with Mr. Lutnick. Two months after that, they interviewed the secretaries of agriculture and the interior. In September, “All-In” posted a video of a private Oval Office tour with Mr. Trump.

Mr. Sacks’s government work has boosted the profile of the podcast, which is downloaded 6 million times a month. Its annual conference in Los Angeles generated roughly $21 million in ticket sales this year, up from $15 million last year, based on its $7,500 ticket price and public attendance estimates. In June, the podcast introduced a $1,200 “All-In”-branded tequila.

Mr. Sacks has forgone A.I. and crypto-related revenues, such as from sponsorships, but can share in sales from tequila and event tickets, Ms. Hoffman said. Jon Haile, the podcast’s chief executive, did not respond to a request for comment.

Mr. Sacks’s personal business and policy work came together at the July A.I. event in Washington, which he tapped “All-In” to host.

But Ms. Wiles, the White House chief of staff, did not want the administration to appear to endorse the “All-In” brand, two people with knowledge of the summit said. They said she called for the addition of a co-host. Mr. Sacks went to the organizers of the Hill and Valley Forum, an annual conference for tech and government officials, Ms. Hoffman said.

Visa and the New York Stock Exchange sponsored the A.I. summit. The organizers declined to disclose what the companies paid. Ms. Hoffman said “All-In” lost money hosting the event, and that “no V.I.P. reception occurred.” The New York Stock Exchange declined to comment, and Visa did not respond to a request for comment.

Mr. Sacks opened the event by describing his White House experience as “incredible” and hailing the administration’s work on A.I. and crypto. Then he handed off hosting duties to his “All-In” partners, who interviewed Mr. Huang of Nvidia and White House officials onstage.

In the keynote speech, Mr. Trump described Mr. Sacks as “great” before signing executive orders to speed the building of data centers and exports of A.I systems.

Then he handed Mr. Sacks the presidential pen.

,EVs,2025-11-30 12:17:25+00:00,The Mercury News,California's popular EV carpool lane decal program ends Monday: $490 tickets for violators,"Paul Rogers, progers@bayareanewsgroup.com",,,,,https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/11/30/californias-popular-ev-carpool-lane-decal-program-ends-monday-490-tickets-for-violators/,"The CHP says it will begin writing tickets for solo EV drivers who are in carpool lanes during restricted times from here on out.
For the past 25 years, federal law has allowed states to decide whether they want to grant carpool-lane access to electric vehicles.
Owners of electric vehicles say they are disappointed by the loss of the solo carpool lane access.
Last year, a Southern California Republican, Assemblyman Greg Wallis of Rancho Mirage, wrote a bill, AB 2678, to extend California’s EV carpool decal program until Jan. 1, 2027.
As of August, there were 511,877 active EV carpool stickers in California, according to DMV spokesman Jonathan Groveman.","Bad news, electric vehicle owners. Starting Monday morning, one of California’s longest-running incentives for people to buy electric cars — a program that provided access to carpool lanes regardless of how many people are in a zero-emission vehicle — is coming to end.

The Clean Air Vehicle decal program expired Oct. 1, after Republican leaders in Congress and the Trump administration declined to reauthorize the federal law that allowed it.

Two months ago, the California Highway Patrol gave motorists across the state a 60-day grace period until Dec. 1. That’s Monday. The CHP says it will begin writing tickets for solo EV drivers who are in carpool lanes during restricted times from here on out.

“Starting Monday it will be an enforceable violation,” said Sgt. Andrew Barclay, a CHP spokesman. “Officers have discretion on every stop they make. But the important thing to remember at this point is that you can now be cited for a violation of HOV lane rules even if you have the sticker.”

A violation ticket for driving solo in carpool lanes in California, also known as diamond lanes, or high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes, is a minimum $490 fine.

The colorful “Clean Air Vehicle” stickers have given drivers of Teslas, Priuses, Leafs, Rivians and other electric vehicles privileges to cruise along carpool lanes during commute times on congested roads like Highway 101 in Silicon Valley, 880 in the East Bay or the 405 freeway in Los Angeles.

For the past 25 years, federal law has allowed states to decide whether they want to grant carpool-lane access to electric vehicles. The original idea was to provide incentives to sell the vehicles, which reduce air pollution and greenhouse gases.

But under the most recent version of the federal law, signed by President Barack Obama in 2015 and called the “Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Act,” those permissions expired on Sept. 30. Republicans who currently have majorities in the House and Senate have not reauthorized the program, and President Donald Trump ended federal tax credits for electric vehicles, and blocked a California law requiring all new vehicles sold in the state starting in 2035 be electric.

Owners of electric vehicles say they are disappointed by the loss of the solo carpool lane access.

“It’s a huge, huge bummer for EV enthusiasts,” said John Stringer, president of Tesla Owners of Silicon Valley, a club with 6,000 members. “It has been one of the things we’ve been able to enjoy for years. It was one of the reasons why I bought my first EV.”

Most freeways in California require two, or in some cases three, people per vehicle to be allowed to drive in carpool lanes during morning and afternoon rush hours.

Stringer, a San Jose resident, said EV access has cut 20 minutes each way off his 1-hour-and-15-minute commute to work in San Mateo. Many of his fellow EV owners may have forgotten that the grace period for their once coveted stickers expires Monday, he said.

“It’s going to be a big adjustment,” he said. “If you are used to just getting into the carpool lane and going, you are going to have to adjust. People are going to need to remember. Some people are definitely going to be in for a rude awakening.”

California political leaders of both parties have opposed the loss of carpool lane access.

Last year, a Southern California Republican, Assemblyman Greg Wallis of Rancho Mirage, wrote a bill, AB 2678, to extend California’s EV carpool decal program until Jan. 1, 2027. It passed with large bipartisan majorities in Sacramento. Gov. Gavin Newsom signed it into law. But it won’t take effect unless Congress reauthorizes the program.

The auto industry and other supporters of the program tried to insert last-minute language into legislation to keep the federal government open before the shutdown earlier this fall, but that failed, said Bill Magavern, policy director for the Coalition for Clean Air, an environmental group.

Advocates are expected to try again next year when the federal highway funding bill comes up. But it’s far from a guarantee, he said, not only because Trump has pushed oil and coal over renewable energy and electric vehicles, but also because in some places like California, there are large numbers of EVs on the highways.

As of August, there were 511,877 active EV carpool stickers in California, according to DMV spokesman Jonathan Groveman. Since the program began in 2000, there have been 1,211,530 million issued.

When the program first began, after former Gov. Gray Davis signed AB 71, a law written by former Republican Assemblyman Jim Cunneen of San Jose in 1999, less than 2% of cars on the road were electric. Last year in California, 25.3% of the new vehicles sold were electric, according to the California Energy Commission.

In some counties, the number is even higher.

In Santa Clara County, 43.8% of new passenger vehicles purchased last year were “zero emission” — basically electric or plug-in hybrid. In Marin County, it was 40.1%; Alameda County 37.7%; Contra Costa County 32.7%; San Mateo County 25.3% and San Francisco 35.6%. It was 31% in Orange County, and 26.5% in Los Angeles County.

The top-selling car in California for the past three years has been the Tesla Model Y, according to data from the California New Car Dealers Association, surpassing the Honda Civic, Toyota Corolla and other traditional gasoline-powered vehicles that once led sales.

Nobody knows whether the HOV sticker change will increase traffic, or reduce it. It depends on whether more people carpool, work from home, take transit or other alternatives, or just decide to sit in the slow lanes during rush hour.

“EVs are kind of the norm now in California,” Stringer said. “I think this was inevitable.”",https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/EBT-L-HOV-XXXX-04.jpg?w=1024&h=683,N,,2025-11-30 08:57:37.333156

While these regions aim to move away from fossil fuels, they face unique challenges that could affect global climate change efforts. This transition is not only about shifting energy sources but also ensuring equitable technology transfer and economic stability. Let’s explore these challenges in detail and their implications.

Complexities of Energy Transition in the Global South

Developing nations often rely heavily on fossil fuels, presenting a significant hurdle in their energy transition efforts. According to the International Energy Agency, fossil fuels account for over 70% of energy consumption in many of these countries. Transitioning to renewable energy sources demands substantial investment and infrastructure changes, which are often unaffordable for these nations.

Moreover, the lack of technology and expertise further complicates this shift. Policies that promote technology transfer become crucial here, ensuring these countries can access and implement advanced technologies. The equitable distribution of such technologies can help bridge the gap between developed and developing nations, fostering a more balanced global climate policy. For more insights, explore discussions on Reddit regarding energy policies in developing regions.

Impact on Sustainable Development Goals

The energy transition is pivotal to achieving sustainable development goals (SDGs), particularly in poverty reduction and economic growth. However, the focus on renewable energy must be carefully aligned with these goals to avoid unintended consequences. For example, rapid shifts without proper planning might lead to job losses in traditional energy sectors, exacerbating poverty issues.

To mitigate such risks, policies should include retraining programs and investment in green jobs to ensure a just transition. This aligns with SDG 8, which emphasizes decent work and economic growth, and SDG 7, which focuses on affordable and clean energy. Initiatives that integrate these goals can create a more resilient economy in developing nations.

Climate Change and Policy Implications

The shift towards renewable energy in the global south has significant implications for global climate change policies. Developing nations, despite contributing less to global emissions, often face the brunt of climate impacts. Therefore, equitable climate finance is critical to support their transition efforts.

International bodies and agreements, such as the Paris Agreement, play essential roles here, mandating developed countries to provide financial resources. This support is vital for developing nations to implement climate resilience strategies effectively. Moreover, collaboration between these nations and developed economies can foster knowledge exchange, promoting sustainable practices globally.

Final Thoughts

In conclusion, the energy transition in developing nations is a multifaceted challenge that impacts sustainable development and climate change mitigation strategies. For these countries, achieving an equitable, sustainable energy system requires not only financial investment but also collaborative global efforts in technology transfer and policy-making. To succeed, we must ensure that climate finance and supportive policies are effectively implemented, allowing these nations to contribute positively to global climate goals while boosting their economic growth. This will not only help meet international commitments but also foster a more inclusive global community.

The state is increasingly powering its entire grid with 100% clean energy for periods of time, a significant achievement that puts it on a strong trajectory toward its official 2045 target. This ambitious progress, driven by landmark legislation like Senate Bill 100 (SB 100), underscores a deep commitment to combating climate change and building a sustainable energy system.

The Path to 100% California clean energy

California’s journey toward a fully clean energy grid has been marked by significant, record-breaking moments. In 2022, the state’s grid ran on 100% renewable energy for the first time, a feat it repeated and expanded upon in 2023 by achieving 100% zero-carbon energy for extended periods. These accomplishments were made possible by California’s diverse clean energy portfolio, which includes solar, wind, geothermal, nuclear, and hydroelectric power.

The state’s clean energy capacity is growing at a breakneck pace. With a current capacity of 28 gigawatts, solar energy is the undisputed leader, accounting for 67% of the total. The scale of this expansion is staggering; in 2023 alone, California added 10 GW of clean energy. This rapid progress is a testament to the state’s investment in renewable infrastructure and the sophisticated [basics of solar panel manufacturing] that make such growth possible.

Challenges Ahead for California clean energy

Despite these achievements, the road to a continuously 100% clean grid is paved with challenges. To meet its ultimate 2045 goal, the state must add an estimated 71 GW of new clean energy capacity. This expansion will require a parallel and massive increase in energy storage, particularly through battery systems. While the transition promises long-term environmental benefits, it has also contributed to California having some of the nation’s highest electricity prices, a critical issue for residents and businesses.

Energy storage is the linchpin for maintaining a stable and reliable power supply. Batteries are crucial for capturing excess energy generated during peak production—like sunny afternoons—and releasing it when demand is high or production is low, such as after sunset.

The scale of storage required is daunting. The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) has approved plans for deploying over 50,000 MW of energy storage by 2045. This will require unprecedented investments in technology, infrastructure, and innovation to ensure the grid remains resilient.

Investment and Innovation in California clean energy Storage

California is already making impressive strides in expanding its energy storage capacity. After adding 1.9 GW of battery storage in 2022, the state reached a total of 5.6 GW by 2023. This rapid growth is projected to continue, with estimates suggesting the state could add up to 10 GW of battery storage by 2026.

Groundbreaking projects like the Moss Landing Energy Storage Facility, with a capacity of 300 megawatts (MW) and the ability to store 1,200 megawatt-hours (MWh) of energy, are setting new global standards. These facilities are essential for balancing supply and demand, preventing blackouts, and ensuring the grid remains stable as it incorporates more intermittent renewable sources.

Overcoming Barriers to California clean energy Expansion

While the progress is impressive, California must navigate several barriers. These include regulatory hurdles, supply chain constraints, infrastructure modernization, and the need for continued technological innovation.

Regulatory frameworks must evolve to support the rapid deployment of clean energy and storage. This includes streamlining permitting processes for new solar farms and wind projects and creating incentives for utilities and private companies to invest in the necessary infrastructure, including crucial transmission line upgrades to move power from where it’s generated to where it’s needed. The intricate [solar panel manufacturing process] relies on a complex global supply chain, which presents its own set of challenges.

Constraints on the availability of [solar panel raw materials] and components for batteries pose a significant risk. The state must work with manufacturers to build resilient supply chains to support the construction and maintenance of its clean energy ecosystem. Understanding the entire pipeline, from raw materials to the [solar panel manufacturing machines] used in factories, is key to forecasting and mitigating these bottlenecks.

Innovation will also play a pivotal role. Continued research and development in advanced battery chemistries and alternative storage solutions—like pumped hydro, compressed air, and even novel ice-based systems—will be essential for meeting California’s ambitious goals affordably and reliably.

A Model for the Nation: California clean energy

California’s ambitious energy transition serves as a powerful model for other states and nations. It’s part of a broader decarbonization strategy that includes the electrification of transportation, with the state recently surpassing 200,000 public EV charging ports. This holistic approach demonstrates that a reliable, sustainable energy future is not just a dream but an achievable reality.

As California moves closer to its 2045 target, it will undoubtedly face more challenges. However, with a potent combination of policy support, private investment, and relentless innovation, the state is forging a path toward a fully clean energy grid. This journey will not only benefit Californians but also provide an invaluable blueprint for the global fight against climate change.

Lee Zeldin, Mr. Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency administrator, has labeled climate change a “religion” instead of what it is: a matter of physics.","When nearly 200 nations signed the 2015 Paris agreement, acknowledging the threat of rising global temperatures and vowing action, many hoped that the era of climate denial was finally over.

Ten years later it has roared back, arguably stronger than ever.

As delegates wrapped the annual United Nations climate talks last Saturday, those who have campaigned to reduce the use of fossil fuels expressed growing alarm that forces arrayed against them are gaining ground in the information war.

The oil, gas and coal industries continue to downplay the scientific consensus that the burning of fossil fuels is dangerously heating the planet. It’s a strategy that has been echoed by oil-rich countries such as Russia, Saudi Arabia and — under the Trump administration — the United States.

President Trump mocks global warming as a hoax, cheered on by a chorus of influencers online who regularly promote disinformation on social media platforms that once tried to curtail it. While such views have long been dismissed as conspiracy theories, their influence on the global policy debates has clearly grown.

The final statement of the U.N. talks, which were held in Belém, Brazil, did not even use the words “fossil fuels.”

“We thought that good ideas would get people to act,” J. Timmons Roberts, a researcher at Brown University and executive director of its Climate Social Science Network, lamented in a briefing on the eve of the talks.

“In fact there’s been a quite systematic campaign that’s been sophisticated and extremely well funded,” he said. “They have succeeded at undermining climate action globally.”

This year’s climate summit took place against a backdrop of increased drilling and mining — in Brazil, the host government recently granted a license to the state oil company to explore new sources of oil near the mouth of the Amazon River.

“They manipulate algorithms, sow hatred and spread fear,” he said, describing a surge in disinformation and propaganda aimed at blocking action to slow climate change.

The problem has become so acute that the summit, for the first time, put the issue on the agenda. A coalition of countries and international agencies issued a separate “Declaration on Information Integrity on Climate Change,” calling on governments to address climate disinformation, promote transparency and protect journalists, scientists and environmentalists.

The initiative is light, however, on details about how governments should go about it. By Friday, only 21 of the nearly 200 countries that signed the Paris agreement had also signed the disinformation declaration.

Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island, who was in Belém and has attended several climate summits, said the global embrace of the Paris agreement by most governments and major corporations for a time obscured the still-fierce opposition to ending fossil fuels.

“I think there was some confidence at the time that when governments got together, and everyone put forward their national commitments, everybody felt we were just going to sort of breeze past that,” Mr. Whitehouse said. “Now, I think, there is a better understanding of the true nature of the fossil fuel disinformation and corruption campaign.”

Mr. Lula said that this year’s summit would “deliver yet another defeat to denialism.” Instead, it struggled to build consensus.

The final conference statement did endorse the call to promote “information integrity” and provided more money for vulnerable countries hit by climate catastrophes. But it included only a voluntary agreement among nations to begin discussions on a “road map” to an eventual phaseout of fossil fuels. The modest outcome was only achieved after a bitter standoff with oil-producing countries from the Persian Gulf.

Critics blamed the meager results on oil, gas and coal interests that have been increasingly present at U.N. summits in recent years. One review of delegates by a group called the Kick Big Polluters Out coalition found 1,600 fossil fuel representatives participated in the Belém talks, a number that includes diplomats from countries with state-run oil companies.

“Once again, fossil fuel lobbyists outnumbered many delegations from the countries most affected by the climate crisis,” Brice Böhmer, climate and environment director for Transparency International, a Berlin-based nonprofit group, said in a statement.

For critics of the environmental movement, the shifting sentiment on display in Brazil was a victory after years of pressure on energy industries.

“There’s a lot of reality that has hit,” said Steven J. Milloy, the founder of JunkScience.com, a website that has disputed the scientific consensus on climate change. “People are realizing now that we need fossil fuels. Fossil fuels are here to stay.”

Polls consistently show that a majority of adults globally and in the United States consider climate change to be a serious threat.

At the same time, a growing body of research is warning that climate misinformation — from misleading claims from Mr. Trump that wind turbines “kill all the birds” to viral hashtags proclaiming clean energy is a scam — is steadily growing, amplified by social media.

The strategy is not subtle, a recent study found. Climate skeptics present their position as “projecting rationality, authority, and masculine self-control” while those who acknowledge global warming “are depicted through emotionally charged, feminized, and irrational imagery,” and labeled “alarmists” who propose radical solutions.

Political campaigns deploy the same playbook. Republicans frequently claimed the Biden administration was trying to “emasculate” American drivers by forcing them into electric vehicles. Lee Zeldin, Mr. Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency administrator, has labeled climate change a “religion” instead of what it is: a matter of physics.

Taylor Rogers, a White House spokeswoman, said that Mr. Trump was pursuing “energy addition, not energy transition.”

“The President has set a strong example for the rest of the world by reversing course on the Green Energy Scam and unleashing our natural resources, like beautiful, clean coal and natural gas, to strengthen our grid stability and lower energy costs,” she said, citing arguments that many economists dispute.

Still, Mr. Trump’s policies threaten more than 500 solar and energy storage projects in the U.S. that were set to provide 116 gigawatts of capacity. His administration also terminated a $4.9 billion loan guarantee for an 800-mile transmission line that would have carried mostly wind power from the Great Plains to some of the most strained parts of the nation’s power grid.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/26/multimedia/00cli-COP30-disinformation-01-zhfv/00cli-COP30-disinformation-01-zhfv-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-11-30 08:04:34.953650

By Alfred McCoy / TomDispatch

At the dawning of the British Empire in 1818, the romantic poet Percy Bysshe Shelley penned a memorable sonnet freighted with foreboding about the inevitable decline of all empires, whether in ancient Egypt or then-modern Britain.

In Shelly’s stanzas, a traveler in Egypt comes across the ruins of a once-monumental statue, with “a shattered visage lying half sunk” in desert sands bearing the “sneer of cold command.” Only its “trunkless legs of stone” remain standing. Yet the inscription carved on those stones still proclaims: “My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings: Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!” And in a silent mockery of such imperial hubris, all the trappings of that awesome power, all the palaces and fortresses, have been utterly erased, leaving only a desolation “boundless and bare” as “the lone and level sands stretch far away.”

Taken too literally, those verses might lead us to anticipate some future traveler finding fragments of St. Paul’s Cathedral scattered on the banks of the Thames River in London or stones from the Washington Monument strewn in a kudzu-covered field near the Potomac. Shelley is, however, offering us a more profound lesson that every empire teaches and every imperialist then forgets: Imperial ascent begets an inevitable decline.

Imperial Washington

Indeed, these days Donald Trump’s Washington abounds with monuments to overblown imperial grandeur and plans for more, all of which add up to an unconvincing denial that America’s global imperium is facing an Ozymandias-like fate. With his future Gilded Age ballroom meant to rise from the rubble of the White House’s East Wing, his plans for a massive triumphal arch at the city’s entrance, and a military parade of tanks and troops clanking down Constitution Avenue on his birthday, who could ever imagine such a thing? Not Donald Trump, that’s for sure.

In a celebration of his “works” that are supposedly making the “mighty despair” in foreign capitals around the world, his former national security adviser, Robert C. O’Brien, has recently argued in Foreign Affairs that the president’s “policy of peace through strength” is reversing a Democrat-induced decline of U.S. global power. According to O’Brien, instead of crippling NATO (as his critics claim), President Trump is “leading the biggest European rearmament of the postwar era”; unleashing military innovation “to counter China”; and proving himself the “indispensable global statesman by driving efforts to bring peace to… long-standing disputes” in Gaza, the Congo, and, quite soon, Ukraine as well. Even in North America, according to O’Brien, Trump’s attempt to acquire Greenland has forced Denmark to expand its military presence, putting Russia on notice that the West will compete for control of the Arctic.

As it happens, whatever the truth of any of that may be, the policy elements that O’Brien cites are certain to prove largely irrelevant to the ceaseless struggle for geopolitical power among the globe’s great empires. Or, to borrow a favorite Trumpian epithet from the president’s “cornucopia of crudeness,” in the relentless, often ruthless world of grand strategy, none of those factors amounts to a hill of “shit.”

Indeed, O’Brien’s epic catalogue of Trump’s supposed foreign policy successes cleverly avoids any mention of the central factor in the rise and fall of every dominant world power for the past 500 years: energy. While the United States made genuine strides toward a green energy revolution under President Joe Biden, his successor, the “drill, baby, drill” president, has seemed determined not just to destroy those gains, but to revert to dependence on fossil fuels “bigly,” as Trump would say. In a perplexing paradox, President Trump’s systematic attack on alternative energy at home will almost certainly subvert America’s geopolitical power abroad. How and why? Let me explain by dipping my toes in a bit of history.

For the past five centuries, the rise of every global empire has rested on an underlying transformation (or perhaps revolution would be a more accurate word for it) in the form of energy that drove its version of the world economy. Innovation in the basic force behind its rising global presence gave each successive hegemonic power — Portugal, Spain, England, the United States, and possibly now China — a critical competitive advantage, cutting costs and increasing profits. That energy innovation and the lucrative commerce it created infused each successive imperium with intangible but substantial power, impelling its armed forces relentlessly forward and crushing resistance to its rule, whether by local groups or would-be imperial rivals. Although scholars of imperial history often ignore it, energy should be considered, as I argued in my book To Govern the Globe, the determinative factor in the rise and fall of every global hegemon for the past five centuries.

Iberia’s Mastery of Muscle

In the fifteenth century, the Iberian powers — Portugal and Spain — manipulated the ocean winds and maximized the energy output of the human body, giving them new forms of energy that allowed their arid lands and limited populations to conquer much of the globe. By replacing the square sail of lumbering Mediterranean ships with a triangular sail, agile Portuguese vessels like the famed caravela de armada doubled their capacity to tack close to the wind, allowing them to master the world’s oceans.

By 1500, Portuguese warships had navigation instruments that allowed them to cross the widest bodies of water, sails to beat into the strongest headwinds, a sturdy hull for guns and cargo, and lethal cannons that could destroy enemy fleets or breach the walls of port cities. As a result, a small flotilla of Portuguese caravels soon conquered colonies on both sides of the South Atlantic Ocean and seized control of Asian sea lanes from the Red Sea to the Java Sea.

For the next three centuries, such sailing ships would transport 11 million African captives across the Atlantic to work as slaves in a new form of agriculture that was both exceptionally cruel and extraordinarily profitable: the sugar plantation. The output of Europe’s free yeoman farmers was then constrained by the limits of the individual body and the temperate climate’s short six-month growing season. By contrast, enslaved laborers, massed into efficient teams in tropical latitudes, were driven year-round to the brink of death and beyond to extract unprecedented productivity and profits from those plantations. Indeed, even as late as the nineteenth century, the U.S. southern slave plantation was, according to an econometric analysis, 35% more efficient than a northern family farm.

After developing the sugar plantation, or fazenda, as a new form of agribusiness on small islands off the coast of Africa in the fifteenth century, the Portuguese brought that system to Brazil in the sixteenth century. From there, it migrated to European colonies in the Caribbean, making that cruel commerce synonymous with the slave trade for nearly four centuries. So profitable was the slave plantation for its owners that, unlike almost every other form of production, it did not die from natural economic causes but would instead require the full force of the British navy to do it in.

The Dutch Harness the Winds

But the true masters of wind power would prove to be the Dutch, whose technological prowess would allow their small land, devoid of natural resources, to conquer a colonial empire that spanned three continents. In the seventeenth century, the Dutch drive for scientific innovation led them to harness the winds as never before, building sailing ships 10 times the size of a Portuguese caravel and windmills that, among other things, replaced the tedious hand sawing of logs to produce lumber for shipbuilding. With giant sails spanning over 90 feet, a five-ton shaft generating up to 50 horsepower, and several sawing frames with six steel blades each, a windmill’s four-man crew could turn 60 tree trunks a day into uniform planks to maintain the massive Dutch merchant fleet of 4,000 ocean-going ships.

By 1650, the Zaan district near Amsterdam, arguably Europe’s first major industrial area, had more than 50 wind-driven sawmills and was the world’s largest shipyard, launching 150 hulls annually (at half the cost of English-built vessels). Many of these were the Dutch-designed fluitschip, an agile three-masted cargo vessel that cut crew size, doubled sailing speed, and could carry 500 tons of cargo with exceptional efficiency.

Through its commercial acumen and mastery of wind power, tiny Holland defeated the mighty Spanish empire in the Thirty Years War (1618-48), then fought the British to a standstill in three massive naval wars, while building an empire that reached around the world — from the Spice Islands of Indonesia to the city of New Amsterdam on the island of Manhattan.

When Coal Was King

As Holland’s commercial empire began to fade, however, Great Britain was already launching an energy transition to coal-fired steam energy that would leave the wind and muscle power of the Iberian age in the dust of history. And the industrial revolution that went with it would build the world’s first truly global empire.

The Scottish inventor James Watt perfected the steam engine by 1784. Such machines began driving railways in 1825 and the Royal Navy’s warships in the 1840s. By then, an armada of steam engines was transforming the nature of work worldwide — driving sawmills, pulling gang plows, and sculpting the earth’s surface with steam shovels, steam dredges, and steam rollers. Between 1880 and 1900, the number of steam engines in the United States would triple from 56,000 units to 156,000, accounting for 77% of all American industrial power. To fuel that age of steam and steel, Britain’s coal production climbed to a peak of 290 million tons in 1913, while worldwide production reached 1.3 billion tons.

Coal was the catalyst for an industrial revolution that fused steam technology with steel production to make Britain the master of the world’s oceans. From the end of the Napoleonic wars in 1815 until the outbreak of World War I in 1914, tiny Britain with just 40 million people would preside over a global empire that controlled a quarter of all humanity directly through colonies and another quarter indirectly through client states. In addition to its vast territorial empire, Britannia ruled the world’s waves, while its pound sterling became the global reserve currency, and London the financial center of the planet.

America’s Petrol-Powered Hegemony

Just as Britain’s imperial age had coincided with its coal-driven industrial revolution, so Washington’s brand-new world order focused on crude oil to feed the voracious energy needs of its global economy. By 1950, in the wake of World War II, the U.S. petrol-powered economy was producing half the world’s economic output and using that raw economic power for commercial and military dominion over most of the planet (outside the Sino-Soviet communist bloc).

By 1960, the Pentagon had built a nuclear triad that gave it a formidable strategic deterrent, as five nuclear-powered submarines armed with atomic warheads trolled the ocean depths, while 14 nuclear-armed aircraft carriers patrolled the world’s oceans. Flying from 500 U.S. overseas military bases, the Strategic Air Command had 1,700 bombers ready for nuclear strikes.

As American automobile ownership climbed from 40 million units in 1950 to 200 million in 2000, the country’s oil consumption surged from 6.5 million barrels daily to a peak of 20 million. During those same decades, the federal government spent $370 billion to cover the country with 46,000 miles of interstate highways, allowing cars and trucks to replace railroads as the ribs of the nation’s transportation infrastructure.

To drive the carbon-fueled economy of Washington’s world order, there would be a dramatic, five-fold increase in the global consumption of liquid fossil fuels during the last half of the twentieth century. As the number of motor vehicles worldwide kept climbing, crude oil rose from 27% of global fossil-fuel consumption in 1950 to 44% by 2003, surpassing coal to become the world’s main source of energy.

To meet this relentlessly rising demand, the Middle East’s share of global oil production climbed from just 7% in 1945 to 35% in 2003. As the self-appointed guardian of the Persian Gulf whose vast oil reserves represented some 60% of the world’s total, Washington would become embroiled in endless wars in that tumultuous region, from the Gulf War of 1990-91 to its present-day interventions in Israel and Iran.

Whether thanks to Britain’s coal-fired factories or America’s auto traffic, all those carbon emissions were already producing signs of global warming that, by the 1990s, would set alarm bells ringing among scientists worldwide. From the “pre-industrial” baseline of 280 parts per million (ppm) in 1880, carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere kept climbing to 410 ppm by 2018, resulting in the rising seas, devastating fires, raging storms, and protracted droughts that came to be known as global warming.

As evidence of the climate crisis became undeniable, the world’s nations responded with striking unanimity by signing the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement to cut carbon emissions and surge investments into alternative energy that soon yielded significant breakthroughs in both cost and efficiency. Within four years, the International Energy Agency predicted that dramatic drops in the cost of solar panels meant that solar energy would soon be “the new king of the world’s electricity markets.” Indeed, as technology slashed the cost of battery storage and solar panels, the International Renewable Energy Agency reported in 2024 that the solar generation of electricity had become 41% cheaper than fossil fuels, while offshore wind was 53% cheaper — a truly significant disparity that will, as technology continues to slash the cost of solar energy, render the use of coal and natural gas for electricity an economic irrationality, if not an utter absurdity.

In the game of empires, seemingly small margins can have large consequences, often marking the difference between dominance and subordination, success and failure — whether the 35% advantage of enslaved over free labor, the 50% cost advantage for Dutch sailing craft over British ones, and now a 41% savings for solar over fossil fuels. Moreover, the day is fast coming when fossil-fuel electricity will cost more than twice as much as alternative energy from solar and wind power.

To assure America’s economic future, the administration of President Joe Biden began investing trillions of dollars in alternative energy by building battery plants, encouraging massive wind and solar projects, and continuing a consumer subsidy to sustain Detroit’s transition to electric vehicles. In January 2025, however, Donald Trump entered the White House (again) determined to roll back the global green revolution. After quitting the Paris climate accord and labeling climate change a “hoax” or “the green new scam,” President Trump has halted construction of major offshore wind projects, ended the subsidy for electric vehicle purchases, and opened yet more federal lands for coal and oil leases. Armed with extraordinary executive powers and a single-minded determination, he will predictably delay, if not derail, America’s transition to alternative energy, missing market opportunities and undercutting the country’s economic competitiveness by chaining it to overpriced fossil fuels.

China’s Green-Energy Ride to Global Power

While Washington was demolishing America’s green energy infrastructure, Beijing has been working to make China a global powerhouse for alternative energy. Ten years ago, its leaders launched a “Made in China 2025” program to storm the heights of the global economy by becoming the world leader in 10 strategic industries, eight of which involved some aspect of the green-energy transformation, including “new materials,” “high-tech ships,” “advanced railways,” “energy-saving and new energy vehicles,” and “energy equipment.” Those “new materials” include China’s virtual monopoly on rare earth minerals, which are absolutely critical to the manufacturing of the key components for renewable energy — specifically, wind turbines, solar panels, energy storage systems, electric vehicles, and hydrogen extraction. In sum, Beijing is already riding the green energy revolution in a serious bid to become the world’s “leading manufacturing superpower” by 2049, while erasing America’s economic edge and its global hegemony in the bargain.

So, you might ask, have any of those seemingly pie-in-the-sky plans already become an economic reality? Given China’s recent progress in key energy sectors, the answer is a resounding yes.

Under its economic plan, China has already come to dominate the world’s solar power industry. In 2024, it cut the wholesale price of its solar panel exports in half and nearly doubled its exports of panel components. To replace its old export “trio” of clothing, furniture, and appliances, Beijing has mandated a “new trio” of solar panels, lithium batteries, and electric cars. And to put what’s happening in perspective, imagine that, in just the month of May, China installed enough wind and solar energy to power a country as big as Poland, reaching an impressive figure that represents half the world’s “total installed solar capacity.” By 2024, China was already producing at least 80% of the world’s solar panel components, dominating the global market, and undercutting would-be competitors in Europe and the U.S. Driving all that explosive growth, China’s investment in clean energy has reached nearly $2 trillion, representing 10% of its gross domestic product, and has been growing at three times the rate of its overall economy, meaning it would soon account for a full 20% of its entire economy.

With similar determination, its electric vehicles (EVs) are now beginning to capture the global car market. By 2024, 17.3 million electric cars were made worldwide, and China produced 70% of them. Not only are Chinese companies opening massive robotic assembly plants worldwide to crank out such cars by the millions, but they are also making the world’s cheapest and best cars — with the YangWang U9-X hitting a world speed record of 308 miles per hour; BYD’s latest plug-in hybrid models, priced at only $13,700 and capable of traveling a record 1,200 miles on a single charge and single tank of gas; the YangWang U8 with a capacity to literally drive across water; and the Xiaomi SU-7 displaying a high-tech driver interface that makes a Tesla look like a Ford Pinto.

Since an EV is just a steel box with a battery, technology will soon allow low-cost electric vehicles to completely eradicate gas guzzlers, enabling China to conquer the global car market — with full electric cars like the self-driving BYD Seagull sedan already priced at $8,000, models like BYD’s Han with a 5-minute charge time that’s faster than pumping a tank of gas, and sedans like the Nio ET7 with a standard range on a single charge of 620 miles. And most of that extraordinary technological progress has happened in less than four years, essentially the time remaining in Donald Trump’s second term in office.

An Agenda for America’s Economic Future

By discouraging alternative energy and encouraging fossil fuels, President Trump is undercutting America’s economic competitiveness in the most fundamental way imaginable. Amid an historic transformation in the world’s energy infrastructure (comparable in scope and scale to the coal-fired industrial revolution), the United States will spend the next three years under his watch digging coal and burning oil and natural gas, while the rest of the industrial world follows China as it pursues technological innovation to the furthest frontiers of the human imagination. Indeed, the latest annual report from the world’s energy watchdog, the International Energy Agency, states bluntly that the transition away from fossil fuels is “inevitable” as the world, “led by a surge in cheap solar power in… the Middle East and Asia,” installs more green energy capacity in the next five years than it has in the last 40 combined.

By the time Donald Trump leaves office in 2029, this country will be distinctly on the imperial decline amid fast-paced changes that will make electric vehicles universal and solar-powered electricity an economic imperative. And just as the Dutch used energy technology to capture their imperial moment in the seventeenth century, so the Chinese will undoubtedly do the same in this century.

After all, how can the United States produce competitive products, even for domestic consumption (much less export), if our costs for energy, the basic component of every economic activity, become double those of our competitors? Simply put, it won’t be possible.

If, however, when Donald Trump’s term in office is done, this country moves quickly to recover its capacity for economic rationality, it should be able to regain some version of its place in the world economy. For once the United States rejoins the green energy revolution, it can use its formidable engineering ingenuity to accelerate the development of this transformative technology — simultaneously reducing the CO2 emissions that are choking the planet and securing the livelihoods of average American workers in the bargain.

Unlike oceans, Great Lakes states, not the federal government, have jurisdiction over offshore wind projects.

Despite past efforts, no offshore wind turbines currently exist in the Great Lakes due to economic and legal challenges. Erie state Rep. Bob Merski has sponsored a bill to facilitate development.

Researchers are studying the unique challenges for Great Lakes turbines, including freshwater ice and supply chain logistics.

Offshore wind power could provide far more electricity than the U.S. uses for residential, commercial and industrial purposes. But the federal government has recently stopped approving offshore projects in the ocean.

Another option is available, though: the Great Lakes, where we are based as water policy researchers, and where state agencies rather than federal officials are the trustees of the lakes. A January 2025 executive order from President Donald Trump attempts to stop all federal permits for offshore and onshore wind power pending a review of federal wind leasing and permitting practices.

But the states, not the federal government, handle leases and permits for wind power on the Great Lakes, though federal agencies are involved in the overall process. It is unclear how this executive order might impede efforts to move forward with offshore wind in the lakes, but at the very least states could lay the groundwork now to be prepared to act when the next shift in federal priorities arrives.

A 2023 analysis from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory found that the Great Lakes states have enough offshore wind power potential to provide three times as much electricity as all eight Great Lakes states use currently, which would mean plenty left over to meet increasing demand or send power elsewhere in the country.

States are looking for opportunities

States have been forging their own paths separate from federal clean energy policy for decades. All eight Great Lakes states have state clean energy goals, and five of them — Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, New York and Wisconsin — have a goal to achieve 100% clean or renewable energy by 2040 or 2050.

The challenge is not just to transform the current energy supply. As transportation and other sectors electrify, that increases electricity demand. As artificial intelligence proliferates, tech companies need more and more electricity and water for their data centers. By 2028, data centers are projected to consume nearly 12% of the country’s total usage, which requires massive increases in production in the Great Lakes and other key locations.

Companies and states are looking high and low to find enough electricity to meet the rising demand. They are extending the lives of coal-fired power plants and building new gas-fired power plants. Elon Musk’s xAI company has even been powering an artificial intelligence data center in Tennessee with massive generators that add air pollution without permits.

Government and industry are also looking to other sources, such as investing in nuclear fusion advancement and building geothermal plants.

A brief history

In the 2000s and 2010s, the Great Lakes Commission Wind Collaborative, Wisconsin Public Service Commission and the Michigan Great Lakes Wind Council began to sketch out regulations for offshore wind in the Great Lakes and to identify locations that might be suitable for the turbines.

In 2012, the Obama administration agreed to collaborate with five Great Lakes states — Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, New York and Pennsylvania — to streamline a permitting process for offshore wind development. Multiple projects were proposed off the shores of Michigan, Ohio and Ontario, Canada, though Ontario banned offshore wind projects in 2011.

Since then, momentum has stalled. One effort, the Icebreaker project off Cleveland, was approved and survived various legal challenges, but the project backers paused it indefinitely in 2023 due to the economic impacts of the legal delays.

Community activists are split, with some embracing offshore wind in the Great Lakes as part of a clean energy future and others vocally opposing it, citing environmental, health and economic concerns.

As of mid-2025, the Great Lakes were home to no offshore wind turbines.

Big potential, big unknowns

States continue to explore the possibility of offshore wind power in the Great Lakes. In early 2025, Illinois legislators again introduced a bill to create a pilot wind project off Chicago in Lake Michigan.

Also in 2025, Pennsylvania legislators introduced a bill sponsored by Rep. Bob Merski, of Erie, D-2nd Dist., to facilitate offshore wind power in Lake Erie. If adopted, the law would map which areas are fit to be leased for development by avoiding nearshore areas, shipping lanes and migration pathways. The Ontario Clean Air Alliance is pushing the province to lift its moratorium and reconsider offshore wind in Canadian waters.

A lot of details remain unknown. New York state supports offshore wind in the ocean but says “Great Lakes Wind does not provide the same electric and reliability benefits” by comparison. Ocean wind tends to be closer to areas where electricity demand is high, which can make those projects more cost-effective.

New York also concluded in 2022 that despite the combined 144.5 terawatt-hours of annual technical potential in state waters in Lake Erie and Lake Ontario, “numerous practical considerations … would need to be addressed before such projects can be successfully commercialized.”

To further explore the concerns New York’s report and others have raised, in 2024, with National Science Foundation funding, we collaborated with a team of researchers looking at a wide range of issues, including engineering, environmental effects and law. That effort resulted in articulating research questions whose answers would clarify how realistic different aspects of offshore wind could be in the Great Lakes, such as:

How does ice that forms in freshwater affect the structural integrity of turbines?

Are floating turbines a better fit than traditional fixed-bottom turbines to reach the higher wind speeds in the deeper parts of the lakes and out of view from shore?

If turbine components and installation vessels can’t fit through the St. Lawrence Seaway, could they be built in the region and drive economic development?

Can turbines be located in places that improve fisheries and avoid migratory paths of birds and bats?

How can states establish leasing and permitting programs that maximize environmental, social and economic benefits?

State jurisdiction is an opportunity

In the oceans, U.S. states have jurisdiction from shore out three miles, with the federal government’s jurisdiction continuing out for hundreds of miles beyond that. So offshore project sites in the oceans are leased by the federal government.

The Great Lakes are different. The state governments hold the lakes’ waters and submerged lands in trust for the public. And state jurisdiction extends from shore all the way out to the boundary of a neighboring state’s jurisdiction or the international boundary with Canada.

Regulation of planning, site selection, leasing and other elements of offshore wind projects in the Great Lakes are the responsibility of one or another U.S. state. The federal government’s role is secondary, conducting environmental reviews and protecting navigation, but could still result in slowing state-led projects.

In research we published in 2024 and 2025, we explain that states could evaluate and select offshore wind projects based on a range of social and environmental benefits, in addition to financial considerations. For instance, they could look for designs that provide fish habitat or seek corporate partners that agree to train local workers, manufacture turbines and ships near the lakes, and provide cheaper electricity to local consumers.

Despite all the unknowns, we encourage greater support for research to harness the potential of offshore wind energy in the Great Lakes to be a renewable resource for states, the region and the nation as a whole.","https://www.goerie.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2024/07/02/NETN/74277612007-getty-images-520511959.jpg?crop=3350,1885,x0,y1426&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-11-30 05:57:12.566523

Asia has not been the only bright spot. Trump’s trade deal with the EU, announced earlier this year, saw Brussels agree to invest $750 billion in American energy by 2028.

Congress has also gotten in on the action, primarily via the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which mandated offshore oil and gas leases, opening up drilling in the Gulf of America. It also brought down the federal royalty rate for offshore gas and oil development to 12.5%, restoring it to where it was before former President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act increased it to over 16%.

The “big, beautiful” bill also included the Enhancing Energy Recovery Act. Originally a separate bill, the legislation increased 45Q tax credits. While these may not be well-known, they are extremely important for companies in the energy sector, as they provide tax credits for carbon capture. Previous versions of the tax credit were limited to only certain types of companies; the bill eliminated this, allowing for what lawmakers called “across-the-board” access.

But there is more that can be done. The Natural Gas Export Expansion Act, currently pending before the Senate, will make it easier for the U.S. to expedite LNG abroad to any country that is not under sanction. Sponsored by Sens. Ted Cruz (R-TX), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), and Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), the bill recognizes that LNG will be, going forward, a key tool for the U.S. as it navigates a multipolar world order where Russia, China, and other adversaries are all seeking economic leverage. At the same time, it empowers domestic producers — helping America at home and abroad.

MIKE JOHNSON WARNS DELIVERING ON TRUMP’S AFFORDABILITY AGENDA WILL TAKE ‘A WHILE’: ‘VERY COMPLEX’

Whether the Natural Gas Export Expansion Act is passed via a new reconciliation package or on its own, the Trump administration should throw its weight behind it, and Republicans should use their majority in the House to pass it, thereby giving it momentum in the Senate.

America is a land blessed with a plethora of natural resources, including energy. As we seek to bolster our own people while securing peace and stability abroad, we should use these resources to our advantage.","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AP24305092104734.jpg?resize=1200,683",N,,2025-11-30 05:57:43.745399

Renewable energy digital services are becoming the foundation of our new energy system.","The energy industry is in a strange place right now. People talk nonstop about clean energy, net-zero goals, big plans for the future — but the practical side is much messier. Even if we keep adding solar and wind at a record pace, it’s still not enough. IRENA estimates that the world needs roughly 1,000 GW of new renewable capacity every year from now until 2030. It’s a massive target, and the older power grids we rely on were never designed for anything like this.

With conventional power plants, you more or less know what you’re getting. They run steadily, and operators can control the output. Renewables don’t behave that way. Digital systems help make sense of everything: they predict demand, estimate how much energy renewables will produce, and coordinate countless devices scattered across different regions. And now it’s worth looking at the companies that are actually pushing these solutions forward.

What renewable energy sources actually look like today

When people say “renewable energy,” they’re usually thinking about basic stuff. Solar panels on roofs. Maybe some windmills. But it’s gotten way more complex than that.

Solar energy now includes massive industrial parks generating hundreds of megawatts. There’s Al Dhafra PV2 in the UAE – the world’s biggest single-site solar plant with four million modules powering 200,000 homes. Some solar installations float on reservoirs. Others are built right into building facades.

Wind energy has gone offshore in a big way. Dogger Bank in the UK has turbines as tall as skyscrapers, sitting miles out in the North Sea where winds are stronger and more consistent. These things can power millions of homes.

Hydropower is old news, sure. But pumped hydro storage is basically a giant battery – pump water uphill when you have extra electricity, let it flow down through turbines when you need power. Simple physics, massive impact.

Biomass energy uses everything from agricultural waste to wood chips. Countries like India and the US are converting biomass plants that used to run on coal.

Geothermal just keeps running. No weather dependence, no variability. Iceland gets most of its energy this way. And green hydrogen, made by splitting water with renewable electricity, might be the future for heavy industry and shipping.

Here’s what all these sources have in common: they only work at scale if we have serious digital transformation in renewable energy. You can’t manage this many variables, this much data, this many interconnected systems without software that can think faster than humans.

The companies building these solutions

1. DXC Technology

DXC gets into the complicated stuff. They build Distributed Energy Resource Management Systems – DERMS for short. What that means in plain English: software that can juggle thousands of solar panels, wind turbines, and batteries at once.

Their renewable energy digital services do real-time forecasting and balancing. When a cloud covers a solar farm, the system already knows and has adjusted before anyone notices a flicker. They use predictive analytics to figure out what’s going to happen hours or days ahead, which matters when you’re trying to keep the lights on for millions of people.

The thing about DXC is they’re focused on helping utilities transition without blowing up their existing infrastructure. Grid stability sounds boring until your power goes out. Their systems make sure that doesn’t happen, even when half your electricity is coming from sources that change by the minute.

2. Siemens Energy

Siemens has been in energy forever. Their Omnivise Digital Solutions covers pretty much everything – from the moment you build a power plant to the day you tear it down decades later. They make distributed control systems that pull data from every sensor, every turbine, every transformer, and show it all in one place.

What’s interesting is their edge computing for substations. Instead of sending all data to some central cloud and waiting for instructions, the processing happens right there on-site. Milliseconds matter when you’re managing a grid.

Siemens is also deep into green hydrogen tech. They’re working on projects in over 100 countries and their equipment generates about half the world’s electricity. When you flip a light switch, there’s a decent chance Siemens technology is involved somewhere in that chain.

3. Schneider Electric

Schneider built EcoStruxure, which is basically their answer to “how do we make everything smarter?” It connects hardware, software, and services to optimize energy use in buildings, factories, and grids.

Their new One Digital Grid Platform uses AI to manage planning, operations, and asset management all in one place. The AI automatically catches when the digital model of a grid doesn’t match reality – like when someone forgot to update the system after installing new equipment. Sounds simple, but that kind of mismatch causes real problems.

Schneider also runs a venture fund backing startups working on clean energy tech. Their approach to digital transformation in renewable energy includes everything from microgrid management to consulting services that help companies figure out how to actually decarbonize their supply chains.

4. ABB

ABB does electrification and automation at a massive scale. They make robotic systems for manufacturing solar panels, complete instrumentation packages for solar and wind plants, and the smart grid systems that tie it all together.

Their battery storage solutions are particularly interesting. BESS-as-a-Service means companies can use battery systems without buying them outright. For industrial users trying to cut electricity costs during peak hours, that’s huge. You get energy independence without the capital expenditure.

ABB supplies converters for the world’s biggest offshore wind farms and generators for hydroelectric plants. Their renewable energy digital services include distributed control systems that give operators real-time visibility into everything happening across their assets. Less downtime means more power generation means more money.

5. GE Vernova

GE Vernova is the spinoff from General Electric that focuses purely on power generation and grid management. They generate about 25% of the world’s electricity through their installed base of 2200 GW worth of equipment.

Their Grid Orchestration Software uses AI to predict demand, optimize energy flow, and integrate all those distributed resources we keep talking about. Their Advanced Asset Performance Management system pulls data from information systems, operational systems, and engineering models to help people make faster decisions.

GE Vernova partnered with Amazon Web Services to accelerate cloud migration and bring generative AI into energy infrastructure. They’re working on everything from wind farms to small modular reactors. The renewable energy digital services from GE Vernova are about coordination – making sure different energy sources work together instead of fighting each other.

6. IBM Energy and Utilities

IBM brings Watson and AI expertise to energy. Their Maximo platform manages assets, and Watson handles the heavy data analytics. They’re using AI to forecast renewable energy production, optimize maintenance schedules, and manage distributed resources.

IBM is also experimenting with quantum computing for modeling complex energy systems. Their blockchain platforms enable peer-to-peer energy trading – imagine selling excess solar power from your roof directly to your neighbor. They build digital twins that simulate how turbines, transformers, and entire grids will behave under different conditions.

Cloud solutions from IBM let energy companies scale operations without spending millions on IT infrastructure. Digital transformation in renewable energy from IBM is about making the complex stuff manageable through better data and better intelligence.

7. Accenture

Accenture isn’t selling hardware or software directly. They’re consultants who help energy companies figure out their entire digital transformation strategy. Sometimes the problem isn’t technology – it’s knowing which technology to use and how to implement it without disrupting your business.

They work with industry leaders on IoT, Big Data, AI, and cloud solutions. Their approach covers operational excellence, asset management, customer experience, and decarbonization. Renewable energy digital services from Accenture include predictive maintenance for wind and solar farms, platforms for managing virtual power plants, and real-time carbon emission monitoring.

They also help companies integrate ESG principles into operations and reporting.

Why this stuff actually matters

We’re at a turning point. IRENA calls digital transformation in renewable energy a “critical catalyst” for hitting COP28 targets – tripling renewable capacity by 2030. Companies investing in digital solutions are already cutting operational costs by 20-30%.

Predictive analytics can forecast wind and solar generation 24-48 hours ahead. That gives grid operators time to prepare for fluctuations. IoT sensors detect equipment failures weeks before they happen, cutting maintenance costs by 20% and extending equipment life by 3-5 years.

Fixing this requires collaboration between private companies, governments, and tech firms. Projects like TwinEU – a 25 million euro initiative to create a digital twin of Europe’s electricity grid – show what’s possible when everyone works together. Denmark and Germany are already using digital twins to improve renewable integration and prevent grid failures.

Bottom line

Digital transformation in renewable energy isn’t optional anymore. The world is electrifying transportation, industry, and buildings. The only way to provide stable, affordable, clean energy is through smart grids that can adapt on the fly.

These seven companies – DXC Technology, Siemens Energy, Schneider Electric, ABB, GE Vernova, IBM, and Accenture – each tackle the problem differently. Some focus on hardware and automation. Others build software and analytics. Some create comprehensive consulting strategies.

Renewable energy digital services are becoming the foundation of our new energy system. They let us not just generate cleaner energy, but use it smarter.

By 2050, renewable sources should provide half the world’s electricity. But that future only happens if we invest in the technology to manage it effectively. Companies implementing digital transformation in renewable energy today aren’t just saving money – they’re building the infrastructure for a sustainable, secure, and prosperous future for everyone.",https://azbigmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/renewable-energy.jpg,N,,2025-11-30 05:57:18.412023

Ola Electric’s Backup Plan On a sticky wicket, the listed EV maker has switched to plan B — B for battery.","When a hero product begins to wobble, the founder’s first instinct is almost always the same: pull the diversification lever. That’s exactly the crossroads where Bhavish Aggarwal of Ola Electric is finding himself standing. And he has been swift in diversifying. In October, Aggarwal launched Ola Shakti, a residential battery energy storage system (BESS).

The device, which uses Ola’s in-house 4680 Bharat Cells, has been built to provide power backup to residential units, farms, and commercial purposes.

But why this diversification from an EV maker, one may ask?

Well, once celebrated as India’s largest electric vehicle maker, with a commanding 30% market share, Ola Electric’s state of affairs is in complete shambles. The company has lost its leadership position, thanks to its shrinking monthly unit sales, which it acknowledges could fall even further. Then, raising fresh capital has become challenging for the EV maker.

The tension is clearly visible. While its losses continued to take a toll on its balance sheet, compounded with falling revenues, its cash balance dropped to INR 2,903 Cr in Q2 FY26 from INR 3,959 Cr in March 2025.

This erosion has bit Ola Electric, and Aggarwal has been forced to shift his narrative and capital towards an ancillary business that he hopes will eventually reduce costs and offset slowing scooter demand.

While the future holds the answer to whether the bet will eventually pay off, let’s trace how the EV juggernaut skidded out of the fast lane.

The EV Rocket That Lost Its Grip

For years, Ola Electric symbolised India’s EV two wheeler revolution. Despite arriving later than its Bengaluru rival Ather Energy, Ola Electric sprinted ahead with a strong brand recall, aggressive marketing, and rapid scale-up of its scooter manufacturing.

For a brief period, the company held a 30% market share. Ola Electric has struggled to be consistent.

Poor after-sales service, unresolved quality concerns, and intensifying competition steadily eroded its lead.

Compounding this, Ola Electric quietly shelved its ambitions in electric three-wheelers and cars, signalling that the company was stretched way too thin.

The situation further worsened when, in a bid to conserve cash, Ola Electric abruptly discontinued discounting, an aggressive pricing tactic that had fuelled its early rise. Without subsidies, customers simply walked away. The sales collapse was immediate, allowing Ather Energy to overtake Ola Electric.

While Ola Electric sold around 52,666 units in Q2 FY26, Ather sold around 66,000 units in the quarter.

This reversal of fortunes has made fundraising exceedingly difficult for the EV major. Lenders have steered clear of the company’s proposal to raise INR 1,700 Cr via debt, a plan that was approved by the company board in May 2025. But more than six months later, the company is yet to conclude this raise.

Now, the company wants to raise INR 1,500 Cr in a mix of debt and equity, for which it received a shareholder nod this week.

While the company has avoided stating the reasons for this change in plans, backers are wary of declining sales and the absence of a stable operating model.

Ola Electric’s Backup Plan

On a sticky wicket, the listed EV maker has switched to plan B — B for battery.

In a move that many believe was inspired from Tesla’s journey, Aggarwal announced in 2022 that Ola Electric would manufacture its own cells to gain control over costs and supply chains.

By 2024, Bhavish Aggarwal was ambitiously projecting a 100 GWh battery cell capacity, even as Ola Electric was laying the groundwork for a mere 1.4 GWh.

Delays were inevitable. The much-touted “indigenous” battery cell, expected to be mass-produced in 2023, finally entered production in Q1 FY26, almost two years behind schedule.

Then, just one quarter after stating that Ola Electric would complete 5 GWh of installation by FY26, Aggarwal revised the target to 5.9 GWh by FY26-end and 20 GWh by the second half of 2027.

This ongoing course correction, with every milestone pushed back again and again, shows that it has been rather tough for Aggarwal to scale its battery manufacturing. Besides, the cell business is a major cash guzzler.

In Q2 FY26, its battery vertical, Ola Cell Technologies, clocked a mere INR 4 Cr in top line (up from INR 1 Cr in Q2 FY25), while losses surged a massive 61% YoY to INR 79 Cr.

To aid the slowing sales of its EV scooters, Ola needs a new narrative, and ideally, a new revenue generator. And its diversification to battery tech fits perfectly.

Aggarwal sees FY26 as a ‘transition year’ where Ola activates its next growth vector in energy. He claims this energy segment will generate INR 100 Cr by Q4 FY26, and INR 1,200 Cr by FY27.

Given Ola’s history of overpromising and underdelivering, these numbers could be just fancy mumbo jumbo.

An Uncertain Road Ahead

Aggarwal is now reportedly pitching his newly launched residential battery system to investors, an implicit sign that the scooter business no longer inspires confidence on its own. But the path ahead is fraught with structural challenges.

The battery storage market is already dominated by giants such as Exide and Amara Raja that have deep pockets, strong goodwill, and powerful distribution networks.

While the market is dominated by lead acid battery systems sold at relatively low price points, Ola Electric is attempting to sell pricey lithium-ion packs, priced in the range of INR 29,999 to a steep INR 1,59,999, depending on capacity.

Then there’s the challenge of building a nationwide distribution network from scratch, which will put even more pressure on the company’s already strained balance sheet. Putting pressure further on this will be Ola’s credibility in the market.

Its new 4680 cells, though positioned as a technological breakthrough, are untested at scale. The company’s history of quality issues with its scooters still hangs over it, and any reliability problems with these battery packs could cripple the segment even before it takes off.

Aggarwal may be betting big on energy storage, but he is entering a category where reputation, reliability and service matter more than hype – the areas where Ola still has significant ground to gain.

As for now, Ola Electric’s diversification to energy storage appears to be a defensive manoeuvre against sliding scooter sales, missed fundraising attempts, and eroding investor trust.

Aggarwal may frame this as the company’s next growth frontier, but the reality is that Ola is stepping into a capital-heavy, competition-dense industry with untested technology, a fragile brand trust, and weak balance sheets.

The question is simple: Is Ola only delaying the inevitable, or charting a real comeback?",https://inc42.com/cdn-cgi/image/quality=75/https://asset.inc42.com/2025/11/The-outline-ola-electric-social-1.jpg,N,,2025-11-30 06:58:15.833069

But manufacturing the solar panels, wind turbines and battery cells for those energy sources is anything but clean.

Most production facilities require large amounts of electricity from emission-spewing coal and gas plants to make them, explained Sergey Paltsev, deputy director of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Center for Sustainability Science and Strategy.

Mining the minerals needed for solar panels and batteries also requires huge amounts of mostly dirty energy and can also pollute the environment and endanger the health of local residents.

“Low-carbon sources are lower, but they’re not zero,” Paltsev said. “We definitely need to educate both decision-makers and the general public on making sure that we are not making claims which are not realistic.”

It all begs the question: How clean really is green energy, and do the potential benefits offset the negative impacts?

‘There’s a big difference’

Manufacturing wind, solar and batteries can come with a significant upfront carbon footprint. But nearly all research agrees that those energy sources produce far fewer greenhouse gas emissions than coal or gas over their entire lifecycle.

Coal plants, on average, generate 1,000 grams of CO2 for every kilowatt hour of energy produced, according to an analysis by the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory.

Wind generates 13 grams per kilowatt hour; solar produces 28 grams; and lithium-ion batteries generate 33 grams, according to the analysis.

“When you are comparing around 10 grams versus 1,000, that’s a big difference,” Paltsev said. “We need to keep that scale in perspective.”

To put those numbers in perspective, solar panels need to operate for 4 to 8 months to offset their manufacturing emissions; wind turbines need about three months to two years; and lithium batteries take 1 to 3 years.

That’s a short stretch in the lifespan of a solar array.

“When we do a solar system, it’s there for 30 years if you want it to be,” said Allan O’Shea, president of Contractors Building Supply in Copemish. “You will continue to make your return on investment on the minerals and silver and steel, the aluminum you’ve put into it and the glass.”

Fossil fuels also generate huge amounts of toxic air pollution that killed more than 8 million people worldwide in 2018, according to a Harvard University study released in 2021.

While manufacturing solar, wind and other clean energy sources produce some air pollution, the technology is completely clean once it’s operational.

Reducing air pollution through clean energy sources could help save 400,000 American lives by 2050, according to Princeton University’s 2021 Net Zero America study.

“Coal is really out there in terms of the bad impacts,” Paltsev said. “So, at this point, even though wind and solar isn’t at zero emissions, it’s still better.”

Getting green clean

But even with clean energy’s clear track record of producing less pollution and earth-warming gases, its downside shouldn’t be ignored, argued Dustin Mulvaney, an environmental studies professor at San Jose State University.

Today, many solar panels and batteries contain toxic chemicals that could be hazardous to human health, but still slip under the regulatory radar.

A case in point: The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in December banned the use of trichloroethylene, which increases risks of certain cancers, in nearly every industry. Battery manufacturers, however, don’t have to phase out their use for 20 years.

“Here’s a hazardous chemical that’s in the battery supply chain that is not necessarily being adequately addressed,” said Mulvaney. “The EPA is putting this green halo on batteries, saying we forgive all of the bad sides to this.”

Mining lithium for electric-vehicle batteries is notoriously bad for the environment, using vast amounts of water in sometimes arid locations while employing heavy machinery that generates tons of emissions.

Silicon mining for solar panels also poses major health risks to workers, who face permanent and sometimes fatal lung diseases by inhaling toxic silica dust.

Mining can also pollute groundwater and degrade soil.

Most solar panels, wind turbines and some batteries also end up in landfills at the end of their lifecycle, which negatively impacts the environment.

Although the research is clear that clean energy produces fewer carbon emissions than fossil fuels, there currently is no metric measuring the overall, life-to-death environmental impact of green technologies, noted Paltsev with MIT.

Mulvaney argued that although it’s imperative to reduce the impacts of climate change through green energy, the people who do deal with its negative side effects, like polluted groundwater or increased health risks, shouldn’t be ignored.

“I think it’s dangerous to dismiss these impacts,” he said. “Even if 7 billion people benefit and only 20 people suffer on the planet, I think those 20 people deserve attention.”

Approaching zero

But new technology and improved manufacturing processes for clean energy sources are quickly diminishing those adverse impacts.

Companies like Arizona-based First Solar have developed a panel that doesn’t use silicon, greatly reducing its carbon footprint and water usage, compared to traditional arrays.

The publicly traded company with facilities in four countries also started the first global solar recycling program, and today recovers 90% of the materials in each module it produces.

The American Battery Technology Company is innovating ways to recycle lithium batteries and extract the rare metals inside to sell back into the battery-supply chain. The system reduces the need for mining and produces American-sourced metals with less environmental impact, according to the company.

Even China, where about 80% of all solar panels are manufactured, has since 2011 halved the CO2 produced through its manufacturing processes, according to the International Energy Agency. Still, total emissions from solar manufacturing there have almost quadrupled in the same time as production skyrockets.

Solar panels can be recycled, O’Shea said. His solar array company has replaced a few dozen out of the thousands it’s installed since transitioning to installing the arrays in the mid-90s. Those were broken by hail, the occasional golf ball or vandalism.

While those panels went back to the manufacturer to be recycled, others that still function could get a second life, O’Shea said.

Advances in photovoltaics have improved a panel’s efficiency from converting 17% of solar energy to electricity up to 23%.

That’s led some utility-scale array operators to upgrade their panels, as even a small increase in efficiency adds up over time and across thousands of panels, O’Shea said. If the old ones still function, they can be refurbished and resold.

“So if it tests properly … it can still be very viable for 15 years or more,” he said.

Paltsev said how quickly green energy can move toward net-zero emissions in the U.S. really depends on policymakers and the economic incentives that they can provide.

That matters, he argued, because reduced emissions from clean energy won’t be enough to curb climate change in the long run. Greenhouse gases are also coming from non-energy sources like agriculture and deforestation, Paltsev noted.

Until zero emissions are reached across the globe, temperatures will continue to rise and contribute to a surge in catastrophic weather events around world.

“At some point, I think there will be a huge demand for much more aggressive actions, because when you see things which are destroying your way of life, you will start asking more and more loudly that policymakers do something,” he said.",https://www.cnhi.com/wp-content/themes/cnhi/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-11-30 08:04:39.099280

""It shows how to accelerate those retirements using drivers that worked with other retired or soon-to-be retired coal plants.""","A recent study led to the development of a comprehensive framework that policymakers can use to retire America's coal plants forever.

The study, published in Nature Energy, was conducted by a team of researchers at the University of California, Santa Barbara. A Tech Xplore article said that the goal was to develop a strategy to speed up the country's transition away from coal power.

Although many coal plants have already shut down, over 100 remain active with no retirement plans, per the outlet. The plants' continued operation could make it more difficult to meet carbon pollution goals meant to protect air quality and health.

But shutting down coal plant operations can be more complicated than one might realize.

""Our goal was to build tools that reflect that complexity, so different actors can take on different facets of the problem,"" said study lead Sidney Gathrid, for whom the project started as a senior thesis. ""There's no one straightforward path, and we wanted to do research that represented that reality.""

The researchers' framework has two major points that policymakers could use to inform their decisions.

One is the ""contextual retirement vulnerability"" score, which measures a coal plant's likelihood of shutting down. The other is ""retirement archetypes"" — patterns that explain why plants may close, such as economic, health-based, and political factors.

Burning coal can have a variety of negative impacts on human health. For example, the pollutants from burning coal can lead to respiratory concerns, lung disease, and brain damage, per the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Coal power plants can also affect the environment. The Union of Concerned Scientists stated that ash may contaminate waterways, impacting recreation and drinking supplies.

That makes this new framework an exciting opportunity to close the coal plants that have had lasting impacts on people and the planet.

Some research suggests that coal use in the U.S. has reached its lowest since the 1960s. Another study discovered that most coal plants cost more to maintain than it would to replace them with wind or solar.

""What's exciting is that this framework doesn't just describe which plants might retire,"" said senior author and professor Grace Wu. ""It shows how to accelerate those retirements using drivers that worked with other retired or soon-to-be retired coal plants.""

The scientists involved in the study believe the framework could even be adapted for other energy policy efforts. Wu said: ""It's flexible, transparent and reproducible — exactly what we need to make smarter, more strategic decisions about the energy transition.""",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/OX.727hkan2HkayN4JFviw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_cool_down_737/9b332861fed2429d98ccbac82e6e6773,N,,2025-11-30 06:58:27.245509

JEFF ROLANDER

VICE PRESIDENT OF CLAIMS AND CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE, FAYE, RICHMOND

After almost 20 years working for Allianz Group subsidiaries, Jeff Rolander left the French corporation in late 2021 to join Richmond travel insurance startup Faye, drawn by its focus on customer loyalty and retention. Following his most recent promotion, Rolander oversees the claims and frontline teams, comprising almost all of Faye’s roughly 50-person local workforce.

Founded in 2019 and owned by Zenner, Faye achieved $100 million in sales revenue this year, and Time magazine included the company on its Best Inventions of 2025 list. Its app allows customers to file claims quickly and to keep them in a virtual wallet, as well as offering a “cancel for any reason” coverage option.

Faye’s corporate office is in Delaware, but it has major hubs in Richmond and Tel Aviv. The company has leased an office in Henrico County, and it anticipates more growth in 2026. With about 150 employees worldwide, the company hopes to grow its local headcount by 35% within the next year.

GWENN ROSENER

CEO, FLEXPROFESSIONALS, FAIRFAX

In 2010, Gwenn Rosener co-founded her staffing firm, FlexProfessionals, which even pre-pandemic has focused on finding remote and hybrid jobs for women with family demands. The company has worked with about 1,000 companies over the past decade and a half, and many of its placements are in accounting, sales, marketing and human resources at organizations throughout Northern Virginia.

Before starting FlexProfessionals, Rosener was a systems engineer at General Electric and a senior manager at Capgemini, the French multinational IT company that purchased Ernst & Young Consulting in 2000.

Amid federal spending cuts and job layoffs in the private and public sectors, Rosener and her colleagues have been very busy fielding calls this year. Speaking this summer, Rosener said that many of the former federal workers she’s spoken with never expected to go through another job search after landing what used to be dependably secure employment.

The regulatory environment continues evolving in ways that generally favour silver demand growth.
Disclaimer: This analysis contains forward-looking statements regarding silver market dynamics, industrial demand projections, and price scenarios.","What Economic Forces Are Driving Silver's Historic Price Surge?

The precious metals landscape has transformed dramatically as global monetary systems face unprecedented stress. While traditional economic models suggested moderate commodity appreciation, the convergence of multiple destabilizing forces has created conditions far beyond conventional forecasting parameters. Furthermore, silver's rise to all-time highs reflects deeper structural shifts that extend well beyond typical supply-demand dynamics.

Monetary Policy Shifts Creating Perfect Storm Conditions

Federal Reserve policy pivots have fundamentally altered opportunity cost calculations across asset classes. When central bank officials signal dovish positioning amid persistent inflationary pressures, non-yielding assets like precious metals suddenly appear more attractive relative to debt instruments offering negative real returns.

Interest rate cut speculation has amplified this dynamic considerably. Market participants increasingly view precious metals as essential portfolio components when monetary authorities prioritise employment metrics over price stability concerns. This environment particularly favours silver given its dual role as both monetary metal and industrial commodity.

Currency debasement concerns now extend beyond traditional dollar-skeptic demographics. Institutional investors increasingly recognise that monetary expansion policies create wealth preservation challenges that standard portfolio diversification cannot adequately address. In addition, the silver market squeeze impact demonstrates how monetary uncertainty translates into tangible market dynamics.

Central bank coordination failures have created additional monetary uncertainty. When major economies pursue conflicting policy objectives, currency volatility increases substantially, driving demand for assets with intrinsic value independent of government backing.

Inflation Persistence Rewarding Hard Asset Positioning

Consumer price index data continues revealing elevated inflation levels despite aggressive policy interventions. This persistence validates precious metals allocation strategies that many investors adopted during initial inflationary phases but later questioned during temporary price corrections.

Real interest rates have turned negative across multiple developed economies. When inflation-adjusted returns on government bonds and bank deposits become negative, precious metals offer compelling alternatives despite their lack of yield generation.

Currency purchasing power erosion has accelerated wealth preservation demand among high-net-worth individuals. Historical analysis demonstrates that during periods of sustained monetary expansion, silver often outperforms other inflation hedges due to its industrial demand component creating additional price support.

Historical inflation hedging performance validates silver allocation strategies employed by sophisticated investors. During the 1970s inflationary period, silver achieved record returns significantly exceeding those of gold, real estate, and equity markets, establishing precedents that current market participants reference when making allocation decisions.

How Are Industrial Demand Dynamics Reshaping Silver Market Fundamentals?

Industrial consumption patterns have evolved beyond historical precedents as technological transformation accelerates. The electrification megatrend encompasses transportation, energy generation, storage systems, and digital infrastructure, all requiring substantial silver quantities for optimal performance characteristics.

Green Energy Transition Driving Structural Consumption Growth

Solar panel installations require approximately 20 grams of silver per unit manufactured. As renewable energy mandates expand globally, this consumption base continues growing exponentially. Photovoltaic efficiency depends heavily on silver's superior electrical conductivity properties, making substitution technically challenging without performance degradation.

Electric vehicle production consumes unprecedented silver quantities compared to traditional automotive manufacturing. Each electric vehicle requires significantly more silver than conventional automobiles due to enhanced electrical systems, battery management components, and charging infrastructure requirements.

Renewable energy infrastructure demands conductive metal components throughout power generation, transmission, and storage systems. Wind turbines, smart grid technology, and energy storage systems all incorporate substantial silver quantities, creating sustained industrial demand independent of financial market conditions.

The electrification megatrend represents a multi-decade demand trajectory that supply planners struggle to accommodate. Unlike cyclical industrial demands that fluctuate with economic conditions, this structural transformation appears irreversible given climate policy commitments worldwide.

Application Annual Demand (Million Oz) Growth Rate (YoY) Photovoltaics 140 +18% Electronics 240 +8% Automotive 55 +25% Medical Devices 15 +12%

Supply Constraints Amplifying Price Discovery Mechanisms

Primary mine production has stagnated due to ore grade deterioration across major producing regions. Geological surveys indicate that easily accessible high-grade silver deposits have been largely exploited, forcing miners to process increasingly lower-grade materials at higher operational costs.

Environmental regulations now restrict new project development in many jurisdictions. Permitting processes extend development timelines far beyond historical norms, creating supply response delays that cannot accommodate rapid demand growth in emerging applications.

Geopolitical tensions disrupt traditional supply chains regularly. Trade disputes, sanctions, and resource nationalism policies affect silver flows between major producing and consuming nations, creating additional supply uncertainty that market participants must price accordingly.

Recycling rates remain insufficient to offset consumption growth. While electronic waste contains substantial silver quantities, recovery processes are energy-intensive and economically viable only at elevated price levels, limiting recycled supply elasticity during price increases.

What Geopolitical Catalysts Are Accelerating Safe-Haven Demand?

International trade tensions have escalated beyond conventional diplomatic frameworks. Recent announcements regarding potential tariff increases reaching 100% on strategic commodities signal a fundamental shift toward economic nationalism that undermines global supply chain efficiency.

Trade War Escalation Creating Market Uncertainty

Rare earth export controls fragment global supply networks in ways that affect multiple industries simultaneously. When nations weaponise resource access, international businesses must develop alternative sourcing strategies that often prove more expensive and less reliable than previous arrangements.

Technology transfer restrictions disrupt industrial partnerships that previously facilitated efficient production processes. These disruptions force companies to develop domestic capabilities or alternative international relationships, creating transitional periods characterised by increased costs and operational uncertainty.

Furthermore, the tariff impacts on silver demonstrate how economic nationalism policies reshape international commerce toward bilateral rather than multilateral frameworks. This transformation reduces efficiency gains from comparative advantage while increasing transaction costs across international borders.

Government Shutdown Aftermath Revealing Systemic Vulnerabilities

Federal operations disruptions highlight institutional fragility that concerns market participants. When government functions cease temporarily, economic data collection suffers, policy implementation delays occur, and market confidence decreases regarding institutional stability.

Economic data collection interruptions create information gaps that complicate investment decision-making. Missing economic indicators force market participants to rely on incomplete information, increasing uncertainty premiums across asset classes.

Policy implementation delays generate market volatility as businesses postpone investment decisions pending clarity regarding regulatory frameworks. This uncertainty particularly affects long-term industrial projects requiring substantial capital commitments.

Debt ceiling concerns resurface despite temporary resolutions. Each recurring debt ceiling debate undermines confidence in fiscal sustainability while highlighting political dysfunction that could eventually threaten economic stability.

How Do Current Silver Valuations Compare to Historical Precedents?

Current silver valuations appear modest when examined through historical inflation-adjusted analysis. Market participants increasingly recognise that nominal price comparisons provide misleading perspectives without considering currency debasement effects over extended periods.

Inflation-Adjusted Price Analysis Revealing Undervaluation

The 1980 peak equivalent exceeds $180 in current purchasing power terms. This comparison suggests substantial upside potential exists if similar monetary conditions develop, though market participants acknowledge that contemporary industrial demand provides additional price support not present during previous cycles.

Real price performance has lagged behind monetary expansion significantly. Federal Reserve balance sheet growth over the past two decades far exceeds silver's rise to all-time highs, indicating that monetary metals have not kept pace with currency creation rates.

Asset class rotation potential suggests significant upside opportunities. When institutional investors recognise that traditional portfolio allocations inadequately address monetary debasement risks, precious metals allocation increases often occur rapidly and substantially.

Risk-adjusted returns favour precious metals allocation within diversified portfolios. Academic studies demonstrate that modest precious metals allocations improve portfolio risk-return characteristics across various economic scenarios.

A 1923 US Silver Peace Dollar containing 0.7734 troy ounces now holds $44.15 in metal value alone, representing 4,315% currency debasement over 102 years.

Gold-Silver Ratio Dynamics Indicating Relative Opportunity

The current 74.6x ratio exists below the century average of 69.4x, suggesting potential mean reversion opportunities. Historical analysis indicates that extreme ratio readings often precede significant silver outperformance periods.

Industrial demand creates structural ratio compression pressures. Unlike gold, silver's substantial industrial consumption provides price support that becomes particularly important during economic expansion phases when industrial activity accelerates.

Investment flows increasingly favour higher-beta precious metals exposure. When investors seek precious metals exposure, silver's greater volatility appeals to those seeking enhanced return potential despite increased risk characteristics.

However, comprehensive gold-silver ratio analysis reveals complex dynamics beyond simple mean reversion expectations.

What Supply-Demand Imbalances Are Supporting Price Momentum?

Market fundamentals reveal structural deficit conditions that traditional economic models struggle to accommodate. Annual consumption now exceeds mine production by over 200 million ounces, creating inventory drawdown pressures that affect market dynamics substantially.

Structural Deficit Conditions Tightening Physical Markets

Exchange-traded product inflows accelerate inventory drawdown from available stockpiles. When institutional investors seek silver exposure through ETF purchases, these products must acquire physical metal, removing supply from industrial markets.

Industrial stockpiling creates additional demand pressure beyond immediate consumption requirements. Manufacturers increasingly maintain larger inventories to ensure production continuity amid supply chain disruptions, effectively removing metal from available markets.

Speculative positioning amplifies price volatility in both directions. When trend-following strategies dominate futures market activity, price movements often exceed levels justified by fundamental supply-demand conditions alone.

Furthermore, silver supply deficits highlight the structural challenges facing market equilibrium.

Mine Development Pipeline Insufficient for Demand Growth

New project economics require silver prices above $40 for development viability. At current cost structures, most potential projects cannot generate adequate returns unless prices remain elevated substantially above historical averages.

Permitting delays extend development timelines beyond demand curve projections. Environmental review processes now require multiple years for completion, making supply response lag substantially behind demand growth in emerging applications.

Capital allocation favours higher-margin base metals projects over silver-focused developments. Mining companies typically prioritise copper, zinc, and nickel projects that offer superior return profiles compared to primary silver operations.

Exploration budgets have declined despite elevated commodity prices. Mining companies focus capital on developing known deposits rather than discovering new resources, limiting long-term supply growth potential.

Which Investment Strategies Are Capitalising on Silver's Momentum?

Investment approaches vary significantly across market participant categories. Institutional investors typically favour liquid instruments that provide silver exposure without storage complications, while sophisticated individual investors often pursue physical allocation strategies.

Exchange-Traded Product Flows Accelerating Price Discovery

ETF holdings have reached multi-year highs amid institutional adoption. These products provide convenient silver exposure for investors who cannot or prefer not to hold physical metal directly, creating substantial demand flows.

Futures positioning indicates continued bullish sentiment among managed money participants. Commitment of Traders data reveals speculative long positions approaching historical extremes, suggesting widespread optimism regarding price direction.

Options market activity reflects elevated volatility expectations. Implied volatility levels indicate that market participants anticipate significant price movements, creating opportunities for strategies that benefit from volatility expansion.

Retail investor participation expands through accessible products. Simplified investment vehicles enable broader participation in silver markets, creating additional demand from demographics previously unable to obtain meaningful exposure.

Consequently, sophisticated silver price strategies have evolved to capitalise on these market dynamics.

Mining Equity Leverage Amplifying Returns

Silver miners generate substantial operational leverage to underlying metal prices. When silver prices increase, mining companies benefit from fixed cost structures that amplify margin expansion effects significantly.

Production cost curves support margin expansion opportunities. Many producers operate with all-in sustaining costs below current price levels, creating substantial free cash flow generation potential at elevated prices.

Exploration upside creates additional value catalysts beyond current production profiles. Successful exploration programmes can substantially increase company valuations independent of prevailing metal prices.

Dividend policies evolve to reward shareholder returns. Mining companies increasingly return cash to shareholders through dividend payments and share buyback programmes, making equity ownership more attractive.

What Technical Indicators Support Continued Price Advancement?

Technical analysis reveals multiple confirmation signals suggesting sustained bullish momentum. Chart patterns, momentum oscillators, and volume characteristics align to support continued price advancement beyond current levels.

Momentum Signals Confirming Bullish Trajectory

Weekly parabolic trends indicate sustained buying pressure across extended periods. When parabolic indicators remain bullish across multiple timeframes simultaneously, trend continuation probability increases substantially.

Volume patterns support price breakout authenticity. Increasing volume during price advances suggests genuine participation rather than technical manipulation, providing confidence regarding trend sustainability.

Resistance level penetration creates new technical floors. Previous resistance zones often become support levels during subsequent corrections, establishing higher price ranges for future trading activity.

Moving average configurations signal trend continuation. When short-term averages remain above longer-term counterparts with expanding distances, momentum typically persists until configuration changes occur.

Market Structure Analysis Revealing Institutional Participation

Large speculator positioning has reached multi-year highs according to regulatory filings. Institutional participation provides price support during corrections while creating additional upward pressure during advances.

Commercial hedging activity declined relative to historical norms. When traditional short hedgers reduce positions, upward price pressure typically increases due to reduced selling pressure from producers.

Open interest expansion indicates genuine demand growth rather than position rotation. Increasing open interest during price advances suggests new capital entering markets rather than existing position adjustments.

Volatility patterns remain consistent with structural market shifts. Price volatility characteristics differ during fundamental trend changes compared to cyclical corrections, suggesting underlying demand changes.

How Might Regulatory Changes Impact Silver Market Dynamics?

Regulatory frameworks continue evolving in ways that favour silver-intensive technologies. Environmental mandates, energy transition policies, and financial market regulations all influence silver demand and investment flows substantially.

Environmental Policies Accelerating Industrial Demand

Carbon reduction mandates require silver-intensive technologies for implementation. Solar panels, electric vehicles, and energy storage systems all depend heavily on silver's unique properties, creating policy-driven demand growth.

Renewable energy subsidies support photovoltaic deployment across multiple jurisdictions. Government incentives make solar installations economically attractive, directly increasing silver consumption for electrical components.

Electric vehicle incentives drive automotive consumption beyond market-driven adoption rates. Tax credits and purchase subsidies accelerate EV adoption, creating additional silver demand from enhanced electrical systems.

Energy storage regulations favour silver-dependent solutions. Grid-scale storage requirements often specify technologies that incorporate substantial silver quantities for optimal performance characteristics.

Financial Market Regulations Affecting Investment Flows

Basel III implementation potentially supports physical precious metals demand. Banking regulations that require higher capital reserves for paper gold holdings may encourage physical allocation strategies among institutional investors.

Commodity position limits influence futures market structure. Regulatory constraints on speculative position sizes may reduce paper market influence while increasing physical market importance for price discovery.

Central bank reserve diversification policies increasingly include precious metals considerations. Monetary authorities seek alternatives to dollar-denominated assets, potentially creating additional institutional demand.

Tax policy changes affect investment vehicle preferences. Favourable tax treatment for specific precious metals investment structures influences capital allocation decisions among tax-sensitive investors.

What Scenarios Could Sustain Silver's All-Time High Trajectory?

Multiple scenario paths support continued silver price advancement beyond current levels. The convergence of monetary, industrial, and geopolitical factors creates conditions where various outcomes lead to sustained demand growth.

Bull Case: Convergence of Multiple Growth Drivers

Industrial demand growth exceeding 15% annually through 2027 represents a realistic outcome given current technology adoption trajectories. Solar installations, electric vehicle production, and energy storage deployment all support this growth scenario.

Monetary policy remaining accommodative amid persistent inflation creates continued precious metals demand. If central banks prioritise employment over price stability, negative real interest rates support non-yielding asset allocation.

Geopolitical tensions escalating safe-haven premium requirements affects portfolio allocation decisions. International conflict, trade disputes, and currency instability all favour assets with intrinsic value characteristics.

Supply disruptions creating acute shortage conditions become increasingly probable. Mining accidents, labour disputes, and geopolitical restrictions can rapidly tighten physical markets beyond normal supply-demand dynamics.

Base Case: Gradual Price Appreciation with Periodic Volatility

Steady industrial demand growth supporting a $45-55 price range reflects continued technology adoption without acceleration. This scenario assumes normal economic growth rates with gradual energy transition implementation.

Moderate monetary policy normalisation limits downside risk while constraining upside potential. Gradual interest rate adjustments allow economic adaptation without creating severe precious metals headwinds.

Technological substitution occurring gradually enables market adaptation without demand destruction. Alternative materials development proceeds slowly enough to allow supply adjustments and price optimisation.

New mine supply partially offsets consumption growth through gradual capacity expansion. Existing operations increase production while new projects come online with sufficient lead times to moderate price pressures.

What Are the Risk Factors?

Aggressive interest rate increases could reduce precious metals appeal substantially. Rapid monetary tightening that creates attractive real yields on fixed income instruments typically pressures non-yielding assets.

Technological breakthroughs enabling silver substitution in key applications represent long-term risks. Alternative materials development could eventually reduce industrial demand for critical applications.

Economic recession dampening industrial consumption requirements affects near-term demand projections. Reduced manufacturing activity directly impacts silver consumption across multiple applications.

Large-scale mine discoveries could significantly expand supply outlook. Major new deposits with favourable development characteristics could alter long-term supply-demand projections substantially.

Positioning for Silver's Next Phase

Silver's rise to all-time highs reflects fundamental shifts across monetary, industrial, and geopolitical landscapes. The structural supply deficit, combined with accelerating green energy adoption and persistent inflation concerns, creates conditions supporting continued upward pressure. While short-term volatility remains inevitable given silver's historical price characteristics, the underlying drivers appear sustainable across multiple economic scenarios.

The industrial demand transformation represents perhaps the most significant long-term factor supporting silver prices. Unlike previous precious metals rallies driven primarily by monetary concerns, current conditions feature substantial industrial consumption growth that provides price support independent of financial market sentiment. This dual-demand characteristic distinguishes silver from other precious metals and suggests greater resilience during potential economic transitions.

Investment strategies capitalising on silver's momentum vary significantly across risk preferences and time horizons. Direct physical ownership provides maximum exposure with storage considerations, while ETF products offer liquidity advantages for tactical allocation adjustments. Mining equity exposure amplifies returns but introduces additional operational and management risks that require careful evaluation.

The regulatory environment continues evolving in ways that generally favour silver demand growth. Environmental policies, energy transition mandates, and financial market regulations all create conditions supporting increased silver utilisation and investment demand. These policy trends appear unlikely to reverse given climate commitments and energy security concerns.

Market participants should remain cognisant of potential risk factors that could disrupt silver's rise to all-time highs. Aggressive monetary tightening, technological substitution breakthroughs, or major supply discoveries could alter market dynamics substantially. However, current conditions suggest these risks represent longer-term considerations rather than immediate threats to price advancement.

Analysis from Reuters highlights silver's outperformance compared to other precious metals, reinforcing the fundamental drivers supporting current market dynamics.

Co-hosted with Nigeria’s Ministry of Petroleum Resources and the African Energy Commission (AFREC), the workshop explored regional opportunities and challenges, while sharing international best practices and cost-effective solutions.

The event brought together over 100 participants from across Africa and beyond, including government officials, regulators, industry representatives and international organisations.

In addition to the host country, Nigeria, participants from eight other African countries joined from across the continent, representing Cameroon, Côte d’Ivoire, Gabon, Ghana, Mauritania, Mozambique, Senegal and Uganda.

It follows two previous regional workshops on methane abatement that have taken place as part of the IEA’s Global Methane Engagement Programme.

The first, held in October 2024 in Baku with Azerbaijan’s COP29 Presidency, focused on the Caucasus and Central Asia.

The second took place in Lima in July 2025 in partnership with the Latin American Energy Organization (OLADE) and Peru’s Ministry of Energy, with a focus on Latin America and the Caribbean.

At each event, experts highlighted the latest data on methane emissions and methods for reducing them.

Participants discussed how pledges could be turned into supportive plans, policies and regulations in their respective regions, as well as the data tools available for monitoring progress and the options available for financing abatement projects.

A key focus has also been on opportunities for regional cooperation.

The Engagement Programme has now brought together over 500 people from 35 countries to discuss pathways for reducing methane emissions.

The next instalment will take place in early next year, with a focus on the Middle East and North Africa region.

According to the IEA’s Global Methane Tracker 2025, methane emissions from fossil fuels remain stubbornly high despite improvements in data and transparency.

Current pledges by companies and countries to tackle methane cover 80% of global oil and gas production.

Around 70% of annual methane emissions from the energy sector could be avoided with existing technologies.

Meanwhile, a significant share of abatement measures could pay for themselves within a year, since the gas that is captured can be sold.

The IEA also released two new reports related to methane abatement this week. Pledges to Progress 2025 – produced in partnership with the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the International Methane Emissions Observatory (IMEO) and the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) – provides an initial assessment of the actions taken by over 100 oil and gas companies to deliver on their ambitions to reduce emissions.",https://cms360.alhilalgroup.com//source/TA/2025/11/30/TA_20251130105553.jpg,N,,2025-11-30 10:02:55.790217

The board has continued to express interest in wanting a solar deal.
[ Dixon school board may sign onto solar plan to save energy costs ] In late 2022, the district moved forward on a solar project with Chicago-based energy company Econergy that estimated about $2 million in energy cost savings over 25 years.
Based on the lack of progress on the project, school board members voted to terminate those contracts in April 2025, but said they'd still like to pursue solar options.

Under the agreement approved Wednesday, Nov. 19, with solar development firm Solar One, the district will purchase the power at a fixed rate of 3.6 cents per kilowatt hour for seven years. Dixon Public Schools Business Manager Marc Campbell said that's less than what it currently pays ComEd at a rate of 4.38 cents per kilowatt hour plus a distribution fee on each kilowatt.

""There is an immediate savings on the supply that it provides in the future. The board has continued to express interest in wanting a solar deal. This appears to be, in our opinion, one of the good ones that we can kind of stand on,"" Campbell said.

[ Dixon school board may sign onto solar plan to save energy costs ]

In late 2022, the district moved forward on a solar project with Chicago-based energy company Econergy that estimated about $2 million in energy cost savings over 25 years. Based on the lack of progress on the project, school board members voted to terminate those contracts in April 2025, but said they'd still like to pursue solar options.

""We're moving on and we're moving forward. We're looking to the future,"" Campbell said.

The contract is a 15-year commitment to operate the system, which has a life of 30 years. At the end of the first seven years, the district can either choose to extend its fixed rate for another eight years or buy the equipment at a fair market value with the option to pay for it at 0% interest over 10 years, according to the agreement.

Solar One Lead Industrial Developer Shawn Stonesifer, who's a 1998 Dixon High School graduate, said it's estimated to save the district $82,000 in the first year, about $70,000 each of the following six years and about $100,000 to $120,000 a year for eight years after that if the district purchases the system.

Those estimates are calculated using the district's past energy bills, with a 1.26% annual rate increase to account for inflation, Stonesifer said.

Campbell said the only concern he has about the project with Solar One is how fast the district needs to move on its decision.

""The 'One Big Beautiful Bill' has made significant changes in the industry. The biggest being timeline and expiration of credits and incentives,"" Campbell said.

President Donald Trump's ""One Big Beautiful Bill"" was signed into law in July. It includes large tax cuts in multiple areas, along with shifting the federal focus from clean energy to expanding domestic oil and gas production, according to whitehouse.gov.

In 2022 and 2023, ""everybody rushed to the table. There's lots and lots of solar developers all of a sudden,"" Stonesifer said.

During those years, under former President Joe Biden's administration, state and federal governments signed legislation like the federal Inflation Reduction Act in 2022 that provided tax credits and other incentives to clean energy projects.

""The 'One Big Beautiful Bill' put an end to some of those subsidies, so there's a lot of urgency to get this knocked out now,"" Stonesifer said.

Starting at the end of December, solar projects will have to be compliant with new requirements that will increase the cost of purchasing rates, Stonesifer said.

""We have this nice little window here where we can get a project that's going to save the district a lot of money over a long period of time,"" Stonesifer said.

Campbell reminded the board that, based on the length of the contract, it will most likely be passed along to a new group of board members and district administrators.

""We need to make sure that we understand that that's a serious thing to do,"" Campbell said.

""I think it's got to be done for financial reasons and environmental reasons,"" Board President Linda Wegner said.

Stonesifer said the next steps are for Solar One to purchase the equipment before the new rules kick in and complete final engineering and design plans.

As of now, the plan is for panels to be installed on the roof of DHS and Washington Elementary and in the field behind Jefferson Elementary and Reagan Middle School. Building is expected to start in late summer 2026, Stonesifer said.",https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo-1200x1200.png,N,,2025-11-30 08:57:45.941813

To transport the equipment from shipping barges to the CEP construction site, crews will move the modules over River Road using a temporary heavy-haul bridge.
Temporary road closures are scheduled to begin in early December and last through February, when the temporary bridge is expected to be fully deconstructed.
Cornerstone Energy Park has grown into a multimillion-dollar industrial campus and is home to several companies that operate both independently and collaboratively.
And, with decades of history and major projects pointing to a cleaner, more resilient future, Cornerstone Energy Park remains a vital pillar of Jefferson Parish’s industrial landscape.","Cornerstone Chemical Company, LLC, a fixture of industry and community life in Waggaman for more than 70 years, is helping to usher in a new chapter of energy innovation and economic development in Jefferson Parish. Through continued modernization of the Cornerstone Energy Park (CEP) and major new investments from companies that share its commitment to safety, sustainability and long-term growth, the site is emerging as one of the Gulf Coast’s most important hubs for advanced manufacturing.

This transition will be especially visible in the coming months as UBE C1 Chemicals America (UCCA) begins the next phase of construction on a $500 million production facility inside CEP. The project will establish the first reliable U.S. supply of critical components used in energy storage systems — materials essential to building a more sustainable national energy future.

“This is an exciting time for Cornerstone Energy Park as we continue to forge partnerships focused on creating a sustainable future for the site,” said Jacques Byrd, Cornerstone Vice President of Site Development. “Please pardon our progress as we work to construct this vital facility and transition the Cornerstone Energy Park for a sustainable future.”

To construct the new facility efficiently and responsibly, UCCA is employing modular construction, a method increasingly used in advanced manufacturing projects around the world. In modular construction, equipment is built in smaller components off-site, transported by barge, and then assembled on location.

“Think of modular construction as putting together the pieces of a puzzle,” said UCCA President and CEO Tom Yura. “The pieces are built elsewhere, and the puzzle is assembled on-site. It’s a smarter way to build because it minimizes disruption to the community and reduces the duration of construction.”

These pre-built modules offer multiple advantages: improved efficiency and reduced construction time. To transport the equipment from shipping barges to the CEP construction site, crews will move the modules over River Road using a temporary heavy-haul bridge.

UCCA has selected Morimatsu, a contractor with more than 20 years of global experience moving modular components using hydraulic systems. “Morimatsu brings valuable knowledge and experience to assure project safety and efficiency,” Yura said.

As the modular equipment arrives and is transported onto the site, residents should expect intermittent road closures along River Road. Installation of the temporary bridge will be completed in early to mid-December. Shortly after, the modules will begin crossing the temporary bridge into CEP.

Temporary road closures are scheduled to begin in early December and last through February, when the temporary bridge is expected to be fully deconstructed. Until then, periodic road closures, typically lasting less than one hour, will occur outside of peak travel times.

“We are working with local authorities to help keep the community informed on River Road traffic conditions throughout the construction process,” said Ainslie Blanke, Cornerstone’s senior marketing and communications advisor. “Thank you for your patience as we make Jefferson Parish one of the country’s leaders in sustainable energy.”

Cornerstone and UCCA are coordinating with the Jefferson Parish Sheriff’s Office, U.S. Coast Guard, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Jefferson Parish Levee District and the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development to ensure all work is completed safely and efficiently.

Cornerstone Energy Park has grown into a multimillion-dollar industrial campus and is home to several companies that operate both independently and collaboratively. The shared focus aims to produce essential materials, support local jobs and prepare Louisiana’s petrochemical sector for a more sustainable future.

The UCCA facility represents the first U.S. production of its kind and deepens Jefferson Parish’s role as a location of choice for energy-forward projects. With sustainability top of mind, CEP and its site companies continue to upgrade technology and strengthen environmental stewardship.

“CEP is focused on transitioning the site for the future,” Byrd said. “The companies on our site share a commitment to safety, health and the environment. That unity is key to building long-term growth.”

As construction accelerates, the UCCA facility stands as both an industrial milestone and a signal of what’s to come: more green-energy jobs, enhanced manufacturing capacity and a stronger local economy built on innovation. And, with decades of history and major projects pointing to a cleaner, more resilient future, Cornerstone Energy Park remains a vital pillar of Jefferson Parish’s industrial landscape.

Now with shale technology, you go down it until you hit that layer and then you go horizontally.
The shale revolution at this point is about 20 years old.
So in the United States, unless you have signed it away, you own the mineral rights on your land.
And so Argentina already has the second most successful shale industry in the world.","Hey everybody, Peter Zeihan here. Coming to you from Colorado. Today we’re taking a question from our Patreon page, specifically from one of our friends down in Australia, wondering if it would be possible for Australia to recreate the sort of energy complex that the United States has, courtesy of the shale revolution. The United States is now just a gross over producer of both oil and natural gas.

It’s driven down energy costs in the country, especially electricity costs, which are now among the lowest in the world. And it’s generated a robust processing and manufacturing system with downstream work and a significant export industry, Australia having a smaller population, but almost as much land could they do it? I don’t want to say no, but there’s some things you have to keep in mind.

Number one, geology is just the first step. So in order to have a shale industry, you have to have a lot of sedimentary layers that are petroleum bearing that just the right age to generate oil, natural gas. And the United States has that because in the past, the North American continent, especially our part of it, has had a series of shallow seas.

And then geology would change, and then you’d get another shallow sea and you basically got these stacked layers so you can drill down and hit multiple petroleum producing zones. In fact, in some places in West Texas, you can have upwards of 20 layers that you can all access from one vertical. Now with shale technology, you go down it until you hit that layer and then you go horizontally.

And that brings us to the second thing. You need water. The way shale works is you make this suspension of water and sand, and that is pumped into the lateral through a series of holes that basically crack the, rock open and release the petroleum. And then back pressure pushes all the liquid out and eventually oil and natural gas comes to the surface.

Don’t have to pump the stuff, but you have to have the water to do it. And part of that folds into the third issue, which is proximity. You have to have relative proximity for your oil and natural gas production. Two population centers are places that can take the stuff for processing. And in this this the United States is pretty good.

We have shale zones in Texas, which of course can get pumped to corpus Christi in Houston. And the rest we’ve got some in Colorado which benefit the Denver area. We’ve got some in Ohio which can be pumped into the Northeast and Pennsylvania. Same thing. Australia’s problem is that most of the geology that looks promising is in the outback.

So not only is it a long ways away from any potential population centers, you’re in the middle of a literal desert, so the water access is more difficult. You can access groundwater that’s done in the United States, too. But all of these things incrementally raise the cost of development. Let’s see what else. Regulatory structure. This is one where a lot of countries, trip up shale wells, as a rule, generate somewhere from the hundreds of barrels to thousands of barrels a day, which sounds great, but it’s not like the mega wells you’re going to get a place like, say, Saudi Arabia.

So you’re going to have more of them and they’re more involved from a technical point of view for production. So you have to have a more advanced educational system to generate that sort of workforce. And the United States really does stand out among the world when it comes to petroleum engineers, because we’ve been doing it for so long.

The shale revolution at this point is about 20 years old. In the United States. Our first oil deposits were back in the mid 1800s. So this is something that we’ve been going and going and going. It’s not that the Australians don’t have that, but most of what the Australians have been doing for energy production in the last 30 years has been offshore, where they tap foreign labor almost as much as local labor.

So there’s there’s a labor crunch there. In addition, if you live in Houston, you can work in West Texas. If you live in Sydney or Brisbane, you’re probably not going to be working on the northwest shelf. It’s just too far. So linking these together, and then on the regulatory side, you have to be able to do things on the fly very, very quickly and have a regulatory structure.

That’s okay with that. So in Texas, the Texas Railroad Commission, which is the one that regulates the space issues, permits 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. They drill on Sundays, they drill on Christmas. And if you don’t have an institution set up to handle that, everything else gets pushed back. This is one of the reasons why the shale attempt in Poland just didn’t work out, because the poles tried to work European hours and it just didn’t fly.

The geology wasn’t as good either. But the most important thing, the single most important thing is landowners have to have an interest in the industry. So in the United States, unless you have signed it away, you own the mineral rights on your land. So if a petroleum company comes and wants to drill in your land, you get a chunk of the proceeds.

We’re the only country in the world that does it that way. So when the United Kingdom tried to kick in the shale that ten years ago, they discovered huge amounts of local opposition because the companies would take all of the money, and that would be that the locals had to deal with the noise and the traffic and all the rest, and they saw absolutely no benefit.

Australia is kind of in that camp. So if, if, if this is going to happen, it’s going to take a lot more money and put a lot of pressure on the labor force and require a regulatory and maybe even a legal overhaul of property rights in Australia in order to generate the sort of outcome that you might want to see.

There are three countries, however, that are worth keeping an eye on when it comes to shale that are closer than Australia to achieving something like the United States. The first, ironically, is Argentina. They already have preexisting infrastructure in a place called vacuum worth a dead cow fields which are very close to populated Argentina, including Buenos Aires. The socialist governments of the past set a price floor.

So anyone going to invest knows how much they’re going to get out. So even though the property law structures are weird and it’s Argentina. So if they’re very weird, if you know the rules of the game on the day that you start, you can get some projects going. And so Argentina already has the second most successful shale industry in the world.

The other two to watch are Mexico and Canada. both have a shale fields that in many ways are extensions of the American geography, especially northern Mexico. The weird thing about Canada in Mexico, though, is their closest population centers for most considerations around the American side of the border. So if we’re going to ever see a successful shale industry in those two countries, it will be because they’re accessing American infrastructure, population structure, processing infrastructure and basically linking into a greater North American energy grid.

Doesn’t mean it can’t happen, but if you’re in Ottawa or Mexico City developing a local energy sector to serve another country, let’s just call that a bit of a political complication.",https://zeihan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/oil-rona-header.jpg,N,,2025-11-30 01:58:25.108388

Not enough chargers have been built and the ones that do exist don’t work for all vehicles. Tesla has built the most substantial charging network and finally Stellantis has agreed to switch to the Tesla North American Charging System for some of its battery electric vehicles. That means starting in 2026, vehicles like the 2026 Dodge Charger Daytona and the 2026 Jeep Recon will be built with the NACS plugs. Jeep, Dodge and Chrysler have electrified vehicles that can be plugged in to charge. Ram is working on an extended range hybrid pickup.

The Tesla Plug Change Will be Phased in Gradually

Apparently, the adoption of the North American Charging System (NACS) for select Stellantis battery-electric vehicles will happen in phases. Starting in early 2026, in North America, existing BEVs, such as the Jeep Wagoneer S and Dodge Charger Daytona will be equipped to use the Tesla Supercharger network. Eventually the 2026 Jeep Recon and other future products will also be able to use the NACS network. There will be more details about adapter information for current Stellantis BEV models released in the future.

The change in charging plugs will start in North America in 2026. In 2027, vehicles in Japan and South Korea will be added to the NACS network. There are currently 28,000 Tesla superchargers in North America, Japan and South Korea.

Reluctance to Buy Electric Vehicles

Range anxiety and concerns about finding adequate charging facilities are two of the main reasons that people are reluctant to buy electric vehicles. All of the automakers have struggled with convincing customers that they will be able to charge vehicles quickly. Most complaints center around poor charging infrastructure, especially in rural or remote areas. Jeep has financed installing chargers at trailheads but still the outlets are few and far between. Often, when drivers do find charging facilities, they have been vandalized.

The collaboration between Stellantis and Tesla will certainly boost customer confidence in public charging. By unlocking broader access to charging infrastructure, Stellantis gives customers more choice, more coverage and more control over how, where and when they power their EVs.

New Mexico received the most of any state with more than $2.7 billion in payments.

The disbursements support a wide range of initiatives, including public infrastructure, education, emergency services, conservation and reclamation projects, and historic preservation. This year’s total represents the fifth-largest disbursement since 1982.

The Donald J. Trump administration has focused on combating inflation and reducing energy costs. These lower prices have helped keep more money in the pockets of American consumers while still providing critical funding to states, tribes and federal programs through ONRR’s disbursements. This year’s disbursements decreased from the previous year largely due to the drop in commodity prices.

ONRR’s disbursements were aided by the Trump administration’s priorities under Executive Order 14154, Unleashing American Energy, which directs federal agencies to remove regulatory barriers and encourage responsible energy development on public lands. Additionally, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which reduced the cost of doing business on public lands, making oil and gas development more economically attractive to industry, spurred domestic energy production while lowering commodity prices.

Fiscal year 2025 Disbursement Highlights:

$5.01 billion to the U.S. Treasury

$4.07 billion to 34 states

$2.98 billion to the Reclamation Fund

$1.05 billion to the Land and Water Conservation Fund

$1.00 billion to Tribes and individual Indian mineral owners

$350 million to federal agencies

$150 million to the Historic Preservation Fund

The $4.07 billion in state disbursements reflects revenue from mineral and energy production on federal lands within the states’ borders and offshore tracts in federal waters adjacent to states’ shores.

The states receiving the highest disbursements based on those activities are:

New Mexico

$2.76 billion

Wyoming

$544.87 million

Louisiana

$162.42 million

North Dakota

$114.95 million

Texas

$99.83 million

Mississippi

$52.34 million

Alabama

$51.73 million

California

$39.12 million

Alaska

$27.33 million

Montana

$27.02 million

The revenue disbursed to 33 federally recognized tribes and approximately 31,000 individual Indian mineral owners represent 100% of the revenues received for energy and mineral production activities on Indian lands. Tribes use these revenues to develop infrastructure, provide health care and education, and support other critical community development programs, such as senior centers, public safety projects and youth initiatives.

Since 1982, the Department has disbursed over $402 billion in mineral leasing revenues.

Prices have strengthened, and shares of Alcoa and Century Aluminum have rebounded after last spring’s tariff shock.
Domestic production slips into survival mode This shift has left the United States with only four active smelting operations.
Century Aluminum has secured a multi-year power deal in South Carolina to keep one of its plants viable through 2031.
Industry leaders warn that without government action, the United States will struggle to rebuild a capability many now consider strategically important.","The United States should be living through a renaissance in aluminium. Data centers, electric vehicles and the wider clean-energy buildout are pulling unprecedented volumes of the metal into server racks, cooling systems, power grids and vehicle frames. Prices have strengthened, and shares of Alcoa and Century Aluminum have rebounded after last spring’s tariff shock. Yet the companies behind the country’s remaining smelters say the boom is slipping away from them just as demand surges.

The problem is electricity. Turning alumina into metal requires vast, steady power — roughly 14 megawatt-hours for every tonne of aluminium. A single modern smelter draws as much energy as a mid-sized American city. For decades, the economics worked only when smelters locked in long-term power at around USD 30 to USD 40 per megawatt-hour. That equation has collapsed. The explosion of AI infrastructure has tech giants paying more than USD 100 per megawatt-hour to secure guaranteed supply, far beyond what metal producers can absorb. Industry executives admit they simply cannot match Big Tech’s bidding power.

Domestic production slips into survival mode

This shift has left the United States with only four active smelting operations. Output last year barely reached 670,000 tonnes — less than one percent of global production — and nowhere near enough to meet domestic needs. The country now relies heavily on Canadian imports, while China and Indonesia expand aggressively with cheaper energy and looser constraints. No new US smelter has been built in nearly half a century, and the sector’s decline has become structural.

Demand outpaces the country’s ability to supply

Ironically, the long-term fundamentals look stronger than ever. Automakers are substituting aluminium for steel as they electrify their fleets. Renewable power developers need the metal for turbines, solar frames and transmission hardware. And data center construction is rising so quickly that Bank of America expects US power demand to grow five to ten times faster over the coming decade. Yet Goldman Sachs forecasts that the wave of new global supply will push prices lower through 2026, compressing margins for the producers that remain.

Smelters search for lifelines

In this environment, companies are scrambling for stability. Century Aluminum has secured a multi-year power deal in South Carolina to keep one of its plants viable through 2031. Emirates Global Aluminium has announced plans for a new smelter in Oklahoma — an extraordinary move that would nearly double current US capacity if it proceeds. Alcoa, meanwhile, has hinted that selling assets directly to technology firms might make more economic sense than running power-hungry metal operations that no longer pencil out.

Industry leaders warn that without government action, the United States will struggle to rebuild a capability many now consider strategically important. The Aluminum Association estimates that reviving domestic smelting would require at least five large facilities, billions in capital and years of construction. Washington has already moved on tariffs, but producers argue that the deeper challenge lies in the power market, where the surge in AI-driven demand is leaving traditional industries priced out.

The result is a paradox: a country experiencing its highest aluminium demand in modern history, yet unable to supply the metal that underpins the technologies it wants to lead. As AI expands and electricity grows scarce, America’s aluminium sector finds itself fighting for relevance in the very boom that should have secured its future.",http://www.alcircle.com/api/media/1764380591.26506_AI_0_0.jpg,N,,2025-11-30 10:03:03.222413

MPLX Investment Narrative Recap

MPLX shareholders must believe in the enduring demand for U.S. energy infrastructure and the company's ability to capitalize on export growth from key regions like Houston and the Permian Basin. The recent partnership with Oneok to develop a US$1.75 billion Texas City export terminal expands MPLX’s export capacity, but does not meaningfully reduce near-term risks tied to market or regulatory headwinds that can impact return on new investments.

Among recent announcements, the 12.5% increase in MPLX’s quarterly dividend stands out. A strengthened distribution underscores management’s confidence in cash flow durability, an important point, given the sizable capital commitments like the new Houston project that will test MPLX’s ability to deliver long-term returns and sustain payout growth.

In contrast, investors should also keep a close eye on how expanding capital expenditures might magnify balance sheet and refinancing risks if...

MPLX's narrative projects $14.0 billion in revenue and $5.3 billion in earnings by 2028. This requires 6.8% yearly revenue growth and a $1.0 billion increase in earnings from the current $4.3 billion.

Recently, Targa Resources, a market leader of midstream services in the United States, outlined its plans to develop a 500-mile “Speedway” NGL pipeline that will link the Permian to Mont Belvieu, Texas. The company has been contemplating measures to increase its foothold in the Permian and now has plans to construct the astonishingly long NGL pipeline, along with several other projects.

The 500-mile Natural Gas Liquids pipeline exemplifies the company’s ambitions for the US market

Targa Resources has become one of the largest independent infrastructure companies in North America and boasts a diversified portfolio of significant domestic infrastructure assets that have positioned the United States as the world’s go-to destination for gas supply.

The reality of the impact of sanctions on Russian energy has led the US to become the top destination for the world’s gas and NGL buyers, all frantically searching for a non-Russian energy supplier. The new “cold war” of energy resources between the US and Russia has led many nations that formerly did business with Moscow to enter into purchasing agreements with the US to buy their substantial gas supply.

Targa Resources’ Speedway NGL Pipeline will become the backbone of the US gas sector

The company has noted that the plan is to construct a 30-inch pipeline and associated infrastructure with a start-up capacity of 500,000 barrels per day, which could be doubled to 1 million barrels per day if needed. The expected price tag to build the Speedway NGL Pipeline is hovering around $1.6 billion and is expected to begin service in the third quarter of 2027.

The Speedway NGL pipeline is not the only project being planned by Targa Resources

The firm has confirmed its plan to construct the Yeti processing plant, which will boast a 275 million cubic feet per day capacity that will serve the firm’s growth on the Permian Delaware system. Targa is currently constructing five gas processing plants that will come online over the next by 2027, and has outlined plans to build an additional 35-mile natural gas pipeline that will enhance the company’s connectivity to the Permian operations.

Furthermore, Targa is planning a 55-mile conversion of an existing pipeline into natural gas service, targeting the expansion of its extensive energy infrastructure to accommodate an expected increase in gas demand around the United States and the world. However, some industry analysts have cautioned that the new pipeline could result in substantial spare capacity out of the Permian Basin.

“If Targa sustains the approximate 140,000-barrel-per-day annual NGL growth it achieved during the Grand Prix-Daytona buildout, Speedway’s initial 500,000-barrel-per-day capacity could be filled within about two years after startup. Speedway provides much-needed headroom, though Targa must carefully coordinate fractionation and LPG export expansions to avoid system bottlenecks.” – Julian Renton and Jaxson Fryer of East Daley Analytics

As several energy-rich nations outline their plans to invest heavily in the midstream sector over the coming years, Targa is betting on its vast Permian infrastructure to lead the US into a new era.

,EVs,2025-11-30 00:04:57+00:00,SlashGear,"Tesla Isn't Alone, Most Electric Cars Lose Value Faster Than You Might Think - SlashGear",Charlie Berrey,,,,,https://www.slashgear.com/2036940/electric-cars-like-tesla-losing-value-faster-why/,"Electric cars are nothing new.
So, while the data suggests electric cars depreciate at a faster rate, it's important to explore other avenues to verify the claim.
This steep drop-off in value was seen clear as day recently when a 2021 Tesla Model Y Long Range sold for less than half of its original MSRP, despite being fairly well presented.
While Tesla models do not feature on the list, among the worst performers are models like the Nissan Leaf, Wrangler 4xe, Volkswagen ID.4, Subaru Solterra, and Toyota bZ4x.
There are many reasons why Tesla models might drop value quickly, from over saturation in the market to the CEO's controversial political viewpoints, but the truth is the same results can be seen across the entire EV market.","Electric cars are nothing new. Not even in the sense that, yes technically, electric vehicles have been around for over a century, but even in the mainstream automotive world, EVs have been regular sights on the road now for over a decade. The infrastructure has come on leaps and bounds: they can be charged in minutes, battery packs don't degrade as badly as the naysayers feared they would, and they are even getting more affordable to buy, too.

However, for some reason, they still depreciate far quicker than their gas-powered counterparts. EVs are fairly attractive as a new buy for many of us, but secondhand models are just not that desirable, it would seem. According to Thunder Said Energy, while ICE cars tend to depreciate on average by $0.11 per mile covered, EVs come in at $0.27 per mile, demonstrating just how wide the gulf is. There are variables that could affect the value of this data, for example, over the past few years, many EVs will have been purchased with a $7,500 reduction, courtesy of the now-canceled federal tax credits. This, effectively, immediately places $7,500 worth of depreciation onto qualifying vehicles, as surely no one would pay more for a used model.

This needs to be taken into account when looking at electric vs. gas in terms of depreciation; it's important to compare the actual price paid, and not just the MSRP listed prior to incentives. With that being said, we can't rely solely on depreciation reports, as it's unclear whether or not the effective $7,500 reduction has been factored into the calculations. So, while the data suggests electric cars depreciate at a faster rate, it's important to explore other avenues to verify the claim.

It's true that Tesla resale values aren't what they used to be. This might be down to their huge popularity; a large supply on the used market might be outpacing demand. Other factors are always at play too, such as Tesla CEO Elon Musk's political controversies, and how the brand fares in relation to new competition, such as Rivian and Lucid. This steep drop-off in value was seen clear as day recently when a 2021 Tesla Model Y Long Range sold for less than half of its original MSRP, despite being fairly well presented.

Back in 2021, the Tesla cost its owner $54,190, and came in a smart specification, with a smart Satin Dark Gray wrap, 20-inch Induction wheels, and a black leather interior. If we factor in a $7,500 reduction, courtesy of the federal tax credits, that gives us a revised purchase price of $46,690. However, this attractive spec and reasonable odometer reading of just 48,500 miles did little to excite buyers when it came up for auction, with the hammer falling at a miserable $24,888. CarEdge's depreciation calculator suggests this is quite typical of the model, suggesting that a Model Y will drop 57% of its value after four years on the road and 48,000 miles. Judging by this estimate, the auction seller actually did quite well, losing roughly 47% of the original purchase price, taking into account a likely $7,500 reduction on the MSRP when new.

In addition, CarEdge has ranked 185 cars according to how well, or how poorly, they retain value. While Tesla models do not feature on the list, among the worst performers are models like the Nissan Leaf, Wrangler 4xe, Volkswagen ID.4, Subaru Solterra, and Toyota bZ4x.

The Wrangler 4xe — one of which we test drove in 2024 — is an interesting model to highlight, as of course, there is a near-identical gas-powered model with which we can compare in terms of depreciation. Once again relying on data sourced from CarEdge, we see that the gas-powered Wrangler typically can be expected to shed 29% of its value in the first five years of ownership. This is based upon a new price of $48,226 and 13,500 miles being covered each year, and it translates to a total loss of $14,116.

By way of comparison, the Wrangler 4xe is projected to drop a staggering 59% of its value over those same years and miles. The starting price given by CarEdge is higher, at $61,887, to reflect the model's real-world higher starting price. As such, the amount lost is also considerably more, at $36,235. Even if we strip the qualified amount of EV tax credits from that figure, and factor in cheaper running and maintenance costs, the traditionally motivated Wrangler still looks to be the financially safer bet after five years on the road.

Similar comparisons can be made elsewhere, and comparing Toyota's bZ4X and RAV4 brings similar results, as does pitting Subaru's Crosstrek against the Solterra. There are many reasons why Tesla models might drop value quickly, from over saturation in the market to the CEO's controversial political viewpoints, but the truth is the same results can be seen across the entire EV market.",https://www.slashgear.com/img/gallery/tesla-isnt-alone-most-electric-cars-lose-value-faster-than-you-might-think/l-intro-1764154569.jpg,N,,2025-11-29 19:58:11.882443

The statement covered headline issues such as support for electric vehicles, changes to motoring taxation and fresh commitments on energy security and efficiency.
For many on the left, the sustainability content will likely feel underpowered, especially given the scale of the climate challenge.
""One of the greatest drivers of the rising cost of living is the cost of energy prices,"" Reeves told the Commons.
""The cause of high energy bills must be tackled at source and so we are investing in energy security in nuclear and renewable energy, and in insulation through our Warm Homes Plan.""","The UK's Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves has set out the Labour government’s second Autumn Budget since taking office in 2024, outlining how the UK intends to tax and spend in 2026 and the years that follow.

The statement covered headline issues such as support for electric vehicles, changes to motoring taxation and fresh commitments on energy security and efficiency.

The fiscal package had been trailed as a pivotal moment for Reeves and Prime Minister Keir Starmer, with the administration seeing pressure from both the Greens and Reform as discontent grows across the political spectrum.

With this backdrop, the Chancellor opted for a relatively cautious stance, keeping income tax and national insurance rates unchanged in a bid to avoid provoking either left or right.

“I’ve made my choices: not reckless borrowing, not dangerous cuts, but stability for our economy, security for our public finances and security for family finances too,” she said. “Those are the Labour choices.”

Overall, the Budget contained fewer big-ticket spending pledges than some recent predecessors, though there were notable signals on how the UK will support renewable power, EV charging and energy-efficiency schemes over the next five years.

For many on the left, the sustainability content will likely feel underpowered, especially given the scale of the climate challenge. Reeves also used her speech to caution against what she characterised as overreach in pursuit of net-zero, taking aim at the Green Party in the process.

“The leader of the Green Party is a keen hypnotherapist and he believes he can achieve remarkable things using only the power of his mind,” Reeves said.

“Unfortunately, the only things getting bigger under his approach would be the deficit and the rate of inflation.”

A new pay-per-mile tax for EV drivers

One of the most eye-catching measures for the energy and transport sectors is a new mileage-based levy on battery electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles, designed to narrow the gap with traditional internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs).

Under the plans, the Electric Vehicle Excise Duty will charge EV owners per mile driven, rather than relying solely on conventional vehicle excise duty bands.

""Because all cars contribute to the wear and tear on our roads,” she said, “I will ensure that drivers are taxed according to how much they drive and not just by the type of car they own by introducing the EV Excise Duty on electric cars.”

The charge is expected to be set at around £0.03 per mile for fully electric models and £0.015 per mile for plug-in hybrids, starting in April 2028 and projected to generate about US$1.8bn by the 2029-2030 fiscal year.

The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) has indicated that this will offset roughly a quarter of the 0.6% of GDP that would otherwise be lost from declining fuel duty receipts as the fleet electrifies.

While still only around half of the effective rate faced by petrol and diesel drivers, the move has already prompted debate over its impact on the EV transition.

“Today’s announcement is a clear signal that the UK is serious about an all-electric future,” says Mark Caskey, MD of Projects at Mitie.

“However, introducing a pay-per-mile charge for EVs, on top of existing road taxes, sends a mixed message. Businesses need certainty to invest in cleaner fleets, not policies that could stall momentum and threaten jobs in UK manufacturing.”

Britain's nuclear future

On the power system, the Budget confirms temporary funding for the renewables obligation mechanism, with spending of US$3.8bn pencilled in for the coming year and an average outlay of US$2.6bn in both 2027-28 and 2028-29.

This support is due to be wound down and removed entirely by 2029-30, signalling an eventual transition away from this particular subsidy regime.

""One of the greatest drivers of the rising cost of living is the cost of energy prices,"" Reeves told the Commons.

""The cause of high energy bills must be tackled at source and so we are investing in energy security in nuclear and renewable energy, and in insulation through our Warm Homes Plan.""

As part of this, Reeves highlighted plans to team up with Rolls-Royce to build three small modular reactors in Wales at the Wylfa site, a move intended to anchor a new generation of nuclear capacity in the UK.

The Warm Homes Plan will channel funding towards lower-income households, helping them upgrade insulation and low-carbon heating, including through an expanded Boiler Upgrade Scheme and streamlined planning rules for heat pump installations.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/b58015f2c9a8b69086119c3e93ff0dad:acbb713b6edbadb634167b08996a56b7/rachel-reeves-the-uk-s-chancellor-of-the-exchequer-today-revealed-the-government-s-budget.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-11-29 23:59:08.113830

There must have been some mistake. A wrecking crew showed up almost without notice, rumbling in the direction of the East Wing. I hope no one was inside when, unannounced, the crane stood astride the structure and embarked on its demolition directive.

It must have come as a surprise, even to the White House staff, since President Trump had assured everyone that the East Wing would be spared in his plan for the 90,000-square-foot ballroom he envisioned.

As with so many other assurances from him, Trump ignored his promise, and authorized the complete destruction of the east facade of the People’s House. The garish, gold-plated

monument that will replace the east entryway often used by guests and access to the headquarters of our first ladies aligns perfectly with the tasteless, gold-festooned Oval Office, reminiscent of tsarist vulgarity.

What the construction blueprint ought to have envisioned was an urgently needed upgrade to the septic system that serves the presidential suite. Remember the time the current occupant touted his agenda to “drain the swamp.” Instead, he has created a cesspool of corruption that dwarfs the misdeeds of any prior occupant.

The public reaction to the odor demands a thorough sanitizing to rid the residence of the stench.

Here is what a filter of the detritus would encounter:

Acceptance of a $400 million (before retrofitting) jetliner from a foreign government that will land at the Trump library, such as it will be.

A pardon for the world’s best known and wealthiest crypto felon, whose business

dealings with the Trump boys will surely flourish.

A crypto business deal with the UAE worth $2 billion, which will benefit the boys,

the son-in-law and the pal, Steve Witkoff.

This doesn’t even account for the coins, Bibles, guitars, boots and, yes, even the Constitution, merch that could clog any heavy-duty filter.

All of this can be cataloged as unprecedented greed by an American president. It mirrors the behavior of Trump’s role model, Vladimir Putin: using power to line the pockets of family and oligarchs, in return for unconditional loyalty.

If this denigration of the office of president were the only waste to be encountered by a

White House septic system, it would overwhelm it. But, there is so much more.

Let’s recall Trump’s 2023 Rose Garden promise to be “the most transparent president ever.” The utter hypocrisy of that assurance is evident in his refusal to release visitor logs and tax returns (are they still under audit?), his restricting media access to those friendly to his administration and perhaps most tellingly, to his pressuring anyone he can not to release the Epstein files.

Why would he not support transparency, unless there was something to hide? Those emails released by the House Oversight Committee confirm, at the very least, a close relationship between these men, which, given Epstein’s nefarious activities, carries its own odor. The stench is so palpable that even MAGA supporters want to know the source.

That we are even seeking to determine if our president was aware of the sex trafficking operation of a person with whom he spent considerable time so demeans our country that it will take a long time to recover. To witness the complicity of Republican lawmakers attempting to suppress the information concealed in FBI and DOJ files only adds to the sordid story unfolding before our eyes.

As some defectors for whom the White House conduct is too revolting come out of their closet, we can only hope that some measure of accountability will result. It’s a long shot if we think about how successful Trump has been in intimidating his party’s senators.

And, even if they were to display uncommon bravery and vote to release the Epstein files, rest assured a veto awaits, relying, in all likelihood, on the claim that an ongoing investigation (which Trump initiated against Democratic notables using his law firm, the DOJ) prevents the release.

The sleaze is unending.

However, due to a multitude of challenges standing in the way of a complete overhaul, U.S. energy infrastructure remains highly unprepared for severe weather events.
Now, another threat is adding to fears of winter blackouts – data centres.
During a severe winter storm, Texas’ power demand could rise to as much as 85.3 GW.
This demonstrates just how dramatically the tech sector is changing the landscape of power demand through data centre development.","The energy infrastructure in the United States has failed repeatedly in instances of severe weather, due to years of underinvestment and the failure of utilities to work together to strengthen larger networks. During winter storms and wildfires, a wide range of energy infrastructure has been known to fail due to the lack of preparedness by utilities and state governments. Going into the winter months, there are fears over more potential network failures across various parts of the U.S.

Texas, California, and several other states face annual power outages due to severe weather events, from winter storms to heatwaves. In February 2021, Storm Uri brought plunging temperatures to the state of Texas and left millions of people without electricity, heat, or running water, as much of the infrastructure froze. These outages turned off electricity in various parts of Texas, including parts of the natural gas network that are electrically operated, such as pumps and antifreeze injection systems. This led to the shutdown of several power plants.

During the storm, as demand increased for heating, Texas grid operator ERCOT ordered 20 GW of rolling blackouts to prevent a total system collapse, according to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). It was the “largest manually controlled load shedding event in U.S. history,” with 4.5 million people losing power for several days, stated a FERC report.

The U.S. energy network is highly fragmented, with different state governments each managing parts of the grid, and a multitude of utilities responsible for different infrastructure. The fractured nature of the system makes it extremely hard to fix. For example, investment made in the transmission lines of one state may not be replicated by the neighbouring state, meaning that the network in part of a region may be more resilient than another.

In 2021, the Biden administration introduced the $2 trillion Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, aimed at upgrading U.S. infrastructure. The plan earmarked $100 billion in financing to update and modernise the electric grid to make it more reliable and resilient. However, due to a multitude of challenges standing in the way of a complete overhaul, U.S. energy infrastructure remains highly unprepared for severe weather events.

Now, another threat is adding to fears of winter blackouts – data centres. There has been a rapid rollout of data centres across the U.S. in recent years, as tech companies invest heavily in the infrastructure needed to power advanced technologies, such as artificial intelligence. This has driven up energy demand in several states, particularly in Texas. The concern now is that this will increase the risk of energy shortages, which could result in power cuts during freezing temperatures.

Requests for new data centres are on the rise in Texas, thanks to its growing renewable energy capacity and natural gas resources. In recent years, Houston has become known by many as the Silicon Valley of energy, for its strong reputation for energy production, growing cleantech sector, and welcoming business environment. This has helped attract significant investment to the state from tech companies looking to expand operations.

The North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) warned in November that the 24/7 energy demand of data centres will make it increasingly difficult to maintain sufficient electricity supply during times of high demand, such as if the temperature drops to an extreme low.

During a severe winter storm, Texas’ power demand could rise to as much as 85.3 GW. While the state’s 92.6 GW electricity capacity would normally be enough to power this demand, the available power could decrease to roughly 69.7 GW during a severe weather event, meaning a deficit of over 15 GW.

In a recent analysis, NERC stated, “Strong load growth from new data centres and other large industrial end users is driving higher winter electricity demand forecasts and contributing to continued risk of supply shortfalls.” It went on to say that while Texas will experience elevated risk during extreme winter weather, but the grid will remain stable during normal peak demand.

Over 120 GW of projects have requested to be connected to the Texas grid, marking a 170 percent increase since January requests. Approximately 73 percent of these projects are data centres, according to ERCOT. If all these data centres are built, it would equate to the average annual power consumption of almost 154 million homes. However, experts believe that it is unlikely for the massive project pipeline to be developed in its entirety, as there is simply not enough power to serve it.

Years of underinvestment in the U.S. grid, a lack of preparedness from utilities, and the rise in demand for data centres could lead to a power deficit if Texas, or another state, is hit by severe weather this winter. This demonstrates just how dramatically the tech sector is changing the landscape of power demand through data centre development. It also implies the need for stronger regulations to ensure that the electricity supply is sufficient and stable enough to meet demand before approving new projects.

But a new analysis from the Pew Research Center shows that behind the innovation is a massive, and growing, strain on the country’s energy and water systems. And for everyday Americans, that could mean higher bills and new long-term environmental challenges.

AI’s Power Appetite Is Exploding

Pew’s review of federal and international data shows U.S. data centers used 183 terawatt-hours of electricity in 2024, about 4% of all electricity used nationwide, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). That’s roughly equal to the entire annual electricity use of Pakistan.

The biggest driver? Hyperscale facilities built specifically for AI models.

According to Pew and the IEA, a typical AI-optimized hyperscale center uses as much electricity as 100,000 homes a year. Newer mega-facilities could use 20 times more once they go online.

In major hubs, especially Northern Virginia, clusters of these centers now consume more than a quarter of the state’s total electricity supply, the Electric Power Research Institute reports.

The Ripple Effect: Rising Bills and Stressed Grids

The higher the power demand, the more utilities must upgrade the grid, and those costs don’t disappear.

In the PJM electricity market (Illinois to North Carolina), data center growth added $9.3 billion in capacity costs for 2025–26, per Pew’s analysis of PJM data. The result:

+ $18/month in western Maryland

+ $16/month in Ohio homes

Looking ahead, Carnegie Mellon University estimates U.S. electricity bills could rise 8% by 2030 just from data centers and crypto mining alone, with even steeper hikes in the most data-center-dense regions.

Water Use: The Quiet Problem No One Is Ready For

Electricity isn’t the only resource being pushed to the limit.

Pew cites federal figures showing U.S. data centers used 17 billion gallons of water in 2023, mostly to cool energy-intensive AI chips at hyperscale sites. And by 2028, hyperscale centers alone could be consuming 16 to 33 billion gallons annually — roughly the yearly use of a mid-sized U.S. city. Cooling demands vary by season and by facility design, but researchers say the overall trend is clear: AI growth means water demand is climbing fast.

Americans Are Unsure What to Make of AI’s Environmental Impact

Pew’s August 2024 survey suggests the public hasn’t formed a consensus:

25% believe AI will harm the environment

20% believe it will help

25% think it’ll be a mix

30% aren’t sure

Yet in recent months, we’ve watched two long-standing local restaurants — The Lawrenceville Drive-In, a fixture in our community for decades, and Hardee’s — close their doors. These losses should be a wake-up call for all of us.

The truth is simple: when we choose to shop or eat across the river instead of right here at home, our local businesses struggle to survive. Dollars spent in Vincennes support their economy, their workers, and their tax base — not ours. Meanwhile, our own businesses, owned and staffed by our neighbors, face an uphill battle just to keep the doors open. If more of our daily spending had stayed local, it’s entirely possible these two restaurants could still be open today.

Supporting local businesses isn’t just sentimental — it’s smart economic strategy. Money spent in Lawrenceville circulates within Lawrenceville. It helps pay local employees, fund local services, and build the foundation needed to attract new businesses and restaurants. When potential investors see a community that actively supports its businesses, they’re more likely to bring new opportunities here.

But the business climate isn’t only shaped by shopping habits. Serious environmental violations — like the ones recently committed by our wastewater treatment plant — also have a direct impact on economic growth. Companies considering Lawrenceville look closely at infrastructure, regulatory compliance, and environmental safety. When our WWTP exceeds permitted discharge limits and risks polluting our river, it doesn’t just harm wildlife — it signals to prospective businesses that our city may not be prepared to support long-term, sustainable development. No business wants to invest in a community facing ongoing environmental compliance issues.

City leadership must take this seriously. Along with simplifying processes and improving communication, we need consistent accountability and transparent operation of essential services. A healthy business environment starts with responsible management of the city’s core infrastructure.

A thriving local economy doesn’t happen by accident. It happens when a community decides that supporting its own — and maintaining the standards that attract new investment — is a priority. Lawrenceville deserves that level of commitment from its leaders and its citizens.

City Council meetings are held on the second Thursday of each month at 7 p.m. at Lawrenceville City Hall, and I encourage every resident to attend and stay engaged.

It’s the kind of whiplash I keep hearing about from tribal energy leaders across Indian Country.

“If they understand sovereignty and history, they’ll be more comfortable bringing capital into Indian Country,” Clini said.
Where federal funding has failed, the plan for those working in Indian Country energy is to step in and knit together what projects they can, however they can.","Cody Two-Bears spent more than $1 million training Native workers for clean energy jobs. Then the jobs disappeared.

The federal Solar for All program that funded his nonprofit, Indigenized Energy, was terminated in August as part of the Trump administration’s broader pullback from renewable energy. Indigenized Energy won’t be reimbursed. The workers he trained are now looking for positions that no longer exist.

It’s the kind of whiplash I keep hearing about from tribal energy leaders across Indian Country. Federal funding for tribal energy surged under the Biden administration, then vanished under the Trump administration — and tribes that built plans around that money are scrambling to find alternatives.

The scale of what’s been cut is staggering. The Environmental Protection Agency has frozen or outright terminated the $27 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund in its entirety, $2 billion of which was aimed squarely at Indian Country. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act laid out a quick sunsetting of game-changing tax credits that will now prove difficult for many tribes to access. In October, the Department of Energy terminated $8 billion in energy projects across the country, including multiple projects tied directly to or closely benefitting tribal nations.

Native energy advocates worried what that policy shift might mean, but expressed optimism that the most important pieces of Biden-era policy would remain in place. They didn’t. As a Republican-led Congress signed onto Trump’s policies mostly wholesale, funding evaporated even faster than expected, kneecapping clean energy’s momentum.

In my reporting, I’ve heard a lot of tribal energy experts say basically the same thing: If Washington won't fund it, Indian Country will find another way.

“The Big Beautiful Bill really took the wind out of our sails in terms of rewriting the energy narrative,” Clara Pratte, executive director and co-founder of energy developer Navajo Power, said during a recent webinar hosted by Clean Energy for America. “Now, as practitioners, one of the things we’re beholden to is figuring out where we find that capital, where we continue the good work.”

Pratte’s answer was specific: “We’re looking at private capital, philanthropy and tribal-to-tribal partnerships,” she said. “If federal dollars aren’t reliable, then we have to make sure our projects are bankable in other ways. That’s how we keep moving.”

Claudio Clini, a policy analyst with energy advocacy nonprofit Alliance for Tribal Clean Energy, said his organization planned to “demystify” Indian Country for potential investors, working to clarify sovereignty and land law, and to close culture gaps.

“If they understand sovereignty and history, they’ll be more comfortable bringing capital into Indian Country,” Clini said.

In the meantime, Two-Bears said, tribes should plan to turn toward banks and private financing to keep projects afloat where nonprofit or foundational dollars can’t quite reach.

“Tribes need to demonstrate that we can build projects that can be repaid. We’ve got to make these attractive to banks and other people that loan the money,” Two-Bears said. “We have to show that we can take those loans and pay those loans back, then keep these projects alive.”

It's a familiar pattern. In my reporting on tribal broadband and workforce development, I've seen tribes building internal capacity specifically to reduce dependence on federal dollars — control what you can, because Washington's priorities change every election.

Where federal funding has failed, the plan for those working in Indian Country energy is to step in and knit together what projects they can, however they can.

The team of volunteers are a full house for the chamber of commerce.” Chamber dinners are about celebrating successes and recognizing individuals and organizations for the work they do in the community.
“Former Wellsburg chamber President Dan Otto even passed along a new set of scissors to commemorate our first ribbon-cutting as a chamber of commerce,” he said.
Emily Byers, president of the Jefferson County Chamber of Commerce, and Brenda Mull, president of the Weirton Area Chamber of Commerce, both were at the dinner.
“You should be proud of your chamber of commerce,” Fithyan added.","Running a chamber of commerce is never an easy assignment, and it can get even more complicated when the organization has been built through the merger of two longtime groups.

When you consider the accomplishments of the Brooke County Area Chamber of Commerce, however, you have to say that the organization has gotten off to a pretty good start.

“This evening, we are all seated at the same table — a table of opportunity connection and growth,” said Sandy Kemp. “It’s wonderful to see so many familiar faces, and so many new ones at our table tonight.”

Kemp, the director of the Brooke County Senior Center, was speaking as the first vice president of the Brooke chamber, and her words were delivered Nov. 12 as part of the opening remarks at the organization’s recognition dinner. She stressed that the chamber’s core was strengthening business connections and bringing people together.

“This past year, the merger of the Wellsburg and Follansbee chambers has been a winning combination,” Kemp said to the 200-or-so who attended the dinner at the St. Francis Center in Follansbee.

Her words were in keeping with the theme of the evening: Place Your Bets on Success: Bet on the Chamber. They also helped to guide President Eric Fithyan.

“Tonight, we celebrate our first year as a merged chamber,” Fithyan explained. “I think it’s safe to say that we’ve hit the jackpot. The team of volunteers are a full house for the chamber of commerce.”

Chamber dinners are about celebrating successes and recognizing individuals and organizations for the work they do in the community. This year’s honorees — A Child’s Place C.A.S.A., the nonprofit organization of the year; Suzanne Davidson, the recipient of the lifetime achievement award; Tony Viola, the young professional of the year; Two Antique Geeks, the business of the year; and Samantha Walters, the citizen of the year — certainly fell into that category.

But, as Fihyan said, the biggest milestone of the year was the merger of the Wellsburg and Follansbee chambers that created the new group.

“What started as months of conversations between two organizations become a reality this year,” he said. “Both groups placed trust in me to serve as president for two years to help guide the transition into a unified chamber of commerce.”

That transition did not come without challenges.

“As with many changes, some members of our board of directors retired, and others decided that the decision was not for them,” Fithyan added. “But those who stayed came together with dedication and a vision, joined by many members. We came together to create something stronger, something better — a vibrant, united organization.”

Fithyan said a rotating board structure will hope to ensure that the organization always has fresh board members who will bring new perspectives and fresh ideas.

While the organization is moving forward, Fithyan said, it’s important that it does not lose touch with the past.

“Former Wellsburg chamber President Dan Otto even passed along a new set of scissors to commemorate our first ribbon-cutting as a chamber of commerce,” he said.

Those scissors have handles that are orange and blue.

“Our colors tell our story — the orange represents Wellsburg High School and the Orange Knights, and the blue is for the Follansbee Blue Wave. We’re deep in history, but we’re still one chamber of commerce,” Fithyan said.

“They represent who we are now, a new organization built on rich traditions as we share one motto of working together.”

Fithyan added that the chamber ribbon-cuttings during the past year had welcomed six new businesses to the area.

Collaboration, he explained, is important to everything the chamber does. That includes partnering with the other chambers of commerce in our region. Emily Byers, president of the Jefferson County Chamber of Commerce, and Brenda Mull, president of the Weirton Area Chamber of Commerce, both were at the dinner.

It also includes working with volunteers at community events, from helping at the Mountaineer Food Bank and the Wellsburg Applefest to providing teacher grants and coordinating one of the region’s biggest trunk-or-treat events. Those efforts helped the organization earn a nomination as a finalist in the community involvement category in the Best of the Best awards presented by the Herald-Star and The Weirton Daily Times.

“That’s recognition that reflects every hour of volunteer time and every ounce of dedication to this team,” Fithyan said.

Volunteer work, he explained, is what makes the chamber a success.

“All of this, every event, every partnership, every success was accomplished by an all-volunteer team,” Fithyan added.

That dedication and work have created a solid foundation for the organization.

“You should be proud of your chamber of commerce,” Fithyan added. “You should be proud of your volunteer effort. As your president, I am proud, deeply proud, to serve and to serve Brooke County and our surrounding communities. From Weirton to Beech Bottom, from Bethany to Colliers to Wellsburg and Follansbee, we are a family.”

But a new analysis from the Pew Research Center shows that behind the innovation is a massive, and growing, strain on the country’s energy and water systems. And for everyday Americans, that could mean higher bills and new long-term environmental challenges.

AI’s Power Appetite Is Exploding

Pew’s review of federal and international data shows U.S. data centers used 183 terawatt-hours of electricity in 2024, about 4% of all electricity used nationwide, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). That’s roughly equal to the entire annual electricity use of Pakistan.

The biggest driver? Hyperscale facilities built specifically for AI models.

According to Pew and the IEA, a typical AI-optimized hyperscale center uses as much electricity as 100,000 homes a year. Newer mega-facilities could use 20 times more once they go online.

In major hubs, especially Northern Virginia, clusters of these centers now consume more than a quarter of the state’s total electricity supply, the Electric Power Research Institute reports.

The Ripple Effect: Rising Bills and Stressed Grids

The higher the power demand, the more utilities must upgrade the grid, and those costs don’t disappear.

In the PJM electricity market (Illinois to North Carolina), data center growth added $9.3 billion in capacity costs for 2025–26, per Pew’s analysis of PJM data. The result:

+ $18/month in western Maryland

+ $16/month in Ohio homes

Looking ahead, Carnegie Mellon University estimates U.S. electricity bills could rise 8% by 2030 just from data centers and crypto mining alone, with even steeper hikes in the most data-center-dense regions.

Water Use: The Quiet Problem No One Is Ready For

Electricity isn’t the only resource being pushed to the limit.

Pew cites federal figures showing U.S. data centers used 17 billion gallons of water in 2023, mostly to cool energy-intensive AI chips at hyperscale sites. And by 2028, hyperscale centers alone could be consuming 16 to 33 billion gallons annually — roughly the yearly use of a mid-sized U.S. city. Cooling demands vary by season and by facility design, but researchers say the overall trend is clear: AI growth means water demand is climbing fast.

Americans Are Unsure What to Make of AI’s Environmental Impact

Pew’s August 2024 survey suggests the public hasn’t formed a consensus:

25% believe AI will harm the environment

20% believe it will help

25% think it’ll be a mix

30% aren’t sure

That uncertainty mirrors the reality: the U.S. is witnessing a resource-intensive surge with no clear long-term blueprint yet.",https://abc45.com/resources/media2/16x9/5025/1320/0x292/90/5dc7c502-fcd0-4b76-abf7-f9abfcb15a73-GettyImages2242297318.jpg,N,,2025-11-29 14:08:40.286860

The EU’s Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD) and the German Supply Chain Act already require companies to prove human rights and environmental safeguards.
The International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB) is developing global assurance standards for ESG disclosures, while buyers of automotive and electronics are demanding supplier-level carbon verification.
Yet SMEs remain critical links in global supply chains.
Companies that embed traceability, carbon accountability, and third-party assurance today won’t just meet tightening rules.","Global supply chains are facing the most profound audit transformation in decades. What began as siloed compliance programs for safety, quality, or sustainability is rapidly converging into integrated, data-driven assurance. By 2026, suppliers will be audited not just on product quality, but on their carbon footprint, human rights practices, and ability to prove end-to-end traceability.

1. Regulation moves from paper to penalties

Across regions, disclosure and due diligence rules are shifting from voluntary to enforceable. The EU’s Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD) and the German Supply Chain Act already require companies to prove human rights and environmental safeguards. In the U.S., the SEC’s climate disclosure rules and the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA) are raising the bar on transparency. Non-compliance no longer means reputational damage alone — it now carries financial, legal, and market access risks.

2. Traceability-by-design is becoming the new standard

According to McKinsey, 70% of a company’s emissions come from suppliers, most of which remain opaque. To meet Scope 3 reporting requirements, batch-level, machine-readable data will soon be non-negotiable. Blockchain pilots in apparel are already proving the feasibility of immutable chain-of-custody records.

3. Assurance extends beyond ESG reporting

Just as financial statements require independent auditors, sustainability data is moving toward third-party verification. The International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB) is developing global assurance standards for ESG disclosures, while buyers of automotive and electronics are demanding supplier-level carbon verification.

4. Technology raises — but doesn’t replace — human judgment

AI and automation will play a pivotal role:

AI-powered analytics can detect anomalies in labor hours or energy use before audits take place.

Automated compliance checks will free auditors to focus on remediation and long-term risk.

Yet cultural dynamics, ethical dilemmas, and stakeholder trust still demand human interpretation.

5. The expanding scope: From EHS to climate, human rights and biodiversity

Traditional environmental, health, and safety (EHS) audits are broadening into multi-criteria assessments. Future audits will verify not only emissions but also water usage, biodiversity impacts, and living-wage compliance. The World Benchmarking Alliance reports that fewer than 20% of major companies can currently demonstrate full supply-chain due diligence, a gap buyers and regulators are determined to close.

What does this mean for suppliers?

Adapting to these rising expectations will not be uniform across the supply chain. Large corporations generally have the resources to invest in real-time data systems, cross-functional compliance structures, and external assurance providers. For small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), however, the path is far more complex. Fragmented regulatory requirements, limited budgets, and slower technology adoption often create barriers to meeting the new audit standards.

Yet SMEs remain critical links in global supply chains. To avoid being left behind, many will need to rely on collaborative solutions rather than individual investments. Industry-wide digital platforms, pooled audit programs, training partnerships, and shared capacity-building initiatives are emerging as viable models. These mechanisms not only lower costs but also provide smaller suppliers with a way to align with the rising demands around ESG, carbon, traceability, safety, and quality—all converging in a single audit framework.

4 moves to stay ahead

Data governance: Establish auditable “sources of truth” for emissions, labor hours, and material origins.

Digital traceability: Capture batch/lot and chain-of-custody data aligned with EU Digital Product Passport and FDA’s FSMA.

Risk-based due diligence: Follow OECD’s six-step model and ensure grievance mechanisms are in place.

AI-ready documentation: Keep master data structured to enable AI-driven compliance reviews.

The takeaway

Audits are no longer box-checking exercises — they are becoming the currency of trust in global trade. Companies that embed traceability, carbon accountability, and third-party assurance today won’t just meet tightening rules. They will earn a competitive edge in a marketplace where resilience, transparency, and low-carbon performance define the winners of tomorrow.",https://img.sdcexec.com/mindful/acbm/workspaces/default/uploads/2025/10/parinapril-adobestock-1651133848.MDG0WGNbxO.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&q=70&w=1200,N,,2025-11-29 15:00:15.768344

Across the industry, operators in 2026 face pressure to meet stricter carbon standards and seize rebates that reward innovative retrofits.

The focus now shifts from sweeping remodels to practical fixes, like tuning cooklines, upgrading ventilation, and rethinking gas versus electric tools that promise measurable savings and faster service. Here's an overview of how to make the most of these opportunities.

Reassessing the Hidden Drivers of Kitchen Energy Waste

Much of a kitchen's energy loss comes from small inefficiencies that stack up daily. Gas burners left idling, clogged hood filters, and poor heat recovery waste both fuel and money. It's like leaving a faucet running all night, except the leak is invisible and constant.

Chefs often underestimate standby loads from prep equipment, or how uneven refrigeration seals drive compressors to run nonstop. Data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration shows restaurants can use up to 4 times more energy than a typical commercial building, so finding efficiency savings must be a priority in this industry.

Thermal imaging and smart meters now reveal where heat escapes or airflow stagnates. So instead of replacing everything, operators can start by auditing usage, tightening maintenance routines, and retraining staff. The biggest savings usually come not from new appliances, but from sharper control over the ones already in use.

Comparing Gas, Electric, and Hybrid Cooking Systems

Choosing between gas, electric, or hybrid systems now involves more than flavor or tradition. Energy pricing shifts and carbon disclosure rules are reshaping that choice.

Gas still offers instant control, but it vents more heat into the room, forcing hoods and HVAC systems to work harder. Electric induction units, on the other hand, send most of their energy directly into cookware, keeping kitchens cooler and cleaner. Hybrid lines blend both, letting operators match energy type to menu volume and cost.

In practice, a busy grill station might stay gas-fired to maintain peak throughput, while prep or saute areas switch to induction. It's like swapping muscle power for assisted gears on a bike, making things smoother and faster without losing control.

Upgrading Broilers and Ovens for Speed and Efficiency

Broilers and ovens are the heart of any cookline, yet they also rank among the hungriest energy users. Modern models use sensors, reflective panels, and insulated cavities to keep more heat on the food and less in the air. Conveyor and infrared broilers, for instance, deliver steady searing while cutting preheat and recovery times.

Before investing, you can compare different commercial broilers to gauge how throughput, fuel type, and vent requirements affect operating costs. Some new units reclaim exhaust heat to warm incoming air or preheat water, reducing total gas or electric demand.

Restaurants that upgrade older broilers often see payback within two years, especially when combined with utility rebates. The real gain goes beyond savings, though. Faster recovery means shorter ticket times and consistent quality, a quiet advantage that customers notice even if they never see the kitchen.

Smarter Ventilation for Cooler, Cheaper Kitchens

Ventilation often hides as a silent energy drain. Oversized hoods and unbalanced airflow can waste thousands each year by exhausting conditioned air faster than needed. A simple fix, like installing variable-speed fans or demand-controlled sensors, lets airflow adjust automatically with cooking load. When sensors detect idle equipment, fans slow, lights dim, and energy drops without staff effort.

Regular cleaning also matters. Grease buildup restricts flow and makes fans run harder, just as a clogged filter chokes an engine. Some kitchens now link hood monitoring to digital dashboards, allowing them to spot airflow issues before they escalate. So, smarter ventilation doesn't just lower bills. It keeps kitchens cooler, safer, and quieter, creating a more comfortable space where chefs can focus on food rather than heat.

Utility Rebates and Decarbonization Rules That Actually Pay Off

Utility incentives and carbon reduction rules now shape how restaurants plan upgrades. Many states tie rebates to verifiable energy savings, allowing operators to recover part of the cost of efficient cookers, hoods, or refrigeration. It's like trading in an old car for one that uses half the fuel, and getting paid for the switch.

Programs from utilities such as SoCalGas and Con Edison now cover audits, equipment rebates, and even kitchen staff training. The savings stack up quickly when combined with federal tax credits for electrification.

Tracking compliance is simpler, too. Smart meters and data logs supply the proof needed to qualify for funds. So, what once felt like bureaucratic red tape now becomes a profit tool. Those who act early lock in rebates before annual budgets close, turning environmental compliance into a measurable business advantage.

The Bottom Line

Cutting kitchen energy use no longer demands massive overhauls. It starts with smarter choices and daily awareness.

When restaurants treat efficiency as part of service, not just savings, every watt and calorie counts. The payoff arrives in quieter kitchens, steadier costs, and food that still tastes just as good.

America must lead on safety. - The Hill,"Kelly Wanser, opinion contributor, Kelly Wanser, opinion contributor",,,,,https://thehill.com/opinion/energy-environment/5622203-us-lags-weather-modification/,"Here’s what should worry us: America is falling behind in the one area where we should lead — the science and data needed to ensure atmospheric safety and security.
Yet today, we lack the basic information infrastructure needed to evaluate or respond to atmospheric interventions to ensure public safety.
The path forward requires sustaining globally unique U.S. federal atmospheric science programs and rapidly expanding our knowledge base — not building deployment capabilities.
We cannot prevent everyone, everywhere from developing atmospheric interventions.
The atmosphere is emerging as a domain of strategic competition with profound implications for national security, economic competitiveness and public safety.","I understand why millions of Americans look up at the sky with concern. Videos of unusual cloud formations circulate on social media, accompanied by questions about “chemtrails” and secret weather modification programs.

While concerns often reflect misunderstandings about ordinary aircraft contrails and natural atmospheric phenomena, the underlying instinct — that something may be happening in our atmosphere that we don’t know enough about — is not exactly wrong.

Weather and climate modification are not conspiracy theories. They are real, expanding capabilities that demand public attention and government action.

The question is whether the United States will lead in ensuring they emerge in the world safely and transparently or whether we will cede this emerging strategic domain to private interests and foreign competitors.

Consider what we know: China operates the world’s most extensive weather modification program, involving around 35,000 personnel, with 20 percent growth in activity from 2024 to 2025.

President Xi declared that China would build a “weather superpower,” and his meteorological director stated, “weather modification technology is an important part of building a weather superpower.”

Other nations including the United Kingdom, Australia, United Arab Emirates and Japan have launched large research and development programs.

Last month, Stardust Solutions — a private company proposing to disperse particles in the stratosphere to influence global climate — secured $60 million in venture capital, the largest funding round ever for an atmospheric intervention company.

A few weeks prior, the New York Times featured a nonprofit proposal to fast-track dispersing particles into the stratosphere.

Private organizations face structural pressures that conflict with objective safety evaluation. Companies must advance their proprietary approach and move quickly to generate returns. Nonprofits advocating for specific interventions face pressures to advance the approaches they have championed and been funded to pursue.

Truly independent assessment must be conducted drawing on strong science by public institutions free from the incentives and pressures affecting both commercial ventures and advocacy nonprofits.

Here’s what should worry us: America is falling behind in the one area where we should lead — the science and data needed to ensure atmospheric safety and security.

The United States historically excelled at atmospheric observation and rigorous, independent scientific assessment. The U.S.-led Montreal Protocol’s success in protecting the ozone layer demonstrated the power of robust research and science-based decision-making.

Yet today, we lack the basic information infrastructure needed to evaluate or respond to atmospheric interventions to ensure public safety.

We are not adequately monitoring the atmosphere. Despite efforts by the U.S. government to provide a baseline of the stratosphere — the very region companies like Stardust target — right now we lack adequate aerial sampling measurements of its chemistry. American satellite instruments dedicated to observing the stratosphere remotely are projected to discontinue service soon, leaving us increasingly blind to a domain of growing strategic importance.

We cannot sufficiently project atmospheric effects of weather and climate interventions. Current models cannot predict the impact on weather patterns, precipitation, agriculture and ecosystems with the precision required for decision-making.

We have not developed protections to ensure safety. Without adequate observations and research, we lack the monitoring capabilities and regulatory frameworks to protect against risks to the ozone layer, changes in weather patterns and other potential side-effects and to compare them to a future Earth system without intervention.

This knowledge deficit has profound national security implications. A state with large-scale weather control capabilities could gain leverage in geopolitical conflicts, manipulate precipitation patterns affecting food, water, economic activity, communications and human health or conduct interventions that harm U.S. interests without clear attribution.

The path forward requires sustaining globally unique U.S. federal atmospheric science programs and rapidly expanding our knowledge base — not building deployment capabilities.

This means public investment in sustained atmospheric observations, improved models and analytical tools, comprehensive evaluation of intervention approaches and independent scientific assessment mechanisms.

To those concerned about secret programs: The transparency and public oversight enabled by research are precisely what we need more of, not less.

The real danger comes not from government and academic scientists conducting open research (such as atmospheric programs at NASA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency), but from private and foreign actors operating without transparency, public input or monitoring.

We cannot prevent everyone, everywhere from developing atmospheric interventions. But we can ensure the United States leads in building the knowledge base for safety and security. This requires reversing divestment trends, expanding funding for atmospheric observation infrastructure, modeling and science, and developing evidence-based regulatory frameworks.

The atmosphere is emerging as a domain of strategic competition with profound implications for national security, economic competitiveness and public safety. Public concerns about what’s happening in our atmosphere are valid.

Let’s channel them into action with the right investments in science and transparency to ensure atmospheric safety and security now, or risk losing control of the skies that shape our future.

New Jersey has the goal of 100 percent clean electricity by 2035, meaning all electricity sold in the state must come from “clean” sources under its strengthened Clean Energy Standard.
This is accompanied by targets like 11 GW of offshore wind by 2040 and 2 GW of energy storage by 2030.
According to tracking by Media Matters, Murdoch-owned outlets laid the groundwork as early as August by blaming New Jersey’s higher electricity bills on green mandates and plant closures.
Murdoch-owned outlets repeatedly blamed clean energy for higher electricity prices to undercut the Inflation Reduction Act both before and after its passage in 2022, she said.","Media companies owned by Rupert Murdoch have found a “scapegoat” in clean energy for the rising electricity prices in New Jersey, according to two reports from watchdog Media Matters.

The group flagged op-eds and coverage from Fox News, The Wall Street Journal and the New York Post from August to October this year as wrongfully “blaming high electricity bills in New Jersey” on “green-energy mandates.”

“Even though the issue is most pronounced in New Jersey, it is going to be happening probably all over the country. So, any coverage that is happening there will impact the coverage of the issue everywhere,” wrote Ilana Berger, author of the two reports and a senior researcher on the Media Matters’ team on climate and energy disinformation. The nonprofit, based in Washington, describes itself as a “progressive research and information center dedicated to comprehensively monitoring, analyzing, and correcting conservative misinformation in the U.S. media.”

According to a Senate Democratic Joint Economic Committee report released in early November, the average American household will pay about $100 more for electricity this year, with electric bills rising in 47 states.

New Jersey has the goal of 100 percent clean electricity by 2035, meaning all electricity sold in the state must come from “clean” sources under its strengthened Clean Energy Standard. This is accompanied by targets like 11 GW of offshore wind by 2040 and 2 GW of energy storage by 2030. But these are long-term build-outs, many of which are still being procured and, in the case of offshore wind, have faced challenges due to the retreat in federal support for the sector.

“The extreme hikes we are currently seeing are almost entirely attributable to data centers and their tremendous load,” Brian Lipman, director of New Jersey Rate Counsel, an independent state agency representing electricity consumers, said in an email.

PJM Interconnection, the regional grid operator for Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic states, estimates that data centers alone will add about 30 GW in demand for the entire region by 2030, a demand equivalent to adding about 20 million homes to the grid.

Brendan Pierpont, the energy modeling chief of nonpartisan energy and climate think tank Energy Innovation, also pointed to PJM Interconnection’s slow progress in connecting more projects to the grid to match the increased demand.

As of Nov. 12, there are about 1,330 projects totaling at least 100 GW in capacity that are still waiting for interconnection with PJM. Most of the projects held up are renewables. According to a report by energy market intelligence firm Aurora Energy Research, if even about 10 percent of those renewables could be connected by 2026, they could have reduced the capacity price—the charge on electric bills that largely drove the recent price hikes—by about a quarter.

“The reason bills are going up is a simple supply and demand problem. PJM has not built enough supply while also not planning for an increase in demand from data centers,” said Alex Ambrose, an analyst with the nonpartisan think tank New Jersey Policy Perspective. “All those energy projects aren’t waiting in a queue for Governor Murphy’s approval. They’re waiting for PJM approval.”

Fox News, The Wall Street Journal and the New York Post did not respond to requests for comment.

As for plant retirements, coal plants like Logan and Chambers shut in 2022, and Oyster Creek nuclear plant closed in 2018. Keeping facilities like these running would mean expensive upgrades to meet tighter pollution rules. Retiring them avoids those upgrade costs and cuts pollution that drives asthma and premature deaths.

“Coal plants were uneconomic—they could not make enough money in the markets prior to the data center load. In fact, the coal plants in New Jersey were tied to expensive out-of-market contracts and their closure led to savings for New Jersey ratepayers,” Lipman said.

According to tracking by Media Matters, Murdoch-owned outlets laid the groundwork as early as August by blaming New Jersey’s higher electricity bills on green mandates and plant closures.

The opinion articles coincided with the gubernatorial campaign in the Garden State, where Democratic candidate Mikie Sherrill triumphed against Republican Jack Ciattarelli.

A Wall Street Journal op-ed by energy executive Paul H. Tice in early August faulted fossil-fuel retirements and the state’s 2035 clean-power target. Two days later, a New York Post op-ed tied hikes to “Democrats’ bungled energy policies.”

Within three days, Fox & Friends and America’s Newsroom followed with reports linking price spikes to coal and nuclear shutdowns. The segments briefly included a counterpoint from then-Democratic gubernatorial candidate Sherrill, who instead put the onus on PJM Interconnection.

Then the drumbeat intensified. Fox Business’ The Big Money Show accused a “green-obsessed” outgoing Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy of driving up costs. Three days later, the New York Post editorial board said “insane” clean energy policies were to blame, and Fox & Friends further amplified that line with commentary, claiming without basis that summer bills had “tripled” and that Democrats prioritize climate over affordability.

President Donald Trump jumped in on August 19, railing against wind and solar on his social media site Truth Social. Trump called them a “scam” and vowed to block them.

Meanwhile, in its endorsement of Republican Ciattarelli on Sept. 27, the New York Post editorial board claimed Democrats’ push for zero emissions sent bills soaring. A day after, The Wall Street Journal editorial board faulted clean-energy targets and restrictions against gas projects for rising prices.

“[The] actual Democratic policy in New Jersey, and nationwide, is deliberate energy scarcity—and the higher prices that go with it,” the editorial board, which is separate from its news operations, wrote.

Energy experts have sought to correct these claims.

“New Jersey has been a clean energy policy leader for decades, and if you look back to 2010, electricity prices were more or less flat for over a decade, rising slower than inflation until the recent PJM capacity market price surge,” said Pierpont in an email.

Lipman at the New Jersey Rate Counsel said that while some solar and energy-efficiency subsidies appear on people’s bills, they did not drive this summer’s sharp price increases, and short-term price bumps from offshore wind have yet to show up on bills because they haven’t been built and connected to the grid.

Allison Fisher, the climate and energy director of Media Matters, said this pattern wasn’t new. Murdoch-owned outlets repeatedly blamed clean energy for higher electricity prices to undercut the Inflation Reduction Act both before and after its passage in 2022, she said.

“Years before this moment, we already knew what the playbook was. So it definitely was not a surprise,” said Fisher.

The event fostered substantive discussions on next-generation solar systems, the strategic value of battery energy storage systems (BESS) in the energy transition, evolving two-part tariff structures, and targeted, forward-looking investment solutions. More than 100 attendees from industry associations, leading companies, and ecosystem partners joined the session to shape the future of clean energy in Vietnam.

Seizing Opportunities, Ushering in a New Era for Residential Solar

In a keynote address, Ms. Shen Lu, national general distributor for Shenzhen Skyworth Photovoltaic Technology Co., Ltd. (“Skyworth PV”) in Vietnam, delivered a comprehensive analysis of the current landscape and future trajectory of Vietnam’s residential solar market. She emphasized Vietnam’s exceptional solar energy resources, noting an average annual sunlight exceeding 2,000 hours, which provides a natural foundation for solar power generation. At present, however, PV applications are mostly seen in large ground-mounted power stations and commercial or industrial rooftop systems, with relatively limited adoption among ordinary households.

Simplifying Complexity, Redefining Home Solar

To address these market gaps, Skyworth PV announced the official launch of its SUN Mate Home Solar 2.0 solution, the result of extensive market research and technological innovation. The core proposition of this new offering is “making clean energy accessible,” effectively transforming complex solar power generation into a product as straightforward and user-friendly as a standard household appliance.

A defining feature of the SUN Mate series is its “plug-and-play” design. Unlike conventional solar installations that require professional design, complex construction, and structural modifications, SUN Mate truly achieves a “three no” principle: no design, no construction, and no modification needed. Homeowners are freed from concerns about complex installation requirements; whether for urban apartment balconies or rural home courtyards, a suitable and simple installation solution is readily available.

In everyday use, SUN Mate delivers equally impressive performance. The system produces power during daylight hours for direct household consumption, significantly cutting grid electricity usage and cost. Through Skyworth’s proprietary smart cloud platform and mobile app, users can monitor real-time generation data and equipment status, and connect with professional customer service when needed. This intelligent management experience—making solar energy “visible, manageable, and affordable”—enables households to adopt solar power effortlessly.

Versatile Designs for Vietnamese Homes

To enable broader clean energy adoption across Vietnamese households, Skyworth PV has engineered three distinct SUN Mate product configurations, each meticulously optimized for specific settings.

The Balcony Model fits modern urban living. Its compact structure and minimalist design enable seamless integration with various architectural styles. The unique bracket-based setup requires no special tools and preserves building structures, making installation possible even for apartment dwellers. Designed to withstand Vietnam’s rainy and windy seasons, the model offers enhanced stability to maintain safety and reliability in adverse weather conditions.

The Awning Model strategically combines power generation with practical shade provision, making it particularly suitable for storefronts or the exteriors of owner-built houses. It not only supplies electricity and cuts energy costs, but also creates comfortable shaded spaces, delivering multiple functional benefits. Its stylish design also enhances a building’s visual appeal.

The Ground Model has drawn widespread attention for its superior adaptability. It supports angle adjustments between 25 and 40 degrees, allowing users to easily position it for optimal power generation based on seasonal variations and sun angles. Suitable for family yards, terraces, or campsites, the unit can also be folded and relocated with ease—bringing portable clean energy wherever needed.

As awareness of clean energy grows and technology continues advancing, residential solar power is transitioning from a premium alternative to an essential household solution.

""Carney’s deal with Danielle Smith is the sellout of the century: scrapping climate legislation for a pipeline that will never be built,"" said Lewis, a veteran journalist and climate activist.
In response to the deal, the minister of Canadian culture, Steven Guilbeault, who formerly served as environment minister under the previous Liberal administration, resigned in protest.
""Filling this pipeline and expansion would require more oil sands mining, leading to more carbon pollution, more tailings, and worse impacts for communities near the tar sands,"" warned Brooks.
""The pipeline to BC would have to cross some of the most challenging terrain in Canada.","First Nations groups backed by environmental and conservationist allies in Canada are denouncing a pipeline and tanker infrastructure agreement announced Thursday between Liberal Prime Minister Mark Carney and Conservative Alberta Premier Danielle Smith, calling it a betrayal and promising to fight its implementation tooth and nail.

“We will use every tool in our toolbox to ensure that this pipeline does not go ahead,” said Heiltsuk Nation Chief Marilyn Slett in response to the Carney-Smith deal that would bring tens of millions of barrels of tar sands oil from Alberta to the coast of British Columbia for export by building new pipeline and lifting a moratorium against oil tankers operating in fragile British Columbia coastal water.

While Carney, who argues that the pipeline is in Canada's economic interest, had vowed to secure the support of First Nations before finalizing any agreement with Alberta, furious reactions to the deal made it clear that promise was not met.

Xhaaidlagha Gwaayaai, the president of the Haida nation, was emphatic: ""This project is not going to happen.""

The agreement, according to the New York Times, is part of Carney’s ""plan to curb Canada’s trade dependence on the United States, swings Canadian policy away from measures meant to fight climate change to focus instead on growing the oil and gas industry.""

In a statement, the Union of British Columbia Indian Chiefs (UBCIC) ""loudly"" voiced its opposition to the memorandum of understanding signed by Carney and Smith.

""This MOU is nothing less than a high-risk and deeply irresponsible agreement that sacrifices Indigenous peoples, coastal communities, and the environment for political convenience,"" said Grand Chief Stewart Phillip, president of the UBCIC. ""By explicitly endorsing a new bitumen pipeline to BC's coast and promising to rewrite the Oil Tanker Moratorium Act, the federal government is resurrecting one of the most deeply flawed and divisive ideas in Canadian energy politics.""

Slett, who serves as secretary-treasurer of the UBCIC, said the agreement ""was negotiated without the involvement of the very Nations who would shoulder those risks, and to suggest ‘Indigenous co-ownership’ of a pipeline while ignoring the clear opposition of Coastal First Nations is unacceptable.""

Avi Lewis, running for the leadership of the progressive New Democratic Party (NDP) in the upcoming elections, decried the agreement as a failure of historic proportions.

""Carney’s deal with Danielle Smith is the sellout of the century: scrapping climate legislation for a pipeline that will never be built,"" said Lewis, a veteran journalist and climate activist. ""We need power lines, not pipelines. Our path is through climate leadership and building good jobs in the clean economy.""

In response to the deal, the minister of Canadian culture, Steven Guilbeault, who formerly served as environment minister under the previous Liberal administration, resigned in protest.

“Despite this difficult economic context, I remain one of those for whom environmental issues must remain front and center,” Guilbeault said in a statement.

""Over the past few months, several elements of the climate action plan I worked on as Minister of the Environment have been, or are about to be, dismantled,” he said. “In my view, these measures remain essential to our climate action plan.”

David Eby, the premier of British Columbia who opposes the new pipeline into his province and was not included in the discussions between Carney and Smith, echoed those who said the project is more dead than alive, despite the MOU, calling it a potential ""energy vampire"" that would distracts from better energy solutions that don't carry all the baggage of this proposed project.

“With all of the variables that have yet to be fulfilled—no proponent, no route, no money, no First Nations support—that it cannot draw limited federal resources, limited Indigenous governance resources, limited provincial resources away from the real projects that will employ people,” Eby added.

Keith Brooks, the program director at Environmental Defence, decried the deal as ""worse than we had anticipated"" and ""a gift to the oil industry and Alberta Premier Smith, at the expense of practically everyone else.""

""Filling this pipeline and expansion would require more oil sands mining, leading to more carbon pollution, more tailings, and worse impacts for communities near the tar sands,"" warned Brooks. ""The pipeline to BC would have to cross some of the most challenging terrain in Canada. The impacts of construction would be severe, and the impacts of a spill, devastating.""

Jessica Green, a professor at the University of Toronto focused on environmental politics, equated the ""reckless"" deal to a ""climate dumpster fire"" and called the push for more tar sands pipelines in Canada ""the energy equivalent [of] investing in VHS tapes in 2025.""",https://www.commondreams.org/media-library/image.jpg?id=62255977&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C166%2C0%2C167,N,,2025-11-29 12:02:29.582741
,Texas Environment,2025-11-29 15:13:05+00:00,Rio Grande Guardian,Raise Your Hand Texas: We propose the 'Legacy Education Fund' endowment,Raise Your Hand Texas,,,,,"https://riograndeguardian.com/stories/raise-your-hand-texas-we-propose-the-legacy-education-fund-endowment,47677","To address this, Raise Your Hand Texas proposes creating a “Legacy Education Fund,” a new endowment that could broaden funding sources and increase resources for schools across the state.
“The ‘Legacy Education Fund’ is about preparing Texas schools for the future—thinking 10 to 20 years ahead, not just the next budget cycle.
How the Legacy Education Fund would work The “Legacy Education Fund” could operate as an endowment working alongside the existing Permanent School Fund (PSF).
“The ‘Legacy Education Fund’ is about adding new dollars to the system, not just moving the same money,” Popinski said.
Decisions made during the 90th Legislative Session, set to begin in January 2027, could establish a new direction for funding Texas public education.","Texas has one of the nation’s largest and fastest-growing economies, yet its per-student public school funding remains in the bottom 10 nationally. During the 89th Legislative Session, lawmakers approved House Bill 2, providing $8.5 billion in public education funding for the 2025-26 biennium.

Despite billions invested during the 89th Legislative Session, school districts still face many challenges, including school closures, staff layoffs, and budget deficits.

To address this, Raise Your Hand Texas proposes creating a “Legacy Education Fund,” a new endowment that could broaden funding sources and increase resources for schools across the state.

“We can’t keep waiting for each legislative session to patch the same school funding gaps,” said Bob Popinski, dean of policy for Raise Your Hand Texas. “The ‘Legacy Education Fund’ is about preparing Texas schools for the future—thinking 10 to 20 years ahead, not just the next budget cycle. There will be an estimated $28.5 billion in our Economic Stabilization Fund, also known as the Rainy Day Fund. That money could help seed a new endowment fund to support public education in ways our current funding methods cannot.”

Texas schools are under financial pressure

In Texas classrooms, the effects of underfunding are visible daily. Students face larger class

sizes and fewer resources; teachers take on heavier workloads; support staff cover extra duties; and district leaders stretch budgets to cover the essentials. Rising costs, inflation, and new state mandates make the challenge even more difficult.

Despite the Texas Legislature’s recent investment, Texas spends about $3,500 less per student than the national average. The state’s two-year budget cycle adds uncertainty, forcing schools to make long-term commitments without dependable support.

“Districts are constantly stretching resources to cover basic needs,” Popinski said. “Without steady, long-term funding, they’re busy fighting fires and catching up instead of investing in student success.”

The proposed “Legacy Education Fund” aims to address this challenge by providing a reliable, supplemental revenue source.

How the Legacy Education Fund would work

The “Legacy Education Fund” could operate as an endowment working alongside the existing Permanent School Fund (PSF). Funded through an initial investment, the fund’s principal would be invested to generate earnings, which would be distributed to support education across the state. This creates a self-sustaining revenue source that grows over time, providing schools with financial stability.

Currently, funding sources such as lottery proceeds and the PSF help pay for public education through formulas set by the Texas Legislature. However, neither of these increases the total dollars flowing into classrooms; they determine how schools receive funding, not how much funding they receive.

“The ‘Legacy Education Fund’ is about adding new dollars to the system, not just moving the same money,” Popinski said. “It would provide schools with additional funding on top of what they already receive. The goal isn’t to replace existing support but to strengthen it, giving districts a more stable and predictable foundation.”

Benefits for schools

The “Legacy Education Fund” would give Texas schools more than funding. It would provide Texas with:

● Durability: guaranteeing future funding regardless of the political or economic climate

● Diversified funding streams: introducing reliable funding sources beyond current school funding

● Stability: allowing districts to make long-term decisions without worrying about the uncertainty in two-year state budgets

● Competitive investment: fueling economic growth, promoting healthier communities, enhancing quality of life, and setting Texas on the path to match other states’ investments in public school students

● Legacy: establishing an endowment as a permanent promise to Texas kids and the down payment on a quality education

Other states, including Alabama, Colorado, Mississippi, and Connecticut, have established public education endowments funded by general revenue and private contributions. These funds effectively support various school needs—from core expenses to programs, technology, and facility improvements—showing the potential impact a similar approach could have in Texas.

It’s time for lawmakers to take action

During the 90th Legislative Session, legislators have the opportunity to create a different type of permanent, growing funding source that could transform public schools for decades.

If lawmakers take action during the next legislative session, Texas could move beyond short-term fixes and provide districts with a stable, predictable foundation to meet current and future needs.

The fund’s implementation—initial investment, ongoing contributions, and governance—will shape the long-term impact on Texas schools. Decisions made during the 90th Legislative Session, set to begin in January 2027, could establish a new direction for funding Texas public education.",https://gamma.creativecirclecdn.com/riogrande/original/20250430-134218-887-ryht-building-exterior-congress.jpg,N,,2025-11-29 11:01:16.964995

As you shop this Small Business Saturday, remember how rulemakers in Washington impact your costs and your choices.","When you’re in line at your favorite small business on Small Business Saturday, you’re probably not thinking about how the rules the government creates affect your purchases. Here in Washington, D.C., it’s easy for policymakers and bureaucrats to lose sight of how poorly crafted rules can impact your costs at the point of sale, or how paperwork burdens hamper the ability of your favorite local shop to provide excellent service and a robust selection of merchandise.

Start with the mountain of paperwork that the boutique or specialty store you’re frequenting faces. These direct costs hurt that store’s margins and take up time for the owner and the staff as they provide a service to you and your community. That, in turn, makes your experience whenever you shop more painful than it should be.

Paperwork comes in lots of forms. For instance, the Internal Revenue Service requires every business with employees, from the largest tech companies to the smallest boutique, to file Form 941, the “Employer’s Quarterly Tax Return,” four times per year.

Chief Counsel Casey B. Mulligan has done extensive research on this form and finds that it is the fifth largest paperwork burden the government puts on citizens, accounting for 470 million hours of time.

Moving to yearly reporting would save small businesses 224 million hours and $20.1 billion annually, freeing up time for your favorite local businesses to increase staffing at the register and lower their prices. That allows these shops to pass those lower costs onto you.

Washington’s paperwork burden does not only come in the form of tax forms. Rules like the Consumer Product Safety Commission Certificates of Compliance require additional paperwork in the form of product registration for every single import and increase the stakes for clerical errors.

If you are buying a German board game for your brother, or a Japanese collectible for your daughter, the small hobby shop that imports your purchase must electronically upload a slew of information for each unique product. If there are any inconsistencies at Customs, the shipment is flagged for additional review. That means delays, rejections, or seizure for the business, and an unhappy Christmas for your family.

These paperwork burdens are so severe that Advocacy has placed both Form 941 and the certificates of compliance rule on our list of Most Wanted reforms. Washington’s choice to bury America’s Main Street under mountains of paperwork affects your time in line and your ability to choose what to buy your family for the holidays.

These problems are only the tip of the iceberg. The stores you frequent also deal with upstream, or indirect costs, from rules. If the government imposes rules that lead to costs on producers of raw materials or manufactured goods, those producers then must pass those costs down to wholesalers, retailers, or consumers. Worst of all, the impact analyses that agencies conduct to demonstrate the costs of these rules on small businesses often do not consider these indirect costs at all.

A rule like the Occupational Safety and Health Administration’s Heat Injury and Illness Prevention rule is a good example. The decorations you might pick up for Christmas at your local winter market might become more expensive because the small manufacturers that produce them would be required to meet very specific heat-mitigation requirements. Many of those requirements are burdensome thanks to a one-size-fits-all standard.

Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations that set fuel emissions standards also drive up the costs of your holiday. If the local tree farm needs to switch to a more efficient vehicle, it costs thousands of dollars, and those costs get passed on to you. Under President Trump, the EPA is removing those regulations, with a potential cost savings in the hundreds of billions of dollars.

As you shop this Small Business Saturday, remember how rulemakers in Washington impact your costs and your choices.

Net Power (NYSE:NPWR) is an exciting utilities company with a unique patented technology which could transform the energy markets in the US. Data centers is at the epicenter of electricity demand in the US and because of the attractive production model NPWR and low cost of scaling its a lucrative bet on this.

Technology

Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with NPWR.

Is NPWR fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.

NPWR has a patented protected technology which uses natural gas and oxygen for its two inputs. The two elements are combusted which produces CO2 and water. This drives a turboexpander which is what produces the electricity. What makes it so special is that once the water has been moved out and separated the CO2 is returned to the turboexpander which powers it a second time, which as you might guess increases output and efficiency. Once there is too much CO2 produced it is pumped out of the system into underground storages.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimates that in 2021, methane emissions from natural gas and petroleum systems and from abandoned oil and natural gas wells were the source of about 33% of total U.S. methane emissions and about 4% of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions.

Natural gas is a much cleaner energy supply, but it can be even cleaner with the proprietary technology that NPWR has. The CO2 that gets pumped out would end up in two different locations, either class II wells where its later used to increase productivity at oil and gas production sites. The second option is class VI cells where it is sealed off and stored for all eternity.

Allam-Fetvedt Cycle

The Allam-Fetvedt Cycle is what enables NPWR to be a large-scale power generation company eventually. Once it went public it came with this technology as a patent and have exclusive rights. It adds on the image you see above here.

In commercial use it would when electricity prices are low produce oxygen with energy and then store this as a liquid. When prices increase this stored oxygen would then be used to produce electricity.

This oxygen storage method makes it one of the most cost-effective and long-duration energy storages in the world. It makes it incredibly attractive for data centers as it provides moderate balancing and higher potential returns too. Testing for this is done at the La Forte site in Texas along with scaling equipment for Baker Hughes.

Looking ahead, we expect to complete Phase 1 of the program this year. Phase 2 will commence later this year and most likely conclude in early 2026. Additionally, design and site preparations are already underway for Phases 3 and 4, which are scheduled for completion in 2026 and 2027, respectively.

During the last quarter it had meaningful progress at the site and plans seem to be on schedule so far. Start-up speed has increased, plant automation added and overall plant performance has gone up.

Pathway

NPWR is on track to deliver 97% carbon capture starting with its Project Permian. It's the company's first expected commercial-scale facility for using its technology. It will begin in the Midland of Texas. The project began construction in Q3 2024 and is expected to be finished and up and running in 2028 hopefully. During this period there has been revision to the cost, the latest pointing to $1.7 - 2 billion, up from the original $750 - 950 million.

The CEO Danny Rice blamed the cause on inflationary impacts on prices and increased interest in building gas-turbines causing bottlenecks.

The cost was a little bit of a surprise take a step back and look at where we can cut costs without cutting safety and reliability

Cost-cutting is where the focus should be right now in scaling its project. It's financially stable with a large cash pile, but raising further capital through equity will negatively impact the share price and investor morale.

We've seen the last couple of years a shift in the market to as much natural gas generation as possible. It's the only thing that can scale to the amount needed and offers affordability

This is what NPWR is playing on. History can teach us that power demand will be explosive during this data center buildout. Between 2000 and 2005 the US power demand increased by 90%, and a further 24% between 2005 and 2009. The forecasts during that period where largely overstated, predicting major power outages which never happened.

Interestingly, between 2010 and 2018 demand was basically flat because of new technological advancements which reduced the consumption at the same time making them more efficient. Some models point to between 200 TWh/year to 1,050 TWh/year by 2030. For context, on the higher end it would represent a quarter of the US annual electricity generation in 2023 (which was 4,178 TWh/year). Most of the assumptions puts 2030 consumption at 325 TWh/year to 580 TWh/year, representing between 6.5 - 12.5% of the USs annual electricity production.

Because of the massive ramp up companies are searching for any opportunity out there. The tech giants like Meta Platforms (META) and Amazon (AMZN) are eying nuclear power to support the buildout. Because gas is the fastest to scale it's also what makes NPWR such a lucrative investment right now, because it's not only a play on increased power demand, but clean power. With 97% carbon capture efficiency it will be more attractive for companies to get their energy from it in order to meet emission quotas.

Technology At Scale

NPWR plans that its power plants will be factory produced modular facilities which directly drives down both costs and increases the rate of scaling.

The company is still in the early stages so they aren't posting too many financial models where revenues might land. But from a 2023 analyst day presentation they presented some compelling cases in terms of scalability. The chart shows the impact of different numbers of plants deployed per year in EBITDA. At 10 on the middle range of 15 per year it would translate into nearly $1 billion EBITDA. Seeing as most utilities companies trade at 11 - 12x EV/EBITDA it makes a compelling case that NPWR might have a lot of upside seeing as its current market cap is just below $700 million, or $282 million in EV.

With the delays which occurred in 2025 due to rising costs it seems that 2028 will now be the year when the first site goes online. NPWR is backed by Occidental Petroleum (OXY) so it made sense the first site would be at one of its assets.

There have been some material changes from this original business plan where it would sell the plants to companies and receive a license fee from this. That is what the chart showed. But because of the rise in data center demand NPWR is changing and looking to operate its assets fully instead, or selling part stakes to private equity to raise cash in the short-term. This should increase liquidity and make scaling both faster and less leveraged.

In the presentation it outlined how a fully stand alone Net Power plant can generate 415 MWs per day with 50 million cubic feet of natural gas inputs per day. This comes out to 550 megawatts of thermal input where 80% becomes power.

In just a few short months, Project Permian LCOE has meaningfully improved from over $150 per megawatt hour to now under $100 per megawatt hour,

During the Q2 call management outlined the cost-reductions made to LCOE (levelized cost of electricity).

With the new integration they also state they are confident in getting below $100 MWh LCOE right out of the gate. We're kind of sitting in a place where if we're starting in that $1.6 billion to $1.9 billion sort of zip code, we feel pretty good about being able to get down to the $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion range -- $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion for the stand-alone net power unit.

Over time NPWR is targeting a lower cost of unit as well, which as stated before, due to the better integration of CO2 among other things, getting below $100 MWh LCOE seems reasonable. It is however promising to see the cost per unit falling so drastically as the company builds more.

Between 2021 and 2023 Texas averaged about $117 MWh in wholesale electricity prices. During 2025 so far the blended rate between all three categories as seen above is $133.2 MWh. This gives NPWR a gross profit of at least $33.2 per MW. It stated that one unit produces 415 MWh/day which is $1.3 million in daily revenues, $39.8 million in monthly revenues and $484 million annually. Based on the LCOE and current market price each unit would run at about 33 - 35% gross margins, $159 million gross profits.

Here is a cost breakdown of what one plant would look like. Assuming the same market price as today net income is $11.5 million. These are rough estimates which is the best I can do until the company actually has started to produce and sell. LCOE is interesting here as it covers all costs associated with producing.

CEO Daniel Rice pointed to it potentially going below $80 eventually as the core Capex in the cycle goes down with time.NPWR is investing $2 billion for the Permian Basin site, which should result in $100 million annual depreciation, laid out over 20 years. As costs come down this should normalize at $60 million instead. Added back in cash flows are $251 million which is strong, showing that investments might eventually pay for themselves.

Here is the bull case scenario for NPWR. Sales have gone to $175 MWh which is driven by increased demand from data centers, increasing population and other. LCOE goes down to $80 MWh as outlined by the CEO. Cost per unit goes down to bringing depreciation to $60 million annually. Overall, FCF of $338 million and net income of $178 million.

NPWR hasn't set a specific plan which outlines how many plants they intend on making in the next 10 years, but the CEO mentions 20 years somewhat frequently along with 10 - 20 units made. During 10 years I'll make the assumption that NPWR will build another 5 to be conservative. The first in 2028 and the rest afterwards. Seeing as NPWR won't realize the bull case model until later on I'll make my projections using the first one for the year 2035.

Revenue $2.42 billion

Operating income $795 million

Free Cash Flow $1.255 billion

Net Income $57.5 million

I'm expecting a certain level of equity financing which will dilute shares over 10 years. Raising between $60 - $70 million annually would today require to raise the outstanding amount by 10% give or take. Once NPWR starts to generate more FCF I see the dilution rate normalizing at 5 - 6% annually. So by year 2035 shares would be 129 million and EPS $0.44. Based on today's price that is a P/E of 7.95. Based on cash flows its $9.72 per share or 0.36x FWD FCF.

The sector averages 20x FWD earnings and 16x FWD FCF. This shows the clear upside in share price NPWR could undergo during the next 10 years if it manages to establish just 5 units.It's a small company which is still in the early days but has a massive run up. Industry tailwinds are strong and not likely to fade. Power demand is here now and it's not waiting, which makes the case for rising electricity costs by 2035 even if supply grows. I'm not new to small caps like this and I'm experienced with the volatility that comes with it.",https://media.zenfs.com/en/us.finance.gurufocus/04dd6a9443291883d9ec4829dc7936ce,N,,2025-11-29 13:01:42.733602

CEDI’s mission is to ensure that the clean energy transition creates local prosperity, climate stability, and energy security for all Iowans.","We deserve stronger cost controls and greater ratepayer protections in Alliant Energy’s proposed New Wind III project, which is currently seeking approval by the Iowa Utilities Commission (IUC).

I'm a policy analyst for the Clean Energy Districts of Iowa (CEDI) and an intervenor in Alliant Energy's rate cases. I most recently testified in Docket No. RPU-2025-0003, which involves Alliant’s request for advance ratemaking principles to support up to 1,000 megawatts of new wind generation. My testimony emphasizes customer affordability, transparency, and accountability as key to ensuring that new clean energy investments benefit all Iowans.

The bottom line is that clean energy must be affordable and equitable. If a utility cannot show that new wind projects provide net economic benefits for customers via utility ownership, they should not be financing them through rates paid by customers. Alliant customers should not be paying for any utility investment that benefits shareholders more than ratepayers.

Specifically, here are CEDI's key recommendations on the New Wind project:

• Reduce Alliant’s’ proposed cost cap of $3,020/kW, which is 26% higher than a similar project approved earlier this year.

• Deny recovery of undocumented ‘Owner’s Costs’ lacking supporting data.

• Adopt a lower return on equity (ROE) of 8% to 9% instead of the company’s requested 11.25%, aligning with recent independent assessments.

• Limit future turbine repowering cost recovery to Alliant’s cost of debt, not its full ROE.

• Restrict approval to projects that qualify for federal Production Tax Credits (PTCs) and demonstrate net customer benefits.

• Add a new Resource Evaluation Study principle to improve transparency, stakeholder engagement, and long-term planning.

New data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration shows Iowa’s coal generation has increased by 46.5% year-to-date, while natural gas generation declined and renewable output rose only slightly. Commercial electricity prices increased about 8% over the same period.

These are trends in the wrong direction. Iowa needs more clean energy, but the investments must be responsible, cost-effective, and fair to customers.

If you have questions about rate increases, how energy works among Iowa's private utilities, or what you can do to make your home or business more energy efficient, read more about CEDI (www.cleanenergydistricts.org). This nonprofit consortium represents 14 locally governed energy districts that each help households, farms, and businesses benefit from the clean energy transition through education, technical assistance, and advocacy.

The first photovoltaic cells were invented at Bell Laboratories in the early 1950s (research subsidized by federal grants). In the 1970s, the United States was implementing this technology to become the world’s manufacturing leader of solar panels (again subsidized by federal grants). But who is the world’s manufacturing leader of solar panels today? China!

This short-sightedness plays out repeatedly. The United States invents new technologies, but it is other countries who mass manufacture them. Think semiconductors, personal computers, smartphones, LCD displays, etc. We don’t support the initial start-up production of our own inventions.

Unfortunately, this seems to be happening again. The Inflation Reduction Act supplied new funds to support solar, wind, and geothermal production. Many innovative projects got started and were on their way to providing new jobs and needed energy production. But the Big Beautiful Bill eliminated most of this support and today there are many energy projects that were near completion but are now stalled and going nowhere.

This is so short-sighted. Solar, wind, and nuclear energy production is a needed piece of our future, regardless of what you might believe about human-caused climate change. So why are we still subsiding in coal, oil, and gas production to the tune of $34.8 billion a year and starving nuclear, solar, wind, and geothermal start-ups?

Suspending the regime in Alberta was one component of a sweeping energy pact unveiled Thursday between Prime Minister Mark Carney and Premier Danielle Smith. The regulations were suspended on the condition Alberta adopt a stronger industrial carbon pricing regime.

Article content

“We have always said that if a province has an equivalent set of regulations that deliver the same outcomes as the clean electricity regulations, we are prepared to enter into equivalency agreements with those provinces,” Hodgson said in a phone interview.

Provinces including Ontario, Saskatchewan and New Brunswick have criticized the federal rules, particularly for the constraints they place on building new gas-fired power plants.

Article content

The federal government set a deadline of April 1 for Alberta to come up with improvements to its industrial carbon markets, known as the Technology Innovation and Emissions Reduction System, or TIER.

Article content

Alberta’s system will ramp up to “a minimum effective credit price” of C$130 ($93) per tonne, according to the pact. The province will also commit to “globally competitive, long-term carbon effective prices, carbon levy recycling protocols, and sector-specific stringency factors.”

The energy pact rolled back other Trudeau-era environmental policies, including scrapping an emissions cap on the oil and gas sector and contemplating exemptions to a ban on oil tankers along the coast of northern British Columbia. The moves have generated controversy and played a part in the resignation from cabinet of Culture Minister Steven Guilbeault, a former high-profile environmental activist.

By technology, alkaline electrolyzers accounted for largest market share in 2024.

Based on technology, the Electrolyzers Market is segmented into alkaline, proton exchange membrane (PEM), solid oxide, and anion exchange membrane (AEM). The alkaline segment, by technology, held the largest market share in 2024 due to its technological maturity, lower cost, and suitability for large industrial hydrogen production. Demand for PEM electrolyzers is growing rapidly due to their ability to respond quickly to variable renewable energy sources and produce high-purity hydrogen. Solid oxide electrolyzers offer high efficiency and are gaining traction in high-temperature industrial applications, while AEM electrolyzers are emerging as a low-cost alternative for distributed and small-scale hydrogen generation.

AEM electrolyzers to record highest CAGR during forecast period.

AEM electrolyzers are expected to register the highest CAGR in the global Electrolyzers Market during the forecast period. AEM technology is gaining rapid traction due to its potential to combine the low-cost advantages of alkaline systems with improved efficiency and compact designs similar to PEM electrolyzers. This makes AEM particularly attractive for distributed hydrogen production, small- to medium-sized industrial users, and emerging fuel applications where cost competitiveness and system flexibility are critical. The strong growth of AEM electrolyzers is further supported by increasing R&D investments, declining material costs, and the development of non-precious metal catalysts, which reduce overall system CAPEX. Their compatibility with intermittent renewable energy and lower balance-of-plant complexity makes them suitable for decentralized green hydrogen projects across residential, commercial, and industrial segments. As countries accelerate the adoption of hydrogen and support innovation-driven technologies, AEM systems are becoming one of the most promising next-generation solutions within the electrolyzer technology landscape.

Europe to be fastest-growing market for electrolyzers during forecast period.

Europe is projected to remain a key growth hub in the global Electrolyzers Market, driven by accelerated clean energy investments, stringent emissions regulations, and strong regional focus on energy security. The increasing deployment of hydrogen-ready industrial clusters, cross-border hydrogen corridors, and large-scale storage projects is boosting the adoption of electrolyzers across multiple sectors. The region is also advancing flagship green hydrogen initiatives linked to aviation fuels, maritime transport, and district heating. Policy mechanisms such as IPCEI funding, national tenders, and Contracts for Difference are enabling project bankability. Leading European manufacturers are scaling gigafactories, thereby reinforcing Europe's position as a leader in technology and innovation.

Forward-Looking Statements The information in this press release includes “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding expectations, hopes, beliefs, intentions or strategies regarding the future.","The world has entered a supply chain cold war where data, authenticity, and material truth matter more than speed or scale. Western companies are discovering they cannot compete with state-controlled systems unless they can verify the origin and purity of the materials they depend on. SMX (NASDAQ:SMX) stepped into this gap with molecular-level verification that embeds identity directly into metals, minerals, and industrial feedstocks. It gives Western manufacturers the clarity they have been missing for years.

This matters because global supply chains have long been shaped by countries that control both production and certification. When a single region dominates refining, processing, and verification, the rest of the world has limited visibility and even less leverage. SMX disrupts that imbalance by giving companies a tool to confirm material integrity without relying on distant facilities, opaque documentation or state-managed audit systems.

The shift transforms verification from a vulnerability into a competitive advantage. SMX allows industries to authenticate the materials they use regardless of where the refining or processing took place. It decentralizes truth, allowing companies to build their compliance, manufacturing and sourcing strategies on facts that cannot be manipulated or hidden inside the supply chain.

Why Western Industries Need Proof to Compete

Western manufacturers are operating under extreme pressure. They are expected to scale clean energy systems, produce advanced semiconductors, rebuild domestic industrial capacity, and secure defense-grade materials at unprecedented speed. None of this works without verified feedstock. Solar companies cannot risk mislabeled silicon. EV manufacturers cannot rely on uncertain, rare-earth sources. Defense contractors cannot accept alloys with unconfirmed origins. Proof is now structural, not optional.

Legacy systems cannot meet these demands. Documentation is lost between jurisdictions. Certificates vary by region. Supply chain records lack uniformity. Risk grows with each transfer point. SMX solves this by embedding identity into the material itself, making verification independent of external paperwork or geopolitical bottlenecks. It gives companies direct control over their own certainty.

That shift is already reshaping procurement strategies. Companies are prioritizing materials with built-in authentication over shipments that arrive with stacks of documents. Regulators are favoring supply chains that can demonstrate instant traceability. Investors are gravitating toward companies that adopt self-verifying materials because they represent lower compliance risk and higher operational resilience. SMX is emerging as the verification framework that supports this new industrial landscape.

A New Geopolitical Framework for Material Truth

A new global paradigm is forming around the ability to guarantee material truth. The winners in the next industrial cycle will not be the regions with the cheapest production. They will be the companies and nations that can provide authenticity at the source, long before a component reaches a factory floor. SMX is creating that framework by giving materials a forensic identity that withstands every transformation.

This identity strengthens the entire value chain. Manufacturers gain predictable feedstock. Compliance teams gain clarity that aligns with rising regulatory expectations. Defense and energy sectors gain supply assurance that does not collapse under geopolitical strain. The result is a system where authenticity is built into the material instead of being reconstructed through paperwork vulnerable to manipulation.

The larger implication is clear. The future of strategic manufacturing will follow the regions and companies that guarantee material integrity. SMX is enabling that shift by giving the world a structure where trust is not granted, assumed or outsourced. It is earned at the molecular level and carried forward by every shipment that enters the modern industrial economy.

About SMX

As global businesses face new and complex challenges relating to carbon neutrality and meeting new governmental and regional regulations and standards, SMX is able to offer players along the value chain access to its marking, tracking, measuring and digital platform technology to transition more successfully to a low-carbon economy.

Amazon is the world’s largest corporate purchaser of renewables, with more than 600 wind and solar projects in the works nationwide, according to the company’s website.
Trump has moved to scuttle major wind and solar energy projects since he returned to the White House in January.
Solar projects must break ground by July to be eligible for tax credits that Congress voted to eliminate years earlier than previously planned.
To date, the group has broken ground on 24 megawatts of solar projects worth more than $20 million that benefit low-income households.","Solar power is surging across the U.S. as costs plummet and companies ramp up large-scale commercial projects, but experts say the green industry faces an uncertain future as the Trump administration scraps federal subsidies that have helped foster growth of the clean energy sector.

Last year, more than 90% of all new U.S. electrical generating capacity came from renewable sources, with solar power accounting for more than 81% — the largest single-year increase from any energy source in two decades, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.

Nationwide, there are enough solar installations to power more than 40 million homes, with utility-scale solar accounting for 71% of that capacity, says the Solar Energy Industries Association. A typical 100 megawatt solar project produces enough energy to power 17,200 average U.S. homes, according to the industry group.

“This growth is a testament to the power of American innovation,” said Abigail Ross Hopper, SEIA’s president and CEO. “We’re building factories, hiring American workers and showing that solar energy means made-in-America energy.”

But Hopper said the growth of the industry will be impacted by the decision of President Donald Trump’s administration to end federal subsidies for solar and other clean energy projects.

The Trump administration’s opposition to solar power creates a “risk driving investment overseas, stifling job creation,” she said, “raising costs on consumers, and handing America’s manufacturing advantage to our competitors.”

“This industry has proven what’s possible when businesses have the certainty to invest,” Hopper said. “If the administration does not reverse its harmful actions that have undermined market certainty, energy costs will rise even further, and the next wave of factories and jobs could be at risk.”

How it works

Solar energy, which was initially developed in the late 1800s, essentially works by converting energy from the sun into power, which produces both electricity and heat.

Solar panels, installed on a rooftop or in a utility-scale array, are generally silicon-based within a metal frame and glass casing. When this material is exposed to photons of sunlight, it releases electrons and produces an electric charge. The current is then converted for use in homes and businesses or to power the electric grid.

The rapid expansion of large-scale solar farms and smaller installations on rooftops in recent years has largely been driven by falling costs for the technology. China, one of the world’s largest solar producers, has pushed the cost of panels down by almost 90% over the past decade, according to energy analysts.

Globally, solar capacity is set to double by 2030, with China, India and other countries leading the charge through massive utility-scale projects and creative financing models.

Meanwhile, major corporations such as Amazon, Tesla and Target are scaling solar quickly to lower their operating costs and reduce their carbon footprint. Amazon is the world’s largest corporate purchaser of renewables, with more than 600 wind and solar projects in the works nationwide, according to the company’s website.

As the technology itself improves, wind and solar are offering some of the cheapest and fastest ways to provide electric power, supporters say.

Administrative priorities

Experts say the industry faces darkening skies as the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress roll back clean energy tax credits and throw up roadblocks to renewable energy projects, which threatens to leave the United States behind other countries in the shift to solar power and renewables.

Trump has moved to scuttle major wind and solar energy projects since he returned to the White House in January.

Trump’s hand-picked Interior Secretary Doug Burgum issued a series of orders earlier this year to restrict solar and wind development, including changing the criteria for evaluating renewable energy projects on federal lands, requiring that the Interior secretary personally approve each project.

“Based on common sense, arithmetic and physics, wind and solar projects are highly inefficient uses of federal lands,” Burgum said in a statement, claiming it will “level the playing field for dispatchable, cost-effective and secure energy sources,” such as “clean” coal and natural gas.

Meanwhile, Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill” Act, signed in July, mandates oil and gas lease sales, fast-tracks environmental reviews and opens millions of acres of public land for coal leasing and terminates incentives for solar power, including one that offered homeowners a federal tax credit of up to $10,500 for installing rooftop solar panels.

Many companies with projects in the works are scrambling to install solar panels, wind turbines and batteries the size of shipping containers before federal tax credits expire or become harder to claim. Solar projects must break ground by July to be eligible for tax credits that Congress voted to eliminate years earlier than previously planned.

In August, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency pulled the plug on the $7 billion Solar for All program, approved by Congress in 2023 as part of the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act to expand solar power to low-income households.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin called it a “boondoggle” that’s “rife with grift” from unscrupulous companies taking cuts from the federally funded grants. The move prompted federal lawsuits from states, labor unions and the solar industry.

Among the companies impacted by the grant freeze is Groundswell, a nonprofit that works in several Southern states, including Georgia, Mississippi and Alabama, which was expecting $156 million. To date, the group has broken ground on 24 megawatts of solar projects worth more than $20 million that benefit low-income households.

“There’s a lot at stake,” Groundswell CEO Michelle Moore said in a statement. “These projects — located in small towns across seven states, all of which were sited in partnership with the local community — now hang in the balance.”

‘No going back’

Environmentalists say, despite the pushback by the Trump administration, the economics of solar are strong and it has proven itself as a valuable renewable energy to help reduce excess greenhouse gas emissions that scientists say are contributing to a warmer planet, fueling devastating storms and rising seas.

“Globally, there is no going back on this,” Kate Sinding Daly, vice president for law and policy at the New England-based Conservation Law Foundation. “Wind and solar are the future of renewable energy. The momentum may be slowed in this country, but it’s not going to be reversed.”

The solar power movement has plenty of critics who argue the full-throttled embrace of clean energy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will ultimately drive up consumer costs, cause rolling blackouts and won’t provide enough electricity to meet demands, among other criticisms.

Lisa Linowes, a New Hampshire-based energy policy analyst, argues that states such as California, New York and Massachusetts are pushing through policies aimed at encouraging the expansion of green energy, which are hurting energy consumers, driving up costs and putting increased pressure on the nation’s electric grid.

“The public is largely in the dark about what’s happening with renewable energy,” she said. “The states and environmentalists who are pushing for a net-zero environment are telling everyone that wind and solar are the cheapest forms of electricity. But the reality is it’s cost-prohibitive, and we just don’t have the land for it.”

One way states are trying to accelerate the shift to solar power through net-metering programs, which allow consumers who install rooftop solar on their homes to pay lower rates for electricity for sharing power with the regional grid. Some states require utilities to buy the electricity generated by solar power at retail prices.

But Linowes and other critics say those programs are largely benefiting homeowners who can afford to install rooftop solar, with ratepayers who aren’t benefiting directly from net-metering picking up the tab. Those costs have added to utility bills in regions such as the northeast, which already has some of the highest energy costs in the nation.

“Net-metering is one of the largest portions of a utility bill in Massachusetts and other states with these programs,” Linowes said. “These policies are hurting energy consumers.”

A recent report by the Fiscal Alliance Foundation, Americans for Prosperity Foundation and other conservative groups looked at six New England states’ decarbonization plans and said it would cost the states $815 billion collectively through 2050, with the average household paying nearly $100 more a year for electricity.

Commercial employers would see their costs rise by about $489 per year, while industrial manufacturing customers would see their electric bills increase by an average of almost $5,280 per year, according to the report. The report’s authors called on policymakers to focus on expanding access to natural gas and other cheaper, reliable sources of energy.

“We should be focusing on a common sense and realistic approach to make energy more affordable for everyone — including investing in reliable and affordable energy sources and avoiding money wasted on these rebate programs and subsidies for expensive and unreliable alternative energy,” said Paul Craney, the Fiscal Alliance’s executive director.

“This approach would lower costs for every household and business in Massachusetts — not just the ones who qualify for tax breaks,” he said.",https://www.cnhi.com/wp-content/themes/cnhi/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-11-29 06:57:19.821542

There has been a sharp increase nationally in communities’ resistance to host a data center.
Data Center Watch, a company that tracks data center opposition, found from May 2024 to March 2025, local opposition had blocked or delayed a total of $64 billion in data center projects, with six blocked entirely and 10 delayed.
Carbon capture and sequestration is a relatively new technology used to sequester carbon dioxide emissions.
The carbon dioxide will be collected via an absorption process, compressed, and then injected into Class VI injection wells.","Residents of West Virginia are seeking answers to their questions about proposed data centers/ power plants in their communities. These include a 500-acre data center in Tucker County, the 150-acre ammonia plant and 200,000-square-foot data center which are part of the Adams Fork Energy project on the Logan-Mingo county line, and the Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) project in Mason County. The center proposed in Mason County will “include a power plant, hydrogen production facility, carbon dioxide storage facility, and data center complex.”

There are no federal regulations concerning data centers. However, “in April, Gov. Patrick Morrisey signed House Bill 2014, a law designed to ease in-state data center development in part by prohibiting counties and municipalities from enforcing or adopting regulations that limit creation, development, or operation of any certified microgrid district or high-impact data center project.” Morrisey hailed HB 2014 as the economic development highlight of the West Virginia Legislature’s 2025 regular legislative session.

Unlike politicians, citizens in the state are not convinced that these centers will bring significant economic prosperity to the region. There has been a sharp increase nationally in communities’ resistance to host a data center. Data Center Watch, a company that tracks data center opposition, found from May 2024 to March 2025, local opposition had blocked or delayed a total of $64 billion in data center projects, with six blocked entirely and 10 delayed. From March to June of 2025, $98 billion worth of projects were blocked or delayed. There were over 1,600 citizen comments and most were against the gas turbine-powered data center operation in Tucker County.

Citizens are worried about several issues when it comes to data enters: increases in energy costs, increases in water usage, exposure to toxic substances, and loss of jobs due to Artificial Intelligence (AI). Some projections show that data center energy consumption could double or triple by 2028, accounting for up to 12% of U.S. electricity use. About 56 percent of the electricity used to power data centers is sourced from fossil fuels, and for our region that will mean more fracking for methane gas. Significant amounts of water are needed for cooling purposes. “A study by the International Energy Agency estimates for illustration that a 100-megawatt U.S. data center would consume roughly the same amount of water as 2,600 households.” Additionally, these data centers also use large quantities of PFAS-gas or f-gas chemicals in the cooling phase and in manufacturing some semiconductors. These compounds have been linked to cancer, birth defects, decreased immunity, high cholesterol, kidney disease, and a range of other serious health problems. Finally, citizens fear job losses as AI takes over many entry level positions. “Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei said in a May Axios interview that AI could eliminate half of all entry-level, white-collar jobs within the next five years.”

President Trump is considering an executive order directing the Justice Department to override local regulations and state control of data centers and AI.

The project in Mason County is a “Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage,” and will span 2300 acres when completed and will be powered by burning wood chips. The air permit states 106 tons of wood chips per hour will be combusted. The first question that might come to mind is what trees will be cleared to supply 106 tons per hour? Possibly from the Wayne National Forest which is located just across the river in Ohio.

The air permit for Mason County, which has already been submitted to the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection, shows the levels of hazardous air pollutants will be 24 tons per year. This plant, as well as the Mingo County facility, will be employing carbon dioxide capturing technology. According to a review of the permit for the Mason County plant, “The carbon capture unit has the potential to emit VOC and volatile organic hazardous air pollutants (HAPS) from the carbon capture unit. These HAPs emissions are in the form of nitrosamines, acetaldehyde, and formaldehyde.” These compounds are classified as probable human carcinogens.

Carbon capture and sequestration is a relatively new technology used to sequester carbon dioxide emissions. The carbon dioxide will be collected via an absorption process, compressed, and then injected into Class VI injection wells. Since these wells will be off-site, pipelines will be used to transport the supercritical fluid from the Mason site to the wells.

Currently, the United State Environmental Protection Agency is responsible for permitting Class VI wells. However, West Virginia is one of a few states that has applied for and received primacy to regulate Class VI wells at the state level. Part of the application process requires documented proof that public participation activities were solicited prior to submission of the permit application.

Carbon dioxide, a known asphyxiant, is a dense gas and considered to be hazardous by the OSHA Hazard Communications Standard (29 CFR). It is physiologically active, and affects circulation and breathing. It can accumulate in topographically low areas under conditions of low wind and can travel large distances when released from a ruptured pipeline. It is injected at 1000 psi and can expand to 500 times its volume when exposed to atmospheric pressures. This was evidenced in the pipeline rupture in Satartia, Miss., which sent 45 people to the hospital. How will the mostly volunteer fire departments in West Virginia be able to handle a pipeline break or a leaking Class VI well?

Once again, the communities of West Virginia are being targeted by big out-of-state industries that will make money at the expense of the environment and citizens’ health. Sadly, as usual, the state politicians are welcoming data centers and new power plants which means more extraction and water usage with a promise of questionable local jobs.

Green Amendments Could Fix That - Atmos Magazine,Atmos,,,,,https://atmos.earth/climate-solutions/the-us-constitution-left-out-nature-green-amendments-could-fix-that/,"It is a system that accepts and legalizes environmental pollution and degradation through regulatory reviews and permits.
Green Amendments further require that environmental rights be protected equitably for all communities, regardless of race, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status.
Green Amendments empower people to raise their expectations of government and to advocate more firmly and confidently for environmental protection.
Currently, there are three states with constitutional Green Amendments in place: Pennsylvania, Montana, and New York.
Recognizing the need for transformational change when it comes to environmental protection, and inspired by the progress Green Amendments can and do achieve, over 20 additional states are working with Green Amendments for the Generations, the nonprofit I founded, to secure the powerful protections these Amendments offer.","Across the United States, our state and federal constitutions recognize and protect many cherished rights and freedoms: our right to free speech, to peaceably assemble, to the safety and sanctity of our property, and even to bear arms. But in an oversight of history, these constitutions typically do not recognize the right to drink clean water or breathe clean air, or the right to a safe climate and healthy environment. Instead, these fundamental human rights are entrusted to an imperfect political system in which money, power, and special interests often take precedence over justice and basic human needs—and in which partisan advantage is often more important than facts, science, or human life.

That’s why I believe it’s time to add a Green Amendment to every state constitution in the country.

Rather than recognize a constitutional entitlement to a clean, safe, and healthy environment, here in the U.S., we protect our environment through a patchwork system of legislation and regulation. These laws and regulations are created by a political system dominated by money, partisanship, and narrow concentrations of social and economic influence that actually benefit (financially or politically) from environmental degradation. The resulting system of environmental protection is fundamentally flawed.

Under this system, environmental pollution and degradation is something to be managed, moderated, or mitigated after the fact rather than recognized as a harm that can and should be prevented. It is a system that accepts and legalizes environmental pollution and degradation through regulatory reviews and permits. The law also contains many critical gaps in which environmental harms are not addressed until it is too late, or sometimes not addressed at all.

(For an example, look no further than PFAS, also known as forever chemicals: a man-made family of chemicals left unregulated for so long that they now permeate our environment and have found their way into our drinking water, food supply, and bodies, with devastating health and financial consequences.)

This approach means that when these laws fail to ensure needed environmental protections, impacted people generally have little recourse other than to protest or seek better candidates in the next political election, when it is often too late and irreparable damage has been done.

Moreover, this approach of “protection by statute” means that the burdens of environmental pollution—toxic air, contaminated water, and the growing impacts of the climate crisis—often fall most heavily on those whom the political process ignores. Historical and present-day inequities mean that the worst of these impacts are often concentrated in communities of color, Indigenous communities, and/or low-income communities. And the fact that even low levels of pollution disproportionately harm children, including those developing in utero, means that future generations often bear the brunt of this flawed system.

Not only is this approach—which places the burdens of environmental pollution on those it deliberately excludes from the political process—morally abhorrent; it is economically foolish. The near- and long-term effects of exposure to pollution makes us all more vulnerable to disease and economic hardship. Exposure to environmental contaminants causes a range of health harms that include asthma, heart disease, dementia, and cancers of all kinds. The cognitive effects of lead poisoning are perhaps best known, but polluted environments can have a myriad of lasting effects on a person’s learning abilities. The destruction of ecosystems around the country, as well as our climate more broadly, is subjecting our communities to the rising threat of floods, droughts, wildfires, disease, deadly heat, and more.

All of this costs us money through reduced human potential and economic activity, lost property values, resources required for emergency response services, disaster relief, and health care. At the same time, this environmental desecration deprives us of the emotional, physical, and psychological well-being that only time in nature can provide.

Environmental degradation also undermines our fundamental freedoms. Neurotoxins and other environmental contaminants undermine the right to a quality education, and the disproportionate impacts of water, air, and soil pollution undermine the right to equal treatment under the law. The right to fish, hunt, and trap found in many state constitutions is being stymied by the loss of healthy habitat and species decline caused by mistreatment of natural resources. The safety and sanctity of our homes, and the property rights to which we are constitutionally entitled, are undermined when pollution crosses property or state lines or climate change-fueled disasters destroy our towns and cities. And the health impacts of outdoor air pollution, including asthma attacks or heart conditions, limit our other fundamental rights.

As former Pennsylvania state Sen. Franklin Kury famously said, “Freedom of speech will be meaningless if we suffocate on polluted air.”

Constitutional Green Amendments transform this legal paradigm, adding overarching protections that explicitly empower our people and our government to more effectively protect the environment, while proactively preventing its degradation.

Green Amendments, as I have defined them, are constitutional amendments added to the Bill of Rights section of our state constitutions, which recognize and protect the inalienable rights of all people, including future generations, to pure water, clean air, a safe climate, and healthy environments. By virtue of their placement in these Bills of Rights (called a Declaration of Rights in some states) and their carefully crafted language, Green Amendments put environmental rights on an equal constitutional footing with other civil, human, and political rights.

As with these other fundamental freedoms, Green Amendments require all government officials within a state—elected, appointed, and regulatory, as well as those working at the state, county, or local level—to affirmatively consider environmental rights and prioritize their protection in all decision-making. Green Amendments further require that environmental rights be protected equitably for all communities, regardless of race, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status. And they require that natural resources be protected generationally, helping to ensure that future generations have the healthy environment they need to lead safe and prosperous lives.

Green Amendments empower people to raise their expectations of government and to advocate more firmly and confidently for environmental protection. When there is a legal gap in environmental protection or implementation that results in dangerous environmental harm, these amendments provide explicit constitutional language that can be relied upon to secure needed protection. When government officials fail to fulfill their constitutional duty, or when the laws as written, interpreted, and applied fail to honor the environmental rights of the people or the obligation of the government to protect the state’s natural resources, Green Amendments provide a powerful tool to compel protection in court.

When it comes to the environment, states have a tremendous amount of authority. While the federal government can obligate states to provide a basic level of environmental protection, states have the authority to do more to protect their residents. Passing a constitutional obligation on all government officials within a state to protect environmental rights equitably and preserve natural resources for both present and future generations can secure a higher level of environmental care than that afforded by federal law. While a federal Green Amendment will ultimately be needed in order to ensure our Congress, president, federal judges and regulatory agencies honor and protect our environmental rights, state-level constitutional action is especially meaningful and accessible in the near term.

Currently, there are three states with constitutional Green Amendments in place: Pennsylvania, Montana, and New York. In Pennsylvania, the amendment was used to restore the authority of local governments to protect residential communities from industrial fracking operations and to restore the obligation of fossil fuel fracking operations to comply with environmental protection standards. In Montana, it was the presence of a Green Amendment that allowed 16 youth to successfully restore the right and obligation of government officials to consider the climate-changing implications of their decisions. New York’s amendment is only a few years old, but it is already being used by communities to secure protection of their air, water, and public natural open spaces. Across the board, these amendments are being used to advance and secure people’s rights to drinking water free from toxic contamination, open space and the immense benefit it has for their communities, ecosystems and wildlife that enrich their lives, and farmland that’s free from contaminants that can render crops and livestock unusable.

Moreover, Green Amendments are being used to rein in and mitigate serious consequences that stem from air pollution and are helping corral industries like oil and gas that inflict devastating consequences on our people and environment. At the same time, these amendments provide powerful support to environmentally friendly industries, such as wind and solar, and can boost ecologically supportive development that provides jobs and bolsters economic prosperity.

Recognizing the need for transformational change when it comes to environmental protection, and inspired by the progress Green Amendments can and do achieve, over 20 additional states are working with Green Amendments for the Generations, the nonprofit I founded, to secure the powerful protections these Amendments offer.

The Green Amendment movement is a solution whose time has come, and it’s one that transcends political party, generation, race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status.

In a moment when many are disillusioned by U.S. politics and our government’s inability to achieve essential environmental protections, the Green Amendment movement is leveraging the most powerful tools our democracy has—our state and federal constitutions—to secure environmental rights, environmental justice, natural resources protection, and generational security. By passing Green Amendments in every state, we can make sure that our environment, our health, and our lives are protected for generations to come.",https://atmos.earth/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ATMOS12_A-Green-Amendment-for-Every-State_SilvanaTrevale_05_hor-1280x720.jpg,N,,2025-11-29 04:57:27.645356

In an effort to improve and prioritise energy efficiency while also reducing costs and emissions, Google is introducing its self-service Energy Assessment Tool (EAT). The platform is engineered to give facility managers the ability to perform preliminary energy assessments without requiring specialist expertise or incurring on-site expenses.

Many manufacturers could achieve substantial cost savings and emissions reductions through energy efficiency improvements, yet they often face barriers. These can include the high cost of engaging energy assessment consultants, limited capital for efficiency projects, and a lack of in-house energy management expertise.

Such challenges frequently prevent the implementation of simple high-impact projects. The EAT aims to break down these obstacles.

Accelerating climate action and cost reduction

To help overcome these challenges, EAT is offered as a free platform for manufacturing facility and plant managers. It is designed to identify energy-saving opportunities and accelerate progress toward both cost reductions and climate action.

The tool provides actionable insights without the need for deep energy management knowledge or expensive on-site assessments.

By inputting basic facility data, users can receive customised recommendations that cover more than 20 system areas, including air compressors, boilers, chillers, and lighting.

“We’re launching a tool that I wish I had access to early in my career as a sustainability leader,"" explains Kate Brandt, Chief Sustainability Officer at Google, on LinkedIn.

“By equipping our partners with the right resources we can accelerate progress reduce costs and build a more efficient and resilient supply chain for everyone.”

To support its adoption across key manufacturing regions, the tool is available in several languages, including Chinese (simplified and traditional), Thai, Vietnamese, and English. Individual supplier energy assessment data is kept secure and confidential.

The EAT is built and managed by a third party and has been reviewed by Google to ensure it meets stringent privacy and security standards. This allows suppliers to decide which partners to collaborate with and what summary data to share, such as total potential savings.

Wider sustainable energy goals

The tool is part of Google's broader strategy to integrate sustainable energy use across its operations and supply chain with a focus on energy, the circular economy, consumer hardware, water and nature.

As a large corporate buyer of clean energy, Google procures substantial volumes of renewable power while also investing in advanced nuclear, enhanced geothermal, and grid-enhancing technologies to support future innovation.

In 2020, Google launched its third decade of climate action, which included a target to reach net-zero emissions across its operations and value chain by 2030. This is supported by an ambition to run entirely on 24/7 carbon-free energy on every grid where Google operates.

Google also works to design out waste and increase material reuse in its data centres, which are among the most efficient in the world.

Taxpayers will foot the bills for the environmental, economic, and health costs from Ohio’s refusal to embrace the real clean, green renewable energy sources: solar and wind.","Dear Editor,

Unlike our neighboring states of Michigan and Illinois, Ohio’s politicians have not embraced the economic and environmental benefits that solar and wind energy provide. Instead, Ohio’s politicians passed Senate Bill 52, where communities can effectively block solar and wind projects, something that communities cannot do when it comes to fossil fuel development.

Ohio’s energy bill HB15, which passed in May of this year, was stripped of several pro-solar provisions, including a community solar program. This program would have helped poor communities access solar energy.

During the past nine months, the Trump administration has mounted a blatant attack on renewable energy by rolling back environmental laws and policies favoring renewables, canceling incentives enacted in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, and halting projects even when in construction.

Just when you think you’ve heard it all, Ohio’s Republican politicians have yet again come up with another way to kill renewable energy projects and promote the non-renewable fossil fuel gas: methane. HB 294 would grant “clean energy status” to methane gas.

This could mean gas projects might get preferential treatment over true renewable energy projects when it comes to permits by the Ohio Power Siting Board.

Unlike solar and wind energy, methane is a climate changing gas itself, and when burned produces carbon dioxide, another climate changing gas. “Sen. George Lang, one of the Republican co-sponsors, said in committee that natural gas is a cleaner energy source than coal.” That’s not saying much. Sen. Mark Romanchuk, a Richland County Republican and co-sponsor, remarked that building the infrastructure needed for solar- and wind-produced emissions, but he conveniently failed to mention the emissions created to construct a well pad and all the infrastructure needed to support the process.

According to a report by the World Nuclear Association, comparison of life-cycle CO2 emissions from all energy sources shows that fracked gas produces the third highest amount of CO2 with 490 grams of CO2 per kW hr. Utility scale solar produces 48 grams, residential solar produces 41 and wind are the lowest life-cycle emitters at 11 grams per kW hr. The life-cycle emissions from fracked gas include those produced from the extraction process which includes the gas (drilling), well pad and road construction, petrochemicals used to frack, compression and transportation of gas to LNG facilities and export transportation out of the country.

Additionally, the fracking process also requires enormous amounts of water and produces millions of gallons or toxic radioactive brine. Harrison County saw 853 million gallons of surface water withdrawn for fracking in 2023. That represents 78% of the total water usage in the county. Wind and solar energy have a significantly lower carbon and water footprint. Calling fracked gas “clean” is laughable.

At the same time politicians are wanting to declare “fracked” gas clean, they are working on legislation (HB 170 and SB 136) to give the Ohio Department of Natural Resources primacy over carbon dioxide capture and sequestration Class VI wells.

If passed, millions of tons of carbon emissions will be injected underneath Ohio land.

Taxpayers will be paying the tax incentives of $85 per ton of industrial CO2 captured and stored, according to the One Big Beautiful Bill.

Both HB 170 and SB 136 tramp on private property rights by allowing “forced pooling,” which means that land owners could be forced into allowing the injection of carbon dioxide under their private property.

The next assault on property owners may be the construction of pipelines to carry carbon dioxide across the state from industrial facilities to the injection wells; planned for Carroll, Jefferson, and Harrison counties. Mid-western states have already seen significant pushbacks from land owners who are being forced to allow pipelines to cross their farms and communities via the use of eminent domain.

Iowa residents have been fighting Summit Carbon Solutions’ pipeline for several years. In addition, Summit Carbon Solutions’ planned route through South Dakota to North Dakota has been blocked as the company was banned from using eminent domain to take property.

Will Ohio’s citizens be dealing with this legal battle as Ohio politicians invite the CCS industry into the state?

Recently, S. 2975, the federal “PIPELINE Safety Act of 2025,” passed by voice vote. It is a bipartisan effort to reauthorize the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration’s safety programs until 2030. This law would also set regulations for carbon dioxide pipelines. Environmental groups worry that the industry has had too much influence and point out the deficiencies that could lead to another accident like the one that occurred in 2020 in Satartia, Mississippi, where 45 people were overcome by CO2 leaking from a ruptured pipeline. These concerns included: lack of odorization of CO2 so releases are detectable by smell; performance-based leak detection and rupture mitigation; contaminant controls to help prevent CO2 related corrosion; and prevention of the conversion of oil or gas pipelines to CO2 pipelines.

Taxpayers will foot the bills for the environmental, economic, and health costs from Ohio’s refusal to embrace the real clean, green renewable energy sources: solar and wind.

The U.S. Energy Association has said, “Wind and solar power are two of the fastest-growing energy sectors in the U.S. and produced as much as 17% of the country’s electricity last year.” Yet, Ohio politicians continue to push “dirty” fracked gas down our throats.

They are either willfully ignorant or out of touch with reality.

T1 Energy Investment Narrative Recap

For T1 Energy shareholders, the big picture is a belief in the continuing growth of U.S. energy demand, strong policy support, and the company’s ability to secure financing for rapid solar manufacturing expansion. The recent US$202 million shelf registration filings and high-level government engagement may improve capital access and reinforce the policy tailwinds critical to upcoming catalysts, such as the launch of the G2_Austin solar cell facility. However, this news does not materially offset the biggest near-term risk, timely project funding and working capital execution. Among recent company announcements, the partnership agreement with Corning Inc. stands out as directly relevant to the ongoing ramp-up of solar cell production capacity. Access to hyper-pure polysilicon and wafers supports T1 Energy’s ambitions for FEOC-compliant, U.S.-based supply chains and enhances the likelihood of meeting future production and compliance targets, key points underpinning both growth catalysts and risk management related to tax credit eligibility.

The United States electric commercial vehicle (ECV) market was valued at USD 13.88 Billion in 2024, and is expected to reach USD 55.92 Billion by 2030, rising at a CAGR of 26.41%. The market is experiencing robust growth due to rising environmental concerns, stringent emission regulations, and the growing adoption of clean energy solutions.

Businesses are prioritizing sustainability, driving the demand for ECVs across logistics, delivery, and public transportation sectors. Government incentives and subsidies, including tax credits for purchasing electric vehicles, have further propelled market expansion. According to the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), there were over 12,000 electric medium- and heavy-duty vehicles operating in the U.S. as of Q4 2023. This includes delivery vans, trucks, and buses, reflecting a nearly 35% increase year-over-year in deployment.

The development of advanced battery technologies has enhanced vehicle efficiency and reduced operating costs, making ECVs increasingly attractive for commercial applications. The growing awareness of corporate social responsibility among companies encourages investments in cleaner fleet options. Key trends in the market include advancements in battery technology, such as solid-state batteries offering greater energy density and faster charging times.

The integration of smart connectivity features, including telematics and vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication, is transforming fleet management and optimizing operational efficiency. Emerging technologies, such as hydrogen fuel cells, are also gaining traction, especially for long-haul commercial applications. The shift toward autonomous electric vehicles is creating opportunities for cost reduction and enhanced safety in logistics operations. Collaborations between automotive manufacturers and technology firms are accelerating innovation, while fleet electrification strategies by major logistics companies are bolstering market growth.

Market drivers

Government incentives and regulations

The United States has implemented a series of policies to accelerate the adoption of ECVs. Incentives such as tax credits, grants, and rebates for fleet operators and vehicle manufacturers reduce the upfront cost of adopting ECVs. Stringent emissions regulations encourage a shift away from internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles.

The California Air Resources Board (CARB) and federal initiatives like the Zero-Emission Vehicle (ZEV) program mandate fleet electrification, making ECVs essential for regulatory compliance. These measures provide a stable demand for ECVs, particularly among logistics and public transportation operators seeking sustainable and regulatory-compliant solutions. For instance, in 2023 leasing models allowed electric cars to qualify for relaxed commercial vehicle tax credits. Savings were passed to leaseholders, boosting EV adoption. This strategy supported sustained rollouts.

Key market challenges

High upfront costs

The initial cost of electric commercial vehicles remains a barrier despite declining battery prices. ECVs are generally more expensive than their ICE counterparts due to the cost of advanced batteries and associated technologies. Fleet operators often face budget constraints that make the transition to ECVs challenging, particularly for small businesses.

Even with incentives, the total cost of ownership (TCO) calculation, factoring in charging infrastructure and maintenance, can deter adoption. Addressing these financial barriers requires scalable production and economies of scale to further reduce manufacturing costs.

Key market trends

Adoption of electric delivery vans and trucks

The increasing focus on last-mile delivery efficiency is driving the adoption of electric delivery vans and trucks. Companies in the logistics and retail sectors are prioritizing these vehicles for urban deliveries to reduce emissions and operational costs.

According to the North American Council for Freight Efficiency (NACFE), electric delivery vans used by fleets such as FedEx and UPS demonstrated 30% to 50% lower total cost of ownership (TCO) compared to internal combustion vehicles in urban use cases.

“Carney’s deal with Danielle Smith is the sellout of the century: scrapping climate legislation for a pipeline that will never be built,” said Lewis, a veteran journalist and climate activist.
“Despite this difficult economic context, I remain one of those for whom environmental issues must remain front and center,” Guilbeault said in a statement.
“Over the past few months, several elements of the climate action plan I worked on as Minister of the Environment have been, or are about to be, dismantled,” he said.
“The pipeline to BC would have to cross some of the most challenging terrain in Canada.","First Nations groups backed by environmental and conservationist allies in Canada are denouncing a pipeline and tanker infrastructure agreement announced Thursday between Liberal Prime Minister Mark Carney and Conservative Alberta Premier Danielle Smith, calling the deal a betrayal and promising to fight against its implementation tooth and nail.

“We will use every tool in our toolbox to ensure that this pipeline does not go ahead,” said Heiltsuk Nation Chief Marilyn Slett in response to the Carney-Smith deal that would bring tens of millions of barrels of tar sands oil from Alberta to the coast of British Columbia for export by building new pipeline and lifting a moratorium against oil tankers operating in fragile British Columbia coastal water.

While Carney, who argues that the pipeline is in Canada’s economic interest, had vowed to secure the support of First Nations before finalizing any agreement with the Alberta, furious reactions to the deal made it clear that promise was not met.

Xhaaidlagha Gwaayaai, the president of the Haida nation, was emphatic: “This project is not going to happen.”

The agreement, according to the New York Times, is part of Carney’s “plan to curb Canada’s trade dependence on the United States, swings Canadian policy away from measures meant to fight climate change to focus instead on growing the oil and gas industry.”

In a statement, the Union of British Columbia Indian Chiefs (UBCIC) “loudly” voiced its opposition to the memorandum of understanding signed by Carney and Smith.

“This MOU is nothing less than a high risk and deeply irresponsible agreement that sacrifices Indigenous peoples, coastal communities, and the environment for political convenience,” said Grand Chief Stewart Phillip, president of the UBCIC. “By explicitly endorsing a new bitumen pipeline to BC’s coast and promising to rewrite the Oil Tanker Moratorium Act, the federal government is resurrecting one of the most deeply flawed and divisive ideas in Canadian energy politics.”

Slett, who serves as secretary-treasurer of the UBCIC, said the agreement “was negotiated without the involvement of the very Nations who would shoulder those risks, and to suggest ‘Indigenous co-ownership’ of a pipeline while ignoring the clear opposition of Coastal First Nations is unacceptable.”

Avi Lewis, running for the leadership of the progressive New Democratic Party (NDP) in upcoming elections, decried the agreement as a failure of historic proportions.

“Carney’s deal with Danielle Smith is the sellout of the century: scrapping climate legislation for a pipeline that will never be built,” said Lewis, a veteran journalist and climate activist. “We need power lines, not pipelines. Our path is through climate leadership and building good jobs in the clean economy.”

In response to the deal, the minister of Canadian culture, Steven Guilbeault, who formerly served as environment minister under the previous Liberal administration, resigned in protest.

“Despite this difficult economic context, I remain one of those for whom environmental issues must remain front and center,” Guilbeault said in a statement.

“Over the past few months, several elements of the climate action plan I worked on as Minister of the Environment have been, or are about to be, dismantled,” he said. “In my view, these measures remain essential to our climate action plan.”

David Eby, the premier of British Columbia who opposes the new pipeline into his province and was not included in the discussions between Carney and Smith, echoed those who said the project is more dead than alive, despite the MOU, calling it a potential “energy vampire” that would distracts from better energy solutions that don’t carry all the baggage of this proposed project.

“With all of the variables that have yet to be fulfilled — no proponent, no route, no money, no First Nations support — that it cannot draw limited federal resources, limited Indigenous governance resources, limited provincial resources away from the real projects that will employ people,” Eby added.

Keith Brooks, the programs director at Environmental Defence, decried the deal as “worse than we had anticipated” and “a gift to the oil industry and Alberta Premier Smith, at the expense of practically everyone else.”

“Filling this pipeline and expansion would require more oil sands mining, leading to more carbon pollution, more tailings, and worse impacts for communities near the tar sands,” warned Brooks. “The pipeline to BC would have to cross some of the most challenging terrain in Canada. The impacts of construction would be severe, and the impacts of a spill, devastating.”

Jessica Green, a professor at the University of Toronto with a focus on environmental politics, equated the “reckless” deal to a “climate dumpster fire” and called the push for more tar sands pipelines in Canada “the energy equivalent [of] investing in VHS tapes in 2025.”",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2248007232-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-11-29 12:02:42.880368

The DOE had requested proposals Oct. 21 of suppliers interested in selling 1 million barrels of sour crude oil produced in the United States for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. The petroleum would be provided to one of the DOE’s SPR sites.

The U.S. government has oil reserves in large underground salt caverns at four sites along the Gulf coast: two each in Texas and Louisiana. President Gerald Ford established the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in 1975 to shield the U.S. from oil shortages in an energy crisis.

The DOE announced winning suppliers on Nov. 12 for both contracts totaling $55.7 million. Deliveries are to start from Dec. 1 through Jan. 31 at the Bryan Mound SPR in Texas. The agency stated that six companies submitted 18 offers to supply the crude oil.

“President Trump promised to protect America’s energy security by refilling and managing the Strategic Petroleum Reserve more responsibly,” U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright, noted in a press statement. “Awarding these contracts marks another step in the important process of refilling this national security asset. While this process won’t be complete overnight, these actions are an important step in strengthening our energy security and reversing the costly and irresponsible energy policies of the last administration.”

The largest contract (for some 600 million barrels) went to Trafigura Trading LLC (a wholly-owned subsidiary of Trafigura Group Pte Ltd). The other DOE contract was signed for 300 million barrels with Energy Transfer Crude Marketing LLC.

With a combined authorized storage capacity of 714 million barrels, the SPRs consist of the:

Bryan Mound—in Brazoria County, 65 miles south of Houston,

Big Hill—in Jefferson County, 26 miles southwest of Beaumont, Texas,

West Hockberry—in Cameron Parish, 25 miles southwest of Lake Charles, La., and

Bayou Choctaw—in Iberville Parish, 12 miles southwest of Baton Rouge, La.

“Decisions to withdraw crude oil in the event of an energy emergency are made by the President under the authority of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act and done through a competitive sale. The SPR is always drawdown-ready, which means it stands ready to release crude oil to the market within 13 days of Presidential direction; this is the time it takes to conduct the sales process, award contracts and to arrange the logistics for oil transportation,” according to DOE.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/692a624bc926253a1cf05745/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-11-28 22:58:13.849635

Automatic charging interruption under abnormal conditions

Durability testing for long-term high-load operation

With safety concerns increasingly discussed among EV owners, EVDANCE’s emphasis on transparent certification is aligned with broader 2025 consumer expectations.

EVDANCE 2025 Charger Lineup: Three Models for Different Home Setups

12A Level 1 Charger — Universal Compatibility with Standard Outlets

EVDANCE’s 12A Level 1 charger uses the common NEMA 5-15 household outlet, making it ideal for EV owners living in apartments, older homes, or rental properties. It requires no electrician, provides overnight charging, and is available in both NACS (Tesla-compatible) and J1772 versions. Despite being the entry-level option, it meets full UL2594 and ETL requirements for daily home use.

24A Level 2 Charger — Faster Charging Using Existing Dryer Outlets

The 24A portable Level 2 charger is designed for homeowners seeking faster charging without installing a dedicated EV charging station. Supporting both NEMA 14-30 and NEMA 10-30 outlets, the charger is compatible with most dryer connections found in U.S. households. It delivers up to 5.76 kW, adding approximately 20–25 miles of range per hour, and is available for both Tesla NACS and J1772-equipped vehicles.

40A Level 2 Smart Charger — High Power with Full App Control

EVDANCE’s flagship 40A charger connects via a NEMA 14-50 outlet and delivers up to 9.6 kW, providing one of the fastest home charging experiences in its class. A built-in smart app allows users to monitor charging status, schedule sessions for off-peak hours, track energy usage, and review charging history. The unit features an IP66 water-resistant design and a 25-foot cable, offering durability and flexibility for indoor and outdoor use.

After conducting surveys across the city with a special focus on the west side, which disproportionately experiences the effects of pollution, the city found that Salt Lakers’ top environmental concerns are drought and air quality.
Salt Lake City is in the top three metro areas in the country for urban heat island intensity, with the west side of the city feeling those effects more strongly, Wyffels said.
Seasons in Salt Lake City are getting hotter, Nicholas said.
Utah has also criticized the federal air quality regulations, even disputing Environmental Protection Agency air quality rules in court.","While the federal government steps away from climate agreements, Salt Lake City is reiterating its commitment to become more sustainable ahead of the 2034 Olympic Games with a 2040 deadline to achieve goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution.

In an update presented to the Salt Lake City Council on Tuesday, the city’s Sustainability Department highlighted milestones, including a major one — the city’s greenhouse gas emissions fell 11% from 2009 to 2024, said Catherine Wyffels, air quality and environmental program manager at the department.

“This is primarily due to a shift to cleaner energy sources,” Wyffels said in a presentation. “So while this 11% may not seem like much, it’s important to remember that it happened during a period of a lot of growth.”

Per capita emissions also declined 25% in the same period, she said. But there’s still a long way to go to meet the city’s climate goals.

After conducting surveys across the city with a special focus on the west side, which disproportionately experiences the effects of pollution, the city found that Salt Lakers’ top environmental concerns are drought and air quality.

“People are interested in anything they can do in their homes to save under utility bills,” she said. “A lot of support for clean renewable energy for both homes and businesses. People like street trees in their neighborhoods, and then also a lot of support for increased access to transit, walking and biking infrastructure.”

All of those are solutions to the city’s primary climate risks, which according to the Sustainability Department, are driven by rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns.

The report presented to the City Council is still preliminary and is scheduled for an update next spring. Whenever it’s done, the city hopes it can help trace a path to achieve its goal to be 100% powered by renewable energy by 2030 and cutting 80% of emissions by 2040.

Salt Lake City is in the top three metro areas in the country for urban heat island intensity, with the west side of the city feeling those effects more strongly, Wyffels said. Urban development amid continued growth is expected to exacerbate the issue.

The city’s sustainability department also highlighted some achievements including an 80-megawatt solar farm that provides a lot of the city’s municipal energy and has saved around $1.5 million in electricity bills, said Sophia Nicholas, deputy director at the city’s Sustainability Department.

“We have a lot of the solutions at hand. We just need to have the wherewithal, political will, money, to implement them on a global basis,” Nicholas said. “And it is happening actually in other countries, but when you’re looking at our emissions profile in Salt Lake City in particular, about half of it comes from electricity, and that’s why it’s been so exciting to see that we have realized a reduction in our electric grid carbon intensity due to investments in a cleaner grid.”

Despite the progress there are still some issues. Seasons in Salt Lake City are getting hotter, Nicholas said. In the last 50 years, the average temperature in Utah has risen more than 2.5 degrees Fahrenheit, about twice the global average.

“That may not sound like much,” she said during the meeting, “but a few degrees change in the average temperature means our city and our region is and will continue to experience increasing drought, wildfires, flooding, extreme heat days and poor air quality.”

The city met federal air quality standards

For 15 years Salt Lake City and Provo, some of the densest cities in Utah were nonattainment areas for the Environmental Protection Agency’s 24-hour standards for fine particular matter pollution known as PM2.5. This month, however, the federal agency announced both municipalities were finally in compliance.

“The achievement of cleaner air in Utah resulted from extensive planning and collaboration among the public, industry, and various government levels, leading to significant investments and the implementation of 23 new rules targeting emissions from multiple sources,” Bryce Bird, director at the Utah Division of Air Quality, said in a statement.

He pointed to some efforts supported by the state Legislature, including incentives for retrofitting and replacing high-emission wood stoves and diesel vehicles, as well as transit updates and education campaigns.

However, in terms of energy, the state also modified its policy in 2024 to consider energy resources by listing these attributes in order of priority: adequate, reliable, dispatchable, affordable, sustainable, secure and clean. That law worried environmentalists, who said it could lead to the prioritization of coal and move the state away from a strong market of renewables.

Utah has also criticized the federal air quality regulations, even disputing Environmental Protection Agency air quality rules in court.",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/120624_Air-Quality_05-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2025-11-29 00:58:23.083099

And our two freeports, in Anglesey and South Wales, are helping to attract investment with tax incentives, streamlined customs processes and sites ready for development.
In all, Wales is home to more than 5,000 manufacturing companies, with a workforce of over 150,000 people.
Since 2019, AMRC Cymru in North Wales – part of the University of Sheffield’s Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre – has been harnessing world-leading research to transform how the industry works.
South Wales is soon to have a new innovation hub of its own.","Wales is a nation built on enterprise and innovation. Our coal mines once fuelled the Industrial Revolution, and Welsh smelting works produced more copper than anywhere else on earth. Slate from our quarries roofed the world, from New York to New South Wales.

In the 20th century, manufacturing and heavy industry shared the stage with new forms of enterprise. Wales became known for precision engineering and high-tech electronics, welcoming some of the biggest corporations from Europe, America and the Far East.

Today, Wales has become a unique business environment where collaboration drives success. Our high-growth industries enjoy close partnership with eight world-class universities, and the support of a devolved government that can make things happen at speed.

What’s more, Wales was the first nation to pass legislation protecting the rights of future generations. Sustainability is at the heart of all our priority sectors, including renewable energy, life sciences, compound semiconductors, technology, advanced manufacturing and the creative industries.

It’s quite a journey from the furnaces of our copperworks to the spotlessly clean rooms where the world’s most advanced semiconductors are made. But however much our industries change, the fundamentals are the same: Wales is a place where talent thrives, and ideas can take flight.

Coal powered our past, but our future lies in renewable energy – from the wind, from the waves, and from cleanly generated hydrogen. Just as Wales once sent its anthracite around the world, we’re now a net exporter of electricity.

Our 1,200km coastline is ideal for offshore wind generation, with three sites already operational. By 2030, wind will power four million households, creating 29,000 jobs and a £4.5billion economic impact.

We’ve developed the infrastructure to help energy innovators harness our abundant natural resources. Our marine test zones are valuable proving grounds for technologies that could help meet the world’s future energy needs, such as tidal power. And our two freeports, in Anglesey and South Wales, are helping to attract investment with tax incentives, streamlined customs processes and sites ready for development.

Compound semiconductors are vital to artificial intelligence, self-driving vehicles, advanced medical devices – even the smartphone in your pocket.

Many of the chips are developed and manufactured in Wales, a nation with 40 years of semiconductor expertise. We’re home to the world’s first compound semiconductor cluster: a tight ecosystem of tech companies and specialist research centres, collaborating under the name of CSconnected.

Its capabilities make Wales a semiconductor one-stop shop, with businesses that span the entire supply chain – from wafer production and chip processing to equipment manufacturing and packaging, all in a concentrated area of South East Wales.

Our approach attracts top global players. In 2025, KLA opened a new 237,000 square foot R&D and manufacturing facility in Newport, supplying chip fabrication equipment to the world. Just five miles away, Vishay operates the UK’s largest semiconductor manufacturing plant.

Life sciences is the umbrella term for the study of living organisms and processes – and the use of this knowledge to improve people's lives.

More than 300 life sciences companies are tackling today’s healthcare challenges in Wales. They represent a vast range of specialisms, from genomics and advanced diagnostics to medical imaging – but all of them benefit from industry networks that tie the sector together.

For 30 years, MediWales has served as an independent life science network for Wales, connecting universities, businesses, care providers and the clinical community. Life Sciences Hub Wales, based in Cardiff, is another beacon of cross-sector co-operation, helping to develop the most promising breakthroughs for frontline use.

The Welsh Government is a vital spoke in our ecosystem, with national programmes in genomics, pathology, imaging and advanced therapies. Wales also has its own devolved National Health Service, granting access to high-quality anonymised healthcare data.

All this has earned Wales a global reputation in fast-moving markets such as medtech, diagnostics, regenerative medicine and cell therapy. It’s now a sector worth £2.8 billion, employing a skilled workforce of 13,000 people.

Wales has one of the fastest-growing digital economies outside London. Our tech sector is worth an estimated £8.5 billion, providing jobs for around 13,000 people. From challenger banks to cybersecurity innovators, it’s a dynamic, collaborative ecosystem.

Our universities are key partners, providing research and development capability, generating spin-out companies, and producing graduates with the skills to keep the sector growing.

More than 30 incubators and accelerators transform ideas into thriving businesses. They include Tramshed Tech, which provides start-ups with flexible workspaces, mentoring and digital skills. The networking community FinTech Wales connects new businesses with both expertise and investment.

Indeed, FinTech is particularly strong in Wales – partly thanks to a buoyant financial services sector that employs more than 63,000 people. We’re a global leader in cybersecurity, too, with active North and South Wales cyber clusters and more than 150 companies developing the capabilities to protect critical computer systems.

Wales manufactures for the world. We export aircraft wings to France, cable systems to Japan, air conditioning units to the Middle East, and many more advanced products and components destined for markets around the globe.

In all, Wales is home to more than 5,000 manufacturing companies, with a workforce of over 150,000 people. Key subsectors include aerospace, automotive, precision engineering and robotics.

While manufacturing is anchored in our industrial heritage, it’s among our most forward-looking sectors. Since 2019, AMRC Cymru in North Wales – part of the University of Sheffield’s Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre – has been harnessing world-leading research to transform how the industry works.

South Wales is soon to have a new innovation hub of its own. The Global Centre of Rail Excellence will research and test out the technologies to build tomorrow’s railway networks – making transport better, faster and more sustainable throughout the UK and Europe.

Wales has graced the screen in international hits ranging from Doctor Who and Sherlock to His Dark Materials and Sex Education. Behind the camera, our film and TV industry is thriving, with world-class facilities to match our beautiful locations.

More than 90,000 people work in the creative industries, producing an annual turnover of £3.8 billion. They’re supported by Creative Wales, established by the Welsh Government to drive growth in film, TV, music, gaming and digital arts.

Our production facilities, such as Wolf Studios in Cardiff, can accommodate the greatest feats of imagination. They’re served by a constellation of specialists, dealing with everything from lighting hire to set design, post-production and VFX. And digital arts are booming, with games from independent developers like Wales Interactive entertaining millions around the world.",https://www.wales.com/sites/wales/files/styles/o_herostandard_fullwidth_xl_min_2x/public/media-library/2025-11/25893-n131-330-d-web-optimised-1920px.jpg.webp?itok=6w2CC8DS,N,,2025-11-29 05:58:36.860008

Three points of concerns included “unprecedented staffing crisis,” the Congressional Review Act (CRA) and proposed land sales.
The staffing crisis that BLM faces under the Trump administration was said to slows down planning and permitting processes.
“Senators also heard how the Bureau of Land Management is facing an unprecedented staffing crisis due to the Trump administration’s cuts,” Hamby said.
“Congress needs to step up on behalf of our public lands and ensure BLM has the people and funding to do its job and steward these lands for future generations,” Hamby said.","On Nov. 19, a recent Senate hearing regarding the multiple-use mandate of America’s public lands was held by the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. The core issue discussed was about the challenge of balancing the “multiple-use” mandate (which requires balancing recreation, conservation, timber, grazing, and energy development) with a “sustained yield.”

Many senators and witnesses expressed frustration with the current process, calling it “rigid, slow, and often detached from the intent Congress expressed” and subject to political shifts between administrations.

“Senators heard one consistent message today: Multiple use is hard,” Rachael Hamby, policy director at The Center for Western Priorities, said. “Finding the balance happens on the ground, with the residents, scientists, and small business owners who know the land the best. That’s why it’s so foolish for Congress to use a blunt instrument like the Congressional Review Act to impose land management decisions from Washington.

“Senators also heard how the Bureau of Land Management is facing an unprecedented staffing crisis due to the Trump administration’s cuts,” Hamby said.

Recent use of the CRA by Congress to overturn three specific resource management plans was noted as potentially causing “chaos” and uncertainty in land management, as it calls into question the validity of numerous other land use plans and decisions. Some Republican senators, including Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah), have proposed selling off millions of acres of public land to address housing shortages and national debt, a measure that has faced significant opposition.

This substantial government investment underscores the strategic importance of developing domestic rare earth processing capabilities outside Chinese control.

The company has also taken steps to secure feedstock and expand partnerships, which are critical in the rare-earth arena where refining capacity—not just mining—is the choke point. By manufacturing in Louisiana, sourcing from allied feed-stock jurisdictions and avoiding reliance on Chinese equipment and supply chains, the company aligns with the West’s push for resilience in critical minerals. This approach addresses the fundamental vulnerability in Western supply chains that has become increasingly apparent as China asserts greater control over rare earth exports.

Ucore’s broader corporate strategy includes disrupting the People’s Republic of China’s control of the North American REE supply chain through the near-term development of a heavy and light rare-earth processing facility in Louisiana, with subsequent strategic metals complexes planned for Canada and Alaska. The company maintains additional information about its operations and strategic direction available through its corporate website at https://www.Ucore.com. Additional news and updates relating to the company are accessible through their newsroom at https://ibn.fm/UURAF.

The timing of Ucore’s expansion coincides with growing geopolitical tensions and increasing recognition among Western governments that rare earth elements—essential for defense technologies, electric vehicles, and renewable energy systems—represent a critical national security vulnerability when concentrated in a single supplier nation. The Department of Defense funding signals both the urgency and strategic priority placed on developing alternative supply chains for these essential materials.",https://www.citybuzz.co/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/favicon-65x65.png,N,,2025-11-29 15:00:33.054695

Indonesia: nickel dominance, battery dream Indonesia has leveraged its dominant nickel reserves to pull in major EV battery investments.
This dependency introduces substantial strategic risk.
Opportunities to capture semiconductor back-end work, EV battery manufacturing and higher-value electronics are real.","(MENAFN- Asia Times) ASEAN is attempting to secure a foothold in the global semiconductor and electric-vehicle battery industries. Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand have each announced concrete industrial commitments that signal an ambition to move deeper into high-value manufacturing.

These efforts carry strategic implications because semiconductors, power electronics and batteries are essential inputs for artificial intelligence, renewable energy systems and modern defense industries. The region now faces a growing set of geopolitical and engineering pressures that directly affect planned projects, cost structures and national industrial strategies.

This analysis documents the most significant national developments in 2024 and 2025, outlines precise vulnerabilities and provides realistic mitigation measures for decision makers.

Strategic context

In October 2025 China announced additional controls on rare-earth exports and related processing technologies. This decision briefly tightened the market for rare-earth magnets and separated oxides that are crucial for EV motors and semiconductor equipment. Although Beijing later delayed parts of the policy's implementation, the message was clear: Critical inputs can be restricted with little warnin.

Meanwhile, the United States and its allies have continued adjusting export controls on chipmaking equipment. Any further tightening will directly affect the cost and feasibility of new packaging and test facilities across ASEAN. The strategic environment surrounding high technology has therefore become volatile and has placed pressure on firms hoping to expand into advanced electronics production.

Malaysia: advanced packing ambitions

Malaysia is pursuing one of the most aggressive semiconductor-upgrade strategies in Southeast Asia. Penang's“Silicon Island” project and the new Green Tech Park represent a deliberate shift from assembly to higher-value packaging and design.

Approved semiconductor-related investments reportedly exceeded 70 billion ringgit ($17 billion) between January 2024 and June 2025. Investments include Infineon's silicon carbide expansion and Carsem's advanced packaging facilities for AI-related chips.

Advanced-packaging and testing lines in Malaysia's semiconductor clusters still depend on specialized lithography subsystems, ultra-high-purity precursor chemicals and precision metrology equipment.

These imports are increasingly vulnerable because Malaysia's new export-control regime now requires notifications for high-performance AI chips and equipment, creating possible bottlenecks and compliance burdens.

Latest stories A familiar quiet: Prabowo and the return of managed dissent New weapons emerging to counter and zap drone power South Korea's grand plan to join the AI big time

For example, Malaysia's July 202 directive requires exporters to notify authorities at least 30 days in advance when shipping US-origin high-performance AI chips, signaling that regulatory headwinds may also apply upstream in tool and component supply chains.

Without expedited import lanes, delays in receiving critical equipment would postpone factory commissioning in locations such as Penang, driving up capital costs through extended financing periods.

The Malaysian government must fast-track customs and import lanes for critical equipment, co-finance spare-parts pools for fabs and invest in infrastructure near semiconductor clusters such as high-quality water, power reliability and waste-treatment.

In parallel, public-private training centers should train large numbers of precision-manufacturing engineers.

Indonesia: nickel dominance, battery dream

Indonesia has leveraged its dominant nickel reserves to pull in major EV battery investments. The flagship project is the nearly $6 billion joint venture between Contemporary Amperex Technology Company (CATL) and Indonesia Battery Corporation in West Java.

A June 2025 Reuters report said the facility is scheduled to begin operations by late 2026 with an initial capacity of 6.9 GWh, with an expansion path toward 15 GWh or more. The scale demonstrates Indonesia's ambition to anchor the region's battery ecosystem, but it also highlights the limits of upstream advantage.

Despite controlling the raw material, Indonesia's battery value chain is not yet integrated. The CATL–IBC project will still depend heavily on imported precursor chemicals, cathode active materials and high-precision manufacturing equipment.

The Reuters report noted that while Indonesia has rapidly expanded nickel processing, the country has not built the full suite of midstream capabilities required for stable cell production. Critical reagents and machinery remain tied to suppliers in China, South Korea and Japan.

This dependency introduces substantial strategic risk. A February 2025 C4ADS repor found that Chinese companies control roughly 75% of Indonesia's nickel-refining capacity.

That concentration means that although production occurs on Indonesian soil, operational control, technology flows and strategic decisions often originate in external corporate or policy environments. Any shift in Chinese domestic policy, export priorities or commercial strategy could ripple through Indonesia's downstream battery plans and disrupt cell production timelines.

Given these vulnerabilities, Indonesia must accelerate development of domestic precursor and cathode-material facilities to reduce exposure to foreign suppliers. Battery-plant construction should also be sequenced with upgrades to grid capacity, wastewater management and environmental controls, since these engineering systems remain bottlenecks in several industrial zones.

Manufacturers should also design production lines with modularity so they can switch battery chemistries if global markets or reagent availability change.

Thailand: EV hub conversion

Thailand is moving quickly to convert its dominant automotive industry into an electric-vehicle hub. The Board of Investment's EV 3.5 package, announced in 2025, offers tax incentives, consumer subsidies and import-duty relief through 2027 for manufacturers that commit to local production.

This policy has already shifted investment patterns. BYD opened a $490 million plant in Rayong in mid-2025 with capacity for 150,000 EVs annually, marking one of the largest EV manufacturing commitments in Southeast Asia. Domestic EV registrations also surge to roughly 70,000 units in 2024, up from fewer than 10,000 in 2021.

Despite these gains, Thailand's EV ecosystem remains dependent on imported battery cells, semiconductor components and rare-earth magnets. ASEAN Briefing's September 2025 assessment found that Thailand still lacks mid-stream capabilities such as cathode production, electrolyte processing and advanced battery-testing facilities. This dependence exposes the sector to the same vulnerabilities faced by regional semiconductor clusters.

These components also move through logistics systems designed for traditional automotive supply chains. Laem Chabang Port remains optimized for bulk auto parts rather than high-value lithium-ion cells.

EV assemblers reported delays in 2025 due to congestion and manual customs checks on sensitive components during peak export periods. Even minor slowdowns disrupt just-in-time assembly and raise operational costs.

To protect its emerging EV advantage, Thailand must expand bonded logistics zones for battery components, accelerate port digitization and cooperate with ASEAN partners to harmonize battery standards. Without these measures, Thailand's EV ambitions will remain vulnerable to supply-chain friction and regulatory fragmentation.

Regional Risk Map

Material concentration risk. China's export controls on rare earths and magnets create leverage points. ASEAN must map critical-element dependencies and invest in regional recycling and stockpiles.

Equipment and technology risk. Restrictive export regimes on chip-making tools raise project execution risk. ASEAN governments should establish pooled spare-parts procurement, trusted procurement corridors and diplomatic waiver channels.

Infrastructure and skills risk. All three countries face co-investment needs in power, water, waste and vocational training aligned with advanced manufacturing. ASEAN-level funding mechanisms and mutual recognition of professional certifications would reduce friction. Sign up for one of our free newsletters

ASEAN stands at a pivotal moment. Opportunities to capture semiconductor back-end work, EV battery manufacturing and higher-value electronics are real. Malaysia's move into advanced packaging, Indonesia's downstream battery strategy and Thailand's EV pivot are promising.

They are also fragile. Each depends on imported tools, materials and specialized skills that can be disrupted by geopolitical shifts.

The region's success will depend on how quickly leaders can reduce those vulnerabilities through strategic infrastructure investment, targeted industrial policy, regional standardization and coordinated risk management.

Without these measures, factories across ASEAN will remain profitable in calm markets but exposed during periods of geopolitical tumult.

The two nations also agreed to co-host the first ever International Conference on the Just Transition Away from Fossil Fuels, scheduled for April 2026.
“There is a clear momentum to phase out fossil fuels, and now is the time to capitalise on it,” said Sophie Hermans, the Dutch minister for climate.
This is a major milestone.” Under the North Sea Future Plan, small amounts of fossil fuels will still be able to be extracted at or near existing wells.
Campaigners said that it will result in relatively small amounts of fossil fuels being extracted.","Nations hatched a plan to abandon fossil fuels

After the Cop30 climate summit concluded with zero mention of fossil fuels in the draft text, Colombia and the Netherlands pledged to establish their own roadmap for abandoning oil, gas and coal – with the backing of 22 other nations, including Australia and the UK.

While there was a lack of consensus on fossil fuels at Cop30 – a victory for obstructive petrostates – around a third of nations backed phasing them out. Colombia and the Netherlands were among them, and announced that they would independently establish a roadmap for abandoning fossil fuels. The two nations also agreed to co-host the first ever International Conference on the Just Transition Away from Fossil Fuels, scheduled for April 2026.

“There is a clear momentum to phase out fossil fuels, and now is the time to capitalise on it,” said Sophie Hermans, the Dutch minister for climate. “We must begin to materialise what this phaseout could look like and start a concrete roadmap that allows us to incorporate the new and leave the old behind.”

The breakaway conference comes as critics question whether the Cop process is fit for purpose, having struggled to enact significant change since the Paris agreement was signed at Cop21 in 2015.

Speaking of abandoning fossil fuels …

The UK has become the first major economy to call time on new fossil fuel exploration, confirming that no more licenses for oil and gas drilling will be issued in the North Sea.

“Britain has just made history,” said Greenpeace UK’s co-executive director, Areeba Hamid. “Closing the door to new exploration marks the beginning of the end of oil and gas in this country. The government has shown genuine global climate leadership. This is a major milestone.”

Under the North Sea Future Plan, small amounts of fossil fuels will still be able to be extracted at or near existing wells. The government argued that this would support the UK’s energy transition. Campaigners said that it will result in relatively small amounts of fossil fuels being extracted.

Despite welcoming the announcement, Hamid said that “the current plan – and cash – to support North Sea workers doesn’t go far enough”. She added: “It’s vital they are at the heart of Britain’s transition to a clean-energy superpower, not left behind by it. A £20m jobs package doesn’t cut the mustard.”

Monthly injection shown to relieve severe asthma

People who take daily steroid tablets for severe asthma could soon have a new treatment option after a new jab showed “incredibly encouraging” results in a trial.

For the trial, King’s recruited more than 300 people with severe asthma from 11 countries. Researchers found that 90% of participants who received a monthly tezepelumab injection were able to reduce or stop taking their daily steroid tablets, without any impact on their symptoms. Tezepelumab is an antibody which targets parts of the immune system, reducing lung inflammation.

Scientists are eager to find alternative treatments for managing severe asthma, as long-term daily steroid use can lead to serious health problems, including osteoporosis, diabetes, and increased vulnerability to infections.

“This is an incredibly encouraging development for the future of asthma care that could transform the lives of people with severe asthma,” said Dr Samantha Walker of the charity Asthma + Lung UK.

The study was funded by pharmaceutical companies AstraZeneca and Amgen. Further research is planned.

‘Caring businesses’ honoured at UK awards

Businesses that employ ex-offenders to work on environmental projects, train homelessness people to be baristas, and support Palestinian farmers were among the winners of this year’s UK Social Enterprise of the Year award, held on Wednesday.

The annual gong recognises the growing contribution that social enterprises make to the economy and wider society, and celebrates “Britain at its best”.

The Skill Mill was among the winners. It provides environmental jobs for young people involved in the criminal justice system. Other winners included Change Please, which helps lift people out of homelessness by training them to be baristas, and Zaytoun CIC, which supports Palestinian farmers producing food in the West Bank.

“Every year brings its challenges, but 2025 saw a difficult economic trading environment alongside a sometimes unsettling national conversation on what it means to be British which dominated the political landscape,” said Peter Holbrook, Social Enterprise UK’s chief exec. “It’s therefore truly heartening to celebrate businesses built on care and compassion that support the most vulnerable members of our communities, representing Britain at its best.”

Crop yields soar thanks to solar panels – study

Solar farms and agriculture are often billed as rivals when it comes to land use. A new study supports a growing consensus that the opposite is true.

Canadian researchers found that partial shading provided by agrivoltaic systems – solar arrays with crops growing under them – can boost food production, while improving soil health and encouraging nutrient cycling. The benefits increase when the panels are not in use, the study found, meaning decommissioned solar farms could still provide an economic boost to farmers.

Using yield modelling, the study estimated that agrivoltaic shading could boost farm income from potato production by $3.9bn (£2.95bn) in Germany alone. Other studies have reached similar conclusions.

“This agrivoltaic crop yield bump has been shown for dozens of other crops and solar panel combinations all over the world, including basil, broccoli, celery, corn, grapes, kale, lettuce, pasture grass, peppers, potatoes, tomatoes and more,” lead researcher Prof Joshua Pearce from Western University, Canada, wrote for The Conversation.

The panels, he added, help mitigate climate extremes, such as heatwaves, “delivering meaningful value for farmers”.

Learning another language ‘slows brain aging’

Being multilingual could help slow brain aging, research has found, adding to growing evidence that suggests speaking more than one language boosts cognition.

The international study of more than 86,000 people observed just a small gap between brain age and biological age in those who spoke one language. A “modest” advantage was noted for bilingual participants, with major gains seen among those speaking three or more languages.

The study did not assess level of fluency. However, the findings echo the results of similar studies, including one from 2019, which concluded that learning a second language in old age can improve cognition.

World’s most cycle-friendly cities revealed

In the race to make cities more cycle friendly, there’s a clear winner: Utrecht.

The Dutch city was this week crowned the world’s best for biking. The Danish capital, Copenhagen, and Ghent in Belgium ranked second and third respectively. It begs a question: what makes a city cycle friendly?

According to those behind the EU-funded Copenhagenize Index, it’s not just about safe and connected cycle infrastructure. Researchers also assess how equitable cycling is, and the political support behind biking.

The latest index was dominated by nations in northern Europe. The highest ranking UK city was London (33rd), while Portland, Oregon, (35th) was the best performing US city.

Utrecht’s high ranking came as little surprise to Positive News, which road tested its cycle network last year. Here’s how the Dutch city is stepping green living up a gear.

Literary prize launched for refugee writers

A new literary award celebrating refugee and migrant writers launched this week, offering a cash prize and a publishing deal to the winning scribe.

The Footnote x Counterpoints for fiction will spotlight writers whose work has been shaped by migration. It’s open to people currently living in the UK and Ireland.

“Refugees and migrants make hugely valuable contributions to our arts, culture and society,” said Counterpoints Art, which launched the award with Footnote Press. “Within the context of rising xenophobia, it is vital to keep platforming and amplifying these othered narratives in order to emphasise our shared humanity.”

The Footnote x Counterpoints award is the latest literary prize to showcase writers on the margins. Last year, the Bridport Prize launched its Never Too Late Award to tackle ageism in publishing. It’s open to writers everywhere aged 60 or over.

Photo award brings conservation into focus

A chimpanzee relaxing in a tree has scooped top honours in a photography award spotlighting conservation issues.

The sleepy primate was caught on camera in Uganda, home to one of the largest chimpanzee populations. There are estimated to be around 5,000 of the animals in the country, a number that looks set to be revised after Uganda launched its first ever chimp census this year.

The snap, caught by photographer Federica Cordero, is one of a clutch of winners of the Nature in Focus awards. The India-based competition aims to “reveal fresh perspectives on the natural world and shed light on urgent conservation challenges,” said Rohit Varma, the awards’ co-founder.

This dependency introduces substantial strategic risk.","ASEAN is attempting to secure a foothold in the global semiconductor and electric-vehicle battery industries. Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand have each announced concrete industrial commitments that signal an ambition to move deeper into high-value manufacturing.

These efforts carry strategic implications because semiconductors, power electronics and batteries are essential inputs for artificial intelligence, renewable energy systems and modern defense industries. The region now faces a growing set of geopolitical and engineering pressures that directly affect planned projects, cost structures and national industrial strategies.

This analysis documents the most significant national developments in 2024 and 2025, outlines precise vulnerabilities and provides realistic mitigation measures for decision makers.

Strategic context

In October 2025 China announced additional controls on rare-earth exports and related processing technologies. This decision briefly tightened the market for rare-earth magnets and separated oxides that are crucial for EV motors and semiconductor equipment. Although Beijing later delayed parts of the policy’s implementation, the message was clear: Critical inputs can be restricted with little warning.

Meanwhile, the United States and its allies have continued adjusting export controls on chipmaking equipment. Any further tightening will directly affect the cost and feasibility of new packaging and test facilities across ASEAN. The strategic environment surrounding high technology has therefore become volatile and has placed pressure on firms hoping to expand into advanced electronics production.

Malaysia: advanced packing ambitions

Malaysia is pursuing one of the most aggressive semiconductor-upgrade strategies in Southeast Asia. Penang’s “Silicon Island” project and the new Green Tech Park represent a deliberate shift from assembly to higher-value packaging and design.

Approved semiconductor-related investments reportedly exceeded 70 billion ringgit ($17 billion) between January 2024 and June 2025. Investments include Infineon’s silicon carbide expansion and Carsem’s advanced packaging facilities for AI-related chips.

Advanced-packaging and testing lines in Malaysia’s semiconductor clusters still depend on specialized lithography subsystems, ultra-high-purity precursor chemicals and precision metrology equipment.

These imports are increasingly vulnerable because Malaysia’s new export-control regime now requires notifications for high-performance AI chips and equipment, creating possible bottlenecks and compliance burdens.

For example, Malaysia’s July 2025 directive requires exporters to notify authorities at least 30 days in advance when shipping US-origin high-performance AI chips, signaling that regulatory headwinds may also apply upstream in tool and component supply chains.

Without expedited import lanes, delays in receiving critical equipment would postpone factory commissioning in locations such as Penang, driving up capital costs through extended financing periods.

The Malaysian government must fast-track customs and import lanes for critical equipment, co-finance spare-parts pools for fabs and invest in infrastructure near semiconductor clusters such as high-quality water, power reliability and waste-treatment.

In parallel, public-private training centers should train large numbers of precision-manufacturing engineers.

Indonesia: nickel dominance, battery dream

Indonesia has leveraged its dominant nickel reserves to pull in major EV battery investments. The flagship project is the nearly $6 billion joint venture between Contemporary Amperex Technology Company (CATL) and Indonesia Battery Corporation in West Java.

A June 2025 Reuters report said the facility is scheduled to begin operations by late 2026 with an initial capacity of 6.9 GWh, with an expansion path toward 15 GWh or more. The scale demonstrates Indonesia’s ambition to anchor the region’s battery ecosystem, but it also highlights the limits of upstream advantage.

Despite controlling the raw material, Indonesia’s battery value chain is not yet integrated. The CATL–IBC project will still depend heavily on imported precursor chemicals, cathode active materials and high-precision manufacturing equipment.

The Reuters report noted that while Indonesia has rapidly expanded nickel processing, the country has not built the full suite of midstream capabilities required for stable cell production. Critical reagents and machinery remain tied to suppliers in China, South Korea and Japan.

This dependency introduces substantial strategic risk. A February 2025 C4ADS report found that Chinese companies control roughly 75% of Indonesia’s nickel-refining capacity.

That concentration means that although production occurs on Indonesian soil, operational control, technology flows and strategic decisions often originate in external corporate or policy environments. Any shift in Chinese domestic policy, export priorities or commercial strategy could ripple through Indonesia’s downstream battery plans and disrupt cell production timelines.

Given these vulnerabilities, Indonesia must accelerate development of domestic precursor and cathode-material facilities to reduce exposure to foreign suppliers. Battery-plant construction should also be sequenced with upgrades to grid capacity, wastewater management and environmental controls, since these engineering systems remain bottlenecks in several industrial zones.

Manufacturers should also design production lines with modularity so they can switch battery chemistries if global markets or reagent availability change.

Thailand: EV hub conversion

Thailand is moving quickly to convert its dominant automotive industry into an electric-vehicle hub. The Board of Investment’s EV 3.5 package, announced in 2025, offers tax incentives, consumer subsidies and import-duty relief through 2027 for manufacturers that commit to local production.

This policy has already shifted investment patterns. BYD opened a $490 million plant in Rayong in mid-2025 with capacity for 150,000 EVs annually, marking one of the largest EV manufacturing commitments in Southeast Asia. Domestic EV registrations also surged to roughly 70,000 units in 2024, up from fewer than 10,000 in 2021.

Despite these gains, Thailand’s EV ecosystem remains dependent on imported battery cells, semiconductor components and rare-earth magnets. ASEAN Briefing’s September 2025 assessment found that Thailand still lacks mid-stream capabilities such as cathode production, electrolyte processing and advanced battery-testing facilities. This dependence exposes the sector to the same vulnerabilities faced by regional semiconductor clusters.

These components also move through logistics systems designed for traditional automotive supply chains. Laem Chabang Port remains optimized for bulk auto parts rather than high-value lithium-ion cells.

EV assemblers reported delays in 2025 due to congestion and manual customs checks on sensitive components during peak export periods. Even minor slowdowns disrupt just-in-time assembly and raise operational costs.

To protect its emerging EV advantage, Thailand must expand bonded logistics zones for battery components, accelerate port digitization and cooperate with ASEAN partners to harmonize battery standards. Without these measures, Thailand’s EV ambitions will remain vulnerable to supply-chain friction and regulatory fragmentation.

Regional Risk Map

Material concentration risk. China’s export controls on rare earths and magnets create leverage points. ASEAN must map critical-element dependencies and invest in regional recycling and stockpiles.

Equipment and technology risk. Restrictive export regimes on chip-making tools raise project execution risk. ASEAN governments should establish pooled spare-parts procurement, trusted procurement corridors and diplomatic waiver channels.

Infrastructure and skills risk. All three countries face co-investment needs in power, water, waste and vocational training aligned with advanced manufacturing. ASEAN-level funding mechanisms and mutual recognition of professional certifications would reduce friction.

ASEAN stands at a pivotal moment. Opportunities to capture semiconductor back-end work, EV battery manufacturing and higher-value electronics are real. Malaysia’s move into advanced packaging, Indonesia’s downstream battery strategy and Thailand’s EV pivot are promising.

They are also fragile. Each depends on imported tools, materials and specialized skills that can be disrupted by geopolitical shifts.

The region’s success will depend on how quickly leaders can reduce those vulnerabilities through strategic infrastructure investment, targeted industrial policy, regional standardization and coordinated risk management.

Without these measures, factories across ASEAN will remain profitable in calm markets but exposed during periods of geopolitical tumult.

Chevy Holiday Magic

Starting Monday, December 1st, 2025, Chevrolet is hitting the road with an event called Chevy Holiday Magic. The show is described as a holiday spectacular that will be powered by a caravan of Chevy Silverado EVs. The traveling show will stop in five different cities. While the display is designed to bring Chevy holiday cheer to different parts of the country, it will also be a chance for Chevrolet to demonstrate how EVs can travel long distances, be effective for towing, as well as be used to provide power to displays or homes.

The Silverado EVs will help light up events at each stop along the way. The displays will include illuminating a holiday tree and a light show. The events will be held in conjunction with local Chevrolet dealers and highlight local choirs singing holiday carols. The festivities will include hot cocoa and smores. The displays will show a number of other Chevrolet vehicles as well as the incredible 1987 Suburban that stars in Chevrolet’s holiday ad this year. Chevrolet will also be working with the Toys for Tots chapter in each city to help spread holiday cheer to families in need.

From San Diego to Detroit, the caravan will travel 2,987 miles, with stops in Dallas, Nashville and Atlanta, to demonstrate the truck’s capability to travel long distances.

The 2026 Chevrolet Silverado

According to Chevy, the Silverado EVs get up to 494 miles of range, and the truck’s offboard power can use the truck’s battery to provide electric power to the truck's 11 outlets. That is based on the Maximum Range Silverado Work Truck.

Chevrolet hasn’t released all of the trim levels that will be available for the 2026 models, however it recently announced a new Trail Boss off-roading package for 2026 Silverado EVs. I would expect we will still see the Work Truck, the LT and the RST. The Silverado EV is also available with the Sidewinder feature that allows the truck to have four-wheel steer, or the ability to crabwalk. That perk has been popular on the HUMMER EVs and is also available on the Cadillac Escalade IQ.

Those “ingredients” are in the memorandum of understanding that Carney and Alberta Premier Danielle Smith signed in Calgary to great fanfare, including two standing ovations for the prime minister from a business crowd. Nothing is certain without a private sector investor because neither Ottawa nor Alberta say they are interested in underwriting a pipeline with tens of billions of taxpayers’ dollars.

Hodgson said the deal includes a July 1 deadline for any private sector investor pitches that must meet several requirements, including buy-in from the B.C. government and the province’s First Nations groups.

“The proponent has not come forward with a route. They have not come forward with a proposal at this point in time,” said Hodgson.

“They got some work to do,” he added, saying it is “premature” for critics to worry about a new oil pipeline to the B.C. coast.

Carney has spend months rolling back energy and environment policies championed by Justin Trudeau’s Liberal government, starting with Canada’s work on the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change.

The MOU did away with an emissions cap on oil and gas, clean energy regulations, rules that punished companies for “greenwashing” and could potential lift a ban on oil tankers off the B.C. coast — policies Guilbeault helped create.

Hodgson said critics should not be in a rush to judge Carney’s commitment to fighting climate change. “I have known him for 25 years,” said Hodgson. “When he has a vision for what needs to happen, he creates KPIs [key performance indicators] — and we better damn deliver them.”

Carney was the U.N. Special Envoy on Climate Action and Finance before entering politics this year, winning the Liberal leadership and then a federal election on the pledge that he was best suited to protect Canada’s economy against President Donald Trump’s economic attacks on Canada.

“The prime minister is at the center of some pretty complex geopolitics right now, and is maybe charging a slightly different path based on the realities we find in the world today,” Hodgson said.

“There was a path to get to net zero under the previous government. That path was running into real challenges with a number of provinces. This MOU sets out another way to do it.”

Hodgson pointed out that the MOU affirms Canada’s commitment to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. The deal includes a new target to cut methane emissions, a requirement that Alberta and Ottawa reach an agreement on industrial carbon pricing by April 1 that could raise Alberta’s current carbon price from C$95 per ton to $130 per ton, and a focus on developing clean nuclear energy and sharing electricity better across the western Canadian provinces.

Hodgson was optimistic heading into a Friday meeting with British Columbia Premier David Eby, a day after the premier called the pipeline proposal an “energy vampire,” touting instead the billions of dollars worth of fully funded and shovel-ready LNG export projects in his province.

“We have a very constructive and productive relationship with the British Columbia government,” Hodgson said. “It’s not an accident that there are more projects on the major projects list in British Columbia than any other province.”

Carney’s minister said that said that when Eby called to ask for help to ease the effect of Trump’s softwood lumber tariffs on B.C. forestry workers, the government reacted.

“We got on a plane, we came out, we sat down and we talked about the challenges. We said we will come back with solutions,” Hodgson said, citing this week’s announcement by Ottawa of an aid package for steel and lumber.

“We have a very respectful and constructive conversation between our two levels of government,” Hodgson said.",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Ffb%2Ffc%2F91cf687247829ad5e6b4dfb7a6f0%2Fcp175382787.JPG,N,,2025-11-28 17:59:26.667809

Not this week.

In the hours between the party-room meeting and Senate question time at 2pm that afternoon, the Greens’ environment spokesperson, Sarah Hanson-Young, was not fronting the cameras but instead holed-up in the office of her Labor counterpart, Murray Watt, thrashing out a deal to finally re-write the nation’s dated and broken environment protection laws.

Around the same time, the opposition leader, Sussan Ley, was raging on Sky News about the “totally insufficient” offer that Watt had made to secure the Coalition’s support.

Sign up: AU Breaking News email

The government says it was genuinely prepared to deal with either party as late as Wednesday night, adamant its overhaul of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act would pass the Senate before parliament finished for the year on Thursday.

But the striking contrast between the two in that brief period on Tuesday – the Greens, conspicuous in their silence, and the Coalition, seemingly resolute in their resistance – suggested one side was always more likely.

Whereas the Greens were consistent with their demands throughout negotiations, the opposition continually shifted the goalposts – lobbing new requests at the government as late as 9.30pm on Wednesday, according to government and Coalition sources.

After 72 hours of high-stakes negotiations and tense internal deliberations, in particular among Hanson-Young’s colleagues, Anthony Albanese announced the deal at 8am on Thursday to pass the laws with the Greens.

The agreement included concessions to the Greens to prevent the fast-tracking of coal and gas, removing the exemption for native forest logging within 18 months and tightening a loophole for agricultural land-clearing.

The bill was rushed through the Senate on Thursday night, an abrupt ending to the five-year struggle to act on Graeme Samuel’s blueprint to fix the nature laws.

“The bills were rammed through with almost no time for scrutiny,” the independent senator David Pocock said, decrying the package as only a “partial” win for nature.

The timing could not have been more apt.

Almost exactly 12 months ago, Albanese intervened to scuttle a deal that Watt’s predecessor, Tanya Plibersek, had reached with the Greens and Pocock to create a federal environment protection agency in a frantic conclusion to the 2024 parliamentary year.

This time, Albanese was not only prepared to negotiate with the Greens but offer far more concessions, albeit on a bill that included much more than a federal EPA.

What changed? The political climate for one.

After winning the May federal election and no longer anxious to avoid a campaign backlash in the mining state of Western Australia, Albanese appointed Watt – his “Mr Fix it” – with the imprimatur to negotiate whatever deal was required to pass the laws.

A ‘one-time’ offer to fix nature

Senior Labor sources familiar with negotiations say the Greens under their new leader, Larissa Waters, were “very good to deal with”, contrasting it with obstinance they believe characterised the minor party’s approach under Adam Bandt.

Albanese said as much on Thursday morning, praising the “maturity” of the party he has spent much of his political career fighting.

The prime minister injected himself into the negotiations on Wednesday morning, meeting with Waters, Hanson-Young and Watt in his office to iron-out the remaining sticking points.

Albanese was clear the “one-time” offer would be pulled if the Greens did not grab it this week.

The ultimatum put the Greens in a bind. While reluctant to accept a deal that did not directly combat the climate crisis, party veterans were conscious that any delays would give industry – particularly cashed-up miners – time to water-down or kill the reforms.

But the Greens also had leverage. Labor’s self-imposed deadline to pass the laws this week meant both it and the Coalition knew they could extract more than they otherwise could.

The Greens convened another party-room around midday on Wednesday to debate their final position.

With the government ruling out a so-called “climate trigger”, securing protection for forests, and quickly, became the Greens’ main priority.

The government initial offer of a three-year timeframe to end the exemption was resisted because, in Hanson-Young’s words, “three years to let the loggers get in there and trash our native forest is three years too long”.

Labor eventually agreed to halve that timeframe to 18 months as well as crack down on land-clearing, significantly bridging the divide between the two parties.

Before the final deliberations, the Greens sounded out influential figures in the environment movement to seek assurances they would publicly support them if they agreed a deal.

It was time to make a decision.

‘Know when to hold them, when to fold them’

Even as expectations of a Greens deal grew throughout Wednesday, including among industry lobbyists who wanted an agreement between the major parties, Labor continued to pursue the other option.

At 11am on Wednesday, Watt met with his Liberal counterpart, Angie Bell, the shadow resources minister, Susan McDonald, and Tasmania senator Jonno Duniam – the former shadow environment spokesperson who was pushing hard for a deal.

Watt was prepared to accept some of the opposition’s requests, including constraining the powers of the federal EPA, but wouldn’t cede on others, such a requirement for proponents of heavy polluting projects to disclose greenhouse gas emissions as part of their application.

Multiple sources confirmed Bell raised new demands, complicating the chances of a deal between the major parties and frustrating her own colleagues.

About 4pm and after their party-room meeting, Waters and Hanson-Young made the short walk to the prime minister’s office to finalise the negotiations before Albanese was due at The Lodge for Christmas drinks with press gallery journalists.

As late as Wednesday, the Greens were prepared to oppose the laws if they couldn’t secure a satisfactory deal.

Waters and Hanson-Young left that meeting confident they had.

“[In negotiations] you do have to know when to hold them, when to fold them, and when to play the cards you’ve got to get an outcome,” Hanson-Young said.

As festivities at The Lodge started around 5pm, the official word from the government was that a deal – with either side – was yet to be reached.

That was technically true. Amendments were still being negotiated through the night.

Albanese would need to inform stakeholders, including the Tasmanian premier, Jeremy Rockliff, whose state’s logging industry faces an uncertain future after the deal.

The prime minister had already discussed the prospects of a Greens deal with the Western Australian premier, Roger Cook, who had joined forces with the state’s powerful mining to successfully lobby Albanese to shelve Plibersek’s proposal.

Cook did make another 11th-hour intervention, posting a short video to Instagram appealing to the Coalition to broker a pro-business package with Labor.

The opposition continued negotiations late into Wednesday night, submitting revised demands at 9.30pm.

Senior Coalition figures still believed a deal could be reached as late as Thursday morning.

They were right – it just wasn’t with them.

The fight for climate goes on

“Today, I can announce our government’s landmark environmental law reform will pass the parliament today, heralding a new era for the environment and productivity in Australia,” Albanese said at the Thursday morning press conference alongside Watt and the finance minister, Katy Gallagher.

Waters, Hanson-Young and McKim stood up soon after, heralding the progress for environmental protection while warning the fight to consider climate effects in federal nature laws was far from over.

“This has been a tough negotiation but we’ve managed to deliver some tough blows,” Hanson-Young said.

At her own press conference, Ley decried the “dirty deal” between Labor and the Greens and insisted the Coalition had acted in “good faith” to broker an agreement.

Samuel – who Ley, as Scott Morrison’s environment minister, commissioned for the review that inspired the reforms – had a different view.

“They have manoeuvred themselves into irrelevance on this matter,” the former consumer watchdog said of the Coalition.

“Absolute irrelevance.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/56d02fabab278645644cc7cc9676a64c967134eb/0_0_2500_2000/master/2500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6b882d117a2b82c70ac51ae33d7baefd",N,,2025-11-28 16:59:36.191410

“Pensions are being phased out as a policy,” Whitmer said on the show, noting that future generations of state employees won’t receive them—a move designed to shrink the liability over time.

Perhaps more concerning than legacy pension obligations is the current business climate. A staggering 87% of CEOs in Michigan expect a weaker overall state economy over the next decade, Whitmer said during her appearance.

The culprit? Trade policy uncertainty that’s hitting Michigan’s manufacturing and agricultural sectors particularly hard.

“The tariff chaos and unpredictability of trade policies coming out of Washington, D.C.” is creating stress and uncertainty throughout the state economy, Whitmer said. Michigan’s heavy reliance on advanced manufacturing—especially automotive—makes it uniquely vulnerable to tariff fluctuations.

Whitmer advocated for using tariffs “like a scalpel, not a sledgehammer,” suggesting a more targeted approach to trade policy.

The EV Transition Gamble

Michigan is betting big on electric vehicles and battery manufacturing to maintain its automotive dominance. The state pledged $1 billion through its “Make It in Michigan” program for five EV battery-related projects.

“Batteries are the heaviest component, where they are built will become the center of gravity for the long-term dominance in mobility,” Whitmer said, positioning Michigan to be the place where batteries are manufactured.

But this strategy carries risk. The University of Michigan's Michigan Economic Outlook for 2025–2027 projects a 3.9% increase in per-capita income this year, but warns that overall growth will slow. Meanwhile, Michigan ranks 49th nationally in population growth—a major long-term economic headwind, according to the Michigan State Revenue and Economic Outlook published by the House Fiscal Agency.

Controversial Revenue Sources

Michigan’s school aid fund relies on sales tax but also draws from marijuana taxes generating $270 million and gaming taxes. These revenue sources—often called “sin taxes”—are described as the “easiest taxes for legislators to take votes on,” though critics argue they disproportionately affect lower-income individuals, according to Whitmer.

The state also increased its Working Families Tax Credit from 6% to 30%, a form of redistribution that Whitmer said incentivizes full-time work and disproportionately supports families raising children.

For investors watching Michigan’s municipal bonds or companies with significant Michigan operations, the combination of CEO pessimism, slow population growth, and massive unfunded pension liabilities suggests caution. The state’s EV bet may pay off long-term, but the transition period looks increasingly turbulent.

Virginia-based QTS Data Centers on Tuesday announced it will partner with the Building Trades Council of South Central Wisconsin to build a $12 billion data center campus in Dane County. The project will include a $50 million community commitment for the area and will support up to 5,000 trade jobs, officials said.

The project will span up to 1,600 acres, with the first three years focused on constructing five data center buildings across 650 acres in the town of Vienna, a QTS presentation showed. The company will also partner with Alliant Energy to develop 750 megawatts of renewable energy generation. The company said it will pay for all project energy infrastructure.

The DeForest Village Board met Nov. 18 and reviewed a presentation from QTS Data Centers. The developer plans to annex land from Vienna into the village of DeForest, and no action was planned for the meeting, according to the village agenda.

“Before any development may proceed, several public processes would need to occur within the village of DeForest as well as within some State of Wisconsin departments and regional public agencies,” village officials said. “This review and consideration of necessary approvals may occur over the course of many months or more.”

QTS officials said the multibillion-dollar investment will rely on union labor to fill thousands of construction jobs and demonstrate the company’s commitment to local investment and workforce development.

“This partnership with QTS reflects our shared commitment to ensuring that the digital infrastructure our company depends on is built by the highly skilled union workers who live in the very communities it will serve,” said Tracey Griffith, executive director of the Building Trades Council of South Central Wisconsin, in a statement. “When local union members are on the job, projects are built safely and with the exceptional skill and quality our workforce is known for. The economic benefits stay right here at home in Dane County — supporting families, strengthening neighborhoods and driving long-term growth across Wisconsin. By formalizing this partnership, we are investing directly in our workers and in the economic vitality of the communities they call home.”

The labor organization is made of 17 local unions representing more than 6,000 building trades members in Wisconsin, including the North Central States Regional Council of Carpenters, the Wisconsin Laborers’ District Council and the International Union of Operating Engineers Local 139, officials said. All the groups announced support of the project.

“The QTS data center project means nearly a decade of steady work for LIUNA members right here in Dane County,” said Kent Miller, president and business manager of the Wisconsin Laborers’ District Council, in a statement. “Our training center is in DeForest, and this project keeps our members close to home — so they can earn family-supporting wages, be home for dinner, and still make it to their kids’ ballgames.”

“Our joint effort is about more than technology, it’s about people,” said Ryan Hunter, chief operations officer at QTS Data Centers, in a statement. “It allows us to move forward with the full support of Wisconsin’s impressive skilled union workforce, building a campus that strengthens the economy, supports families and sustainably powers the digital infrastructure of the future.”

QTS will work with local officials and establish a $50 million commitment to support education, workforce development and housing initiatives across Dane County, officials said. The company will also partner with Madison College and the University of Wisconsin for workforce and research programs respectively.

Vantage Data Centers, Oracle and OpenAI and Microsoft are working on separate, multi-billion-dollar data centers in different parts of the state. In October, Vantage Data Centers announced it partnered with the Wisconsin Building Trades Council to build the $15 billion Lighthouse data center in Port Washington. That project is expected to see a peak workforce of more than 4,000 skilled construction workers over three years.

The construction team in the Port Washington project includes Maryland-based Whiting-Turner, New York-based Turner Construction, Missouri-based McCarthy and Iowa-based Weitz.

Upper House candidate Deepa Mathew said news buried in the business section of The Australian newspaper revealed that expensive and unreliable energy was making South Australia an unattractive place to invest.

BHP Billiton was fast-tracking big copper mining investments in South America but slow-walking South Australia because of the government's decarbonisation priority and too much red tape.

The Australian reported that BHP was ""cautiously advancing its $20bn-plus investment to dramatically expand copper production in South Australia – a megaproject which could deliver another nation-defining resource play to rival the Pilbara"".

The mega project known as Copper SA was drifting and with BHP putting of a decision on an energy intensive smelter until 2028.

The Australian reported:

""The energy crisis is stark. ABS inflation figures this week show electricity costs in Australia have surged 22 per cent in two years, excluding rebates. Costs here are two or more times higher than in Canada and other countries where BHP operates, and 50-100 per cent higher than in the US.""

Ms Mathew said South Australia was saddled with massive government debt and needed wealth-creating projects like Copper SA so families could once again flourish economically.

""Peter Malinauskas is letting investment slip through South Australia's fingers to South America and that is putting pressure on families.

""It's time for ideology to stop driving energy policy.

""To take the pressure off families, South Australia needs abundant, cheap and reliable energy so industry can invest and create the jobs our kids need.

""Windmills farms and solar factories can't do it and there is no battery in existence that can power a city let along a copper smelter.""

Ms Mathew said Family First would always prioritise cheap and reliable energy like gas, coal and in the future uranium over expensive and ideologically driven windmills and solar factories.

U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is providing an update on its reconsideration of the final risk management rule for perchloroethylene (PCE) under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). As noted in the November 28, 2025 declaration to the court, EPA expects to publish a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to amend the 2024 PCE Rule in or around summer 2026 and publish a final rule in 2027. EPA is also considering options for extending certain compliance dates established by the 2024 PCE Rule, including options involving a more expedited rulemaking process to address compliance date extensions. This reconsideration is being done in accordance with applicable law, Executive Orders, and Administration policies, including Executive Order 14219 “Ensuring Lawful Governance and Implementing the President’s ‘Department of Government Efficiency’ Deregulatory Initiative” and the EPA’s Powering the Great American Comeback Initiative Pillar I: Clean Air, Land, and Water for Every American.

After the 2024 PCE Rule was published, several legal challenges were filed. These petitions for review were consolidated in the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. The Court previously granted a temporary abeyance while EPA conducts a rulemaking to reassess the challenged rule and ordered EPA to update the Court with its plans for issuing a new rule.

It’s a company designed to build many times more, the CEO of the upstart EV maker told the editorial board of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution last week. To get there, Rivian is banking on its newest vehicle, the R2, a two-row crossover, to be a big hit.

Initial manufacturing of the R2 will start in Illinois, but Scaringe said production will expand to its future factory an hour east of Atlanta when it opens, albeit years later than initially expected, in 2028. Future models, including the smaller R3 and R3X, are expected to follow.

“The more people that experience an EV, it’s like a one-way door,” Scaringe said. “It’s hard to go into an EV and then back to a (gas-powered) vehicle.”

He said Rivian will start customer deliveries of R2 early next year, and soon start vertical construction of the Georgia plant after a ceremonial groundbreaking in September. In a wide-ranging interview with the AJC, Scaringe went into detail about the company’s future, why Georgia is crucial to that success and the future of the auto industry.

Scaringe likes to say that software is as important to modern cars as the nuts and bolts of assembly.

Rivian is designed to do both. That strategy entranced investors while creating its own challenges and setbacks when the pandemic struck, but Scaringe argues it’s a framework made to support more than just a niche automaker.

The need to ramp up production is why Georgia is such a critical cog in Rivian’s machine aimed at rivaling Tesla as a leader of America’s new school of automaking.

“This is an investment you don’t make for one product cycle,” Scaringe said of his company’s planned $5 billion factory an hour east of Atlanta. “You make the investment for many product cycles. It’s a multidecade, multi-billion dollar investment.”

Next year is a vital one for California-based Rivian, which plans to launch R2 at a starting price of $45,000 to target a mass market. The forthcoming Georgia plant is poised to multiply the number of R2s rolling off assembly lines.

Confident it will succeed, Scaringe said the R2 and its iterations will provide the same boost to Rivian that Tesla found with its mid-priced Model 3 sedan and Model Y crossover.

Those two Tesla models make up more than 40% of all EV sales this year through September, according to Cox Automotive data. Cox Enterprises, the owner of the AJC, also owns Cox Automotive and a 3% stake in Rivian.

“In something like clothing or cars or goods that reflect your own personality, you tend to see many winners,” Scaringe said. “So having a single player with nearly 50% market share is not a reflection of a healthy market — it’s a reflection of a highly underserved market.”

September was a new high-water mark for EV sales, but it’s expected to be a temporary peak. Federal tax credits worth up to $7,500 for qualifying new EV purchases were revoked at the end of that month, creating a fleeting window of opportunity for the EV curious.

“The training wheels are coming off,” said Stephanie Valdez-Streaty, director of operations management at Cox Automotive. “This shift will test whether the electric vehicle market is mature enough to thrive on its own fundamentals or still needs support to expand further.”

For Rivian, Scaringe said the startup’s history until now has been about learning and growing. He said Rivian’s Georgia investments will show the company is ready for the expanded spotlight.

“We’re a much, much more mature business,” he said. “And we’ve built processes to handle some of these unexpected externalities.”

Learning curve

The path for Rivian hasn’t been smooth.

The company’s 2021 initial public offering was among the largest in U.S. history. The company’s valuation peaked at more than $100 billion, briefly surpassing juggernauts like Ford, an early Rivian investor, and General Motors.

Rivian also courted other deep-pocked investors including Amazon, inking a $1 billion deal to supply the e-commerce giant with 100,000 EV vans.

But Wall Street’s stratospheric expectations soon came back to Earth amid the COVID-19 pandemic, a supply chain that buckled under the pressure and Rivian’s struggles to meet production demands. Scaringe said it was a tough time for his company, which has yet to turn a profit.

Among the challenges Rivian faced were getting components because it didn’t have the deep manufacturing history of traditional automakers.

“It was a combination of learning for the first time, launching multiple products, dealing with a global pandemic and then being last in line to get parts from suppliers,” he said.

Those scars have informed Rivian’s R2 strategy, reframing Georgia’s role in the company’s long-term plans.

When unveiling the prototype R2 in March 2024, Scaringe sent shock waves through the Peach State by pausing the Georgia plant’s development. The decision was cited as a temporary cost-cutting measure and an effort to focus on launching R2 more quickly from the company’s existing Illinois factory.

Within 24 hours of the R2 reveal, Rivian announced it had nearly 70,000 preorders. Scaringe declined to provide any updates to that figure but said “the excitement hasn’t waned.”

Rivian later announced it would resume construction of the Georgia factory in 2026, and will create 7,000 promised jobs.

State and local leaders also provided an estimated $1.5 billion incentive package to recruit Rivian to Georgia. Most of those benefits materialize only if the company meets its job and investment figures by 2030. Rivian will also receive support from a $6.6 billion federal loan.

In recent days, Rivian opened its East Coast headquarters along the Atlanta Beltline, which the company said will employ 500 workers by the end of next year. The back-end research and development work, Scaringe said, is just as vital to Rivian’s success as its mechanical chops.

“We didn’t design the business to be selling 50,000 cars a year,” he said, citing the company’s current production output. “We have a cost structure, particularly on the R & D side, that was set up to be a much, much bigger business.”

Creating leverage

Unlike traditional automakers, Rivian and electrified peers like Tesla have developed a new technology backbone for their vehicles.

Most conventional cars have more than 100 small computers called electronic control units to handle small tasks.

One ECU handles seat adjustments. Another is in charge of side mirror controls. Yet another is tasked with injecting fuel into the engine. Those ECUs are developed by separate part suppliers and often include a mishmash of operating systems.

“It’s a very, very messy architecture,” Scaringe said. “It’s precisely the opposite of what you’d want to have.”

Rivian, along with Tesla, have a handful of more powerful computers called domain control units that handle several tasks. Scaringe said that decision reduces assembly complexity, saves thousands of dollars on computer chips and will pay off once the company reaches a certain scale.

“We have more computer engineers and software engineers at Rivian than we have mechanical engineers by a pretty significant degree,” he said.

For automakers to succeed in the future, Scaringe said, they will have to have a software backbone like Rivian and Tesla. They’ll get there one of two ways — developing it themselves or finding a technology partner.

The company’s technology platform caught the attention of the world’s second-largest automaker, Volkswagen Group.

In June 2024, Rivian and VW announced a joint software partnership worth an estimated $5.8 billion. Rivian agreed to contribute technology to the German auto giant’s fleet of new EVs, while VW’s financial contributions would support Rivian as it ramped up production.

Scaringe said that partnership also gives Rivian newfound leverage when negotiating with suppliers and preparing to launch R2 — both in Illinois and in Georgia.

“(Suppliers) are super excited to work with us because the choice we make in Rivian vehicles is also the choice that goes into Volkswagen vehicles, which is Porsche, Audi, VW, Bentley and a whole host of brands,” Scaringe said. “It’s a complete flip of the nature of that relationship.”

With the groundwork laid — and ground literally about to break east of Atlanta — Scaringe said Rivian’s next chapter is filled with potential.

“Now it’s about execution,” Scaringe said.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/gmtoday.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/5/dc/5dc406a4-6abc-4307-9659-f46a64b94a0f/6929f81557081.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-11-28 15:59:43.640482

He then launched a Major Projects Office to fast-track initiatives he said would strengthen Canada's economic sovereignty, creating a bulwark against the impacts of Trump's tariffs.
""Canada and Alberta are striking a new partnership to build a stronger, more sustainable, and more independent Albertan and Canadian economy,"" Carney said.
- Carney, a former central banker, worked on climate issues before joining politics in January, but has emphasized market-driven solutions to environmental challenges.
Increased oil exports to Asia would reduce Canada's economic dependence on an unreliable United States, he said.","Critics accuse Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney of betraying the fight against climate change.

Others say he is facing reality and has no choice but boost polluting sectors that are vital to an economy being punished by US President Donald Trump's trade war.

But there is no dispute that since replacing former prime minister Justin Trudeau in March Carney has repositioned his Liberal Party on the environment.

Immediately after taking office, Carney scrapped Trudeau's unpopular carbon tax on individuals.

He then launched a Major Projects Office to fast-track initiatives he said would strengthen Canada's economic sovereignty, creating a bulwark against the impacts of Trump's tariffs.

Mining and natural gas projects -- criticized by some environmental advocates -- were among the early picks.

But the most dramatic development came on Thursday, when Carney struck a deal with the conservative-led energy-producing Alberta province to advance a new oil pipeline, while increasing overall oil and gas production.

""Canada and Alberta are striking a new partnership to build a stronger, more sustainable, and more independent Albertan and Canadian economy,"" Carney said.

""We will make Canada an energy superpower, drive down our emissions and diversify our export markets.”

The deal marked a clear pivot for Carney's Liberal Party and a departure from the policies that defined Trudeau's decade in power.

Alberta Premier Danielle Smith, who loathed Trudeau's policies, said this month that ""the tone of federal government has done a 180 in the last year.""

Steven Guilbeault, a member of Carney's cabinet, who was also Trudeau's environment minister, agreed.

He resigned Thursday, hours after the pipeline deal was signed.

Guilbeault said he entered politics ""to champion the fight against climate change,"" but that key green policies he implemented with Trudeau were being ""dismantled"" under Carney.

- Climate policy 'erosion'? -

Carney, a former central banker, worked on climate issues before joining politics in January, but has emphasized market-driven solutions to environmental challenges.

In 2019, he became a UN envoy focused on mobilizing public and private finance to help achieve the goals of the Paris Accords.

He then joined the massive Canadian multinational firm Brookfield, steering private capital to aid climate action.

The Alberta pipeline plan is in its infancy and may never move forward.

But Carney's memorandum of understanding with Alberta to advance an initiative that involves piping bitumen to Canada's northwest Pacific coast and building a massive port to accommodate oil tankers has drawn outrage.

Carney said the plan could be a win-win.

Increased oil exports to Asia would reduce Canada's economic dependence on an unreliable United States, he said.

And, he stressed, the deal requires oil companies to pay a steep industrial carbon tax, which could help fund cleaner energy sources, while the impact of rising emissions would be offset through carbon capture -- a controversial technology.

Sierra Club Canada's communications chief, Conor Curtis, told AFP there has been an ""erosion of climate policy,"" under the new Liberal government.

""A new oil pipeline is not necessary. We are in the middle of a global transition to renewable energy,"" he said in an interview before Thursday's signing.

- 'Profound disruptions' -

Tim McMillan, the former president of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, said Carney had no choice but to embrace the oil sector.

""After 10 years of cancelled projects and lowering GDP per capita and standards of living in Canada, we're at a point, especially with the US tariff threats, that Canada needs to look at our strengths,"" McMillan told AFP.

""Oil and gas are at the top of that list.""

Even Guilbeault, a prominent environmental activist before entering politics, acknowledged Carney was in a tough spot, conceding that Trump had triggered ""profound disruptions"" in Canada's key economic relationship.

""Despite this difficult economic context, I remain one of those for whom environmental issues must remain front and center,"" he said.",https://www.rtl.lu/sassets/rtl2008.lu/nt/p/2025/11/29/01/8373dd5278c83919d39c20da5ac6c35b.jpeg,N,,2025-11-28 19:58:30.910684
