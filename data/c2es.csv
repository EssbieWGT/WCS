It seems that every day there is a new headline that is just as dramatic and important as the last. With the constant buzz of news, it’s easy to forget how much the Trump administration has shaped climate policy in the U.S. and around the world. From leaving the Paris Climate Agreement on day one to the administration’s most recent dismantling of the National Center for Atmospheric Research, climate science and the environment have taken a hit under Donald Trump’s presidency.

January: Trump’s First Executive Orders

Trump’s second first day as president of the United States was January 20, 2025. Promising to sign 100 executive orders on his first day, he ultimately signed 26. In those 26 executive orders, Trump began his environmental damage.

An executive order (EO) is a statement by the president that instructs federal agencies on how to implement and enforce laws. While they are not laws themselves, they indicate to Congress which laws to prioritize. Many presidents use executive orders to rescind orders issued by previous presidents.

President Trump reversed many of former President Joe Biden’s climate-focused orders, including the creation of clean energy task forces and the Climate Change Support Office, the “30 by 30” conservation initiative, and federal efforts to improve sustainable, climate-resilient infrastructure in the U.S. In an order titled “Putting America First in International Environmental Agreements,” Trump pulled the U.S. out of the Paris Climate Agreement and revoked the International Climate Finance Plan.

He also signed orders expanding fossil fuel use and exploration, “Unleashing American Energy” and “Unleashing Alaska’s Extraordinary Resource Potential,” as well as an order “Declaring a National Energy Emergency,” which states that inadequate energy production in the U.S. is an “unusual and extraordinary threat.” He notably excludes wind and solar power from the order’s definition of “energy,” highlighting the construction of pipelines and the leasing of land for oil and gas production.

In the first two weeks of his presidency, the Trump administration scrubbed thousands of data pages from government websites, many of which related to climate change. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) website lost all references to climate change on its homepage.

February: Paper Straws, Layoffs, and the National Energy Dominance Council

Trump began February in a battle with paper straws. On February 10, he signed an EO stating that the government will exclusively use plastic straws. He banned the use of paper straws in federal buildings, saying that they “don’t work.”

On February 14, Trump signed an order establishing the National Energy Dominance Council to enhance energy security. The council aims to expand the production and use of oil, gas, coal, and other critical resources, excluding wind and solar.

Throughout the month, the EPA dismissed over 400 employees and froze funds for federally approved projects. Democratic Senator Ed Markey from Massachusetts said:

“Thousands of EPA projects worth tens of billions of dollars have been illegally shut down, shut off, and shut out of funding in red and blue states alike.”

Government websites continued to scrub mentions of climate change. On February 19, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) sent a memo titled “Recovery Guidance for Terminology Changes.” The memo included 10 instances of “climate change terminology to remove,” including “global warming,” “net-zero,” and “changing climate.”

March: The Trump Administration Cuts Emissions Regulations

March was a difficult month for climate regulations in the United States. Chris Wright, Trump’s energy secretary, kicked off the month by saying that climate change is “a side-effect of building the modern world” and encouraging the world to use more fossil fuels.

Trump concluded the month by stating that automobile emissions do not affect the environment. When Trump announced tentative plans to relax pollution limits on vehicles, he claimed that it wouldn’t “mean a damn bit of difference to the environment.” With these sentiments as bookends to the month, it makes sense that regulations took a hit.

The EPA Administrator, Lee Zeldin, announced 31 deregulation actions on March 12. Among these actions, the EPA halted enforcement of pollution regulations at energy facilities, including the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program and the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards. They also attacked the Biden-Harris Administration Risk Management Program, which required facilities to develop risk management plans for handling hazardous chemicals.

On March 27, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) voted to end rules requiring companies to disclose greenhouse gas emissions and climate risks. “The goal of today’s Commission action and notification to the court is to cease the Commission’s involvement in the defense of the costly and unnecessarily intrusive climate change disclosure rules,” said Acting SEC Chairman Mark T. Uyeda.

In late March, Trump signed an executive order titled “Immediate Expansion of American Timber Production.” The order opened up crucial habitats and conservation areas for logging. He also called for expansion in mining, signing “Immediate Measures To Increase American Mineral Production.”

April: Trump’s 100 Days and 145 Actions

April 29 marked Trump’s 100th day in office and 145 climate rollbacks. In his first few months as president, Trump launched more actions against the environment than he did during his entire first term.

Earlier in the month, he signed an executive order to revive the American coal industry. The order highlighted Trump’s desire for strong energy security and AI competitiveness. He also lifted air pollution restrictions on coal plants, hoping to avoid closures and increase production and use.

Trump went on to attack state climate laws. He signed an executive order titled “Protecting American Energy From State Overreach,” which claimed that specific state laws undermined federal efforts for energy dominance.

Then on April 9, the administration canceled funding for the U.S. Global Change Research Program. The program is key to publishing the National Climate Assessment, a comprehensive guide to climate change.

May: An End to Climate Justice

May began with the Trump administration cutting the EPA’s Energy Star program, which highlighted the energy efficiency of home appliances.

Additionally, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) ceased updates to its billion-dollar disaster tracker. The administration claimed that the tracker caused climate anxiety as the dramatic increase in disasters highlighted human-caused climate change.

On May 26, the Trump administration announced cuts to a Biden-era guidance on greenhouse gases. The guidance required new energy projects to consider environmental justice and climate policies.

June: “Drill, Baby, Drill”

The Department of the Interior encouraged more mining throughout the United States by rolling back mining standards. Following the day-one executive order to unleash Alaska’s energy potential, the Trump administration began moving forward with opening Alaska to mining.

On June 11, the government signed an agreement with JERA Co., Inc., a Japanese energy company, to sell liquified natural gas (LNG). The U.S. promised to supply JERA with 5.5 million tons of LNG annually.

July: Climate Science Denied

The U.S. Department of Energy released a 140-page report denying climate science on July 29. Fact-checkers found that the report contained more than 100 false or misleading claims, prompting more than 85 scientists to issue a rebuttal.

Earlier in the month, Trump signed an EO claiming that “green” energy hinders national security and compromises the grid. In the order, he encouraged federal agencies to phase out subsidies for wind, solar, and other forms of renewable energy.

August: Wind and Solar Tax Credits Eliminated

The Department of the Interior made moves to limit wind and solar projects. U.S. Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum said:

“Gargantuan, unreliable, intermittent energy projects hold America back from achieving U.S. Energy Dominance.”

The EPA cancelled the Biden-era “Solar for All” program, which aimed to provide low-income families with access to solar energy. The $7 billion grant was intended to provide low-cost, clean energy to over 900,000 households.

Early in the month, the administration also asked NASA to decommission two climate satellites that provide information about carbon dioxide. Farmers rely heavily on these satellites, which also provide data on crop health.

In an ongoing effort to remove information from public view, the EPA ceased updating its “Supply Chain Greenhouse Gas Emissions Factors” database.

September: Trump Calls Climate Change a “Con Job”

Trump spoke at the United Nations on September 23, calling climate change a hoax. He said that climate change was the “greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world” and admonished countries that had adopted renewable energy sources.

At the Energy Department’s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, “climate change,” “green,” and “decarbonization” were added to a list of words to avoid. The list already included words such as “sustainability,” “carbon footprint,” and “tax breaks/subsidies.” The list is a growing part of Trump’s efforts to downplay and ignore the realities of climate change.

October: Government Shut Down, Pollutants Scale Up

While the government was shut down in October, work continued in the fossil fuel sector. The Department of the Interior opened over 250,000 acres of land in Nebraska and Wyoming to oil drilling, and the Bureau of Land Management approved a copper mine expansion in Utah.

Trump removed another Biden-era air pollution rule that imposed stricter rules on pollution from copper smelters, curbing pollutants such as mercury, lead, and arsenic. Trump rolled back this rule in an effort to increase copper production and promote American mineral security.

November: No to COP30, Yes to Forever Chemicals

The U.S. government notably refused to attend COP30 in Brazil this year. The absence of any high-ranking officials caused climate negotiations to stall and climate finance plans to fall short

Meanwhile, the EPA released a proposal concerning perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). The proposal aimed to roll back Biden’s reporting requirements. The EPA administrator, Zeldin, claimed that removing these “regulatory burdens” would boost the economy.

December: Trump Suspends Wind Energy Projects

The Trump administration suspended five offshore wind projects on the East Coast, claiming national security risks. The move comes after a Massachusetts judge blocked Trump’s executive order restricting wind energy. Judge Patti Saris said that halting wind farms violates U.S. law.

In addition, the administration defunded the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) in Boulder, Colorado. NCAR is a critical climate science research center that develops and maintains research tools used by scientists worldwide.

In December, President Trump also announced a rollback of fuel efficiency requirements under his “Freedom Means Affordable Cars” initiative. Experts claim that the idea that these rollbacks will save consumers money is “highly speculative.”

The Good News

There are some silver linings among the climate chaos brought on by the current administration. The New York Times wrote in October that renewable energy was “booming” despite the administration’s efforts to slow renewables.

On May 30, the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) announced the Permitting Technology Action Plan. The plan should speed up and modernize environmental reviews and the permitting processes for new projects in the U.S., increasing transparency and reducing delays.

After the Energy Department terminated $7.6 million in clean energy grants, an internal watchdog began investigating the move. Many Democrats welcome this investigation, as many have claimed that funding cuts will increase electricity bills, threaten thousands of jobs, and hinder progress.

Individual states have increased clean energy efforts. Maine established the Department of Energy Resources, Oregon launched a heat pump rebate program, and Nevada is expanding solar access. New York Governor Kathy Hochul

Judges, environmental groups, and climate activists must continue to challenge the Trump administration’s policies and cuts. The climate will continue to change regardless of whether we choose to recognize it or ignore it.",https://fastcdn.impakter.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54932846014_becd05eda2_o.jpg?strip=all&quality=92&webp=92&avif=80,N,,2025-12-30 09:58:24.944953

CHARLOTTE, N.C., Dec. 30, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Duke Energy announced today its submission of an early site permit (ESP) application to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) for a site near the Belews Creek Steam Station in Stokes County, N.C., culminating two years of work. The submittal is part of the company's strategic, ongoing commitment to thoroughly evaluate new nuclear generation options to reliably meet the growing energy needs of its customers while reducing costs and risks.

Submitting an ESP application is a first for Duke Energy and a risk-mitigation strategy for the company as it pursues new nuclear generation options. An ESP is an optional NRC process that resolves environmental and site safety topics on the front end of a project and confirms a site's suitability for new nuclear generation. Having an approved permit reduces the risk of delays during licensing and construction if the company decides to build new nuclear units in Stokes County in the future.

""Nuclear energy has and will continue to play an essential role in powering communities in the Carolinas,"" said Kendal Bowman, Duke Energy's North Carolina president. ""Submitting an early site permit application is an important next step in assessing the potential for small modular reactors at the Belews Creek site.""

The ESP is technology neutral, allowing Duke Energy to receive the permit and select a technology later in the development process. The company's application includes six potential reactor technologies, including four small modular reactor designs and two non-light-water designs. Large light-water reactors, similar to the 11 units Duke Energy currently operates in the Carolinas, are not included in the permit application.

""We're taking a strategic approach to new nuclear development that allows us to advance licensing activities while reducing risks and allowing technologies to mature,"" said Duke Energy Chief Nuclear Officer Kelvin Henderson.

While Duke Energy has yet to make a decision to build new nuclear units, receiving an ESP provides future optionality for the company's customers and the communities it serves. If additional evaluation confirms small modular reactor technology at the Belews Creek site offers the best value for customers, the company plans to add 600 megawatts of advanced nuclear to the system by 2037, with the first small modular reactor coming on line in 2036.

The statewide minimum wage will rise to $16.94 an hour in Connecticut and $16.90 and California.
By contrast, 20 other states still follow the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour.
Michigan will have a new red, white and blue license plate.","Tourists celebrating the new year in Hawaii could become the first to be taxed to address the consequences of climate change.

In Utah, people who party too heartily — and get caught driving drunk — could be among the first to have their driver's licenses striped red with the label: “No Alcohol Sale.”

And motorists in Georgia could become the first to display their patriotism via the stylings of President Donald Trump with a special “America First” vehicle license plate.

The first of the year brings with it a variety of new state laws, including some that appear to contain first-of-their-kind policies, programs or procedures.

Here's a look at some of the new laws taking effect:

The first tourism tax for the earth

Many cities and states impose special taxes on hotel stays and vacation rentals. Hawaii will become the first state to hike its tourist lodging tax specifically to help cope with the effects of a changing climate.

State officials hope to use the proceeds from the additional 0.75% daily room rate tax for projects like replenishing sand on eroding beaches or removing invasive grasses similar to those that fueled a deadly wildfire on Maui in August 2023. Officials estimate the so-called “Green Fee” will generate nearly $100 million annually.

“As an island chain, Hawaii cannot wait for the next disaster to hit before taking action. We must build resiliency now,” Democratic Gov. Josh Green said while signing the legislation earlier this past year.

`ID please' — no matter your age

Utah's already strict alcohol laws are getting even stricter. As part of a new law intended to keep alcohol away from some people convicted of drunken driving, restaurants and bars will be required to check the identification of every customer, regardless of age, before serving or selling them alcohol.

People convicted of “extreme driving under the influence” — defined as a blood alcohol content of at least 0.16% or one of several other factors — must surrender their driver's licenses. Any replacement ID will bear a prominent red stripe on the front alongside the words, “No Alcohol Sale.” Judges also will have the discretion to impose the restriction for lesser offenses, and anyone wanting to shun booze can voluntarily obtain a red-striped ID.

“While this isn’t completely bulletproof in terms of ensuring that somebody that’s alcohol-restricted isn’t going to drink, it just makes it more difficult for them,” said Republican state Rep. Steve Eliason, sponsor of the legislation.

State-branded insulin for sale

California is targeting high prescription drug prices by getting into the business itself. It will become the first state to sell affordable insulin under its own label.

The sales come nearly three years after Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom announced a partnership with the nonprofit Civica to sell state-branded generic drugs at lower prices. The “CalRx” brand of insulin pens will be available at a recommended price of $11 per pen, or a maximum of $55 for a five-pack.

Newsom also signed legislation this past year that will require large health insurers to start capping insulin copayments at $35 per month.

A minimum wage tops $17 an hour

An annual inflationary adjustment will raise Washington's statewide minimum wage to $17.13 an hour, making it the first state to exceed the $17 threshold.

Others aren't too far behind. The statewide minimum wage will rise to $16.94 an hour in Connecticut and $16.90 and California.

Some cities will have even higher minimum wages. The rate will rise to $21.30 an hour in Seattle and $21.65 in its suburb of Tukwila, Washington.

At least a dozen states will have minimum wages of $15 or more, including new rates set by voter-approved ballot measures in Missouri and Nebraska. By contrast, 20 other states still follow the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour.

Patriotic plates for the road

New specialty vehicle license plates in Georgia will display an image of the American flag with the words “America First.” The plate will cost $90 the first year and $55 to renew, compared to $20 yearly for a standard license plate.

The new license plate gives people an opportunity to “show your support for President Trump and his movement with every mile you drive,” said Republican state Sen. Steve Gooch, who sponsored the legislation.

“No other state has passed it,” Gooch said. But “I predict other states will copy our legislation next year.”

Several other states also are introducing new patriotic license plates timed to the nation's 250th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence. Michigan will have a new red, white and blue license plate. South Carolina will have a liberty flag plate with the words, “Where the Revolutionary War Was Won.” Pennsylvania got a head start on the celebration earlier this year, printing a “Let Freedom Ring” license plate featuring the Liberty Bell.

“It was even more aggressive than we anticipated,” Michael Gerrard, director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia Law School, said of the administration’s attack on the climate.
And the Trump administration has shown it’s happy to go well beyond the letter of Project 2025.
Project 2025 called for breaking up the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, but not NCAR.
Trump’s attack on climate science and action has also created a permission structure for companies and other governments to backslide.","Calling 2025 a disaster for the environment and renewable energy would be an insult to disasters. For the climate, 2025 was the equivalent of taking one of those rivers polluted enough to stand on, lighting it on fire and then driving a dodgy Amtrak train packed with scientists, puppies and nuclear waste into that river.

Funny enough, flaming rivers helped inspire the creation of the Environmental Protection Agency in 1970. Fifty-five years later, President Donald Trump’s EPA has all but dropped “Environmental Protection” from its name, thus fulfilling yet another prophecy of the satirical news site The Onion and also the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025. The latter might sometimes read like bleak satire, but it’s actually a deadly serious playbook for dismantling the regulatory state to make life easier and more lucrative for polluters of all kinds, especially the fossil-fuel companies whose products are heating the planet.

When running to get back into the White House last year, Trump denied any knowledge of Project 2025. You might want to sit down for this: He might not have been entirely truthful. Since taking office on Jan. 20, his administration has diligently carried out Project 2025’s commands, executing hundreds of actions to undermine renewable energy, environmental protection and climate science at home and abroad.

“It was even more aggressive than we anticipated,” Michael Gerrard, director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia Law School, said of the administration’s attack on the climate. “Project 2025 seems to be a pretty accurate blueprint for what’s happening.”

The Sabin Center has been tracking the regulatory rollback and lists 293 discrete events since Inauguration Day that have undermined environmental policy. It’s a valuable resource, but it’s not complete. Another tracker, from the nonprofit group Climate Action Campaign, lists some actions the Sabin Center omits. And that list is also not complete! Bloomberg Opinion has sporadically been tracking these actions, too, including a timeline published in March. And we’ve found some events not listed in those other trackers.

To mark the welcome end of this annus horribilis, we’ve put together another graphic, which you can see below, meant to visualize just how extreme this year has been. The graphic includes just 180 of the lowlights, mainly for aesthetic purposes. But hopefully it still provides a sense of how Trump’s lieutenants woke up each morning asking Project 2025 and the fossil-fuel industry that is essentially running the White House just how high they needed to jump that day.

One big question after a year like this is just how much meat is left to be picked off the climate carcass in 2026. Quite a lot, actually. Much of Project 2025’s wish list has been fulfilled, including the essential repeal of the Inflation Reduction Act, the gutting of regulatory agencies and the erasure of climate science and even language from government literature. America’s climate clock has been turned back decades. But there’s still more work to do before we achieve “burning rivers” status.

And the Trump administration has shown it’s happy to go well beyond the letter of Project 2025. On Dec. 16, the 331st day of Trump’s presidency, Russell Vought, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget — and a Project 2025 co-author — announced plans to end the National Center for Atmospheric Research, the nation’s top climate lab. Project 2025 called for breaking up the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, but not NCAR. This is extra.

Trump’s attack on climate science and action has also created a permission structure for companies and other governments to backslide. Climate commitments made when the political waters were more inviting have been tossed aside at the first sign of turbulence. Even as they fail to meet their own temperature goals and watch tipping points like the mass death of coral reefs unfold, decision-makers worldwide are burning more coal, making fewer electric vehicles, softening their ambitions and shirking new commitments. Many justify this in the name of a false energy “pragmatism,” which promises everything will be fine, but we need just one more hit of fossil fuels to get by.

Everything will not be fine. Not at this rate. No matter what government scaffolding the Trump administration manages to dismantle next, the destructive fire lit in Washington is already spreading across the country. Americans will increasingly feel the loss of environmental protections, scientific expertise and new energy supplies at a time of soaring demand.

“A lot of what was done this year will come home to roost for people next year,” said Rachel Cleetus, senior policy director with the climate and energy program at the Union of Concerned Scientists, a nonprofit group that has also been keeping track of Trump’s attacks on science. “This is the moment where the reality of these cuts will become very real and put a lot of people in danger and the economy at risk.”

TORONTO, Dec. 30, 2025 /CNW/ - PowerBank Corporation (NASDAQ: SUUN) (Cboe CA: SUNN) (FSE: 103) (""PowerBank"" or the ""Company""), a North American energy infrastructure developer and asset owner, is pleased to announce a new 2.1 MW solar project located on a closed landfill in upstate New York, known as Phillips Rd (the ""Project"").

The Company secured site control on the Project in the form of a land lease and received positive results through its Coordinated Electric System Interconnection Review (CESIR) and now can proceed to permitting with local authorities.

The Phillips Rd project is poised to qualify for New York's Value of Distributed Energy Resources (VDER) compensation mechanism under Case 15-E-0751, with an estimated first-year average rate of US$0.0971/kWh. This VDER rate ensures fair compensation for clean energy delivered to the grid, reinforcing the project's financial and environmental viability.

The Project is also expected to qualify for incentives under NYSERDA's NY-Sun program and federal Investment Tax Credits under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 and the One Big Beautiful Bill Act of 2025.

Upon securing permits and financing, PowerBank will commence construction, with the project set to operate as a community solar initiative. This innovative model enables renters, businesses, and homeowners to subscribe to the solar farm, receiving bill credits and savings without installing on-site equipment. By feeding clean energy directly into the local grid, the Project offers an accessible pathway for New Yorkers to embrace the clean energy transition.

PowerBank's proven expertise, with over 100 MW of completed projects and a development pipeline exceeding 1 GW, underpins the projects' execution. Strategic partnerships and institutional-grade development capabilities position PowerBank to deliver reliable, high-impact renewable energy solutions.

The Phillips Rd project advances New York's path to 10 GW of solar by 2030. The State leads the United States in community solar capacity, having achieved the New York State Climate Act 6 GW solar goal in the fall of 2024.

There are several risks associated with the development of the Project.

Dec 30 (Reuters) - deliveries were expected to fall in the fourth quarter, as the loss of U.S. tax credits and rising global competition sapped demand even as the company rolled out cheaper versions of its best-selling electric vehicles.

The decline would follow plummeting sales in the first two quarters of the year when CEO Elon Musk faced a backlash for his political rhetoric. Third-quarter sales got a boost as buyers rushed to lock in tax credits before they expired in September. Still, Tesla is likely to report its second straight drop in annual deliveries, with this year’s decline steeper.

In October, Tesla launched stripped-down versions of the Model Y SUV and Model 3 compact sedan called Standard. It will face competition from affordable EVs made by Chevrolet and Ford, which are expected to hit the market over the next two years.

Analysts expect Tesla’s sales to recover next year, as the Standard versions, priced about $5,000 below previous base models, help the company defend volumes in Europe and Asia, where Chinese EVs are gaining ground.

The company is expected to report fourth-quarter and annual production and delivery numbers on Friday.

NORTH AMERICA, EUROPE SALES HURT

Investor enthusiasm in Tesla largely rests on Musk’s pivot to expanding robotaxis, producing humanoid robots, and improving self-driving technology in its cars. Still, EV sales generate much of its current revenue.

Tesla is expected to deliver 432,810 vehicles in the December quarter, down about 13% from a year earlier, according to analysts polled by Visible Alpha (VA). Another consensus of 20 analysts compiled by Tesla and released on Monday shows that a sharper drop of 15% to 422,850 vehicles is expected.

Tesla’s full-year deliveries were expected to be 1.65 million vehicles this year, down 7.8% from a year earlier, marking the second consecutive annual decline, according to Visible Alpha’s poll.

The fall will be driven largely by sales in North America and Europe, Deutsche Bank analyst Edison Yu said in a note.

MUSK MAY BE MORE FOCUSED IN 2026

The slowdown in sales has not dampened a rise in the company’s share price. Tesla shares rose over 14% this year, boosting Musk’s wealth. Facing criticism for running a cost-cutting arm of President Donald Trump’s administration, Musk has indicated he will focus on his businesses.

A recent court ruling cleared the way for Musk to reclaim a Tesla pay package that had been voided by a Delaware court. Shareholders in November also approved a new compensation package that could be worth roughly $878 billion over the next 10 years for the world’s richest person.

Delivering 20 million vehicles in total is a key goal for that pay along with other milestones on robotaxi expansion, robot sales and valuation.",https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/news/https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/trkd-images/LYNXMPELBT0DY_L.jpg,N,,2025-12-30 06:58:49.892864

With recent WOTUS rule changes being rolled out by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), questions remain across rural America about what the updated definition of Waters of the United States means for producers—and whether these changes could be locked in for the future. To better understand the implications, we caught up with Ethan Lane with the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association (NCBA) to discuss the regulatory landscape and the potential for codifying the new rule language.

Lane explained that the current situation is shaped heavily by recent Supreme Court decisions that significantly narrowed federal authority compared to past administrations.

“So I think it’s more complicated than that, and actually for once, to our benefit, right? Because you have the Sackett decision in the Biden administration, it really narrowed the scope when you combine that with the Chevron deference decision, the struck down Chevron deference. Take those two things, and you look at what’s possible in a regulatory space on WOTUS, and it is a tenth of what it was in the Obama years, right, and the original sort of scope of WOTUS.”

According to NCBA, these court rulings fundamentally changed the regulatory universe surrounding WOTUS, limiting how expansive future interpretations can be.

“We’re in such a different universe now. The Biden administration was forced to accept a definition that was much less expansive than they would have liked. That Supreme Court decision ensured that.”

Lane noted that the EPA’s current efforts aim to refine and stabilize the rule, rather than expand it.

“This is really an effort by Lee Zeldin, Administrator Zeldin at EPA, to button up that last 10% and make sure that this definition works for producers everywhere, that we don’t have anybody that falls through the donut hole on congressional intent versus legal interpretation. This should bring that to a conclusion.”

One of the biggest benefits for producers, Lane said, is reduced uncertainty across future administrations.

“And I think the benefit of that is in future administrations, there’s going to be far less room for them to monkey around with it because of that Supreme Court decision.”

He added that any significant expansion of federal authority would now require congressional action.

“They’re the ones that are now going to have to go get a statutory change in order to open up more room for them to gobble up more authority over farmer’s property.”

Ultimately, NCBA views the current moment as a positive step for cattle producers nationwide.

“If the enviros want to come back in and re-litigate this thing down the road, they’re going to need to go to the United States Congress and they’re going to need a statutory change to really do much in this space. That’s good news for producers around the country.”

“There has been this floor in terms of EV sales that has stuck,” said Zhang.","A 32 per cent year-on-year drop in zero-emission vehicle sales in the first three quarters of 2025 has sparked concern that weak EV demand could derail Canada’s emissions-reduction goals.

National zero-emission vehicle registrations, a proxy for sales, have been on a downward trend throughout much of the year, according to Statistics Canada, in stark contrast to the global upswing in every other major region outside of North America. Some Canadians see that as a sign that the country isn’t doing enough to spur adoption, while others believe Canada’s tough economic position requires a new approach to decarbonization.

Daniel Breton, CEO of Electric Mobility Canada, said Canada’s “topsy turvy” year shouldn’t be seen as a message about EV popularity. Rather, he said it has more to do with the U.S.-led global trade war and the abrupt end to federal EV purchase incentives in January, which the government has promised to bring back for months but have yet to materialize. Breton said some consumers are waiting to buy EVs and are confused why the rebates have taken so long to return. The industry association recently estimated that there are now more than 1 million EVs on Canadian roads, up from just 18,000 a decade ago.

“To say that the EV transition is not happening, or that Canadians are not interested. That’s false,” said Breton. “EV sales have slowed down in the short term, but the trend is there.”

Others think 2025’s EV sales dip could deal a bigger blow to the industry, especially with new ZEV registrations down 40 per cent in the third quarter. The Canadian Automobile Dealers Association has argued that it cannot meet EV sales targets set by the federal government, which are currently under review. Charles Bernard, the group’s chief economist, said some dealers are overloaded with extra EVs they couldn’t sell this year after consumers scrambled to take advantage of the disappearing rebates at the end of last year. Online car marketplace AutoTrader found in a survey in February and March that 42 per cent of non-EV owners were considering an EV for their next car, down from 68 per cent in 2022.

“Over the last two years, those consumers that really were looking to get an EV, they bought it when the incentive program was in full force, especially in provinces like Quebec,” said Bernard.

That mirrors patterns in other countries that dropped incentive programs. EV sales in Germany fell 27 per cent when the country killed its incentive program, said Baris Akyurek, vice-president of insights and intelligence at AutoTrader. U.S. sales are expected to drop sharply through the end of the year after EV tax credits ended.

“Now that we are going through what we’re going through macroeconomically,” said Akyurek, “consumers are kind of hitting the brakes.”

The EU has recently eased its EV targets slightly, and Bernard argued that the Canadian government should consider focusing on reducing vehicle emissions with hybrids or more fuel-efficient vehicles from Europe or South Korea, rather than just EV sales.

But Arthur Zhang, who works with the Canadian Climate Institute to measure the country’s progress toward climate goals, said it would be a missed opportunity for Canada to abandon the transition away from gas guzzlers, since many drivers could save money on future fuel costs by switching to these vehicles now. Other countries, like China, which saw EV sales jump 21 per cent from January through November, will reap those benefits.

“There has been this floor in terms of EV sales that has stuck,” said Zhang. “This is really a moment where we can assess: ‘What are currently the barriers for EV adoption? And how can governments reorient their programs to be focused on addressing those key problems?’”",https://thelogic.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Photo_Yorkdale_EV_showrooms-Toronto-May_2022-P_Justin_Greaves-TheLogic-1920x1280-1.jpg,N,,2025-12-30 07:58:10.550807

Dunamis Charge and DTE Energy Successfully Complete ""Communities in Charge Pilot Program, Expanding EV Access Across Southeast Michigan""

Detroit, MI - Dunamis Charge today announced the successful completion of its Communities in Charge (CIC) pilot program, a landmark initiative launched in 2024 in partnership with DTE Energy to expand equitable access to electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure across underserved communities in Southeast Michigan.

The program officially concluded in 2025 following the installation of 56 Level 2 dual-port EV chargers across 26 community locations, delivering 102 total charging ports at churches, nonprofit organizations, and community hubs throughout Detroit and surrounding areas. All charging equipment deployed under the program is Buy America, Build America (BABA) compliant, reinforcing a strong commitment to domestic manufacturing and resilient infrastructure.

Closing the EV Access Gap

Communities in Charge was intentionally designed to address EV charging deserts-areas historically underserved by public charging infrastructure-while prioritizing Black, Brown, low-income, and rural communities that face structural barriers to EV adoption.

By placing chargers at trusted neighborhood institutions such as churches and nonprofit organizations, the program expands access while building trust, awareness, and education around electric mobility within the communities most impacted by infrastructure inequity.

A Model Built for Impact and Sustainability

Under the program framework:

DTE Energy funded procurement and installation through its Charging Forward Commercial EV Charger Incentive Program

Dunamis Charge, a Detroit-based manufacturer, supplied American-made Level 2 dual-port charging stations

Host sites cover electricity costs while retaining the ability to generate revenue from charging sessions

This model empowers community organizations to become long-term charging hosts while creating a sustainable pathway for local economic participation in the clean energy transition.

Program Achievements at a Glance

26 community locations activated

56 Level 2 dual-port chargers installed

102 total charging ports deployed

100% BABA-compliant charging equipment

Expanded EV education, vendor experience, and workforce participation

Community Installations & On-the-Ground Impact

As part of the program, EV charging stations were installed at trusted community anchors across Detroit and Southeast Michigan, serving as access points for clean transportation and hubs for EV education.

Participating locations include:

Focus: HOPE

The Yunion

Neighborhood Service Organization

Covenant House

Greater Grace Temple

Fellowship Chapel

Greater Emmanuel Institutional Church

By placing chargers where residents live, work, worship, and receive essential services, Communities in Charge directly advances inclusive mobility and equitable infrastructure deployment.

Leadership Perspective

""We are incredibly proud of the partnership with DTE Energy and deeply grateful for the vendors and community partners who helped make Communities in Charge such a success,"" said Natalie King, CEO of Dunamis Charge. ""This program proves that equitable infrastructure deployment is not only possible-it is scalable. Our goal is to replicate this model nationwide so more communities can participate fully in the future of transportation.""

Vendor & Partner Appreciation

Dunamis Charge extends sincere appreciation to the installation and service partners whose expertise was critical to the program's success. Through partnerships with Edgewood, Income Power, Walker-Miller, and Detroit Voltage, the program delivered high-quality installations while creating hands-on workforce experience and supporting Metro Detroit-based suppliers.

Community Voices

""From the very beginning, the Dunamis team demonstrated exceptional professionalism and technical expertise. They walked us through every step-from site selection and permitting to installation and operation,"" said Bishop Charles H. Ellis III, Senior Pastor, Greater Grace Temple.

""They were attentive, respectful, and generous with their time. It's clear Dunamis is guided by a higher purpose in their work,"" added Linda Little, President & CEO, Neighborhood Service Organization.

""The service was top tier. The installation was painless and easy,"" said James Early, Facilities Maintenance Manager, Focus: HOPE.

Looking Ahead

Climate change was out.

In November 2024, five major U.S. newspapers published a total of 524 stories about climate change; in the same month this year, those papers ran just 362 climate change articles, according to researchers at the University of Colorado Boulder — a drop of almost a third.","Remember the climate crisis? The relentless, escalating threat to human health and safety that was once the main driver of clean energy policy?

You’d be forgiven if it’s all a bit hazy, given how swiftly the term was dropped from the energy-transition lexicon this year.

Starting on Inauguration Day, President Donald Trump not only eviscerated climate policy but completely upended the way Americans talk about energy. Though Trump seemed more concerned with taking down ideological rivals than helping constituents’ bottom lines, his new lexicon got a boost from consumer concerns about soaring energy prices that had people casting around for quick fixes. Climate change was out. Talk of ​“energy dominance,” ​“energy abundance,” and ​“unleashing American energy” rushed in. The shift was like ​“6-7” taking over a fourth-grade classroom: inexorable and irresistible.

The new terminology made the scene on Trump’s first day back in the White House, when he signed an executive order with a grab bag of fossil-fuel giveaways under the title ​“Unleashing American Energy.” A few weeks later, he used another executive order to create the National Energy Dominance Council. Both orders touted the country’s ​“abundant” resources.

Clean energy advocates quickly began invoking similar terminology in an attempt to shoehorn solar power into the new narrative. The Solar Energy Industries Association even passed out stickers with the phrase ​“energy dominance” on Capitol Hill as part of its lobbying efforts.

Some media outlets followed suit in deemphasizing climate. In November 2024, five major U.S. newspapers published a total of 524 stories about climate change; in the same month this year, those papers ran just 362 climate change articles, according to researchers at the University of Colorado Boulder — a drop of almost a third. (Both numbers are way down from the October 2021 peak of 1,049 climate articles.)

A number of Democratic politicians embraced the vibe shift in their own ways. ​“All of the above” crept in among leaders — notably New York Gov. Kathy Hochul and Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey — who wanted to signal they are open to the changing conversation, but not ready to give up on renewables entirely. In New Jersey and Virginia, Democrats Mikie Sherrill and Abigail Spanberger ran successful gubernatorial campaigns with hardly any mention of climate change; likewise, New York City mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani spent little time on the topic.

Most notably, Democrats this year prioritized the issue of energy affordability, an increasingly urgent concern among voters — and one that Trump is belligerently dismissing.

Two liberal groups, Fossil Free Media and Data for Progress, put out a memo in November that endorses this affordability focus, suggesting it’s a way for Democrats to reconcile the new discourse with the old. The memo encourages them to promote the benefits of renewable energy as a cheap source of power in 2026. The headline: ​“Don’t run from climate — translate it.”

Though Republicans are failing to reckon with the issue of soaring energy costs, there’s still something seductive about their energy rhetoric. It suggests an economy teeming with possibility, held back only by those meanie Democrats with their snowflakey concerns about climate and their insufficient will to dominate. The language implies there are easy answers to at least some of our woes. Worried about soaring energy bills? Unleash the beautiful coal. Concerned about grid reliability? Exploit those abundant energy supplies. Never mind that fossil fuels are most definitely not the cheapest sources of electricity.

The vocab shift, particularly around ​“dominance,” also captures a vibe that has always appealed to Trump supporters: ​“That language does have this bravado and machismo that is important to his movement,” Cara Daggett, a professor of political science at Virginia Tech, told a reporter for Grist earlier this year.

What vocabulary will seize the collective imagination in 2026? Likely, more of the same (though Trump does have a seemingly inexhaustible ability to surprise us all with word choices). The bigger question for me, though, is which version of this new nomenclature will gain the most traction in the months to come. Will the left’s translations catch on, convincing people that clean energy too can be unleashed, abundant, and affordable? Or will the fossil fuel–loving MAGA crowd continue to corner the enticingly muscular language of supremacy?",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/GettyImages-2224614127.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=7f8a55881cadf3ba981c9fff2f4287a9,N,,2025-12-30 04:12:52.959118

Several cases have been dismissed while others advanced through court systems, with some being considered before the U.S. Supreme Court in 2026. Critics of the litigation call it “woke lawfare” and an attempt to force progressive political policies through the judicial system.

Critics also argue the lawsuits threaten U.S. energy independence and, depending on outcomes, will have sweeping impacts on every American.

Here are some of those cases:

• Chevron USA Inc. v. Plaquemines Parish, La.: On Jan. 12, the U.S. Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in Plaquemines Parish, La., vs. Chevron USA. The case questions to what extent a state court can litigate against an oil company for its production of oil even if it obtained federal permits to produce the oil.

The litigation challenges activities of the oil companies dating back to World War II in some cases. Chevron argued the lawsuit was flawed, claiming that the activities in question were permitted, legal and often conducted under federal direction — particularly those tied to national security during World War II.

A Plaquemines Parish jury in April ordered Chevron to pay $744 million in damages for its role in the degradation of the state’s coastal wetlands. Environmental activists celebrated the verdict. It was the first of 42 lawsuits filed since 2013 by parishes across coastal Louisiana to go to trial.

The Trump administration’s Justice Department stepped in on Chevron’s side, urging the Supreme Court to move the case from state court to federal court.

Business groups and energy advocates warned the verdict will drive jobs and investment out of Louisiana. The Louisiana Association of Business and Industry called the decision “shortsighted,” saying it would “brand Louisiana as a state that will extort the most recognizable companies on earth for billions of dollars, decades later.”

O.H. Skinner, executive director of Alliance for Consumers, told the Center Square the case seeks to score large settlements from the energy industry and stop oil production.

“The case arises from a broader campaign of woke lawfare in which activists and municipal governments seek to use courtrooms to determine what companies are allowed to produce and what consumers can buy,” Skinner said.

• Suncor Energy Inc. v. Boulder: The nation’s highest court is still deciding whether it will hear arguments in Suncor Energy Inc. v. Boulder; a case to decide whether state and local governments can use nuisance laws to sue energy companies for activities that may cause climate change.

The case, originating in Colorado, centers around a city of Boulder and Boulder County lawsuit in state court against Suncor Energy claiming it misled the public in its activities that the local governments claim led to climate change effects.

Lawyers for Suncor Energy argue that allowing a case like this one to play out goes against protections in the Clean Air Act that prevent lawsuits from occurring against emitters from across state lines.

“Public nuisance can’t be used for global problems. It can be used for local problems,” Skinner told The Center Square. “That’s what it’s supposed to be used for.”

However, Skinner said many organizations that are pursuing climate change litigation are seeking to bankrupt energy companies with large monetary settlements. He said litigants will likely attempt to drain energy companies of their resources and use the funds to advocate certain ideological causes.

“These are highly ideological dark-money-funded, multi-faceted legal campaigns to bankrupt an entire industry and confiscate it for ideological reasons,” Skinner said.

• City and County of Honolulu v. Sunoco: Similarly, in 2020, City and County of Honolulu v. Sunoco was one of the first examples of public nuisance lawsuits pursued in a state court. The city and county of Honolulu filed a lawsuit in 2020 accusing oil and gas companies, including Sunoco, Exxon Mobil, BP, Chevron and Shell, of misleading the public for decades about the dangers of climate change induced by burning fossil fuels.

The companies asked the U.S. Supreme Court to intervene in the case, but the court, without ruling on the merits, declined to do so in January.

While the case is based in Hawaii, Skinner said litigants there hope it will have far-reaching effects across the country.

“They’re not trying to stop behavior just in those states,” Skinner said. “The thing that really freaks me out is how people in regular, everyday, real America are going to potentially be affected.”

• The People of the State of California v. Exxon Mobil Corp.: Going a step further than Boulder and Honolulu, California Democrat Attorney General Rob Bonta filed a complaint against ExxonMobil in 2024 for what he says are its contributions to “the deluge of plastic pollution” affecting the state.

Exxon countersued, alleging “Bonta and the U.S. Proxies — the former for political gain and the latter pawns for the foreign interests — have engaged in a deliberate smear campaign against ExxonMobil, falsely claiming that ExxonMobil’s effective and innovative advanced recycling technology is a ‘false promise’ and ‘not based on truth,” the American Tort Reform Foundation reported.

One of the foreign interests is IEJF, an Australian nonprofit that’s connected to an Australian mining company “that competes with ExxonMobil in the low carbon solutions and energy transition markets, ATRF reported.

Skinner said the litigants in this case are attempting to significantly reduce plastic use throughout the state of California and potentially beyond.

“That’ll make your average person’s life dramatically harder, and it’ll make a lot of things a lot more expensive, and it’ll make having kids, like, brutal,” Skinner said.

• Leon v. Exxon Mobil Corp.: Aside from monetary settlements, petitioners in this case are seeking wrongful death claims against energy companies for their contributions to climate change. The case stems from a woman in Washington state who said her mother died from heat-related illness due to the exacerbated effects of climate change.

She is suing energy companies for their alleged creation of conditions during a period of decades that led to increased temperatures on the day her mother died.

Skinner told The Center Square this case is one of the more blatant examples of ideology affecting the way a litigant pursues cases.

“I think they care because a death is worth a lot of money,” Skinner said. “The climate homicide cases are one of the more far-fetched legal theories I’ve ever seen, because you’re leveling this incredibly staggering charge.”

Climate cases will continue to move through the court system, with one to be heard before the U.S. Supreme Court early in the year.

Skinner is urging the U.S. Supreme Court and lower courts to rule in favor of energy companies across the country.

“We want the energy companies to win, not because they are perfect actors, but because the alternative is that our lives are governed day in and day out by woke trial lawyers, woke (nongovernmental organizations) and local governments,” Skinner said.",http://d14e0irai0gcaa.cloudfront.net/www.heraldstaronline.com/images/2016/08/19083717/fbLIKE.jpg,N,,2025-12-30 07:58:27.305225

The journey, undertaken earlier this year by three GM engineers, took them from Southeast Michigan to San Francisco and back, covering diverse terrains, climates, and driving conditions that cannot be fully replicated through simulations. The team used two pre-production electric vehicles — the Cadillac OPTIQ luxury crossover and the GMC Sierra EV pickup truck — both equipped with Super Cruise, GM’s advanced hands-free driver assistance system.

The GMC Sierra EV towed a fully loaded cargo trailer throughout the trip, enabling engineers to study how the vehicle’s range estimation system adapts under trailering conditions. According to the team, the real-time range prediction feature performed beyond expectations, accurately showing remaining battery range with and without the trailer attached.

The expedition was led by Tony Kraatz, a quality engineering manager, along with software engineers Max Schwinghammer and Chris Cline, all based near GM’s Warren Technical Center. Kraatz said the journey offered valuable firsthand exposure to real-world use cases, including navigation updates, trailering features, and Super Cruise performance in less predictable driving scenarios.

Both vehicles were equipped with advanced monitoring equipment, allowing the engineers to observe vehicle software behavior in real time. This setup proved crucial when the team identified an issue at a public DC fast-charging station, where the Cadillac OPTIQ was charging at unexpectedly slow speeds. Further analysis revealed a software error in the charger’s code, which was promptly reported and corrected by the charging network operator.

By the end of the round trip, the team had logged 2,987 kWh of energy consumption across 32 DC fast-charging stops, while Super Cruise was engaged for approximately 4,100 miles of the journey in the GMC Sierra EV, even while towing the trailer.

Meanwhile, although recent federal action has given automakers some breathing room with respect to the electric vehicle (EV) mandate imposed by California and other zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) states, regulatory uncertainty and other state regulatory requirements seem likely to continue to impose hidden costs on consumers for the sale of new cars.

Committee Hearing to Focus on EV Mandates

In his announcement about the upcoming hearing titled, “Pedal to the Policy: The Views of the American Auto Industry on the Upcoming Surface Transportation Reauthorization,"" committee chair Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) observed that the average price for a new car in the United States rose modestly between 2000 and 2010, from $20,356 to $24,296, but has increased sharply since 2010 and now exceeds $50,000. The committee has invited the heads of General Motors, Stellantis, and Ford, together with a Tesla executive, to testify at the hearing that will, according to Sen. Cruz, “examine how radical global warming regulations and mandated technologies have driven up the cost of vehicles for American consumers.”

Sen. Cruz also alluded in his announcement to recent legislative changes enacted by the U.S. Congress in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. These changes included the repeal of Biden-era emissions requirements imposed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards imposed by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) for model year (MY) 2027 and later vehicles. Meanwhile, the White House announced on December 3, 2025, that the Trump Administration intended to “reset” CAFE standards, claiming the prior administration “imposed unrealistic fuel economy targets that effectively resulted in an electric vehicle (EV) mandate.” In a parallel announcement that same day, NHTSA issued a notice of proposed rulemaking for amendments that would substantially reduce CAFE standards for MY22-31 vehicles.

Regulatory Uncertainty and State Regulation Impose Hidden Costs

While proposed changes to federal emissions and CAFE standards would give automakers breathing room, OEMs continue to face considerable regulatory uncertainty with respect to EV mandates. In early 2025, congressional Republicans invoked the Congressional Review Act (CRA) to reverse a decision by the EPA during the Biden Administration to waive the preemptive effect of the federal Clean Air Act. That waiver would have allowed California to adopt, among other things the Advanced Clean Cars II (ACC II) regulatory regime, which would have required the complete phaseout of the sale of new gas-powered vehicles in California—and other ZEV states that chose to follow California’s lead—by 2035.

California and a coalition of 10 states filed a lawsuit challenging Congress’s authority to reverse the EPA’s waiver shortly after President Trump signed the CRA resolutions into law in June 2025. Industry participants—including the Alliance for Automotive Innovation and the National Automobile Dealers Association, trade associations representing the interests of OEMs and dealers, respectively—sought to intervene in the litigation, arguing their members would suffer harm if the EPA’s preemption waiver were reinstated, particularly “in light of California’s threat that it will retroactively enforce the ACC II regulations as to vehicles already sold and as to model years already past, should it be successful in this litigation.” A hearing on the federal government’s motion to dismiss set for late January 2026, but in the meantime, the automotive industry must assume the increased cost of regulatory uncertainty while it awaits the outcome of the legal and political battle over EV mandates.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15875_2214.jpg,N,,2025-12-30 05:12:54.746928

West Virginia is one of 12 states and Washington, D.C., which are part of PJM.","CHARLESTON — Gov. Patrick Morrisey set a goal nearly six months ago for West Virginia to triple its electric-generating capacity, but the comprehensive plan is still in the works with a public comment period now closed. The West Virginia Office of Energy sought public comment and recommendations as it works on developing a comprehensive energy policy around Morrisey’s 50 by 50 energy initiative. The public comment period opened on Dec. 9 and closed last Friday. According to the office, 71 public comments were submitted by Friday’s deadline. During speeches in August in White Sulphur Springs and Wheeling, Morrisey unveiled his 50 by 50 initiative aimed at increasing base load electric generating capacity in the state from just under 16 gigawatts to 50 gigawatts by 2050. “This 50 by 50, that’s a needle mover,” Morrisey said during an end-of-the-year press conference last Monday. “West Virginia needs to be America’s energy state … and to really be a driver of America’s energy renaissance.” According to the solicitation for public comments, the Office of Energy said Morrisey’s 50 by 50 initiative will be an all-of-the-above energy, focused on traditional fossil fuel sources (coal, natural gas), and also include nuclear energy, hydrogen power, and renewable energy sources (wind, solar, geothermal, hydroelectric). The comprehensive energy policy being developed around 50 by 50 will also include a transmission plan. “It will address the need for sufficient electricity transmission lines and natural gas transmission pipelines to support the increase in baseload electricity generation,” according to the Office of Energy’s solicitation for public comment. “It will also recommend locations for the placement of natural gas pipelines and electricity transmission lines in locations throughout the state that lack sufficient access and in areas where access to increased supplies of electricity or natural gas will spur manufacturing or other economic development.” The comprehensive energy policy will include an energy security plan in order to protect against blackouts and other disruptions, and prevent potential threats to the electrical grid, such as cyber-attacks. This plan will include inventories of energy sources in the state and critical infrastructure; developing emergency protocols and coordination plans between local, state and federal agencies; and conducting tabletop exercises and other scenario planning. The comprehensive energy policy will also include 25-year strategic development for each source of energy in West Virginia. These plans will focus on expanding electrical generation, infrastructure expansions, economic development incentives, site development, legislation and rule-making, workforce development, education, financial and tax incentives, safety, environmental mitigation, and energy security. Since October, there have been several natural gas power plant projects announced that would add an additional five gigawatts to what is produced by the state’s power plants, including projects announced by FirstEnergy and a partnership between Kindle Energy, GE Vernova, Blackstone, and Wolf Summit Energy. Morrisey’s 50 by 50 initiative and the comprehensive energy policy being developed by the Office of Energy is focused on making West Virginia the battery of the east coast and making the state more appealing to energy-intensive data center and AI projects. House Bill 2014, a new law first proposed by Morrisey, is aimed at attracting high-impact industrial businesses and data centers to West Virginia along with microgrids to power the data centers using both fossil fuels and renewable energy generation. The rules governing these new data center and microgrid districts are still awaiting approval from the Legislature, with the Legislative Rule-Making Review Committee slated to review these proposed rules next month. “We’re going to be leveraging the intersection between energy and technology,” Morrisey said last week. “We’re excited about that and we’re going to keep going. We’re working on finalizing those plans. That’s been a big, big project.” West Virginia only has one natural gas-fired power plant that provides electricity to retail customers in the PJM market, a regional electric transmission organization that operates a competitive wholesale electricity market in the northeast. West Virginia is one of 12 states and Washington, D.C., which are part of PJM. The state has nine coal-fired power plants, with coal-fired power accounting for 86% of West Virginia’s total electricity net generation. In its public comment filing, the West Virginia Coal Association argued that existing coal-fired power plants should be prioritized as the foundational assets of the state’s power grid to ensure reliability and economic stability. “West Virginia’s nine existing coal-fired power plants represent ‘premium assets’ in this age of increased power demand and should serve as the fundamental building block of any plan to increase generation within the State of West Virginia,” wrote West Virginia Coal Association President Chris Hamilton. In its public comments, the West Virginia Chamber of Commerce advocated for a free-market approach that balances environmental stewardship with the practical needs of the state’s business community. The chamber expressed strong support for a diversified power generation strategy that utilizes both traditional fossil fuels and renewable resources to ensure grid reliability. “The chamber applauds the goal of the plan to develop new generation capacity utilizing a combination of natural gas, nuclear, coal, geothermal, solar, and wind,” wrote West Virginia Chamber of Commerce President Steve Roberts. “The resource rich opportunities that West Virginia has need to be harnessed for growth of the state’s economy for the benefit of all its citizens.” West Virginians for Energy Freedom, a coalition of groups that advocate for electric ratepayers, submitted public comments calling for any comprehensive energy policy to prioritize consumer autonomy and protections that protect ratepayers for bearing the financial costs for expanding electric generation. The group called for allowing ratepayers to purchase power from nearby customers, use of plug-in solar systems, and removing caps on net metering solar credit programs. “Without taking a position on the wisdom of tripling energy capacity in 25 years, we caution that, if West Virginia ratepayers or taxpayers would be required to pay for any of power plants built under this plan, there be guarantees and protections in place to ensure that the plants will be useful and beneficial for West Virginians,” the organization wrote.

If the city’s plan to eliminate the last stage of the sewer project is approved by the federal district court overseeing the consent decree, that rate hike would likely go away.
How far along is Akron in meeting the requirements of the consent decree?
The $265 million treatment plant is the final project, which Akron has been trying to remove from the decree for years.
If the plan is approved, the city will save hundreds of millions of dollars in the process.","Akron may be one step closer to saving nearly $230 million while still fulfilling the requirements of its water treatment consent decree.

The city presented a plan to the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency to update its Cuyahoga Street Storage Facility for about $30 million rather than build a new $265 million “enhanced high-rate treatment” facility (EHRT), the last step in the massive, $1 billion Akron sewer project.

“We have been able to successfully model to the Ohio EPA that we can and will meet our water quality standards due to the significant amount of work our Akron Waterways Renewed team has put into overhauling our system,” Mayor Shammas Malik said in a press release.

The city’s plan has not been approved by the state yet, but the state’s top environmental body has issued a draft change to the city’s National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) that allows public review and comment for 30 days.

The consent decree mandate has forced the city to almost totally redesign its wastewater facilities and processes to upgrade its 100-year-old sewer system, once notorious for dumping massive volumes of sewage into the Cuyahoga River during heavy rains. The new system has cost the city and taxpayers more than $1 billion, which is largely paid by ratepayers and long-term, low-interest loans.

This year, the city faced outcry about a planned $15 monthly rate hike, which will be implemented in 2028. If the city’s plan to eliminate the last stage of the sewer project is approved by the federal district court overseeing the consent decree, that rate hike would likely go away.

How far along is Akron in meeting the requirements of the consent decree?

Akron has made substantial progress in meeting the consent decree requirements, completing 24 of 26 mandated projects, with the Northside Interceptor Tunnel slated to be in use by the end of 2026. The $265 million treatment plant is the final project, which Akron has been trying to remove from the decree for years.

If the plan is approved, the city will save hundreds of millions of dollars in the process.

“We are hopeful that this potential change to our Permit will be the next step in eliminating the EHRT from our consent decree,” Malik said in the release. “At the conclusion of these projects, we expect to be capturing and treating 99% of all wet weather flows and annually keeping approximately 2.4 billion gallons of untreated wastewater out of our waterways.”

Rajendran, Simrin Sirur, Sandhya Sekar, Azera Parveen Rahman",,,,,https://india.mongabay.com/2025/12/tracing-the-evolving-landscape-of-green-jobs-in-2025/,"Green jobs are not new, but what counts as a green job is evolving.
Since Mongabay-India’s inception, we have been reporting about green jobs.
But, fewer than one in five people in the age group have a full understanding of the different career paths for breaking into green jobs, and what a green job can be, says the Global Green Skills Report 2024.
One of the unexpected places where we found green jobs was in the film and entertainment industry.
Awareness about green jobs is also uneven, and many aspirants don’t know what opportunities exist or how to prepare for them.","Green jobs are not new, but what counts as a green job is evolving. Typically tied to renewable energy or sustainability roles, the term now captures a broad spectrum of roles that contribute to environmental protection, restoration, or adaptation.

According to the International Labour Organization (ILO), green jobs are “decent jobs that contribute to preserve or restore the environment”, whether in established industries such as manufacturing and construction or emerging ones such as renewable energy and energy efficiency.

In today’s context, this definition encompasses everything from solar technicians and electric vehicle specialists to environmental engineers and jobs in climate finance, ESG reporting, and nature-based solutions. It also includes roles that may not seem traditionally “green”, such as community environmental workers or disaster management personnel, but are linked to climate resilience.

Since Mongabay-India’s inception, we have been reporting about green jobs. In 2017 we wrote about how India’s push for renewable energy will generate more jobs, particularly in villages. In the following years, we analysed whether the renewable energy sector would be able to provide the capacity of jobs needed for the transition away from fossil fuel jobs, we looked at the scale of solar energy needed to accommodate the shift from coal mining jobs and at how jobs in the decentralise renewable energy sector are projected to increase.

Almost a decade later, we are still talking about green jobs to document their evolution and the aspirations of the new entrants into the workforce.

By 2030, Gen Z (born between 1997 and 2012) will be a third of the workforce. But, fewer than one in five people in the age group have a full understanding of the different career paths for breaking into green jobs, and what a green job can be, says the Global Green Skills Report 2024.

In the mini-series we launched in 2025, we examined how green jobs are expanding and are not limited to the energy sector or to the discourse around transitions.

Green jobs now encompass a wide spectrum of roles from high-tech sectors to grassroots work and community engagement, ranging from highly technical to creative roles. With climate mitigation being one of the major trends reshaping businesses in the next five years, demand for relevant roles is likely to go up. Young people entering the workforce are also looking at this sector for financial promise and long-term job security.

While the aim for this series was to inform, we also wanted to inspire action and reflection. ‘Green jobs’ are more than a buzzword now; they are part of India’s climate response and future workforce strategy.

Finding green jobs in unexpected locations

In our story on how people are navigating the green labour market, we found that young aspirants are often inspired by climate goals but struggle to find clear pathways into meaningful work. Organisations are still figuring out how to define and advertise new roles, and training programmes have yet to align fully with hiring needs. Yet, there are pockets of support mushrooming to clear the pathways into this sector.

Going further into this series, we picked up certain areas of work that are not traditionally seen as “green” sectors such as renewable energy but are closely linked to disruptions in the environment and climate change. Our piece on an evolving workforce around disaster management showed how disaster response and resilience roles, typically a part of public administration or humanitarian work, are increasingly connected to environmental change and climate risk. These roles stretch from early warning systems and AI-based risk mapping to community counselling and long-term recovery. This story reminded us that green jobs can be both technical and human-centred.

One of the unexpected places where we found green jobs was in the film and entertainment industry. In an industry that is far from being ‘green’, a small community of people are working to scale the sustainability mountain. Former film professionals, engineers, and designers are turning entrepreneurs to mitigate the industry’s growing impact on the climate.

In the article on how reel and real stories create impact, we highlighted how professionals are carving out roles as sustainability consultants, renewable-energy advisors and circular-economy entrepreneurs on film sets. These jobs barely existed a few years ago and may not yet be part of formal hiring pipelines, but people are taking small, determined steps to reduce diesel use, reuse sets, and cut waste, effectively creating opportunities where none previously existed.

Who is being left behind?

The stories also touched upon access and motivation with regards to green jobs. In the renewable energy sector, for example, while there’s a lot of talk about new job creation, studies show a gap between the demand for workers, the available supply, and who actually gets the jobs. Awareness about green jobs is also uneven, and many aspirants don’t know what opportunities exist or how to prepare for them.

Gender differences also emerge when talking about what drives someone to a green job – men are more likely to cite the sector’s growth and rising investments as key motivators, finds a report on women in climate careers in India. Women, on the other hand, more often highlight concern for the planet, future generations, health, and personal experiences with climate change.

As this series continues to explore the various aspects of green jobs and their evolving nature, we hope it offers food for thought for new entrants to the workforce as well as people making a career switch, with a starting point to dig deeper and find their place in a greener, more resilient future.",https://imgs.mongabay.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/30/2025/12/29170926/AP25275619529125.jpg,N,,2025-12-30 01:58:20.098527

L&F's shares slumped early Tuesday after the South Korean battery-material maker sharply reduced the value of its previous contract with electric-vehicle giant Tesla.

The company's stock fell as much as 12% to 92,700 won, equivalent to $64.57, in Seoul trading, on course for its sharpest daily decline in two months. The benchmark Kospi was last down 0.5%.

L&F said after Monday's market close that the value of a 2023 multiyear contract with Tesla had shrunk to just $7,386 from $2.91 billion due to a change in supply volume.

Under the deal, L&F had agreed to supply high-nickel cathode materials to Tesla and its affiliates from early 2024 through late 2025.

L&F's drastic write-down of the deal value occurred amid Tesla's slower-than-expected sales of Cybertruck EVs and its struggles to boost EV battery production after the Trump administration ended U.S. tax credits for new EV purchases.

South Korea's battery sector has been hurt by sluggish demand from EV makers and battery cell manufacturers.

Earlier this month, South Korean battery maker LG Energy Solution said that its previous multibillion-dollar contracts with Ford Motor and Freudenberg Battery Power Systems had been canceled.

Another Korean battery supplier, SK On, also said it had ended its joint venture with Ford in the U.S. this month.

Released this month, the biennial report, known as a greenhouse gas inventory, is the first to estimate the effects of the recent federal rollbacks on Colorado’s climate action plan.
“In terms of our GHG emissions trajectory, the impact is not as large as I feared it might be,” Will Toor, executive director of the Colorado Energy Office, said in an interview.
Its trajectory towards the next target, a 50 percent cut by 2030, is similarly about two years behind schedule, at least for now.
While the rate of growth has slowed, annual carbon emissions have continued to rise globally, reaching another all-time high in 2024.","When Colorado Democrats took full control of state government nearly seven years ago, one of the party’s top priorities in the General Assembly was the passage of a climate action plan that would commit the state to the ambitious cuts to greenhouse gas emissions recommended by climate scientists.

House Bill 19-1261, signed by Governor Jared Polis in 2019, marked the first time Colorado had codified greenhouse gas targets in state law — and the end of calendar year 2025 is the deadline to meet the first of the goals, a 26 percent reduction in statewide emissions compared to 2005 levels.

Colorado will fall short of that goal.

That outcome has been all but certain for the last few years, as the state struggled to achieve the needed cuts, especially when it came to vehicle emissions, and state officials have previously acknowledged their efforts to meet the 2025 goal were at least a year behind schedule. The target slipped further out of reach this year as President Donald Trump’s administration and Republicans in Congress rolled back an array of clean energy incentives, including tax credits for electric cars and home heating upgrades.

Still, Colorado’s top energy official said he was “pleasantly surprised” by the findings of the state’s latest comprehensive emissions report. Released this month, the biennial report, known as a greenhouse gas inventory, is the first to estimate the effects of the recent federal rollbacks on Colorado’s climate action plan.

“In terms of our GHG emissions trajectory, the impact is not as large as I feared it might be,” Will Toor, executive director of the Colorado Energy Office, said in an interview. “What the latest inventory shows is that it basically pushes us back (another) year.”

That means the state now expects to meet its 2025 target — about 103 million tons of carbon emissions, a 26 percent cut from about 140 million tons two decades ago — in 2027. Its trajectory towards the next target, a 50 percent cut by 2030, is similarly about two years behind schedule, at least for now.

“There’s a lot of uncertainty about what the federal government is going to do in the future,” Toor cautioned. “There is a lot more work that we’re going to need to do to make sure that we are accurately capturing the effects of all of the attacks on clean energy … from the Trump administration.”

Colorado’s approach

Climate scientists have warned that to avert the most catastrophic impacts of global warming, governments around the world must cut greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030 and reach net-zero emissions by midcentury.

The world is badly off track to meet those targets. While the rate of growth has slowed, annual carbon emissions have continued to rise globally, reaching another all-time high in 2024.

Colorado’s emissions peaked around 2010 and had declined by about 16 percent from 2005 levels as of 2023, the latest year for which historical estimates are available, according to the new inventory.

Polis’ administration has embraced what it describes as a “whole-of-government approach” to climate action, pursuing a wide range of policies across different emissions sectors and regulatory bodies, including the Public Utilities Commission, the Department of Transportation, the Air Quality Control Commission and the Energy and Carbon Management Commission.

That approach hasn’t been without its critics among climate and environmental advocates, who warned as early as 2020that the state wasn’t doing enough to meet its 2025 and 2030 goals. Advocates have been repeatedly left frustrated by the scope and ambition of the Polis administration’s climate regulations, especially at the AQCC.

U.S. Senator Michael Bennet, a Democratic candidate for governor in 2026, on Dec. 9 announced a climate plan centered on a “cap-and-invest” program, reviving a proposal that some influential advocacy groups had hoped to enact through the AQCC after HB-1261’s passage seven years ago.

A separate report released this month by a coalition of Colorado environmental groups emphasized the need for the state to make “strategic near-term capital investments” to get back on track with its emissions goals.

“Coloradans see the impacts of climate change firsthand, in the form of more intense drought, more frequent wildfires and longer hotter summers,” Stacy Tellinghuisen, deputy director of policy development with Western Resource Advocates, said in a briefing on the new report. “Those impacts translate into real costs, but taking action — enacting forward looking policies to address climate pollution — has benefits for equity, for affordability and for air quality.”",https://kiowacountypress.net/sites/default/files/favicon-512.png,N,,2025-12-29 19:57:16.256495

Michigan saw $3 billion worth of disinvestment this year as companies scrapped planned EV factories or closed existing ones, according to the Atlas analysis.
Timelines and ambitions for numerous other EV and battery factory projects in Michigan have shifted amid the changing policies and market forces.
GM, for instance, sold its stake in a planned EV battery factory near Lansing to LG Energy Solution and the plant's planned opening has been delayed from 2025 to 2026.
And Ford has scaled back plans for an EV battery plant near Marshall, now slated to open in 2026.","At this time in 2024, Michigan was expecting a windfall of federal funds to fuel a transition to clean energy, along with billions of dollars' worth of green manufacturing projects subsidized by the Biden administration's signature climate spending bills.

But since President Donald Trump began his second term in January and began scrapping federal climate programs he refers to collectively as ""the green new scam,"" Michigan has seen a wave of project and grant cancellations, along with renewed investment in fossil fuel-based manufacturing and power generation.

Roughly $540 million in climate-related grants to Michigan have been canceled or held up since Inauguration Day, according to a national database compiled by Atlas Public Policy, while shifting market forces and the end of federal tax credits for electric vehicles have caused clean manufacturing investments in Michigan to whipsaw from billions annually in recent years to $3 billion in canceled investments this year.

""It certainly mirrors what we're seeing nationally,"" said Annabelle Rosser, a research analyst with the national firm.

Instead, Michigan automakers are scaling back and refocusing on gas and hybrid vehicle production — a trend emblemized by Ford's and General Motors' recent decisions to scrap EV production plans at Michigan plants and retool to produce gas-powered vehicles.

""That's just the way the market is shaking out right now,"" said Glenn Stevens, executive director of MichAuto, an affiliate of the Detroit Regional Chamber.

It's a trend likely to continue into 2026, as Trump administration officials continue their efforts to downplay climate change, deemphasize renewable energy and embrace fossil fuels.

Here's where things stand in Michigan as the year draws to a close:

Michigan has seen $540 million in canceled funding, with the biggest chunk coming from the Solar for All Program, a $7 billion US Environmental Protection Agency fund meant to expand solar energy in disadvantaged communities.

Michigan had been slated to receive a $156 million grant through that fund, while Native American tribes in the state were expecting part of a $62 million grant shared with other Great Lakes tribes.

Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel has sued over the grant cancellations, joining 22 other states to argue the administration ""unilaterally and illegally terminated"" the program, overstepping checks and balances to cancel congressionally approved funding.

Beyond the solar program, the federal government has canceled or proposed to cancel more than 20 Michigan grants ranging from $31.7 million to help LuxWall Inc. build an energy-efficient window glass factory in Detroit to $14,000 for a west Michigan climate resilience project.

Other canceled grants include:

1. $28.2 million for TS Conductor to build a high-capacity power line plant in Erie

2. $20.4 million for Ecoworks, a Detroit nonprofit that planned to convert houses of worship into climate resilience hubs

3. $20 million for the Inter-Tribal Council of Michigan toimprove energy efficiency in tribal homes

4. $20 million for the Southwestern Michigan Planning Commission to build two resilience hubs in Benton Harbor, upgrade energy efficiency in low-income housing and support a workforce development initiative

Smaller grants would have funded energy efficient housing in Kalamazoo, a climate change and resilience plan for the city of Flint and wild rice bed restoration in Michigan waterways.

The Trump administration has also frozen a $20 billion federal ""green bank"" network that had been expected to send hundreds of millions of dollars to Michigan to build and rehab housing across the state, insulate old homes and boost energy efficiency in factories.

Trump officials have signaled that more cancellations could be coming as they review tens of billions of dollars in clean energy funds awarded by the previous administration.

Michigan utilities, for example, are awaiting word on the status of $15 billion in clean energy-related loans announced days before Trump took office. And the Trump administration is reevaluating a grant program that awarded $500 million to retool a Lansing GM factory for electrified vehicles.

An exception to the administration's shift of resources away from Biden-era energy policies: It has continued making disbursements from a $1.5 billion loan authorized in 2024 to support the reopening of the Palisades nuclear power plant and in December announced another $400 million to develop two new reactors at the site.

""President Trump has made clear that America is going to build more energy, not less, and nuclear is central to that mission,"" US Secretary of Energy Chris Wright said in a statement accompanying the grant announcement.

Spurred along by federal and state subsidies and regulations that encouraged automakers to build EVs and consumers to buy them, Michigan manufacturers announced a collective $23.8 billion in new investments tied to the energy transition between 2022 and 2024, mostly related to battery or EV plants.

Fast-forward to 2025, and the trendline has reversed. Michigan saw $3 billion worth of disinvestment this year as companies scrapped planned EV factories or closed existing ones, according to the Atlas analysis.

Spokespeople for the US Department of Energy, which has overseen efforts to reprioritize fossil fuels by shifting federal resources and loosening vehicle emissions regulations, did not respond to requests for comment from Bridge Michigan.

But Trump has routinely cast EVs as a costly ""scam"" while downplaying the effects of climate change caused by burning fossil fuels like gasoline. During a December announcement that his administration would loosen fuel economy standards applying to new vehicles, Trump cast his pro-gas policies as a win for consumers that would ""protect American jobs"" and shave ""at least $1,000 off the price of a new car.""

The biggest EV-related cancellation is the Gotion project, a once-planned $2.4 billion electric vehicle battery plant near Big Rapids that spent years embroiled in controversy before state officials declared the project dead this fall.

In that case, Rosser, the Atlas analyst, said, shifting federal policies weren't the only factor.

""The rollback of the (Inflation Reduction Act) clean energy tax credits, softening demand for electric vehicles, and concerns about the company's foreign ownership are all likely factors,"" Rosser said.

This fall, battery maker XALT Energy announced plans to close its Midland headquarters and an Auburn Hills facility just two years after announcing plans to spend a ""double digit million sum"" expanding the facility.

Automotive supplier Dana Inc., which had vowed to invest $54.2 million at an Auburn Hills EV battery plant by the end of 2024, instead announced this fall that it would close the plant amid an ""unexpected and immediate reduction in customer orders driven by lower demand for electric vehicles.""

Fortescue canceled an under-construction $210 million EV charger, battery and hydrogen generator plant at the former Fisher Body site in Detroit, citing shifting US markets and policies including the loss of ""critical tax credits.""

Other losses included the closure of an Akasol electric vehicle battery factory in Warren and canceled plans to build a TS Conductor high-voltage direct current conductor plant in Erie using a since-canceled $28 million federal grant.

TS Conductor is still building the plant, but switched locations to South Carolina after receiving what company CEO Jason Huang described as a ""very generous incentive package.""

Timelines and ambitions for numerous other EV and battery factory projects in Michigan have shifted amid the changing policies and market forces. GM, for instance, sold its stake in a planned EV battery factory near Lansing to LG Energy Solution and the plant's planned opening has been delayed from 2025 to 2026. And Ford has scaled back plans for an EV battery plant near Marshall, now slated to open in 2026.

Stevens said he expects the EV market to grow in 2026, but ""it's not going to be at the acceleration curve that a lot of people projected, and certainly the previous administration was pushing.""

(Reuters) — U.S. natural gas futures extended gains on Dec. 29 to hit a three-week high, after federal data showed storage levels in line with forecasts, as colder weather outlooks and record liquefied natural gas export flows boosted demand expectations.

Front-month gas futures for January delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange rose 6.7%, to $4.65 per million British thermal units, as of 12:32 PM ET, after hitting its highest level since December 10 earlier in the session.

Gas futures for February, which will soon be the front-month, were up about 3.1% to around $3.99 per MMBtu.

The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) said energy firms pulled 166 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of gas out of storage during the week ended Dec. 19.

That was in line with the 168-bcf withdrawal analysts forecast in a Reuters poll and compares with a decline of 98 Bcf during the same week last year and an average withdrawal of 110 Bcf over the past five years (2020-2024).

""There is overall demand and if we continue to get cold weather, we could see those inventories drop even further. I think it's also reflective of the fact that we're getting cold weather and we're seeing record demand for exports,"" said Phil Flynn, senior analyst for Price Futures Group.

Meteorologists forecast a slight drop in temperatures nationwide through January 12, with Heating Degree Days rising from 398 on Friday to 412 on Monday, exceeding the near-normal level of 394.

Adding to bullish sentiment, average gas flows to the eight large U.S. liquefied natural gas export plants have risen to 18.5 billion cubic feet per day so far this month, up from a monthly record high of 18.2 billion cubic feet per day in November.

On a daily basis, LNG feedgas was set to reach a three-week high of 18.8 billion cubic feet per day on Monday driven primarily by increased flows to Cheniere Energy's 4.5-billion cubic feet per day Sabine Pass plant in Louisiana, which rose to about 5.1 billion cubic feet per day from an average of 4.9 billion cubic feet per day over the prior seven days, according to LSEG data.

Financial firm LSEG projected average gas demand in the lower 48 states, including exports, would fall slightly from 138.4 billion cubic feet per day this week to 135.8 billion cubic feet per day over the next week. The forecast for this week was higher than LSEG's outlook on Friday.

LSEG said average natural gas output in the lower 48 U.S. states climbed to a record high of 110.1 billion cubic feet per day in December, surpassing November's monthly record of 109.6 billion cubic feet per day.

""Production continues to be strong. If the cold weather doesn't impact production, then prices will stabilize. But if this cold weather settles in for a while, then it looks like we could push prices back above $4 for the February contract,"" Flynn said.

If you want more info If you’re dying for more details, you can download the official Rose Parade app here or here.","The electric vehicle industry has taken a pummeling this year. The Trump administration, as expected, reversed a whole suite of federal policies that promoted or encouraged EVs.

California's ability to require the sale of EVs: gone. Federal rules about emissions and fuel economy — being rewritten. Federal penalties for car companies that sell too many gas guzzlers: zeroed out. The $7,500 federal tax credit? Kaput.

Meanwhile, automakers delayed or canceled a host of unprofitable EV plans.

The all-electric Ram 1500 REV was canceled before a single one was built. The all-electric Ford Lightning was discontinued despite some glowing reviews. (Both pickups will be replaced with extended-range electric vehicles, which come with both a big battery and a backup gas tank.)

The buzzy Volkswagen Buzz is still available in other countries, but no longer in the U.S. The GM Brightdrop van is no more. The list goes on.

As for sales? ""It's a roller-coaster ride,"" says Stephanie Valdez Streaty, who monitors EVs for the data and services company Cox Automotive.

Sales spiked in August and September, during the last weeks that the federal tax credit was available, as buyers rushed to take advantage of the expiring opportunity. Cox estimated EVs hit an all-time high of 11.6% of the new vehicle market in September. Then sales crashed by 50% in October.

But here's a twist.

""Among U.S. shoppers who are in [the] market for new vehicles, the interest in electric vehicles actually ticked up a bit after the tax credit went away,"" says Brent Gruber, who runs the EV practice at consumer insights company J.D. Power.

It's the EV story you might not have heard this year: Despite the political and product planning whiplash, consumer appetite for EVs has been on a very smooth ride.

Overall, about 25% of new car shoppers are very interested in buying an EV, according to J.D. Power surveys. And with minor fluctuations, ""it's held pretty consistent,"" Gruber says, despite what he calls the ""turbulence"" of this year.

""There's still a tremendous amount of interest,"" he says. ""And from an EV owner perspective, we continue to see high levels of satisfaction once people do get into those products."" In fact, EV owners are 94% likely to repurchase another EV for their next vehicle, he says.

BJ Birtwell runs the Electrify Expo, a traveling festival dedicated to EVs. He says EVs have suffered from being politicized, with a lot of right-of-center Americans rejecting them out of hand.

""There's still a cloud of skepticism around EVs across some parts of the country,"" he says. But put a skeptic behind the wheel of a new EV, he says, ""and I'll tell you what I see: Smiles for miles."" Test drives reveal the cars are fun to drive, he says, and a little research can show that charging at home is easier and cheaper than they thought.

An American slowdown

Still, while Americans remain interested in EVs, it's undeniable that battery-powered vehicles are taking off more slowly than industry execs expected a few years ago. That's not just because of the policy reversal; it's also because of market realities. For example, while charging might be easy at home, it's a hassle for apartment dwellers who don't have that option. Meanwhile, vehicle prices — a challenge for the entire auto market — are even higher for EVs. Lower fuel and maintenance costs can't always overcome that up-front sticker shock, even for people who are hypothetically interested in buying.

This slowdown will have global consequences for the environment and for human beings: It locks in higher carbon emissions and air pollution for years to come.

The legacy automakers, of course, have lost billions of dollars on the EV designs they've canceled or postponed. But the delay hurts more than just the big-name auto brands. A whole network of suppliers sell parts to the automakers, and they also bear the burden when plans change.

Ken O'Trakoun of RPM Partners works with auto suppliers in distress. ""The whiplash,"" he says, ""between demand going up and demand receding, it has impacted a number of suppliers."" They made investments in factories to supply automakers for vehicles that either aren't being made, or are being made at much lower volumes. ""It's pretty disruptive.""

The ""ripple effect"" from those suppliers ""creates impacts on jobs,"" Valdez-Streaty notes.

Automakers, too, have laid off or reassigned employees away from battery plants and EV production lines as part of their adjusted timelines.

A clear global trend

But while automakers are slowing their EV plans down significantly, they're not giving up on them, either.

Partly that's because of the enduring consumer interest; as long as there's a market, the automakers want to serve it. And partly that's because the automakers are all global companies. They want to be able to sell to the rest of the world, too.

""On a global scale, internal combustion engine cars already peaked back, like, eight or nine years ago,"" says Huiling Zhou, U.S. EV analyst for the research group BloombergNEF.

About one in four cars sold worldwide this year was electric, Zhou says — driven by China's remarkably fast embrace of those vehicles. And China, increasingly, is exporting cars around the world.

That means that the global market for cars that run on gas or diesel is shrinking, while the market for battery-powered cars is expanding — and China is dominating it.

If automakers want to compete around the world, they simply can't afford to get off the EV roller coaster.

The Rose Parade is right around the corner, and thousands of people are already preparing to flock to Pasadena for the New Year’s Day festivities.

In its 137th year, the parade theme is “The Magic in Teamwork,” with Laker icon Earvin ""Magic"" Johnson as the Grand Marshal. It kicks off at 8 a.m.

Whether you’ll be camping out the night before, or heading over with blankets in tow in the early morning hours, keep in mind that the weather is currently forecast to be rainy. Yes, that's rare. If it does pour on the parade it will be the first time in 20 years and before that it had been 50 years since the last rainy parade day.

Here’s what you need to know this year.

Parade details and closures

The Rose Parade route lasts two hours, with its 5.5-mile journey starting at Green Street and Orange Grove Boulevard.

The floats, bands, and horses will head north along Orange Grove at a slow but steady 2.5 mph pace before turning east onto Colorado Boulevard for a majority of the show. It’ll then head north onto Sierra Madre Boulevard, wrapping up at Villa Street.

Police and city officials will start closing off part of the route to cars as early as 6 p.m. Wednesday, Dec. 31, through 2 p.m. Thursday, Jan. 1.

That includes Colorado Boulevard from Orange Grove Boulevard to Sierra Madre Boulevard, and Sierra Madre Boulevard to Paloma Street. So if you’ll be hosting viewing parties or are overdue for a delivery, Tournament of Roses officials recommend telling everyone to arrive before the closures kick in Wednesday night.

If you’ll need to drive to or through the downtown Pasadena area, you can use:

Walnut Street or the 210 Freeway for east-west travel north of Colorado Boulevard

Del Mar Boulevard or Cordova Street for east-west travel south of Colorado Boulevard

There will be limited crossing for north-south travel during the closure (see map for details)

Please note: There will be a 5K race at midnight to celebrate the New Year from Pasadena Avenue to Hill Street. Several intersections will close to cross traffic at 11 p.m. Dec. 31 and re-open at the end of the race event at about 2 a.m., including Pasadena, Fair Oaks, and Marengo avenues (see full list on map.)

Tickets

You can still snag grandstand tickets — we found ones from $80 to $130, depending on where you want to sit. You’ll need to have your ticket handy.

The parade is scheduled to begin promptly at 8 a.m. Organizers recommend that ticketholders aim to be seated by 7 a.m. In order to do that, you should plan to arrive in the area by at least 6 a.m. to give yourself plenty of time to work through the crowds and traffic.

Note that there is a ""clear bags only"" policy in place for grandstand seating at the Rose Parade, the Rose Bowl game and several other events. You can find details here.

Curbside seating and camping

Curbside seating is free, and lots of people will set up shop and camp overnight, which is only allowed on Dec. 31. If you’ll be bringing your kids or teens along, they need to be with an adult during the overnight hours.

You can grab your sidewalk spot starting at noon Dec. 31, but all your blankets and chairs have to stay on the curb until 11 p.m., at which point you’ll be able to move up a bit closer to the blue “honor-line.” Tents, sofas, unoccupied chairs, and boxes that can be used as stools or seats are not allowed along the route.

You can warm up with a small elevated barbecue, but it needs to be away from buildings and you have to have a fire extinguisher available. Bonfires and fireworks are banned, period.

Most importantly, don’t forget to drink water and dress for cool temps and the possibility of rain. (You can always sit on that extra jacket).

Given the weather conditions, it's important to note that the rules call for no umbrellas. The City of Pasadena advisers parade goers to use rain jackets and ponchos, which they optimistically describe as ""a great alternative so everyone can enjoy the show!""

LAist's Sharon McNary, a longtime Pasadena resident who has offered great tips on making the most of the parade in the past, points out this might be a very popular year for what she calls ""The People’s Grandstand.”

That said, Sharon notes ""it’s kind of a locals-only institution. Fans create their own little wooden seats that fit nicely into the notches in the stones lining the sloped wall of the 210 Freeway overpass over Sierra Madre Blvd. In the rare rainy year, they have shelter, and in the more typical warm years, they have shade. And they get to view the spectacle of the taller floats folding themselves down to fit under the overpass and opening back up on the other side.""

Parking

There is no parking allowed on the parade route, but you can purchase reserved spots. Pasadena recommendations include Sharp Seating, the city itself, and LAZ Parking. Parking at Metro rail stations are another option you can check on before you head out.

Authorities urge that you pay for parking in advance to guarantee your spot. Otherwise, parking is on a first-come, first-served basis and of course that supply is limited.

Once again: Arriving extra early is your best bet so you can avoid the traffic hassles and any unintended GPS glitches. Authorities warn: ""Please do not rely upon your GPS as road closures will be in effect and may not reflect on the GPS application.""

All parking meters are free and time limits will not be enforced on New Year’s Day, and overnight parking restrictions will not be enforced until 2 a.m. Jan. 4, according to the city. But keep an eye out for red curbs, “No Parking” signs, fire hydrants, and driveways, as the usual restrictions still apply. You don't want to risk getting your vehicle towed.

Public transportation

Where possible, public transit might be your easiest way to go, and Metrolink will be offering special early morning hours on the San Bernardino, Antelope Valley, Orange County, Ventura County, and 91 Perris Valley lines for the parade. (Note that Metrolink’s Riverside County Line is not running on New Year’s Day.)

From the Metro website: ""On New Year’s Eve and early New Year’s Day (Dec. 31 to Jan. 1), we’ll be running service all night on the A, B, D and E Lines with additional early morning service to help get you to Pasadena on time for the parade, which begins at 8 a.m. sharp."" Metro will also have buses traveling to areas near the route and Rose Bowl game.

You can find more information here.

These are the A Line stations in Pasadena that closest to the parade:

Del Mar Station (walk .3 miles north to the parade route)

Memorial Park Station (walk .2 miles south)

Lake Station (walk .4 miles south)

Allen Station (walk .4 miles south)

Metro will also have buses traveling to areas near the route and Rose Bowl game, which you can find more information on here

Metro is offering free fares on buses, trains, Metro Bike Share and Metro Micro from 4 a.m. Dec. 31 until 3 a.m. Jan. 1. For Metro Bike Share, use code 123125 on New Year’s Eve. For Metro Micro riders, use promo code RING26.

Accessible viewing

Three street-level viewing areas are reserved for people with disabilities and up to four of their guests.

Each of those areas along the parade route will have a section with audio descriptions for visually impaired people and another with sign language interpreters.

Tickets to all these viewing areas are free! But to request space, you’ll need to complete a form. The 2026 form is already marked closed, but for future planning, here is the Jan. 1, 2027 form.

Please note: no seats are provided, so you’ll need to bring your own arrangements.

There’s also limited wheelchair accessible grandstand seating sold through Sharp Seating.

Rose Bowl game

The Rose Bowl game, the oldest of bowls dating back to 1902, immediately follows the parade. The Rose Bowl Stadium parking lot opens at 4 a.m. Jan. 1 and the stadium gates open at 10:30 a.m. The game starts at 1 p.m.

A quick scan turned up tickets that are still available for the Indiana vs. Alabama matchup for a little as $130.90 and as much as $2,683.13.

General parking is available in certain lots at the stadium, with spots going for $69 that you buy it in advance.

For public transportation, you can take the Metro A line and exit at the Memorial Park station. You can find more information here about getting to the stadium.

Please note: the stadium has a clear-bag policy, which means backpacks, purses, and camera cases are not allowed.

If you want more info

If you’re dying for more details, you can download the official Rose Parade app here or here. You’ll be able to see the full line-up, maps, and get more information about the participants.

If you skimmed over the rules and your car gets towed on New Year’s Day, you can call (626) 577-6426 from 5 p.m. Dec. 31 until 6 p.m. Jan. 1.

A Medford-based solar power company blamed federal cutbacks from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act when it notified the state that it was closing as of Dec. 26 and laying off 109 employees.

Purelight Power CEO JD Beck filed a notification to the state as part of the Worker Adjustment Retraining and Notification Act on Dec. 23.

He said that 84 of the workers were based out of the company’s Medford location and another 25 worked remotely. He said 96 of the employees were laid off on Dec. 23 and the rest were laid off Dec. 26.

Beck said the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, also known as House Resolution 1, cut solar energy tax credits when it was signed into law on July 4.

“Before the enactment of the OBBB, the company had benefited from the Inflation Reduction Act, which had promised to boost federal tax incentives for solar energy for at least a decade,” Beck wrote.

Beck said the OBBB ""dramatically cut solar energy tax credits and significantly restricted the use of such credits.""

He also said the company had been facing challenges related to a prior merger, rising interest rates and increasing advertising costs.

Purelight Power said that it pursued selling the company and had three offers to buy it, but those weren’t accepted by the company’s lender. That lender placed the company in default.

The company said it is shutting down operations nationwide and will be filing for Chapter 7 liquidation. Purelight also operated in Washington, Idaho, Montana, Minnesota, Iowa, Indiana and Kentucky.","https://www.statesmanjournal.com/gcdn/presto/2020/02/23/PSAL/0b5ffdd3-ef45-4a2a-8e3f-bfa4d1671e16-2_MAC_Solar_panels_B55A9867.jpg?crop=3510,1975,x0,y1579&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-29 19:57:32.150371

Portland’s new City Council started grappling with the city’s climate issues as soon as councilors took office at the beginning of this year. One of the Council’s first acts of business in January was to establish eight policy committees—including one focused on environmental and land use issues. The Council was able to spotlight some underdiscussed environmental issues—like Portland’s relationship with biofuels and “renewable” natural gas—through this committee, though it’s unclear what, if any, changes will result from such conversations.

Zenith under the microscope

Zenith Energy was another major topic of conversation in Portland this year. Many of the new councilors came into office concerned about Zenith and other fuel companies based at Portland’s Critical Energy Infrastructure (CEI) hub on the Willamette River, which pose environmental risks to the city. Early in the year, former City Administrator Michael Jordan granted Zenith a new Land Use Compatibility Statement (LUCS), allowing the company to continue its operations in compliance with state mandates. The decision came at roughly the same time as several councilors began making moves to investigate Zenith and the city’s dealings with the company, displaying the limits of the new Council’s authority over Portland’s administrative branch.

The city also wrestled with Portland General Electric’s (PGE) plan to construct a major utility project in Forest Park. The plan, which would require removing around 400 trees from Portland’s largest park, was hated by many climate advocates, who said PGE didn’t attempt to find alternative solutions before proposing a Forest Park clearcut. After a city hearings officer sided with PGE to greenlight the project, opponents appealed. In the end, Portland City Council unanimously voted against the utility company’s plan—a relatively rare show of unity among councilors who don’t always agree, and a win for tree lovers dubious of PGE’s proposal. (Environmental advocates say it was also a win for species who live in the park, including Northern red-legged frogs. Portland’s frogs—real and inflatable—came into the national spotlight this year in other ways, too.)

River love

Portlanders gathered at the Willamette River en masse this summer, with weekly river parties demonstrating how excited people are to embrace a clean, swimmable river. After a hot stretch, the river saw a toxic algae bloom, making it briefly unsafe for summer frolicking—the climate crisis in action, folks. Luckily, a summer rainstorm disrupted the algae bloom, but advocates continue to emphasize the need to take action to mitigate the effects of climate change on Portland’s river.

PCEF continues funding climate action (even as Trump seeks to destroy the earth)

The Trump administration has done serious damage to climate action since taking office at the beginning of the year. Between clawing back funds for clean energy projects, firing federal climate researchers, and installing climate change deniers throughout every sector of government, these lunatics are really doing everything to hasten humanity’s demise. It won’t be enough to solve everything, but Portland’s clean energy fund offers a potential roadmap for taking action in the age of Trump. The Portland Clean Energy Community Benefits Fund (PCEF) just allocated more than $60 million toward dozens of local climate projects, ranging from electric bike incentives to energy-efficient home retrofits.

The convergence of renewable energy deployment, transportation electrification, and digital infrastructure expansion represents the most significant industrial transformation since the advent of mass manufacturing. As solar EVs data centers drive silver demand through unprecedented technological adoption rates, these three megatrends operate independently yet create multiplicative demand pressures on critical materials, with silver positioned at the intersection of all three technological revolutions.

The Convergence of Energy Transition, Electrification, and Digital Infrastructure

Global renewable energy capacity is projected to expand by 2,700 GW between 2024-2029, with solar and wind technologies accounting for approximately 90% of this unprecedented growth. This expansion coincides with transportation electrification accelerating beyond traditional forecasts, as electric vehicle adoption curves steepen across major markets. Simultaneously, artificial intelligence workloads are driving data center construction at rates exceeding 50% per decade in key regions.

The simultaneity of these trends creates what analysts describe as overlapping demand acceleration. Unlike previous commodity cycles driven by single-sector expansion, the 2025-2030 period features synchronized growth across three independent demand drivers, each requiring silver-intensive manufacturing processes and infrastructure components.

Furthermore, the silver market squeeze demonstrates how supply constraints amplify price volatility during periods of accelerated industrial consumption.

Strategic Scenario Framework for Silver Demand Analysis

Strategic scenario modelling reveals three distinct pathways for silver demand evolution through 2030:

• Base Case Scenario: Moderate policy continuity with existing renewable energy targets maintained, EV adoption following current market trajectories reaching 50% of new vehicle sales by 2030 in developed markets, and data center expansion aligned with AI deployment forecasts

• Accelerated Scenario: Enhanced policy support for renewable energy, accelerated EV adoption exceeding 60% market share by 2030, and rapid AI workload migration to cloud infrastructure

• Constrained Scenario: Policy reversals, subsidy elimination, supply chain disruptions, and technology substitution pressures reducing silver demand growth rates by 30-40%

Each scenario incorporates distinct geographic distribution patterns, regulatory environments, and technological adoption rates that influence silver consumption across industrial applications. Moreover, effective silver squeeze strategies can help investors navigate these varying market conditions.

Market Structure Transformation Timeline

The transformation timeline reveals critical inflection points across all three megatrends. Solar photovoltaic installations are projected to reach 1,735 GW global capacity by 2028, representing a 13% compound annual growth rate. Electric vehicle production is expected to transition from current levels of 12 million units annually to 35 million units by 2031. Data center electricity consumption approaches 1,000 TWh annually by 2026, representing 3-5% of global electricity demand.

These inflection points create temporal clustering of silver demand acceleration, with peak consumption periods potentially coinciding across sectors during 2027-2029, generating supply-demand imbalances that traditional mining production cycles may struggle to accommodate. Additionally, comprehensive precious metals analysis indicates broader market dynamics affecting silver valuations.

What Makes Silver the Critical Metal for Next-Generation Technologies?

Silver's position as the premier electrical conductor among all metals creates an irreplaceable foundation for next-generation technological applications. With electrical conductivity of 63.0 MS/m and thermal conductivity of 429 W/m·K, silver outperforms all alternative materials in scenarios where energy efficiency and thermal management determine system performance and longevity.

Electrical Conductivity Requirements in Advanced Applications

The superiority of silver in electrical applications stems from its atomic structure, which provides minimal resistance to electron flow. Silver exhibits 5.8% higher electrical conductivity than copper and 39.4% higher thermal conductivity than gold, creating measurable performance advantages in high-current and high-frequency applications.

In solar photovoltaic systems, even marginal resistance increases reduce cell efficiency by 0.1-0.2% per unit of resistance increase. This sensitivity makes silver's conductivity premium economically justifiable despite cost differentials. Modern photovoltaic cells incorporate sophisticated contact architectures utilising 85-95% silver content pastes, applied through precision screen printing and sintered at 750-850°C to achieve optimal conductivity characteristics.

Electric vehicle battery management systems operate at 400-800 volts with peak currents exceeding 500 amperes, necessitating ultra-low-resistance connections where silver's conductivity provides measurable safety and efficiency advantages. Tesla's Model 3 and Model Y battery architectures specifically incorporate silver-based connectors to manage charging currents exceeding 200 amperes while maintaining voltage losses below 50 millivolts.

Thermal Management Properties for High-Performance Systems

Silver's thermal conductivity properties become particularly critical in high-density computing environments where server processors operate at 200+ watts per unit. Silver-based thermal interface materials and solder formulations provide superior heat dissipation compared to copper-based alternatives, directly enabling higher processing speeds and reduced cooling requirements.

The relationship between thermal management and system performance creates a direct correlation between silver content and computational capability. Data centers utilising silver-enhanced thermal management systems achieve 15-20% improvements in processing density while reducing cooling energy consumption by similar margins.

Industrial Substitution Challenges and Cost-Benefit Analysis

Despite silver's cost premium, substitution barriers remain substantial across critical applications. Alternative materials face fundamental limitations:

• Copper: 5.8% lower electrical conductivity, higher corrosion susceptibility, increased thickness requirements

• Gold: Superior corrosion resistance but 39.4% lower thermal conductivity, significantly higher cost per unit

• Aluminium: 40% lower electrical conductivity, structural integrity limitations in high-current applications

• Graphene-based conductors: Promising theoretical properties but manufacturing scalability challenges and cost uncertainties

The cost-performance analysis reveals silver justification thresholds where efficiency gains exceed material cost premiums. In solar applications, silver represents 8-10% of total module cost despite comprising only 0.05-0.08% of module mass, demonstrating performance-driven value creation.

Table: Silver's Technical Properties vs. Alternative Conductors

Property Silver Copper Gold Aluminium Electrical Conductivity (MS/m) 63.0 59.6 45.2 37.8 Thermal Conductivity (W/m·K) 429 401 318 237 Corrosion Resistance High Medium Highest Low Cost per kg (USD) $800-900 $9-10 $65,000 $2-3

Solar Photovoltaic Sector: The Primary Industrial Demand Driver

The solar photovoltaic sector's evolution represents the most dramatic shift in silver demand patterns over the past decade. From representing 11% of industrial silver consumption in 2014, solar applications now account for 29% of total demand, creating the largest single driver of industrial silver consumption globally.

Evolution of Silver Consumption in PV Technology (2014-2024)

The transformation of silver usage in photovoltaic technology reflects competing forces: technological advancement reducing per-unit consumption while installation volume growth drives total demand acceleration. Silver content per photovoltaic cell decreased from 521 mg in 2014 to 111 mg in 2024, representing a 78.7% reduction over the decade.

This reduction resulted from three distinct technological pathways:

• Geometry Optimisation: Advanced computer modelling improved contact finger spacing and width, reducing silver usage by approximately 30% while maintaining electrical performance

• Silver Paste Innovation: Next-generation nanopastes and composite materials require 25-35% less silver by volume to achieve equivalent conductivity through nanostructure architecture

• Contact Design Evolution: Transition from simple grid structures to sophisticated designs including selective emitters and split busbars, improving current collection efficiency with narrower conductors

Technological Efficiency Gains vs. Installation Volume Growth

Despite remarkable per-unit silver reduction, total silver consumption continues accelerating due to installation volume growth rates exceeding technological reduction rates. The mathematical relationship demonstrates this dynamic:

Total Silver Demand = Installation Volume × Silver Content per Unit

When installation growth of 20-27% compound annual growth rate exceeds technical reduction rates of approximately 3-4% annually, total demand accelerates despite per-unit efficiency improvements. This creates a structural demand floor that cannot be significantly reduced through further miniaturisation without compromising electrical performance.

Regional Solar Capacity Expansion Scenarios Through 2030

Global solar deployment targets reveal the scale of upcoming installation requirements across major markets:

• European Union: 260 GW (2025) targeting 700 GW (2030) representing 169% expansion

• China: 420 GW (2025) targeting 1,200 GW (2030) representing 186% expansion

• India: 85 GW (2025) targeting 280 GW (2030) representing 229% growth

These targets translate into compound annual growth rates ranging from 20.1% to 26.9% across major markets, creating unprecedented demand for silver-intensive photovoltaic modules. According to Silver Institute research, ""silver demand is forecast to expand across key technology sectors, with solar photovoltaics leading industrial consumption growth through 2030.""

Policy Impact Analysis: US Federal Subsidy Elimination vs. State-Level Incentives

The elimination of federal green energy subsidies through executive order in July 2025 created significant policy uncertainty for US solar deployment. However, analysis indicates continued growth supported by state-level incentives and high electricity demand from expanding data center operations.

State-level renewable portfolio standards continue supporting deployment across major markets:

• California: State mandates 100% carbon-free electricity by 2045

• Texas: Renewable energy targets supported by ERCOT grid planning requirements

• New York: Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act mandates 85% emissions reduction by 2040

• Virginia: Clean Economy Act mandates 100% carbon-free electricity by 2045

These programmes, combined with electricity demand growth from data center expansion, support continued 14% compound annual growth rate for US solar deployment through 2030, despite federal policy changes.

Trade War Implications: Tariff Impact on PV Production Costs and Demand

Current tariff structures create significant cost pressures on solar deployment while potentially altering global supply chain patterns:

• US tariffs on Chinese solar modules: 50-60% (implemented 2024-2025)

• EU anti-dumping duties on Chinese PV cells: 17.5% base rate plus additional provisional duties

• Manufacturing reshoring initiatives: Policy support for domestic solar manufacturing capacity

These trade measures increase installed costs by 15-25% in affected markets but may accelerate silver demand in regions developing domestic manufacturing capabilities, as production localisation typically increases material usage during initial scaling phases.

This playbook represents a fundamental shift in mindset: from viewing resilience as a cost to be managed, to seeing it as a core driver of asset value, investor confidence, and long-term profitability. It’s the tool our industry needs to build for the future.”

Drawing on collective insights from 55 industry leaders across design, construction, real estate, finance, insurance and other sectors, representing a combined $2.5 trillion in market capitalization, the playbook offers a framework designed to connect stakeholders and facilitate risk mitigation throughout the development lifecycle.

“We recognized a collective need for a cross-sector resource that allows all stakeholders to work together and have more transparent discussions around navigating and proactively preparing for climate risk,” said Joe Rozza, Chief Sustainability Officer at Ryan Companies. “This playbook, which outlines best practices and supportive tools, is the most cohesive document we have at our disposal to evaluate joint mitigation options and decide the right next steps in creating a more climate-resistant CRE industry.”

The CRE Playbook provides actionable frameworks and practical strategies for identifying, assessing, and mitigating climate-related risks. It addresses physical risks, such as wildfires, flooding and extreme heat, alongside transition risks driven by regulatory, technological, and financial shifts.

“As a leading global commercial real estate company, JLL recognizes that our clients need actionable guidance to navigate the convergence of economic headwinds, escalating extreme weather events, and rapidly changing regulations,” said Janika McFeely, Vice President and Co-Lead of the Climate and Decarbonization Practice at JLL. “This Playbook fills a critical gap by providing stakeholder-specific best practices that demonstrate how forward-thinking risk management isn’t merely defensive — it’s a strategic differentiator that unlocks premium valuations, enhanced access to capital, and long-term market leadership in an increasingly challenging environment.”

“This playbook builds on ULI’s decade-plus history of helping leaders across the land use and real estate industry proactively confront climate risk and convert it into opportunity,” said Lindsay Brugger, Vice President, Resilience, at the Urban Land Institute. “By helping stakeholders across the real estate value chain assess and address evolving risks, this playbook offers a path to ensuring the places where we live, work, and play thrive long into the future.”

At the same time, CPV also completed its third solar tax equity financing deal with U.S. Bank. Marathon Capital served as the advisor, highlighting the project’s strong structure and CPV’s continued leadership in large-scale renewable development.

CPV Backbone Solar is built on land that was once a coal mine but has since been reclaimed and repurposed. The project includes 324,000 solar panels capable of generating enough electricity to power approximately 30,000 homes. By converting a former industrial site into a productive clean energy facility, the project demonstrates how brownfield redevelopment can support both environmental and economic goals.

Sherman Knight, CEO of CPV, described the project as an example of responsible energy transition. He noted that turning an exhausted coal site into a modern solar plant shows how engineering innovation and strong partnerships can overcome site challenges and deliver new clean power for Maryland. Mike Resca, Executive Vice President of CPV Renewable Power, added that Garrett County offered the right conditions for the project and that CPV is committed to supporting communities where it can make a meaningful impact. He highlighted that the project will contribute significant tax revenue to the county.

Carolyn Arida, Senior Managing Director of Infrastructure at Harrison Street Asset Management, said the project demonstrates how utility-scale renewable infrastructure can meet rising electricity demand. She expressed confidence in CPV as a long-term partner as Harrison Street continues to expand its renewable project portfolio nationwide.

The project was constructed by Vanguard Energy Partners, a well-known solar engineering, procurement, and construction firm. Geoffrey Fairclough, President of Vanguard, noted that despite the site’s complexity, the teams worked with focus and resilience to deliver a high-quality facility safely and efficiently.

Local leaders have also welcomed the project. Senator Michael McKay called the project an important step for economic development and job creation in Maryland. Delegate Jim Hinebaugh, Jr. highlighted that it brings new power to the grid while returning previously mined land to productive use and boosting the local tax base. Paul Edwards, Chairman of the Garrett County Board, said the project supports both environmental preservation and local economic value, benefitting residents and the region.

CPV Backbone Solar began development in 2020, with CPV working closely with community stakeholders throughout the process. As part of its commitment to local and environmental stewardship, the company is contributing $100,000 over four years to the Deep Creek Watershed Foundation to support long-term conservation efforts. Bob Hoffmann, President of the Foundation, expressed appreciation for CPV’s support and commitment to protecting the area’s natural resources.

The project now joins CPV’s broader renewable energy portfolio, which includes four operating wind and solar facilities and a development pipeline of 4.8 GW. Construction has already begun on a planned second phase of the Backbone project, which is expected to increase the site’s capacity to 175 MW once completed.",https://solarquarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/23-2.png,N,,2025-12-29 17:58:28.340249

A Monday statement from Environment America and the Public Interest Network highlighted a number of new laws aimed at curbing corporate polluters and enhancing consumer welfare.

First, the groups highlighted ""Right to Repair"" laws set to take effect in Washington, Nevada, Oregon, and Colorado, which give people the right to repair their own appliances and electronics without burdensome costs or barriers.

The groups lavished particular praise on Colorado's ""Right to Repair"" laws that they said provide ""the broadest repair protections in the country,"" with new regulations that will give businesses in the state ""access to what they and independent repair providers need to fix their electronics themselves.""

Illinois, meanwhile, will fully phase out the sale of fluorescent lightbulbs, which will be replaced by energy-efficient LED bulbs. The groups estimate that eliminating the fluorescent bulbs will collectively save Illinois households more than $1.5 billion on their utility bills by 2050, while also reducing energy waste and mercury pollution.

Illinois also drew praise for enacting a ban on polystyrene foam foodware that will take effect on January 1.

The groups also highlighted the work being done in Oregon to protect consumers with legislation mandating price transparency to eliminate surprise junk fees on purchases; prohibiting ambulance companies from socking out-of-network patients with massive fees for rides to nearby hospitals; and placing new restrictions on the ability of medical debt to negatively impact a person's credit score.

California also got a mention in the groups' release for closing a loophole that allowed supermarkets to continue using plastic bags and for creating a new privacy tool for consumers allowing them to request that online data brokers delete all of the personal information they have gathered on them over the years.

Whistleblowers from several government agencies have bravely stepped forward to expose fraud and abuse. From whistleblower clients receiving awards, activism on Capitol Hill, and fighting back against government abuse of authority, Government Accountability Project has remained dedicated and steadfast to the mission of protecting whistleblowers.

1. Bombshell Whistleblower Exposes Justice Department Lies

In June, Government Accountability Project whistleblower client Erez Reuveni exposed high-level defiance of court orders in the Department of Justice (DOJ) and faced retaliation. Reuveni was the Acting Deputy Director of DOJ's Office of Immigration Litigation when he made his disclosure exposing concerning details of misconduct and abuse of authority at DOJ. He detailed senior DOJ staff defying federal court rulings in immigration enforcement, knowingly violating court injunctions, directing attorneys to mislead courts, and retaliating against employees like Mr. Reuveni for refusing to carry out illegal orders. Reuveni was a 15-year DOJ veteran working under both Democratic and Republican administrations and was terminated for refusing to comply with orders from his supervisor that would have violated court order and his oath as an attorney. His story of protecting the rule of law has been shared around the world, and Erez Reuveni was hand-selected to receive the Pillar Award for his whistleblowing and bravery.

2. Preserving Voice of America, Again

In March, Government Accountability Project filed a lawsuit against Special Adviser Kari Lake and U.S. Agency for Global Media (USAGM) Acting Director Victor Morales for the unlawful suspension of Voice of America (VOA). Less than two weeks after the lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court of the Southern District of New York, the judge temporarily halted mass layoffs at VOA. The three named plaintiffs—Patsy Widakuswara, Jessica Jerreat, and Kate Neeper—expressed concerns of a ""genuine constitutional crisis"" in reaction to the agency closure. In late April, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia granted a preliminary injunction, reaffirming legal protection for VOA operations in the U.S. and around the world, and employees and contractors were notified they were to return to work the following week. Less than a day later, a federal appeals panel with two Trump-appointed judges issued a temporary stay of the lower court's order. The stay paused parts of the ruling that required employees to be reinstated and operations to be fully restored but did not overturn the case itself. Two weeks later, on May 16, roughly 500 contractors, roughly one-third of the agency, were fired from VOA. Over the spring and summer, the case bounced between courts, leaving VOA's future uncertain until a new ruling in September stabilized operations. Judge Royce Lamberth ordered that the agency continue operating as it had been since the spring, blocking USAGM leadership from carrying out another round of planned layoffs while the case continues.

3. Whistleblower Exposes DOGE Access to American's Social Security

In August, Americans learned that the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) put their social security information at risk. Charles Borges, then-Chief Data Officer at the Social Security Administration (SSA), blew the whistle on the creation of a live copy of American's social security information in an unsecure cloud environment that lacks oversight. Since DOGE's establishment in January 2025, its officials have been attempting to access SSA's data to address reports of fraud. However, a lawsuit resulted in a temporary restraining order from March 20 to June 6 stating they could not take this step during this timeframe. In that time, Borges' disclosure described multiple instances of DOGE wrongdoing at SSA by circumventing this court order. As the Chief Data Officer, Borges required full visibility into data access, exchange, and cloud-based environments. According to Borges, DOGE employees kept him in the dark and told his employees not to say anything to Borges. In August, Borges made internal disclosures to his superiors on the abuse of authority and gross mismanagement that posed a serious risk to public safety. In response, one of his superiors noted the possibility that SSA may have to re-issue social security numbers to every American if there was such a security breach. The day after his disclosure, Borges involuntarily resigned from his position at SSA, citing ""concerns on questionable activities"" and that the ""silence from leadership, and anxiety and fear over potential illegal actions resulting in the loss of citizen data, is more than a reasonable employee could bear.""

4. Continuing the Fight for East Palestine, Ohio

September marked two years of Government Accountability Project's investigation into the mismanagement and effects of the February 2023 Norfolk Southern train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio. Our team has worked around the clock talking with whistleblowers and residents, reviewing evidence, filing Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests, and more. In February, Legal Director, Tom Devine, published an op-ed in the Washington Examiner calling for collaboration between Congress and former-Ohio Senator Vice President JD Vance to assist the community that many believe was abandoned by the previous administration. This past spring delivered documents following a lawsuit against the Federal Emergency Management Agency relating to an unreleased unmet needs report, where an official was ordered not to engage with the local community despite this being the purpose of this position. The Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Office of Inspector General also published its findings on whistleblower Dr. Robert Kroutil's 2024 disclosure about the mismanagement of the Airborne Spectral Photometric Environmental Technology (ASPECT) plane. In its findings, EPA's OIG acknowledged the lack of clarity and miscommunication on ASPECT's capabilities but failed to address why the sensors were turned off during its flight to collect data. In July, on Whistleblower Appreciation Day, Dr. Kroutil was also selected to receive the Pillar Award for his whistleblowing and bravery.

5. Whistleblower Protections Climb on Capitol Hill

The push for better whistleblower protections on Capitol Hill has been strong this year. Coincidentally, on Whistleblower Appreciation Day, the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs unanimously voted to advance the Expanding Whistleblower Protections for Contractors Act that would strengthen protections for federal contractors. Each year, trillions of taxpayer dollars go to contracts, making it critical for those employees to expose fraud, waste, and abuse of those funds. This bipartisan legislation fixes the loopholes in current whistleblower protection laws. Government contractors aren't the only ones getting more whistleblower protections. Senator Chuck Grassley (R-IA) introduced the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act of 2025, which is cosponsored by Senator Gary Peters (D-MI). This bipartisan piece of legislation would grant FBI employees access to the Merit System Protection Board. The current legislative gaps leave FBI employees vulnerable to retaliation for blowing the whistle on fraud, waste, and abuse, and the new bill will close some of the biggest gaps in protections in the system.

One year ago, Executive Director and CEO, Louis Clark, said ""We are here for you if you are instructed to carry out an illegal order or if you observe gross mismanagement, waste, a specific health and safety threat, abuse of authority, or illegality. Let's sit down together and work out an effective plan of action to address the wrongdoing once we have verified your concerns."" His statement still holds true. Government Accountability Project is here through the good and bad times, the natural ebb and flow of politics. Thank you for your continued support and allyship this year and beyond.",https://whistleblower.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-in-Review-X.png,N,,2025-12-29 16:57:58.582727

In contrast, 80% of the 10 states with the lowest electricity prices are reliably red.
New York is a prime blue state example, where electricity prices were 58% higher than the national average during the same period.
Ultimately, it’s up to the states to prioritize reliable, affordable, dispatchable generation and drive down electricity prices.
Tom Pyle is President of the Institute for Energy Research, a nonprofit energy research organization.","Americans are anxious about their utility bills – and with good reason. Three quarters of U.S. residents are concerned about their electricity and gas bills rising this year, and 80% feel powerless over how much they are charged for utilities. For nearly two-thirds of U.S. billpayers, simply keeping the lights on has become a growing source of financial stress.

Those concerns are grounded in reality. U.S. electricity prices rose 27% during the Biden administration and another 11% between January and September 2025. Yet despite a national narrative eager to blame President Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), the real drivers of high electricity prices are far closer to home.

Electricity affordability is shaped primarily by state policy choices, and states choosing the most expensive path are overwhelmingly blue. So, blue-state residents are experiencing the pain much more than those in red states.

A new report from Always On Energy Research and the Institute for Energy Research finds that 86% of states with electricity prices above the national average voted for Democratic presidential candidates in 2020 and 2024. In contrast, 80% of the 10 states with the lowest electricity prices are reliably red. That’s not a coincidence. Those high prices reflect a consistent pattern of state-level energy policies that dictate emissions reduction targets at the expense of affordability, reliability, and physics.

States have the exclusive power to decide which resources supply their grids under the Federal Power Act. Governors, legislatures, and public utility commissions – not the White House – decide whether to impose renewable portfolio standards (RPS), enforce Net-Zero mandates, or prematurely retire reliable power plants. Those decisions directly determine how much families and businesses pay for electricity.

Today, 28 states enforce an RPS, requiring a certain percentage of retail electricity sales to come from renewable sources, and 16 states have 100% clean energy standards (CES) or carbon-free mandates. Many of these policies compel utilities to overbuild intermittent generation, such as wind and solar, thereby requiring significant investments in transmission, grid-scale storage, and backup generation to maintain reliability. The result is a higher total system cost, which is passed onto ratepayers in the form of higher electricity rates.

Consider that the U.S. average electricity price between January 2025 and August 2025 was 13.54 cents per kilowatt-hour. Each of the five most expensive states mandates 100% of their electricity come from renewable or carbon-free sources in the coming decades. Eight of the 10 states with the lowest electricity prices voted for the Republican presidential candidate in 2020 and 2024, and seven of the 10 don’t have renewable or carbon-free mandates.

New York is a prime blue state example, where electricity prices were 58% higher than the national average during the same period. The Progressive Policy Institute (PPI) found that New York experienced the second-fastest increase in electricity prices nationwide, with residential customers suffering a 36% increase between 2019 and 2024. PPI points to “the immense capital investment required to transform the grid and specific policy choices that increase the cost of energy production,” as well as the closure of the Indian Point nuclear plant.

It’s clear that Governor Kathy Hochul knows exactly which policy choices are driving up electricity costs — because she’s scrambling to roll them back. Ms. Hochul has delayed implementation of the state’s cap-and-tax mandates under the 2019 Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act (CLCPA), which includes a substantial renewable energy mandate requiring 70% renewable energy by 2030 and 100% carbon-free energy by 2040.

The state’s Department of Environmental Conservation defended the delay, arguing in court that the regulations would impose “extraordinary and damaging costs upon New Yorkers.” Ms. Hochul has approved two major natural gas pipelines and delayed implementation of the state’s ban on gas stoves in new buildings – a tacit admission that reliability and affordability still matter in New York.

California, however, remains committed to the most expensive path in the country with the fastest rate increase, now double the national average. For years, Governor Gavin Newsom and the California legislature have imposed on ratepayers a carbon-emissions reduction mandate, renewable mandates, solar cost-shifting through net metering, nuclear reactor closures, and EV charging subsidies.

For all of his climate-friendly posturing, Mr. Newsom signed a bill to ramp up oil drilling in Kern County, and his Energy Commission has delayed its plan to penalize refinery profits for five years. These reversals underscore a central truth: ideology will take a back seat to cost and reliability.

There’s a silver lining, however. While states can choose to raise electricity costs for their residents through bad policies, they can also choose to lower costs through good policies. For instance, Florida is the second-largest electricity producer in the country, behind only Texas. Residents require air conditioning for its hot, humid summers and heating in its mild winters. However, Florida delivers electricity at prices 2% below the U.S. average—mainly because it generates 75% of its power from imported natural gas. It has avoided aggressive climate mandates and delivers below-average electricity prices despite frequent hurricanes that require ongoing investment in the grid.

Louisiana and Kentucky have also invested in wise policies. Louisiana posted the third-lowest electricity rates in the U.S. in 2025, and Kentucky had the lowest rates east of the Mississippi River. Nearly three-quarters of Louisiana’s electricity is generated from natural gas, leveraging its abundant natural gas production and robust pipeline network. Kentucky, similarly, leverages its coal resources to generate 67% of the state’s electricity, with another 26% by natural gas. Neither has pursued aggressive carbon emissions reduction or renewable energy mandates.

Pinning the blame on the federal government and President Trump, as Democrats have been eager to do, ignores the vital role that states play in delivering affordable, reliable electricity. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright recognizes the same, stating on Fox News that “Electricity prices have risen very fast in blue states with restrictive renewable portfolio standards.”

The Department of Energy and President Trump can set the tone, but they don’t dictate the composition of state grids or the bills consumers receive each month. Those decisions rest squarely with governors, legislators, and regulators. Ultimately, it’s up to the states to prioritize reliable, affordable, dispatchable generation and drive down electricity prices.

High electricity rates aren’t an unavoidable consequence of modern life or federal policy. They are the predictable outcome of state-level choices that ignore reliability, undervalue dispatchable generation, and impose rigid mandates regardless of cost. Americans deserve leaders who recognize that keeping the lights on at a modest price isn’t optional. The states keeping electricity affordable today offer a roadmap for those willing to learn.

How California’s first push to regulate data centers slipped away California’s bid to bring more oversight to data centers unraveled earlier this year under industry pressure, ending with Gov.
Early in the session, Padilla put a separate clean-power incentives proposal for data centers on hold until 2026.

Tools that power artificial intelligence devour energy. But attempts to shield regular Californians from footing the bill in 2025 ended with a law requiring regulators to write a report about the issue by 2027.

If that sounds pretty watered down, it is. Efforts to regulate the energy usage of data centers — the beating heart of AI — ran headlong into Big Tech, business groups and the governor.

That’s not surprising given that California is increasingly dependent on big tech for state revenue: A handful of companies pay upwards of $5 billion just on income tax withholding.

The law mandating the report is the lone survivor of last year’s push to rein in the data-center industry. Its deadline means the findings won’t likely be ready in time for lawmakers to use in 2026. The measure began as a plan to give data centers their own electricity rate, shielding households and small businesses from higher bills.

It amounts to a “toothless” measure, directing the utility regulator to study an issue it already has the authority to investigate, said Matthew Freedman, a staff attorney with the Utility Reform Network, a ratepayer advocate.

Data centers’ enormous electricity demand has pushed them to the center of California’s energy debate, and that’s why lawmakers and consumer advocates say new regulations matter.

For instance, the sheer amount of energy requested by data centers in California is prompting questions about costly grid upgrades even as speculative projects and fast-shifting AI loads make long-term planning uncertain. Developers have requested 18.7 gigawatts of service capacity for data centers, more than enough to serve every household in the state, according to the California Energy Commission.

But the report could help shape future debates as lawmakers revisit tougher rules and the CPUC considers new policies on what data centers pay for power — a discussion gaining urgency as scrutiny of their rising electricity costs grows, he said.

“It could be that the report helps the Legislature to understand the magnitude of the problem and potential solutions,” Freedman said. “It could also inform the CPUC’s own review of the reasonableness of rates for data center customers, which they are likely to investigate.”

State Sen. Steve Padilla, a Democrat from Chula Vista, says that the final version of his law “was not the one we would have preferred,” agreeing that it may seem “obvious” the CPUC can study data center cost impacts. The measure could help frame future debates and at least “says unequivocally that the CPUC has the authority to study these impacts” as demand from data centers accelerates, Padilla added.

Data centers ""consume huge amounts of energy, huge amounts of resources, and at least in the near future, we're not going to see that change,” he said.

Earlier drafts of Padilla’s measure went further, requiring data centers to install large batteries to support the grid during peak demand and pushing utilities to supply them with 100% carbon-free electricity by 2030 — years ahead of the state’s own mandate. Those provisions were ultimately stripped out.

How California’s first push to regulate data centers slipped away

California’s bid to bring more oversight to data centers unraveled earlier this year under industry pressure, ending with Gov. Gavin Newsom’s veto of a bill requiring operators to report their water use. Concerns over the bills reflected fears that data-center developers could shift projects to other states and take valuable jobs with them.

A September Stanford report on powering California data centers said the state risks losing property-tax revenue, union construction jobs and “valuable AI talent” if data-center construction moves out of state.

The idea that increased regulation could lead to businesses or dollars in some form leaving California is an argument that has been brought up across industries for decades. It often does not hold up to more careful or long-term scrutiny.

In the face of this opposition, two key proposals stalled in the Legislature’s procedural churn. Early in the session, Padilla put a separate clean-power incentives proposal for data centers on hold until 2026. Later in the year, an Assembly bill requiring data centers to disclose their electricity use was placed in the Senate’s suspense file — where appropriations committees often quietly halt measures.

Newsom, who has often spoken of California’s AI dominance, echoed the industry’s competitiveness worries in his veto message of the water-use reporting requirement. The governor said he was reluctant to impose requirements on data centers, “without understanding the full impact on businesses and the consumers of their technology.”

Despite last year’s defeats, some lawmakers say they will attempt to tackle the issue again.

Padilla plans to try again with a bill that would add new rules on who pays for data centers’ long-term grid costs in California, while Assemblymember Rebecca Bauer-Kahan — a Democrat from San Ramon — will revisit her electricity-disclosure bill.

Big Tech warns of job losses but one advocate sees an opening

After blocking most measures — and watering down the lone energy-costs bill — Big Tech groups say they’ll revive arguments that new efforts to regulate data centers could cost California jobs.

At a CalMatters event in November, Silicon Valley Leadership Group CEO Ahmad Thomas argued that California must compete to attract investments like the $40 billion data-center project Texas secured with Google. Any policy making deals like that tougher would provoke conflict, he added.

“When we get to the details of what our regulatory regime looks like versus other states, or how we can make California more competitive ... that's where sometimes we struggle to find that happy medium,” he said.

Despite having more regulations than some states, California continues to toggle between the 4th and 5th largest economy in the world and has for some time, suggesting that the Golden State is very competitive.

Dan Diorio, vice president of state policy for the Data Center Coalition, another industry lobbying group, said new requirements on data centers should apply to all other large electricity users.

“To single out one industry is not something that we think would set a helpful precedent, ” Diorio said. “We've been very consistent with that throughout the country.”

Critics say job loss fears are overblown, noting California built its AI sector without the massive hyperscale facilities that typically gravitate to states with ample, cheaper land and streamlined permitting.

Data-center locations — driven by energy prices, land and local rules — have little to do with where AI researchers live, said Shaolei Ren, an AI researcher at UC Riverside.

“These two things are sort of separate, they’re decoupled,” he said.

Freedman, of TURN, said lawmakers may have a bargaining chip: If developers cared about cheaper power, they wouldn’t be proposing facilities in a state with high electric rates. That means speed and certainty may be the priority, giving lawmakers the space to potentially offer quicker approvals in exchange for developers covering more grid costs.

“There's so much money in this business that the energy bills — even though large — are kind of like rounding errors for these guys,” Freedman said. “If that's true, then maybe they shouldn't care about having to pay a little bit more to ensure that costs aren't being shifted to other customers.”

It wasn't until a couple of years ago that Keri Rodrigues began to worry about how her kids might be using chatbots. She learned her youngest son was interacting with the chatbot in his Bible app — he was asking it some deep moral questions, about sin for instance.

That's the kind of conversation that she had hoped her son would have with her and not a computer. ""Not everything in life is black and white,"" she says. ""There are grays. And it's my job as his mom to help him navigate that and walk through it, right?""

Rodrigues has also been hearing from parents across the country who are concerned about AI chatbots' influence on their children. She is the president of the National Parents Union, which advocates for children and families. Many parents, she says, are watching chatbots claim to be their kids' best friends, encouraging children to tell them everything.

Psychologists and online safety advocates say parents are right to be worried. Extended chatbot interactions may affect kids' social development and mental health, they say. And the technology is changing so fast that few safeguards are in place.

The impacts can be serious. According to their parents' testimonies at a recent Senate hearing, two teens died by suicide after prolonged interactions with chatbots that encouraged their suicide plans.

If you or someone you know may be considering suicide or be in crisis, call or text 988 to reach the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline.

But generative AI chatbots are a growing part of life for American teens. A survey by the Pew Research Center found that 64% of adolescents are using chatbots, with 3 in 10 saying they use them daily.

""It's a very new technology,"" says Dr. Jason Nagata, a pediatrician and researcher of adolescent digital media use at the University of California San Francisco. ""It's ever-changing and there's not really best practices for youth yet. So, I think there are more opportunities now for risks because we're still kind of guinea pigs in the whole process.""

And teenagers are particularly vulnerable to the risks of chatbots, he adds, because adolescence is a time of rapid brain development, which is shaped by experiences. ""It is a period when teens are more vulnerable to lots of different exposures, whether it's peers or computers.""

But parents can minimize those risks, say pediatricians and psychologists. Here are some ways to help teens navigate the technology safely.

1. Be aware of the risks

A new report from the online safety company, Aura, shows that 42% of adolescents using AI chatbots use them for companionship. Aura gathered data from the daily device use of 3,000 teens as well as surveys of families.

That includes some disturbing conversations involving violence and sex, says psychologist Scott Kollins, chief medical officer at Aura, who leads the company's research on teen interactions with generative AI.

""It is role play that is [an] interaction about harming somebody else, physically hurting them, torturing them,"" he says.

He says it's normal for kids to be curious about sex, but learning about sexual interactions from a chatbot instead of a trusted adult is problematic.

And chatbots are designed to agree with users, says pediatrician Nagata. So if your child starts a query about sex or violence, ""the default of the AI is to engage with it and to reinforce it.""

He says spending a lot of time with chatbots — having extended conversations — also prevents teenagers from learning important social skills, like empathy, reading body language and negotiating differences.

""When you're only or exclusively interacting with computers who are agreeing with you, then you don't get to develop those skills,"" he says.

And there are mental health risks. According to a recent study by researchers at the nonprofit research organization RAND, Harvard and Brown universities, 1 in 8 adolescents and young adults use chatbots for mental health advice.

But there have been numerous reports of individuals experiencing delusions, or what's being referred to as AI psychosis, after prolonged interactions with chatbots. This, as well as the concern over risks of suicide, has led psychologists to warn that AI chatbots pose serious risks to the mental health and safety of teens as well as vulnerable adults.

""We see that when people interact with [chatbots] over long periods of time, that things start to degrade, that the chatbots do things that they're not intended to do,"" says psychologist Ursula Whiteside, CEO of a mental health nonprofit called Now Matters Now. For example, she says, chatbots ""give advice about lethal means, things that it's not supposed to do but does happen over time with repeated queries.""

2. Stay engaged with kids' online lives

Keep an open dialogue going with your child, says Nagata.

""Parents don't need to be AI experts,"" he says. ""They just need to be curious about their children's lives and ask them about what kind of technology they're using and why.""

And have those conversations early and often, says psychologist Kollins of Aura.

""We need to have frequent and candid but nonjudgmental conversations with our kids about what this content looks like,"" says Kollins, who's also a father to two teenagers. ""And we're going to have to continue to do that.""

He often asks his teens about what platforms they are on. When he hears about new chatbots through his own research at Aura, he also asks his kids if they have heard of those or used them.

""Don't blame the child for expressing or taking advantage of something that's out there to satisfy their natural curiosity and exploration,"" he says.

And make sure to keep the conversations open-ended, says Nagata: ""I do think that that allows for your teenager or child to open up about problems that they've encountered.""

3. Develop digital literacy

It's also important to talk to kids about the benefits and pitfalls of generative AI. And if parents don't understand all the risks and benefits, parents and kids can research that together, suggests psychologist Jacqueline Nesi at Brown University, who was involved in the American Psychological Association's recent health advisory on AI and adolescent health.

""A certain amount of digital literacy and literacy does need to happen at home,"" she says.

It's important for parents and teens to understand that while chatbots can help with research, they also make errors, says Nagata. And it is important for users to be skeptical and fact-check.

""Part of this education process for children is to help them to understand that this is not the final say,"" explains Nagata. ""You yourself can process this information and try to assess, what's real or not. And if you're not sure, then try to verify with other people or other sources.""

4. Parental controls only work if kids set up their own accounts

If a child is using AI chatbots, it may be better for them to set up their own account on the platforms, says Nesi, instead of using chatbots anonymously.

""Many of the more popular platforms now have parental controls in place,"" she says. ""But in order for those parental controls to be in effect, a child does need to have their own account.""

But be aware, there are dozens of different AI chatbots that kids could be using. ""We identified 88 different AI platforms that kids were interacting with,"" says Kollins.

This underscores the importance of having an open dialogue with your child to stay aware of what they're using.

5. Set time limits

Nagata also advises setting boundaries around when kids use digital technology, especially at nighttime.

""One potential aspect of generative AI that can also lead to mental health and physical health impacts are [when] kids are chatting all night long and it's really disrupting their sleep,"" says Nagata. ""Because they're very personalized conversations, they're very engaging. Kids are more likely to continue to engage and have more and more use.""

And if a child is veering toward overuse and misuse of generative AI, Nagata recommends that parents set time limits or limit certain kinds of content on chatbots.

6. Seek help for more vulnerable teens

Kids who are already struggling with their mental health or social skills are more likely to be vulnerable to the risks of chatbots, says Nesi.

""So if they're already lonely, if they're already isolated, then I think there's a bigger risk that maybe a chatbot could then exacerbate those issues,"" she says.

And it's also important to keep an eye on potential warning signs of poor mental health, she notes.

Those warning signs involve sudden and persistent changes in mood, isolation or changes in how engaged they are at school.

""Parents should be as much as possible trying to pay attention to the whole picture of the child,"" says Nesi. ""How are they doing in school? How are they doing with friends? How are they doing at home if they are starting to withdraw?""

If a teen is withdrawing from friends and family and restricting their social interactions to just the chatbot, that too is a warning sign, she says. ""Are they going to the chatbot instead of a friend or instead of a therapist or instead of responsible adults about serious issues?

Also look for signs of dependence or addiction to a chatbot, she adds. ""Are they having difficulty controlling how much they are using a chatbot? Like, is it starting to feel like it's controlling them? They kind of can't stop,"" she says.

And if they see those signs, parents should reach out to a professional for help, says Nesi.

""Speaking to a child's pediatrician is always a good first step,"" she says. ""But in most cases, getting a mental health professional involved is probably going to make sense.""

7. The government has a role to play

But, she acknowledges that the job of keeping children and teens safe from this technology shouldn't just fall upon parents.

""There's a responsibility, you know, from lawmakers, from the companies themselves to make these products safe for teens.""

Lawmakers in Congress recently introduced bipartisan legislation to ban tech companies from offering companion apps for minors and to hold companies accountable for making available to minors companion apps that produce or solicit sexual content.

Most bills in the California Legislature are barely talked about in public before lawmakers take action, often after secret negotiations with lobbyists.

But a handful of controversial proposals broke through the usual rushed process, drawing hours of testimony and intense public lobbying from some of the state’s most powerful organizations that spend millions of dollars to get their way, according to an analysis of CalMatters’ Digital Democracy database, which tracks every word spoken in the Legislature.

That’s compared to the overall 2025 average, which showed lawmakers and advocates spent just 32 minutes publicly talking about each of the 1,657 bills that were discussed in at least one hearing.

These were the 10 most debated bills of the 2025 regular legislative session, according to Digital Democracy.

(Note: Advocacy groups listed below may have changed their positions as the bills were amended.)

Divide over antisemitism bill

Bill: Assembly Bill 715

Lead author: Democratic assemblymembers Dawn Addis of San Luis Obispo and Rick Zbur of Los Angeles.

Time discussed: 15 hours

Approximate number of speakers: 486

Why it was a talker: California’s Jewish lawmakers made countering antisemitism in schools their top priority this year, but opposing the bill was a coalition of education groups, unions, civil rights advocates and Muslim community organizations who feared censorship of pro-Palestinian voices and infringement on academic freedom. The groups turned out in droves to testify.

Number of groups in support: At least 68, including the Jewish Community Action, the Los Angeles County Business Federation and the Simon Wiesenthal Center.

Number of groups opposed: At least 92, including the California Federation of Teachers, the California Chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations and the California School Boards Association.

Status: Signed into law.

Local governments balk at transit-oriented housing

Bill: Senate Bill 79

Lead author: Democratic Sen. Scott Wiener of San Francisco

Time discussed: 6 hours, 40 minutes

Approximate number of speakers: 198

Why it was a talker: Local governments balked at a new state mandate allowing developers to build midrise apartment buildings within walking distance of many major train, light-rail, subway and high-frequency rapid bus stations — even if local zoning restrictions would otherwise ban such dense development.

Number of groups in support: At least 49, including pro home-building groups and the California Apartment Association.

Number of groups opposed: At least 76, including, at one point, the building trades unions, the California Association of Realtors and dozens of municipalities.

Status: Signed into law.

Charter schools oppose new restrictions

Bill: Assembly Bill 84

Lead authors: Democratic assemblymembers Robert Garcia of Rancho Cucamonga and Al Muratsuchi of Torrance.

Time discussed: 6 hours, 32 minutes

Approximate number of speakers: 491

Why it was a talker: This was the latest legislative effort by California’s powerful teachers unions and their allies to add restrictions and oversight to charter schools. Homeschool families and charter schools opposed the measure, introduced in response to high-profile charter school fraud scandals, saying it would strip millions of dollars in state funding from their programs. The bill added auditing requirements and new fees as well as a proposed new Office of Inspector General inside the Department of Education.

Number of groups in support: At least six, almost all influential unions.

Number of groups opposed: More than 200, many of them charter schools or home school groups.

Status: Failed in the Senate.

Uproar over teen sexual solicitation

Bill: Assembly Bill 379

Lead author: Democratic Assemblymember Stephanie Nguyen of Elk Grove

Time discussed: 5 hours, 28 minutes

Approximate number of speakers: 149

Why it was a talker: This bill, originally written by Democratic Assemblywoman Maggy Krell, a former state prosecutor, sought to increase penalties for soliciting teen sex. But the legislation sparked difficult discussions between progressive and moderate members of the Democratic caucus about how hard to crack down on those accused of soliciting sex from minors, based on whether the victims were younger or older teenagers.

Number of groups in support: At least 48, including law enforcement unions and some Native American tribes.

Number of groups opposed: At least 25, including ACLU and various advocates for progressive criminal justice reforms.

Status: Signed into law.

Lots to say about ICE agent masks

Bill: Senate Bill 627

Lead authors: Democratic Sen. Jessie Arreguín of Berkeley and three other senators

Time discussed: 5 hours

Approximate number of speakers: 100

Why it was a talker: Members of California’s Democratic legislative supermajority aren’t shy about speaking their minds on President Donald Trump and his controversial immigration policies, so it’s no surprise that there was a lot of discussion over California’s first-in-the nation measure to prohibit federal immigration officers and local police from wearing masks in California.

Number of groups in support: At least 45, including non-police unions, public defenders, the ACLU and immigrant rights groups.

Number of groups opposed: At least 16, almost all of them police unions.

Status: Signed into law

Democrats pitch gerrymander to counter Texas

Bill: Assembly Bill 604

Lead author: Democratic Assemblymember Cecilia Aguiar-Curry of Davis and Sen. Lena Gonzalez of Long Beach

Time discussed: 4 hours, 58 minutes

Approximate number of speakers: 76

Why it was a talker: There were plenty of heated discussions after California Democrats put forward their own gerrymandering plan after Trump pressured Texas to change its congressional maps to make new Republican districts.

Number of groups in support: At least 54, including labor unions and progressive groups.

Number of groups opposed: At least 19, including California Common Cause, Govern for California and conservative groups.

Status: Signed into law, approved by voters

Energy bill gets lengthy debate

Bill: Senate Bill 254

Lead authors: Democratic Sen. Josh Becker of Menlo Park and two other lawmakers

Time discussed: 4 hours, 55 minutes

Approximate number of speakers: 119

Why it was a talker: This energy bill created a new public financing system for electric transmission projects and extended a controversial program that shields utilities from some wildfire liability costs, but critics warned it could ultimately drive consumer bills higher. It was part of a package of energy and climate measures the Legislature passed this year.

Number of groups in support: At least 55, including trades unions, the California Democratic Party, the California Chamber of Commerce, environmental groups and the California Municipal Utilities Association.

Number of groups opposed: At least seven, including the California Farm Bureau Federation, Rural County Representatives of California and the California State Association of Counties.

Status: Signed into law.

Fees for veterans’ benefits draws testimony

Bill: Senate Bill 694

Lead author: Democratic Sens. Bob Archuleta of Norwalk and Sabrina Cervantes of Riverside

Time discussed: 4 hours, 39 minutes

Approximate number of speakers: 99

Why it was a talker: For years, veterans advocates have wanted a state law preventing companies from charging exorbitant fees to help veterans file federal disability benefits claims, something they can do for free through the government and certain veterans’ organizations. But the Legislature has repeatedly balked, as companies claim they provide an important service to help veterans get the benefits they need.

Number of groups in support: At least 25, including the California State Association of Counties and the American Legion.

Number of groups opposed: At least nine, including Veterans Guardian, one of the companies that files claims.

Status: The bill did not pass the Senate, although lawmakers announced they had a deal on the legislation and would vote on it in January.

Should AT&T opt out of landlines?

Bill: Assembly Bill 470

Lead author: Democratic Assemblymember Tina McKinnor of Inglewood

Time discussed: 4 hours, 13 minutes

Approximate number of speakers: 209

Why it was a talker: AT&T has spent millions in lobbying as it tried unsuccessfully to bow out of its legal requirement to provide copper landlines in much of the state. Rural communities and others pushed back, leading to some of the lengthiest discussions in the Legislature this year.

Number of groups in support: At least 145, including AT&T, some tribes and other groups aligned with the telecommunications company.

Number of groups opposed: At least 96, including rural counties, some unions and AARP.

Status: Failed in the Senate

Banning junk food at schools causes a stir

Bill: Assembly Bill 1264

Lead author: Democratic Assemblymember Jesse Gabriel of Encino

Imagine topping off your gas tank while flying down a stretch of highway equipped with futuristic gas pumps. Well, dream on, Klingon. Gassing up at 70 mph is not going to happen any time soon. In the meantime, though, the dream of wireless EV charging-on-the-go is getting closer to reality. Somewhat ironically, two deep red states — Florida and Indiana — are among the those leading the charge.

Florida To Michigan: Hold My Beer

The idea of an “electric highway” did seem rather futuristic when it surfaced on the CleanTechnica radar back in 2013, but by 2021 Michigan was ready to announce plans for the first wireless charging infrastructure on a public road in the US. Installation was completed in November of 2023, with the in-road infrastructure provided by the Israeli startup Electreon and the EVs provided by Ford’s E-Transit electric delivery van branch.

In November of 2024, Michigan also engaged Electreon in a new partnership with the EV startup Xos, aimed at bringing in-road wireless charging to more commercial delivery vehicles. By October of this year, plans were also in the works to install charging infrastructure in additional roadways.

In the meantime, Florida has been hatching plans of its own. The Florida project recently made the news after local station WFTV provided its viewers with an exclusive sneak peek at the work in progress, but the wheels were set in motion more than three years ago when the Central Florida Expressway Authority (CFX) teased word of an in-motion EV charging pilot project to be showcased in the new State Road 516 in Lake and Orange County.

State Road 516 is not just any old new road. Inspired by a living mobility test bed called “The Ray” in Georgia, the new 4.4-mile highway is designed as a showcase for new mobility technologies along with solar power and a more sustainable approach to highway landscaping. CFX launched plans for the new road in 2022 and CleanTechnica’s Carolyn Fortuna picked up the thread in June of 2024, taking note of a wildlife underpass, recreational trail, and native plantings along with technical details on the in-road charging system.

How Does It Work?

Futuristic as it seems, the technology pieces for in-road EV charging have been in place for some time. As CFX points out, if you have a wirelessly rechargeable electric toothbrush or smart phone, or for that matter, an induction stovetop, you have living proof that wireless inductive power transfer is a real thing. The same principle has already scaled up into stationary wireless charging for EVs, and the next step is to make it work on the fly.

For the State Road 516 project, the agency selected the US wireless charging firm ENRX (formerly IPT Technology). “Energy flows from the pre-assembled ground winding coils to a receiver pad under the vehicle through electromagnetic induction,” CFX explains.

“The technology can detect an electric vehicle is directly above it, making the lane safe for all other drivers to use, as well as the surrounding environment,” they add.

“The ENRX Charge 200 kW Electrified Roadway Technology will be able to power all vehicle classes using the roadway: passenger cars, medium-duty delivery vans, and heavy-duty trucks and buses,” CFX elaborated.

If all goes according to plan, ENRX will install its technology on approximately one mile of the new road, from Route 27 to Cork Road, but don’t get too excited just yet. It will only be available to drivers participating in the pilot project with specially equipped EVs.

Wireless EV Charging In Indiana

Each in its own way, Michigan and Florida are both ripe environments for in-road EV charging. Michigan is practically a no-brainer considering its pivotal role in automotive innovation, and Florida happens to be one of the nation’s top three leaders in EV sales, jockeying with Texas for the #2 slot behind California.

Into the mix jumps Indiana, which barely registered a blip in EV sales as of 2024, according to a state-by-state breakdown posted by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in December of 2025. Still, it’s not for lack of trying.

“Despite its former reputation as one of the nation’s top 10 coal producing states and its ongoing status as host of the iconic gas-guzzling Indy 500 auto racing event, Indiana emerged as an early promoter of vehicle electrification back in 2010,” CleanTechnica observed in 2023, taking note of an in-road charging project deploying technology developed by a team of engineers at Purdue University.

Purdue celebrated a test of the new system on December 3 of this year, calling it the first ever in-road wireless EV charging to be demonstrated on a heavy duty truck at highway speeds. The electrified road, constructed by the Indiana Department of Transportation, is located on a 1/4-mile segment of US Highway 52/231 in West Lafayette. For the record, the electric semi was provided by Cummins.

Purdue notes that dynamically charging an electric truck at highway speeds is a next-level challenge compared to charging delivery trucks on local roads. “A few other states and countries have also begun testing roads designed to enable dynamic wireless power transfer. But making this possible for highways — and particularly for semis and other heavy-duty vehicles — is a unique challenge,” the school explains. “Because vehicles travel so much faster on highways than city roads, they need to be charged at higher power levels.”

“The Purdue-designed wireless charging system works at power levels much higher than what has been demonstrated in the U.S. so far,” the school elaborated, citing the delivery of 190 kilowatts to a heavy duty electric truck going 65 miles per hour. Purdue also emphasized that the same infrastructure will also support dynamic charging for smaller vehicles with lower power needs.

EV Charging & The War On EVs

Part of the enthusiasm over dynamic charging is the convenience factor. Another significant factor is the potential for reducing the size, weight, and cost of batteries needed for a typical EV. That’s particularly important for commercial EVs, which can save precious cargo space by reducing the area set aside for battery packs.

The forward momentum on dynamic charging is yet another demonstration of the staying power of the vehicle electrification movement in the US. Despite the recent, sharp downslide in EV sales following the premature expiration of the $7,500 federal EV tax credit on September 30, activity among conventional charging station stakeholders is continuing at breakneck pace as convenience stores, quick-serve restaurants and other travel-friendly retailers compete for traffic.

In addition, domestic startups including Slate, Telo Trucks, and Faraday Future are moving ahead with plans to introduce new EVs to the US market in 2026 or shortly after. The Scout Motors branch of Volkswagen is also following through on its EV plans, though so far most of its reservations are for hybrid vehicles with on-board gasoline generators to supplement the battery.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/electric-highway-ev-charging-purdue.png,N,,2025-12-29 15:59:23.394057

From the impact of federal legislation and regulations to useful resources and beyond, explore the topics that mattered the most to you over the last year.

1. Local Impacts from Congress’ One, Big, Beautiful Bill

On July 3, the House passed the Senate’s version of the One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act (H.R. 1) in a vote of 218-214, and President Trump signed the bill into law on July 4.

Our most popular CitiesSpeak blog post of 2025 explored the key provisions from the final bill and its impact to local governments, including support, areas of concern and topics for awareness.

2. Act Now if You’re Behind on ARPA SLFRF: Non-Compliance Explained

The State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds (SLFRF) program under the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) was a historic, first-of-its-kind direct investment in cities, towns and villages of all sizes. The SLFRF program was specifically established to help communities manage and recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. For many local governments, this was the first time they had received a direct federal grant, and understandably, the reporting requirements and compliance obligations have come with a learning curve.

With the reporting portal officially closing at the end of March, our blog post answered common questions from cities on how to stay compliant with SLFRF.

3. Data Centers and Local Environmental Considerations

Data centers are physical sites that host the hardware, such as computer servers and telecommunications equipment, required for on-site or cloud data storage, as well as artificial intelligence (AI) computing.

Our blog post, which explores how the use of AI and data centers impacts local communities, covers key takeaways from a joint session of NLC’s Energy Environment and Natural Resources (EENR) and Information Technology and Communications (ITC) Federal Advocacy committees at the 2025 Congressional City Conference. During the session, elected officials shared several issues they consider when faced with data center development.

4. FEMA Act of 2025: What Local Leaders Need to Know

The Fixing Emergency Management for Americans (FEMA) Act of 2025 (H.R. 4669) represents one of the most significant updates to federal disaster management law in decades. It reorganizes the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), modernizes disaster assistance programs and changes how aid is delivered to communities.

For cities, towns and villages, the Act introduces reforms that affect how quickly funding arrives, how rules are applied and how residents access support. Our blog post covered the FEMA essentials that local leaders need to know.

5. Make the Pledge to House Homeless Veterans

No veteran should be homeless in the country they swore an oath to defend. A guest post by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) detailed the Mayor’s Pledge, a national initiative encouraging mayors to engage landlords within their communities to offer their available rental units to veterans participating in the VA’s homeless programs.

6. Real Stories, Real Needs: What Comes Next for Shutdown-Affected Communities

In the midst of the longest federal government shutdown in U.S. history, our blog post highlighted the response of several communities, including how they’ve kept essential services running and communicated openly with their residents.

7. Where Does the Opioid Crisis Stand Today in Local Communities?

Sixty-one percent of municipal leaders indicate the opioid crisis is one of the top issues — or the top issue — impacting their community. Our blog post highlighted the need for attention to the opioid crisis, particularly as many cities, towns and villages report having inadequate resources to respond.

8. Drones Above Your City — How Cities Engage with Federal Officials on Drones

Spotting a drone in the sky is becoming more normal in the U.S. Our blog post explored how local leaders can report unsafe drone flights, as well as understand the improvements needed in federal drone policy.

9. A Comprehensive Guide for Local Leaders on Managing PFAS Waste

Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are of concern because they are found in common household items such as non-stick cookware, certain garments and fabrics and personal care products. When exposed to these chemicals, studies indicate that they can harm human health in a myriad of ways, including delaying development for children, inhibiting fertility in women and a deterioration of immune functions.

Our blog post directed local leaders on steps to take for PFAS, from understanding the extent of exposure in their community to managing mitigation efforts.

10. Update on Elective Pay Tax Credits: What Cities Need to Know

The Elective Pay (also called Direct Pay) program — established under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) — is designed to provide clean energy tax credits directly to eligible entities, including local governments. This program is a game-changer for cities, towns and villages looking to advance clean energy projects without relying on traditional tax equity financing. Recent updates offer key insights for local governments seeking to capitalize on these incentives.",https://www.nlc.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2219881058-1280x853-1-edited.jpg,N,,2025-12-29 17:58:37.387674

Bechman,,,,,https://www.farmprogress.com/technology/don-t-let-technology-get-in-the-way-of-farming,"Jesse Williams uses precision technology from planting through harvest on his 1,000-acre farm in Polk County, Neb.
Precision technology tools and techniques help do it more effectively, Williams said.
“A professor of mine, Randy Shoemaker, said: ‘Don’t let the technology get in the way of science,’” Charlson said.
“I tweaked the saying: ‘Don’t let technology get in the way of farming.’ Precision technology helps us be more efficient.
“We have more control over management, like seeding rates, applying fertilizer correctly and utilizing variable-rate technology.","Jesse Williams uses precision technology from planting through harvest on his 1,000-acre farm in Polk County, Neb. From grid soil sampling to variable-rate nitrogen application, he uses state-of-the-art technology to provide the information he needs to make decisions. Then he relies on technology to help execute practices like variable-rate applications in the field.

Yet in everything Williams does, the goal is obvious. He is after maximum profitability. Precision technology tools and techniques help do it more effectively, Williams said.

Dirk Charlson, Extension educator specializing in digital agriculture at the University of Nebraska, views precision agriculture as tools to help people farm better, and not as the be-all and end-all, by itself.

“A professor of mine, Randy Shoemaker, said: ‘Don’t let the technology get in the way of science,’” Charlson said. “His point was remembering what was most important — the science of what you were studying, not the technology.

“I tweaked the saying: ‘Don’t let technology get in the way of farming.’ Precision technology helps us be more efficient. But we aren’t buying it just to have technology. We invest in it to solve problems and manage our farms better.”

Managing variability

The goal of farming is profitability, even if it is also a way of life, Charlson said. Variability is a major obstacle.

“Variability consists of inconsistent yields over years and space, and variability leads to uncertainty, including whether farming will be profitable,” Charlson said. “That is why risk management is important.”

Precision agriculture offers options that can reduce risk, he noted. Ag economists developed a systems framework to illustrate how precision tools can help, called GEMS. These factors interact together:

“Genetics is hybrid or variety choice, but it is more than that too,” Charlson said. “It is also about biology and change that comes with cover crops. We have least control over environment, which starts with weather patterns and includes interactions related to soil type, pests and nonbiological stresses.

“We have more control over management, like seeding rates, applying fertilizer correctly and utilizing variable-rate technology. Socioeconomic centers on risk management. How much risk are you willing to take? How does equipment cost factor in?”

Simple example

The goal is to use precision ag tools to manage GEMS interactions and achieve profitability, Charlson said. Identify sources of variation and yield-limiting factors, either natural or man-made. Start with analyzing yield maps. Then apply the GEMS concept to determine variation you can reduce.

Suppose there are two soil types in a field: a loam and a sandy soil. The sandy soil is drought-prone. Use GEMS to reach possible solutions:

Genetics. Select corn hybrids with drought-tolerance on the sandy soil.

Environment. If it’s available, increase irrigation on the sandy soil.

Management. Lower seeding rates on the sandy soil, increase them on the loam, and consider placing hybrids by soil type with a multi-hybrid planter.

Socioeconomics. Factor in cost of a variable-rate and/or multi-hybrid planter, and cost of variable-rate irrigation. These adjustments with precision tools are possible today — but will they pay?

“You don’t have to make all changes in one year,” Charlson concluded. “It could be a multiyear plan implemented over time.”",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltdd43779342bd9107/bltc7e8d3cbf3449101/6942d07492e6d6e5897c0827/1229M1-5750-1800x1012.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-12-29 15:13:31.483047

At this time in 2024, Michigan was expecting a windfall of federal funds to fuel a transition to clean energy, along with billions of dollars’ worth of green manufacturing projects subsidized by the Biden administration’s signature climate spending bills.

But since President Donald Trump began his second term in January and began scrapping federal climate programs he refers to collectively as “the green new scam,” Michigan has seen a wave of project and grant cancellations, along with renewed investment in fossil fuel-based manufacturing and power generation.

Roughly $540 million in climate-related grants to Michigan have been canceled or held up since Inauguration Day, according to a national database compiled by Atlas Public Policy, while shifting market forces and the end of federal tax credits for electric vehicles have caused clean manufacturing investments in Michigan to whipsaw from billions annually in recent years to $3 billion in canceled investments this year.

“It certainly mirrors what we’re seeing nationally,” said Annabelle Rosser, a research analyst with the national firm.

Instead, Michigan automakers are scaling back and refocusing on gas and hybrid vehicle production — a trend emblemized by Ford’s and General Motors’ recent decisions to scrap EV production plans at Michigan plants and retool to produce gas-powered vehicles.

“That’s just the way the market is shaking out right now,” said Glenn Stevens, executive director of MichAuto, an affiliate of the Detroit Regional Chamber.

It’s a trend likely to continue into 2026, as Trump administration officials continue their efforts to downplay climate change, deemphasize renewable energy and embrace fossil fuels.

Here’s where things stand in Michigan as the year draws to a close:

$540 million in canceled funding

Michigan has seen $540 million in canceled funding, with the biggest chunk coming from the Solar for All Program, a $7 billion US Environmental Protection Agency fund meant to expand solar energy in disadvantaged communities.

Michigan had been slated to receive a $156 million grant through that fund, while Native American tribes in the state were expecting part of a $62 million grant shared with other Great Lakes tribes.

Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel has sued over the grant cancellations, joining 22 other states to argue the administration “unilaterally and illegally terminated” the program, overstepping checks and balances to cancel congressionally approved funding.

Beyond the solar program, the federal government has canceled or proposed to cancel more than 20 Michigan grants ranging from $31.7 million to help LuxWall Inc. build an energy-efficient window glass factory in Detroit to $14,000 for a west Michigan climate resilience project.

Other canceled grants include:

1. $28.2 million for TS Conductor to build a high-capacity power line plant in Erie

2. $20.4 million for Ecoworks, a Detroit nonprofit that planned to convert houses of worship into climate resilience hubs

3. $20 million for the Inter-Tribal Council of Michigan toimprove energy efficiency in tribal homes

4. $20 million for the Southwestern Michigan Planning Commission to build two resilience hubs in Benton Harbor, upgrade energy efficiency in low-income housing and support a workforce development initiative

Smaller grants would have funded energy efficient housing in Kalamazoo, a climate change and resilience plan for the city of Flint and wild rice bed restoration in Michigan waterways.

The Trump administration has also frozen a $20 billion federal “green bank” network that had been expected to send hundreds of millions of dollars to Michigan to build and rehab housing across the state, insulate old homes and boost energy efficiency in factories.

Trump officials have signaled that more cancellations could be coming as they review tens of billions of dollars in clean energy funds awarded by the previous administration.

Michigan utilities, for example, are awaiting word on the status of $15 billion in clean energy-related loans announced days before Trump took office. And the Trump administration is reevaluating a grant program that awarded $500 million to retool a Lansing GM factory for electrified vehicles.

An exception to the administration’s shift of resources away from Biden-era energy policies: It has continued making disbursements from a $1.5 billion loan authorized in 2024 to support the reopening of the Palisades nuclear power plant and in December announced another $400 million to develop two new reactors at the site.

“President Trump has made clear that America is going to build more energy, not less, and nuclear is central to that mission,” US Secretary of Energy Chris Wright said in a statement accompanying the grant announcement.

$3 billion in canceled projects

Spurred along by federal and state subsidies and regulations that encouraged automakers to build EVs and consumers to buy them, Michigan manufacturers announced a collective $23.8 billion in new investments tied to the energy transition between 2022 and 2024, mostly related to battery or EV plants.

Fast-forward to 2025, and the trendline has reversed. Michigan saw $3 billion worth of disinvestment this year as companies scrapped planned EV factories or closed existing ones, according to the Atlas analysis.

Spokespeople for the US Department of Energy, which has overseen efforts to reprioritize fossil fuels by shifting federal resources and loosening vehicle emissions regulations, did not respond to requests for comment from Bridge Michigan.

But Trump has routinely cast EVs as a costly “scam” while downplaying the effects of climate change caused by burning fossil fuels like gasoline. During a December announcement that his administration would loosen fuel economy standards applying to new vehicles, Trump cast his pro-gas policies as a win for consumers that would “protect American jobs” and shave “at least $1,000 off the price of a new car.”

The biggest EV-related cancellation is the Gotion project, a once-planned $2.4 billion electric vehicle battery plant near Big Rapids that spent years embroiled in controversy before state officials declared the project dead this fall.

In that case, Rosser, the Atlas analyst, said, shifting federal policies weren’t the only factor.

“The rollback of the (Inflation Reduction Act) clean energy tax credits, softening demand for electric vehicles, and concerns about the company’s foreign ownership are all likely factors,” Rosser said.

This fall, battery maker XALT Energy announced plans to close its Midland headquarters and an Auburn Hills facility just two years after announcing plans to spend a “double digit million sum” expanding the facility.

Automotive supplier Dana Inc., which had vowed to invest $54.2 million at an Auburn Hills EV battery plant by the end of 2024, instead announced this fall that it would close the plant amid an “unexpected and immediate reduction in customer orders driven by lower demand for electric vehicles.”

Fortescue canceled an under-construction $210 million EV charger, battery and hydrogen generator plant at the former Fisher Body site in Detroit, citing shifting US markets and policies including the loss of “critical tax credits.”

Other losses included the closure of an Akasol electric vehicle battery factory in Warren and canceled plans to build a TS Conductor high-voltage direct current conductor plant in Erie using a since-canceled $28 million federal grant.

TS Conductor is still building the plant, but switched locations to South Carolina after receiving what company CEO Jason Huang described as a “very generous incentive package.”

Timelines and ambitions for numerous other EV and battery factory projects in Michigan have shifted amid the changing policies and market forces. GM, for instance, sold its stake in a planned EV battery factory near Lansing to LG Energy Solution and the plant’s planned opening has been delayed from 2025 to 2026. And Ford has scaled back plans for an EV battery plant near Marshall, now slated to open in 2026.

At this time in 2024, Michigan was expecting a windfall of federal funds to fuel a transition to clean energy, along with billions of dollars’ worth of green manufacturing projects subsidized by the Biden administration’s signature climate spending bills.

But since President Donald Trump began his second term in January and began scrapping federal climate programs he refers to collectively as “the green new scam,” Michigan has seen a wave of project and grant cancellations, along with renewed investment in fossil fuel-based manufacturing and power generation.

Roughly $540 million in climate-related grants to Michigan have been canceled or held up since Inauguration Day, according to a national database compiled by Atlas Public Policy, while shifting market forces and the end of federal tax credits for electric vehicles have caused clean manufacturing investments in Michigan to whipsaw from billions annually in recent years to $3 billion in canceled investments this year.

“It certainly mirrors what we’re seeing nationally,” said Annabelle Rosser, a research analyst with the national firm.

Instead, Michigan automakers are scaling back and refocusing on gas and hybrid vehicle production — a trend emblemized by Ford’s and General Motors’ recent decisions to scrap EV production plans at Michigan plants and retool to produce gas-powered vehicles.

“That’s just the way the market is shaking out right now,” said Glenn Stevens, executive director of MichAuto, an affiliate of the Detroit Regional Chamber.

It’s a trend likely to continue into 2026, as Trump administration officials continue their efforts to downplay climate change, deemphasize renewable energy and embrace fossil fuels.

Here’s where things stand in Michigan as the year draws to a close:

$540 million in canceled funding

Michigan has seen $540 million in canceled funding, with the biggest chunk coming from the Solar for All Program, a $7 billion US Environmental Protection Agency fund meant to expand solar energy in disadvantaged communities.

Michigan had been slated to receive a $156 million grant through that fund, while Native American tribes in the state were expecting part of a $62 million grant shared with other Great Lakes tribes.

Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel has sued over the grant cancellations, joining 22 other states to argue the administration “unilaterally and illegally terminated” the program, overstepping checks and balances to cancel congressionally approved funding.

Beyond the solar program, the federal government has canceled or proposed to cancel more than 20 Michigan grants ranging from $31.7 million to help LuxWall Inc. build an energy-efficient window glass factory in Detroit to $14,000 for a west Michigan climate resilience project.

Other canceled grants include:

1. $28.2 million for TS Conductor to build a high-capacity power line plant in Erie

2. $20.4 million for Ecoworks, a Detroit nonprofit that planned to convert houses of worship into climate resilience hubs

3. $20 million for the Inter-Tribal Council of Michigan toimprove energy efficiency in tribal homes

4. $20 million for the Southwestern Michigan Planning Commission to build two resilience hubs in Benton Harbor, upgrade energy efficiency in low-income housing and support a workforce development initiative

Smaller grants would have funded energy efficient housing in Kalamazoo, a climate change and resilience plan for the city of Flint and wild rice bed restoration in Michigan waterways.

The Trump administration has also frozen a $20 billion federal “green bank” network that had been expected to send hundreds of millions of dollars to Michigan to build and rehab housing across the state, insulate old homes and boost energy efficiency in factories.

Trump officials have signaled that more cancellations could be coming as they review tens of billions of dollars in clean energy funds awarded by the previous administration.

Michigan utilities, for example, are awaiting word on the status of $15 billion in clean energy-related loans announced days before Trump took office. And the Trump administration is reevaluating a grant program that awarded $500 million to retool a Lansing GM factory for electrified vehicles.

An exception to the administration’s shift of resources away from Biden-era energy policies: It has continued making disbursements from a $1.5 billion loan authorized in 2024 to support the reopening of the Palisades nuclear power plant and in December announced another $400 million to develop two new reactors at the site.

“President Trump has made clear that America is going to build more energy, not less, and nuclear is central to that mission,” US Secretary of Energy Chris Wright said in a statement accompanying the grant announcement.

$3 billion in canceled projects

Spurred along by federal and state subsidies and regulations that encouraged automakers to build EVs and consumers to buy them, Michigan manufacturers announced a collective $23.8 billion in new investments tied to the energy transition between 2022 and 2024, mostly related to battery or EV plants.

Fast-forward to 2025, and the trendline has reversed. Michigan saw $3 billion worth of disinvestment this year as companies scrapped planned EV factories or closed existing ones, according to the Atlas analysis.

Spokespeople for the US Department of Energy, which has overseen efforts to reprioritize fossil fuels by shifting federal resources and loosening vehicle emissions regulations, did not respond to requests for comment from Bridge Michigan.

But Trump has routinely cast EVs as a costly “scam” while downplaying the effects of climate change caused by burning fossil fuels like gasoline. During a December announcement that his administration would loosen fuel economy standards applying to new vehicles, Trump cast his pro-gas policies as a win for consumers that would “protect American jobs” and shave “at least $1,000 off the price of a new car.”

The biggest EV-related cancellation is the Gotion project, a once-planned $2.4 billion electric vehicle battery plant near Big Rapids that spent years embroiled in controversy before state officials declared the project dead this fall.

In that case, Rosser, the Atlas analyst, said, shifting federal policies weren’t the only factor.

“The rollback of the (Inflation Reduction Act) clean energy tax credits, softening demand for electric vehicles, and concerns about the company’s foreign ownership are all likely factors,” Rosser said.

This fall, battery maker XALT Energy announced plans to close its Midland headquarters and an Auburn Hills facility just two years after announcing plans to spend a “double digit million sum” expanding the facility.

Automotive supplier Dana Inc., which had vowed to invest $54.2 million at an Auburn Hills EV battery plant by the end of 2024, instead announced this fall that it would close the plant amid an “unexpected and immediate reduction in customer orders driven by lower demand for electric vehicles.”

Fortescue canceled an under-construction $210 million EV charger, battery and hydrogen generator plant at the former Fisher Body site in Detroit, citing shifting US markets and policies including the loss of “critical tax credits.”

Other losses included the closure of an Akasol electric vehicle battery factory in Warren and canceled plans to build a TS Conductor high-voltage direct current conductor plant in Erie using a since-canceled $28 million federal grant.

TS Conductor is still building the plant, but switched locations to South Carolina after receiving what company CEO Jason Huang described as a “very generous incentive package.”

Timelines and ambitions for numerous other EV and battery factory projects in Michigan have shifted amid the changing policies and market forces. GM, for instance, sold its stake in a planned EV battery factory near Lansing to LG Energy Solution and the plant’s planned opening has been delayed from 2025 to 2026. And Ford has scaled back plans for an EV battery plant near Marshall, now slated to open in 2026.

Windrose has released an updated U.S. zero-emissions trucking map detailing current coverage in Arizona, California, Nevada, and Texas for its Class 8 R700 battery-electric semi truck.

The map, pictured below, displays ""all of the routes we cover today, including I-5, I-10, I-15 and I-35,"" states Windrose founder, chairman, and CEO Wen Han in a LinkedIn post.

""Happy holidays and buckle up for a series of collaborations that we will announce with charging partners to help reduce (or eliminate) the cost of EV truck charging to help customers get started,"" Han continued.

The bulk of Windrose's U.S. operations, for now, clearly remain in the Southwest though this is expected to change.

Windrose's big plans

Windrose confirmed nearly a year ago it received the certificate of conformity from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), meaning the R700 has met the government agency's fuel economy and emissions requirements.

Knowing that, what about a production start and delivery dates?

Speaking to Clean Trucking at ACT 2025, Mr. Han stated that production was set to get underway in Q3 of this year in California, but this has clearly been delayed, which is not surprising nor unexpected for a young company.

[Related: Windrose CEO Wen Han's bold U.S. market plan is underway]

As a global manufacturer, Windrose, founded in 2022, has a production site in Antwerp, Belgium for EU-bound semis. Final assembly for the Asian and Oceania markets takes place in those regions.

Mr. Han added that the company is ""looking to build a bigger site in France and then a bigger site in the U.S. We're down to a small number of sections or a small number of states, [including] Canada. Now it's just a matter of which one we find to be the best match.""

Major components, including the chassis, e-axles, batteries, and suspension are expected to be manufactured in China.

Windrose vs Tesla

The Windrose R700 is equipped with a 729 kWh battery, an 800V high-voltage platform capable of megawatt-level dual-inlet charging, and a loaded autonomous range of around 420 miles with a gross weight of 98,000 lbs. A base price of around $250,000 is expected.

To compare, the Tesla Semi, due to begin series production in 2026, boasts a choice of two battery sizes (500 and 800 kWh), a 1,000V powertrain charging system, a maximum 500-mile range, and a gross weight of 82,000 lbs. Tesla has not announced final pricing.

Windrose R700 hits the road

Earlier this year Windrose joined forces with Phoenix, Ariz.-based JoyRide Logistics and EO Charging, resulting in the release of real-world performance results that are no doubt impressive.

The truck had previously demonstrated very impressive capabilities, achieving an estimated 420-mile range on a single charge and completing a 2,800-mile U.S. cross-country trip using only public charging stations.

It also successfully completed a full-route validation covering 578 miles round trip (289 miles one way), from Colton, California, to Buckeye, Arizona.

During the NACFE Run on Less event, held from September 8 to 30, 2025, live telematics data showed that the R700 spent most of its time driving (65.9%), with smaller portions inactive (25.3%), idling (7.05%), and charging (1.77%), highlighting efficient utilization.

It successfully used both a Megawatt Charging System (MCS) and Combined Charging System (CCS) chargers, reaching charging speeds of up to 738 kW at Greenlane sites. Despite its advanced electric systems, the truck maintained Class 8 performance with a curb weight under 26,000 pounds—some reports noting it below 24,000 pounds—allowing it to carry competitive payloads.

Windrose R700 reservations are open

Windrose is currently accepting U.S. reservations for its long-range R700 semi (670 km/416 miles) through its official website. A $15,000 deposit per truck is required, excluding taxes.

The reservation page further states that deliveries are due ""by 2026Q1, in [the] United States, Asia, Europe, Oceania, etc.""",https://img.cleantrucking.com/mindful/rr/workspaces/default/uploads/2025/12/windrose-r700-display.Jld1gxTzZm.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&q=70&w=1200,N,,2025-12-29 15:58:50.411707

Those power electronics can switch very quickly,” said Yilu Liu, lead researcher and UT-ORNL Governor’s Chair for Power Electronics.
The new device delivers more detailed information at faster speeds, capturing incidents that earlier technology would have missed.
Designed for flexibility, it can be embedded in power electronics, installed on a distribution line or even plugged into a wall outlet.
Utilities in places like Hawaii and Texas are using the device to understand how concentrations of power electronics interact with the grid.","Researchers at the Department of Energy’s Oak Ridge National Laboratory partnered with the University of Tennessee to develop a secure, affordable sensing device that delivers unprecedented real-time insight into electric grid behavior. The innovation, called a Universal GridEdge Analyzer, recently won an R&D 100 Award as one of the world’s top inventions.

The compact analyzer records the smallest changes in electrical voltage and current as waveforms, then almost instantly compresses, encrypts and streams the data to centralized servers. Processing 60,000 measurements per second – 500 times more than the previous technology – it can capture split-second reactions from power electronics that help run today’s grid.

“Unlike traditional centralized power plants, data centers and distributed energy plants with batteries use power electronics to connect to the grids. Those power electronics can switch very quickly,” said Yilu Liu, lead researcher and UT-ORNL Governor’s Chair for Power Electronics. “Their fast-acting nature can impact the stability of the entire grid, so monitoring these dynamics helps us improve future grid operations, keeping the lights on for everyone.”

The technology builds on UT’s long-running grid frequency monitoring network called FNET/GridEye. That network’s 200 sensors across the U.S. and about 100 more worldwide collect and transmit aggregated data for a broad overview of grid activity. The new device delivers more detailed information at faster speeds, capturing incidents that earlier technology would have missed. Designed for flexibility, it can be embedded in power electronics, installed on a distribution line or even plugged into a wall outlet.

Utilities in places like Hawaii and Texas are using the device to understand how concentrations of power electronics interact with the grid. For example, at AI data centers, even minor voltage fluctuations can trigger a switch to backup power, requiring immediate action to control the energy load.

“As EVs become more a part of our daily lives, we must ensure there are enough experienced, trained professionals out there to handle the service and maintenance needs of these high-tech vehicles,” Nana Danso, Rivian Director of Workforce Development said in a statement.

Construction of the $5 billion plant began in September.

According to Rivian, their partnership with the Georgia Science and Engineering Fair for grade 6-12 students will start with a $25,000 investment.

Separately, Rivian is launching a technical trade program for veterans in Georgia which will operate out of Fort Benning and help veterans transition from active service to the civilian workforce.

The program will have its first group of service members enrolled in a 15-week program in 2026 and graduates will be offered positions with Rivian upon completion.

Rivian also said it was creating scholarships at UGA and Georgia Tech with seed funding starting at $150,000 for each institution. The scholarship programs will begin in 2026.

At GPTC, Rivian will partner with the college to launch a training and support program to develop a workforce of qualified entry-level technicians for the company’s service and repair facilities.

“Rivian intends to build its next manufacturing home in Stanton Springs North near Social Circle, Georgia, with plans to create 7,500 jobs by 2030 in addition to 2,000 construction jobs,” the company said.",https://media.zenfs.com/en/wsb_cox_articles_232/c2215dda2581312e10b6f204b38ae7d0,N,,2025-12-29 16:58:52.286852

If one does that, the company’s core EV business does look weak.
Now the world’s third-largest EV maker by total volume (two Chinese companies are now leading the way), Tesla’s global market share has dwindled.
I do think Tesla stock will ultimately be a barometer for how the overall U.S. stock market does next year.
In my view, this stock is still a sell (or maybe a hold for those who bought Tesla stock at a much lower price, and don’t want the tax hit right now).","Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is undoubtedly one of the most divisive stocks in the market. The company’s CEO has made sure of that, with Elon Musk’s outspoken behavior and foray in the the world of politics turning this company into a love-it or hate-it type of entity.

Certainly, Elon Musk isn’t the first CEO to wade into political waters. Plenty of other companies have leaders who look for special favors from incoming administrations, and in that regard, one could argue that Musk has worked relatively well with both sides of the aisle.

That said, with very divergent views on where the largest EV company in the U.S. (now third-largest in the world, giving up its pole position to two companies in China which are dominating this race today), let’s dive into a bull and bear case on Tesla and where this stock may be headed next year.

The Bull Case

The bull case around Tesla’s ability to grow much faster than the overall market, and many of its Magnificent 7 peers, really centers around the idea that the company’s autonomous driving, robotics and AI divisions will be able to grow much faster than the company’s core electric vehicle (EV) business.

I think there are certainly catalysts that could bring about such a future. For one, CEO Elon Musk’s new $1 trillion pay package is heavily tied to the company hitting some aggressive growth numbers on these key business segments. If the company can outperform, and deliver even more growth from these business lines which could be extremely profitable, then the market is indeed pricing this company as more of a tech/AI play than an automobile maker.

The company’s ability to vertically integrate with its already-robust AI offerings, and the potential for deliveries to climb once again in a key market like China, could propel Tesla higher in 2026 as investors look for size and growth potential in the auto sector.

Indeed, if Optimus does in fact become a meaningful business (with Musk’s Master Plan IV signaling this business could be 80% of Tesla’s current sales), that’s a big potential jump in the years to come. I suppose it all comes down to investors’ collective credence in Elon Musk’s ability to turn his vision into reality. Thus far, at least, investors have been punished by the markets for going short any of his ideas.

The Bear Case

Tesla’s bear case really comes down to focusing on Tesla as an automobile maker. If one does that, the company’s core EV business does look weak. Overall, this sector is facing a range of headwinds, from EV tax credits that have now expired, to slumping sales in key global markets such as China (with competition in that market picking up considerably).

Now the world’s third-largest EV maker by total volume (two Chinese companies are now leading the way), Tesla’s global market share has dwindled. And even within the U.S. market, only 40% of new EV sales are coming Tesla’s way. That’s a far cry from the early pandemic days, when consumers really only had one reliable option to choose from.

Given this highly competitive backdrop, Tesla’s growth forecasts have turned negative, the company’s margins continue to be under pressure and erode, and a relatively stale lineup with no meaningful refreshes in years has some Tesla buyers looking for more attractive options.

That’s to say nothing to the political controversies that have come as a result of Musk’s foray into the political sphere. No matter what an investor thinks about Tesla’s brand, this company’s overall global cachet has diminished meaningfully in recent years, and that point really isn’t up for debate.

The Verdict

Most readers are well-aware that I’m generally bullish on Tesla, with my perspective mostly siding with much of the bearish narrative around Tesla’s valuation relative to its core automotive business.

That said, I can also understand the perspective ultra-bulls on Tesla have, with respect to the ability of the company’s CEO to find ways to pivot into the most profitable areas of tech many of us thought may take more time to commercialize.

I do think Tesla stock will ultimately be a barometer for how the overall U.S. stock market does next year. And on that front, I’m expecting some bigger headwinds in the year to come than most in the financial media.

As such, I’m taking a skeptical and cautious approach to highly-valued companies like Tesla right now. In my view, this stock is still a sell (or maybe a hold for those who bought Tesla stock at a much lower price, and don’t want the tax hit right now).",https://247wallst.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/imageforentry25-w2h.jpg,N,,2025-12-29 15:58:29.737195

Those who innovate and evolve with this dynamic market can win share while those who continue to rely on legacy technologies can see diminishing demand, which includes headwinds from increasing regulation against “dirty” energy. Additionally, these companies are at the whim of economic cycles, as interest rates can impact the willingness to invest in renewable energy projects.

Market Update

Thanks to the Fed’s rate hikes in 2022 and 2023, inflation has been on a steady path downward, easing back toward that 2% sweet spot. Fortunately (miraculously to some), all this tightening didn’t send the economy tumbling into a recession, so here we are, cautiously celebrating a soft landing. The cherry on top? Recent rate cuts (half a point in September 2024, a quarter in November) have propped up markets, especially after Trump’s November win lit a fire under major indices and sent them to all-time highs. However, there’s still plenty to ponder — tariffs, corporate tax cuts, and what 2025 might hold for the economy.

Like most of the clean energy industry, the beginning of the Trump administration brought uncertainty to the storage sector. Storage had a relatively good 2024 — with installations up 33% over the previous year, to 12.3 gigawatts — but a new president who had been actively hostile to renewables and particularly solar and wind introduced a new variable.

President Trump’s trade policies were a problem from the outset. In his first week in office, research suggested that the platform he proposed as a candidate, including increasing existing Section 301 tariffs against Chinese imports to 60%, could drive up costs for battery storage systems by more than 35%.

The tariffs bit both China and other countries where U.S. battery factories sourced components, including both Japan and Korea. And as Sam Jaffe, principal at 1019 Technologies, told Latitude Media at the time, Trump’s new import taxes came into effect at a particularly unfortunate time for the domestic battery makers who have slowly been building up capacity in recent years; the administration’s decision, he said, “really disrupts the entire mechanism that’s been slowly grinding forward to create U.S.-made batteries.”

Many of those manufacturers ran up against high costs, even before the Trump changes set in. In the first months of the year, both Kore Power and Freyr Battery canceled plans for greenfield factories in the U.S., citing high costs and interest rates.

These companies, which both were to lithium-ion phosphate batteries, initially made plans in light of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, which offered storage- and clean energy manufacturing-specific credits. That legislation spurred hope in the industry, Jaffe said, that “there would be a U.S. LFP manufacturing buildout.” But under Trump 2.0, he said, “all of that is in question.”

Trade policy uncertainty also hit storage integrators like Powin, which shut down over the summer, laying off nearly 250 employees and citing “unforeseen circumstances” in the market. Powin told Latitude at the time that the company’s “challenges have been compounded by recent tariff developments that have added cost and complexity to the company’s operations and ongoing uncertainty surrounding the investment tax credit.”

But then, some unexpected good news. In July, Congress passed its long-anticipated budget bill, ending the months of uncertainty with a surprise win for storage: The GOP’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” kept the sector’s federal incentives largely intact.

While both wind and solar tax credits saw an accelerated phase-out, storage projects can continue to qualify for both the 48E investment tax credit and the 45Y production tax credit under the original IRA timeline. (That said, the bill phased out the 45X manufacturing credit that battery makers have relied upon one year sooner than the IRA had.)

This win for storage appears to be linked to load growth, and especially to the needs of data centers. Load growth projections are still accelerating; one estimate quadrupled in just two years, to 166 GW of peak load growth by 2030. Against that backdrop, an important tool for making the most of the capacity we have already, no matter the source of generation, is storage.

Data centers especially are contributing to the new demand. And that includes both novel forms of long duration storage — Google signed a deal with the carbon dioxide battery startup Energy Dome, while meanwhile 100-hour battery company Form is scaling up manufacturing to meet the needs of data centers — and the more strategic deployment of distributed storage.

Distributed storage to bolster the grid

It’s not just utility-scale batteries that are seeing momentum. Data centers are beginning, slowly, to embrace behind-the-meter batteries for onsite power. In an October note to clients, the investment firm Jefferies said that “hyperscalers present a 20 GW opportunity” for BESS through 2035. “With hyperscalers increasingly embracing some permutation of grid-connection and BTM backup generation, we see BESS as a complementary resource to enable flexible load management, accelerate speed to interconnection, and provide backup capacity in a redundant form factor,” the note read.

Around the same time, Aligned Data Centers announced a deal for a 31-megawatt, 62-megawatt-hour battery alongside a data center in the Pacific Northwest — sized to allow it to get interconnected “years earlier than would be possible with traditional utility upgrades.” The project relies on two-hour batteries developed by energy storage company Calibrant Energy, and is planned to be operational next year.

These batteries are also seeing strategic deployment on the distribution grid. In October, the utility Xcel Energy proposed a first-of-a-kind approach to distributed capacity procurement (also known as DCP), which it will deploy in Minnesota between now and 2028. The program will install up to 200 megawatts of utility-owned and operated battery storage “at strategic locations on the grid” — generally local businesses and commercial and industrial sites, who would be paid for the privilege — to host much-needed capacity. The idea is that the batteries can boost overall grid health by preventing transformer overload and otherwise avoiding the need for costly upgrades.

Meanwhile, in Texas, Base Power is demonstrating that residential batteries can also be used for grid health and that doing so can be valuable to investors. The vertically integrated company manufactures, installs, owns, and operates residential batteries in Texas, providing customers backup power while simultaneously employing them for grid services. The company, which also acts as an electricity retailer, announced a $1 billion Series C this fall.

The EVs-to-storage battery switch

Against this market backdrop, major companies are beginning to reallocate resources: away from producing batteries for electric vehicles, which saw their tax credits stripped in the OBBB, and toward making them for storage.

Data centers, of course, are a huge part of this new demand.

Even before the OBBB passed, AI infrastructure developer Crusoe was quietly building a data center in the Nevada desert to test whether second-life EV batteries could be used to power AI workloads. In June, it unveiled its off-grid modular data center, powered by a new energy storage offering from the battery recycling company Redwood Materials. The company’s new business line, dubbed Redwood Energy, launched with plans to repurpose EV battery packs in a microgrid to firm up cheap renewable energy, specifically for a cheaper solution to powering data centers.

For more on Redwood Materials’ decision to start repurposing EV batteries for grid storage, listen to CTO Colin Campbell’s interview on the Catalyst podcast:

Then, automaker GM got involved. In August, the company announced an agreement with Redwood Materials to develop grid-scale energy storage, using new and repurposed batteries that were initially intended for EVs. Key to its rationale was the fact that the company — weathering the post-OBBB slow-down — found itself with far more battery cell production capacity than demand for electric vehicles.

This shift also revealed the tough conditions for the battery recycling sector. For years, it has struggled to truly scale, in part because there haven’t been enough used batteries in circulation. And the EV sector’s downswing has complicated things further. Demand for critical minerals has surged in 2025 as the U.S. race with China has intensified, but extracting valuable materials from batteries and other used equipment is incredibly challenging: logistically, chemically, and economically. Over the summer, the battery recycler Li-Cycle went bankrupt, facing a severe feedstock shortage.

Just this month, Ford followed GM’s lead — with a twist. The company said it plans to change over its EV battery capacity at a Kentucky plant to manufacture storage systems instead, which it hopes to start bringing online in 2027. It plans to invest roughly $2 billion “to capture the large demand for battery energy storage from data centers and infrastructure to support the electric grid,” the company said. In so doing, Ford joins a growing group of manufacturers, including LG Energy and SK On who have begun to do the same.",https://www.latitudemedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Latitude-1920px-32-Image-2025-12-29T120543.806.jpg,N,,2025-12-29 13:00:08.574293

Trump is attacking renewables as power demand surges For now, at least, clean energy is still booming in the U.S.
And the Interior Department limited who at the agency can issue permits for renewable energy projects on public lands.","Over the past year, the Trump administration and Congressional Republicans have waged a sweeping campaign against renewable energy, throwing a fast-growing industry into turmoil.

The administration has used federal agencies to try to slow or stop the development of wind and solar projects. And this summer, the GOP-controlled Congress voted to get rid of tax credits for renewable energy, threatening to drive up the cost of projects.

As a result of those moves, the United States is forecast to add a lot less power from renewables in the coming years than analysts previously expected, according to the International Energy Agency.

All this is occurring as electricity demand is rising faster than it has in decades. Some experts warn that limiting new power supplies could have broad economic consequences, including higher electricity costs and slower business growth. So far, it’s unclear what the Trump campaign against renewables will mean for consumers or grid reliability.

The Trump administration “may not love renewable technologies, but they’re going to need them to meet the data center demand [and] also maintain energy affordability for all consumers,” says Pavan Venkatakrishnan, policy advisor at The Foundation for American Innovation, a technology-focused research group.

A White House spokesperson, Taylor Rogers, said in a statement that renewables drive up power prices. President Trump is trying to boost resources like natural gas, coal and nuclear power, Rogers said, in order to “lower energy prices, increase grid efficiency, and win the AI race.” In a study this fall, researchers at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory said wind and solar projects, on their own, do not in general raise power prices.

With the Administration pushing to rein in renewables amid growing power demand, natural gas will likely be the big economic winner. Already the biggest source of U.S. electricity, natural gas generation is poised for dramatic growth by the end of the decade. Its continued dominance comes at a time when climate scientists have urged nations to sharply cut fossil fuel use to reduce climate pollution.

Trump is attacking renewables as power demand surges

For now, at least, clean energy is still booming in the U.S. The amount of electricity the country produces from big solar plants is projected to grow by about a third this year and by almost 20% in 2026, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said in a recent report. All told, the country is on track to add a record amount of power capacity this year from solar, wind and battery plants, according to American Clean Power, a trade group.

“It is not climate goals or imperatives primarily driving the need to build out renewables,” Venkatakrishnan says. “It is literally, ‘What are you able to get on the grid as quickly as possible?'”

The Trump administration has moved to derail the renewables industry using a multipronged attack across the federal government.

The Environmental Protection Agency has tried to terminate billions in grant funding to help low-income households and communities install solar. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management has targeted offshore wind projects with stop-work orders and legal maneuvers to strip companies of construction permits. And the Interior Department limited who at the agency can issue permits for renewable energy projects on public lands.

In a letter to Congressional leaders in December, nearly 150 solar companies said the Interior Department has created “a nearly complete moratorium” on project permitting.

“We feel it’s good policy for government agencies to be supporting power generation of every stripe that wants to come online, as long as it’s not damaging something,” says Dan Shugar, chief executive of Nextpower, one of the solar companies that signed the letter.

The attacks on renewables are happening at a time when U.S. electricity demand is surging, in large part because power-hungry data centers are being built around the country. Electricity usage is expected to increase by an average of 5.7% annually over the next five years, according to Grid Strategies, a consulting firm. Over the past two decades, demand grew by less than 1% per year.

Renewables and batteries are critical to meet rising power demand, according to industry executives and analysts, because the projects can be built quickly and produce electricity that’s relatively cheap. While wind industry growth has slowed in recent years due to problems ranging from inflation to local pushback on siting projects, solar has taken off.

“There can be talk about nuclear or other technologies. Those take years to build,” Andrés Gluski, chief executive of The AES Corporation, told Wall Street analysts in November. AES owns both clean-energy and fossil-fuel plants. “So what is going to meet the majority of the demand? Well, this year, it is probably going to be 90% as [renewable energy] and batteries. It very likely will be next year, as well.”

The Trump administration’s attacks risk further weakening a renewables industry that may already be headed for a slowdown as power companies boost spending on natural gas.

‘The golden age of power demand’

Big battery projects have been flooding U.S. energy markets in recent years, allowing companies to store electricity from renewables projects and deliver the power when it’s needed most — like after sunset.

But with data centers increasing demand for around-the-clock electricity, power companies are ramping up investment in a resource they’ve worked with for decades: natural gas.

“We may still have a year or two where [renewables and batteries] are going to be the majority of additions” to U.S. electric grids, says Sophie Karp, managing director of utilities and alternative energy at KeyBanc Capital Markets. “But that’s not because we don’t need gas in this timeframe. It’s just because it takes longer for this momentum to pick up and for major gas generation [projects] to come on the grid.”

Orders for gas turbines have been accelerating since 2023 and are on pace to triple this year compared to 2024, according to Steve Piper, director of energy research at S&P Global Energy. As companies add more gas generation, growth in the country’s renewable energy industry is expected to slow, Piper said in a recent presentation.

That doesn’t mean power companies will walk away from renewables and batteries, industry executives and analysts say.

“The golden age of power demand is creating the need for all forms of generation,” Michael Dunne, the chief financial officer at the power company NextEra Energy, said on a December call with Wall Street analysts.

It’s still unclear how much families and businesses will have to pay to meet that growing demand. The loss of federal tax incentives could increase costs for wind and solar projects, and some state renewable energy mandates have been linked to rising power prices. Meanwhile, increased exports of liquified natural gas are expected to push up domestic gas prices, the Energy Information Administration said this summer.

ICF, a consulting firm, has said it expects residential retail power prices to increase between 15% and 40% by 2030.

“The biggest thing, both at kind of the local grid level but also at the national level, is how much transmission we’re building, which is not very much,” says Alex Trembath, deputy director of The Breakthrough Institute, a technology-focused research group. Transmission lines are the backbone of the electric grid, connecting power plants to local distribution systems that deliver power to homes and businesses. “That constrains the ability to get electrons around — to get electrons from where they’re being generated to where they’re needed,” Trembath says.

How the country’s power system evolves in the coming years could also have big implications for climate change. In a recent report, the United Nations said average global temperatures are on track to rise by about 5 degrees Fahrenheit by the end of the century, compared to the pre-industrial temperatures of the mid-1800s. With that amount of warming, climate change impacts like more-extreme rainfall, hurricanes and heatwaves become much more damaging.

While natural gas creates less heat-trapping pollution than coal when it’s burned, producing and transporting gas can release huge amounts of methane, a potent climate pollutant. So, a dramatic increase in gas generation to meet rising power demand could fuel a lot more warming.

However, Trembath says the scramble for electricity may also pave the way for cleaner technologies, like nuclear and geothermal, that could help drive down emissions.

“Not over the next five years,” Trembath says, “but over the next 50 years.”",https://cdn.houstonpublicmedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/29105458/ap25168671048385-1500x1000.webp,N,,2025-12-29 15:13:21.599739

Chinese automakers exported a ton of EVs, and the biggest importer might surprise you if you haven’t been to Texas recently. And, speaking of surprises, it looks like Detroit is going to have two separate newspapers again.

Hybrids Are The New Normal

If I’ve learned anything over the last few years, it’s that moving the Overton Window has been less about slowly appealing to people in the middle and more about trying to normalize an extreme point until enough people shift halfway in that direction. This is often far from ideal, from a little-d “democracy” standpoint, but it’s just the way it works right now.

As someone who cares about the environment and drives enough electric cars to know that they’d work for a lot more people than currently own one, I’m a little troubled by the likely flattening of EV demand next year. Some of this is a price thing, as automakers prioritized the wrong vehicles. Some of this is infrastructure. Some of it, sadly, is the politicization of electric cars.

If there’s one positive outcome of this, it’s that hybrids, once looked down upon as an emasculating toy for the Larry Davids of the world, are now just normal. [Ed Note: It helps that plentiful and affordable hybrid offerings these days don’t look like jellybeans, they’re big enough for the US consumer, and they offer a really nice driving experience. -DT]. I’ve been writing about the year/decade of the hybrid for a while, and a lot of that was based on the idea that people will make logical decisions and that, for many people, a hybrid is the most logical route.

There’s a fun read in Bloomberg this week that’s basically making the point that hybrids are just another car for people, and many of them don’t even give it a second thought:

It’s also increasingly difficult to discern a hybrid from a solely gas-powered model, said Scott Hardman, assistant director of the Electric Vehicle Research Center at the University of California at Davis. Carmakers today often don’t even label a hybrid as such. Consider Toyota’s RAV4, one of the best-selling vehicles in America. The 2026 version of the SUV comes in six different variants, all of which include an electric motor and a gas tank.

“A hybrid is just a regular car now,” Hardman said. “You can buy one by accident.”

Kunes, the Midwest dealer, said most of his customers don’t pay much attention to how the vehicle propels itself; they’re just looking for the most affordable option. “People don’t necessarily come in looking for a hybrid vehicle,” he explained, “but they don’t mind taking one.”

Because vehicles like the Sienna and Camry are now hybrid-only, the technology is now reaching parity with purely gas-powered cars on average, although vehicle-to-vehicle hybrids tend to be slightly more expensive.

This is a great outcome for hybrids and for the environment. Are environmentalists celebrating this? Some are, probably, although the loudest people (primarily on BlueSky) are now suddenly anti-hybrid, because politics makes people insane.

Tesla Cuts Order From $2.9 Billion To Just $7k

If you think you’re having a bad day, imagine being the person who negotiated the deal between South Korean battery supplier L&F and Tesla for nearly $3 billion in high-nickel cathode material. That $3 billion deal is now, according to a recent filing, just $7,400.

These materials were supposed to be used for Tesla’s supposedly inexpensive 4680 cell. So what happened? This Reuters article floats a couple of theories:

Tesla CEO Elon Musk unveiled a plan in 2020 to mass-produce the 4680, a less expensive battery that he said would help it make a small, compelling $25,000 electric car that was fully autonomous within about three years from then.

However, as EV demand slowed and Tesla struggled to ramp up production and development of the 4680 cells, the company ultimately did not need as much cathode material from L&F as initially anticipated, analysts said.

The postponement (or cancellation?) of the $25,000 Tesla is a big reason, but the more immediate cause might be the market failure of the Cybertruck, which is the only vehicle using the cells. The Cybercab was also supposed to use 4680 cells, so I’m not sure what this means for Tesla’s expectations for that vehicle.

Mexico Was China’s Biggest EV Export Market In November

The renegotiation of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) is going to be the most pivotal test of Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum’s leadership, at least as it relates to the car market.

So far, Mexico has done well in dealing with a sometimes difficult-to-read White House. It’s also managed to use the tension between the United States and China to its advantage.

Currently, it makes cars and parts for the United States, while also being able to import cheap Chinese cars and EVs. According to this Bloomberg article, Mexico was actually the biggest importer of Chinese-made EVs in November.

China’s EV exports to Mexico in November rose 2,367% y/y to 19,344, the highest among all nations or territories, according to data from China Customs.

Obviously, this isn’t usual, as most Chinese EVs go to other Asian countries and Europe. I haven’t been able to find good reporting on why this happened, so I’m open to an explanation. China has huge overcapacity issues, but I think this might be a weird quirk of delivery.

Currently, the BYD Explorer No.1 RoRo ship, with a capacity of 7,000 vehicles, is in port in Mexico, and the BYD Shenzen, which can carry 9,000 vehicles, just left.

The Detroit Free Press And The Detroit News Are Two Papers Again

There aren’t many cities in America that have two flagship papers these days. I remember growing up with the Houston Post and the Houston Chronicle. Detroit is one of those cities, although a Joint Operating Agreement (JOA) for the last four decades has seen the papers operating thanks to a lot of shared resources.

That agreement is done, now, and so Detroit will have two independently operating newspapers in the new year. Did the JOA work? Here’s a Detroit News article on it, arguing that it did:

Bitterly contested in court when it was first proposed in 1986, the Detroit joint operating agreement remains a subject of debate over whether it was a success, although its primary stated goal — preserving two editorial voices — was fulfilled.

“Ultimately, what it intended to do was to keep two papers in Detroit,” said the Poynter Institute’s Kelly McBride, who advises news organizations on best practices. “So yeah, I guess that means it was successful. Clearly, I don’t think Detroit would have two papers now if the (joint operating agreement) had not existed.”

But McBride and former editors of both papers said it’s difficult to separate the role of business partnerships in the survival or death of newspapers compared to the existential loss of funding widely blamed on digital advertising.

If you live in Detroit and have been missing a Sunday edition of the Detroit Free Press, get excited.

With all the challenges facing private companies this year, they must leverage every available tax benefit.

Fortunately, lawmakers have packed the federal tax code with credits and incentives to reward taxpayers for specific activities and investments.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act made significant revisions to energy credits, imposing new restrictions and phasing out many of the credits early.

Despite the changes, there is still considerable runway for many projects, and both the tax equity financing and credit transfer markets should remain robust over the next several years.

In addition, the OBBBA enhanced existing incentives, offering new opportunities for tax-efficient structuring.

Energy Provisions

The OBBBA has reshaped the energy credit landscape. Several credits were extended or enhanced, while many others are subject to new sourcing and investment requirements or are phasing out early.

The legislation does not affect the ability to transfer or claim refundable payments for specified credits.

Consumer Credits: The OBBBA repeals several energy-related tax credits directed to consumers, each with distinct effective dates:

Section 25E—Previously Owned Clean Vehicle Credit: Repealed for vehicles acquired after Sept. 30, 2025.

Section 30D—Clean Vehicle Credit: Repealed for vehicles acquired after Sept. 30, 2025.

Section 45W—Commercial Clean Vehicle Credit: Repealed for vehicles acquired after Sept. 30, 2025.

Section 30C—Alternative Fuel Refueling Property Credit: Repealed for property placed in service after June 30, 2026.

Section 25C—Energy-Efficient Home Improvement Credit: Repealed for property placed in service after Dec. 31, 2025.

Section 25D—Residential Clean Energy Credit: Repealed for expenditures made after Dec. 31, 2025.

Section 45L—New Energy-Efficient Home Credit: Repealed for property acquired after June 30, 2026.

Depreciation: The bill eliminates the five-year depreciable life for qualified energy property, and the Section 179D deduction is repealed for construction beginning after June 30, 2026.

Investment, Production Tax Credits

The OBBBA accelerates the phaseout of the investment tax credit under Section 48E and the production tax credit under Section 45Y.

Projects that begin construction after 2033 will generally no longer qualify for these credits, with solar and wind facilities facing even earlier deadlines. To remain eligible, solar and wind projects that begin construction after July 4, 2026, must be placed in service by the end of 2027.

The legislation also introduces new restrictions related to prohibited foreign entities. Facilities beginning construction after Dec. 31, 2025, may not receive material assistance from such entities.

Material assistance is determined based on a cost ratio tied to the sourcing of eligible components. In addition, Section 48E now includes stricter domestic sourcing requirements to obtain the 10% bonus credit, reflecting a broader policy shift toward supply chain security and energy independence.

Importantly, the IRS has tightened the rules for establishing that construction has begun for purposes of the July 4, 2026, deadline for solar and wind facilities.

Under Notice 2025-43, the 5% safe harbor method is available only if taxpayers can use it to establish that construction began by Sept. 1, 2025.

Starting Sept. 2, the physical work test is the sole method for establishing the beginning of construction for wind and solar projects for purposes of the July 4, 2026, deadline.

This change applies to the credit phaseouts under the OBBBA, but not to the foreign entity of concern rules.

For FEOC exemption purposes, facilities may still use the 5% safe harbor to establish that construction began by Dec. 31, 2025.

Additionally, low-output solar facilities (≤1.5 MW AC) may continue to use the 5% safe harbor beyond that date. The four-year continuity safe harbor remains in place for projects that meet BOC requirements.

Historically, taxpayers could rely on either the physical work test or the 5% safe harbor. Notice 2025-42 now limits this to the physical work test, which requires significant physical work related to the energy property, either on-site or off-site, under a binding contract. Preliminary activities, such as design or site clearing, do not qualify.

To maintain credit eligibility, taxpayers must also meet the continuity requirement, which is satisfied if the facility is placed in service within four years of the BOC year.

Advanced Manufacturing Credit

The advanced manufacturing credit under Section 45X has been modified significantly.

While the credit is repealed for wind energy components sold after 2027, it remains available for other eligible components before a phasedown begins in 2031.

Components sold in 2031 will qualify for a 75% credit, decreasing to 50% in 2032 and 25% in 2033.

The credit is fully repealed for sales occurring in 2034 or later. Notably, the scope of the credit has been expanded to include metallurgical coal.

As with other energy provisions, the material assistance restrictions for prohibited foreign entities apply to all qualifying components.

Clean Fuel Production Credit

Under the OBBBA, the clean fuel production credit under Section 45Z has been extended through 2031.

The bill also reinstates the small agri-biodiesel credit under Section 40A, which can now be stacked with the 45Z credit.

A new geographic restriction has been added, disallowing the credit unless the feedstock is produced or grown in Canada, Mexico, or the U.S.

Additionally, the methodology for calculating greenhouse gas emissions has been revised to exclude indirect land use changes.

Prohibited foreign entity rules have also been extended to apply to clean fuel production facilities.

Planning considerations: Facilities must establish BOC by Dec. 31, 2025, to avoid FEOC restrictions beginning in 2026, and can continue to rely on the 5% safe harbor specifically to meet this deadline through the end of 2025.

Solar and wind projects beginning construction more than 12 months after the OBBBA enactment must be placed in service by the end of 2027 to qualify for Section 48E or 45Y credits.

Facilities that establish BOC by the deadline can rely on the four-year continuity safe harbor to place in service and preserve credit eligibility.

Other Energy Provisions

The clean hydrogen production credit under Section 45V is repealed for construction beginning after 2027—two years later than previously proposed.

Section 45Q credit rates for carbon capture used as a tertiary injectant or for productive use are increased to match those for permanent geologic storage, subject to new foreign-entity restrictions.

Publicly traded partnership rules now include income from carbon capture; nuclear, hydropower, and geothermal energy projects, as well as the transport or storage of sustainable aviation fuel or hydrogen.

The nuclear production credit under Section 45U is also subject to foreign entity restrictions.

Planning considerations: Taxpayers should assess project timelines and sourcing strategies in light of phaseouts and new restrictions. For Sections 45Y and 48E, construction must begin within eligibility windows—especially for solar and wind projects facing a 2027 placed-in-service deadline.

Supply chain planning is critical to avoid disqualification under foreign entity rules. Manufacturers of wind property eligible for Section 45X should consider accelerating production before the phaseout in 2027.

Clean fuel producers must ensure feedstock sourcing complies with geographic limits and updated emissions rules.

Entities pursuing carbon capture, hydrogen, or nuclear projects should factor in expanded PTP eligibility and foreign entity restrictions when structuring financing and partnerships.

Early action can help preserve credit eligibility and provide long-term benefits.

State Tax Credit Transfers

Following the enactment of the OBBBA, many states have expanded or introduced transferable tax credit programs, particularly in clean energy, affordable housing, and infrastructure.

These programs allow taxpayers to sell unused credits to third parties, creating liquidity and broader access to state-level incentives.

Transfer mechanisms vary by state, with some requiring pre-approval, certification, or registration, while others impose annual caps or limits on transfer volume.

The trend mirrors federal credit transferability under Section 6418 and reflects growing interest in flexible credit monetization strategies.

States are also beginning to adopt market infrastructure—such as broker platforms and insurance products—to support credit transfers and mitigate buyer risk.

As more jurisdictions adopt these frameworks, taxpayers with multistate operations should monitor developments closely to identify new opportunities.

Planning considerations: Taxpayers should assess eligibility and timing for generating transferable credits, especially in states with strict certification or sourcing requirements.

Early coordination with legal and tax advisors is essential to confirm compliance with documentation and reporting rules. Buyers should conduct due diligence on project qualification, transfer terms, and potential recapture risks.

Engaging with credit brokers or marketplaces may help improve pricing and identify reliable counterparties.

Additionally, taxpayers should consider how state credit transfers interact with federal incentives, particularly in structuring financing and partnership arrangements.

Strategic planning now can help enhance credit value and avoid missed opportunities as state programs continue to evolve.

New Markets Tax Credit Program Permanent

The New Markets Tax Credit program supports capital investments in low-income communities by offering tax credit-subsidized loans to eligible businesses for use toward eligible costs (e.g., real estate and furniture, fixtures, and equipment).

These loans often feature interest-only terms, below-market rates, and principal forgiveness after seven years, providing businesses with a permanent cash benefit.

Previously set to expire at the end of 2025, the NMTC program was made permanent by the OBBBA, with a continued annual allocation authority of $5 billion.

Eligible businesses—both for-profit and nonprofit—can apply for NMTC financing for capital expenditure projects in qualifying census tracts.

The program supports a wide range of sectors, including manufacturing, healthcare, education, renewable energy, and retail, though it excludes farming and residential rental activities.

Each year, certified Community Development Entities apply to the CDFI Fund for NMTC allocations.

If awarded an allocation, CDEs raise equity from tax credit investors and deploy capital to eligible businesses (otherwise known as Qualified Active Low-Income Community Businesses) based on community impact and strategic priorities, which may vary by geography or industry.

Planning considerations: The NMTC program remains highly competitive. Early engagement with CDEs and timely application are critical to securing financing.

Businesses should prepare detailed project plans that demonstrate substantial community impact and align with CDE priorities.

Acting early improves the likelihood of receiving funding and may unlock additional benefits.

Work Opportunity Tax Credit Set to Expire

The OBBBA did not extend the work opportunity tax credit, which is now set to expire for any individuals who begin work after Dec. 31, 2025.

The WOTC provides a valuable incentive for employers who often hire workers from specific targeted populations, including veterans, people with disabilities, people on food assistance, certain youth employees, and ex-felons.

Employers who frequently screen for qualified individuals as part of their hiring process should monitor the legislative process for a potential extension of the credit.

Pass-Through Deduction

The OBBBA makes permanent the 20% deduction for qualified business income under Section 199A and favorably adjusts the phaseout of the deduction for taxpayers who do not meet the wage expense and capital investment requirements or who participate in a “specified service trade or business.”

Planning considerations: The permanence of this provision provides welcome certainty for private companies engaged in qualifying activities.

The deduction is not available for a range of specified service businesses. There may be opportunities to segregate activities and to increase or allow deductions.

The safe harbor for rental activity to qualify as a Section 199A trade or business under Rev. Proc. 2019-38 remains in effect.

R&D Credit Opportunities

The research credit remains one of the most powerful incentives in the tax code, and the IRS continues to receive a high volume of claims, straining examination resources.

To improve administration and reduce improper claims, the IRS recently made several changes to Form 6765, clarifying documentation requirements for claiming the credit.

The revised Form 6765 was partially finalized for tax year 2025, with the IRS making the mandatory reporting of qualified research expenses by business component optional in Section G.

When Section G becomes mandatory for the 2026 tax year, taxpayers will be required to disclose the top 80% of QREs, with controlled group members required to attach detailed entity-level breakdowns.

Section E is currently mandatory and includes new questions related to officer wages, acquisitions, and use of the ASC 730 directive.

These updates reflect the IRS’s ongoing efforts to enhance transparency and strengthen audit readiness.

In response to ongoing compliance concerns, the IRS has increased scrutiny of research credit filings, including more frequent audits.

However, due to temporary resource constraints, some IRS Exam functions are operating at reduced capacity, which may delay enforcement actions.

Taxpayers should confirm that they are properly documenting claims and exploring state credit opportunities.

State Credit Changes

Over the past year, several states have enacted or revised legislation related to research and development tax credits. These changes reflect a growing trend to incentivize innovation and attract high-tech investment.

These states include:

Arizona: Arizona now permits the use of the alternative simplified credit (ASC) method for computing its credit for increased research activities. This provides greater flexibility and may lead to greater benefits. Refundable credits are available for small businesses with fewer than 150 employees, subject to pre-approval from the Arizona Commerce Authority.

Arkansas: Arkansas expanded its credit options, offering up to 33% for strategic research areas and university partnerships. Credits are nonrefundable but can offset 100% of state tax liability and be carried forward for up to nine years.

Connecticut: Connecticut expanded its R&D and R&E credits under H.B. 7287. Single-member LLCs may now qualify if they meet specific criteria. Refundability increased to 90% for small biotech firms and 65% for other small businesses, capped at $1.5 million per company annually.

Iowa: Iowa enacted Senate File 657, replacing its research activities credit with a targeted R&D tax credit program effective Jan. 1, 2026. Eligibility is limited to sectors such as advanced manufacturing, bioscience, finance, insurance, and technology. Credits are capped at $40 million annually and require CPA-verified QREs and a competitive application process through the Iowa Economic Development Authority.

Massachusetts: Massachusetts increased the maximum allowable credit for certain industries and introduced new documentation requirements for software development and AI-related R&D.

Michigan: Effective Jan. 1, 2025, Michigan reintroduced its R&D tax credit. Large businesses may claim 3% of qualifying expenses up to a base amount and 10% above it, capped at $2 million. Small businesses may claim 15% above the base amount, capped at $250,000. An additional 5% credit is available for university collaborations, capped at $200,000. The credit is refundable and subject to an annual cap of $100 million.

Minnesota: Minnesota introduced partial refundability for its R&D credit: 19.2% for 2025, increasing to 25% for 2026–2027.

Oklahoma: Oklahoma revised its R&D credit to align more closely with federal QRE definitions and introduced a new pre-approval application process.

Texas: Texas enhanced its franchise tax R&D credit via SB 2206 and repealed the R&D equipment sales tax exemption effective Jan. 1, 2026.

Planning considerations: Navigating the R&D credit has become more complex amid heightened review, evolving case law, and new compliance measures.

Taxpayers should make sure claims are well-supported and consistent with updated guidance to reduce audit risk and avoid delays.

Taxpayers should carefully assess eligibility for both federal and state research credits, maintain contemporaneous documentation, and prepare to defend claims under examination.

Strategic planning is essential to leveraging available incentives, especially given the complexity and variability of state-level programs.

Using a trusted tax advisor can help taxpayers maintain compliance with IRS and state regulations and effectively substantiate research credit claims.

Rules Changed for Qualified Small Business Stock

The OBBBA significantly enhances a tax-efficient structuring option for private companies. Qualified small business stock under Section 1202 offers tax-free appreciation and has been increasingly used by private equity in recent years.

Enacted in 1993, Section 1202 generally allows a non-corporate taxpayer to exclude a percentage of the gain from the sale or exchange of QSBS held for more than five years.

The eligible gain exclusion percentage is based on the date the stock is issued.

For stock issued before July 5, 2025, the maximum amount of gain on QSBS that can be excluded for any tax year by each taxpayer with respect to each issuing C corporation is generally limited to the greater of: (i) $10 million, minus the amount of gain excluded by that taxpayer in prior years with respect to the same issuing corporation; or (ii) 10 times the taxpayer’s aggregate adjusted basis in the QSBS sold during the tax year.

For stock issued after July 4, 2025, the OBBBA increases the $10 million limit to $15 million and adjusts this limit for inflation beginning in 2027. In addition, the OBBBA creates new 50% and 75% gain exclusion categories for QSBS held for at least three and four years, respectively.

The various QSBS exclusion percentages, exclusion limits, and required holding periods by stock issuance date are set out in the table below.

The OBBBA also increases the limit on aggregate gross assets to satisfy the qualified small business test for purposes of Section 1202. These thresholds are now as follows:

At all times through the date of issuance, the corporation’s aggregate gross assets must not have exceeded $50 million for issuances before July 5, 2025, or $75 million for issuances after July 4, 2025; and

Immediately after the date of issuance (and after considering amounts the corporation received in the issuance), the aggregate gross assets of the corporation must not exceed $50 million or $75 million for issuances before July 5, 2025, or after July 4, 2025, respectively. Aggregate gross assets are defined as cash plus the aggregate adjusted tax basis of the corporation’s other assets.

Planning considerations: After an issuance is deemed to be QSBS under Section 1202, the corporation’s gross assets can exceed the applicable threshold (either $50 million or $75 million) at a later date without prohibiting the previously issued stock from receiving Section 1202 treatment.

By increasing the threshold, the OBBBA renews an existing corporation’s ability to issue QSBS if their aggregate gross assets have exceeded $50 million in the past but have never exceeded $75 million.

This higher threshold also expands the potential QSBS benefits for private equity firms when acquiring target businesses with enterprise values of up to $75 million.

Opportunity Zone Extension

The OBBBA made the qualified opportunity zone program permanent, preserving one of the most generous tax incentives ever offered by Congress.

The provision can offer benefits to investors looking for tax-efficient returns, individual private companies investing in specific geographies, or asset managers setting up funds.

The OBBBA not only makes the program permanent, but it also changes the rules in essential ways. Funds and investors should consider the implications for their planning strategies.

The changes could affect the timing of gain transactions and capital contributions, the location of investments, and the compliance burdens for funds.

The current QOZ designations will expire at the end of 2026. New zones will be designated in rolling 10-year designation periods under new criteria that are expected to shrink the number of qualifying zones.

Under the current program, taxpayers can defer capital gains by investing in a qualified opportunity fund.

For investments made after 2026, taxpayers will be required to recognize the deferred gain five years after investing, but will receive a 10% increase in basis for holding the investment for five years. For QOFs operating in a new category of rural opportunity zones, this basis increase is 30%.

Taxpayers who make investments before the end of 2026 must still recognize the deferred gain at the end of 2026.

The more powerful tax benefit may be the tax-free appreciation on the underlying investment itself. Taxpayers will still receive a full basis step-up to fair market value for property held 10 years, but the OBBBA added a rule freezing the basis step-up to the FMV at 30 years after the date of the investment.

The operational rules for QOFs and qualified opportunity zone businesses are generally unchanged, except for property held in a rural opportunity zone.

The threshold for establishing the substantial improvement of qualifying property in a rural opportunity zone will be 50% of the basis rather than 100%, effective for any determinations after July 4, 2025.

QOFs and QOZBs will both be subject to increased reporting requirements.

Companies looking for new tax-efficient investing opportunities and gain deferral strategies should reassess their investment options, paying particular attention to which geographies are likely to qualify in 2027.

Planning considerations: The timing of capital gains transactions will be important. Delaying a capital gain transaction could allow taxpayers to make a deferral election in 2027 and defer recognizing the gain until well after the current 2026 recognition date.

Conversely, taxpayers planning investments in geographic areas that are unlikely to be redesignated may need to make the investments before the end of 2026.

Existing QOFs and QOZBs should consider their long-term capital needs because it is not clear whether any “grandfathering” relief will allow additional qualified investments in funds operating in QOZs that are not redesignated.

The new reporting rules will apply to both new and existing QOZs and QOZBs for tax years beginning after the date of enactment, and those entities will need to collect and report substantial new information that has never before been required.

REIT Structuring, Real Estate Benefits

The real estate investment tax structure remains an effective way to structure certain real estate activities with only one layer of tax.

The OBBBA raises from 20% to 25% the portion of the gross asset value of a REIT that may be attributable to equity and debt securities of taxable REIT subsidiaries, effective for tax years beginning after 2025. The change should provide added flexibility.

In addition, the OBBBA allows the completed contract method of accounting for many residential condominium, construction, and sale projects, effective for contracts entered into after July 4, 2025.

For residential developers that meet the average annual gross receipts test under Section 448 ($31 million in 2025), the maximum estimated contract length is increased from two to three years to qualify for the exception from the UNICAP rules under Section 263A.

Planning considerations: This provision provides much-needed tax relief to condo developers who had to report income under the percentage-of-completion method, which often required reporting income before receiving payment.

Allowing the use of the completed contract method of accounting allows better matching of reporting taxable income with the receipt of cash by the developer.

Unfortunately, the relief is provided only prospectively for contracts entered into after the July 4, 2025, enactment date.

Therefore, taxpayers with contracts entered into before the enactment date will continue to be subject to the old rules.

Moreover, reporting income for projects begun in prior years may be bound to the prior method of accounting.",https://www.cbia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Tax-Analysis_092518.png,N,,2025-12-29 11:58:57.160395

And many reserve the right to make further changes without public notice of any kind.
NEPA requires public notice at one point: when the agency has already decided to do an environmental impact statement, it must publish a notice of intent and obtain public feedback.
And these procedural changes are being made in a way that itself lacks transparency and public input.","The Trump Administration is at war with transparency and public input.

A striking pattern has emerged from the Administration’s paring back of NEPA. These efforts persistently target requirements for transparency and public input That applies to the administration’s permitting reforms. It also applies to the process that is generating those permitting reforms. In both situations, agencies are fleeing the light of day.

Until the Trump Administration, the process of environmental review involved ample opportunities for public review. To take just one example, agencies were required to make their draft impact statements public and receive public comment. Even when the agency was conducting an environmental assessment to decide whether an impact statement was needed, there was input into the process. Moreover, these requirements were contained in regulations by the Council for Environmental Quality (CEQ) that were formally published by the government. From the Carter Administration through the Biden Administration, the CEQ regulations were the product of extensive public notice and comments.

In his first term in office, Trump followed this same process. But in his second term, he overturned the executive order by Jimmy Carter directing agencies to follow the CEQ regulations and directed CEQ to rescind the regulations. CCEQ repealed the regulations immediately with a token opportunity for after-the-fact public comment. That’s basically the “sentence first, trial after” procedure embraced by the Red Queen in Alice in Wonderland. The Administration has used it in many regulatory proceedings.

Trump also ordered agencies to adopt their own NEPA procedures with CEQ guidance. The resulting procedures are quite varied. Some of them are supposed to be binding rules. Others are guidelines, or even just handbooks of agency practice. Public input was not a factor. And many reserve the right to make further changes without public notice of any kind. The upshot is that instead of having publicly available, uniform rules across the executive branch, we now have an opaque hodgepodge of agency statements.

Many of the new agency procedures rollback previous opportunities for public input in the environmental review process. NEPA requires public notice at one point: when the agency has already decided to do an environmental impact statement, it must publish a notice of intent and obtain public feedback. That notice may not tell the public much about what impacts or alternative actions or mitigation measures that agency plans to consider. More importantly, that notice will only be given in the small sliver of cases where the agency’s already decided to do an impact statement. In the vast majority of cases, there may be no public notice at all.

In short, the Administration has attacked transparency and public input at two levels. Agencies are adopting procedures that could largely eliminate meaningful public participation. And these procedural changes are being made in a way that itself lacks transparency and public input.

These changes limit the potential for public oversight of government actions that, taken alone or as a group, will have major environmental impacts – notably, oil production, coal mining, nuclear reactors, and pipelines.

The company is studying the ways that its EVs can support the electric grid better, especially during emergencies.

While Toyota does not yet offer EVs with bidirectional charging, it says the technology has immense potential to ""transform the broader energy ecosystem.""

Blame AI data centers, or an outdated power grid, or extreme temperatures, or all of the above. However, one thing is clear as we head into 2026: the United States is on track for unprecedented electricity demand.

That might sound like an argument against electric vehicles. After all, why unleash an entire fleet of cars on this country that could further drain our already shaky electric grid? But that's only because most people don't know about bidirectional charging: an EV's ability to charge other devices using its battery, or power entire homes, or even put energy back into the grid.

Stay informed with our newsletter every weekday

For more info, read our Privacy Policy & Terms of Use.

Several EVs already offer this capability, and it's increasingly becoming a standard feature for these cars. Meanwhile, many automakers are working with electric utilities on vehicle-to-grid (V2G) pilot programs that could more directly support local power networks using energy from EV batteries.

The latest one to step up is Toyota. The automaker recently announced that it's entering a new phase of a longstanding V2G pilot program at its North American headquarters in Plano, Texas. Working with Oncor, a huge energy utility in the Lone Star State, and using Fermata Energy's bidirectional EV charger, a Japanese-spec bZ4X test vehicle is currently putting energy back into the grid. The charger ""enables bidirectional energy flow by analyzing price signals and grid conditions to determine the optimal times to charge the vehicle and discharge stored energy back to the grid,"" the automaker said.

Toyota is also running similar pilot programs with other utilities across the country, including San Diego Gas & Electric and Pepco in Maryland. In doing so, the company is monitoring what those local energy markets' needs actually are, and what customers will need as well.

Generally, with V2G programs, EV drivers hook their cars up to a special charger like this one that is designed to send energy back into the grid. The local electric utility itself must also be set up to do this. When deemed necessary, energy from a car will be transmitted into the grid to support area power, and drivers often get a credit for helping out—and they can opt out or unplug at any time.

It would be a sea change for power in the U.S. if every EV were to be V2G-enabled, and if every electric grid was set up to work with them in this way. But Toyota offered a startling statistic about the potential of this technology: ""Currently, more than 4 million battery electric vehicles are on U.S. roads. If all were equipped with bidirectional charging, they could collectively contribute approximately 40,000 megawatts to the grid—a power output similar to that of 40 nuclear power reactors,"" the automaker said.

While gasoline-powered cars can only send energy in one direction—into the wheels of the car itself—an EV's ability to share power could be a huge boon to the grid as energy demand rises and costs rise along with it. According to the Wall Street Journal, the U.S. Energy Department expects the average residential electricity rate to jump 4% next year, even after a 4.9% increase in 2025.

Clearly, EVs alone can't solve that problem. And Toyota itself does not currently offer any EVs with V2G or V2L capability, unlike Hyundai, Nissan, Ford, General Motors and others. But it seems inevitable that Toyota will jump in eventually.

And as this scales, it could be more beneficial than many people realize. “By enabling bidirectional charging, we’re exploring how we can help customers potentially save money while also reducing carbon emissions from the grid,"" Christopher Yang, senior vice president of Enterprise Strategy & Solutions at Toyota Motor North America, said in a statement. And that, he said, is ""a win-win for drivers and the environment.”

Wind + solar represent almost one-fifth of total US electrical generation – a larger share than that provided by either coal or nuclear power.
Between January 1 and October 31, 2025, utility-scale solar capacity grew by 19,477.6-MW while an additional 4,837.7-MW was provided by small-scale solar.
EIA foresees continued strong solar growth, with even more utility-scale solar capacity - 36,071.9-MW - being added in the next twelve months.
Moreover, the installed capacity of utility-scale and small-scale solar combined (244,308.6-MW) would surpass that of wind (166,260.3-MW).","During the first ten months of 2025, solar and battery storage dominated growth among competing energy sources. Moreover, all net new generating capacity in 2026 is forecast to be provided by renewable energy sources and batteries.

EIA’s latest monthly “Electric Power Monthly” report (with data through October 31, 2025), once again confirms that solar is the fastest growing among the major sources of US electricity.

In October alone, electrical generation by utility-scale solar (i.e., >1-megawatt (MW)) expanded by 23.3 percent compared to October 2024 while “estimated” small-scale (e.g., rooftop) solar PV increased by 12.6 percent. Combined, they grew by 20.6 percent and provided 9.1 percent of the nation’s electrical output during the month, up from 7.8 percent a year ago.

Moreover, utility-scale solar thermal and photovoltaic expanded by 34.5 percent while that from small-scale systems rose by 11.3 percent during the first ten months of 2025 compared to the same period in 2024. The combination of utility-scale and small-scale solar increased by almost a third (28.1 percent) and produced a bit over 9.0 percent (utility-scale: 6.86 percent; small-scale: 2.16 percent) of total US electrical generation for January-October - up from 7.2 percent a year earlier.

Similarly, solar-generated electricity year-to-date (YTD) easily surpassed - by over 67 percent - the output of the nation’s hydropower plants (5.4 percent of total generation). In October alone, solar-generated electricity nearly doubled hydro’s output. In fact, in both October and YTD, solar produced significantly more electricity than hydropower, biomass, and geothermal combined.

Wind continues to hold the lead among renewables. Wind turbines across the US produced almost a tenth (9.9 percent) of US electricity in the first ten months of 2025 – an increase of 1.1 percent compared to the same period a year earlier and 84 percent more than hydropower.

Wind + solar represent almost one-fifth of total US electrical generation – a larger share than that provided by either coal or nuclear power.

During the first ten months of 2025, electrical generation by wind plus utility-scale and small-scale solar increased by 12.4 percent and provided almost a fifth (18.9 percent) of the US total, up from 17.3 percent during the first ten months of 2024.

Further, the combination of wind and solar provided 16.6 percent more electricity than did coal during the first ten months of this year, and 10.8 percent more than the nation’s nuclear power plants. In fact, while solar and wind expanded, nuclear-generated electricity experienced zero growth.

Electrical output YTD by the mix of all renewables was almost 26 percent of total US generation.

The mix of all renewables (i.e., wind and solar plus hydropower, biomass and geothermal) produced 8.6 percent more electricity in January-October than they did a year ago and provided (25.7 percent) of total US electricity production compared to 24.3 percent twelve months earlier.

Renewables’ share of electrical generation is now second to only that of natural gas whose electrical output actually dropped by 3.6 percent during the first ten months of 2025.

During the past year, solar and battery storage have dominated capacity additions, coupled with a strong showing by wind.

Between January 1 and October 31, 2025, utility-scale solar capacity grew by 19,477.6-MW while an additional 4,837.7-MW was provided by small-scale solar. EIA foresees continued strong solar growth, with even more utility-scale solar capacity - 36,071.9-MW - being added in the next twelve months.

Explosive growth was also experienced by battery storage, which grew by 45.0 percent since the beginning of the year and added 12,150.3-MW of new capacity. EIA also notes that planned battery capacity additions during the next 12 months total 21,940.4-MW - a further increase of 56 percent.

Wind also made a strong showing since January 1, adding 3,796.0-MW, while planned capacity additions over the next year total 9,567.0-MW (on-shore) plus 800.0-MW (off-shore).

On the other hand, during the past ten months, natural gas capacity increased by only 3,479.6-MW and nuclear power added a mere 46.0-MW. Meanwhile, coal capacity plummeted by 3,241.1-MW and petroleum-based capacity fell by an additional 476.3-MW.

Thus, since January 1 - roughly the beginning of the Trump Administration, renewable energy capacity, including battery storage, small-scale solar, hydropower, geothermal, and biomass ballooned by 40,174.4-MW while that of all fossil fuels and nuclear power combined actually declined by 218.0-MW.

In 2026, all net new generating capacity is projected to come from renewables and battery storage.

EIA forecasts the trends seen in 2025 YTD to continue and accelerate during the coming 12-month period.

Utility-scale renewables plus battery storage are projected to increase by 68,528.0-MW (EIA does not provide a forecast for small-scale solar, but the SUN DAY Campaign estimates it will provide an additional 7,200-MW).

Meanwhile, natural gas capacity will have a net increase of only 4,167.4-MW, which will be completely offset by a drop of 4,287.0-MW in coal capacity. Petroleum and “other gases” will decrease by 42.2-MW. In addition, EIA does not project any new growth for nuclear power in the coming year.

Thus, in 2026, all net new capacity growth will be attributable solely to renewables and battery storage.

Should that forecast materialise, by October 31, 2026, the mix of all renewables, including small-scale solar, would reach 504,634.6-MW - almost equal to that of natural gas (514,018.2-MW) - and account for over 36 percent of US generating capacity.

Moreover, the installed capacity of utility-scale and small-scale solar combined (244,308.6-MW) would surpass that of wind (166,260.3-MW). Solar capacity would also handily exceed that of coal (166,649.5-MW) and more than double that of nuclear power (98,437.2-MW) although the latter two sources would still have significantly higher capacity factors.

“As 2025 draws to a close, it is clear that - notwithstanding the roadblocks created by the Trump Administration - growth by renewable energy sources and battery storage has greatly outpaced fossil fuels and nuclear power” said the SUN DAY Campaign's executive director Ken Bossong. “Moreover, it now appears highly possible that renewables and batteries could account for 100 percent of net new capacity additions in 2026.”

The SUN DAY Campaign is a non-profit research and educational organization founded in 1992 to support a rapid transition to 100 percent reliance on sustainable energy technologies as a cost-effective alternative to nuclear power and fossil fuels and as a solution to climate change.

Circuit Court, the same court that canceled Rio Grande LNG’s FERC approval last year.
That’s still the case, according to this new lawsuit, even after FERC completed a court-ordered supplemental environmental impact statement (SEIS) of the Rio Grande LNG project this summer.
What FERC didn’t include, as noted in the lawsuit, was Rio Grande LNG growing from a 5-train to a 6-train facility, possibly even larger.
FERC says that the Rio Grande LNG project complies with the Clean Air Act.","Federal regulators overseeing the Rio Grande LNG project outside of Port Isabel and Brownsville, Texas, are still failing to consider the operation’s anticipated air pollution and the resulting impact on public health, according to a new lawsuit.

Earthjustice, the Sierra Club, the City of Port Isabel, and the South Texas Environmental Justice Network sued the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) earlier this month for approving the Rio Grande LNG project.

The Laguna Madre area is the last region of the Texas coastline without an operating LNG plant. It has thereby avoided the pollution and environmental damage seen across the wider Gulf Coast from such facilities.

All of the operating LNG plants have violated the Clean Air Act at least once, as Deceleration has reported. Some have also violated the Clean Water Act. They often release emissions imperceptible to the human eye.

This is the third time FERC has approved the project, once again after being sued for not properly measuring how the project will impact nearby lower-income communities of color. The first lawsuit was filed in 2021.

The groups filed their lawsuit in the D.C. Circuit Court, the same court that canceled Rio Grande LNG’s FERC approval last year. The court at that time said that FERC’s environmental analysis was “deficient” under the National Environmental Policy Act.

That’s still the case, according to this new lawsuit, even after FERC completed a court-ordered supplemental environmental impact statement (SEIS) of the Rio Grande LNG project this summer. FERC approved the project again in August 2025.

“FERC has given its third attempt to reapprove the project, and they still haven’t fixed the problems the court identified the first time,” Nathan Matthews, senior attorney at Earthjustice and representing the groups and city in the lawsuit, told Deceleration.

Those problems, according to the lawsuit, include FERC not thoroughly investigating how Rio Grande LNG’s pollution would impact regional air quality and not incorporating Rio Grande LNG’s supposed carbon capture system into its analysis, despite the company saying it is still pursuing one.

What’s notable this time around is FERC’s claim that it is no longer obligated to consider how Rio Grande LNG could harm the low-income communities of color near it. Nearly all LNG facilities across the U.S. Gulf Coast are in communities with high poverty rates, according to U.S. Census data.

FERC cited the Trump administration’s executive orders to “unleash” the oil and gas industry and end “illegal discrimination” as its reason for not considering how nearby “environmental justice communities,” or lower-income communities of color, would be harmed by the project.

In approving the project for a third time, FERC said the project’s economic benefits outweigh the negatives, the latter of which, according to the regulator, include people being able to see the facility and an increase in particulate matter drifting into a nearby wildlife refuge.

What FERC didn’t include, as noted in the lawsuit, was Rio Grande LNG growing from a 5-train to a 6-train facility, possibly even larger. (An LNG “train” is a liquefaction unit that produces LNG. The sixth proposed Rio Grande train, for which NextDecades anticipates requesting a permit in 2026, would increase production by 6 million tons of LNG per year—allowing for a total of 426 LNG tanker visits to the site per year.)

FERC says that the Rio Grande LNG project complies with the Clean Air Act. But that doesn’t mean that operations will stay within the limits of its state-issued air permit or federal standards.

As Deceleration wrote last month, the Environmental Integrity Project recently used regulator data to show how every operating LNG facility in the U.S. has violated its air permit at least once; one Louisiana facility did so thousands of times in a year. Optical gas imaging cameras have shown facilities emit from more than just their flare stacks.

“Even if the terminal doesn’t violate any of the Clean Air Act standards, said Earthjustice’s Mathews, “it’s still going to be a lot more pollution in the surrounding communities, and that’s going to cause harm to those communities, regardless of whether we look at who those communities are.”

Matthews said the groups have not decided whether they will pursue an order to stop construction at the site. A similar request last year was denied by the court. Though it could be months before the federal court takes up the new lawsuit, Matthews said. Last year’s court ruling came a little more than a year after the groups appealed FERC’s second approval.

NextDecade did not respond to a request for comment.

The groups’ lawsuit also names the Rio Bravo Pipeline, a portion of which runs through or near land owned by the Carrizo/Comecrudo Tribe of Texas.

“Once again, the FERC is not doing a full environmental review nor consultation with our Tribe, doing everything they can to give the LNG companies anything they want at the expense of our Tribe and our people,” Tribal Chairman Juan Mancias said in a press release.

NextDecade also has a storage site near the tribe’s land just outside of Brownsville, much of it filled with pipeline segments and construction machinery.

Similarly, Commonwealth LNG in Hackberry, Louisiana, which is owned by a Houston-based company, had their state-level authorization revoked by a local court in October for failing to consider its environmental justice impacts. But last month the state issued another permit, saying that “the benefits of this project outweigh the costs to the community.”

NextDecade says it expects to ship out its first gas cargoes from its three-train facility by 2027. The project is already affecting traffic on Highway 48. Locals complain of fast drivers and congestion.

The City of Port Isabel has vocally opposed LNG projects since the companies started scoping out the area more than a decade ago, with resolutions against their development and against granting them tax abatements.

Port Isabel’s City Manager, Jared Hockema, who has been with the city since it started opposing LNG development, says delaying the project has been worth it.

“That’s a generation of kids that grew up without air pollution because of those efforts. And that’s certainly worthwhile,” Hockema told Deceleration. “And what it reminds us of is that in life, there’s always struggle and progress is not permanent. You have to fight to keep it.”",https://d3l0i86vhnepo5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/28214757/rio-grande-lng-feature-1024x576.png,N,,2025-12-29 11:59:13.891587

The past 12 months highlight the global pullback from several decades of EV investments in the West. Political shifts aligned with uncertain market conditions, turning cautious strategic changes into a full-blown retreat.

Ford Motor Co. is walking back its EV plans and refocusing on hybrid and gasoline vehicle manufacturing. The automaker said Dec. 15 that the change in focus will result in special charges totaling about $19.5 billion, mostly in the fourth quarter.

Ford has indicated it is willing to take a short-term hit to get out of its costly longer-term EV strategy.

In September, Stellantis decided to cancel a fully electric Ram pickup and instead focus on an extended-range version.

General Motors said in May that it would shift the Tonawanda propulsion plant in Buffalo, N.Y., from EV drive unit manufacturing to engines for gasoline-powered vehicles.

Toyota is conducting a safety recall involving certain model year 2025-2026 Toyota Camry and 2026 Corolla Cross Hybrid vehicles. Approximately 55,000 Toyota vehicles are involved in this recall in the U.S.

A bolt inside the inverter in the hybrid powertrain can become loose and could lead to a loss of motive power or could lead to a fire when the vehicle is on. A loss of motive power while driving at higher speeds or a vehicle fire could increase the risk of a crash or an injury.

South Korean automaker Hyundai is not in a position to repurchase its former manufacturing plant in Russia due to the continuing war in Ukraine, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters, as a buyback option appears set to expire next month.

Along with its affiliate Kia, Hyundai was once the biggest foreign carmaker in Russia. But it sold its plant in St. Petersburg in 2024. Operations at the facility had been suspended since March 2022, a month after Moscow's invasion of its smaller neighbour, which provoked a backlash of Western sanctions that disrupted supply chains and payments.

The deal, which saw Hyundai sell 100% of the facility to Russia's AGR Automotive Group for a symbolic 140,000 won ($97), included a two-year buyback option. That clause expires in January.

""It is not a situation where we can buy back the shares,"" said the source, who is familiar with Hyundai's internal deliberations but asked not to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter.

Hyundai told Reuters in a statement that a final decision has not yet been made on the buyback option. AGR Automotive Group did not respond to a request for comment.

On this Monday, December 29, 2025, the markets are witnessing a coordinated retreat from the year’s most decorated champions. High-flying tech giants, led by the semiconductor titan Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA) and the electric vehicle pioneer Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA), are facing intense selling pressure as institutional and retail investors alike scramble to lock in historic gains before the calendar turns.

The movement is less a reflection of deteriorating fundamentals and more a byproduct of the complex ""plumbing"" of the financial markets. After a year where Nvidia breached a staggering $5 trillion market capitalization and Tesla successfully pivoted its narrative toward robotics and low-cost EVs, the sheer scale of their outperformance has triggered a mechanical ""de-risking"" cycle. For the broader market, this year-end volatility serves as a reminder that even the most revolutionary growth stories must eventually contend with the gravity of portfolio rebalancing and tax-efficient planning.

The Mechanics of the Year-End Exodus

The current sell-off is the culmination of a ""perfect storm"" of year-end financial mechanics. Throughout 2025, Nvidia dominated the S&P 500, at one point accounting for nearly 8% of the entire index—the highest concentration for a single company in over half a century. This massive growth forced institutional fund managers into a corner. As the year draws to a close, these managers are legally or internally mandated to rebalance their portfolios. To return to target allocations (such as the traditional 60/40 stock-bond split or sector-neutral weights), institutions are being forced to sell their ""winners""—NVDA and TSLA—to buy underperforming sectors like energy and consumer staples.

Furthermore, the ""window dressing"" period has ended. In early December, fund managers were still buying shares of Nvidia to ensure the year's top performer appeared on their annual statements to clients. However, as of December 29, that incentive has flipped. Managers are now ""locking in"" their 2025 performance bonuses by trimming positions, ensuring that a late-December dip doesn’t erode their annual returns. This shift in sentiment has been exacerbated by a ""liquidity gap"" typical of the holiday week, where lower trading volumes lead to outsized price swings.

The timeline leading to this moment was marked by a series of high-stakes catalysts. In April 2025, a ""Tariff Shock"" caused a temporary $5 trillion market wipeout, but the subsequent recovery led to new all-time highs for tech. Nvidia’s successful launch of its Blackwell architecture and the teasing of the 2026 ""Rubin"" line kept the momentum alive through the autumn. Meanwhile, Tesla’s June announcement of a $35,000 ""More Affordable Model"" helped the stock rally 45% for the year. However, as 2026 looms, the ""dream-driven"" valuations of early 2025 are being replaced by a ""debt-driven"" reality, where sticky 3.1% inflation has limited the Federal Reserve to only three rate cuts for the entire year.

Winners, Losers, and the Rebalancing Act

In this climate of profit-taking, the ""losers"" of the 2025 EV price wars are ironically providing a silver lining for investors' tax bills. Companies like Ford (NYSE: F), General Motors (NYSE: GM), and Rivian (Nasdaq: RIVN) have struggled throughout the year as Tesla’s scale and price-cutting strategies squeezed their margins. On December 29, investors are aggressively selling these ""losers"" to engage in tax-loss harvesting. By realizing losses on their legacy auto holdings, they can offset the massive capital gains taxes owed on their Nvidia and Tesla profits, a strategy that has accelerated the selling pressure across the automotive sector.

Nvidia itself, despite today’s 2.5% dip, remains the undisputed winner of the 2025 ""Inference Phase."" Its $5 billion strategic stake in Intel (Nasdaq: INTC) earlier this year secured vital manufacturing capacity, and its recent licensing deal with Groq has solidified its lead over competitors like AMD (Nasdaq: AMD). However, the company is now a victim of its own success; its sheer size makes it the first ""piggy bank"" investors raid when they need to raise cash or lower risk. Tesla faces a similar but more nuanced challenge. While its stock hit a record high of $498.83 on December 22, leaked internal memos today suggesting a 7.7% annual delivery contraction—the first in the company's history—have sent shares tumbling 4.5% in the final week of the year.

The broader semiconductor industry is also feeling the ripple effects. As investors rotate out of the ""Big Two,"" they are looking for ""value"" in neglected corners of the market. This has led to a surprising year-end resilience in legacy chipmakers and infrastructure providers who didn't participate in the AI mania of the first half of 2025. These companies are emerging as the ""relative winners"" of the December rotation, as they offer a place to park capital without the extreme valuation risk associated with the AI leaders.

Wider Significance and Historical Precedents

The current market behavior reflects a broader shift in the AI investment cycle. We are moving from a period of speculative ""dreaming"" about what AI could do to a period of rigorous accounting for what it is actually costing. The ""April Tariff Shock"" of 2025 served as a wake-up call, reminding the market that geopolitical volatility can disrupt even the most robust supply chains. The year-end profit-taking is an extension of this new-found caution. It mirrors the market dynamics of late 2021, where a period of extreme tech outperformance was followed by a sharp ""regime change"" as interest rate expectations shifted.

Historically, the ""Santa Claus Rally""—the tendency for stocks to rise in the final five trading days of December and the first two of January—usually buoys the market. However, the extreme concentration of gains in 2025 has created a ""crowded trade"" scenario. When everyone is on the same side of a trade (long AI), the exit door becomes very narrow. This has led to the current ""de-risking"" being more aggressive than in previous years. Furthermore, the expiration of federal EV tax credits in September 2025 has created a ""demand cliff"" that is now haunting Tesla’s Q4 numbers, providing a cautionary tale for how policy shifts can abruptly end a growth narrative.

From a regulatory standpoint, the year-end retreat is also being watched closely by the U.S. government. Following CEO Jensen Huang’s lobbying efforts, the pivot to allow H200 chip sales to China (with a 25% federal fee) was a major 2025 milestone. However, the high concentration of Nvidia in the S&P 500 has raised ""systemic risk"" concerns among regulators. The current sell-off might actually be a healthy development in the eyes of the Federal Reserve, as it cools down an overheated sector without requiring further interest rate hikes.

What Lies Ahead: The 2026 Outlook

Looking into the first quarter of 2026, the primary question is whether this year-end selling is a temporary ""reset"" or the start of a deeper correction. In the short term, the ""January Effect"" may take hold, where investors who sold for tax reasons in December buy back into their favorite names in the new year. This could lead to a sharp rebound for NVDA and TSLA in the first two weeks of January. However, the long-term outlook will depend on the ""Rubin"" architecture’s launch and whether Tesla can successfully scale its ""Cybercab"" mass production for 2026.

Strategic pivots will be required for the ""Magnificent Seven"" to maintain their dominance. We are likely to see a shift toward ""Inference at the Edge,"" where AI moves from massive data centers into local devices. Companies that can adapt to this decentralized AI model will be the ones to watch. Additionally, as the ""EV plateau"" continues, Tesla’s transition into a robotics and software-as-a-service (SaaS) company via FSD 14.2 will be the ultimate test of its valuation. Investors should expect 2026 to be a year of ""execution"" rather than ""expectation.""

Market opportunities may emerge in the ""AI Infrastructure"" space—the power, cooling, and physical real estate required to run the chips Nvidia sells. As the primary chip trade becomes ""crowded,"" the secondary and tertiary beneficiaries of the AI revolution may offer more attractive entry points. Conversely, the challenge for 2026 will be navigating a high-interest-rate environment that shows no signs of abating, as inflation remains the ""sticky"" ghost of 2025.

Summary and Investor Takeaways

The year-end sell-off of 2025 is a classic example of market mechanics overriding fundamental narratives. Nvidia and Tesla are not being sold because they have failed; they are being sold because they have succeeded too well, becoming victims of portfolio rebalancing, tax planning, and the natural desire to protect a year of historic gains. The key takeaway for investors is that the ""AI supercycle"" is entering a more mature, volatile phase where valuation discipline matters as much as technological innovation.

Moving forward, the market will likely remain sensitive to inflation data and geopolitical headlines. The ""Great De-Risking"" of late 2025 has cleared some of the froth from the market, potentially setting the stage for a more sustainable, albeit slower, growth trajectory in 2026. Investors should watch for the ""wash sale"" period to expire in late January, which could signal a renewed entry point for those who still believe in the long-term AI and robotics thesis.

Ultimately, the events of late 2025 underscore the importance of diversification. In a year where a single stock could move the entire S&P 500, the risks of concentration have never been clearer. As we head into 2026, the focus will shift from ""who has the best chip"" to ""who has the most sustainable business model"" in a world of high rates and high expectations.

,North Carolina and Evs,2025-12-29 15:24:52+00:00,The State,EV sales are way down. Here's why that might not be a big deal. | The State,Tik Root for Grist,,,,,https://www.thestate.com/news/business/article314030303.html,"Across the country, dealers sold about 20 percent fewer used electric cars in October than in September and saw a staggering 50 percent drop for new ones, according to the latest data.
""We're definitely gonna see a slowdown,"" Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of industry insights at Cox Automotive, told Grist.
In China, Valdez Streaty said, electric versions of cars often already cost less than their conventional counterparts.
And, like Valdez Streaty, she points to continued downward pressure on used prices expanding adoption of the technology.
In total, Valdez Streaty said, 17 states offer EV purchase incentives.","Electric vehicle sales have cratered.

Across the country, dealers sold about 20 percent fewer used electric cars in October than in September and saw a staggering 50 percent drop for new ones, according to the latest data. No one was surprised. Congress voted in July to end the federal tax credits that helped consumers afford them on Sept. 30, years before they were supposed to expire. That led to a rush of purchases before the deadline and a precipitous drop afterward.

The question now is whether this dip is a sign of a prolonged slump or a mere blip in an otherwise upward trajectory. While only time will tell, many analysts believe that electric vehicle adoption in the United States will continue to grow - albeit maybe not at the same pace seen before Congress killed the credits and automakers started second-guessing themselves.

""We're definitely gonna see a slowdown,"" Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of industry insights at Cox Automotive, told Grist. Eliminating the federal credit of $7,500 on new EVs and $4,500 on used ones is certainly taking a toll. But the price of batteries, and thus cars, also continues to come down. Used models are becoming more of a bargain, too. As of this fall, the price gap between used EVs and their gas-powered equivalents had narrowed to just $900. In China, Valdez Streaty said, electric versions of cars often already cost less than their conventional counterparts.

""It's not going to just stop,"" she said of momentum in the United States. ""It's going to be gradual adoption, but I still think we're going forward.""

Even with the decline, EVs are on pace for record sales this year and make up around 8 percent of the overall market. That is up from around 2.3 percent five years ago and a meager 0.66 percent a decade back. Valdez Streaty expects this trend to continue, as does Liz Najman, director of market insights at Recurrent, a company that provides data about EVs. She said that there are a slew of new, more affordable models, including revamped versions of the Nissan Leaf and Chevrolet Bolt, coming to market over the next year that should help drive demand.

By the end of 2026, there will be around 16 electric models available for less than $42,000 new, compared to half that this year, Najman said. And, like Valdez Streaty, she points to continued downward pressure on used prices expanding adoption of the technology. Most notably, dealerships offered a glut of lease deals on EVs in recent years, and many of those cars are approaching the end of their terms and will soon hit used lots.

""There are a lot of options for people,"" said Najam, who is optimistic about the industry's prospects. Kathy Harris, with the environmental nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council, notes that EV owners don't need to buy gas, and they avoid some basic maintenance, like oil changes. That makes cars with cords more attractive. Overall, she said, ""there are significant total cost of ownership benefits even with the higher upfront price.""

That said, the market is certainly fighting headwinds.

In addition to rescinding consumer tax credits, Republicans in Congress also stripped away many manufacturing and other corporate incentives for battery or vehicle manufacturing. They have also attempted to undercut federal fuel economy and pollution standards, which incentivize production of low- and zero-emissions vehicles. In that same bill, for example, Congress eliminated the penalties for manufacturers that violate the Corporate Average Fuel Economy, or CAFE, standards. This allows companies to produce more profitable yet less fuel-efficient vehicles, like SUVs and pickup trucks, without worry of being fined. Under President Donald Trump, the Environmental Protection Agency also revoked California's waiver to set its own emissions standards.

A number of these changes are currently the subject of litigation (California, for example, has sued the Trump administration to preserve its tailpipe rules), and analysts are watching these cases closely. The same goes for Trump's sweeping tariffs, which have also put upward pressure on the cost of all new vehicles. EVs could be particularly hard-hit, as batteries generally come from abroad and can make up as much as 40 percent of the value of the car.

All of this uncertainty has led several manufacturers to announce rollbacks in their EV plans. But Najman points out that many have stood their ground, too; she called out Hyundai in particular for expanding its EV offerings. ""These are companies that have already made their commitment to electric vehicles clear both in terms of words and actions,"" she said. This blip is ""not really going to slow down their success.""

Some states are trying to step in to fill the void the federal government has left. Since those credits went away, Colorado and Connecticut have raised their credits or rebates (by $3,000 and $500, respectively). In total, Valdez Streaty said, 17 states offer EV purchase incentives. And, the United States aside, Harris believes that manufacturers will keep producing more, and cheaper, EVs, because that's what customers in the rest of the world want as well.

""It's quite clear that this is still where the market is going,"" she said. ""I'm hopeful.""

Released this month, the biennial report, known as a greenhouse gas inventory, is the first to estimate the effects of the recent federal rollbacks on Colorado’s climate action plan.
“In terms of our GHG emissions trajectory, the impact is not as large as I feared it might be,” Will Toor, executive director of the Colorado Energy Office, said in an interview.
Its trajectory towards the next target, a 50 percent cut by 2030, is similarly about two years behind schedule, at least for now.
While the rate of growth has slowed, annual carbon emissions have continued to rise globally, reaching another all-time high in 2024.","When Colorado Democrats took full control of state government nearly seven years ago, one of the party’s top priorities in the General Assembly was the passage of a climate action plan that would commit the state to the ambitious cuts to greenhouse gas emissions recommended by climate scientists.

House Bill 19-1261, signed by Governor Jared Polis in 2019, marked the first time Colorado had codified greenhouse gas targets in state law — and the end of calendar year 2025 is the deadline to meet the first of the goals, a 26 percent reduction in statewide emissions compared to 2005 levels.

Colorado will fall short of that goal.

That outcome has been all but certain for the last few years, as the state struggled to achieve the needed cuts, especially when it came to vehicle emissions, and state officials have previously acknowledged their efforts to meet the 2025 goal were at least a year behind schedule. The target slipped further out of reach this year as President Donald Trump’s administration and Republicans in Congress rolled back an array of clean energy incentives, including tax credits for electric cars and home heating upgrades.

Still, Colorado’s top energy official said he was “pleasantly surprised” by the findings of the state’s latest comprehensive emissions report. Released this month, the biennial report, known as a greenhouse gas inventory, is the first to estimate the effects of the recent federal rollbacks on Colorado’s climate action plan.

“In terms of our GHG emissions trajectory, the impact is not as large as I feared it might be,” Will Toor, executive director of the Colorado Energy Office, said in an interview. “What the latest inventory shows is that it basically pushes us back (another) year.”

That means the state now expects to meet its 2025 target — about 103 million tons of carbon emissions, a 26 percent cut from about 140 million tons two decades ago — in 2027. Its trajectory towards the next target, a 50 percent cut by 2030, is similarly about two years behind schedule, at least for now.

“There’s a lot of uncertainty about what the federal government is going to do in the future,” Toor cautioned. “There is a lot more work that we’re going to need to do to make sure that we are accurately capturing the effects of all of the attacks on clean energy…from the Trump administration.”

Colorado’s Approach

Climate scientists have warned that to avert the most catastrophic impacts of global warming, governments around the world must cut greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030 and reach net-zero emissions by midcentury.

The world is badly off track to meet those targets. While the rate of growth has slowed, annual carbon emissions have continued to rise globally, reaching another all-time high in 2024.

Colorado’s emissions peaked around 2010 and had declined by about 16 percent from 2005 levels as of 2023, the latest year for which historical estimates are available, according to the new inventory.

Polis’ administration has embraced what it describes as a “whole-of-government approach” to climate action, pursuing a wide range of policies across different emissions sectors and regulatory bodies, including the Public Utilities Commission, the Department of Transportation, the Air Quality Control Commission and the Energy and Carbon Management Commission.

That approach hasn’t been without its critics among climate and environmental advocates, who warned as early as 2020 that the state wasn’t doing enough to meet its 2025 and 2030 goals. Advocates have been repeatedly left frustrated by the scope and ambition of the Polis administration’s climate regulations, especially at the AQCC.

U.S. Senator Michael Bennet, a Democratic candidate for governor in 2026, on December 9 announced a climate plan centered on a “cap-and-invest” program, reviving a proposal that some influential advocacy groups had hoped to enact through the AQCC after HB-1261’s passage seven years ago.

A separate report released this month by a coalition of Colorado environmental groups emphasized the need for the state to make “strategic near-term capital investments” to get back on track with its emissions goals.

“Coloradans see the impacts of climate change firsthand, in the form of more intense drought, more frequent wildfires and longer hotter summers,” Stacy Tellinghuisen, deputy director of policy development with Western Resource Advocates, said in a briefing on the new report. “Those impacts translate into real costs, but taking action — enacting forward looking policies to address climate pollution — has benefits for equity, for affordability and for air quality.”",https://www.westword.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/xcel-comanche-station-woodruff-e1767020717251.jpeg,N,,2025-12-29 10:59:49.918932

Every passing day reveals a fresh crop of news that touches our city, our region and our lives. And rest assured, the Free Press remains “On Guard” to keep you, our valued readers, informed.

I began writing this note as Free Press health reporter Kristen Jordan Shamus rushed off to 52-4 District Court in Troy to cover the preliminary hearings of four people charged in the death of 5-year-old Thomas Cooper inside a hyperbaric oxygen chamber.

Days passed, and more news followed: JC Reindl looked into a proposed data center in Southfield – one of many popping up across the state. Meanwhile, Lansing Bureau Chief Paul Egan reported on the impact of the House Appropriations committee vote to reject $645 million in ""work project"" requests from the State Budget Office to carry over funding into the 2026 fiscal year.

Later in the month, sports reporter Tony Garcia and investigative reporter Dave Boucher teamed up to stitch together what led to the dramatic firing and arrest of U-M football coach Sherrone Moore.

And on … and on.

Our Free Press team stands firmly ready to tackle the never-ending news cycle. But covering the news with urgency and persistence on all platforms is not our only objective. Our aim is to also tell the full and diverse story of our region and our time; we strive to shine a light in dark corners, to decode the indecipherable, and to inspire and entertain along the way.

For many, 2025 has been a year of tremendous change – especially in the national political sphere. As President Donald J. Trump launched his second-term agenda, the Free Press newsroom led a statewide initiative – “100 Days, 100 Michigan Voices” — seeking to elevate the voices of Michiganders. We partnered with the Lansing State Journal and Michigan’s Center for Community Journalism to conduct more than 100 face-to-face interviews, asking Michiganders their opinions of Trump’s second term in the White House, and how those opinions intersected with how they voted. We shared a robust range of their thoughts in text and on video to deepen our relationship and conversation with the audiences that we cover.

Next year, expect the Free Press to continue to seek out innovative ways to center our audiences and their diverse stories, lifestyles and opinions within our coverage. In this digital media era of hot takes and loose facts, it is vital for trusted local news sources like the Free Press to be informed by the lived experience of real people.

As we tick down to the end of the year, we must acknowledge the sunset of the Joint Operating Agreement between the Detroit Free Press and The Detroit News. While the newsrooms were always separate and competitive, the decades-long agreement allowing combined business functions ends this month.

In mid-January, the Homestyle section and the News’ opinion section will no longer be available in the Free Press print and e-newspapers. However, starting in February, Free Press subscribers will enjoy an enhanced Sunday news product, which will include more suburban news, new home and garden content, more entertainment, an expanded editorial section and the Free Press’ trademark investigative journalism. We look forward to sharing a fresh approach and providing readers with more of the content that matters to them.

I started this note in the midst of news. And as I close, news still swirls: Investigative journalist Violet Ikonomova covered a news conference where Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan said the Detroit Police Department and state environmental regulators are looking into two companies believed to have dumped toxic dirt into Detroit neighborhood demolition sites. Auto critic Mark Phelan put the finishing touches on his picks for the annual Car, Truck and Utility vehicle of the year, while autos team newbie Liam Rappleye waxed poetic about a custom Chrysler mash-up of minivans whose frontend and backend are mirror images.

And on and on ...

That’s all the time Donald Trump needed to crush the only major climate law the United States ever managed to pass. It was swift work, using a sledgehammer and not a scalpel, and now the energy transition will have to make do with the fragments of the law that remain.

The words bleak and dispiriting come to mind. How else to describe the fact that the U.S. entered the year implementing an ambitious if inadequate decarbonization law, and is now exiting 2025 with that law all but repealed?

But there were also some reasons to be hopeful about the energy transition this year — if you knew where to look.

Let’s start with the numbers. During a year full of headline-grabbing destruction of U.S. clean energy policy, renewables still led the way. Through November, a whopping 92% of all new electricity capacity built in the U.S. came in the form of solar, batteries, and wind power. Electric vehicle sales hit a record, too — nearly 440,000 in the third quarter of the year — though the surge was driven in large part by consumers rushing to buy EVs before the disappearance of a federal tax credit axed by Trump.

There were also intriguing moments of alignment between Trump’s “energy dominance” agenda and the transition away from fossil fuels. Geothermal and nuclear are two sources of carbon-free energy that the administration has, for whatever reasons, deemed desirable. So while the One Big Beautiful Bill Act eviscerated much of President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act, it spared tax credits for geothermal systems. And Trump has not only preserved Biden-era funding for nuclear projects but expanded it — possibly by orders of magnitude if an $80 billion plan for partially state-owned nuclear reactors actually happens.

The most important thing we saw this year is that Trump simply can’t stop the energy transition. Sure, he can slow it. He already has. But try as the administration might, there are forces at play bigger and more stubborn even than politics.

To be specific: Electricity demand is growing quickly in the U.S., and clean energy is the least expensive and most readily available way to keep pace.

The Trump administration would certainly prefer to meet rising demand with coal and gas, but in many cases it’s simply impractical.

Coal is increasingly the most expensive form of electricity. Gas, for better or for worse, certainly will help meet some of this new demand — but it faces very real supply-chain constraints. Gas turbines are sold out among major manufacturers, with wait times stretching as long as seven years.

When the country is clamoring for more electrons and voters are increasingly upset about rising power bills, and the only thing that can be built quickly is solar and storage, renewables will simply have to be built. (They’ll just cost more than they would have without Trump.)",https://media.zenfs.com/en/canary_media_articles_453/6f3dc22dfd913cc623114badf7171a4f,N,,2025-12-29 11:59:09.425898

While fully electric cars and trucks made up 10% of all auto sales in the United States in the third quarter, another 15% of transactions were for hybrid vehicles.
Kunes is even more bullish; he figures in the near future, more than half of his business will be hybrid vehicles.
Ultimately, hybrid cars and trucks may prove to be as powerful as federal incentives in fueling EV sales.
In September, some 57% of car shoppers were considering a fully electric auto, according to JD Power.","Like most U.S. car dealers, Scott Kunes has some electric vehicle whiplash.

In the third quarter, he sold EVs like ice cream at the beach. However, after federal purchase incentives expired at the end of September, those models have been tough to move at his company’s 50 or so Midwest stores selling about 20 different brands, from Mitsubishi to Mercedes-Benz.

But buyers aren’t necessarily turning to gas guzzlers. On Kunes’ lots, hybrid vehicles are in high demand, a preference that’s playing out across the country. While fully electric cars and trucks made up 10% of all auto sales in the United States in the third quarter, another 15% of transactions were for hybrid vehicles.

The EV market is slowing in the United States, but analysts expect hybrid sales to continue accelerating. CarGurus Inc., a digital listings platform that covers most of the U.S. auto market, predicts nearly one in six new cars next year will be a hybrid, as automakers greenlight more and better machines with the technology. And though these cars and trucks will still burn gas, they will quietly move the needle on both transportation emissions and the transition to fully electric cars and trucks.

Kunes is even more bullish; he figures in the near future, more than half of his business will be hybrid vehicles. “We have so much investment in EV and battery technology, and we need to figure out the best possible use of it,” he said. “There’s a lot to be said for hybrids becoming the most dominant powertrain out there and real soon.”

With federal purchase incentives worth up to $7,500 wiped out by the Trump administration, EV sales were expected to plunge 30% in the fourth quarter and remain flat through much of next year. But Americans worried about affordability see hybrids as a pragmatic way to cut fuel expenses and emissions.

“They offer consumers a little bit of everything,” said Peter Nagle, associate director of Americas demand forecasting at S&P Global Mobility. “I think the demand is only going to keep going from here. Their utilitarian nature “might appeal more to rural, red state customers,” he added.

CarGurus calls hybrids the success story of 2025. Indeed, the fastest-selling car in the country this year has been the Hyundai Palisade Hybrid; it sat on lots for fewer than 14 days on average.

Of the roughly 390 distinct car models on the U.S. market, roughly 87 are available with hybrid technology, nearly 50% more options than drivers had five years ago, according to Edmunds.com. While carmakers have struggled to turn a profit on fully electric vehicles, analysts say their investments in batteries and electric motors are helping them sell more and better hybrid machines.

It’s also increasingly difficult to discern a hybrid from a solely gas-powered model, said Scott Hardman, assistant director of the Electric Vehicle Research Center at the University of California at Davis. Carmakers today often don’t even label a hybrid as such. Consider Toyota’s RAV4, one of the best-selling vehicles in America. The 2026 version of the SUV comes in six different variants, all of which include an electric motor and a gas tank.

“A hybrid is just a regular car now,” Hardman said. “You can buy one by accident.”

Kunes, the Midwest dealer, said most of his customers don’t pay much attention to how the vehicle propels itself; they’re just looking for the most affordable option. “People don’t necessarily come in looking for a hybrid vehicle,” he explained, “but they don’t mind taking one.”

While not as clean as an electric vehicle, hybrids offer sneaky carbon cuts as well. Americans, on average, drive about 38 miles a day, which requires about one gallon of gas in most basic hybrids. Contemporary plug-in hybrids, which can run on all-battery power, can cover almost that entire range without the gas engine kicking in. And a small crowd of cars will do even better, stretching their batteries well over 40 miles per charge.

All told, hybridization can reduce the carbon dioxide emissions of a vehicle by roughly 20% to 30%, according to the International Council on Clean Transportation.

And Americans will soon have even more hybrids to choose from. As automakers retool their paths to electrification, many are doubling down on hybrids and acknowledging that they will be more than a brief stepping stone in the transition to full EVs.

This month, Ford Motor Co. said it would scrap its electric F-150 Lightning pickup and use its assembly lines to stamp out a new extended-range hybrid pickup, in part because it had invested so much in battery capacity. By 2030, Ford expects half of its global sales to be fully or partially electrified vehicles.

Toyota Motor Corp. is already at that level, in part thanks to all those hybrid RAV4s. Meanwhile, Honda Motor Co. Ltd. is steering for the same lane, basing its entire business on hybrids until at least 2030.

Ultimately, hybrid cars and trucks may prove to be as powerful as federal incentives in fueling EV sales. Around one-third of hybrid drivers transition to a fully electric vehicle when they next switch cars. In September, some 57% of car shoppers were considering a fully electric auto, according to JD Power. However, among hybrid households, that share was almost 70%.

“I don’t necessarily think you buy that car and fall in love with that tiny electric motor,” Hardman said. “But after a while, people think, ‘Actually, driving electric is pretty nice. One thing I don’t like about my hybrid is when the engine kicks on, or I have to go to a gas station.’”","https://www.detroitnews.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/02/04/PDTN/78220196007-ap-25023690791910.jpg?crop=3496,1966,x2,y290&width=3200&height=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-29 11:00:26.774781

United States, a case that could further redefine the boundaries of federal agency authority and reshape how regulations affecting business, labor, and environmental compliance are crafted and enforced. While the dispute does not center on energy or environmental policy directly, its outcome could influence how future climate, labor, and ESG-related rules are challenged—and upheld.

At issue is whether federal agencies exceeded their statutory authority in issuing regulations that the Chamber argues impose obligations not clearly authorized by Congress. The case arrives amid broader judicial skepticism toward expansive administrative interpretation, continuing a trend that has already altered the regulatory landscape.

The Legal Question at the Center of the Case

The Chamber’s challenge focuses on whether agencies may rely on broad or implied statutory language to justify far-reaching rules, or whether Congress must speak with greater specificity when delegating regulatory power. The case builds on recent precedent signaling that courts may no longer defer as readily to agency interpretations of ambiguous statutes.

This framework places renewed emphasis on the “major questions” doctrine, under which courts require clear congressional authorization before allowing agencies to regulate issues of vast economic or political significance.

Why Business Groups Are Watching Closely

For business and industry groups, the case represents an opportunity to rein in regulatory expansion that has increasingly occurred through rulemaking rather than legislation. The Chamber argues that uncertainty around agency authority complicates compliance planning, increases litigation risk, and exposes companies to shifting obligations that can change across administrations.

A ruling favoring the Chamber could embolden additional challenges to federal rules across labor, environmental, financial, and disclosure regimes—particularly where agencies rely on long-standing but broadly interpreted statutory mandates.

Regulatory Implications

Although the case is not an environmental dispute on its face, the implications for sustainability-related regulation are significant. Many climate, emissions, and disclosure rules depend on agency interpretations of statutes enacted decades ago, often before modern ESG frameworks existed.

If the Court tightens limits on agency discretion, regulators may face higher hurdles when advancing new environmental or climate-related requirements without explicit congressional direction. That could slow the pace of regulatory change or shift responsibility back to lawmakers—introducing new uncertainty for companies attempting to plan long-term sustainability strategies.

What This Means for Compliance and Risk Teams

For corporate legal, compliance, and sustainability teams, the case underscores the importance of monitoring not just individual regulations, but the legal foundations underpinning them. A decision narrowing agency authority could:

Increase regulatory volatility as existing rules are challenged

Delay or invalidate forthcoming ESG or climate disclosures

Create uneven compliance environments across jurisdictions

At the same time, a ruling upholding agency authority would reaffirm the current regulatory model, reinforcing the role of federal agencies as primary drivers of policy implementation.

A Broader Signal from the Court

Taken together with recent administrative law decisions, Chamber of Commerce v. United States reflects a judiciary increasingly willing to police the separation of powers between Congress and the executive branch. Regardless of outcome, the case adds another layer of legal context that businesses must factor into regulatory forecasting.

For now, the case serves as a reminder that regulatory risk is no longer confined to rulemaking dockets alone—it is increasingly shaped by the courts that determine how far agencies may go.",https://alpha.creativecirclecdn.com/environment/original/20251228-142146-411-The%20image%20depicts%20a%20gavel%20resting%20on%20top%20of%20a%20stack%20of%20legal%20documents%2C%20symbolizing%20the%20Supreme%20Court%27s%20role%20in%20determining%20federal%20agency%20authority..jpg,N,,2025-12-29 11:13:06.890782

Expanding access to renewable propane While renewable propane is already in use today, its production is growing rapidly to meet rising demand.
According to the World Liquid Gas Association, renewable propane could meet half the world’s demand for propane by 2050.
Researchers are investigating new renewable feedstocks and refining manufacturing techniques to make the production of renewable propane cleaner and more scalable.","With lower emissions and proven reliability, it’s the ready-now solution for cleaner port operations.

As demand for cleaner energy grows, port authorities and terminal operators face the challenge of finding environmentally friendly options without increasing budgets or sacrificing productivity. Propane has met these performance criteria at ports for decades, powering everything from terminal tractors and forklifts to shore power and generators. It reduces emissions while ensuring critical operational uptime, even when ports are experiencing peak volumes.

Now, renewable propane, an ultra-low-carbon energy source, is available to help ports reduce emissions even further. Renewable propane offers the same benefits as conventional propane — reliability, portability, and power — but with significantly fewer emissions when compared with other energy sources.

What is renewable propane?

Renewable propane is produced from feedstocks such as camelina plant oil, used cooking oil, vegetable oil, soybean oil, animal fats, and tallow. The result is the power and portability of conventional propane with a greatly reduced carbon footprint.

The carbon intensity of renewable propane — the amount of carbon emitted for every unit of energy produced — is up to four times lower than conventional propane and five times lower than diesel at the point of combustion. The fuel ranks among the lowest in carbon intensity, with a score between 20 and 43 (depending on the feedstock). Compare that with a score of 79 for conventional propane and natural gas — both of which are 20 percent cleaner than gasoline and diesel (each rated at 100). At 130, the average carbon intensity score of the U.S. electrical grid is the highest among all options when considering total lifecycle emissions.

Both renewable propane and conventional propane offer port authorities the benefit of reduced emissions beyond greenhouse gases. A real-world study conducted by PERC found propane port tractors produce 99 percent fewer nitrogen oxides and nearly eliminate particulate matter emissions compared with diesel. As port authorities look for ways to improve their sustainability, renewable and conventional propane are well positioned to provide fleets with the clean power they need without compromising reliability or performance.

Clean energy without tradeoffs

Ports operate on tight schedules and tighter margins. There’s little room for downtime or costly transitions to new fuel systems. That’s why port authorities and terminal operators need environmentally friendly solutions that don’t compromise performance or wipe out profits.

Because renewable propane is chemically identical to conventional propane, ports can use it in existing propane engines, fueling dispensers, and storage systems. For ports already using propane, adopting renewable propane is a seamless process that won’t pause operations and doesn’t require any new training, equipment, or infrastructure costs. For ports new to propane, setup is just a fraction of those associated with electric or other alternative fuel systems.

This also means port authorities experience all the same benefits of conventional propane when they upgrade to renewable, including reliability. Propane is stored on site, so it’s always ready when needed, even during grid interruptions. Refueling is fast and efficient, ensuring material handling equipment stays online during peak periods.

Most importantly, renewable propane allows ports to reduce emissions today without waiting for future technologies to catch up. It offers a realistic, cost-effective path to cleaner operations while maintaining the uptime, flexibility, and performance that port operators depend on every day.

Expanding access to renewable propane

While renewable propane is already in use today, its production is growing rapidly to meet rising demand. The U.S. produces more than 4.5 million gallons annually, and that number is expected to reach 100 million gallons within the next few years. As more production facilities come online and supply chains mature, renewable propane will become an even more accessible and cost-competitive option for ports. According to the World Liquid Gas Association, renewable propane could meet half the world’s demand for propane by 2050.

This growth is driven by market demand for cleaner fuels and technological innovation. Researchers are investigating new renewable feedstocks and refining manufacturing techniques to make the production of renewable propane cleaner and more scalable. Camelina, a non-food oilseed cover crop, is a particularly promising source for renewable propane.

Camelina produces 40 percent oil, twice that of soybeans, and the remaining meal and husks are used for mulch and livestock feed to maximize resource efficiency. Camelina-based renewable propane has one of the lowest carbon intensities, with studies showing it can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 60 percent compared to petroleum fuel.

Recent studies show that renewable propane can be produced from other nontraditional sources, including the breakdown of plastics such as polyethylene and polypropylene and the conversion of captured carbon dioxide. These methods create circular production pathways that further lower lifecycle emissions.

Moving to a clean energy future

Above all, port authorities are responsible for ensuring the continuity of global trade and operations. With renewable propane, they can make progress toward global emissions goals, too. Ports that want to lead the clean energy transition with confidence, performance, and reliability will find renewable propane ready when they are.",https://images.marinelink.com/images/maritime/w800/image-courtesy-166676.jpg,N,,2025-12-29 10:59:53.070976

On December 5, 2025, the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance (OECA) issued a memorandum that directs all EPA staff responsible for civil judicial and administrative enforcement activities to prioritize a ""compliance first"" approach to enforcement.

The memorandum criticizes previous enforcement approaches which pursued findings of violation or orders that prolonged negotiations and delayed actual compliance. Going forward, however, the EPA's primary focus in all inspection, investigation, and enforcement activities is ""achieving and ensuring timely compliance."" The memorandum outlines six key factors that will guide EPA staff in their compliance-first operating framework:

Compliance Assistance Toolkit. EPA will prioritize deployment of its ""compliance assistance tools,"" including proactive outreach, technical assistance, and training. EPA will also promote voluntary audits to encourage regulated entities to proactively identify and correct compliance issues.

State Partner Coordination. EPA will demonstrate ""proper deference and support"" to state and local leads who have primary jurisdiction over environmental programs, ensuring consistency in compliance determinations and in enforcement of federal environmental law.

Open Communication. EPA will maintain transparent communication with states, tribes, and regulated entities in order to avoid duplicative enforcement activities and unnecessary contradictions. EPA will also operate a ""no surprises"" framework by maintaining open communication with regulated entities throughout the inspection and enforcement process.

Finding of Violation. Findings of violation must be ""clear and unambiguous, well-tailored, and based on the 'best reading' of the relevant statute and regulation,"" which will expedite compliance and reduce time and expense in litigating interpretations that seek to broaden statutory or regulatory interpretations beyond plain meaning. If a regulated entity raises concerns regarding EPA's application of a statute or regulation to its specific case, ""such questions must be elevated immediately for further analysis.""

Compliance Requirements and Injunctive Relief. When formal enforcement is necessary, the primary focus of the strategic negotiations and litigation must be achieving timely compliance in the most efficient and economic means possible. In particular, the memorandum notes that injunctive relief provisions ""shall be based on the best, most defensible interpretation of the law,"" and rescinds previous guidance on expansive injunctive relief remedies. The memorandum also mandates a pause on the use of Supplemental Environmental Projects (SEPs) in settlements.

Reasoned Decision Making. When making decisions on noncompliance determinations and the appropriate means for achieving compliance, EPA must apply the ""LEAPS"" factors, using Law, Evidence, Analysis, Programmatic Impacts, and Stakeholder Impacts to ""ensure sound and responsive decisions.""

The memorandum is effective immediately and applies to all ongoing and future civil and administrative enforcement matters. Notably, the memorandum states that it is not legally binding but is rather ""intended to improve the internal management of EPA.""

""This policy reinforces prioritizing environmental compliance across all OECA civil judicial and administrative enforcement activities in the most efficient, most economical, and swiftest means possible, while ensuring that our actions align with the clearest, most defensible interpretations of our statutory and regulatory mandates.""

Clean energy is surging despite political attacks. But a slowdown may be looming

Topline:

The U.S. is forecast to add a lot less power from renewables than analysts previously expected.

Why now: Over the past year, the Trump administration and Congressional Republicans have waged a sweeping campaign against renewable energy, throwing a fast-growing industry into turmoil.

Why it matters: All this is occurring as electricity demand is rising faster than it has in decades. Some experts warn that limiting new power supplies could have broad economic consequences, including higher electricity costs and slower business growth. So far, it's unclear what the Trump campaign against renewables will mean for consumers or grid reliability.",https://scpr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/582847d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8640x4536+0+612/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fdd%2Ff1%2F6ccb27ca4fbd96b3d4bcc626e6ea%2Fap25168671048385.jpg,N,,2025-12-29 12:59:37.567183

Thirty-seven per cent said it should support jobs and production specifically in Canada's auto parts industry.
More than half, 58 per cent, also supported diversification of auto manufacturing into defence manufacturing to save jobs.
""Canadians are calling for strategic investments that safeguard manufacturing jobs while strengthening the foundation for the entire automotive ecosystem.""
Meanwhile, 55 per cent of Canadians in the market for a new vehicle plan to buy an environmentally-friendly car next.","According to a survey by KPMG, six in ten Canadians plan to buy a vehicle in the next five years, and many prospective buyers aren't just paying attention to the model, but also where that vehicle was made.

The survey of 2,000 Canadians, taken between November 7 and November 17, suggests that 72 per cent believe it is either very or somewhat important to them that the vehicle is assembled or built in Canada.

""With U.S. tariffs disrupting the industry, Canadians in the market for a new vehicle are looking to the brands they trust at prices they can afford -- and increasingly, where those vehicles are built,"" said Partner and National Automotive Sector Leader at KMPG Canada, Dave Power. ""Car buyers are looking for vehicles that meet their lifestyle, are affordable, and have a positive economic impact on the country. It's not surprising that Toyota and Honda, which each have a large manufacturing presence in Ontario, resonate most with Canadian consumers.""

At the same time, Power said trust in the Detroit Big 3 is eroding as Canadians perceive a lack of commitment to keep jobs in Canada.

""As consumer concerns collide with ongoing trade tensions and tariffs threatening to upend decades of cross-border stability, Canada's automotive sector needs to carefully consider its future and what changes might be warranted,"" continued Power. ""Canadians are calling for a new automotive strategy, which prioritizes domestic manufacturing, secures jobs, provides long-term resilience, and positions Canada as a leader in electric vehicles and battery production.""

A majority of respondents stated they would support higher tariffs on Detroit 3 automakers who cut production in Canada.

Fifty-five per cent of those who responded to KPMG's survey believe Canada could become a world leader in electric vehicles, in a bid to reduce its reliance on the U.S. auto industry. Almost as many think governments should make it a priority.

""And with billions already committed to new battery and EV charging facilities in Ontario and Quebec, momentum is building toward a made-in-Canada ecosystem for cleantech exports in renewable energy, EVs, and electrification,"" added Power. ""We have everything to lead the EV transition, including critical minerals, innovation, talent, and manufacturing capacity. What is needed is a clear roadmap to accelerate Canada's leadership.""

The survey shows 60 per cent think governments should provide financial support and incentives to keep automakers building in Canada. Thirty-seven per cent said it should support jobs and production specifically in Canada's auto parts industry. Only seven per cent think jobs and production among Detroit automakers should be prioritized. Almost half of the respondents support removing tariffs on EVs from China.

More than half, 58 per cent, also supported diversification of auto manufacturing into defence manufacturing to save jobs.

""People want long-term strategy, not short-term patches,"" said Power. ""Canadians are calling for strategic investments that safeguard manufacturing jobs while strengthening the foundation for the entire automotive ecosystem.""

The survey also asked Canadians about next year's review of the Canada-U.S.-Mexico Agreement. Seventy-two per cent fear vehicle prices will rise if Canada loses protections under the new agreement, while 51 per cent don't think Canada's automotive industry will survive without trade protections or a new trade agreement with the U.S.

KPMG's Partner, Trade and Customs, believes the review may also provide manufacturers with opportunities.

""If the CUSMA rules of origin change substantially to require even more North American content, this could have a dramatic impact on existing automotive supply chains,"" Joy Nott said. ""This disruption would require a search for new North American suppliers to replace overseas manufacturing. While disruptive and likely to increase costs, this change could also create opportunities for Canadian manufacturers to expand and diversify their business.""

Meanwhile, 55 per cent of Canadians in the market for a new vehicle plan to buy an environmentally-friendly car next.

Bringing new opportunities and challenges, the AI revolution is taking off and pushing power demand to new heights.
However, new natural gas plant development has slowed significantly in recent years for a variety of policy- and market-related reasons.
In the latest long-term demand outlook, PJM projects that overall power demand across its footprint will jump nearly 60 percent over the next decade.
That’s the biggest barrier to advancing American energy: permitting.","Today, our state and nation stand at a critical crossroads – one that will determine whether the U.S. continues to lead the world in affordable, reliable energy or falls behind due to bureaucratic red tape and gridlock.

Just 15 years ago, Pennsylvania produced less than 2 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas.

Now, Pennsylvania produces more than 20 billion cubic feet per day, enough to supply approximately 100 million U.S. homes with energy for one day. This surge has helped take America from a position of scarcity and dependence to one of abundance and global leadership.

In the Keystone State, natural gas and oil supports 400,000 jobs and adds $40 billion to the state’s economy every year.

Nationwide, the industry supports 10 million American jobs and contributes nearly $1.8 trillion to the U.S. GDP – about 8 percent of the entire economy. In testimony before the Pennsylvania House Republican Policy Committee’s recent public hearing on energy affordability and reliability, American Petroleum Institute‘s Vice President of Natural Gas Markets, Rob Jennings, referred to this as the “first 8 percent,” because “nothing else in the economy moves without energy.”

Energy is the foundation of our modern economy – from the days of the Industrial Revolution to the invention of the internet and now the AI era. Bringing new opportunities and challenges, the AI revolution is taking off and pushing power demand to new heights.

Many of the energy challenges we face in Pennsylvania mirror those in other regions of the country. Residential electric utility bills, for example, have risen far faster than inflation in recent years – and while some of the cost drivers are unavoidable, others are self-inflicted.

Between 2010 to 2020, gas-fired generating capacity in Pennsylvania and the rest of PJM Interconnection, the largest regional transmission organization in the U.S., surged as utilities and independent power producers responded to a tightening regional electricity market and leveraged abundant natural gas from the Marcellus shale basin. However, new natural gas plant development has slowed significantly in recent years for a variety of policy- and market-related reasons.

Although the impact of this slowdown in bringing new natural gas plants onto the grid didn’t have an immediate impact, that is changing fast amid forecasts of rapidly rising electricity demand, which is being driven by advancements in manufacturing, innovations in AI and electrification. In the latest long-term demand outlook, PJM projects that overall power demand across its footprint will jump nearly 60 percent over the next decade. Ninety-five percent of new power demand through 2030 is expected to come from data centers.

Across the Keystone State, including Cumberland, Dauphin and Lancaster counties, AI data centers and other power-intensive projects are being proposed and built, generating new economic opportunities and jobs for Pennsylvanians. But this progress also provides opportunities for Pennsylvania energy.

This growth in power demand is extraordinary, yet it is an indication of a growing economy and job creation – a generational opportunity to advance American energy and innovation.

Pennsylvania has and will continue to play a key role in powering our lives with its abundant supply of shale gas. The question is, can we build the infrastructure needed to move energy from where it’s produced to where it’s needed?

That’s the biggest barrier to advancing American energy: permitting. Meaningful, durable permitting reforms at the state and federal level are needed to allow for timely buildout of infrastructure, such as pipelines, transmission lines, natural gas storage, power plants – even roads and bridges.

Projects are often languishing in years of duplicative review or endless litigation. A pipeline that should take less than a year to permit can stretch to a decade, delaying the delivery of affordable, reliable energy that American consumers and businesses count on.

Congress must act on commonsense deadlines and predictable permitting processes to help ensure projects are built in years, not decades. Three key areas must be addressed: set deadlines and enforce them, stop endless lawsuits and limit reviews to direct project impacts.

Pennsylvania doesn’t just have the energy resources America needs – it has the leadership to show how responsible energy development powers prosperity.

Everything is pointing to the fact that we need more energy, and that requires more infrastructure. Permitting reform is the key to opening the door to energy abundance and prosperity. Because when America builds, America wins.

New Data from MRD Study Reinforces IMNN-001's Promise as a Potential Breakthrough Immunotherapy

LAWRENCEVILLE, N.J., Dec. 29, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- IMUNON , Inc. (Nasdaq: IMNN )

Dear Valued Shareholders,

2025, A Year of Momentum: Advancing Toward a Potential Breakthrough in Ovarian Cancer Treatment

As we close out 2025, I am excited to reflect on a year marked by significant clinical progress, robust data validation, and strategic execution that has significantly strengthened IMUNON's position. Our focus on harnessing the power to activate the body's immune system against cancer has yielded compelling results, bringing us closer to delivering innovative therapies that could transform patient outcomes and create substantial value for you, our shareholders. Very importantly, we believe that we are well positioned for an equally successful 2026.

One Step Closer to BLA Filing: Strong Progress in the Phase 3 OVATION 3 Study

This year, we initiated and advanced our pivotal Phase 3 OVATION 3 Study evaluating IMNN-001 in combination with standard-of-care neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy for women with newly diagnosed advanced ovarian cancer. Enrollment continues to generate strong interest, underscoring the enthusiasm from investigators and the medical community for this potential sea change in the standard of care for this underserved population. This momentum is another metric illustrating the meaningful clinical outcomes observed in our Phase 2 OVATION 2 Study, where IMNN-001 demonstrated a 13-month extension in median overall survival (OS) in the intent-to-treat population (hazard ratio of 0.70). In patients receiving PARP inhibitors as maintenance therapy, the median OS in the IMNN-001 arm has not yet been reached, with all patients having surpassed 31 months of follow-up and numerous patients progressing beyond five years (vs. 37 months in the control arm; hazard ratio of 0.42). These results, presented at ASCO and published in Gynecologic Oncology, continue to highlight IMNN-001's potential to redefine frontline treatment, where no meaningful advances have occurred in over 30 years.

Renewing the Promise of Immunotherapy: New Insights from the Ongoing MRD Study

Building on this foundation, new data from our ongoing minimal residual disease (MRD) study—conducted in partnership with Break Through Cancer—further renew the promise of a novel immunotherapy for frontline ovarian cancer. Translational data demonstrate IMNN-001's broad impact on the tumor microenvironment, with definitive evidence that treatment leads to IL-12 production by macrophages in tumor tissue, boosting T cell cytotoxic functions. Specifically:

Macrophage activation: IMNN-001 induces robust expression of IL12A and IL12B in macrophages of peritoneal fluid and tumor tissue, stimulating a cascade of anti-tumor cytokines, including interferon-gamma, and resulting in potent macrophage and T cell activation.

Tumor microenvironment remodeling: The tumor immune microenvironment becomes more inflamed following exposure to IMNN-001, effectively turning ""cold"" tumors ""hot"" by activating both innate and adaptive immune systems.

Preliminary clinical readouts from the MRD study are equally encouraging, showing a lower MRD positivity rate, a lower percentage of tumor-containing biopsies in MRD-positive patients, higher complete response scores (CRS) at cytoreduction, and a higher probability of progression-free survival (PFS) with IMNN-001 compared to the control arm. The positive tolerability profile of IMNN-001 continues, including in combination with standard-of-care chemotherapy plus bevacizumab and also in the maintenance setting, with no cytokine release syndrome, systemic toxicities, or serious immune-related adverse events observed.

The consistency of evidence across our trials—OVATION 1, OVATION 2, MRD and now OVATION 3 —with IMNN-001's favorable benefit/risk profile, gives us strong hope for a potential breakthrough in treating newly diagnosed ovarian cancer, a disease affecting 20,000 women annually in the U.S. and 300,000 worldwide, with high recurrence and low five-year survival rates.

TheraPlas Platform: Expanding Horizons Beyond Ovarian Cancer

Our TheraPlas platform, which enables localized, durable expression of interleukin-12 (IL-12) and other therapeutic payloads, continues to validate its potential. By targeting the tumor site directly, our unique approach avoids the toxicities of systemic immunotherapies while remodeling the microenvironment to generate anti-tumor responses. We have an extensive set of completed animal experiments with IMNN-001 in additional tumor types and TheraPlas for other DNA plasmid delivered payloads, which could unlock growth opportunities through partnerships, including potential licensing in Asia-Pacific regions.

Financial Discipline and Outstanding Execution

Throughout 2025, we maintained financial discipline, conserving cash while securing resources to support our pivotal trial. Our cGMP-compliant manufacturing has reduced costs significantly, which may position us for high gross margins upon potential FDA approval. The resiliency in our share price, even amidst what we believe to be extreme short positions, and interest from institutional investors reflect growing confidence in our science and strategy. We remain committed to strategic funding of the OVATION 3 trial, estimated at $30 million for the HRD+ subgroup focus, with options for expansion.

Looking Ahead: A Pivotal 2026 and Beyond

As we enter 2026, IMUNON is poised for key milestones, including continued enrollment in OVATION 3 with interim analyses potentially enabling early stopping and BLA filing in the HRD+ population. We anticipate additional data presentations at major conferences, further translational insights from OVATION 2 tumor samples, and progress on business development initiatives. With Fast Track and Orphan Drug designations in place, we are dedicated to bringing IMNN-001 to patients in need while driving sustainable shareholder value.

On behalf of the IMUNON team, thank you for your unwavering support. Together, we are on the cusp of redefining cancer care.

Sincerely,

Stacy R. Lindborg, Ph.D.

President and Chief Executive Officer

ATHENS, Greece, Dec. 29, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Capital Clean Energy Carriers Corp. (the “Company”, “CCEC”, “we” or “us”) (NASDAQ: CCEC), an international owner of ocean-going vessels, today announced it has ordered three latest technology LNG carriers (“LNG/C”) to be built at HD Hyundai Samho Co., Ltd (“Hyundai”) in South Korea, scheduled for delivery in 2028 and 2029.

CCEC has secured three LNG/C berths at Hyundai, with one vessel scheduled for delivery in the third quarter of 2028 and two further deliveries in the first quarter of 2029. The en-bloc ship building price of these vessels is $769.5 million. The vessels have been designed to incorporate a number of upgrades in their specification and are expected to rank amongst the most efficient LNG/Cs in the global fleet in terms of fuel consumption and boil-off rates.

With its latest order for three additional LNG/Cs, the Company reaffirms its strategic position as the largest US listed LNG shipping company with 12 LNG/Cs currently in the water and nine LNG/Cs on order (“Newbuild LNG/Cs”). The Company’s newbuilding deliveries span from the third quarter of 2026 to the first quarter of 2029, which coincides with the anticipated expansion of LNG liquefaction capacity from 493 mtpa today to at least 649 mtpa by 2030. In addition, CCEC has on order an additional 10 gas carriers, including four handy LCO 2 /multi-gas carriers and six dual-fuel medium gas carriers (the “Gas Fleet”), with deliveries starting in the first quarter of 2026. The CCEC fleet benefits from approximately $3.0 billion of contracted revenue and an average remaining charter duration of 6.9 years, underpinning the Company’s ongoing fleet expansion strategy. The Company’s strategy is to create shareholder value through creating scarcity value, while retaining commercial optionality via a disciplined mix of contracted and open vessel capacity. CCEC has delivered on this strategy by securing long term employment during 2025 for three of its newbuilding LNG/Cs, whilst simultaneously improving the financial strength of the company by recycling capital from its legacy container fleet.

As a result of the contracting of the three additional LNG/Cs, our capital expenditure schedule (“CAPEX”) has been revised as follows:

CAPEX Schedule of CCEC in USD million, as of December 29, 2025:

2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 TOTAL Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Newbuild LNG/C - 61.9 51.2 393.7 - 702.2 24.7 - 49.3 24.7 24.7 211.0 - 372.8 1,916.2 Gas Fleet 7.8 74.0 105.4 115.4 47.7 89.3 46.9 35.9 - - - - - - 522.4 TOTAL 7.8 135.9 156.6 509.1 47.7 791.5 71.6 35.9 49.3 24.7 24.7 211.0 - 372.8 2,438.6

The Company has paid by December 29, 2025, $386.1 million in advance to shipyards towards the acquisition of its under-construction fleet.

Jerry Kalogiratos, CEO of CCEC, commented: “ This is an opportunistic transaction for CCEC, which closely aligns with our executed strategy and forward objectives. I believe that we have secured attractive pricing and payment terms for state of the art, high specification vessels, whose deliveries we expect to coincide with increased demand for LNG shipping from a number of LNG projects that are expected to come online in this timeline. Notably, this transaction allows CCEC to selectively contract the most attractive specification LNG/Cs for charterers, to be delivered at the most undersupplied part of the forward curve.”

About Capital Clean Energy Carriers Corp.

Capital Clean Energy Carriers Corp. (NASDAQ: CCEC), an international shipping company, is one of the world’s leading platforms of gas carriage solutions with a focus on energy transition. CCEC’s in-the-water fleet includes 14 high specification vessels, including 12 latest generation LNG/Cs and two legacy Neo-Panamax container vessels, one of which has been agreed to be sold. In addition, CCEC’s under-construction fleet includes nine additional latest generation LNG/Cs, six dual-fuel medium gas carriers and four handy LCO 2 /multi-gas carriers, to be delivered between the first quarter of 2026 and the first quarter of 2029.

Miami, FL, Dec. 29, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NextNRG, Inc. (NASDAQ: NXXT), a pioneer in AI-driven energy innovation transforming how energy is produced, managed, and delivered, today announced it has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with A123 Systems, LLC (A123) a battery manufacturer and energy storage technology leader with advanced LFP chemistry, to support the deployment of battery energy storage systems manufactured in the United States.

NextNRG and A123 believe this collaboration positions them to capitalize on accelerating domestic demand for battery storage while strengthening the U.S. energy supply chain. By prioritizing domestically manufactured systems, the collaboration is expected to help avoid additional import tariffs, mitigate trade-related exposure, and support predictable project execution at scale as demand for battery storage continues to expand nationwide.

The MOU establishes a preliminary framework for evaluating large-scale storage opportunities that prioritize U.S.-based manufacturing and domestic sourcing. By deploying A123 battery systems produced within the United States, the companies aim to enhance supply chain resilience, reduce geopolitical and trade-related risks, and align with evolving federal, state, and customer preferences for domestically manufactured energy infrastructure.

The MOU also outlines the parties’ intent to evaluate further strategic cooperation, including the potential development of a U.S.-based manufacturing facility, without requiring capital investment from NextNRG, as both parties reinforce their emphasis on a domestic and capital-efficient growth model focused on scale, long-term resilience, and speed to market.

“We anticipate that this collaboration will strategically position NextNRG to deploy U.S.-manufactured battery storage systems at scale while navigating an increasingly complex trade environment,” said Michael D. Farkas, Executive Chairman and CEO of NextNRG. “A123’s proven technology and domestic manufacturing capabilities align perfectly with our mission to deploy intelligent, resilient energy systems nationwide. As battery storage demand accelerates across healthcare, commercial, and utility sectors, this agreement ensures we have reliable access to premium storage solutions built in America for America.”

Under the MOU, the companies plan to collaborate on the deployment of A123’s advanced battery energy storage systems (BESS), including its 20ft- 5MWh units, across NextNRG’s expanding portfolio of U.S. energy projects. The agreement positions A123 as one of several key storage technology suppliers within NextNRG’s diversified supplier ecosystem.

“We’re very pleased and excited to begin our collaboration with NextNRG as the company continues to scale its energy storage footprint,” said Manuel Spitzlay, Senior Director of Sales at A123 Systems. “This MOU reflects a shared commitment to domestic manufacturing, reliability, and long-term growth, and we believe it creates a strong foundation for broader industry participation.”

The U.S. battery energy storage market is experiencing unprecedented growth, driven by renewable energy integration, grid modernization initiatives, and increasing demand for energy resilience across critical infrastructure sectors. Domestic manufacturing preferences, supported by federal incentives and evolving tariff policies, are reshaping supply chain strategies for energy developers nationwide.

NextNRG's collaboration with A123 is designed to address these market dynamics while positioning the company to serve its expanding pipeline of healthcare, commercial, and utility-scale energy projects.

By combining NextNRG’s project development expertise and AI-driven system integration capabilities with A123’s advanced battery manufacturing capabilities, the collaboration supports the deployment of high-performance, domestically sourced energy infrastructure across NextNRG’s national footprint.

In today’s unpredictable energy landscape, stability has become the ultimate competitive advantage. Global fuel markets remain in constant flux, influenced by geopolitical tensions, supply disruptions, and price volatility that can swing overnight. I have seen firsthand how these fluctuations can have an outsized impact on profitability and long-term planning for fleet operators.

That’s why an increasing number of transportation leaders are turning to cleaner, more reliable energy sources, namely compressed natural gas (CNG) and electric vehicles (EVs). As both technologies evolve and infrastructure expands, companies like ours are recognizing the strategic, economic, and environmental benefits of diversifying beyond traditional fossil fuels.

At ABC Companies, this shift isn’t just theoretical – it’s happening on the ground. Through new facilities, partnerships, and vehicle innovations, ABC is helping operators navigate a smarter, more sustainable future for fleet operations.

Trade policy clarity strengthens fleet stability

While tariffs and trade policy can influence long-term planning, the industry is benefiting from much-needed clarity. The administration’s recent proclamation formally recognizing motorcoaches as a distinct vehicle classification creates a more predictable environment for manufacturers and operators. It helps ensure the industry isn’t unintentionally swept into policies designed for heavy- and medium-duty trucks, and it reinforces motorcoaches’ unique role within the broader transportation ecosystem.

This recognition strengthens the foundation for future investment, innovation, and adoption of cleaner propulsion technologies without placing undue emphasis on tariffs.

CNG: A practical bridge to energy security

While EV adoption continues to accelerate, CNG remains one of the most practical alternatives available today. The U.S. benefits from a robust domestic natural gas supply, meaning fleets that convert to CNG reduce their dependence on imported oil and are less exposed to global price swings. Unlike gasoline or diesel, CNG prices are largely determined by domestic production and pipeline infrastructure, rather than global oil markets, making fuel cost projections more predictable.

We have found that CNG also delivers immediate benefits, typically reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 13-17% compared to equivalent diesel engines. With renewable natural gas entering the market, emissions reductions can become even more significant.

Our Denver facility is a direct response to this demand for reliable CNG servicing in the Mountain West, with full CNG servicing capabilities for both motorcoaches and transit vehicles.

EVs: The long game for sustainability and innovation

While electric vehicles remain an important part of the industry’s future, today’s infrastructure is still largely built for passenger EVs, not full-sized motorcoaches. That’s why many operators and even public transit agencies continue to rely on CNG for dependable, lower-emission performance.

ABC has explored EV capabilities firsthand. In 2021, the company conducted a Zero Emissions Tour, logging real-world miles to understand operational challenges and opportunities. The key takeaway: EV coaches can be effective in certain applications, but widespread adoption depends on significant expansion of heavy-duty charging infrastructure, which varies widely by market. States like California are moving faster, while others face slower grid and charging development.

For operators evaluating long-term electrification, ABC provides planning and technical support, but recognizes that, for most fleets today, CNG remains the most practical and scalable path forward.

A balanced path forward

For most fleets, the smartest approach isn’t about choosing between CNG and EV, it’s about finding the right blend for today’s needs and tomorrow’s goals. CNG offers an immediate, scalable solution that reduces fuel costs and environmental impact without overhauling operational infrastructure. EVs, on the other hand, set the foundation for long-term sustainability, future regulatory compliance, and leadership in clean transportation.

ABC Companies sits at the intersection of both. Its nationwide service network is equipped to maintain diesel, CNG, and EV systems, ensuring operators can transition at their own pace, supported by a partner that understands the realities of fleet performance, uptime, and economics.

Looking ahead

Energy independence isn’t just a national objective – it’s a business strategy. As tariffs, Section 232 trade distinctions, oil supply risks, and global energy transitions continue to reshape the market, operators who diversify their fleets now will be best positioned to weather uncertainty and capture opportunity.

With decades of experience and a clear commitment to innovation, ABC Companies is here to help operators act decisively with the right mix of technology, support, and insight to improve efficiency.

Because the future of transportation isn’t just about getting from point A to point B; it’s about how smartly, sustainably, and securely you get there.

Bottom Line For 2026 EV registration fees are expanding.","Electric cars keep getting cheaper to drive and easier to live with. Charging at home cuts fuel costs. Maintenance stays simple. Quiet cabins make daily commuting calmer. Yet a new type of bill has started appearing in mailboxes across the country. Annual EV registration surcharges, highway use fees, and road user charges are now part of ownership.

By mid-2025, 39 states had already adopted some form of special registration fee for EVs, with most charges landing between $50 and $290 per year.

More changes are scheduled for 2026. Some states are raising existing fees. Others are switching formulas. A growing group is preparing per-mile alternatives that work like a modern gas tax.

EV ownership is still expanding. State transportation budgets are still shrinking. Registration fees have become the preferred pressure valve between those two forces.

Key Points

39 states had EV registration surcharges in place by mid-2025, with annual fees commonly ranging from $50 to $290.

Many states are raising fees for 2026 and shifting toward indexed or weight-based pricing models.

Flat EV fees of $200 to $250 often exceed the federal gas tax paid by average gasoline drivers.

Per-mile road usage charges are expanding, with Oregon setting a 2.3 cents-per-mile rate for 2026.

Why States Keep Adding EV Fees

Gas taxes have funded roads for decades. Electric vehicles use those same roads yet do not buy gasoline. That design choice bypasses the fuel tax system entirely.

At the federal level, gasoline is taxed at 18.4 cents per gallon and diesel at 24.4 cents per gallon, as per the Federal Highway Administration.

That revenue supports the Highway Trust Fund, the backbone of federal transportation spending.

Two problems now collide:

EVs pay no gas tax.

Even gas vehicles generate less fuel tax than before because modern engines use less fuel per mile.

Construction costs keep rising. Fuel tax revenue keeps weakening. The Highway Trust Fund has struggled with structural shortfalls for years.

Projections show that under the current law, federal funds will fall short of obligations by FY2028.

States have chosen the fastest administrative fix. They add an annual EV fee at registration time. Because registration systems already store detailed vehicle records, tools like vingurus.com plate lookup can surface that information instantly.

Plate lookup services matter because they allow buyers, insurers, lenders, and investigators to verify a vehicle’s identity, title status, accident exposure, mileage pattern,s and possible theft or fraud risks without waiting on manual records requests.

They reduce information gaps in used-car transactions, support pricing accuracy, and lower the risk of hidden defects that lead to financial loss.

The Policy Logic States Use

Public explanations usually fall into three categories.

Replacing Missing Fuel Tax Revenue

State agencies state the logic directly. Electric vehicles use little or no gasoline. That means less contribution to the fuel tax system, which remains a primary funding source for road maintenance.

Registration fees attempt to replace part of that missing revenue.

Accounting For Vehicle Weight

Battery packs add mass. Many EVs weigh more than similar gasoline models. More weight leads to more road wear. Several states use that argument to justify tiered pricing tied to vehicle weight classes.

Using Existing Collection Systems

Per-mile tracking systems require mileage reporting, data processing, compliance checks, and enforcement. Registration fees require none of that. States already collect registration payments every year. EV surcharges simply attach to that cycle.

What “EV Registration Fee” Really Means

The phrase sounds simple. In practice, states apply EV charges in several forms:

Flat annual surcharges added to standard registration

Tiered fees based on vehicle weight or powertrain type

Indexed fees that rise automatically over time

Per-mile road usage charges that may be voluntary or mandatory

For 2026, the major trend is movement away from flat pricing and toward weight-based or indexed formulas.

Pennsylvania

Pennsylvania wrote its EV fee increases directly into law.

2025 EV fee: $200

2026 EV fee: $250

Plug-in hybrid fee in 2026: $62.50

Indexing after 2026: CPI-based annual adjustments begin in 2027

NCSL information shows that the law applies the $250 rate to registrations or renewals submitted in 2026. Starting in July 2026, PennDOT will also allow monthly payment plans for EV and plug-in hybrid owners.

Practical impact:

Pennsylvania shows the future direction clearly. Fees are not static. They rise. They index. Payment systems adjust to normalize the cost as part of routine ownership.

Minnesota

Minnesota raised its EV surcharge effective August 1, 2025. CBS News reported the following:

Previous EV surcharge: $75

New EV surcharge: $150 minimum

New plug-in hybrid surcharge: $75

Indexing mechanism: tied to gasoline excise tax indexing adjustments

Owners renewing registrations in 2026 will feel the change directly. The structure also positions Minnesota fees to rise automatically over time.

Delaware

Delaware begins collecting Alternative Fuel Vehicle fees on October 1, 2025. That makes 2026 the first full year most owners experience the new charges.

Key context from Delaware’s own data:

57,500 alternative fuel vehicles were registered when the fee program was announced.

Delaware confirmed that 39 other states already had similar fees in place.

Delaware uses tiered, weight-based pricing. For example:

Plug-in electric vehicles 6,000 pounds or less face an $85 annual fee.

Heavier vehicles pay higher fees based on weight brackets.

Delaware signals where many legislatures are headed. Flat fees are being replaced by schedules that tie price to vehicle mass and class.

A Practical Snapshot Of EV Fees Going Into 2026

The following table shows well-documented examples with active change dynamics entering 2026. Amounts reflect special EV charges only.

Where Per-Mile Charges Fit

Vehicle miles traveled systems aim to charge drivers based on distance driven rather than flat annual fees. The concept tracks road use more precisely, yet the administration burden is heavier.

Estimated administrative and enforcement costs for VMT systems fall in the 5% to 13% range of total collection. Gas taxes cost far less to administer because they are collected upstream from fuel suppliers.

Oregon’s Role

Oregon remains central to the national conversation.

Starting in 2026, OReGO members pay 2.3 cents per mile.

Policy discussions in Oregon have included flat fees around $340 or per-mile charges near 3 cents per mile as budget solutions.

Utah and Virginia also offer voluntary road usage charge programs.

Even when optional, per-mile programs shape long-term fee design and normalize mileage tracking systems.

How EV Fees Compare To Gas Taxes

Drivers often ask if EV registration fees exceed what gasoline drivers pay.

A quick federal-only comparison shows why the debate exists. According to AP News:

Average annual miles per driver: 13,476

Gas vehicle efficiency: 30 mpg

Annual gallons: 13,476 / 30 ≈ 449 gallons

Federal gas tax: 449 × $0.184 ≈ $82.62

A flat $200 to $250 EV fee exceeds that federal gas tax alone. States counter that total fuel taxes include state and local levies and that heavier vehicles cause more road wear.

EVs and plug-in hybrids still represented only 1.7% of the total U.S. vehicle fleet in 2023, which limits how much revenue EV-only fees can raise in the near term.

Transportation funding gaps remain far larger. Projections show an average $41 billion annual Highway Trust Fund deficit for FY2026 to FY2035.

What “More States Are Planning To Add Charges” Means For 2026

The next phase is not about introducing EV fees from scratch. The next phase focuses on refinement.

Fee Schedules Become More Technical

Weight-based tiers, vehicle class categories, and powertrain distinctions are becoming standard legislative language. Delaware already models that approach.

Indexing Becomes The Default

Pennsylvania and Minnesota now rely on automatic adjustment mechanisms. Indexing reduces repeated legislative battles and steadily increases long-term costs to owners.

Payment Systems Are Being Normalized

Monthly payment options and streamlined collection systems make EV fees feel routine rather than exceptional. Pennsylvania’s 2026 monthly payment rollout illustrates that shift.

Per-Mile Charges Move Closer To Mandates

Oregon and Hawaii discussions show that per-mile models are no longer theoretical. They now tie directly into state budget planning.

How To Estimate Your 2026 EV Fee In Minutes

Use a short checklist.

Identify vehicle category: Battery electric, plug-in hybrid, or hybrid. Many states price them differently.

Confirm registration cycle: Annual or biennial terms change how fees are calculated.

Check vehicle weight: Weight-based tiers can raise or lower costs significantly.

Review scheduled increases: Look for increases that activate in 2026.

Check for per-mile options: Some programs allow mileage charges instead of flat fees.

The Debates That Will Shape Future Laws

Fair Share Versus Overcharge

Supporters argue EV drivers should contribute to road funding. Critics point out that flat fees can exceed fuel taxes paid by many gasoline drivers.

Flat Fees Versus Mileage Tracking

Flat fees are easy to administer. Mileage systems align cost with use yet raise privacy, enforcement, and administrative cost concerns.

State Fees Versus Federal Action

A 2025 federal proposal suggested national registration fees of $250 for EVs and $100 for hybrids, administered by states. The proposal did not pass.

Federal involvement would immediately change double-payment questions across states.

Bottom Line For 2026

EV registration fees are expanding. Scheduled increases, indexed formulas, weight-based tiers, and per-mile pilots define the next stage of policy.

Use your state’s DMV publications and statutory trackers to verify current amounts. Fees can change mid-year and can apply differently by registration cycle, vehicle class, and weight category.

For many owners, 2026 will feel less like a new rule and more like a normalization of annual EV charges as part of routine vehicle ownership.",https://freedomforallamericans.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Electric-vehicle-taxes-by-state.jpg,N,,2025-12-29 11:00:45.529782

“People in small towns and rural areas pay much bigger energy bills.
Together, the coalition set the goal of slashing energy bills for more than 17,000 families in the region through solar projects capable of generating over 100 megawatts of electrical power.
Should the Trump administration refuse to release the Solar for All money promised to Groundswell, Moore says her organization will explore other options to get the solar projects off the ground.
“People are struggling with high (energy) bills that are getting higher.","Clemetine Howard has spent the past year dreaming of bringing affordable solar energy to the Mississippi Delta.

Howard is executive director of the Clarence and Mary Lee Howard Foundation in Yazoo City, Mississippi—one of many locations previously set to benefit from a $7 billion federal program aimed at making solar power accessible to low-income households. The “Solar for All” program promised to lower energy bills and create jobs in places like the Delta, and Howard’s foundation had spent months setting up training and development courses to help local residents join the solar workforce.

Those efforts were suspended in August when the Environmental Protection Agency canceled the program, halting billions of dollars in solar funding bound for communities across the country. The termination is part of the Trump administration’s broader campaign to claw back clean energy investments and climate spending authorized under the previous administration.

Losing the Solar for All program was a gut punch for Howard, who saw it as a catalyst for improving conditions in Yazoo City and changing the career trajectory of some of its residents.

“It was truly devastating,” Howard told the Mississippi Free Press on Sept. 24. “We saw this as a way to make a life-changing difference to folks in the Mississippi Delta.”

The Solar for All program is part of the $27 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund established under former President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act. Launched in 2023, the program awarded grants to 60 applicants working to expand access to solar power—a renewable energy increasingly seen as a cleaner, more cost-effective alternative to fossil fuels. Grant recipients ranged from state and municipal governments to tribes and nonprofits, and projects included solar panel leasing programs for homeowners and community solar initiatives for renters and multifamily properties.

The federal funds were meant to offset the initial cost of installing solar panel systems and related community projects, which typically carry price tags of tens of thousands of dollars. In 2025, a homeowner can expect to pay around $14,210 for a small residential solar panel system before factoring in financial incentives, one Consumer Affairs report found.

When fully executed, Solar for All was poised to deliver solar power to 900,000 households nationwide, many of them in rural and underserved areas, according to estimates from the Biden administration. Those homes were expected to save a collective $350 million in utility costs annually, with some families pocketing more than $1,000 each year.

“With the way this program was structured, the savings were massive,” said Emily Samsel, a spokesperson at Climate Power, a strategic communications organization focused on climate change. “President Trump said in his (2024) campaign that he would cut energy bills in half by the end of his first year in office, and we’ve already seen bills are up 10% nationwide. He’s actively raising energy costs by taking away programs like Solar for All.”

In a statement to the Mississippi Free Press, the EPA said it lacks the authority and funds to administer Solar for All following the passage of President Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” in July. The legislation revoked the appropriated money in Biden’s Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund—a move that many groups and lawmakers have blasted as illegal.

“​​The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed into law on July 4, 2025, rescinds both the authority and the appropriated funds to run the Solar for All program. EPA is working diligently to implement the law in accordance with congressional intent,” EPA Press Secretary Brigit Hirsch wrote in a Sept. 29 email.

Solar for All’s dissolution has drawn multiple legal challenges. On Oct. 16, more than a dozen state attorneys general sued the EPA over the canceled solar funds, asking a federal judge to direct the agency to reinstate the program. The lawsuit follows earlier litigation from a collection of labor groups and other nonprofits seeking to reverse the program’s termination.

Lawsuits challenging the elimination of separate Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund investments are still ongoing, though an appeals court ruled last month that federal officials can move forward with the cancellations.

Fighting for Energy Affordability

Among the 60 Solar for All grantees set to receive funding before the August termination was Groundswell, an organization dedicated to increasing energy resilience and efficiency across multiple regions. The nonprofit secured a five-year, $156 million contract from the EPA to build community solar projects across eight southern states, with more than $8 million earmarked for Mississippi ventures.

Though much of the discourse around Solar for All has centered on clean energy investments, Groundswell CEO Michelle Moore stressed that the program’s core objective was affordability.

“The primary goal of the program, and actually the statutory goal of the program, was to cut electricity bills,” she told the Mississippi Free Press in a Sept. 24 interview. “People in small towns and rural areas pay much bigger energy bills. It’s not because the electricity is any more expensive—it’s just that the housing is in such bad shape.”

To execute its contract with EPA, Groundswell has spent the past two years building a coalition of municipal utility providers and community organizations throughout the Southeast, including Clemetine Howard’s charitable foundation in Yazoo City. Together, the coalition set the goal of slashing energy bills for more than 17,000 families in the region through solar projects capable of generating over 100 megawatts of electrical power.

The same week that the EPA announced the termination of Solar for All, Groundswell received a bid for a solar and energy storage project in Yazoo City that would have helped 185 families save $1,170 annually on electricity, according to company estimates. The initiative was the first of several planned projects in Mississippi, which Groundswell projected would benefit over 1,200 households and deliver aggregate cost savings of nearly $30 million over 20 years.

The projects would also create solar and utility jobs that Moore and Howard stressed could help lift some residents out of poverty.

“You’re talking about individuals who would go from living in small quarters … to owning a home and building wealth,” Howard explained, noting that many solar installation jobs have annual salaries of around $60,000. “So you’re talking about economic development in a real sense.”

Charting A Path Forward

Moore isn’t willing to give up the Solar for All funding awarded to Groundswell without a fight. In late August, her organization filed a formal Notice of Disagreement with the EPA over the grant’s cancellation—the first step in an administrative dispute process that Moore hopes could spark renewed negotiations with the agency. This dispute process is separate from litigation challenging the EPA’s decision to withhold funds appropriated by Congress, Moore added.

“The ball is in EPA’s court,” she said, noting that she expects a response to her filing no later than February. “We would still welcome the opportunity to sit down with EPA officials (to talk) about a path forward, as well as continuing to pursue the administrative process.”

Groundswell is not the only Solar for All grantee with planned projects in Mississippi. The EPA also selected Hope Enterprise Corporation, a Jackson-based credit union and financial services institution, to receive more than $62 million in federal funds for a rooftop solar leasing program and various community solar initiatives, according to the company website.

The Mississippi Free Press reached out to Hope Enterprise Corporation several times to inquire about the grant and its cancellation, but did not hear back by press time.

Should the Trump administration refuse to release the Solar for All money promised to Groundswell, Moore says her organization will explore other options to get the solar projects off the ground.

“People are struggling with high (energy) bills that are getting higher. And not only that, our region is short on power,” she said. “So whether the federal government stands behind its contract or not, the facts don’t change, and neither does our commitment.”

The Clean Air Act of 1970 was the first law to require the EPA to set uniform nationwide standards for air quality.
I could go on with photos and stories about laws from the 1970s that changed how Americans treat our lands and waters.","Growing up in the 1970s, I took for granted the trash piles along the highway, tires washed up on beaches and smog fouling city air.

Such scenes are why the first Earth Day — on April 22, 1970 — energized the nation. In the largest single-day public demonstration in U.S. history, roughly 10% of the population took to the streets to shout together: “Enough is enough!”

Republican and Democratic politicians alike listened. Over the decade that followed, all the nation’s foundational environmental laws were passed with strong bipartisan support, including the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act and Endangered Species Act.

These laws are taking a beating at the moment, including from the Environmental Protection Agency — the federal agency created in 1970 to protect the environment. The agency’s leader, Lee Zeldin, boasted of “driving a dagger straight into the heart” of environmental regulations. President Trump regularly derides environmental laws as job killers and government overreach.

The conditions that made these laws necessary have largely been forgotten, allowing critics to focus entirely on costs while ignoring the laws’ very real benefits and achievements.

That’s why I was excited to learn recently about the Documerica project: 20,000 photos taken from 1972 through 1978 that show in clear visual evidence how dirty the U.S. used to be. Looking back at it now should wake people up to how much better the environment is today.

Environmental protection was a bipartisan effort in the 1970s: The EPA was created by President Nixon, a Republican. The agency’s first leader was William Ruckelshaus, a Republican congressman from Indiana.

Inspired by the famous photographs of Depression-era farmworkers commissioned in the 1930s by the Farm Security Administration, Ruckelshaus’ EPA commissioned a nationwide photo record. The goal was to create a “visual baseline” that would demonstrate the agency’s future progress.

To say America’s landscape was littered in the 1970s is not merely poetic phrasing. Waste disposal was a matter of local law, and illegal dumping was commonplace. Drums of pesticides and chemicals could be sent to the local dump along with tires and just about anything else people and companies wanted to get rid of. When the dump was full, it was covered with topsoil and became open land, ready for recreation or building construction.

One place where this happened was Love Canal, a neighborhood near Niagara Falls, N.Y. A dump holding decades of chemical drums from the Hooker Chemical Co. was lightly covered and sold to the town for $1. A neighborhood was built on the land.

Only when people noticed high levels of miscarriages and cancer clusters among the residents — and saw waste oozing in through basement walls — did opinion change.

In 1976, Congress passed the Resource Conservation Recovery Act to track waste materials from their creation to their disposal and set tough standards for how to dispose of them. But by then, decades of unregulated waste disposal had contaminated sites all over the country. The contaminants, toxicity and people responsible were often unknown.

Four years later, the 1980 law known as “Superfund” set standards and assigned financial responsibility for cleaning up hazardous waste sites. The law created a multibillion-dollar fund that could pay for the cleanups and required potentially responsible parties to reimburse the government or clean up the sites on their own.

Suddenly, companies paid much more careful attention to their waste disposal.

Just as with dumps on land, all kinds of waste used to be disposed of in rivers, lakes and harbors. There was a federal law in place, but it was ineffective and relied on states to set limits and enforce them.

I had the misfortune in 1978 to capsize while sailing on the Charles River in Boston. My shame turned to a dermatologist’s visit when I broke out in rashes the next day. You fell in the Charles at your peril.

Environmental advocates weren’t kidding when, in the 1960s and 1970s, they declared “Lake Erie is a dead lake” because of all the industrial pollution pouring into its waters. An oil slick on Cleveland’s Cuyahoga River famously caught fire in 1969 — actually the 12th time the river had burned in a century.

The Clean Water Act of 1972 sought to create a national standard, requiring companies that wanted to discharge waste into waterways to get a federal permit and use the best available technology to reduce the amount and toxicity of what they did dump. The act also provided billions of taxpayer dollars to upgrade sewage treatment plants, so they didn’t just dump untreated sewage into the water.

The ambitious goal was to end water pollution entirely and make all of the nation’s waters safe for swimming and fishing within a decade. Those aspirational goals for the country’s waters still have not been fully met, though Ruckelshaus used to quip that at least they are not flammable. And by now, the Charles River and other urban waterways that people avoided in the 1970s boast all manner of recreation, with little or no risk of rashes even while swimming.

Perhaps the most obvious improvement since the 1970s has been in air quality around the U.S.

The horrible smog around Los Angeles is well known. But many other cities were blanketed in polluted air that led to respiratory illnesses and millions of early deaths across the nation over the decades. In Pittsburgh it was only half-jokingly said that you had to floss your teeth after breathing.

The Clean Air Act of 1970 was the first law to require the EPA to set uniform nationwide standards for air quality. In short order, lead was phased out of gasoline, catalytic converters were required on cars, acid rain was ended and the sources of smog were stringently regulated. An EPA study found that the benefits under the law exceeded costs by a factor of more than 30 to 1 and, in 2020 alone, prevented more than 230,000 early deaths.

I could go on with photos and stories about laws from the 1970s that changed how Americans treat our lands and waters. But it all boils down to two simple facts. First, with the exception of greenhouse gases, which have been in effect unregulated, every major measure of environmental health has improved significantly over the last five decades.

Now, city officials are looking to evolve their city’s business footprint toward greener power. They’re not alone.

Opened in 1902, the refinery has led some to make concerted efforts to distance the city of more than 100,000 people from the fossil fuel industry, most recently through a short-lived ballot measure supported by activists who said funds would be needed to help envision a Richmond without a refinery.

A $550 million settlement between Richmond and the refinery, paid over a 10-year period, resulted in the measure being pulled from the November 2024 ballot.

Aside from charging one of the city’s largest taxpayers, some have also looked toward attracting clean energy businesses. The off-shore wind industry has risen as a potential option, with the city being awarded a $750,000 grant from the California Energy Commission in December to help with drafting an Offshore Wind Conceptual Planning Project.

“This planning effort represents a critical first step toward positioning the Port of Richmond as a potential host for future offshore-wind activities — an industry expected to generate thousands of high-quality jobs and substantial economic benefits,” read a staff report detailing the project.

Like Richmond, ports in Humboldt, Oakland, Benicia, Stockton, San Francisco and Redwood City, as well as private terminals in Antioch and Pittsburg, have also been identified in a study by the federal Bureau of Ocean Energy Management as potential offshore wind manufacturing and fabrication sites.

Companies like Viridi Parente, a bicoastal battery energy storage system manufacturer that opened in Richmond this past summer, have also been welcomed with open arms. With the support of a $9.3 million California Energy Commission grant, Viridi operates out of a 40,000-square-foot facility formerly home to its competitor Moxion Power, which laid off hundreds of employees and filed for bankruptcy in 2024.

Viridi offers battery energy storage system products that can either be installed in existing occupied facilities like industrial, medical, commercial, or municipal buildings, or trailered into temporary worksites or events.

Motivated by concerns for rising energy costs, stressed power grids and climate change, dozens of elected officials from across the country gathered in early December to tour the Richmond facility and learn more about what the technology can do.

“This is where the rubber meets the road. We’re the ones that have to manifest it,” said San Rafael Mayor Kate Colin, speaking to the pressure on city officials to implement state legislation, including renewable energy policies.

The road toward greener pastures is still unclear for Richmond and the greater region.

Viridi officials say the company plans to continue its expansion in Richmond, which will mean increasing staffing to meet growing demand for products.

Glydways, a company building small, electric, autonomous public transportation vehicles, is transforming an underutilized parking lot in Richmond into a testing ground. And renewable fuel company Raven SR plans to develop a plant in the city where organic waste will be converted into hydrogen fuel.

At the city government level, Colin and Esther Morales, director of innovation in Oakland Mayor Barbara Lee’s office, both said their respective cities are trying to understand how they can pursue renewable energy solutions while responsibly managing their budgets.

Meanwhile, the battle over state and federal government supported renewable energy projects continues with California officials and agencies supporting offshore wind initiatives while the Trump administration has taken steps to block wind energy projects through executive order and canceled grants worth $679 million, according to multiple news reports. Notably, those measures have been met by resistance and lost court battles.

For Richmond Mayor Eduardo Martinez, a world in which green businesses replace oil refineries is one to pursue. Martinez was a keynote speaker at the Dec. 3 Viridi event alongside Hawaii State Sen. Chris Lee and Viridi CEO Jon Williams.

“Chevron has shaped our economy and our neighborhoods for generations,” Martinez said. “Richmond is looking towards the future, where our economy is not dependent on a single fossil fuel employer. We are growing sectors that create cleaner hair, good jobs, and long term stability.”",https://www.siliconvalley.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/EBT-L-BESS-XX-5.jpg?w=1024&h=683,N,,2025-12-29 10:00:41.530888

They’re preparing to push hard for bills that will advance solar energy and batteries amid Trump administration attacks that will end key subsidies for renewables in 2026.
“Climate is going to make a comeback this year in Maryland,” said Brittany Baker, Maryland director at the Chesapeake Climate Action Network.
“We have options that include renewables and natural gas,” Ferguson said.
“The way I feel, I think natural gas ought to be a part of this.” It’s clear, said Del.","In many ways, Maryland climate advocates felt “blindsided” by the 2025 legislative session, says Kim Coble, leader of the state chapter of the League of Conservation Voters.

Spurred by calls and emails from constituents complaining of high power bills, legislative leaders determined that increasing in-state energy generation was the solution, passing proposals to bolster solar panels and battery storage technology. But they also opened the door for expedited permitting of a new natural gas-fired power plant in Maryland — even though it would likely place the state’s ambitious climate commitments out of reach.

And in October — in response to the legislature’s new energy law — Constellation Energy proposed just that.

“When we would say: ‘How does this match with our climate goals?’” Coble said, “the response you’d get back is: ‘We have to generate more energy.’”

With the 2026 session approaching, climate groups say they are ready for round two. They’re preparing to push hard for bills that will advance solar energy and batteries amid Trump administration attacks that will end key subsidies for renewables in 2026.

And they’re better prepared to play defense, opposing new natural gas generation, and any efforts to mine environmental and energy funds to close another intimidating budget shortfall.

“Climate is going to make a comeback this year in Maryland,” said Brittany Baker, Maryland director at the Chesapeake Climate Action Network.

Climate promises a ‘heavy lift’

Judge denies US Wind request to halt Trump administration attacks

But at least one leading lawmaker, Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) said during a December interview that new natural gas remains on the table.

“We have options that include renewables and natural gas,” Ferguson said. “I think we have to have a really challenging conversation this session about the balance between the aggressiveness of our climate policies and the affordability for everyday Marylanders — and there’s a balance in between.”

Current law requires the state, in just five years, to have reduced its greenhouse gas emissions 60% from 2006 levels. And nine years from now, Gov. Wes Moore (D) has pledged that the state will use 100% clean energy.

State studies have shown that the two goals are going to be a challenge. A January 2025 report from the Maryland Energy Administration labeled Moore’s clean energy goal “incredibly difficult.” One potential roadmap included a massive 185% increase in nuclear power, along with big increases in solar, onshore and offshore wind.

Paul Pinsky, recently retired director of the Energy Administration, and the architect of the state’s climate mandates, said that both goals will be “a heavy lift.”

“There’s been some retreat, and that’s a problem,” Pinsky said. “We’ve got five years, and we have a fairly significant way to go. So I’m not sure: Are we going to put our shoulders on the grindstone and push forward, or will the government backtrack?”

Part of the problem, Pinsky said, is that no legislators back then expected power demand to rise so precipitously — largely because no one predicted the role of data centers and artificial intelligence.

“We didn’t think or talk about data centers,” said Pinsky, who represented Prince George’s County in the General Assembly for decades before taking over the Energy Administration. “It was not on our radar screen.”

If Pinsky knew then what he knows now, the Climate Solutions Now Act might have looked a bit different, he said.

“I would have said that any data center coming into the state has to bring additional energy, at a minimum — and maybe requiring clean energy,” Pinsky said.

Preventing a solar energy ‘valley of death’

Climate advocates plan to take advantage of the moment to promote renewables in Maryland, especially solar and storage, as Maryland’s offshore wind projects face an unabating assault from the White House.

“Our message to the General Assembly is: You wanted to see what all of the proposals would look like. Now you’re looking at them,” said Josh Tulkin, executive director of the Maryland chapter of the Sierra Club. “And we think that there’s a strong case that the clean energy and energy efficiency and battery storage options are providing the opportunities that Maryland needs.”

Perhaps aiding advocates’ argument is the fact that Constellation CEO Joe Dominguez has admitted the company’s proposal for a new gas plant in Harford County would be expensive — and likely require state assistance. Getting gas to the site could cost north of $800 million, he told a gathering of legislators in November. The company also offered a battery storage proposal for the expedited consideration before the Public Service Commission.

“We need to kind of make some decisions. We could be a state that has its own natural gas-fired generation, or we can continue to be a state that builds transmission lines in from Pennsylvania,” Dominguez said in November. “The way I feel, I think natural gas ought to be a part of this.”

It’s clear, said Del. Lorig Charkoudian (D-Montgomery), that gas couldn’t be built in Maryland “without some kind of state support.” But that money is better spent elsewhere, she said.

“Let’s figure out what additional supports are needed, and let’s use that to double down on renewables that are also good for our air, our land, our water and our climate,” she said.

Constellation targets Harford County for new gas plant, but pipeline costs could get in the way

Charkoudian said she is working on a bill that would direct funds that Maryland already collects from energy suppliers (and, by extension, ratepayers) and direct it to the winning bidders in a competitive procurement for new solar energy projects.

Currently, those funds — a specific type of “alternative compliance payments” — go into the Strategic Energy Investment Fund, which energy suppliers pay into when they do not meet the state’s renewable energy requirements. There, the funds can be deployed for a variety of uses, including solar projects but also energy efficiency upgrades for low-income households, EV chargers and more.

“Now, we’re taking that money and building solar with it,” Charkoudian said.

Evan Vaughan, executive director of MAREC Action, formerly the Mid-Atlantic Renewable Energy Coalition, said his members, which include solar developers and panel manufacturers, support the delegate’s proposal.

“These projects can come online faster than just about anything else,” he said. “But this is partially to prevent there from being a valley of death for the solar industry with the federal tax incentives going away.”

Del. David Fraser-Hidalgo (D-Montgomery) said he is focusing on minimizing “soft costs” for solar developers, particularly given that federal tax credits are set to lapse next summer, after President Donald Trump (R) signed the “One Big Beautiful Bill” into law.

“Every project just went up 30%, with the loss of that federal tax credit, which is concerning,” Fraser-Hidalgo said. “We don’t want to lose the solar industry in Maryland.”",https://cdn.newsfromthestates.com/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-101/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/iil-bw-xx-cb-ian-aj-0013_0-1-1024x6321767014703.jpg?h=3f82fd9e&itok=ZrFbNWpt,N,,2025-12-29 10:13:49.825930

“EPA released their volumes for 2026 and 2027 this year. So, ACE and others have been participating in that rulemaking process, and one of the things is that there’s a Small Refinery Exemption Program with the RFS, and the EPA this year proposed to reallocate gallons that they’ve been waiving for the small refinery exemption. So, we need those gallons reallocated, so demand destruction doesn’t happen, and we keep those renewable volumes whole. And so, we’re still waiting for the EPA here to finalize that rulemaking and give our farmers and biofuel producers some clarity here, and then they need to reallocate those gallons and follow through on what they propose by 100 percent reallocation.”

Katie Muckenhirn, vice president of public affairs for the American Coalition for Ethanol, says requiring fuel processors to blend in biofuels has always been a point of contention.

“That’s been a struggle throughout the years, and what the EPA has said, and what we know to be true, is that refineries can recover the costs of biofuel through the RINs. And so, yeah, there’s a cost to comply, but then they recover those costs through a RIN value, so the struggle is the play over market share.”

ACE is also pushing Congress to pass the Nationwide Consumer and Fuel Retailer Choice Act to secure year-round E15 access across all states, which is vital for utilizing the nation’s record corn crop.

“Absolutely, those eight Midwest states do have E15 year-round, but we need it nationwide, and there is bipartisan, bicameral legislation in Congress, the Nationwide Consumer and Fuel Retailer Choice Act, led by Nebraska Senator Deb Fisher. And we need that legislation to be passed to ensure that all states can sell E15 nationwide without waiting on those summer waivers that we’ve had to do for the last four summers. So, you know, the time is ripe for that, even more than ever now, with farmers having a record corn crop coming in. We need outlets. We need markets.”

Persistence and ingenuity over the decades across the world made the potential realization of solar energy a reality.","In 1839, a magical phenomenon was observed. ‘The Photovoltaic effect’ was discovered by a French physicist, Alexandre Edmond Becquerel. Being the first instance of light being converted to energy, it opened the doors to the field of solar power. Becquerel’s fascinating discovery has undergone a profound evolution from the singular curiosity of a scientist to the principle of an advanced solar industry. In 2025, the evolution of the industry has undergone a crazy transformation- to a singular millimeter.

Sphelar cells are pioneers in the world of solar technology and may reach mainstream tech status soon

Sphelar Power, a pioneer of solar technology, has, for the first time, designed spherical solar cells with a diameter of one millimeter. These, the Sphelar cells, are a game changer in the world of solar technology.

Unlike the conventional solar panel, which has a flat and rigid design, Sphelar cells are able to capture solar energy from any direction. As a result, they are able to provide energy from sun rays at any position in the solar cycle, which is something conventional solar panels are unable to dream of.

How do Sphelar cells work?

Why are Sphelar cells low-maintenance? They’re happy in shaded areas, urban landscapes, or even areas where sunlight is weak or indirect.

Their compact size opens new possibilities for integration into everyday objects.

Portable solar cells can be used to power windows, building facades, wearables, electric vehicles, and even solar-powered batteries.

Becquerel’s discovery: A testament to the evolution of solar technology

Becquerel’s discovery and Sphelar’s solar tech innovations are a true testament to how far solar technologies have come. At first, photovoltaic cells were costly, electrically inefficient, and capable of generating only a small fraction of a watt of power.

It was only after many years that advancements in the composition of semiconductors and the efficiencies in their construction resulted in the manufacture of solar cells and panels at the lowest prices in the market, yielding a highly efficient renewable energy source.

The renewable energy market would see solar power as one of the most rapidly advancing energy generation technologies and as one of the fastest growing of any energy source.

Even with the improvements, there would still be the inability to capture light energy in non-ideal conditions, aesthetic and spatial limitations, and poor versatility of designs.

Do you believe that one unique downsizing idea could change contemporary living?

Solar Power focused on innovative solar energized solutions and mitigating challenges. In this vein, the design of the cells was downscaled to millimeters in size. They were also integrated sedimentarily in microspherical structured eco cell clusters. These offer a seamless integumentary energy collection design, which is advantageous in that it’s suitable for all surfaces in contemporary living.

Microcells have the versatility to be mounted in clusters where large power generation is needed or scattered for borderless decentralized energy capture. Microorganisms have great adaptability, making them able to serve new, harsher environments, expanding the use of solar energy to new and borderless environments.

Sustainability and innovation

Sustainability goes hand in hand with innovation and advancement in technology. Sphelar cells assist in mobile solar energy harvesting in metropolitan areas. The technology assists in the harvesting of solar energy in congested urban areas. The cells also preserve the environmental footprint and allow conversion of solar energy with the deployed technology.

Persistence and ingenuity over the decades across the world made the potential realization of solar energy a reality.

Greg Abbott touted the state’s energy sector boom during recent public remarks and bill signings, highlighting major nuclear investments and oil theft crackdowns.

The governor positioned Texas as headquarters of America’s “nuclear renaissance” with $350 million in state funding. The announcements underscore Texas’ push to dominate both traditional and advanced energy markets. With growing power demands from data centers and manufacturers, the state is betting big on diversified energy production.

State officials have cited rapid population growth, industrial expansion, and data center demand as key drivers of rising electricity needs.

“This year Texas took a magnificent step in becoming the headquarters of the American Nuclear Renaissance,” Abbott said. “Texas is investing in the future of the world’s energy sector and protecting the petroleum industry, the lifeblood of the state’s economy, to power our state for generations to come.”

Abbott signed four bills in June targeting oil theft in West Texas and promoting growth in the area. The legislation creates specialized law enforcement units and task forces to combat organized petroleum theft operations.

Senate Bill 494 establishes a petroleum product theft task force. House Bill 48 creates an organized oilfield theft prevention unit within the Department of Public Safety, while Senate Bill 1806 gives the DPS additional tools to combat oil and gas theft. SB 529 alters the tax code affecting the city of Midland, redirecting certain revenues toward local economic development initiatives.

“We are bringing the full weight of the law to crack down on oil theft in the Permian Basin to protect the critical role energy development plays in fueling our economy,” Abbott said at the June signing.

The nuclear push centers on House Bill 14, passed in June. The law creates the Texas Advanced Nuclear Energy Office and allocates $350 million in state funding for nuclear development, the largest such commitment by any U.S. state.

“Texas is the energy capital of the world, and this legislation will position Texas at the forefront of America’s nuclear renaissance,” Abbott said. The office aims to accelerate next-generation reactor deployment while rebuilding domestic nuclear supply chains.

Abbott appointed Jarred Shaffer as the nuclear office’s first director in September. The agency immediately began soliciting public input on strategic planning and regulatory improvements.

Traditional energy projects also secured major funding through the Texas Energy Fund. The state announced over $2.4 billion in grants and loans for five natural gas plants.

The largest award went to Competitive Power Ventures Basin Ranch — $1.12 billion for a 1,350-megawatt facility in Ward County. NRG Energy received two awards totaling $732 million for plants in Houston and Baytown.

“As the Texas economy continues to grow, the lifeblood of every business increasingly depends upon affordable, reliable power,” Abbott said at October’s Texas Nuclear Summit. “To power our future, Texas must be the epicenter for nuclear power generation.”

New poll shows most US voters support Paris Agreement,Liam Gilliver,,,,,https://www.euronews.com/green/2025/12/29/will-trumps-climate-criticism-backfire-new-poll-shows-most-us-voters-support-paris-agreeme,"Most registered voters in the US lean favourably towards green energy investment and climate commitments, despite Donald Trump’s blistering attacks.
This was spearheaded by liberal Democrats (95 per cent) and a large majority of moderate/conservative Democrats (82 per cent).
This includes 96 per cent of liberal Democrats, 86 per cent of moderate/conservative Democrats, 57 per cent of liberal/moderate Republicans, and 26 per cent of conservative Republicans.
However, the poll found that 77 per cent of registered voters support US participation in the Paris Climate Agreement, with 64 per cent opposing Trump’s decision to pull out of the commitment.
*The poll consists of 47 per cent Democrats, 42 per cent Republicans, 9 per cent Independents, and 3 per cent of registered voters who didn’t select any political party but are still registered to vote.","Most registered voters in the US lean favourably towards green energy investment and climate commitments, despite Donald Trump’s blistering attacks.

The POTUS has consistently worked to boost polluting fuels that fry the planet, describing wind and solar power as “the scam of the century” and vowing not to approve any new projects.

He previously argued the concept of global warming was “created by and for the Chinese” to make US manufacturing non-competitive, and referred to wind energy as a “con job” during his trip to Scotland - urging Europe to “stop the windmills”.

Earlier this month, theUS Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) also removed all mention of fossil fuels – the main driver of global warming – from its popular online page explaining the causes of climate change. Now it only mentions natural phenomena, even though scientists calculate that the majority of the warming is due to human activity.

Despite the series of rollbacks, a new poll by the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication shows that the climate crisis is still a key consideration for US voters.

Where do US voters stand on global warming?

The nationally representative survey, which consists of 990 registered voters, found that 59 per cent would prefer to vote for a candidate for public office who supports action on global warming.

This was spearheaded by liberal Democrats (95 per cent) and a large majority of moderate/conservative Democrats (82 per cent). However, 42 per cent of liberal/moderate Republicans also said they would prefer a candidate supporting climate action - as well as 21 per cent of conservative Republicans.

41 per cent of surveyed voters said they would like to hear from political candidates about efforts to reduce global warming more often, while 35 per cent said global warming will be a “very important” issue to them in deciding who they will vote for in the 2026 congressional election.

Most US voters support green energy

More than 60 per cent of registered voters also think developing sources of clean energy should be a “high or very high priority” for the President and Congress.

In fact, the majority of participants supported a range of policies to reduce carbon pollution, such as restoring soil healthand bolstering green energy.

Even Republicans supported funding more research into renewable energy sources – with 73 per cent of liberal-moderate Republicans and 47 per cent of conservative Republicans backing the drive.

Despite Trump often criticising the appearance of solar and wind farms, 66 per cent of registered voters support transitioning the US economy from fossil fuels to 100 per cent clean energy by 2050.

This includes 96 per cent of liberal Democrats, 86 per cent of moderate/conservative Democrats, 57 per cent of liberal/moderate Republicans, and 26 per cent of conservative Republicans.

Should Donald Trump have left the Paris Agreement?

In 2015, almost 200 nations, including the US, signed a legally-binding treaty to hold the “increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C above preindustrial levels” and pursue efforts to “limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above preindustrial levels”.

Dubbed The Paris Agreement, the treaty is often seen as one of the biggest environmental commitments in history. However, just two years later, Trump initiated the process to withdraw from the treaty.

For the first time in 30 years, the US had no official representation at this year’s UN COP talks.

However, the poll found that 77 per cent of registered voters support US participation in the Paris Climate Agreement, with 64 per cent opposing Trump’s decision to pull out of the commitment.

While the majority of Republicans still support Trump’s controversial withdrawal, 35 per cent say they “somewhat” or “strongly” oppose the decision.

Why climate change is important to US voters

The survey shows there is still substantial support for climate-damaging activities such as drilling and mining fossil fuels on public land in the US (45 per cent) and drilling for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (33 per cent).

However, a much larger proportion of the voter base is aware of the potential benefits of green energy. Almost half (49 per cent) think that renewables could improve economic growth and provide new jobs, while 65 per cent think global warming is affecting the cost of livingin the US.

You are a law professor, right?

Yes.

Do you remember you were my law professor at UChicago?

I do not remember that. I apologize.

The professor can certainly be forgiven given the vast number of students he taught corporate law, including this unmemorable author. The topic of discussion was the corporate veil-piercing doctrine, which is notoriously unpredictable and the source of much disagreement in the legal community.

Our client was a landlord who sued a co-working space tenant for failure to pay rent. And the case was also brought against the tenant’s parent company under an alter-ego theory — that is, alleging the parent company (that did not sign the lease) should be liable for the debt of the defunct subsidiary tenant (that did sign) such that the corporate veil should be pierced.

Corporate veil-piercing doctrine

The law treats entities as separate and distinct from their shareholders, related entities and affiliates. Generally, the debt or obligations of an entity cannot be imputed to others. This separation, commonly referred to as the “corporate veil,” allows entities to internalize both the benefits and burdens of corporate actions, such as signing contracts, suing (and being sued) and complying with the law. The protections offered by the corporate veil (very rightly) encourage and cordon off risk. That is, the only skin in the game is the entity’s assets.

Due to its vital role in corporate America, the corporate veil is very difficult to pierce. Though standards vary across jurisdictions, a party seeking to pierce the corporate veil must generally show that “the owners, through their domination [of the corporate entity], abused the privilege of doing business in the corporate form to perpetrate a wrong or injustice against the plaintiff such that a court in equity will intervene.” Plaintiffs often try to meet this standard by demonstrating that:

The owners or shareholders controlled the entity to such an extent that the corporation had no independent existence, and they were merely alter egos of the corporation.

The corporate form was used fraudulently or for an improper purpose.

Such improper or fraudulent use of the corporation caused harm to the plaintiff.

The corporate entity must be disregarded to prevent an injustice.

If this standard is met, assets other than the entity’s (such as personal assets) can satisfy a judgment. It is thus critically important to follow corporate formalities and not abuse the corporate form.

Case study: Stockbridge v. Industrious

In Stockbridge 600 West Jackson, LLC v. Industrious National Management Co. LLC, the Illinois appellate court held that corporate veil-piercing was appropriate.

In 2018, Industrious National Management Company, a co-working space provider (like WeWork), approached Stockbridge 600 West Jackson about renting space in a Chicago office building. After Industrious National produced documents and articles touting its financial strength, Stockbridge agreed to a lease, which Industrious National’s single-member subsidiary LLC executed.

In 2020, shortly after the Covid-19 virus first surfaced, Industrious Jackson defaulted on the lease. As was later discovered in the underlying litigation, Industrious National had already decided to end its lease due to underperformance and used Covid-19 as its partial cover story. Industrious National told Stockbridge it would exit the location and not pay future rent, despite years of future rent obligations. Unbeknown to Stockbridge, Industrious National planned to move its co-working members to its other co-working spaces miles away. In its efforts to quietly move its members to the new location, Industrious National went so far as to instruct movers to “wear plain clothing” and “be discreet” in executing their plan.

In late 2020, after resolution attempts failed, Stockbridge sued Industrious Jackson (the tenant that signed the lease) and Industrious National (the parent company) for breach of the lease and fraudulent transfer of assets. Among other claims, the complaint alleged that Industrious Jackson failed to observe corporate formalities and was merely an alter ego of its only LLC member, Industrious National. Industrious National denied any responsibility under the lease, saying it was not a party to the lease, and suggested that Industrious Jackson effectively had no assets.

Following a week-long bench trial, the court held the corporate veil should be pierced and assigned liability to Industrious National, the parent company, finding:

Industrious Jackson was a “mere instrumentality” of Industrious National.

Industrious Jackson was used to commit a wrong or fraud.

Stockbridge suffered an unjust injury.

The Illinois appellate court affirmed.

As to the first “mere instrumentality” factor, the court examined “(1) whether the corporation [was] undercapitalized, (2) whether separate books [were] kept, (3) whether there [were] separate finances for the corporation, (4) whether the corporation [was] used for fraud or illegality, (5) whether corporate formalities [had] been followed, and (6) whether the corporation [was] a sham.”

Trial testimony revealed that Industrious Jackson failed to follow corporate formalities. For instance, Industrious Jackson did not have its own employees or officers, did not conduct meetings and did not negotiate its own contracts. Testimony also suggested that “funds flowed freely” between Industrious National and Industrious Jackson. According to the court, “Industrious National … made the decisions which directly led to this litigation, including the decisions to not use available funds to pay rent to Stockbridge Jackson, to create and implement the plan to transfer members to other locations … and to ultimately close the … location.”

Second, the court addressed whether it was established “that Industrious National engaged in deliberate wrongful conduct that either was designed to or did produce injury to Stockbridge Jackson.” Trial testimony supported a finding of “obfuscation or deception vis-à-vis Stockbridge Jackson.” The court found Industrious National had falsely suggested that it would be the tenant on the lease because it provided Stockbridge with its own profit/loss statements and balance sheets, as well as news articles hailing its financial strength. When Stockbridge offered concessions to keep Industrious Jackson as a tenant, Industrious Jackson did not negotiate in good faith and instead used delay tactics to continue using the space without paying rent.

And though Industrious National had enough funds to pay rent in April 2020, the company decided that Industrious Jackson would not make the payment. Instead, Industrious National helped move that location’s members, Industrious Jackson’s primary source of revenue, to one of its other seven co-working locations in Chicago, effectively depriving Industrious Jackson of the ability to pay rent. These facts supported the court’s finding that Industrious National exercised its control over Industrious Jackson “in such a manner as to wrong” Stockbridge.

Lastly, the court determined that Industrious National’s deliberate wrongful actions via Industrious Jackson caused Stockbridge to suffer significant loss. The court noted that Industrious National’s president acknowledged in his testimony that “[Industrious Jackson’s members] were paying rent, Stockbridge was paying its mortgage on the building, and the only one not paying was Industrious Jackson during that time.”

As with most veil-piercing cases, the court focused on whether the parent, Industrious National, had instructed its subsidiary to act in a way that was dishonest and intentionally harmed Stockbridge. The court found that because it had, the corporate veil was pierced.

Other key veil-piercing cases

Below is a summary of other key veil-piercing cases for illustration purposes.

EPLET v. DTE Pontiac North

Courts often focus on ownership and control in veil-piercing cases, which can be particularly challenging when multiple entities are involved. Courts often try to answer the question of which entity is ultimately responsible for the harmful actions.

For instance, EPLET, LLC v. DTE Pontiac North, LLC was a breach-of-contract case arising from General Motors’s bankruptcy. There, GM leased land to DTE Energy Pontiac North (DTEPN). DTEPN agreed to maintain the plant according to specific criteria and to resolve any environmental issues. DTEPN’s parent company, DTE Energy, guaranteed that DTEPN would meet these responsibilities, or DTE Energy itself would step in to fulfill the obligations. But when the lease expired, GM discovered that DTEPN had allowed the plant to fall into disrepair, leading to contamination of the property. GM sued both DTEPN and DTE Energy for breach of contract.

The Sixth Circuit held that DTE Energy should be liable for DTEPN’s alleged wrongs because the decision “to cease maintenance and allow the operational and overall condition of the Leased Premises to deteriorate” was actually made by DTE Energy. This lack of maintenance harmed the grounds, ultimately leading to the contractual breaches, according to the court. Because DTE Energy “exercised its control over DTEPN in a way that wronged [the GM trust],” corporate veil-piercing was appropriate.

People v. V&M Industries

Courts also turn to the presence of corporate formalities to determine whether an entity was a “shell” for its shareholders, members or owners.

In People v. V&M Industries, the state of Illinois sued V&M Industries after over 40,000 tires caught fire on the company’s property and caused significant environmental damage. The Illinois appellate court pierced the corporate veil and held the owner of V&M Industries personally responsible.

In 1981, an individual (Leirer) purchased property in Illinois and incorporated V&M Industries for the sole purpose of renting the property out. One of V&M Industries’ tenants brought tires onto the property to start a tire-shredding operation with Leirer. The agreement eventually fell apart, and the tenant abandoned the tires on the property.

The Illinois Environmental Protection Agency negotiated a tire-removal agreement with Leirer. During the negotiations, Leirer signed all the documents as an authorized representative of V&M Industries and consulted no other corporate officers about the agreement. A corporate meeting never took place on this issue. Leirer never complied with the agreement, and in 1994 the tires on the property caught fire.

The Illinois agency sued Leirer for injunctive relief and civil penalties, arguing that Leirer’s dealings demonstrated that V&M Industries was not separate and distinct from him, and the court agreed.

In its decision, the court held “[a] corporate entity will be disregarded if it would otherwise present an obstacle to the protection of private rights or if the corporation is an alter ego or business conduit of the governing or dominant personality.” The factors the court considered included:

Inadequate capitalization

Failure to issue stock

Failure to observe corporate formalities

Payment of dividends

Insolvency of the debtor corporation at the time

Nonfunctioning of other corporate officers or directors

Absence of corporate records

Whether the corporation is a mere façade for the operation of dominant stockholders

Because those factors were present, the court held the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency could recover civil penalties from Leirer himself such that the corporate veil was pierced.

Waste Conversion Technologies. v. Warren Recycling

To be sure, cases that involve asset transfers from parent corporations to subsidiaries or vice versa, as in Stockbridge 600 West Jackson, do not always result in a piercing of the corporate veil.

In Waste Conversion Technologies, Inc. v. Warren Recycling, Inc., the Sixth Circuit did not find that the corporate veil had been pierced, calling the doctrine a “blunt instrument.” Instead, the court held that fraudulent conveyance law permits creditors to recover the exact value of the asset transferred, making it a more suitable remedy.

The case involved a breach-of-contract claim between Waste Conversion, a middleman between construction companies and landfills, and Warren Recycling, a landfill operation owned by Anthony DiCenso and Gilbert Reiger. Warren Recycling leased the property for its landfill operation from T&G Enterprises/Waste Transfer, a partnership that was also owned by DiCenso and Reiger.

After Waste Conversion filed its complaint for breach of contract, DiCenso and Reiger began negotiating a deal with an outside buyer to sell the landfill operations, which included permits held by Warren Recycling and the land owned by T&G Enterprises/Waste Transfer. Though the deal fell through, Waste Conversion alleged that DiCenso and Reiger tried to get rid of Warren Recycling’s assets — transferring permits to T&G Enterprises/Waste Transfer for no money in return and paying excessive salaries to themselves and their family members — so that recovery would be impossible.

The Sixth Circuit found that these facts did not favor veil-piercing. Though T&G Enterprises/Waste Transfer shared the same ownership as Warren Recycling, T&G Enterprises/Waste Transfer was a distinct entity. During contract negotiations with Waste Conversion, DiCenso and Reiger did not represent that Warren Recycling and T&G Enterprises/Waste Transfer were the same entity. In fact, the court said, the two entities held different assets and separately observed corporate formalities.

In the same vein, the court found that Waste Conversion could not hold Warren Recycling’s shareholders, DiCenso and Reiger, liable. Under Ohio law, plaintiffs seeking to pierce the corporate veil must demonstrate that “the individual shareholders exercised complete control over the corporation so that the corporation had no separate mind of its own” (an alter-ego test), “the control was exercised to commit fraud” and “injury or unjust loss resulted.”

The court held that Warren Recycling’s corporate form was not “a mere shell for DiCenso and Reiger” because they were paid salaries. Nor was there any evidence that DiCenso and Reiger held out or used Warren Recycling’s funds as their own, that they used the corporate form to commit fraud or that they siphoned corporate funds for personal expenses.

But this refusal to pierce Warren Recycling’s corporate veil did not leave Waste Conversion without recourse. The court noted that there may have been a fraudulent conveyance because assets were transferred to shareholders (high salaries) and T&G Enterprises/Waste Transfer (rent and the permits) without receipt of reasonably equivalent value. The equitable solution to this problem, the court said, would be for Waste Conversion to use the bankruptcy courts and “get in line with all the other creditors.”

Best practices to prevent veil-piercing

To minimize the risk of veil-piercing, businesses should rigorously maintain corporate separateness and adhere to the following best practices:

Maintain distinct operations. Ensure each entity has separate bank accounts, corporate documents, meeting minutes, office space and decision-making processes.

Avoid commingling funds. Do not mix funds between entities. Document any inter-entity transactions in writing, at market terms and at arm’s length.

Adequate capitalization. Each entity should be sufficiently capitalized to meet its obligations independently.

Independent decision-making. All business decisions should be made by authorized agents of the entity, with clear documentation.

Proper use of entity name. Use the full legal name of the entity on all contracts and documents and ensure signatures are made on behalf of the correct entity.

Observe corporate formalities. Hold regular meetings, maintain accurate records and ensure all required filings and formalities are observed.

Avoid abuse of the corporate form. Understand that courts are more likely to pierce the veil where there is evidence of fraud, unfairness or abuse of the corporate structure.",https://www.corporatecomplianceinsights.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/separation-of-entities-concept-converging-bodies-of-water.jpg,N,,2025-12-29 08:57:59.412289

When the Montana federal coal auction came on Oct. 6, NTEC — the lone bidder — offered just $186,000.
Nuclear contention Growing interest in nuclear energy proved particularly divisive in Wyoming.
The issue ignited tensions that drew political divisions and, ultimately, led to Radiant scrapping its Wyoming plans in October.
Both proposals came amid intense legislative debate and a Gordon-backed Wyoming-Idaho-Utah alliance to center America’s nuclear energy resurgence in the region.","Wind turbines continued to sprout across Wyoming this year as legacy oil and natural gas industries weathered bumps in the market, uranium mines resumed operations and coal companies held out hope for brighter days.

It was also the year that a vast majority of Wyomingites woke up to climate change, according to a University of Wyoming survey that showed 86% believe it is happening and they are alarmed at what it portends for the state’s scant water resources.

But Wyoming’s most significant energy headlines of 2025 — even beyond the proliferation of data center plans that would double the state’s electrical demand and intense debate over nuclear energy projects — were President Donald Trump’s sweeping, incessant slashing of federal regulations to boost fossil fuels and orders to rebuff renewable energy.

Sweeping federal policy

On his first day back in the White House, Trump signed the “Unleashing American Energy” executive order, which, among other things, directed federal agencies to repeal “all ‘greenhouse gas’ emissions standards for the power sector,” as well as Biden-era Mercury and Air Toxics Standards. The order also directed the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to “reconsider” the landmark 2009 endangerment finding that determined greenhouse gases cause harm and compelled past administrations to curb their emissions.

The president tapped Wyoming’s own Cyrus Western, a former Wyoming lawmaker, to lead the EPA’s Region 8 office overseeing much of the Rockies Region, including Wyoming.

“I think President Trump has been really clear that he wants to take a very different direction and work with the states, help encourage industry, but also simultaneously ensuring that the communities do have access to clean water, that their air is clean, that kind of stuff,” Western told WyoFile in March.

The GOP-led Congress followed Trump’s lead in prioritizing fossil fuels in July with provisions in the Big Beautiful Bill that slashed royalty rates for coal, oil and natural gas. While cheered by Wyoming’s extractive industries, WyoFile reported the cuts will choke the flow of federal dollars — a $50 million annual loss for the state on coal royalties alone.

Still, Trump’s efforts won praise from Wyoming’s congressional delegation and Gov. Mark Gordon, who celebrated the “immediate change in approach” to federal energy policies and described the new direction as “a win for U.S. energy and Wyoming.”

Wyoming conservation groups decried the moves, which included an overhaul of the planning processes for public lands. The sweeping changes, they said, are a threat to the state’s wildlife and an outdoor recreation economy that heavily relies on federal public lands, including the already climate-stressed Red Desert.

“The Trump administration has obviously led with prioritizing extractive industries over all other uses on public lands,” Wyoming Outdoor Council Conservation Director Alec Underwood told WyoFile in September.

Coal lease flop

Trump’s effort to “unlock” federal coal reserves in Wyoming and Montana failed spectacularly, at the hands of a coal mining company with operations in the Powder River Basin.

Based on the premise that a Biden-era ban on future coal leasing in the region hamstrings a soon-to-be resurrected industry, the U.S. Bureau of Land Management scoured the books for federal coal leases that had gone dormant and could be put up for sale. The agency cleared the decks for a 167 million-ton coal lease auction in Montana for a single, apparent bidder, Navajo Transitional Energy Company. Before that auction took place, the administration announced it would also revive a years-long lingering 441 million-ton federal coal tract in Wyoming for auction — again, enticing the single, apparent bidder NTEC, which had not asked for the opportunity, a company official told WyoFile.

When the Montana federal coal auction came on Oct. 6, NTEC — the lone bidder — offered just $186,000. In 2012, the last time the industry demanded a major federal lease sale in the region, the bid was $1.10 per ton. This time around, NTEC’s fraction-of-a-penny per ton bid spurred the administration to indefinitely postpone the 441-million-ton auction scheduled for days later in Wyoming.

“It tells you that there’s no competition for that coal in the ground, and it’s not worth very much money,” Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis Energy Data Analyst Seth Feaster told WyoFile.

Despite those results, Wyoming’s congressional delegation in November led an effort to bypass the enshrined public-input process for crafting BLM land management plans by invoking the rarely used Congressional Review Act. The move invalidated the agency’s Wyoming and Montana resource management plans for the sole purpose — according to the delegation — of overturning the ban on future leasing. Trump signed the law in December.

Nuclear contention

Growing interest in nuclear energy proved particularly divisive in Wyoming.

While the $4 billion Natrium “advanced” nuclear power plant continued construction near Kemmerer and notched permitting milestones — thanks in part to Trump executive orders to fast-track such endeavors — the towns of Bar Nunn and Gillette weighed other high-dollar nuclear proposals.

California-based Radiant Industries both enthralled and alarmed Bar Nunn and Natrona County residents with its proposal to manufacture nuclear microreactors for global deployment. The plan, however, would have required an exception to Wyoming’s partial ban on spent nuclear fuel waste storage. The issue ignited tensions that drew political divisions and, ultimately, led to Radiant scrapping its Wyoming plans in October.

Longtime U.S. Navy contractor BWXT, meantime, introduced its own plans in Gillette: a nuclear fuel manufacturing plant that does not involve spent nuclear fuel storage. In December, Gordon awarded BWXT a $100 million grant to support the project.

Both proposals came amid intense legislative debate and a Gordon-backed Wyoming-Idaho-Utah alliance to center America’s nuclear energy resurgence in the region.

Climate contention

A whopping 86% of residents (compared to 55% in 2014) believe climate change is happening, University of Wyoming researchers reported. And, researchers said, most respondents didn’t know their neighbors felt the same.

There was evidence, though, when a crowd of voters in Pinedale booed Rep. Harriet Hageman when she used the phrase “absolutely based on false science” to describe the 2009 endangerment finding — the federal doctrine to combat air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. And when Freedom Caucus members sought to make carbon dioxide great again with a bill to outlaw greenhouse gas reduction efforts, their legislative colleagues shot it down.",https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Dirt-shovel-Belle-Ayr-coal-mine-DBleizeffer.jpeg?fit=1200%2C905&ssl=1,N,,2025-12-29 07:12:32.443591

On December 11, 2025, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Air and Radiation (OAR), launched a new webpage entitled the Clean Air Act Resource for Data Centers. The site centralizes regulatory data, modeling tools, and permitting guidance. Designed to accelerate data center construction, the OAR staff is also available for case-by-case consultations with permit authorities and developers. The website has three primary categories:

Regulator Resources: Focuses on power sources, a major concern for planning data centers and AI infrastructure. Common sources of primary and backup power are subject to New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) for certain air emissions and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP).

Air Permitting Resources: Aggregates guidance documents and historical interpretation letters to see how EPA has handled similar permitting requests in the past, offering a clearer picture of statutory obligations under New Source Review (NSR) requirements and federal regulations.

Modeling Guidance: Provides access to the EPA’s “Guideline on Air Quality Models,” offering technical methods for demonstrating Clean Air Act (CAA) and NO2 National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) compliance during planning.

The EPA initiative aims to help businesses and communities navigate federal air quality rules, specifically under the Clean Air Act (CAA) requirements that EPA acknowledges are essential for pollution control. Officials stated the webpage will be updated continuously as the agency moves to reform industry guidance for data center developers.

The EPA did not specify what it intends to change, but said it will clarify how the regulations apply to modern facilities. The administration contends that streamlined development will ultimately protect consumers from rising electricity rates and cost-of-living increases.

According to the Georgetown Law Review, Bloomberg, and Utility Dive, communities and states that allow data center growth are experiencing substantial increases in utility costs, up to 267% over five years [1].

While it is not unusual for local taxpayers to cover part of the infrastructure costs, many consumers were unaware of just how substantial those costs are for data centers [2].

According to the Georgetown Law Review, there is currently no concise federal framework for regulating data center development, leaving regulation largely up to the individual states. However, a bill introduced by Senators Whitehouse and Fetterman, the Clean Cloud Act of 2025, would amend the Clean Air Act to set emissions standards for servers and other equipment used in data centers or crypto-mining facilities, and to require data collection on energy consumption. The Senate read the proposed bill and then referred it to the Committee on Environment and Public Works [3].

Electrical systems and ongoing energy systems account for the lion’s share of capital expenses and operational costs. There is a cost of land, but companies are now seeking to use Brownfields to obtain parcels closer to urban areas with more infrastructure.

The environmental impacts discussed here affect air quality because the massive amounts of electricity data centers consume to crunch data and keep systems cool are primarily generated by fossil fuels. Total global consumption of electrical power by data centers is anticipated to jump, with AI-optimized centers expected to see demand quadruple; AI’s share of data center power could rise from 5-15% to 35-50% by 2030 [4].

Our dependence is driving up carbon emissions and exacerbating global warming issues. Developing greener cooling methods for data centers will help minimize environmental impacts on air quality and reduce strains on local water resources for cooling [5]. That’s where SCS Engineers can help.

And the Maricopa County Air Quality Department is urging residents to help keep skies clearer for New Year’s 2026.

The Valley is shaped like a big bowl, and in the winter, cooler weather creates a pressure change that pushes pollution lower to the earth, trapping it right over the city, said Maricopa County Air Quality Department spokesperson Ari Halpert.

On New Year’s Eve, at-home fireworks supercharge the problem.

“Jan. 1, 2025 we had the third-worst air quality in the world, the worst in the nation, and the main culprit for that were consumer fireworks,” Halpert said. “We ask everyone to celebrate in a different way.”

“Professional fireworks explode up in the atmosphere and have a chance to disperse all that pollution, so it doesn’t pose as big of a threat as these consumer fireworks,” Halpert said.

Halpert said another important way to keep pollution at bay is not to burn wood in your fireplace or outdoor fire pit.

Halpert said smoke from wood burning and fireworks can be harmful to everyone. Tiny particulates get deep into the lungs, which can worsen respiratory issues like asthma or bronchitis.

“They also carry toxins that can reach our bloodstream and exacerbate or pose a danger to our cardiac health,” Halpert said.

That means that the global market for cars that run on gas or diesel is shrinking, while the market for battery-powered cars is expanding — and China is dominating it.","The electric vehicle industry has taken a pummeling this year. The Trump administration, as expected, reversed a whole suite of federal policies that promoted or encouraged EVs.

California's ability to require the sale of EVs: gone. Federal rules about emissions and fuel economy — being rewritten. Federal penalties for car companies that sell too many gas guzzlers: zeroed out. The $7,500 federal tax credit? Kaput.

Meanwhile, automakers delayed or canceled a host of unprofitable EV plans.

The all-electric Ram 1500 REV was canceled before a single one was built. The all-electric Ford Lightning was discontinued despite some glowing reviews. (Both pickups will be replaced with extended-range electric vehicles, which come with both a big battery and a backup gas tank.)

The buzzy Volkswagen Buzz is still available in other countries, but no longer in the U.S. The GM Brightdrop van is no more. The list goes on.

As for sales? ""It's a roller-coaster ride,"" says Stephanie Valdez Streaty, who monitors EVs for the data and services company Cox Automotive.

Sales spiked in August and September, during the last weeks that the federal tax credit was available, as buyers rushed to take advantage of the expiring opportunity. Cox estimated EVs hit an all-time high of 11.6% of the new vehicle market in September. Then sales crashed by 50% in October.

But here's a twist.

""Among U.S. shoppers who are in [the] market for new vehicles, the interest in electric vehicles actually ticked up a bit after the tax credit went away,"" says Brent Gruber, who runs the EV practice at consumer insights company J.D. Power.

It's the EV story you might not have heard this year: Despite the political and product planning whiplash, consumer appetite for EVs has been on a very smooth ride.

Overall, about 25% of new car shoppers are very interested in buying an EV, according to J.D. Power surveys. And with minor fluctuations, ""it's held pretty consistent,"" Gruber says, despite what he calls the ""turbulence"" of this year.

""There's still a tremendous amount of interest,"" he says. ""And from an EV owner perspective, we continue to see high levels of satisfaction once people do get into those products."" In fact, EV owners are 94% likely to repurchase another EV for their next vehicle, he says.

BJ Birtwell runs the Electrify Expo, a traveling festival dedicated to EVs. He says EVs have suffered from being politicized, with a lot of right-of-center Americans rejecting them out of hand.

""There's still a cloud of skepticism around EVs across some parts of the country,"" he says. But put a skeptic behind the wheel of a new EV, he says, ""and I'll tell you what I see: Smiles for miles."" Test drives reveal the cars are fun to drive, he says, and a little research can show that charging at home is easier and cheaper than they thought.

An American slowdown

Still, while Americans remain interested in EVs, it's undeniable that battery-powered vehicles are taking off more slowly than industry execs expected a few years ago. That's not just because of the policy reversal; it's also because of market realities. For example, while charging might be easy at home, it's a hassle for apartment dwellers who don't have that option. Meanwhile, vehicle prices — a challenge for the entire auto market — are even higher for EVs. Lower fuel and maintenance costs can't always overcome that up-front sticker shock, even for people who are hypothetically interested in buying.

This slowdown will have global consequences for the environment and for human beings: It locks in higher carbon emissions and air pollution for years to come.

The legacy automakers, of course, have lost billions of dollars on the EV designs they've canceled or postponed. But the delay hurts more than just the big-name auto brands. A whole network of suppliers sell parts to the automakers, and they also bear the burden when plans change.

Ken O'Trakoun of RPM Partners works with auto suppliers in distress. ""The whiplash,"" he says, ""between demand going up and demand receding, it has impacted a number of suppliers."" They made investments in factories to supply automakers for vehicles that either aren't being made, or are being made at much lower volumes. ""It's pretty disruptive.""

The ""ripple effect"" from those suppliers ""creates impacts on jobs,"" Valdez-Streaty notes.

Automakers, too, have laid off or reassigned employees away from battery plants and EV production lines as part of their adjusted timelines.

A clear global trend

But while automakers are slowing their EV plans down significantly, they're not giving up on them, either.

Partly that's because of the enduring consumer interest; as long as there's a market, the automakers want to serve it. And partly that's because the automakers are all global companies. They want to be able to sell to the rest of the world, too.

""On a global scale, internal combustion engine cars already peaked back, like, eight or nine years ago,"" says Huiling Zhou, U.S. EV analyst for the research group BloombergNEF.

About one in four cars sold worldwide this year was electric, Zhou says — driven by China's remarkably fast embrace of those vehicles. And China, increasingly, is exporting cars around the world.

That means that the global market for cars that run on gas or diesel is shrinking, while the market for battery-powered cars is expanding — and China is dominating it.

If automakers want to compete around the world, they simply can't afford to get off the EV roller coaster.

The Year-End Takeaway In 2025, ex-China rare earth strategy moved from aspiration to architecture.","Highlights

In 2025, Western rare earth strategy evolved from PowerPoints to funded infrastructure:

Upstream mines like MP Materials and Lynas became state-backed assets.

Midstream separation plants in the U.S., Europe, and Australia secured billions in financing and broke ground.

Downstream magnet facilities began commercial production for the first time this century.

Heavy rare earths (Dy/Tb) remain the critical bottleneck:

Malaysia emerged as a strategic battleground.

New processing facilities from ReElement, Ucore, Carester, and ANSTO raced to break China’s 85% control of global refining capacity.

Despite aggressive U.S. policy momentum and President Trump’s optimistic 2026 timeline:

Structural gaps in refining capacity, feedstock availability, and permitting suggest true supply-demand balance for non-China magnets won’t arrive until 2028–2030.

This leaves defense, EV, and clean energy sectors exposed to sustained supply risk.

In 2025, rare earths stopped being a niche “materials story” and became a full-spectrum industrial race. President Trump’s administration, while we suggest needs to do far more to accelerate the ex-China rare earth element (REE) supply chain, deserves credit for generating what is certainty substantial momentum. The first such president to do this since the entire value chain was outsourced overthe past couple decades. The year delivered a surge ofgovernment-initiated financings, offtakes, and build-and-buy partnerships designed to pry open supply chains long locked inside China’s midstream. The plotline wasn’t subtle: secure the mine, build the refinery, control the magnet. And if you couldn’t do all three, you partnered with someone who could.

Below is the year’s big picture—organized by the only structure that matters in rare earths: upstream mining, midstream processing, and downstream magnets. Importantly this was an exciting year, part of a great supply chain reawakening.

Upstream: Mines Become National Assets

MP Materials (NYSE:MP) went from “America’s only major rare earth mine” to a state-backed industrial anchor. The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD)struck a long-term partnership with a $110/kg NdPr price floor andsupport aimed at scaling magnet output and domestic capability. The Pentagon would have access to 15% of the national rare earth “treasure trove.” Then came the geopolitical flourish: MP and Saudi national mining company Ma’aden inked a term sheet for a Saudi refining joint venture, explicitly framed as de-risking reliance on China.

The catch remains execution: scaling is brutal, and heavy rare earth feed (Dy/Tb) is still the hard part. An early inning in a nine inning game at least. But has MP Materials emerged as too big to fail?

Lynas Rare Earths (LYX.AC), the world’s largest ex-China producer, raised A$750 million and continued to prove that ex-China production is possible—but not easy. Its U.S. heavy processing ambitions in Texas ran into uncertainty and cost pressure, reinforcing a core truth: midstream in the West is slow, capital-intensive, and politically exposed. Meanwhile, Lynas deepened the Malaysia footprint and backed a magnet plant partnership with Korea’s JS Link, making Malaysia not a footnote but a battleground. Lynas recently shipped some heavy rare earths to offtake partners in Japan.

Lynas and Sumitomo have a long-standing strategic partnership, backed by Japan's Organization for Metals and Energy Security (JOGMEC), to secure stable supplies of rare earths (both light REEs and increasingly heavy REEs like Dysprosium/Terbium) for Japanese industry, especially magnets for EVs and wind turbines, with Sumitomo acting as a key distributor, diversifying away from China's dominance. Sumitomo also partners with others like MP Materials and Victory for even broader HRE supply.

Arafura Rare Earths (ARU.AX) pushed its Nolans project toward the brink of full construction readiness,bolstered by major financing momentum and heavyweight backing. Thesignal for investors: Australia is trying to turn rare earths into an export-grade industrial platform, not just a quarry.

Arafura Rare Earths looks promising because it is advancing one of the few fully integrated rare earth projects outside China—again, the Nolans Project in Australia—with a clear pathway to produce NdPr carbonates and downstream separated oxides, supported by strategic offtake agreements, established funding, and strong technical progress; its combination of substantial, high-quality ionic clay resources, experienced management, and proximity to emerging refining infrastructure positions it to be a cornerstone supplier into Western magnet and EV supply chains. The company needs to improve education and awareness about its’ potential.

USA Rare Earth **(NASDAQ:USAR)**aims to create a domestic ""mine-to-magnet"" supply chainfor critical REEs for defense & green tech, leveraging its Round Topproject in Texas for resources and partnering for magnet production. The key risks involve significant capital needs, complex permitting, competition from China, delays in mine development (Round Top is still exploratory), technical hurdles in refining magnet making (the group acquired Less Common Metals to mitigate some risk) and overall market volatility, despite strong government interest and potential, making it a speculative venture.

Serra Verde (backed by Denham Capital and Energy & Minerals Group) in Brazil delivered one of the year’s sharpest strategic moves: it shortened long Chinese offtake commitments to free up supply for Western buyers as new separation plants come online. It also had the kind of financing stamp Western governments now reserve for strategic minerals: a $465 million DFC loan. The message was blunt: heavy rare earths outside China are scarce, and those who have them get courted.

Aclara Resources (ARA.TO) announced plans for a $277 million heavy rare earth separation facility in Louisiana, with a timeline targeting end-2027 construction and production ramp thereafter—an explicit attempt to end the U.S. heavy rare earth dependency trap.

And in Africa-to-Australia integration, Iluka Resources (ILU.AX) secured a binding deal with Lindian Resources (LIN.AX) for 6,000 tpa of concentrate for 15 years—a rare case of upstream being contractually snapped into a midstream refinery plan.

In 2025, Pensana Plc (PRE.L) accelerated its Longonjo rare earth project in Angola while pivoting hard toward a U.S.-aligned “mine-to-magnet” strategy: it advanced mine development and construction planning, announced downstream partnerships to anchor future demand (including an MoU with rare earth recycling and refining specialist ReElement Technologies tied to potential U.S. refining integration and large-volume mixed rare earth carbonate offtake discussions), pursued U.S. government-linked financing via EXIM under supply-chain resiliency frameworks (explicitly positioning Longonjo output to qualify for U.S.-backed debt support), signed a magnet supply-chain linkage through a VAC/eVAC-related arrangement to connect Longonjo product into U.S. magnet manufacturing, and capped the year by securing a US$100 million strategic equity investment to fund drilling, mine development momentum, and the broader U.S. supply-chain pivot—steps that collectively signaled Pensana’s shift from a UK-centered refinery narrative toward U.S.-supported industrial policy gravity.

In 2025, Brazilian Rare Earths (BRE.XA) made significant strides in advancing its Monte Alto rare earth project by securing approximately A$120 million in financing to fund exploration, development, and early works, bolstering its financial position as one of the better-capitalized rare earth juniors. A cornerstone of BRE’s year was a strategic long-term partnership with French processor Carester, under which BRE agreed to supply heavy rare earth concentrate (with a focus on dysprosium and terbium) to Carester’s new Caremag separation plant in France for up to 10 years, effectively anchoring future processing of Brazilian product into a European midstream facility and de-risking future offtake. In return, Carester agreed to assist BRE in advancing its own refinery plans in Brazil and provided technical and commercial collaboration across the value chain, positioning BRE as a key supplier into European and allied rare earth supply networks outside China.

A partially American-owned startup called DTEC MMT arrived in Malaysia to secure upstream product paired with innovative refining options. What plans will the venture disclose in 2026?

What about rare earth mining veteran James Kennedy and the Pea Ridge mine. Supposedly substantial heavy rare earth can be derived from the tailings. Can Caldera Holding secure the capital to exploit the asset?

Midstream: Separation Plants Finally Leave the PowerPoint Stage

2025’s defining shift: processing ceased to be a “someday” ambition and became funded steel, poured concrete, and signed feedstock.

In the U.S., the year’s most consequential announcements attached real money to real capacity: Vulcan Elements + ReElement Technologies landed a substantial public-private package (700 million in direct U.S. Department of War (OSC) loans, $50 million in Commerce CHIPS Act incentives, and over $550 million in private capital) aimed at building domestic NdFeB magnets and expanding recycling and processing—an industrial chain from scrap to magnet.

ReElement Technologies touts an advanced chromatographic separation and purification platform—derived from patented research at Purdue University—to refine rare earth elements and critical battery metals from both virgin ores and recycled feedstocks such as end-of-life permanent magnets, lithium-ion batteries, and manufacturing waste. If this works at scale, this chromatography-based process could replace traditional solvent extraction, enabling high-purity rare earth oxides and critical elements with higher efficiency, lower energy use, drastically reduced waste, and a smaller environmental footprint compared with conventional methods, while also purportedly being modular, scalable, and deployable on smaller footprints or co-located with mine or manufacturing sites.

MP Materials as cited above secured $150 million from the government to develop heavy REE processing.

In 2025, Energy Fuels (UUUU) achieved significant rare earth refining milestones at its White Mesa Mill in Utah, focusing on establishing a fully domestic supply chain for magnet materials. Key accomplishments include the pilot production and qualification of heavy rare earth oxides (HREEs) and the successful use of its light rare earth oxide (LREE) product in commercial magnets. While mostly focused on processing uranium, the company’s refining focus positions it well for organic American REE refining growth.

Ucore Rare Metals' major 2025 milestones centered on advancing its U.S. heavy rare earth processing in Louisiana, securing significant funding (including a $18.4M DoD award), breaking ground on the Strategic Metals Complex (SMC) in May, and achieving key technology validations with the US DoD for HREE separation. Is the company positioned to build one of North America's first HREE separation facilities based on their RapidSX™ (opens in a new tab) technology?

In 2025,European rare earth refining has seen notable developments involving Solvay and Carester, both working to strengthen Western processing capacity outside China. Solvay expanded and inaugurated a rare earth production line at its La Rochelle, France facility in April 2025, beginning commercial production of materials for permanent magnets and later securing contracts to supply key rare earth oxides to U.S. magnet makers, underscoring its growing role in Western supply chains.

Meanwhile, French start-up Carester’s Caremag project in Lacq secured €216 million in financing in March 2025 to build a large-scale rare earth recycling and refining plant that aims to produce significant volumes of heavy and light rare earth oxides by 2026, positioning Europe to capture a meaningful share of global refined output. The two companies previously signed a strategic memorandum of understanding to collaborate on rare earth permanent magnet value-chain activities, combining Solvay’s industrial processing experience with Carester’s recycling and upstream expertise to bolster European refining autonomy.

Canada based Neo Performance Materials (NEO.TO) has made significant strides toward regional supply chain independence from China (although they still have at least two plants in China). Neo already operates Silmet, the only commercial rare earth separation plant in the EU located in Sillamäe, Estonia, and in September 2025 officially opened a new permanent rare earth magnet manufacturing facility in Narva, Estonia, marking the first large-scale production of rare earth magnets in Europe for electric vehicles and wind turbines and receiving attention from European Commission leadership as part of broader EU industrial policy support.

The Saskatchewan Research Council (SRC) in Canada has made significant progress toward establishing a vertically integrated rare earth refining capability in North America by constructing and advancing its state-of-the-art Rare Earth Processing Facility in Saskatoon,Saskatchewan. Since the project’s launch in 2020 withsubstantial provincial and federal support, SRC has developed proprietary hydrometallurgical, solvent-extraction, and metal smelting technologies in-house and has already achieved commercial-scale production of rare earth metals, notably high-purity NdPr, with plans to scale output further toward annual targets in the 400–600 tonne range—enough to support hundreds of thousands of electric vehicles.

SRC’s facility, slated for full operation by early 2027, has secured major offtake partnerships and feasibility studies for an expanded processing and metallization complex, reinforcing Saskatchewan’s role as a growing possible global hub for rare earth supply chain development and helping reduce North American dependence on overseas processors.

In Australia, the Iluka refinery strategy hardened around one key point: refineries are only as real as their feed contracts—hence the Iluka Resources and Lindian supply agreement and broader feedstock hunt.

Australia is hopefully set to close a critical gap in the global rare earth supply chain with the opening of its first open-access rare earth processing facility in early 2026, built and operated by Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO) at Lucas Heights. Taxpayer-funded and designed as shared national infrastructure, the facility directly tackles the long-standing contradiction that saw Australia—one of the world’s top rare earth producers—export 100% of its concentrates overseas, largely to China, for refining. Purpose-built for clay-hosted and ionic adsorption deposits, the plant will enable end-to-end pilot-scale processing from desorption through impurity removal to separated oxides, with Australian Rare Earths’ Koppamurra project as the first test case.

Strategically, the move reflects a clear policy shift: acknowledging that rare earth refining, unlike mining, rarely emerges without sustained state support—a reality underpinning China’s roughly 85% control of global processing capacity. While the ANSTO facility materially de-risks metallurgy and breaks the chicken-and-egg deadlock between miners and processors, social license, permitting, and commercial viability remain unresolved, underscoring that public infrastructure can enable—but not guarantee—the success of rare earth supply chains outside China.

And then there’s Malaysia, where the world learned (again) that rare earths don’t just run through geology—they run through chemistry and politics. Malaysia is pushing to keep value-add at home (including a ban on raw exports), while courting foreign partners and navigating public pressure around processing footprints. Alongside Lynas, Southern Alliance Mining’s (QNS.SI) strategic entry into rare earths via MCRE underscored Malaysia’s emergence as a contested node—complete with regulatory friction and scrutiny. Known as “SAM” much of its business today is with Chinese buyers. Will that change in 2026?

Ground breaking of a $400 million critical metals refinery purportedly commenced in Nigeria with privately held Hasetins Commodities Limited.

Downstream: The Magnet Renaissance Begins

If 2024 was about mines and 2025 about refineries, 2025 also quietly became the year magnets started shipping.

In 2025, the DoD struck a multibillion-dollar public-private partnership with MP Materials to accelerate a sovereign U.S. rare earth magnet supply chain anchored by a new “10X Facility,” a second domestic magnet plant expected to begin commissioning in 2028 and bring total U.S. magnet production capacity to about 10,000 metric tons per year if all goes according to plan. Apple piled on with a $500 million commitment tied to a U.S. magnet supply chain and a new recycling facility—rare earth circularity as industrial policy.

Germany’s VACUUMSCHMELZE (VAC), through eVAC Magnetics, shipped some of the first U.S.-made commercial NdFeB magnets in this century from South Carolina—symbolism with industrial teeth.

In 2025, American rare earth magnet makers have marked several key milestones as the U.S. works to build more resilient domestic supply chains: Permag emerged in June 2025 as a unified brand consolidating Dexter Magnetic Technologies, Electron Energy Corporation (EEC), and Magnetic Component Engineering (MCE), creating the only vertically integrated North American producer of high-performance magnets (especially Samarium-Cobalt) and advancing DFARS-compliance efforts for defense and aerospace applications. EEC, now a core part of Permag, doubled its SmCo manufacturing capacity at its Pennsylvania facility to bolster U.S. domestic production and reduce reliance on imports. Arnold Magnetic Technologies expanded strategic supply agreements in 2025 to secure rare earth materials outside China and is investing in supply chain continuity and compliance with upcoming DFARS standards for NdFeB and SmCo magnets.

Meanwhile, Noveon Magnetics continued scaling its Texas rare-earth magnet facility, exemplifying broader U.S. efforts to grow commercial magnet capacity. The company has been producing American-made NdFeB magnets at commercial scale in San Marcos since 2023, and continue to actively ship finished magnets to customers.

These developments reflect a concerted industry push in 2025 to strengthen domestic rare earth magnet manufacturing across defense, automotive, and industrial sectors.

South Korean cable giant LS Cable & System (LS C&S) has announced intention to invest in rare earth magnet production in the U.S. According to announcements a $689 million facility in Chesapeake, Virginia meant to secure supply chains for EVs, defense, and aerospace. This expansion builds on their existing cable ventures and aims to create a complete rare earth value chain, from securing oxides to final magnet manufacturing.

Vulcan Element’s planned 10,000-ton magnet facility (with federal loans and private capital) signaled a new doctrine: the U.S. doesn’t want “some” magnets; it wants a scale platform and this deal, while early stage, is meant to support such an endeavor.

POSCO International, a large steelmaker in Korea, and its partner Star Group Industrial Co looking to develop magnet making with Arafura feedstock.

In 2025, JS Link America—the U.S. subsidiary of South Korea’s JS Link—announced a $223 million investment to build a rare earth permanent magnet manufacturing facility in Columbus, Georgia, as part of broader efforts to diversify Western supply chains and reduce reliance on China. The planned 130,000 sq ft plant, to be located in Muscogee Technology Park, is expected to produce about 3,000 tons of permanent magnets annually and create over 520 jobs in engineering, production, and management, with operations slated to begin in late 2027.

The project underscores Georgia’s growing role in critical minerals and advanced manufacturing, and reflects JS Link’s strategy of linking U.S. production with its other facilities—including a magnet plant nearing completion in Yesan, Korea—while targeting supply to key sectors such as electric vehicles, wind energy, electronics, and defense systems

On the topic ofmagnets, the underlying truth is ruthless: magnets are the value capture point. Whoever owns magnets owns the downstream leverage over EVs, wind, drones, missiles, robotics—modern industry’s muscle memory.

While President Trump has publicly declared that the United States will soon have “more magnets than it knows what to do with” by the end of 2026, Rare Earth Exchanges’ modeling suggests a far more constrained reality. Even with accelerated mine development, new processing capacity, and a wave of announced magnet plants, the tightest bottleneck—ex-China rare earth refining and magnet-grade material availability—remains unresolved.

According to Rare Earth Exchanges’ simulations, persistent structural gaps in heavy rare earth separation, qualified feedstock availability, workforce readiness, and permitting timelines make true supply–demand balance for domestically produced, non-China magnets unlikely before 2028—and quite possibly not until 2030 or later—leaving U.S. automakers, defense contractors, clean-energy manufacturers, and fast-scaling sectors such as drones, robotics, and advanced electronics exposed to sustained supply risk well beyond today’s political timelines.

The Year-End Takeaway

In 2025, ex-China rare earth strategy moved from aspiration to architecture. Upstream projects secured lifelines. Midstream refineries stopped being theoretical. Downstream magnets began to ship. But the vulnerabilities didn’t disappear—they became clearer:

Execution risk is the tax on every Western project.

Heavyrare earths (Dy/Tb) remain the tightest choke point, extremely tight.

Malaysia is now a strategic arena, not a side plot.

Vietnam declared at end of year it’s treasure trove will not be available without processing investment

And industrial policy is back—not as ideology, but as emergency construction.

While President Trump’s administration gets a solid A for intent, initiation and leadership, the team, unfortunately still grades lower for the necessary rare earth and critical mineral industrial policy comprehensiveness and durability necessary for true resilience within the next several years. We need to work on Washington DC in 2026 to intensify and accelerate such efforts.

2025 didn’t end China’s dominance. It ended the West’s illusion that dominance could be competed against without building the chain.",https://rareearthexchanges.com/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=rank_math_overlay_thumb&id=8196&type=rare-earth-exchanges&hash=17ba0f41ccc23391c2824cd370af5649,N,,2025-12-29 07:58:07.307394

Operating a BESS for the First Time: Lessons Learned, Challenges Faced, and Analytics in Action

With TWAICE, September 2025

BESS assets are rapidly becoming a critical component of modern power systems. But what is it really like to operate one for the first time?

Watch this exclusive session to hear directly from the teams behind one of the biggest BESS deployments in the Central American and Caribbean region.

Industry leaders from InterEnergy and TWAICE present their real-world experience operating a BESS from the ground up. We learn about the unique challenges encountered—from system integration with PV assets to performance optimisation under dynamic grid conditions—and how decisions made early in the lifecycle can have long-term impacts. Attendees also gained insight into how data analytics software can become a powerful tool for optimising BESS performance, improving reliability, reducing operating costs, and anticipating failures.

LT2029 and the Future of Grid Stability: Envision’s Proven Solutions for Great Britain

With Envision Energy, September 2025

This webinar focuses on a topic that the global industry is gradually beginning to recognise: the need for low-carbon sources to provide system stability services traditionally played by thermal generation assets.

As the term strongly implies, these services, which include inertia and short-circuit ratio, are necessary for the stable functioning of the electricity grid.

The UK’s LT2029 is the first formal Y-4 market-based procurement designed to secure stability, reactive power, and restoration for the grid. This webinar unpacked the key requirements—from national inertia and location-specific reactive power needs to the role of anchor and top-up providers in restoration—and explained what they mean for market participants.

Demystifying the BESS performance metrics that matter most: SoC, SoH, cell imbalance and RTE

With Wärtsilä, October 2025

In the rapidly evolving global energy landscape, battery energy storage has emerged as a cornerstone for ensuring grid stability and efficiency. From helping stabilise data centre loads, to being deployed as a means of grid modernisation, to supporting the proliferation of renewables, as the world transitions towards widespread electrification, the role of BESS becomes increasingly critical.

However, misunderstood metrics are quietly eroding the performance and profitability of these systems.

Wärtsilä battery analytics experts Andrea Meister and Steve Merrick present a critical session that cuts through the confusion surrounding state of charge (SoC), state of health (SoH), cell imbalance, and round-trip efficiency (RTE)—parameters that directly impact real-time operations and revenue.",https://www.energy-storage.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ESN-Virtual-BG-for-webinars_1280x720-1-flipped.jpg,N,,2025-12-29 10:01:00.808735

Why Are Freshmen Sticking Around?,Not Available,,,,,https://www.notus.org/congress/freshman-lawmakers-congressional-approval-ratings,"And as new members look on at the senior lawmakers sprinting from Capitol Hill, they sympathize.
But unlike the senior members who have been beaten down by those realities, the freshmen have chosen to jump into Congress — and stick around to repair it.
“Everyone hates Congress,” Rep. Suhas Subramanyam of Virginia told NOTUS, “and people feel the same frustration I feel about the institution.
“Things are slower,” Republican Rep. Julie Fedorchak told NOTUS.
But there are, of course, fundamental challenges with the premise that members of Congress can keep their heads down and form collegial relationships.","“One of the big reasons I wanted to run for Congress was to actually fight back against the toxic environment that is pervasive here,” Rep. Johnny Olszewski said from his office on Capitol Hill on a dreary December Wednesday.

“I joke with constituents back home,” he said. “They ask me, ‘Is D.C. really as bad as it seems?’”

“I say, ‘No. It’s worse.’”

Olszewski, a 43-year-old Maryland Democrat on the cusp of finishing out his first year in Congress, laughed in a way that made clear he had practiced the punchline. But over the course of an interview with NOTUS, it became apparent that the congressman wasn’t kidding.

The performative nature of national politics in 2025 has been more theatrical, and personal, than Olszewski had imagined. Getting to know Republican colleagues has been harder than he’d anticipated. Policymaking has been more dilatory than the local politics to which he had become accustomed. Commuting, even back to his district in Baltimore, is more taxing than expected. And, once, when Olszewski proposed what he thought was a common-sense amendment to a government funding bill — only one lawmaker showed up to a Rules Committee hearing to consider it.

“There’s a reason that Congress has a 13% — or whatever abysmal approval rating the institution has,” he said. “It’s deserved.””

And yet, as he relayed his myriad frustrations, Olszewski knew he would be running again. In fact, he had just filed for reelection.

“I believe nothing is beyond redemption,” he said. “I don’t think people are beyond redemption. I don’t think this institution is beyond redemption, because, at the end of the day, the institution is a reflection of the people.”

In offices throughout Capitol Hill, freshman lawmakers offered similar refrains. And as new members look on at the senior lawmakers sprinting from Capitol Hill, they sympathize.

Many lawmakers have decided that the legislative branch is beyond repair. Republican Rep. Andy Biggs, who is running for governor of Arizona, told NOTUS that Congress is “irredeemable.” Rep. Victoria Spartz, who has threatened to quit Congress, told NOTUS the House has “a lot of perverse incentives for people to govern and do politics.” Rep. Michael McCaul, who is retiring, described “partisanship, rancor, vitriolic debate, demonizing the other side of the aisle” as a motivator for his exit.

But unlike the senior members who have been beaten down by those realities, the freshmen have chosen to jump into Congress — and stick around to repair it.

“Everyone hates Congress,” Rep. Suhas Subramanyam of Virginia told NOTUS, “and people feel the same frustration I feel about the institution. But it’s also an opportunity right now to fix something that’s clearly broken.”

But this year’s momentous fights over the speakership, Medicaid, the bounds of executive authority, government funding and the release of the so-called Epstein files have tested even the most patient and optimistic lawmaker’s fortitude — especially given Republicans’ narrow majorities in the House and the Senate.

“Things are slower,” Republican Rep. Julie Fedorchak told NOTUS. “This is a numbers game, and I knew that coming in. But it just becomes more real when you’re super excited about policy ideas, and you think that they make so much sense that it’s just gonna, ‘Everybody should agree with this.’ And then you get to the like, ‘Oh, I gotta get 218,’ and it’s a lot harder than you thought.”

Five freshmen who spoke to NOTUS offered the same solution to make Congress a healthier place to work: prioritizing making relationships over making news.

Part of accomplishing that goal — both Republicans and Democrats say — will involve lawmakers getting to know members across the aisle. But doing so while balancing a commute between Washington and their districts requires extra effort.

Rep. Emily Randall, of Washington state, signed up for a fact-finding trip to Alaska with other members so she could spend time with her colleagues on the Natural Resources Committee.

“I wanted to have meals outside of C-SPAN cameras and get to know them,” Randall said. “And I’m really, really glad I went. We had some interesting policy discussions, but for the most part, it was about, like, getting to know about people’s families and, like, what inspired them to run in the first place. And how, if they’ve ever been fishing, and you know how they think about, like, our role alongside salmon in the world in like, a very touchy-feely way.”

Olszewski said one Monday Night Football pizza party with Republican Rep. Jeff Hurd and other freshmen served a similar purpose for him. Fedorchak brought up the bipartisan softball game as “probably the greatest tool I had to get to know members from the other party.”

“With our freshman class, you get a lot of people who are not looking to get in the news for the sake of getting in the news, not looking to stir up unnecessary issues or trouble. You get a lot of people who are looking to push the country in the right direction,” Rep. Brandon Gill, the freshman class president, told NOTUS.

“The more we get members who are willing to do that and ready to do the hard work, the faster we’re going to move the country in the right direction,” he said.

But there are, of course, fundamental challenges with the premise that members of Congress can keep their heads down and form collegial relationships. Gill — a staunch conservative — hasn’t been immune to attention-grabbing, provocative tactics. In February, he sent out a fundraising email that included a petition to “arrest and deport” progressive Rep. Ilhan Omar. He led the charge to add President Donald Trump’s face to the $100 bill. And he regularly appears on conservative media outlets.

And yet, even Gill professed a desire to get back to a Congress that rewards workhorses over partisan showhorses.

“I’m not willing to give up on the promise of our democracy and on our government,” Randall said. “I’m like, sort of a natural optimist. But I guess I believe in, like, the institution less than like, the power of people to build something good. I also believe in the power of people to like, do terrible things. But you know that there are enough people here who, I believe, believe that they are here for the right reasons.”

At least, for some members, complaining about the bleak reality of Capitol Hill is a first step toward healing.

“Has it gotten better since I got here? Probably not, but certainly we’re at least bringing awareness to how it’s dysfunctional,” Subramanyam said, “and hopefully we’ll start to make incremental changes in the right direction.”

As Fedorchak told NOTUS, “What’s the alternative, throw your hands up? Walk away?”",https://static.notus.org/dims4/default/18ddafc/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7868x4426+0+410/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk2-prod-aji.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fc7%2Fc7%2F183e5a724ac68bc0c389c60d7a1c%2Fap25287703225486.jpg,N,,2025-12-29 06:13:22.028863

In a world where technical competence is becoming a strategic weapon, knowledge will be the new fuel of economic independence.
Without a doubt, the battle for critical minerals is, in reality, a battle for the future.","The world is undergoing a tectonic shift in the economic and geopolitical balance, driven by a new global competition: access to critical minerals and rare earths – essential components for electric vehicle batteries, artificial intelligence chips, wind turbines, smartphones, drones and cutting-edge military technologies.

A world on the brink of a new race for resources

If oil was the fuel of the 20th century, lithium, cobalt, nickel, gallium, neodymium, and dysprosium are the ‘technological gold’ of the 21st century. Every gram of scarce material today equals a strategic advantage in the economy of the future.

Until recently, China controlled almost 90% of the world’s rare earths production and refining and has been accused of using this monopoly as a tool to pressure in trade negotiations with the West. The response was not long in coming: The United States and its allies have embarked on an economic offensive to break dependence on supply chains controlled by China.

The US and the new architecture of mineral alliances

After returning to the White House, President Donald Trump repositioned the issue of critical resources as an economic security priority. In just a few months, Washington has signed a series of strategic agreements aimed at diversifying its supply sources.

The US-Japan agreement, signed in Tokyo, establishes a framework for cooperation in the exploitation and processing of rare minerals essential to the high-tech and automotive industries. The aim is to protect supply chains and support joint investments in extraction and refining.

The US-Malaysia partnership, signed in Kuala Lumpur, guarantees Americans access to more than 16 million tons of Malaysian reserves. In return, Washington reduced customs tariffs and provided technological support for the development of local industry. Moreover, the US-Thailand protocol, a preliminary agreement, opens up a new area of cooperation for rare minerals in Southeast Asia.

The US administration did not stop at diplomacy, so Washington invested directly in mining companies in Canada and Australia (Lithium Americas, Trilogy Metals, Lynas), launched a strategic mineral reserve, and set a guaranteed minimum price for rare earths to reduce vulnerability to market fluctuations. In parallel, it relaxed environmental regulations to speed up the construction of mines and processing plants.

In just one year, the value of shares in US mining companies has doubled, a sign that the market is anticipating fierce competition and a resurgence of the Western extractive industry.

China strikes back: New export restrictions on sensitive technologies and materials

Beijing, feeling pressure to reorganize global supply chains, has introduced new restrictions on the export of sensitive technologies and materials. In July 2025, the Chinese government imposed special authorization for the export of magnets containing even trace amounts of rare earths. Five other strategic items have recently been added to the export control list. With these decisions, China is sending a clear message: “Without our resources, your technological progress will slow down.”

This strategy is not new, because in 2010 Beijing reduced exports to Japan following a maritime conflict, causing an industrial crisis. Today, however, the context is much more complex. Western countries try to develop alternatives, and the ‘geography of resources’ becomes a new map of global power.

A world divided into spheres of influence

Tensions between the US and China over access to raw materials risk fragmenting the global economy into two distinct blocs.

On the one side we have the Western Bloc (US, EU, Japan, Australia, Australia, Canada, South Korea) – based on joint investments, diversification, sustainability and partnerships with emerging economies, and on the other side the Euro-Asian Bloc (China, Russia, Iran, some African and Latin American countries) – focused on resource control and politically conditioned exports. This competition is reshaping trade routes and international alliances.

Amid conflicts and sanctions, Russia has repositioned itself as an alternative supplier of uranium and heavy metals, earning more than USD 1.2 billion from exports to the US in 2025. At the same time, Africa – from the Democratic Republic of Congo to Namibia – is becoming the terrain of the new ‘cobalt rush’, where Chinese, American and European investment intersects with local interests and geopolitical tensions.

So, it is no exaggeration to say that critical minerals have become a new strategic weapon, as important as technology or weapons.

Direct link to new industries: AI, automotive and IT

At the heart of this dispute is the revolution in artificial intelligence and emerging technologies. Every AI server, every high-performance processor, every electric car battery consumes impressive amounts of lithium, cobalt, graphite, gallium and neodymium. For example, a single electric car can require over 30 kg of rare earths, and a state-of-the-art AI data centre consumes critical materials equivalent to the output of a small mine!

Thus, the industry of the future is trapped by the resources of the present. Amid these tensions, global investors are reacting with caution. The volatility in US stock markets, recently reported by XTB Romania, reflects concerns that a protracted trade conflict could derail global economic growth and add to inflationary pressures. But behind all this friction, a clear reality is emerging; critical minerals are the key to the global energy and technology transition.

Romania and the expertise of the University of Petrosani – potential in a new global context

In this new economic order, Romania has significant strengths, but they are still insufficiently exploited. Romania has important mineral resources (copper, graphite, wolfram, molybdenum, lithium) and a solid university infrastructure in geology, mining and natural resources engineering.

A prime example is the University of Petrosani, an institution with over 75 years of tradition in training specialists in mining, energy, and geotechnics.

“At a time when the world is facing an urgent need for engineers, geologists and specialists in mining economics, graduates from Petrosani can play a strategic role. They can contribute not only to the reindustrialization of Romania, but also to the integration of the country in the European value chains for critical resources, promoted by the European Union through the European Critical Raw Materials Act,” says the Rector of the University of Petrosani Sorin Mihai Radu.

Amid geopolitical pressures and the need for energy autonomy, Europe is looking for domestic sources and local expertise. Romania, with its mining tradition and top technical schools, has the potential to become a regional centre of expertise in exploration, recovery and recycling of critical materials. From developing new clean extraction technologies, to research into the recovery of mining waste and training a new generation of engineers for the energy and IT industries, the potential is huge.

A delicate balance between resources, technology and power

At the moment, the critical resource crisis is not just an economic competition, but also a test of global vision and responsibility. In the years to come, the power of states will no longer be measured by GDP or military arsenal alone, but by their ability to ensure a steady flow of raw materials for the technologies of the future.

In this context, Romania must look to the future with clear-sightedness and ambition. The country has resources, industrial tradition and capable people. A coherent strategy sustained investment and an overall vision linking education, research and industry are still missing.

The University of Petrosani, through its specialists and graduates, can be one of the pillars of this reconstruction. In a world where technical competence is becoming a strategic weapon, knowledge will be the new fuel of economic independence.

Without a doubt, the battle for critical minerals is, in reality, a battle for the future. Whoever controls the resources controls the technology. And whoever controls the technology controls the world.

Romania should not be a mere spectator, as with intelligence, vision and investment in education it can become an active part of this new global order. Will it succeed?",https://energyindustryreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/european-battery-alliance-1.jpg,N,,2025-12-29 07:12:43.731344

The Trump administration, as expected, reversed a whole suite of federal policies that promoted or encouraged EVs.

California's ability to require the sale of EVs: gone. Federal rules about emissions and fuel economy — being rewritten. Federal penalties for car companies that sell too many gas guzzlers: zeroed out. The $7,500 federal tax credit? Kaput.

Meanwhile, automakers delayed or canceled a host of unprofitable EV plans.

The all-electric Ram 1500 REV was canceled before a single one was built. The all-electric Ford Lightning was discontinued despite some glowing reviews. (Both pickups will be replaced with extended-range electric vehicles, which come with both a big battery and a backup gas tank.)

The buzzy Volkswagen Buzz is still available in other countries, but no longer in the U.S. The GM Brightdrop van is no more. The list goes on.

As for sales? ""It's a roller-coaster ride,"" says Stephanie Valdez Streaty, who monitors EVs for the data and services company Cox Automotive.

Sales spiked in August and September, during the last weeks that the federal tax credit was available, as buyers rushed to take advantage of the expiring opportunity. Cox estimated EVs hit an all-time high of 11.6% of the new vehicle market in September. Then sales crashed by 50% in October.

But here's a twist.

""Among U.S. shoppers who are in [the] market for new vehicles, the interest in electric vehicles actually ticked up a bit after the tax credit went away,"" says Brent Gruber, who runs the EV practice at consumer insights company J.D. Power.

It's the EV story you might not have heard this year: Despite the political and product planning whiplash, consumer appetite for EVs has been on a very smooth ride.

Overall, about 25% of new car shoppers are very interested in buying an EV, according to J.D. Power surveys. And with minor fluctuations, ""it's held pretty consistent,"" Gruber says, despite what he calls the ""turbulence"" of this year.

""There's still a tremendous amount of interest,"" he says. ""And from an EV owner perspective, we continue to see high levels of satisfaction once people do get into those products."" In fact, EV owners are 94% likely to repurchase another EV for their next vehicle, he says.

BJ Birtwell runs the Electrify Expo, a traveling festival dedicated to EVs. He says EVs have suffered from being politicized, with a lot of right-of-center Americans rejecting them out of hand.

""There's still a cloud of skepticism around EVs across some parts of the country,"" he says. But put a skeptic behind the wheel of a new EV, he says, ""and I'll tell you what I see: Smiles for miles."" Test drives reveal the cars are fun to drive, he says, and a little research can show that charging at home is easier and cheaper than they thought.

An American slowdown

Still, while Americans remain interested in EVs, it's undeniable that battery-powered vehicles are taking off more slowly than industry execs expected a few years ago. That's not just because of the policy reversal; it's also because of market realities. For example, while charging might be easy at home, it's a hassle for apartment dwellers who don't have that option. Meanwhile, vehicle prices — a challenge for the entire auto market — are even higher for EVs. Lower fuel and maintenance costs can't always overcome that up-front sticker shock, even for people who are hypothetically interested in buying.

This slowdown will have global consequences for the environment and for human beings: It locks in higher carbon emissions and air pollution for years to come.

The legacy automakers, of course, have lost billions of dollars on the EV designs they've canceled or postponed. But the delay hurts more than just the big-name auto brands. A whole network of suppliers sell parts to the automakers, and they also bear the burden when plans change.

Ken O'Trakoun of RPM Partners works with auto suppliers in distress. ""The whiplash,"" he says, ""between demand going up and demand receding, it has impacted a number of suppliers."" They made investments in factories to supply automakers for vehicles that either aren't being made, or are being made at much lower volumes. ""It's pretty disruptive.""

The ""ripple effect"" from those suppliers ""creates impacts on jobs,"" Valdez-Streaty notes.

Automakers, too, have laid off or reassigned employees away from battery plants and EV production lines as part of their adjusted timelines.

A clear global trend

But while automakers are slowing their EV plans down significantly, they're not giving up on them, either.

Partly that's because of the enduring consumer interest; as long as there's a market, the automakers want to serve it. And partly that's because the automakers are all global companies. They want to be able to sell to the rest of the world, too.

""On a global scale, internal combustion engine cars already peaked back, like, eight or nine years ago,"" says Huiling Zhou, U.S. EV analyst for the research group BloombergNEF.

About one in four cars sold worldwide this year was electric, Zhou says — driven by China's remarkably fast embrace of those vehicles. And China, increasingly, is exporting cars around the world.

That means that the global market for cars that run on gas or diesel is shrinking, while the market for battery-powered cars is expanding — and China is dominating it.

If automakers want to compete around the world, they simply can't afford to get off the EV roller coaster.

(Both pickups will be replaced with extended-range electric vehicles, which come with both a big battery and a backup gas tank.)
Cox estimated EVs hit an all-time high of 11.6% of the new vehicle market in September.
About one in four cars sold worldwide this year was electric, Zhou says — driven by China's remarkably fast embrace of those vehicles.
That means that the global market for cars that run on gas or diesel is shrinking, while the market for battery-powered cars is expanding — and China is dominating it.","The electric vehicle industry has taken a pummeling this year. The Trump administration, as expected, reversed a whole suite of federal policies that promoted or encouraged EVs.

California's ability to require the sale of EVs: gone. Federal rules about emissions and fuel economy — being rewritten. Federal penalties for car companies that sell too many gas guzzlers: zeroed out. The $7,500 federal tax credit? Kaput.

Meanwhile, automakers delayed or canceled a host of unprofitable EV plans.

The all-electric Ram 1500 REV was canceled before a single one was built. The all-electric Ford Lightning was discontinued despite some glowing reviews. (Both pickups will be replaced with extended-range electric vehicles, which come with both a big battery and a backup gas tank.)

The buzzy Volkswagen Buzz is still available in other countries, but no longer in the U.S. The GM Brightdrop van is no more. The list goes on.

As for sales? ""It's a roller-coaster ride,"" says Stephanie Valdez Streaty, who monitors EVs for the data and services company Cox Automotive.

Sales spiked in August and September, during the last weeks that the federal tax credit was available, as buyers rushed to take advantage of the expiring opportunity. Cox estimated EVs hit an all-time high of 11.6% of the new vehicle market in September. Then sales crashed by 50% in October.

But here's a twist.

""Among U.S. shoppers who are in [the] market for new vehicles, the interest in electric vehicles actually ticked up a bit after the tax credit went away,"" says Brent Gruber, who runs the EV practice at consumer insights company J.D. Power.

It's the EV story you might not have heard this year: Despite the political and product planning whiplash, consumer appetite for EVs has been on a very smooth ride.

Overall, about 25% of new car shoppers are very interested in buying an EV, according to J.D. Power surveys. And with minor fluctuations, ""it's held pretty consistent,"" Gruber says, despite what he calls the ""turbulence"" of this year.

""There's still a tremendous amount of interest,"" he says. ""And from an EV owner perspective, we continue to see high levels of satisfaction once people do get into those products."" In fact, EV owners are 94% likely to repurchase another EV for their next vehicle, he says.

BJ Birtwell runs the Electrify Expo, a traveling festival dedicated to EVs. He says EVs have suffered from being politicized, with a lot of right-of-center Americans rejecting them out of hand.

""There's still a cloud of skepticism around EVs across some parts of the country,"" he says. But put a skeptic behind the wheel of a new EV, he says, ""and I'll tell you what I see: Smiles for miles."" Test drives reveal the cars are fun to drive, he says, and a little research can show that charging at home is easier and cheaper than they thought.

An American slowdown

Still, while Americans remain interested in EVs, it's undeniable that battery-powered vehicles are taking off more slowly than industry execs expected a few years ago. That's not just because of the policy reversal; it's also because of market realities. For example, while charging might be easy at home, it's a hassle for apartment dwellers who don't have that option. Meanwhile, vehicle prices — a challenge for the entire auto market — are even higher for EVs. Lower fuel and maintenance costs can't always overcome that up-front sticker shock, even for people who are hypothetically interested in buying.

This slowdown will have global consequences for the environment and for human beings: It locks in higher carbon emissions and air pollution for years to come.

The legacy automakers, of course, have lost billions of dollars on the EV designs they've canceled or postponed. But the delay hurts more than just the big-name auto brands. A whole network of suppliers sell parts to the automakers, and they also bear the burden when plans change.

Ken O'Trakoun of RPM Partners works with auto suppliers in distress. ""The whiplash,"" he says, ""between demand going up and demand receding, it has impacted a number of suppliers."" They made investments in factories to supply automakers for vehicles that either aren't being made, or are being made at much lower volumes. ""It's pretty disruptive.""

The ""ripple effect"" from those suppliers ""creates impacts on jobs,"" Valdez-Streaty notes.

Automakers, too, have laid off or reassigned employees away from battery plants and EV production lines as part of their adjusted timelines.

A clear global trend

But while automakers are slowing their EV plans down significantly, they're not giving up on them, either.

Partly that's because of the enduring consumer interest; as long as there's a market, the automakers want to serve it. And partly that's because the automakers are all global companies. They want to be able to sell to the rest of the world, too.

""On a global scale, internal combustion engine cars already peaked back, like, eight or nine years ago,"" says Huiling Zhou, U.S. EV analyst for the research group BloombergNEF.

About one in four cars sold worldwide this year was electric, Zhou says — driven by China's remarkably fast embrace of those vehicles. And China, increasingly, is exporting cars around the world.

That means that the global market for cars that run on gas or diesel is shrinking, while the market for battery-powered cars is expanding — and China is dominating it.

If automakers want to compete around the world, they simply can't afford to get off the EV roller coaster.

Some companies are still announcing new projects, but lost investments are now outpacing them by three to one. “The scale of cancellations shows how fragile this moment is for America’s clean energy economy,” says Michael Timberlake, director of research at E2.

The list includes a new $4.3 billion General Motors EV plant in Michigan that’s being retooled to make gas-powered vehicles, a $3.2 billion Stellantis battery factory in Illinois that was cancelled, and a $2.6 billion battery factory in Georgia that was scrapped by a Norway-based manufacturer, among dozens of other projects. The majority of the cancelled projects are factories, not clean energy generation plants, though some solar or wind farms may not show up on the list because their cancellations are harder to track. (Though there is some evidence the administration is changing its mind about batteries, specifically.)

The cuts add up to nearly 40,000 lost jobs, according to E2. Republican congressional districts lost the most large-scale projects, 37 in total.

What’s harder to track than cancellations is how many projects might have been announced under different political conditions that now won’t ever break ground. Up until the 2024 election, Timberlake says monthly announcements consistently exceeded $1 billion in investment. Last month, that total was $550 million—less than the value of the cancelled battery project.

“We’ll never recover those jobs and those investments that were going to be announced in 2025 under a different political environment,” says Timberlake. “And that’s going to add up over time to a significant loss in step with the rest of the world. We’ve now lost a lot of what could have been, and it’s going to be hard to ever get that back.”","https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024/wp-cms-2/2025/12/p-1-91465818-clean-energy-projects-scrapped.jpg",N,,2025-12-29 05:13:15.117345

The rise of AI is driving explosive growth in data centers, with traditional energy sources increasingly falling short.","A Texas-based energy company has come up with a striking proposal to meet the rapidly growing power consumption of AI data centers. The company wants to give decommissioned nuclear reactors from the US Navy a second life as an energy source for large-scale AI infrastructure.

As reported by SiliconANGLE , the plan comes from HGP Intelligent Energy, which is seeking financial support from the US Department of Energy through a loan guarantee. With this support, the company wants to launch a project aimed at providing continuous, sustainable power to data centers running heavy AI workloads.

This involves two nuclear reactors that previously served on US Navy aircraft carriers and submarines. These reactors would be installed at a special data center campus near Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, a location with a long history in nuclear research and technology.

The reactors HGP is targeting are known as pressurized water reactors, a type that has been reliably used by the Navy for decades. They are designed for long-term use and are known for their robust safety profile. According to the plans, together they would be able to supply between 450 and 520 megawatts of constant power, enough to support energy-intensive AI training and inference without interruptions.

Cheaper than new nuclear reactors

The total investment is estimated at $1.8 to $2.1 billion. Converted per megawatt, that would be significantly cheaper than building a new nuclear power plant or even a modern small modular reactor. It is precisely this cost advantage that makes the idea interesting for parties struggling with the rapidly increasing energy demand of hyperscale data centers.

Technically speaking, reusing these reactors does not seem to be an insurmountable problem. The biggest challenge lies in the regulations. Nuclear installations for military use fall outside the existing frameworks for civilian energy production. Moreover, the reactors are sealed and use highly enriched fuel, which does not comply with the current licensing procedures for commercial nuclear power plants in the United States.

Nevertheless, HGP is convinced that these obstacles can be overcome. The company argues that the necessary knowledge is already available and that it is working with investors and partners who have confidence in the safe and scalable implementation of the plan.

The proposal highlights the increasing pressure on the US power grid. The rise of AI is driving explosive growth in data centers, with traditional energy sources increasingly falling short. Large cloud and infrastructure companies are therefore looking to nuclear energy as a stable and emission-free solution, ranging from existing power plants to new reactor concepts and long-term power purchase agreements.",https://www.techzine.eu/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Datacenter-op-kernenergie.png,N,,2025-12-29 04:13:16.240703

During a year full of headline-grabbing destruction of U.S. clean energy policy, renewables still led the way.
The most important thing we saw this year is that Trump simply can’t stop the energy transition.
To be specific: Electricity demand is growing quickly in the U.S., and clean energy is the least expensive and most readily available way to keep pace.
The Trump administration would certainly prefer to meet rising demand with coal and gas, but in many cases it’s simply impractical.","Five and a half months. That’s all the time Donald Trump needed to crush the only major climate law the United States ever managed to pass. It was swift work, using a sledgehammer and not a scalpel, and now the energy transition will have to make do with the fragments of the law that remain.

The words bleak and dispiriting come to mind. How else to describe the fact that the U.S. entered the year implementing an ambitious if inadequate decarbonization law, and is now exiting 2025 with that law all but repealed?

But there were also some reasons to be hopeful about the energy transition this year — if you knew where to look.

Let’s start with the numbers. During a year full of headline-grabbing destruction of U.S. clean energy policy, renewables still led the way. Through November, a whopping 92% of all new electricity capacity built in the U.S. came in the form of solar, batteries, and wind power. Electric vehicle sales hit a record, too — nearly 440,000 in the third quarter of the year — though the surge was driven in large part by consumers rushing to buy EVs before the disappearance of a federal tax credit axed by Trump.

There were also intriguing moments of alignment between Trump’s ​“energy dominance” agenda and the transition away from fossil fuels. Geothermal and nuclear are two sources of carbon-free energy that the administration has, for whatever reasons, deemed desirable. So while the One Big Beautiful Bill Act eviscerated much of President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act, it spared tax credits for geothermal systems. And Trump has not only preserved Biden-era funding for nuclear projects but expanded it — possibly by orders of magnitude if an $80 billion plan for partially state-owned nuclear reactors actually happens.

The most important thing we saw this year is that Trump simply can’t stop the energy transition. Sure, he can slow it. He already has. But try as the administration might, there are forces at play bigger and more stubborn even than politics.

To be specific: Electricity demand is growing quickly in the U.S., and clean energy is the least expensive and most readily available way to keep pace.

The Trump administration would certainly prefer to meet rising demand with coal and gas, but in many cases it’s simply impractical.

Coal is increasingly the most expensive form of electricity. Gas, for better or for worse, certainly will help meet some of this new demand — but it faces very real supply-chain constraints. Gas turbines are sold out among major manufacturers, with wait times stretching as long as seven years.

When the country is clamoring for more electrons and voters are increasingly upset about rising power bills, and the only thing that can be built quickly is solar and storage, renewables will simply have to be built. (They’ll just cost more than they would have without Trump.)

So while it hasn’t been a good year for clean energy in the U.S., the transition now has enough momentum that even a terrible year amounts to more of a slowdown than a derailment. It’s a matter of inertia.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/GettyImages-2223602335.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=fd27af1ba68e7d0733eac7739d10114c,N,,2025-12-29 04:13:25.676763

It seemed as if every week brought a new, higher forecast of just how much electricity the data centers that run AI models will need. Amid the deluge of discussion, an urgent question arose again and again: How can we prevent the computing boom from hurting consumers and the planet?

We’re not bidding 2025 farewell with a concrete answer, but we’re certainly closer to one than we were when the year started.

To catch you up: Tech giants are constructing a fleet of energy-gobbling data centers in a bid to expand AI and other computing tools. The build-out is encouraging U.S. utilities to invest beaucoup bucks in fossil-fueled power plants and has already raised household electricity bills in some regions. Complicating things further is that many of today’s proposed data centers may never get built, which would leave the rest of us to foot the bill for expensive and unnecessary power plants that bake the planet.

It’s all hands on deck to find solutions. Lawmakers across every state considered a total of 238 bills related to data centers in 2025 — and a whopping half of that legislation was dedicated to addressing energy concerns, according to government relations firm MultiState.

Meanwhile, the people who operate and regulate our electric grid worked on rules to get data centers online fast without breaking the system. One idea in particular gained traction: Let the facilities connect only if they agree to pull less power from the grid during times of über-high demand. That could entail literally computing less, or outfitting data centers with on-site generators or batteries that kick in during these moments.

Even the Trump administration got in on the action, with Energy Secretary Chris Wright directing federal regulators in October to come up with rules that would let data centers connect to the grid sooner if they agree to be flexible in their power use. But this idea of ​“load flexibility” is still largely untested and has its skeptics, who argue that it’s technically unrealistic under current energy-market frameworks.

And then there are the hyperscalers themselves. Big tech companies with ambitious climate goals are signing power purchase agreements left and right for energy sources from geothermal to nuclear to hydropower. Google unveiled deals with two utilities this summer to dial down data centers’ power use during high demand. Texas-based developer Aligned Data Centers announced this fall that it would pay for a big battery alongside a computing facility it’s building in the Pacific Northwest, allowing the servers to get up and running way faster than if the company waited for traditional utility upgrades.

Expect more action on this front in 2026. Local opposition to data centers is on the rise, power-demand projections are still climbing, and speculation is mounting that the entire AI sector fueling those forecasts is a big old bubble about to pop.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/GettyImages-2249021916.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=c2f1d0c8f45af85f861caec846786962,N,,2025-12-29 04:13:30.385681

Climate coverage endures Despite the downturn, climate journalism has come a long way over the last few decades.
Back then, any story about climate change required both scientific voices and climate change deniers in the name of 'both-sidesism.'","Some 89% of people worldwide say they want more action on the climate crisis. Nearly seven in 10 note they would donate 1% of their income to help. In the US, two-thirds are at least somewhat worried about global warming.

And yet, Americans hear remarkably little about a crisis reshaping the global economy, displacing populations, worsening extreme weather, and affecting nearly every facet of daily life. More than half say they receive news about climate change several times a year or less, according to a 2025 Yale Program on Climate Change Communication report.

""If the media's not reporting the issue of climate change, it's out of sight and out of mind for people,"" said Anthony Leiserowitz, director of the Yale program.

The problem has become even more acute at a time when the US president is openly hostile to the scientific consensus on climate change. Donald Trump and his allies have pushed misleading narratives about the trade-offs of green energy, drawing reporters into covering false controversies instead of facts and making the job of reporting harder.

""The Trump administration is playing reporters like a fiddle on the issue of trade-offs"" by bringing up red herrings and sending reporters down rabbit holes, Jael Holzman, a climate reporter at Heatmap News, told DW.

Trump administration spreading clean energy disinformation

Among President Trump's misleading claims is that offshore wind projects are ""driving the whales crazy"" and are the hidden cause of the marine mammals washing up dead.

Scientists, however, say there is no known link between the two, noting that vessel strikes and fishing-gear entanglements are the primary causes. Nonetheless, numerous stories still give airtime to unsubstantiated concerns from politicians and community groups, understandably worried about whales.

A similar dynamic emerged after the major fire at California's Moss Landing battery facility when Lee Zeldin, administrator of the EPA, the federal agency tasked with protecting the environment, visited Long Island to criticize New York's push for battery storage infrastructure.

But remarks by Trump-appointee Zeldin, and much of the subsequent reporting, omitted context that the incident likely stemmed from outdated technology, not representative of much of the country's newer battery-storage facilities.

""The impact of the Trump administration on the coverage is intentional,"" said Holzman, adding that tactics to delay progress on climate change have overtaken outright denialism.

""They don't need everyone to deny the existence of climate change — they just need enough people to deny the importance of dealing with it now.""

Scientific data missing, no longer updated

Beyond spreading misleading claims, the administration has made it harder for reporters to access the data needed to provide accurate context in the first place.

Holzman described how a government dashboard she used to track progress on environmental regulations mysteriously went dark for more than a month.

""There's just a lot of unexpected chicanery and shenanigans,"" she said.

The team behind climate.gov, a popular federal clearinghouse for climate information about weather, sea level and temperature rise, was fired this summer and users were redirected to a new site, which is no longer being updated. The previous team has since been attempting to relaunch the site.

The EPA has also erased references to human activity being the main driver of climate change, instead focusing on ""natural processes"" such as volcanic eruptions and variations in solar activity.

""Climate change has been scrubbed from government websites, they've taken down a number of major data sets, they are killing off programs at NASA that are devoted to climate change,"" said Leiserowitz at Yale, referencing the Orbiting Carbon Observatories, a pair of NASA missions that monitor greenhouse gas emissions, and which the administration wants to cancel.

""The US has been a major source of climate information, climate modeling, and so on, and that is having a chilling effect,"" he added.

Why climate coverage is shrinking

Still, Trump's return to office is not the only reason for a global dip in climate news coverage. It was on a steady-if-rocky incline throughout the 21st century before peaking in 2021 around the time the Biden administration was debating its landmark climate law.

But coverage fell precipitously the next year and has continued to slide downward, according to the Media and Climate Change Observatory, which monitors mentions of the issue in five major American newspapers, seven television stations, two radio networks and two wire services.

Several reasons are at play. Traditional media outlets have been in long-term decline over the last two decades, consistently losing money and readers. Since 2005, close to 3,500 local newspapers have vanished, according to a Northwestern University study.

Corporate consolidation and evaporating ad revenue have forced tighter budgets and repeated layoffs, squeezing coverage of complex beats like science and climate.

In 2023, CNBC laid off Cat Clifford, who helped found the network's climate desk and wrote that other layoffs had left it ""fundamentally dismantled"" with no dedicated staff covering the issue.

And even when the media does cover climate change, stories must navigate an algorithm-driven information ecosystem that filters news through partisan biases and amplifies disinformation before it ever reaches readers.

That ecosystem rewards Trump's stream of provocative statements — what reporters call a ""fire hose of attention"" strategy — frequently drowning out climate coverage.

Climate change is competing with ""news and entertainment and sports and your kid saying they want ice cream, and everything else going on in our lives that's demanding our attention,"" said Leiserowitz.

Climate coverage endures

Despite the downturn, climate journalism has come a long way over the last few decades.

Sadie Babits remembers the early years of climate journalism well. She filed her first environmental story in 2000 as an intern at Boise State Public Radio, reporting on Montana wildfires when the science linking extreme weather to human activity was still emerging. Back then, any story about climate change required both scientific voices and climate change deniers in the name of 'both-sidesism.'

Today, Babits is the senior supervising climate editor at NPR — a position that did not exist at the start of her career — joining legacy outlets like ​The New York Times, ​​The Washington Post and ​The Associated Press in building and maintaining dedicated climate desks. New niche outlets such as Holzman's ​Heatmap News, Canary Media, ​Latitude Media, ​​The Cool Down and more have sprouted up in the last five years.

""If people weren't interested in these topics, then I wouldn't have a job,"" Holzman said. ""I have readers so religiously interested in every word that I write that I have fans that come up to me in bars.""

Even in a year when Congress cut all federal support for NPR over accusations of liberal bias, Babits said the outlet has not changed its approach.

""We see this as a critical story of our time,"" she said. ""We have not backed down from the kind of work that we would be doing in any other year.""

At recent United Nations climate talks, South Korea’s new Ministry of Climate, Energy and Environment announced plans to retire most of the country’s coal-fired power plants by 2040 and to at least halve its carbon emissions by 2035.

Experts say this shows that South Korea, a major coal importer with one of the world’s largest fleets of coal plants, wants to speed up its renewable energy transition, which lags behind its neighbors and global averages.

But as part of trade deals with President Donald Trump, Seoul is raising imports of U.S. liquefied natural gas, or LNG. Climate activists contend such plans may conflict with the country’s pledges to help curb climate change and could lock South Korea into a fossil fuel-dependent future.

Talks are underway for South Korea to invest $350 billion in U.S. projects and purchase up to $100 billion worth of U.S. energy products, including LNG, a natural gas cooled to liquid form for easy storage and travel. It burns cleaner than coal, but still causes planet-warming emissions, especially of methane.

South Korea’s overall LNG imports may not increase if it offsets purchases of more U.S. natural gas by reducing imports from other sources such as Australia and the Middle East.

Still, it’s unclear how South Korea will “manage and consolidate all this somehow contradictory planning regarding its energy sector,” said Michelle Kim, an energy specialist for the U.S.-based Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.

Power transition sparks

climate goals

South Korea’s liberal President Lee Jae Myung, who won a snap election in June, campaigned for stronger climate commitments. They had softened under his conservative predecessor Yoon Suk Yeol, who was ousted after a short-lived martial law declaration.

“As the global temperature rises, we all need to responsibly take climate action and Korea will have a stronger sense of responsibility in tackling the climate crisis,” Kim Sung-hwan, the inaugural Minister of Climate, Energy and Environment, said in an interview with The Associated Press.

South Korea’s goal to cut carbon emissions by 53% to 61% of its 2018 level, fell short of climate activists’ expectations. Business lobbies representing major manufacturers had proposed a 48% emissions reduction target.

“This range presents an effort by the government to accommodate two very different ways of thinking about the economic and climate future of the nation,” said Joojin Kim of the Seoul-based advocacy group, Solutions for Our Climate.

South Korea faces climate dilemma over U.S. deal

The South Korean government made the ambitious commitment to increase its clean energy use even after Trump’s sweeping ‘America First’ tariffs spurred energy negotiations between Seoul and Washington.

As part of its broader efforts to avoid higher tariffs, South Korea offered to import more LNG from the U.S., but the final trade deal has not been announced.

The agreement still under negotiation could last between three to 10 years, according to industry analysis and U.S. federal documents. Depending on the deal’s duration, South Korea may import between 3 million to 9 million tons of American LNG a year.

LNG made up almost a fifth of South Korea’s total energy supply last year, according to the International Energy Agency, or IEA. The government’s target was to cut that to 10.6% by 2038.

South Korea risks its climate goals if the pending trade deal increases the total volume of imported LNG, which will likely lead to an oversupply issue and the excess burning of gas to justify the deal, said Insung Lee, with Greenpeace in Seoul.

“If we just replace coal plants with LNG, that means the coal exit actually doesn’t lead to a green transition and merely shifts Korea’s addiction from coal to gas, which undermines the whole spirit of climate action,” Lee said.

South Korea’s energy mix

Renewable energy generated 7% of South Korea’s domestic power in 2022, according to the IEA. South Korean government data show that had increased to 10.5% last year, still one of the lowest levels among leading economies.

Japan, with an economy more than twice as big, generates 21% of its power from renewable sources. Spain, whose economy is about the same size as South Korea’s, gets 42% of its power from renewable sources.

Clean energy provided about 30% of global electricity production in 2023.

Nuclear power produces a major share of South Korea’s domestic energy, with government data showing that nuclear sources accounted for 31% of total electricity generation last year.

“We will transition into a new energy system that focuses on renewables and nuclear, while phasing out coal,” said Kim, the energy minister. He said South Korea will use LNG as a “complementary or emergency energy source” to make up for irregularities in renewable energy supplies.

In early December, South Korea set another goal of boosting its offshore wind power capacity to 4 gigawatts, about 10 times the current level.

South Korean companies that don’t cut back on carbon emissions may find that to be a competitive disadvantage, said Michelle Kim of the IEEFA.

Many global industries, including shipping and aviation, face pressure to reduce their emissions by providing incentives for low emitters and creating deterrents for high ones, she said.

“This is a lot of risk,” she said. “South Korea needs to speed up renewable energy deployment and come out from high dependency on the fossil fuel industry.”

At last month’s climate talks, South Korea joined the Powering Past Coal Alliance, a group of businesses, organizations and governments promoting the green energy transition.

That’s mainly a symbolic move, said Bruce Douglas, with the Global Renewables Alliance. “But it signifies very clear government intention to move away from fossil fuels and towards clean power.”

South Korea imports virtually all its coal, largely from Australia, Indonesia and Russia, and the switch to renewables is bound to impact regional markets.

The pledge to retire 40 of South Korea’s 61 coal sites by 2040 may be “an enforced transition” for coal exporters in the Asia-Pacific region, said James Bowen, with Climate Analytics. “It’s a reality that they’re going to have to face this downturn in the market.”

“The writing’s on the wall,” Bowen said. “One of the biggest importers in the world, one of the biggest customers, is starting to move away from coal.”

The transaction was initially announced in November 2024 and is expected to be fully completed by the end of December 2025, including the transfer of all equity and assets.

Through this transaction, T1 Energy has acquired domestic manufacturing capabilities in the US, making it eligible for the 45X Production Tax Credit under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). Meanwhile, Trina Solar has repatriated funds through a ""light-asset"" model, mitigating geopolitical risks while retaining a minority stake (approximately 17.4%) in the company to maintain a strategic presence in the US market.

The 5GW module factory in Wilmer, Texas, serves as the strategic cornerstone for TrinaSolar to establish its core manufacturing capabilities in the US. Its development timeline is as follows:

According to the agreement signed at the end of 2024 and the final closing in 2025, the total transaction consideration was approximately $340 million (adjusted to about $380 million after certain adjustments), with the payment method being a combination of ""cash + debt notes + equity""：

1. Cash payment: $100 million.

2. Loan repayment: Repayment of intercompany loans of approximately $50 million.

3. Senior notes: Loan notes with a face value of $150 million.

4. Equity swap: Equity transfer conducted in two phases.

Phase 1 (end of 2024): TrinaSolar received $10 million in cash, $150 million in notes, and the first batch of T1 Energy ordinary shares (approximately 15.4 million shares).

Phase 2 (completed in December 2025): The remaining approximately 17.9 million ordinary shares were transferred.

Upon full completion of the transaction by December 2025, TrinaSolar held approximately 45.9 million shares of T1 Energy, representing a stake of about 17.4% (TrinaSolar's shareholding ratio was diluted from the initially projected 19% due to subsequent share issuance by T1 Energy).

For the seller Trina Solar, the core logic of this transaction lies in circumventing increasingly stringent trade barriers and optimizing its capital structure. In response to the escalating anti-dumping and countervailing duty investigations (AD/CVD) and tariff policies imposed by the US on Chinese PV enterprises, Trina Solar transferred assets to T1 Energy, which has European and American backgrounds. This move not only established the factory's products as ""Made in the USA"" to mitigate ownership risks but also successfully monetized the assets, recovering several hundred million US dollars in cash to significantly improve its balance sheet. More importantly, Trina Solar did not exit entirely; instead, by holding equity in T1 Energy and appointing executives such as Mingxing Lin and Dave Gustafson to T1's board and management, it maintained deep involvement and strategic influence in the US market.

For the buyer T1 Energy, the strategic motivation focused on securing policy benefits and achieving rapid business transformation. The primary driver of this acquisition was obtaining production tax credits under Section 45X of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which provides direct and substantial cash flow support. By taking over this operational high-quality asset, T1 Energy successfully overcame previous challenges in cell manufacturing, such as those faced in the Norwegian Giga Arctic project, transforming from a revenue-less cell startup into a solar manufacturer with positive cash flow. Furthermore, this factory (G1) will serve as a cornerstone, facilitating the construction of the Austin cell plant (G2) and helping T1 Energy build a complete, vertically integrated PV supply chain in the US, encompassing both modules and cells.",https://static.metal.com/common.metal.com/images/header-en/smm-logo.png,N,,2025-12-29 11:00:37.924163

U.S. Senator

Washington, D.C. – On September 19th, 1942, U.S. Army General Leslie Groves made a decision that would change the course of history. He approved the federal government’s acquisition of nearly 60,000 acres along East Tennessee’s Clinch River, establishing the central hub of the Manhattan Project.

At the site—soon known as Oak Ridge—tens of thousands of Americans worked together to pioneer uranium enrichment and plutonium production, ensuring America’s victory in the nuclear race against the Axis Powers.

Eighty-three years later, that extraordinary legacy lives on. Each day, scientists at Oak Ridge National Laboratory conduct cutting-edge nuclear research, including at the Y-12 National Security Complex, one of the original Manhattan Project facilities. More than 220 nuclear companies call Tennessee home, including 150 in the Oak Ridge area alone. Universities from Tennessee Tech to the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, lead the nation in nuclear engineering, educating the future leaders of this vital field.

As President Donald J. Trump works to usher in a “nuclear renaissance” to power 21st-century America—with the aim of quadrupling our nuclear capacity by 2050—no state is better prepared to lead than Tennessee. That leadership will prove vital to our nation’s security, safety, and prosperity.

The advantages of nuclear power are clear. Over the long term, it is the most reliable source of base load electricity, especially as emerging technologies like artificial intelligence and quantum computing require more and more energy. Nuclear plants operate 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, with remarkable efficiency. To produce the same amount of energy, solar power requires roughly 400 times as much land as nuclear, while wind requires 2,000 times as much land. Nuclear energy is also resilient, operating through natural disasters when reliable power can mean the difference between life and death.

For far too long, however, government red tape has made nuclear development unnecessarily difficult. Since the turn of the century, America has brought just three new nuclear reactors online. Over the same period, Communist China has constructed more than 50.

To make certain that the 21st century is an American century, the United States must lead in nuclear energy. That’s why, earlier this year, President Trump signed executive orders to support the industry, including to speed up approvals for new reactors and to strengthen domestic fuel supply chains.

To seize this opportunity, the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) must lead the way. President Trump has taken decisive action to put the nation’s largest public utility on the right track, including last week’s Senate confirmation of four of his nominees to the TVA Board of Directors, where they will help guide the utility’s efforts to expand nuclear energy generation.

Central to this effort will be the TVA’s development of small modular realtors, or SMRs. While building traditional reactors can be expensive and time-consuming, SMRs offer a more flexible and affordable alternative. According to one estimate, SMRs can halve the costs associated with building and operating a large nuclear plant.

Tennessee is uniquely positioned to lead this effort. The Clinch River Site is one of the only federally approved locations in the country for SMR development. Earlier this month, the U.S. Department of Energy awarded TVA a $400 million grant to advance the project. In addition, as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill, I was pleased to secure a tax benefit for certain advanced nuclear facility projects—support that will directly benefit the Clinch River Site.

Eight decades ago, Tennessee helped America win the first nuclear race. With new challenges and opportunities before us, our state must once again rise to the moment—ensuring that America remains the global leader in nuclear energy and securing our freedom, safety, and sovereignty for generations to come.",https://www.clarksvilleonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Marsha-Blackburn-2.jpg,N,,2025-12-29 01:13:16.372615

The two groups are expected soon to publish their final figures for 2025, and based on sales data so far this year, there is almost no chance the American company led by Elon Musk will retain its leadership position.

At the end of November, Shenzhen-based BYD, which also produces hybrid vehicles, had sold 2.07 million EVs so far in 2025.

Tesla, for its part, had sold 1.22 million by the end of September.

Tesla's September figures included a one-time boost in sales, to nearly half-a-million vehicles in a three-month period, before the expiration of a US tax credit for buyers of electric vehicles -- which ended under legislation backed by President Donald Trump, a climate change skeptic.

But Tesla's sales in the coming quarter are expected to fall to 449,000, according to a FactSet analysis consensus. That would give Tesla about 1.65 million sales for all of 2025, a drop of 7.7 percent and well below the level BYD had attained by end November.

Deutsche Bank, which projects just 405,000 Tesla EV sales during the fourth quarter, sees the company's sales down by around one-third in both North America and Europe, and by one-tenth in China.

- Transition period -

Industry watchers say it will take time for EV demand to reach a level of equilibrium in the United States following the elimination of the $7,500 US tax credit at the end of September 2025.

Even prior to that, Tesla had seen sales struggle in key markets over CEO Musk's political support of Trump and other far-right politicians. Tesla has also faced rising EV competition from BYD and other Chinese companies and from European giants.

""We believe Tesla will see some weakness on deliveries"" in the fourth quarter, said Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities.

Sales of 420,000 would be ""good enough to show stable demand,"" with Wall Street ""laser focused on the autonomous chapter kicking off in 2026,"" Ives added, referring to plans for self-driving vehicles.

Even as it has grown quickly, BYD has faced challenges in its home market.

With profitability in China weighed down by price-wary consumers, the company has sought to strengthen its foothold in foreign markets.

BYD is ""one of the pioneers to establish overseas production capacity and supply chains for EVs,"" Jing Yang, Director of Asia-Pacific Corporate Ratings at Fitch Ratings, told AFP.

""Going forward, its geographical diversification is likely to help it to navigate an increasingly complicated global tariff environment,"" said Yang.

Overseas rivals to BYD have balked at Chinese state subsidies and other state supports that have allowed the company to sell vehicles cheaply.

Trump's predecessor Joe Biden imposed 100 percent tariffs on Chinese EV imports that could potentially go even higher under Trump. Europe has also imposed tariffs on Chinese imports, but BYD is building manufacturing capacity in Hungary.

While the chance of Tesla reclaiming its global leadership in EVs looks uncertain, the American company is also potentially positioned for growth.

Michaeli of TD Cowen sees autonomous technology playing an increasingly important role for Tesla, with breakthroughs in its ""full self-driving"" or ""FSD"" offerings potentially boosting sales.

""As Tesla really begins to roll out eyes-off features and expand FSDs capability, if they do that successfully, that should generate more demand for their vehicles,"" Michaeli said.

Musk has said the Cybercab, an autonomous robotaxi model, will begin production in April 2026. The company has also unveiled lower-priced versions of the Models 3 and Y that could boost sales.

As Jing Yang from Fitch Ratings points out, this global push helps cushion against market ups and downs.

Meanwhile, Tesla faces tough competition and some political drama at home, so it's betting big on self-driving tech with plans for an autonomous robotaxi launch in April 2026 to spark new interest.

This unpublished Fourth Circuit decision, Clinchfield Coal Company v. Director, Office of Workers' Compensation Programs & Johnny L. Wallace, No. 24‑1875 (4th Cir. Dec. 23, 2025), arises under the Black Lung Benefits Act (BLBA), 30 U.S.C. §§ 901–944. The case concerns a miner, Johnny Wallace, who filed a subsequent claim for federal black lung benefits after his initial claim was denied. An Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) awarded benefits; the Benefits Review Board (BRB or Board) affirmed; and Clinchfield Coal Company petitioned the Fourth Circuit for review.

Although unpublished and therefore not binding precedent in the Fourth Circuit, this opinion is a detailed application of recent BLBA case law, especially Island Creek Coal Co. v. Blankenship, 123 F.4th 684 (4th Cir. 2024), American Energy, LLC v. Director, OWCP, 106 F.4th 319 (4th Cir. 2024), and Extra Energy, Inc. v. Lawson, 140 F.4th 138 (4th Cir. 2025). It reinforces several important principles:

The strong deference owed to an ALJ’s weighing of conflicting medical evidence in black lung claims, particularly in ""battle of the experts"" situations involving both coal dust exposure and long-term smoking.

The permissibility and scope of using the Department of Labor’s Preamble to the black lung regulations as scientific context when assessing medical opinions.

The doctrine of abandonment of issues based on inadequate briefing in the court of appeals and failure to raise arguments before the BRB.

How proof of legal pneumoconiosis can effectively satisfy multiple elements of entitlement, including disease, disease arising out of coal mine employment, and disability causation.

The Fourth Circuit ultimately denied Clinchfield’s petition for review, leaving intact the award of black lung benefits to Wallace.

II. Summary of the Opinion

The court’s disposition and principal holdings can be summarized as follows:

The Fourth Circuit reviews the BRB’s legal conclusions de novo but defers to the ALJ’s factual findings if supported by substantial evidence, consistent with Island Creek.

Under Fed. R. App. P. 28(a)(8)(A), Clinchfield abandoned its challenge to the ALJ’s finding of total disability by offering only a bare, conclusory assertion without developed argument or record citations.

Clinchfield likewise abandoned any challenge to the ALJ’s credibility findings regarding its own experts (Drs. Sargent and McSharry) by not properly raising that challenge before the BRB.

The ALJ’s finding that Wallace suffers from legal pneumoconiosis (COPD/emphysema/chronic bronchitis significantly related to coal dust exposure) is supported by substantial evidence, particularly the opinion of Dr. Habre, which was based on corrected and accurate coal mine and smoking histories.

The ALJ permissibly gave reduced weight to Dr. Mabe’s opinion because it relied on inaccurate exposure and smoking histories, and permissibly rejected key aspects of Drs. Sargent’s and McSharry’s opinions because they dismissed a valid, qualifying pulmonary function test (PFT) and over-relied on negative x-rays.

The ALJ properly relied on the regulatory Preamble as one factor in evaluating Dr. McSharry’s failure to address the additive effects of coal dust and smoking, consistent with American Energy and Extra Energy; the ALJ did not shift the burden of proof to Clinchfield.

Because ""legal pneumoconiosis"" by definition ""arises out of coal mine employment,"" establishing legal pneumoconiosis satisfied both the first (existence of pneumoconiosis) and second (arising out of coal mine employment) entitlement elements.

The ALJ’s finding that Wallace’s pneumoconiosis was a substantially contributing cause of his total disability is supported by substantial evidence, especially in light of American Energy and Toler v. Eastern Assoc. Coal Co., 43 F.3d 109 (4th Cir. 1995).

Because the BRB affirmed based on legal pneumoconiosis alone and did not rely on the ALJ’s clinical pneumoconiosis finding, the Fourth Circuit did not address Clinchfield’s x‑ray-based arguments; its review is limited to the grounds used by the BRB (Extra Energy).

III. Detailed Analysis

A. Factual and Procedural Background

Johnny Wallace originally filed a black lung claim in 2010. That claim was denied because he failed to prove:

that he had pneumoconiosis,

that he was totally disabled by a pulmonary or respiratory impairment, and

that any pneumoconiosis was caused by his coal mine work.

In July 2019, Wallace filed a subsequent claim. Under 20 C.F.R. § 725.309(c), a subsequent claim can be considered only if the miner proves a ""change in an applicable condition of entitlement""—meaning that at least one element of entitlement that was previously decided against the claimant is now proven. Here, Wallace’s later success in establishing total disability satisfied this threshold.

The ALJ made several key factual findings:

Wallace had 13.44 years of qualifying coal mine employment.

His usual coal mine work (roof bolter doing ""face work"" underground) required medium to heavy exertion and involved substantial coal dust exposure.

He had a smoking history of at least 30 pack‑years and was still smoking about one‑quarter pack per day.

The medical evidence came from four physicians:

Dr. Donovan Mabe (DOL-sponsored exam, Dec. 2019): diagnosed both clinical and legal pneumoconiosis; found total disability from pulmonary/respiratory impairment; attributed disability substantially to coal dust exposure.

Dr. Antoine Habre (claimant’s expert, two exams in Dec. 2021): likewise diagnosed clinical and legal pneumoconiosis; found total disability; and opined that coal dust exposure substantially contributed to the impairment, particularly by worsening emphysema and chronic bronchitis.

Dr. Jeffrey Sargent (employer’s expert, May 2020) and Dr. Roger McSharry (employer’s expert, Oct. 2021): both concluded that Wallace did not have clinical or legal pneumoconiosis, was not totally disabled by any significant pulmonary impairment, and that any impairment was attributable solely to cigarette smoking.

After hearing and weighing this evidence, the ALJ:

Found a valid and qualifying PFT (Dec. 14, 2021) supporting total respiratory disability.

Credited Drs. Habre and, to a lesser extent, Mabe on the existence of legal pneumoconiosis and causation.

Discounted key aspects of Drs. Sargent’s and McSharry’s opinions, particularly their rejection of the qualifying PFT and their failure to adequately consider coal dust as a causal or aggravating factor.

Found that Wallace had both clinical and legal pneumoconiosis and was totally disabled, with pneumoconiosis substantially contributing to that disability.

The BRB affirmed the ALJ’s findings on:

total disability,

legal pneumoconiosis, and

disability causation as to legal pneumoconiosis.

Crucially, the BRB did not reach or rely on the ALJ’s finding of clinical pneumoconiosis. Clinchfield then petitioned the Fourth Circuit for review.

B. Standard of Review and Administrative Law Framework

The court applied the standard articulated in Island Creek Coal Co. v. Blankenship, 123 F.4th 684 (4th Cir. 2024):

It reviews the BRB’s legal conclusions de novo.

It defers to the ALJ’s factual findings if supported by substantial evidence—that is, ""more than a mere scintilla"" and ""such relevant evidence that a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.""

The court also stressed that the ALJ must:

analyze all relevant evidence; and

adequately explain the rationale for crediting or discrediting evidence.

At the same time, consistent with Island Creek, the ALJ’s ""duty of explanation is not intended to be a mandate for administrative verbosity."" The explanation is adequate if the reviewing court can understand what the ALJ did and why.

This framework is critical: it underscores that appellate courts, especially in BLBA cases, are not fact-finders. Their role is to ensure that the ALJ’s decision is both legally correct and supported by substantial evidence—not to re‑weigh competing medical opinions.

C. Precedents and Authorities Cited

The opinion relies heavily on the following authorities:

Island Creek Coal Co. v. Blankenship, 123 F.4th 684 (4th Cir. 2024)

Provides the standard of review in black lung appeals, emphasizing substantial evidence review of ALJ fact‑finding and the sufficiency of a clear, but not excessively verbose, explanation of reasoning.

Extra Energy, Inc. v. Lawson, 140 F.4th 138 (4th Cir. 2025)

Discusses the BLBA’s purpose (""to provide benefits to coal miners who are totally disabled due to pneumoconiosis""); elaborates on review of causation in the presence of smoking; underscores that appellate courts must not substitute their judgment for the ALJ’s in ""battle of the experts"" situations; and clarifies the permissible use of the Preamble to the black lung regulations.

Also important for the principle that the Fourth Circuit’s review is limited to the grounds relied upon by the BRB.

American Energy, LLC v. Director, OWCP, 106 F.4th 319 (4th Cir. 2024)

Sets out the four elements a miner must prove by a preponderance of the evidence:

Existence of pneumoconiosis (clinical or legal);

That the pneumoconiosis arose out of coal mine employment;

Total disability due to a pulmonary or respiratory impairment; and

Pneumoconiosis is a substantially contributing cause of total disability.

It also explains:

The distinction between clinical and legal pneumoconiosis;

The inclusion of COPD (chronic bronchitis, emphysema, asthma) in ""legal"" pneumoconiosis;

That once ""legal pneumoconiosis"" is shown, the ""arising out of coal mine employment"" element is automatically satisfied; and

That in some cases, establishing legal pneumoconiosis may effectively satisfy the causation element as well when the same condition causes the disability.

Edwards v. City of Goldsboro, 178 F.3d 231 (4th Cir. 1999)

Interprets Fed. R. App. P. 28(a)(8)(A) and holds that failure to develop an argument with reasons and supporting citations in an opening brief results in abandonment of that claim on appeal.

Toler v. Eastern Assoc. Coal Co., 43 F.3d 109 (4th Cir. 1995)

Holds that once an ALJ has found that a claimant has pneumoconiosis and is totally disabled, the ALJ generally may not credit a doctor’s opinion that pneumoconiosis did not cause the disability if that opinion rests on the premise that the miner does not have pneumoconiosis or is not disabled. To credit such an opinion, the ALJ must find ""specific and persuasive reasons"" showing the doctor’s causation analysis is independent of those erroneous premises.

Regulatory provisions

20 C.F.R. § 725.309(c): Defines what constitutes a ""change in an applicable condition of entitlement"" for subsequent claims.

20 C.F.R. § 718.201(a)(2), (b), (c): Defines ""legal pneumoconiosis"" as any chronic lung disease or impairment ""significantly related to, or substantially aggravated by,"" coal dust exposure, and recognizes pneumoconiosis as a latent and progressive disease that may first become detectable after coal dust exposure ceases.

20 C.F.R. § 718.204(b)(1)–(2), (c)(1): Defines ""total disability"" and sets out methods of proof (including qualifying PFTs and medical opinions) and when pneumoconiosis is a ""substantially contributing cause"" of disability.

Preamble to the Regulations Implementing the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969, 65 Fed. Reg. 79920, 79941 (Dec. 20, 2000)

The Preamble summarizes the medical and scientific evidence underlying the regulations, including:

That coal dust exposure can cause COPD, even in the absence of radiographic evidence of clinical pneumoconiosis.

That the effects of coal dust and cigarette smoking on lung function are often additive or synergistic.

Fourth Circuit precedent permits ALJs to consult the Preamble as scientific context when evaluating medical opinions.

D. The Court’s Legal Reasoning

1. Total Disability: Abandonment Through Inadequate Briefing

The ALJ found total disability based on:

A valid, qualifying PFT performed on December 14, 2021 during Dr. Habre’s evaluation; and

Medical opinion evidence (Drs. Mabe and Habre) concluding Wallace could not perform his usual coal mine work or similar employment given his respiratory limitations.

Under 20 C.F.R. § 718.204(b)(2)(i)-(iv), total disability can be established through:

Qualifying PFTs,

Qualifying arterial blood gas studies,

Evidence of cor pulmonale with right‑sided congestive heart failure, or

Reasoned medical opinions.

Both Drs. Sargent and McSharry acknowledged that the Dec. 14, 2021 PFT was numerically ""qualifying"" but insisted it was invalid due to poor effort and that Wallace’s lung function was ""normal or close to normal."" The ALJ rejected that characterization and credited Dr. Habre’s view that the PFT was valid.

On appeal, Clinchfield offered only ""a single, conclusory statement"" that the ALJ’s total disability finding was erroneous, without any supporting argument. Citing Fed. R. App. P. 28(a)(8)(A) and Edwards, the court held that this failure to provide developed argument triggered abandonment:

""Failure to comply with the specific dictates of this rule with respect to a particular claim triggers abandonment of that claim on appeal.""

Thus, the total disability finding became effectively unchallenged and binding for purposes of the court’s review. This is significant: employers (and claimants) must fully brief any issue they wish to preserve.

2. Legal vs. Clinical Pneumoconiosis and Mixed Etiology

The court restated the distinction between:

Clinical pneumoconiosis: recognized medical conditions such as coal workers’ pneumoconiosis, usually shown by x‑ray or pathology, involving the deposition of coal dust particles and fibrotic reaction in the lungs.

Legal pneumoconiosis: a broader regulatory category that covers any chronic lung disease or impairment and its sequela ""significantly related to, or substantially aggravated by"" coal dust exposure. This expressly includes COPD, chronic bronchitis, emphysema, and asthma.

Critically:

Coal dust need not be the exclusive cause of the impairment.

A miner may have a long and substantial smoking history and still establish legal pneumoconiosis if coal dust exposure is a significant contributor or aggravator of the disease.

It can be difficult—even for experts—to precisely differentiate between the effects of smoking and the effects of coal dust, but that difficulty does not defeat a legal pneumoconiosis finding.

The Fourth Circuit emphasized (following Extra Energy) that this area of law has generated repeated litigation, but the court has ""never deviated"" from its standard of review: the ALJ is the one who resolves the ""battle of the experts."" The appellate court defers to the ALJ’s weight-of-the-evidence determinations if properly reasoned and supported.

3. Crediting the Claimant’s Expert (Dr. Habre) on Legal Pneumoconiosis

Clinchfield’s principal attack on the legal pneumoconiosis finding was that the ALJ allegedly failed to recognize that Drs. Mabe and Habre used:

an overstated coal mine employment history, and

a minimized smoking history.

The court rejected this characterization. It carefully tracked the ALJ’s handling of each physician:

Dr. Mabe:

Believed Wallace had 16 years of coal mine work and only 5 pack‑years of smoking, both inaccurate.

The ALJ recognized this error and gave his opinions reduced weight on that basis.

Importantly, the ALJ did not rely primarily on Mabe’s opinion to establish legal pneumoconiosis.

Dr. Habre:

Initially recorded 16 years of coal mine employment and no smoking history in early reports, but was ""always aware"" of ongoing smoking based on arterial blood gas (ABG) findings.

Before rendering his final opinions, he was explicitly informed that:

the agency had calculated 13 years of qualifying coal mine employment; and

Wallace had a smoking history exceeding 30 pack‑years.

Dr. Habre then adjusted his analysis and expressly acknowledged both:

the significant smoking history; and

substantial coal dust exposure, including intensive ""face"" work as a roof bolter with high dust levels.

He diagnosed emphysema and chronic bronchitis, recognized smoking as a contributor, but concluded that coal dust exposure played a substantial role in the decline of lung function and the disabling impairment.

He reasoned that coal dust worsened Wallace’s emphysema and aggravated his symptoms, in line with the known synergistic impact of coal dust and smoking.

He grounded his conclusions in:

accurate occupational and smoking histories,

chest x‑ray findings,

PFT results (including the qualifying 2021 PFT),

chronic bronchitis and clinical symptom profile, and

accepted medical understanding of combined exposures.

On that basis, the ALJ gave probative and dispositive weight to Dr. Habre’s final, corrected opinion and found that Wallace established legal pneumoconiosis. The Fourth Circuit held that this reasoning was both:

accurately grounded in the record; and

adequately explained.

Thus, the court affirmed the ALJ’s choice to rely on Dr. Habre over Clinchfield’s experts regarding the existence of legal pneumoconiosis.

4. Discounting Employer’s Experts and the Role of the Preamble

Clinchfield argued the ALJ improperly discredited Drs. Sargent and McSharry and shifted the burden of proof to the employer to disprove legal pneumoconiosis.

Procedural abandonment at the BRB stage. The court first noted a procedural bar:

Clinchfield did not directly challenge the ALJ’s reasons for discrediting these experts before the BRB.

The BRB therefore affirmed the ALJ’s credibility findings on that basis.

On appeal, Clinchfield did not contend that it had properly raised this issue to the BRB or that the BRB erred in its approach.

Consequently, any challenge to the ALJ’s weighing of these experts was abandoned.

Substantive review (even if preserved). The court went on to hold that even if the issue were preserved, the ALJ’s treatment of employer’s experts was legally proper:

Drs. Sargent and McSharry:

Concluded Wallace had no significant pulmonary impairment and no legal pneumoconiosis;

Based this in part on their belief that there were no valid PFTs or ABGs showing significant lung disease;

Dismissed the Dec. 14, 2021 PFT as invalid, contrary to the ALJ’s now unchallenged finding that it was both valid and qualifying for total disability purposes;

Relied, at least partly, on the absence of positive x‑ray evidence; but negative x‑rays cannot rule out legal pneumoconiosis because legal pneumoconiosis does not depend on radiographic findings.

The ALJ’s decision to give limited weight to opinions that:

contradicted the ALJ’s own well-supported finding of a valid, qualifying PFT; and

placed undue weight on x‑rays in the context of legal pneumoconiosis

was fully consistent with substantial-evidence review and prior case law.

Use of the Preamble. Clinchfield further argued that the ALJ improperly relied on the Preamble, particularly in criticizing Dr. McSharry for not addressing whether coal dust played any role in Wallace’s pulmonary impairment.

The Fourth Circuit reaffirmed its holdings in American Energy and Extra Energy:

ALJs are permitted to consult the Preamble when evaluating the credibility of medical opinions on both:

the existence of pneumoconiosis; and

the cause of the miner’s disabling impairment.

ALJs may note ""tensions"" or inconsistencies between a physician’s reasoning and the medical-scientific principles reflected in the Preamble.

However, they may not mechanically discredit an opinion solely because it conflicts with the Preamble without proper explanation.

The court found that the ALJ’s use of the Preamble here was proper:

The ALJ did not discredit Dr. McSharry solely because he failed to consider coal dust or because his conclusions conflicted with the Preamble.

Instead, the ALJ:

identified several independent reasons for discounting his opinion (rejection of the valid PFT, overreliance on x‑rays, etc.); and

used the Preamble only as one additional factor to highlight his failure to consider the additive effects of coal dust and smoking.

Consistent with Extra Energy, this context-sensitive use of the Preamble was entirely permissible.

The court also rejected Clinchfield’s argument that the ALJ erred in crediting Habre over its experts based on the time gap between Wallace’s coal mine employment and the first abnormal PFT. Citing 20 C.F.R. § 718.201(c), the court reminded that pneumoconiosis is a latent and progressive disease and may become detectable only after coal dust exposure has ceased. The ALJ was entitled to prefer the experts who accepted this premise over those who did not.

5. Satisfying Multiple Elements Through Legal Pneumoconiosis

The Fourth Circuit underscored a doctrinally important point drawn from American Energy:

Once a miner proves legal pneumoconiosis—i.e., that his chronic lung disease is significantly related to or substantially aggravated by coal dust exposure—he automatically satisfies the requirement that the disease arose out of coal mine employment.

As the court put it:

""A miner who satisfies the first element of his claim by establishing legal pneumoconiosis necessarily satisfies [the] second element [because,] by definition, legal pneumoconiosis arises out of coal mine employment.""

Moreover, in some circumstances, such as where COPD itself both constitutes legal pneumoconiosis and is the cause of total disability, establishing legal pneumoconiosis may effectively satisfy the causation element as well.

6. Disability Causation and the Toler Constraint

The final element Wallace had to prove was that pneumoconiosis was a ""substantially contributing cause"" of his total disability, under 20 C.F.R. § 718.204(c)(1). This is satisfied if pneumoconiosis either:

has a material adverse effect on the miner’s respiratory or pulmonary condition; or

materially worsens a totally disabling respiratory or pulmonary impairment caused by another condition (e.g., smoking).

The ALJ found:

Wallace’s total disability resulted from COPD and emphysema.

Those conditions were made significantly worse by coal dust exposure—i.e., they constituted legal pneumoconiosis.

Dr. Habre’s opinion (and, to a lesser extent, Dr. Mabe’s) credibly linked coal dust exposure to the disabling impairment.

This reasoning ""dovetailed"" with the earlier legal pneumoconiosis finding. As American Energy notes, in such cases, proof of legal pneumoconiosis may essentially resolve the causation element: the same disease (COPD/emphysema) both qualifies as legal pneumoconiosis and causes the disabling respiratory limitations.

The ALJ then applied Toler:

Drs. Sargent and McSharry opined that pneumoconiosis played no role in Wallace’s disability—but their opinions were premised on the absence of legal pneumoconiosis and, in effect, on the absence of any significant pulmonary impairment.

Having found that Wallace does have legal pneumoconiosis and is totally disabled, the ALJ could credit those causation opinions only if she found ""specific and persuasive reasons"" showing that their no‑causation views did not rest on those erroneous premises.

The ALJ found no such reasons; instead, the record suggested that their causation analysis was inextricably tied to their rejection of pneumoconiosis itself.

The Fourth Circuit agreed that the ALJ properly applied Toler and that her causation finding was supported by substantial evidence.

7. Limited Scope of Review: Legal vs. Clinical Pneumoconiosis

Clinchfield also attempted to attack the ALJ’s finding that x‑rays showed simple (clinical) pneumoconiosis. However:

The BRB did not rely on that clinical pneumoconiosis finding; it affirmed solely on the basis of legal pneumoconiosis and its contribution to disability.

Under Extra Energy, the Fourth Circuit’s review is limited to the grounds actually relied upon by the BRB.

Therefore, the court declined to reach the clinical pneumoconiosis/x‑ray issue and found no reason to remand. The Board’s decision, grounded in legal pneumoconiosis and causation, was adequately supported by the ALJ’s record-based findings.

E. Impact and Practical Implications

1. For Claimants

This decision reinforces that miners with mixed etiologies (smoking plus coal dust) can still prevail if they show coal dust significantly contributed to or aggravated COPD/emphysema.

Independent medical opinions that:

use accurate exposure and smoking histories,

engage all objective testing (including PFTs and ABGs), and

explicitly address additive effects of coal dust and smoking

will carry significant weight with ALJs and withstand appellate review.

The decision shows that a prior denial is not the end: a miner who later demonstrates total disability can meet the ""change in an applicable condition of entitlement"" standard for a subsequent claim.

2. For Employers and Insurers

Experts must be prepared to:

engage with the Preamble’s medical principles (especially coal dust–related COPD and additive effects with smoking); and

offer a reasoned, scientifically grounded explanation when attributing disease solely to smoking in a miner with substantial coal dust exposure.

Attempts to discredit PFTs as invalid must be robustly supported; if the ALJ finds the test valid and qualifying, opinions premised on ""no valid PFT"" will be vulnerable to being discounted.

It is crucial to preserve issues:

Arguments not properly raised before the BRB may be treated as waived in the court of appeals.

Arguments that are presented in only skeletal form in the Fourth Circuit brief will be deemed abandoned.

3. For ALJs and the BRB

The case validates ALJs’ use of the Preamble as scientific guidance, provided they:

do not rely on it mechanistically; and

explain how tensions between a physician’s reasoning and the Preamble bear on credibility.

It confirms that ALJs may:

discount medical opinions based on inaccurate coal mine and smoking histories; but

credit opinions where the physician corrects those histories and updates their conclusions accordingly.

ALJs are reminded to:

give clear, organized explanations of why certain medical opinions are credited or discredited;

explicitly tie factual findings (e.g., validity of tests, years of exposure, smoking history) to their evaluation of expert opinions.

The BRB’s practice of declining to review arguments that were not adequately raised below is reinforced, as is the principle that appellate review is limited to the grounds on which the BRB relied.

F. Clarifying Key Legal and Medical Concepts

1. Clinical vs. Legal Pneumoconiosis

Clinical pneumoconiosis:

The traditional medical disease recognized as coal workers’ pneumoconiosis.

Usually diagnosed via chest x‑ray or pathology showing coal dust particles and fibrotic nodules.

Legal pneumoconiosis:

A regulatory concept encompassing any chronic lung disease or impairment ""significantly related to, or substantially aggravated by"" coal dust exposure.

Includes chronic bronchitis, emphysema, COPD, asthma, etc., when linked to coal dust.

Does not require x‑ray or pathological proof of classic ""coal workers’ pneumoconiosis.""

2. Substantial Evidence

""Substantial evidence"" is:

More than a ""mere scintilla"" of evidence; and

That which a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion—even if another decision-maker might weigh the evidence differently.

This standard gives substantial deference to the ALJ’s factual findings, especially in technical, expert-heavy cases like BLBA claims.

3. Abandonment of Issues on Appeal

Under Fed. R. App. P. 28(a)(8)(A), an appellant’s brief must include:

contentions,

reasons, and

citations to authorities and parts of the record.

Failure to develop an argument with reasoning and support—such as offering only a conclusory sentence—results in abandonment of that issue in the appellate court.

Similarly, issues not raised (or insufficiently raised) before the BRB cannot ordinarily be raised for the first time in the court of appeals.

4. Qualifying Pulmonary Function Tests (PFTs)

Under the BLBA regulations, PFT results are compared to regulatory tables that set threshold values (based on age, height, sex) to determine whether the test is ""qualifying"" for total disability. A test is:

Qualifying if the FEV1 and other relevant measures meet or fall below the table values, indicating significant impairment.

Valid if it meets technical and procedural quality standards (proper effort, cooperation, reproducibility, etc.).

An ALJ may accept one physician’s assessment of validity over another’s, provided the choice is reasoned and explained.

5. Latent and Progressive Nature of Pneumoconiosis

20 C.F.R. § 718.201(c) recognizes that pneumoconiosis:

may be latent (not clinically evident immediately); and

may be progressive (worsening over time),

such that it may first become detectable only after coal dust exposure has ended. Thus, a significant lapse of time between cessation of coal mine work and observed pulmonary impairment does not, by itself, refute pneumoconiosis.

6. ""Substantially Contributing Cause"" in BLBA Causation

Pneumoconiosis substantially contributes to disability if it:

has a material adverse effect on the respiratory condition; or

materially worsens an existing totally disabling impairment from other causes (like smoking).

This is a less demanding standard than sole causation or ""but-for"" causation. Coal dust need not be the only cause, but it must be a real, significant contributing factor.

IV. Conclusion

Clinchfield Coal Co. v. DOWCP (Wallace) does not break new doctrinal ground, but it powerfully illustrates how the Fourth Circuit’s recent BLBA jurisprudence operates in practice. It:

Reinforces that ALJs are the primary arbiters of complex expert evidence in black lung cases, and that their findings will be upheld if supported by substantial evidence and adequately explained.

Confirms the legitimacy of using the regulatory Preamble as scientific context when evaluating medical opinions, particularly on the interplay between coal dust and smoking.

Highlights the importance of accurate exposure and smoking histories in medical opinions, and validates ALJs’ decisions to discount opinions rooted in serious factual errors.

Shows how establishing legal pneumoconiosis (especially COPD/emphysema tied to coal dust) can simultaneously satisfy multiple elements of BLBA entitlement, including origin and causation.

Emphasizes strict enforcement of procedural rules on issue preservation and briefing: undeveloped arguments in the court of appeals and issues not adequately raised before the BRB will be treated as abandoned or waived.

In combination with Island Creek, American Energy, and Extra Energy, this case further consolidates a coherent, claimant-accessible framework for adjudicating black lung claims in the Fourth Circuit, particularly where coal dust exposure and heavy smoking coexist. Although unpublished, it will likely serve as a persuasive example for future litigants and adjudicators navigating similar battles over medical causation and the weight of expert testimony under the Black Lung Benefits Act.",https://www.casemine.com/images/casemine-share.jpg,N,,2025-12-29 11:13:10.737709

""What's also happening is Standard sales are cannibalizing into sales of Premium versions, especially the Model 3.""
""Tesla has a serious challenge on its hands next year when several other automakers are planning to roll out cheaper vehicles that are also full of fun features,"" she told the news outlet.
Why is Tesla's sales slump important?
Plummeting sales could hamper resale values for current Tesla owners, with oversupply and weakening demand usually depressing used car prices.","Tesla's U.S. sales dropped to a near four-year low in November, a troubling trend for the electric vehicle maker despite the launch of cheaper versions of its popular models.

What's happening?

Tesla sold 39,800 vehicles domestically in the month of November, down nearly 23% from 51,513 vehicles this time last year, according to data from Cox Automotive provided to Reuters. The November tally was the automaker's lowest monthly sales since January 2022.

The company launched stripped-down ""Standard"" versions of its Model Y SUV and Model 3 sedan in October, priced around $5,000 below previous base models. These cheaper EVs were intended to boost demand after the Trump administration ended the available federal tax credits in late September.

However, the new offerings appear to have failed in preventing Tesla's sales slide.

""The drop certainly shows there is not enough demand for the Standard variants that were supposed to boost sales after the tax credit expiry,"" Stephanie Valdez Streaty, Cox's director of industry insights, told Reuters. ""What's also happening is Standard sales are cannibalizing into sales of Premium versions, especially the Model 3.""

The problems might not end there, according to Streaty.

""Tesla has a serious challenge on its hands next year when several other automakers are planning to roll out cheaper vehicles that are also full of fun features,"" she told the news outlet. ""So the answer is that Tesla needs a completely new vehicle in its fleet. Period.""

Why is Tesla's sales slump important?

The sales decline affects both the company and its customers. Plummeting sales could hamper resale values for current Tesla owners, with oversupply and weakening demand usually depressing used car prices.

Customers thinking about purchasing a Tesla may also be facing uncertainty about whether the brand itself is losing momentum or is no longer something they wish to be affiliated with due to CEO Elon Musk's work for the Trump administration and far-right political rhetoric.

The automaker also hasn't introduced a new vehicle since the Cybertruck, which has struggled to find its footing in the marketplace. The rest of Tesla's fleet of vehicles consists of older models with minor refreshes, leaving customers with fewer compelling reasons to choose them over newer competitors in the marketplace.

Tesla's sales challenges have dominated the headlines for much of 2025, with the company needing a nearly impossible December to avoid finishing the year down in China, the world's largest EV market, per Electrek.

What's being done about EV adoption?

Despite Tesla's struggles, the broader EV transition continues.

Other automakers are planning to roll out cheaper EVs with new features in 2026, giving consumers more options for making the switch from gas-powered vehicles.

If you're thinking about making the switch, many manufacturers now offer compelling alternatives across several price points. Going electric can cut your fuel costs and reduce maintenance expenses, with each new EV on the road replacing the pollution from gas-powered cars with clearer air in our communities.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Tesla-salesimage-recHphVe9CQVa0WCb.jpg,N,,2025-12-28 19:56:58.065091

However, the resulting cost of replacing this wasted wind power — typically with gas-fired power generation — has jumped from £835 million to £1.08 billion.
Octopus Energy said: “Britain paid over £1 billion in 2025 to switch off wind farms and burn expensive gas instead — wasting clean, homegrown energy.
The regulator said that without this investment households would have faced an extra £55 a year in “constraint” costs to pay wind farms to switch off.

With just three days of the year left to go, the payments to wind farm owners to switch off have actually fallen slightly year on year, to £380 million from £395 million. However, the resulting cost of replacing this wasted wind power — typically with gas-fired power generation — has jumped from £835 million to £1.08 billion.

Octopus Energy said: “Britain paid over £1 billion in 2025 to switch off wind farms and burn expensive gas instead — wasting clean, homegrown energy. These costs are already absurd, and without urgent reform, they will soar to £8 billion a year by 2030. Fixing this broken system would unleash the full power of British renewables, cut bills, boost energy security and clean up the grid for good.”

• Thunderer: Britain is a leading light in wind power — don’t blow it now

Sam Richards of pro-growth campaign Britain Remade told the Telegraph, which first reported the full-year figures: “It represents a catastrophic failure of the energy system, and households are paying the price for it.

“While businesses and households see their bills rise, we’re throwing away British-generated electricity and firing up expensive gas plants instead.

“The result is higher costs, higher emissions, and zero benefit to consumers. The solution is obvious. We need to build the infrastructure that will allow us to use the clean power we already have.”

In July Ofgem said that the rising costs of paying wind farms to switch themselves off and paying for replacements had added £15 to a typical annual household energy bill from October.

In December the energy regulator approved plans that will see about £70 billion ploughed into upgrading Britain’s high-voltage electricity network over the next five years, adding about £60 to annual bills by 2030. The regulator said that without this investment households would have faced an extra £55 a year in “constraint” costs to pay wind farms to switch off. Even with this investment constraints are still expected to rise by about £10 per household per year, in addition to the levies to fund the network investment.

The rising costs are a further headache for the energy secretary Ed Miliband’s efforts to deliver on a pledge of cutting energy bills by £300 a year.

The Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said: “We are reversing decades of underinvestment and delivering the biggest upgrade to the grid, which will minimise constraint costs, meet the capacity needed to deliver clean power by 2030, and help bring down bills for households for good.

“The more renewables on the system, the cheaper the wholesale price of electricity, which is why the only answer for Britain is our mission to get us off the rollercoaster of fossil fuel prices and onto clean, homegrown power we control.”

Neso said: “We are determined to play our part in keeping the costs of balancing the electricity system as low as possible, which is why, through the development of new tools and close collaboration with industry, we have saved consumers at least £1.2 billion.

“Balancing costs are not fixed, and the delivery of new electricity network transmission infrastructure and future electricity market arrangements will be key to lowering these costs for consumers.”",https://www.thetimes.com/imageserver/image/%2F25ae6cb5-b0a3-402f-9b93-10110e9ef8ea.jpg?crop=5025%2C2827%2C0%2C436&resize=1200,N,,2025-12-28 19:57:05.093735

Commercial production of ammonia from BNA is expected to begin following handover to Woodside Energy (“Woodside”) from OCI Global (“OCI”) in early 2026. Production of lower-carbon ammonia is targeted to start in the second half of 2026.

Demand for lower-carbon ammonia continues to develop globally, with strong interest from customers in Europe and Asia as they pursue energy security and decarbonisation objectives.

Woodside has also finalised agreements with leading global customers to supply significant volumes of conventional ammonia from the BNA facility.

Deliveries will commence in 2026 and continue through year-end, under contracts that reflect prevailing market prices. Additional agreements are being advanced to align with expected BNA output, including for lower-carbon ammonia.

Woodside Vice President Beaumont New Ammonia Kellyanne Lochan said: “We are pleased with the results of the commissioning and systems testing completed to date. These outcomes confirm the facility’s production readiness and our ability to move toward commercial start-up following handover. This milestone also reflects the disciplined work of both the OCI and Woodside teams.”

In the lead-up to handover, the project will continue with additional verification, performance testing, and operational preparedness activities. OCI and Woodside remain focused on ensuring the facility safely and efficiently enters full operations, in line with regulatory and contractual requirements.

BNA has a production capacity of 1.1 million tonnes per annum and is designed to support growing demand for ammonia, lower-carbon ammonia and hydrogen-adjacent products. Once operational, BNA has the potential to approximately double US ammonia exports1, contributing to regional economic growth and supporting American energy leadership.

That’s foundational for it to be credible,” Julie Segal, senior program manager, climate finance at Environmental Defence Canada, said in an email.
Now, “the reconfirmed sustainable investment taxonomy, in moving forward, has to be fossil-free and centre independent experts outside of the financial sector.
That’s foundational for it to be credible,” Julie Segal, senior program manager, climate finance at Environmental Defence Canada, said in an email.","This story is part of a selection of our top news from 2025 that we’re republishing during the holiday break. We’ll be back to our regular schedule in the new year.

A climate competitiveness strategy that sidestepped emission reduction mandates for fossil fuel producers and set the stage to repeal a hard-fought cap on the industry’s carbon pollution was a centrepiece of the federal budget released in November by Finance Minister François-Philippe Champagne.

The budget, titled Canada Strong, is the first produced by the government of Prime Minister Mark Carney. It reprises past promises to fast-track controversial new infrastructure projects, speed up new housing construction, and diversify the country’s trading relationships, increases military spending by $81.8 billion over five years, puts limits on the government’s commitments to sustainable finance and anti-greenwashing rules, and curtails the Trudeau government’s 2 Billion Trees program. It also lays out the broad lines of public service cutbacks that will slash $60 billion in federal spending and 40,000 jobs over five years, according to a memo issued Wednesday by the country’s top bureaucrat, Clerk of the Privy Council Michael Sabia.

Related: Nearly two dozen climate champions react to the budget in a live chat Tuesday evening hosted by The Energy Mix.

The budget places those changes in the context of the “profound transformation” sweeping the global economy.

“Industrial policy, once seen as secondary to market forces, is returning to the forefront,” the budget states. “In 2024 alone, governments worldwide introduced more than 2,500 industrial policy measures reflecting a transition in how governments are protecting national security interests and securing long-term competitiveness.”

In the United States, the Trump administration “is fundamentally reshaping all of its trading relationships and putting up trade barriers, with its average tariffs across all countries rising from around 2% at the end of 2024 to 17% today.” While the budget asserts repeatedly that Canada is faring better than other countries in its on-again, now off-again negotiations with the U.S., the impact of Trump’s tariff wars is still “profound—hurting companies, displacing workers, disrupting supply chains, and causing uncertainty that is curbing investment.”

As an antidote, the budget pitches an industrial strategy that pledges new infrastructure projects, public investment in research and development, lighter regulation, and tax deductions to trigger $500 billion in private sector investment over the next five years.

Competitiveness Over Climate?

The government’s climate competitiveness strategy was originally expected in mid- to late October, then delayed and folded into the budget announcement, prompting speculation that it wasn’t as fully defined as Carney had implied in his public statements. The published version cites climate action as an “economic necessity” as well as a “moral obligation”, at a time when “the world economy is undergoing a historic transformation towards low-carbon energy and clean technology.”

The document notes that global clean energy investments hit $2 trillion last year, nearly double the total poured into fossil fuels, and cites the Canadian Climate Institute’s warning that climate change will cut household incomes by nearly 20% by century’s end if it isn’t brought under control.

The strategy acknowledges that “buyers of Canada’s resources—oil and gas, steel, and aluminum—are increasingly looking for low-carbon sourcing.” It adds that “lowering our emissions is critical to protecting the competitiveness of Canada’s oil and gas and steel sectors. Reducing emissions is not only essential for environmental reasons, but also a key factor in securing access to markets that prioritize sustainability.”

But to meet that expectation, it sets sights on limiting the carbon intensity of Canadian industry—the emissions per barrel of oil or tonne of steel—rather than achieving actual reductions in climate pollution. In a sector like Canada’s oil sands, the difference matters—if production rises faster than emissions per barrel fall, the industry’s climate footprint will continue to grow. In September, the Climate Institute reported that the Canada’s progress on emissions flatlined in 2024, largely due to rising oil sands emissions, and the industry is planning on continuing production increases into the next decade.

The budget also:

• Allocates about $1 billion in tax incentives for “low-carbon liquefied natural gas facilities” that go into operation before 2030;

• Finalizes a clean electricity investment tax credit that was first introduced in the 2023 federal budget, but anticipates no spending at all through 2030;

• Extends the existing tax credit for carbon capture and storage by five years, to an end date of 2040 instead of 2035, but schedules no spending through 2030;

• Meets longstanding calls to expand the existing Scientific Research and Experimental Development (SR&ED) tax incentive system in ways that may disproportionately benefit early-stage clean technology companies;

• Cites the Darlington nuclear project outside Toronto, which will rely on uranium from the United States, as an example of “investing where it counts” in a new Buy Canada policy.

Trading Out the Emissions Cap

The budget stops short of eliminating the government’s watered-down, long-delayed cap on oil and gas emissions, but appears to trade it off for a stronger system of industrial carbon pricing and other measures meant to reduce the industry’s climate pollution.

The document says effective industrial carbon pricing is “essential to providing certainty to businesses looking to invest and compete internationally.” Already, it adds, that system “is expected to deliver more emission reductions than any other policy, with negligible impacts on affordability for Canadians.”

The budget pledges to “improve the effectiveness of carbon markets to provide confidence that credit prices will be predictable and sufficient to support clean growth investments without adversely affecting competitiveness or leading to carbon leakage.” Elements of that plan include:

• A multi-decade trajectory for industrial carbon pricing from 2030 through 2050, to be developed through engagement with provincial and territorial governments;

• Better federal benchmarks to ensure a consistent industrial carbon price across the country;

• Contracts for difference to give investors greater certainty about future carbon prices.

And to complement the industrial carbon price:

• Carrying on with the final, delayed version of federal Clean Electricity Regulations;

• Finalizing “enhanced” methane regulations for oil and gas operations and landfill sites, while allowing provincial and territorial governments to negotiate equivalency agreements based on their own control programs, with no reference in the document to serious, persistent problems in monitoring methane emissions;

• Future updates on electric vehicle mandates and clean fuel targets.

“Effective carbon markets, enhanced oil and gas methane regulations, and the deployment at scale of technologies such as carbon capture and storage would create the circumstances whereby the oil and gas emissions cap would no longer be needed as it would have marginal value in reducing emissions,” the budget states.

More New Homes, No Efficiency Target

The budget repeats Carney’s commitment of $13 billion over five years to launch the new Build Canada Homes agency and build up to 45,000 new housing units on existing federal lands. The program is meant to focus primarily on non-market housing and includes $423 million, already announced earlier this year, for eight new co-operative housing buildings.

Build Canada Homes aims to “catalyze maximum investment while mainstreaming advanced methods of construction, with the potential to cut building timelines by up to 50%, reduce costs by as much as 20%, and lower emissions by approximately 20% during construction,” the budget states. With that activity, “Canada can significantly increase its supply of affordable homes and become a global leader in housing innovation, including in construction techniques, sustainable materials, and leading-edge manufacturing.”

The budget makes no mention of energy efficiency or heat pump deployment targets for Build Canada Homes. Within 24 hours of the federal announcement, green building practitioners were worrying that the new units will become part of a huge backlog of homes awaiting energy retrofits to improve their performance and address heating and cooling costs that are an important factor in housing affordability.

Sustainable Finance Taxonomy: Target Date Set, Details Missing

The budget promises to complete its long-awaited sustainable finance taxonomy in 2026 and identify an arm’s length organization to develop sustainable investment guidelines by the end of this year. Canada’s taxonomy is an overdue response to a continuing international effort—in the field of finance, not biology—to set common definitions of sustainable investments that reduce emissions or support climate adaptation, and counter greenwashing around those activities.

“These investment guidelines will become an important, voluntary tool for investors, lenders, and other stakeholders navigating the global race to net-zero, by credibly identifying ‘green’ and ‘transition’ investments,” the budget states.

Those definitions have been the subject of fierce debate over more than three years, with some sustainable finance experts arguing it would be better to have no taxonomy at all than a system that allowed too much latitude for fossil fuel investment. Now, “the reconfirmed sustainable investment taxonomy, in moving forward, has to be fossil-free and centre independent experts outside of the financial sector. That’s foundational for it to be credible,” Julie Segal, senior program manager, climate finance at Environmental Defence Canada, said in an email.

“While it’s good that this government is paying attention to sustainable finance policies as it courts greater private sector investment, advancing solely on a taxonomy remains insufficient,” Segal added. “As Prime Minister Carney has said himself in previous roles, a cohesive package of mandatory transition plans, disclosure, and credible taxonomy is what’s needed. Until the full package of policies is delivered, it remains a missing piece of Canada’s climate plan.”

‘More Investor Risk’ with Weakened Greenwash Rules

The budget has also raised alarms by proposing to eliminate provisions in federal greenwashing legislation that require companies to verify environmental claims based on internationally recognized guidelines, and allow third parties to bring complaints to the federal Competition Tribunal.

In June, the Competition Bureau assured firms that the existing legislation, adopted by Parliament in June 2024, allows any marketing claims that aren’t false. But the budget still aims to offer “more certainty to the marketplace” by removing provisions that prompted fossil fuel companies and their lobby groups to not just update their websites, but burn them to the ground when the legislation was first adopted.

“The government’s proposal to weaken greenwashing provisions means more investor risk, particularly given the reluctance of provincial securities regulators to enforce accurate and complete disclosure in climate matters,” Matt Price, executive director of Investors for Paris Compliance, responded in a release.

“Removing the Competition Act amendments lets polluters mislead people in Canada and undermines truly sustainable businesses,” added the Canadian Association of Physicians for the Environment, one of the lead advocates for the legislation.

“Such needless retreat on climate and sustainable finance policy from a government led by Mark Carney is not something many experts would have expected,” said Adam Scott, executive director of Shift Action for Pension Wealth and Planet Health. “With the future stability and competitiveness of Canada’s economy on the line, we need much stronger leadership in the face of relentless industry lobbying. Canada needs credible guardrails in place to ensure the stability of our financial system and the climate.”

Cancelling the 2 Billion Trees Program

The budget signals a decision to wind down the Trudeau government’s commitment to plant two billion trees over 10 years, originally cast as “a significant step forward in Canada’s approach to tackle the dual crises of climate change and biodiversity loss.” Now, with nearly a billion trees committed, “existing contribution agreements and commitments will be honoured, and uncommitted funds will be returned,” the budget says.

With the Clean Economy Investment Tax Credits in place to drive investment, “the government remains committed to sustainable forest management practices,” the document adds.

The Canadian Tree Nursery Association countered that tree planting should receive “major project status, not cuts”, after the country lost an estimated 8% of its forest cover to wildfires between 2023 and 2025.

“This abrupt move not only threatens the long-term environmental recovery of Canada’s forests—which have already been devastated by recent wildfires—but also jeopardizes the livelihoods of workers, critical infrastructure, and the entire forest restoration sector,” Executive Director Rob Keen said in a release.

A Foot in the Door for the Youth Climate Corps

The budget earmarks $40 million over two years to launch a Youth Climate Corps, in which young Canadians “will be trained to quickly respond to climate emergencies, support recovery, and strengthen resilience in communities across the country. The skills training and work experience opportunities created through a Youth Climate Corps support reducing youth unemployment, increasing innovation, and strengthening adaptation and mitigation projects.”

Climate champions received the news as a lone ray of hope after years of coast-to-coast advocacy to get the idea funded.

“This is a win for hundreds of young activists and allies who have pressed hard for this idea, especially in the context of a budget that is significantly retreating on climate and decreasing overall program spending,” Climate Emergency Unit Team Lead Seth Klein said in a release. “But notably, $20 million a year will only produce about 350 full-time jobs for the whole country, which is not terribly consequential for tackling skyrocketing youth unemployment or addressing the climate crisis.”

The budget allocation “is a far cry from the $1 billion annual investment our campaign has called for, but it gets our foot in the door to prove the YCC’s worth,” Klein added. “So we will roll up our sleeves and work with the government to up the ambition for a Youth Climate Corps that matches the generational challenge.”

In November 2023, polling commissioned by the Emergency Unit indicated that even 20,000 spots per year would barely scratch the surface of the potential demand for the program. Some 65% of youth aged 18-35 said they would consider joining, and 15% said they would “definitely” consider. Interest was highest on the Prairies and in Atlantic Canada, followed by Quebec.

With nine million people across the country in the 18-35 age group, the 15% figure added up to 1.3 million potential applicants, Klein noted.

“They’re not saying maybe. They’re saying ‘definitely. I get it. If this exists, sign me up’,” he said. “1.3 million Canadians are saying, ‘where’s my goddamn invitation?’”

A climate competitiveness strategy that sidestepped emission reduction mandates for fossil fuel producers and set the stage to repeal a hard-fought cap on the industry’s carbon pollution was a centrepiece of the federal budget released in November by Finance Minister François-Philippe Champagne.

The budget, titled Canada Strong, is the first produced by the government of Prime Minister Mark Carney. It reprises past promises to fast-track controversial new infrastructure projects, speed up new housing construction, and diversify the country’s trading relationships, increases military spending by $81.8 billion over five years, puts limits on the government’s commitments to sustainable finance and anti-greenwashing rules, and curtails the Trudeau government’s 2 Billion Trees program. It also lays out the broad lines of public service cutbacks that will slash $60 billion in federal spending and 40,000 jobs over five years, according to a memo issued Wednesday by the country’s top bureaucrat, Clerk of the Privy Council Michael Sabia.

Related: Nearly two dozen climate champions react to the budget in a live chat Tuesday evening hosted by The Energy Mix.

The budget places those changes in the context of the “profound transformation” sweeping the global economy.

“Industrial policy, once seen as secondary to market forces, is returning to the forefront,” the budget states. “In 2024 alone, governments worldwide introduced more than 2,500 industrial policy measures reflecting a transition in how governments are protecting national security interests and securing long-term competitiveness.”

In the United States, the Trump administration “is fundamentally reshaping all of its trading relationships and putting up trade barriers, with its average tariffs across all countries rising from around 2% at the end of 2024 to 17% today.” While the budget asserts repeatedly that Canada is faring better than other countries in its on-again, now off-again negotiations with the U.S., the impact of Trump’s tariff wars is still “profound—hurting companies, displacing workers, disrupting supply chains, and causing uncertainty that is curbing investment.”

As an antidote, the budget pitches an industrial strategy that pledges new infrastructure projects, public investment in research and development, lighter regulation, and tax deductions to trigger $500 billion in private sector investment over the next five years.

Competitiveness Over Climate?

The government’s climate competitiveness strategy was originally expected in mid- to late October, then delayed and folded into the budget announcement, prompting speculation that it wasn’t as fully defined as Carney had implied in his public statements. The published version cites climate action as an “economic necessity” as well as a “moral obligation”, at a time when “the world economy is undergoing a historic transformation towards low-carbon energy and clean technology.”

The document notes that global clean energy investments hit $2 trillion last year, nearly double the total poured into fossil fuels, and cites the Canadian Climate Institute’s warning that climate change will cut household incomes by nearly 20% by century’s end if it isn’t brought under control.

The strategy acknowledges that “buyers of Canada’s resources—oil and gas, steel, and aluminum—are increasingly looking for low-carbon sourcing.” It adds that “lowering our emissions is critical to protecting the competitiveness of Canada’s oil and gas and steel sectors. Reducing emissions is not only essential for environmental reasons, but also a key factor in securing access to markets that prioritize sustainability.”

But to meet that expectation, it sets sights on limiting the carbon intensity of Canadian industry—the emissions per barrel of oil or tonne of steel—rather than achieving actual reductions in climate pollution. In a sector like Canada’s oil sands, the difference matters—if production rises faster than emissions per barrel fall, the industry’s climate footprint will continue to grow. In September, the Climate Institute reported that the Canada’s progress on emissions flatlined in 2024, largely due to rising oil sands emissions, and the industry is planning on continuing production increases into the next decade.

The budget also:

• Allocates about $1 billion in tax incentives for “low-carbon liquefied natural gas facilities” that go into operation before 2030;

• Finalizes a clean electricity investment tax credit that was first introduced in the 2023 federal budget, but anticipates no spending at all through 2030;

• Extends the existing tax credit for carbon capture and storage by five years, to an end date of 2040 instead of 2035, but schedules no spending through 2030;

• Meets longstanding calls to expand the existing Scientific Research and Experimental Development (SR&ED) tax incentive system in ways that may disproportionately benefit early-stage clean technology companies;

• Cites the Darlington nuclear project outside Toronto, which will rely on uranium from the United States, as an example of “investing where it counts” in a new Buy Canada policy.

Trading Out the Emissions Cap

The budget stops short of eliminating the government’s watered-down, long-delayed cap on oil and gas emissions, but appears to trade it off for a stronger system of industrial carbon pricing and other measures meant to reduce the industry’s climate pollution.

The document says effective industrial carbon pricing is “essential to providing certainty to businesses looking to invest and compete internationally.” Already, it adds, that system “is expected to deliver more emission reductions than any other policy, with negligible impacts on affordability for Canadians.”

The budget pledges to “improve the effectiveness of carbon markets to provide confidence that credit prices will be predictable and sufficient to support clean growth investments without adversely affecting competitiveness or leading to carbon leakage.” Elements of that plan include:

• A multi-decade trajectory for industrial carbon pricing from 2030 through 2050, to be developed through engagement with provincial and territorial governments;

• Better federal benchmarks to ensure a consistent industrial carbon price across the country;

• Contracts for difference to give investors greater certainty about future carbon prices.

And to complement the industrial carbon price:

• Carrying on with the final, delayed version of federal Clean Electricity Regulations;

• Finalizing “enhanced” methane regulations for oil and gas operations and landfill sites, while allowing provincial and territorial governments to negotiate equivalency agreements based on their own control programs, with no reference in the document to serious, persistent problems in monitoring methane emissions;

• Future updates on electric vehicle mandates and clean fuel targets.

“Effective carbon markets, enhanced oil and gas methane regulations, and the deployment at scale of technologies such as carbon capture and storage would create the circumstances whereby the oil and gas emissions cap would no longer be needed as it would have marginal value in reducing emissions,” the budget states.

More New Homes, No Efficiency Target

The budget repeats Carney’s commitment of $13 billion over five years to launch the new Build Canada Homes agency and build up to 45,000 new housing units on existing federal lands. The program is meant to focus primarily on non-market housing and includes $423 million, already announced earlier this year, for eight new co-operative housing buildings.

Build Canada Homes aims to “catalyze maximum investment while mainstreaming advanced methods of construction, with the potential to cut building timelines by up to 50%, reduce costs by as much as 20%, and lower emissions by approximately 20% during construction,” the budget states. With that activity, “Canada can significantly increase its supply of affordable homes and become a global leader in housing innovation, including in construction techniques, sustainable materials, and leading-edge manufacturing.”

The budget makes no mention of energy efficiency or heat pump deployment targets for Build Canada Homes. Within 24 hours of the federal announcement, green building practitioners were worrying that the new units will become part of a huge backlog of homes awaiting energy retrofits to improve their performance and address heating and cooling costs that are an important factor in housing affordability.

Sustainable Finance Taxonomy: Target Date Set, Details Missing

The budget promises to complete its long-awaited sustainable finance taxonomy in 2026 and identify an arm’s length organization to develop sustainable investment guidelines by the end of this year. Canada’s taxonomy is an overdue response to a continuing international effort—in the field of finance, not biology—to set common definitions of sustainable investments that reduce emissions or support climate adaptation, and counter greenwashing around those activities.

“These investment guidelines will become an important, voluntary tool for investors, lenders, and other stakeholders navigating the global race to net-zero, by credibly identifying ‘green’ and ‘transition’ investments,” the budget states.

Those definitions have been the subject of fierce debate over more than three years, with some sustainable finance experts arguing it would be better to have no taxonomy at all than a system that allowed too much latitude for fossil fuel investment. Now, “the reconfirmed sustainable investment taxonomy, in moving forward, has to be fossil-free and centre independent experts outside of the financial sector. That’s foundational for it to be credible,” Julie Segal, senior program manager, climate finance at Environmental Defence Canada, said in an email.

“While it’s good that this government is paying attention to sustainable finance policies as it courts greater private sector investment, advancing solely on a taxonomy remains insufficient,” Segal added. “As Prime Minister Carney has said himself in previous roles, a cohesive package of mandatory transition plans, disclosure, and credible taxonomy is what’s needed. Until the full package of policies is delivered, it remains a missing piece of Canada’s climate plan.”

‘More Investor Risk’ with Weakened Greenwash Rules

The budget has also raised alarms by proposing to eliminate provisions in federal greenwashing legislation that require companies to verify environmental claims based on internationally recognized guidelines, and allow third parties to bring complaints to the federal Competition Tribunal.

In June, the Competition Bureau assured firms that the existing legislation, adopted by Parliament in June 2024, allows any marketing claims that aren’t false. But the budget still aims to offer “more certainty to the marketplace” by removing provisions that prompted fossil fuel companies and their lobby groups to not just update their websites, but burn them to the ground when the legislation was first adopted.

“The government’s proposal to weaken greenwashing provisions means more investor risk, particularly given the reluctance of provincial securities regulators to enforce accurate and complete disclosure in climate matters,” Matt Price, executive director of Investors for Paris Compliance, responded in a release.

“Removing the Competition Act amendments lets polluters mislead people in Canada and undermines truly sustainable businesses,” added the Canadian Association of Physicians for the Environment, one of the lead advocates for the legislation.

“Such needless retreat on climate and sustainable finance policy from a government led by Mark Carney is not something many experts would have expected,” said Adam Scott, executive director of Shift Action for Pension Wealth and Planet Health. “With the future stability and competitiveness of Canada’s economy on the line, we need much stronger leadership in the face of relentless industry lobbying. Canada needs credible guardrails in place to ensure the stability of our financial system and the climate.”

Cancelling the 2 Billion Trees Program

The budget signals a decision to wind down the Trudeau government’s commitment to plant two billion trees over 10 years, originally cast as “a significant step forward in Canada’s approach to tackle the dual crises of climate change and biodiversity loss.” Now, with nearly a billion trees committed, “existing contribution agreements and commitments will be honoured, and uncommitted funds will be returned,” the budget says.

With the Clean Economy Investment Tax Credits in place to drive investment, “the government remains committed to sustainable forest management practices,” the document adds.

The Canadian Tree Nursery Association countered that tree planting should receive “major project status, not cuts”, after the country lost an estimated 8% of its forest cover to wildfires between 2023 and 2025.

“This abrupt move not only threatens the long-term environmental recovery of Canada’s forests—which have already been devastated by recent wildfires—but also jeopardizes the livelihoods of workers, critical infrastructure, and the entire forest restoration sector,” Executive Director Rob Keen said in a release.

A Foot in the Door for the Youth Climate Corps

The budget earmarks $40 million over two years to launch a Youth Climate Corps, in which young Canadians “will be trained to quickly respond to climate emergencies, support recovery, and strengthen resilience in communities across the country. The skills training and work experience opportunities created through a Youth Climate Corps support reducing youth unemployment, increasing innovation, and strengthening adaptation and mitigation projects.”

Climate champions received the news as a lone ray of hope after years of coast-to-coast advocacy to get the idea funded.

“This is a win for hundreds of young activists and allies who have pressed hard for this idea, especially in the context of a budget that is significantly retreating on climate and decreasing overall program spending,” Climate Emergency Unit Team Lead Seth Klein said in a release. “But notably, $20 million a year will only produce about 350 full-time jobs for the whole country, which is not terribly consequential for tackling skyrocketing youth unemployment or addressing the climate crisis.”

The budget allocation “is a far cry from the $1 billion annual investment our campaign has called for, but it gets our foot in the door to prove the YCC’s worth,” Klein added. “So we will roll up our sleeves and work with the government to up the ambition for a Youth Climate Corps that matches the generational challenge.”

In November 2023, polling commissioned by the Emergency Unit indicated that even 20,000 spots per year would barely scratch the surface of the potential demand for the program. Some 65% of youth aged 18-35 said they would consider joining, and 15% said they would “definitely” consider. Interest was highest on the Prairies and in Atlantic Canada, followed by Quebec.

With nine million people across the country in the 18-35 age group, the 15% figure added up to 1.3 million potential applicants, Klein noted.

Potential problems with this bill Although passing this bill comes with some advantages, households might encounter some challenges in the future.","Inspecting your backup power at home might require a bit of patience. This is often because the city might be attending to a queue of people at the time, and you are probably behind a very long list. However, this might no longer be an issue following a recent government meeting.

The recently passed SB1252 and SB1202 bills.

Two Senate bills, Texas Senate Bill SB1252 and SB1202, were passed during the 89th Texas Legislative Session. But what are the benefits of these two bills? These two bills allow third-party professionals to inspect residential backup power systems in place of a city’s building department, also known as the Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ). But how exactly does this work?

The installer can choose to use either the local AHJ or a qualified third-party for plan review, inspection, or both. If a third-party is used, then the local codes must be requested from the AHJ. If the codes are not provided within two business days, the third-party would have to refer to the International Residential Code. As soon as the inspection is complete, the third party reaches out to AHJ and submits the documentation. The AHJ, however, has three witness days to issue the permit. Also, they don’t have the power to change the plan review for work done by a third party.

With this bill, projects can be done much more rapidly in just a few hours. Households no longer have to wait for city permitting offices for a long period of time. Also, it’s going to cost less to pay for these projects. This is because municipalities will not be able to request inspection fees for third-party reviews.

Why were these bills introduced?

One of the reasons why this bill was passed was to reduce the control cities have over energy projects. With third-party reviewers now available, local government no longer decides how quickly an application must be reviewed. Therefore, this makes cities have less influence over projects, giving more room for the third-party reviewers.

Potential problems with this bill

Although passing this bill comes with some advantages, households might encounter some challenges in the future. One of the biggest problems they might face is the low quality of inspection. A third-party might not follow due protocols like a city inspector, and this will lead to inconsistent application of safety standards. Also, because the third party is mostly hired and paid by the installer, they often give biased results just to keep their jobs. Therefore, they rush the inspection, give positive reviews, and approve plans quickly, even when things are not looking good.

Another major problem they might encounter is the work timeline. Normally, the city is often given three complete days to respond as soon as the documentation has been submitted. However, a third-party review has no set deadline and can take advantage of it. They might end up becoming lackadaisical and doing their job past the time households have set for them. Also, if a poorly reviewed system fails or is damaged, the households suffer the consequences, as they might not be covered by insurance, similar to this ground-breaking renewable energy project in New York.

What this bill means for the future of solar in Texas

By shifting responsibilities from the city to installers and households, the quality of services received depends on the choice made. This bill can be a gateway to faster and more affordable solar installation if the right decisions are made. And by removing long permitting delays, Texas is in a position to expand clean energy more quickly among users in the state. However, the success of this bill is heavily dependent on the reliability of the third-party guys to ensure that they provide the best quality of services to each household.",https://www.eldiario24.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/photo-1741188630852-e3151c41c80d.jpg,N,,2025-12-28 16:57:20.717953

Panaji : The Goa Energy Development Agency (GEDA) has started pushing for the implementation of the Clean Energy Roadmap for the State of Goa 2050, a long-term strategy to help the state switch over to 100 per cent clean and renewable energy and achieve economy-wide decarbonisation by 2050.

GEDA is working towards actionable programmes and on-ground implementation, in close association with stakeholders, said an official of the agency.

“We are working on many sectors like clean electricity and renewable energy supply, transport sector transformation, industry and commercial

buildings, agriculture, fisheries and rural energy use, clean cooking and household energy,” the official said.

The official said GEDA along with other agencies and with the support of the government is working toward transforming Goa into a low-carbon, climate-resilient and sustainable state by mid-century.

“Going beyond conventional power sector planning, the roadmap lays out an integrated, multi-sectoral approach to deep decarbonisation across all energy-consuming sectors of the economy,” the official explained.

The roadmap was launched in July 2023 on the G20 platform, and specific implementation workshops and broader promotion for the roadmap started later in October 2025.

“When we will achieve 100 per cent renewable energy usage across sectors by 2050 it will systematically reduce dependence on fossil fuels, promoting clean energy adoption and energy efficiency, and supporting economic growth,” the official reckoned.

The push will promote job creation and energy security and also help address climate change, the official said.

In the power sector, the roadmap sets out a transition to a fully renewable electricity system. This includes large-scale renewable energy projects and in-state generation such as rooftop solar, ground-mounted solar, floating solar, and other innovative solutions.

In transport, the document calls for rapid electrification of passenger vehicles and public transport. It also supports expanding electric mobility infrastructure and using biofuels and blended fuels for heavy transport and other hard-to-electrify uses.

For industry and commercial establishments, the roadmap focuses on the greater use of renewable electricity. It promotes energy-efficient technologies and switching from fossil fuels to cleaner alternatives.

In agriculture, fisheries, and rural livelihoods, the roadmap proposes solar-powered agricultural pumps. It also supports clean electricity and bioenergy solutions, and the use of biofuel blends in fishing and post-harvest activities.

The roadmap also prioritises clean cooking and household energy. It promotes biogas-based cooking systems and electric cooking powered by renewable energy.

The official also said the roadmap offers major investment opportunities in renewable energy that can create green and skilled jobs, grow local clean-energy industries, cut long-term energy costs and fuel imports, and strengthen energy security and climate flexibility.",https://navhindtimes.in/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/The-Navhind-Times-Featured-Default-1-1.png,N,,2025-12-28 18:57:53.768582

These secondary minerals are not the main target of mining operations, so they are often separated out and discarded during processing. According to the researchers, recovering even small amounts of these overlooked materials could have a major impact on U.S. supply chains.

The researchers found that if 90 percent of these byproducts were recovered, they ""could meet nearly all U.S. critical mineral needs; one percent recovery would substantially reduce import reliance for most elements evaluated."" This means that even modest improvements in recovery technology could significantly reduce dependence on overseas sources.

What Are Critical Minerals and Why They Matter

Critical minerals are materials that are essential to the economy and national security but face supply risks due to limited domestic production or geopolitical instability. In the United States, this category includes minerals such as cobalt, nickel, manganese, lithium, tellurium, germanium, and many others.

These elements play key roles in modern technology. They are used in rechargeable batteries for electric vehicles, magnets for wind turbines, semiconductors for electronics, and solar panels for renewable energy. Some are also vital for defense systems, medical devices, and communications equipment.

Demand for these materials is growing rapidly as clean energy technologies expand. At the same time, many critical minerals are currently imported from regions affected by political tension or trade uncertainty. Developing entirely new mines can take decades, making alternative domestic sources especially attractive.

How Researchers Measured Untapped Mineral Potential

To estimate how much of these minerals could be recovered inside the United States, Holley and her colleagues combined two large datasets. One database tracked the main commodities produced at federally permitted U.S. metal mines. The other included detailed geochemical measurements showing the concentrations of 70 critical minerals found in ore samples across the country.

By pairing production data with mineral chemistry data, the team was able to estimate how much of each critical mineral is already being mined and processed, but not recovered. Instead, these materials end up in mine waste, also known as tailings, which must be stored and monitored to prevent environmental harm.

In many cases, the study found that recovering less than 10 percent of these byproducts would generate a higher total dollar value than the primary metals currently being sold by U.S. mines. This suggests that what is treated as waste today could become a major economic resource.

Economic, Strategic, and Environmental Benefits

The potential benefits of recovering critical mineral byproducts extend beyond economics. Reducing import dependence would strengthen supply security for industries tied to energy, technology, and defense. It could also help protect the U.S. from supply disruptions caused by international conflicts or trade restrictions.

There are environmental advantages as well. Recovering valuable minerals instead of discarding them would reduce the volume and long term impact of mine waste. It could also create new opportunities to reuse processed materials in construction and other applications.

Despite the promise, challenges remain. Recovering small amounts of minerals from complex ore mixtures requires advanced technology, additional processing steps, and supportive policies. As Holley has explained, the difficulty lies in making recovery practical and cost effective at scale.

Still, the findings point to a largely untapped opportunity. Active U.S. mines are already handling the materials needed for batteries, clean energy systems, and high tech manufacturing. With targeted investment, research, and policy incentives, these hidden byproducts could become a powerful domestic resource rather than a discarded one.",https://www.sciencedaily.com/images/1920/colorado-climax-mine.webp,N,,2025-12-28 14:57:34.398091

The United States has been developing a new foundation to advance the nuclear energy market through several projects and initiatives that were mandated by the current administration. It would appear that New Jersey is the latest state to plan a substantial investment to revive the US nuclear energy market.

New Jersey has passed new legislation regarding the revival of the US nuclear market

New Jersey recently passed the latest legislation that incentivises operators to develop new nuclear energy projects in the Garden State. The bill, known as the New Jersey Energy Security and Affordability Act, cleared the Senate Environment and Energy Committee easily.

The proposed legislation would promote the development of the nuclear energy sector in the state through several new initiatives, such as:

The Act will direct New Jersey’s Board of Public Utilities (BPU) to establish an Advanced Nuclear Development Fund that will require New Jersey rate payers to subsidise construction of 1,200 megawatts of power at the very least from qualifying nuclear generation projects in the Garden State.

The Act will require the state to establish an Advanced Nuclear Energy Certificate (ANEC) program, which will require basic generation service (BGS) providers and electric power suppliers to purchase new certificates generated by qualified nuclear projects in New Jersey.

The new proposed Advanced Nuclear Energy Certificate (ANEC) program will aim to promote the nuclear energy sector advancement by mandating that basic electricity providers in New Jersey deliver a percentage of kilowatt hours from nuclear energy produced in New Jersey.

The aim of the bill is to promote the use of nuclear energy in New Jersey as energy providers and utilities develop new nuclear projects that meet the state requirements to qualify for the new incentivised initiative, potentially transforming New Jersey into a hub for the nuclear energy revival in the United States.

The United States is fostering a new era of clean energy production from the nuclear sector

While the federal government rolls back wind energy project permits, the new Act aims to develop an investment framework for the nuclear energy market in New Jersey. A concern has been raised by rate payers organizations as the bill allows for basic electricity providers to pass on the costs to rate payers in the Garden State.

Any qualified nuclear energy project in the state may receive Advanced Nuclear Energy Certificates for each kilowatt of nuclear energy produced and sold in the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland (PJM) region. However, any power sold out of state may not receive the accreditation.

As Los Angeles has developed the first-ever hydrogen-ready power plant, New Jersey is aiming to become a hub for the nuclear energy revival in the United States. Through the new bill that has passed muster with state lawmakers, New Jersey is one step closer to its ambitions being realised.

“There is no question we need an energy policy overhaul in America. A key part of that overhaul must include moving forward aggressively with expanding nuclear energy as a renewable energy source.” – Erik Paulsen

The US is entering a new era of nuclear energy generation

The new bill in New Jersey is just the latest initiative proposed to advance the nuclear energy revival in the United States. The US Energy Department has reported that the progress of increasing nuclear energy generation is picking up traction, as it has selected 11 potential advanced reactor demonstration projects that will position the US as the market leader in nuclear energy generation across the international energy market. Nuclear energy is making a triumphant comeback in the US.

The California Energy Commission recently approved over $40 million in grants to ""improve waterfront facilities at state ports for floating offshore wind projects,"" Riviera reported.

The funding will be divided among several projects, including pier evaluations and planning efforts at Port of Long Beach, upgrades to Humboldt Bay Harbor's offshore wind terminal, and the development of a wind terminal at the Port of San Luis Harbor, according to Riviera.

These infrastructure initiatives will accelerate California's transition to renewable energy sources and support the state's goal of complete carbon neutrality by 2045. The construction, support, and maintenance of the new and improved wind hubs will also create thousands of jobs.

Adam Stern, executive director of Offshore Wind California, said the grant approval is ""good news for Californian workers and residents who will benefit from gigawatts of reliable, clean offshore wind power. These grants … are a welcome milestone for deploying floating turbines 32-48 km off California's coast,"" per Riviera.

Besides creating jobs and increasing energy security, wind power offers environmental benefits, like improving air quality and preserving natural resources. The most significant environmental benefit of wind power and other forms of renewable energy is the reduced reliance on finite dirty fuels.

Burning fossil fuels, which include coal, oil, and gas, releases planet-warming gases like carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide. The resulting air pollution is responsible for millions of premature deaths each year.

For California residents, these projects will increase homeowners' access to reliable, safe, clean electricity. The plan is to produce 148,000 megawatts of energy through renewable means — enough to power 25 million homes.

The state is making great progress. In 2024, California's solar, wind, and water produced enough power to meet the state's electricity demand for nearly 100 days.

These projects are a significant stepping stone in California's commitment to clean energy.

""California is demonstrating its continued determination to be a clean-energy leader, despite federal headwinds,"" Stern stressed. ""This action is another important proof point of California's progress and commitment to move forward on offshore wind — to strengthen its energy security and independence, spur a hub for floating technology and jobs, and help secure the state's path to 100% clean electricity by 2045.""",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/vKTEsHwBdVCA5V9F9Bqw2A--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02ODA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_cool_down_737/d055eb3a04fbaa303becdb93b9a94a3f,N,,2025-12-28 14:57:40.561321

This month, the automaker scrapped not one but two major EV battery deals: an $11.4 billion joint venture with South Korea’s SK On, and a $6.5 billion supply agreement with LG Energy Solution.

While it’s tapping the brakes on its EV ambitions for the time being, Ford is putting more weight behind a different kind of battery, the kind built to power entire grids.

Read: Ford Kills Major Battery Deal As EV Plans Rapidly Unravel

The company signed a licensing deal in 2023 with Chinese battery heavyweight CATL to use its lithium iron phosphate (LFP) technology. The original plan was to manufacture EV batteries using CATL’s chemistry, bringing production in-house with a technical edge from one of the world’s largest battery makers. That plan has changed.

Shifting Power to the Grid

Instead of funneling CATL’s LFP chemistry into cars, Ford will now use it to produce large-format batteries designed for energy storage. These units, built at scale, are intended for use by utilities and grid operators.

“Given the fact that we already had a license to build that technology in the US, you couple that with our manufacturing experience, over a century of high-scale manufacturing, it just made a lot of sense as a natural adjacency for us,” Ford vice president of technology platform programs and EV systems, Lisa Drake told Bloomberg.

Ford has had to walk through a political minefield to bring its deal with CATL to life. Virginia’s Governor rejected Ford’s plans to build a battery plant there using CATL technology due to its Chinese ties. Ford is now building its plant in Michigan and expects to open it next year.

As the Trump administration pushes to reduce America’s reliance on Chinese products, Ford believes its approach is better than continuing to import the Chinese-made batteries that have already become common in the U.S. energy sector.

The Case for Building at Home

“Given the ongoing needs of US energy producers, it seems like a no-brainer to support efforts to produce batteries in America instead of importing more of them from China,” Ford added.

The carmaker has also revealed that it spoke with potential customers to see if there was demand for it to sell energy storage cells. It “received resounding affirmation.” Not only are LFP cells great for EVs, but they’re also well-suited for energy storage, hence why Ford’s move makes sense.",https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Ford-Factory-j-copy.jpg,N,,2025-12-28 14:57:27.324955

“Don’t buy the lie that clean energy is expensive,” he said.
“Making electric heat technologies more affordable lets more facilities swap out dirty fossil fuel boilers for clean electric options.” Energy efficiency upgrades, meanwhile, are a no-brainer according to the duo.","In a virtual launch on December 16, UC Santa Barbara’s 2035 Initiative unveiled a detailed roadmap for a seemingly obvious target of climate action: cleaning up the industrial sector.

Titled The Clean Heat Climate Opportunity, the new report maps out a pathway for electrifying low- and medium-temperature industrial heat — the kind used in making everything from paper and plastics to beer and frozen pizza. And the findings are clear: This shift could slash U.S. climate pollution by as much as 26 percent in key sectors while unlocking nearly half a trillion dollars in public health benefits by 2050.

“To hit our climate goals, it’s not just cars and buildings that need to go electric — it’s also big factories,” said Leah C. Stokes, one of the report’s principal investigators and an Associate Professor at UCSB. “Most of what we eat, drink, and use every day gets made with heat from burning fossil fuels. Fortunately, we can swap out dirty technologies with clean alternatives like electric heat pumps that can cut pollution, improve air quality, and modernize U.S. manufacturing.”

As stated early on in the presentation, industrial operations account for roughly a quarter of America’s greenhouse gas emissions, and the U.S. is second only to China as the world’s largest emitter.

Enter the 2035 Initiative, UCSB’s own “think-and-do tank,” which blends engineering models, public policy research, and on-the-ground engagement to accelerate climate solutions. This particular project was co-led as principal investigators by Stokes and Professor Eric Masanet, who holds the Mellichamp Chair in Sustainability Science for Emerging Technologies.

“The industrial sector is complex, which often makes smart policy hard to design,” Masanet said. “Our engineering models cut through that complexity to pinpoint opportunities that are both realistic and actionable in real-world plants.”

According to the report, electrifying heat processes in three energy-intensive sectors — chemicals, pulp and paper, and food and beverage — could cut cumulative emissions by 930 to 1,320 million metric tons of CO₂-equivalent through 2050. That’s up to 26 percent of the climate pollution from major facilities in these sectors.

And there is financial incentive. The analysis estimates $288 billion to $475 billion in avoided public health costs from reduced air pollutants like nitrogen oxides and fine particulate matter. These emissions are linked to respiratory illness, heart disease, and cancer.

“These programs are the future of our country,” said Senator Martin Heinrich (D-NM), who spoke during the launch event alongside Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI). “People want hot showers and cold beer — same approach to the industrial sector.” Heinrich expanded that to mean that we can get the same output with a cleaner, and more cost-effective, setup.

Whitehouse didn’t mince words about the stakes. “Don’t buy the lie that clean energy is expensive,” he said. “The Trump administration lies about the cost.”

The report lands at a time when federal climate policy is being sharply reversed. Since returning to office, President Trump has cut billions from key clean energy programs, including the $7 billion “Solar for All” initiative aimed at low-income households, and canceled hundreds of Department of Energy awards that had supported battery production, hydrogen hubs, and EV manufacturing. The administration has also paused new approvals for wind energy — including offshore — while ramping up fossil fuel development on federal lands. Lawsuits challenging these moves are now playing out in courts across the country.

“States can unlock progress on industrial electrification today,” said Stokes. “Making electric heat technologies more affordable lets more facilities swap out dirty fossil fuel boilers for clean electric options.”

Energy efficiency upgrades, meanwhile, are a no-brainer according to the duo. Measures like steam system optimization and process controls can shrink electricity demand while boosting savings for businesses.

This work is part of a growing portfolio at the 2035 Initiative, which is also developing global climate opinion maps, working on grid resilience for vulnerable communities, and tracking climate concern in small island nations.

Though headquartered on UCSB’s campus, the Initiative’s work aims to reach Washington, D.C. “This roadmap is meant to show policymakers where the low-hanging fruit is,” Stokes said. “There are facilities across the country that should start looking at swapping out their fossil fuels ASAP because it might save them money.”",https://www.independent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image-32-Large.jpeg?fit=1200%2C514,N,,2025-12-28 13:58:08.176307

Tesla's expansion into commercial EV charging solutions, such as the recently highlighted commercial wall connector, represents a significant stride in integrating artificial intelligence with sustainable energy infrastructure. According to reports from Electrek in late 2023, Tesla has been enhancing its charging hardware to support fleet operations and business environments, building on its AI-driven ecosystem that optimizes energy distribution. This development aligns with broader AI trends in the electric vehicle sector, where machine learning algorithms are employed to manage charging schedules, predict energy demands, and integrate with smart grids. For instance, Tesla's AI systems, as detailed in their 2022 AI Day presentation, utilize neural networks to analyze real-time data from vehicles and chargers, enabling dynamic load balancing that reduces peak-hour strain on electrical grids. In the industry context, this comes at a time when global EV adoption is surging; data from the International Energy Agency's 2023 report indicates that electric car sales exceeded 10 million units in 2022, with projections for 14 million in 2023, driving demand for intelligent charging solutions. Tesla's commercial wall connector, capable of delivering up to 48 amps of power, incorporates AI features like over-the-air updates and integration with the Tesla app, which uses predictive analytics to suggest optimal charging times based on user behavior and energy prices. This not only enhances efficiency but also positions Tesla as a leader in the AI-enhanced energy management space, competing with companies like ChargePoint and EVgo. Moreover, ethical implications arise in ensuring data privacy for commercial users, with Tesla adhering to best practices outlined in the 2021 California Consumer Privacy Act regulations. The implementation challenges include scalability in urban areas with limited grid capacity, but solutions like AI-optimized vehicle-to-grid technology, as explored in a 2023 study by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, offer pathways to mitigate these issues. Looking ahead, this could catalyze market opportunities in commercial real estate, where AI-driven charging infrastructure boosts property values by up to 15 percent, according to a 2023 CBRE report on sustainable buildings.

From a business perspective, Tesla's commercial wall connector opens up lucrative market opportunities in the burgeoning EV infrastructure sector, projected to reach $100 billion globally by 2030, as per a 2023 BloombergNEF analysis. Companies can monetize this through subscription-based AI analytics services that provide insights into energy usage patterns, enabling cost savings of up to 20 percent on electricity bills, based on Tesla's 2022 pilot programs with commercial fleets. The competitive landscape features key players like ABB and Siemens, but Tesla's edge lies in its integrated AI ecosystem, including the Dojo supercomputer announced in 2021, which trains models for predictive maintenance on charging equipment.

Businesses implementing these connectors face challenges such as high initial costs, averaging $1,000 per unit as of 2023 pricing, but solutions include financing models and government incentives from the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, offering tax credits up to 30 percent for commercial EV infrastructure. Ethical best practices involve transparent AI decision-making to avoid biases in energy allocation, as recommended by the AI Now Institute's 2023 report. Future implications point to expanded monetization strategies, like partnering with utilities for demand-response programs, potentially generating additional revenue streams estimated at $5 billion annually for the sector by 2025, according to McKinsey's 2023 energy outlook. In terms of industry impact, this trend accelerates the shift towards AI-optimized logistics for e-commerce giants like Amazon, which reported integrating similar tech in 2023 to reduce fleet downtime by 25 percent. Overall, Tesla's move underscores how AI can transform business operations, fostering innovation in sustainable transport and creating new job opportunities in AI engineering, with the sector expected to add 97 million jobs by 2025, per the World Economic Forum's 2020 Future of Jobs report updated in 2023.

Technically, the commercial wall connector leverages Tesla's advanced AI frameworks, including computer vision and reinforcement learning, to enable features like automatic fault detection, as demonstrated in their 2023 software updates. Implementation considerations include integrating with existing building management systems, where challenges like interoperability are addressed through APIs compatible with standards from the Open Charge Point Protocol version 2.0, released in 2018 and updated in 2022. Future outlook suggests AI advancements could lead to fully autonomous charging networks by 2027, with predictive models improving efficiency by 30 percent, based on a 2023 Gartner forecast. Specific data from Tesla's Q3 2023 earnings call reveals that their energy storage deployments grew 90 percent year-over-year, highlighting the role of AI in scaling operations. For businesses, this means opportunities in data-driven decision-making, but also the need for robust training datasets to avoid errors, as seen in a 2023 MIT study on AI reliability in energy systems. Regulatory compliance involves adhering to FCC standards for wireless connectivity in chargers, updated in 2022. Ethically, promoting inclusive AI design ensures accessibility for diverse commercial users. In summary, this positions Tesla at the forefront of AI innovation in energy, with potential for cross-industry applications in smart cities.

The state has attracted an estimated $25 to $30 billion in EV-related investment, far more than any other Midwest state, supported by the nation’s deepest automotive supplier base and decades of R&D expertise.
Programs such as Michigan’s Supplier Conversion Grants aim to help traditional auto suppliers pivot toward EV and battery components rather than exit the market.
Ohio’s model offers a contrast: fewer OEMs, fewer suppliers, but clearer alignment between manufacturing, batteries, and workforce retraining.
For Ohio, it means proving a focused EV hub can scale beyond one automaker.","COLUMBUS — Honda’s transformation of Ohio into its primary North American EV hub underscores an intensifying competition across the Midwest — one that puts Michigan’s long-held automotive dominance under pressure, even as the state continues to pour billions into electric vehicle development.

Honda is investing $700 million to retool three Ohio plants and partnering with LG Energy Solution on a $3.5 billion battery facility, positioning Ohio as a focused, vertically aligned EV manufacturing center with production slated to begin in late 2025. The strategy mirrors a broader industry shift toward fewer, more centralized EV hubs as automakers manage slower-than-expected consumer adoption.

Michigan, by contrast, is pursuing a scale-and-ecosystem strategy.

The state has attracted an estimated $25 to $30 billion in EV-related investment, far more than any other Midwest state, supported by the nation’s deepest automotive supplier base and decades of R&D expertise. Programs such as Michigan’s Supplier Conversion Grants aim to help traditional auto suppliers pivot toward EV and battery components rather than exit the market.

But Michigan’s advantage comes with complexity.

Unlike Ohio’s Honda-centered approach, Michigan’s EV footprint is spread across multiple OEMs — GM, Ford, and Stellantis — each adjusting timelines and production plans amid shifting federal policy and market demand. Several high-profile projects have been delayed or scaled back, fueling debate over incentives, land use, and community acceptance.

Still, Michigan remains the center of gravity for Midwest mobility.

The state’s supplier density, engineering workforce, testing facilities, and charging infrastructure goals — including a plan to deploy 100,000 EV chargers by 2030 — give it structural advantages competitors struggle to replicate. More than 27% of Michigan’s economy remains tied to automotive and mobility industries, anchoring its long-term relevance even as EV growth slows.

Ohio’s model offers a contrast: fewer OEMs, fewer suppliers, but clearer alignment between manufacturing, batteries, and workforce retraining. Indiana and Illinois occupy middle ground, with Indiana leaning on cost competitiveness and Illinois relying heavily on Rivian as a single EV anchor.

Industry analysts say the Midwest’s EV race is entering a second phase — less about announcements and more about execution.

“The early EV boom was about who could land the biggest press release,” said one Midwest auto analyst. “The next phase is about who can actually build profitably, train workers, and survive slower adoption.”

For Michigan, that means translating its massive ecosystem into durable EV production — not just investment commitments. For Ohio, it means proving a focused EV hub can scale beyond one automaker.

Either way, the Midwest remains central to America’s EV future — but the balance of power inside the region is still very much in flux.",https://mitechnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Michigan-EV-workforce-map-overview.jpg,N,,2025-12-28 11:58:48.909548

Global green bond and loan issuance has reached a record $947 billion so far this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence. That's as stock market gauges for renewables are set for their first annual gains since 2020, outperforming the S&P 500 by a wide margin, while shares of power-grid technology companies remain in favor.

The flows are notable in a year when US President Donald Trump backed fossil fuels and dismantled clean-energy subsidies and legislation. Europe also has rolled back some of its toughest environmental rules amid concerns about growth and competitiveness.

Still, clearer policy signals and an almost 4% expected increase in global electricity demand, driven by AI, cooling and electrification needs, are lifting investor optimism.

""Green investments are increasingly becoming viewed as core infrastructure and industrial plays, not just niche ESG trades,"" said Melissa Cheok, associate director for ESG investment research at Sustainable Fitch. ""Capital is likely flowing toward areas with clear revenue visibility, policy backing and structural demand such as grid upgrades and renewables tied to electrification.""

Asia-Pacific companies and government-linked issuers raised $261 billion from green debt, up about 20% from a year earlier, with China and India backing the rollout of renewables, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. China had a record $138 billion in green bond issuance, led by its biggest lenders. It also debuted a sovereign offering in London earlier this year.

The so-called greenium - the lower borrowing costs on green bonds - is most evident in Asia-Pacific, with some issuers getting more than a 14-basis-point discount for using a green label in November, according to BloombergNEF. Green bonds are often used by companies to raise money for switching to renewable energy or lower-carbon transportation.

BNP Paribas SA and Credit Agricole SA are this year's leading underwriters of green bonds, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The amount of outstanding green bonds has grown at a 30% compound annual rate over the past five years and issuance now accounts for about 4.3% of the global total, LSE Group researchers said last month.

Easing US interest rates and refinancing needs may boost global green bond sales to as much as $1.6 trillion next year, said Crystal Geng, environmental, social and governance research lead for Asia at BNP Paribas Asset Management.

Green stocks have been a market leader this year. Clean-energy indexes from S&P Dow Jones Indices and WilderShares have surged 45% and 60%, respectively, though both remain below their 2021 peaks.

US solar and battery storage stocks, including SolarEdge Technologies Inc., have been among the top performers, while wind turbine makers have led gains in China and Germany. India has emerged as a hotspot for renewable-energy initial public offerings, with 11 listings raising more than $1 billion and another six companies seeking more than $3 billion. Last year, 14 renewable energy companies raised $2.4 billion through IPOs.

Not all markets are benefiting. US green debt issuance fell 7% to $163 billion this year and supranational bond sales declined by a similar amount. Fundraising in Germany was steady at roughly $79 billion.

While India saw record green loan volumes of $7 billion, strong interest from foreign banks has intensified competition, squeezing financing margins by 5% to 10% on renewable energy and other projects, said Jeanne Soh, head of structured finance for Asia at Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp.

Sales of sustainability-linked debt slumped about 50% this year to $165 billion amid greenwashing concerns, Bloomberg Intelligence data show. Transition bond issuance more than halved to $10.9 billion for hard-to-abate sectors.

The trends are likely to reverse over the next two years, said Xuan Sheng Ou Yong, a client portfolio manager for sustainable investing at Robeco in Singapore. Changes to European fund rules will let asset managers define what qualifies as a sustainable investment, opening the door to emissions-cutting investments in higher-polluting sectors, he said.

Overall, global sustainable debt volumes stood at about $1.6 trillion this year, down more than 8% from 2024, the Bloomberg Intelligence data show. Separately, more than $500 billion of social bonds were sold in the US tied to the Government National Mortgage Association, known as Ginnie Mae, which guarantees principal and interest on mortgage-backed securities.

The move will see the company shift US EV battery production lines to ESS output ahead of 2027.
“It is a significant opportunity for Samsung SDI to expand into the US ESS market with the first long-term contract for LFP supply,” said a Samsung official.

Each Samsung Battery Box (SBB) unit is packaged into a standard 20-foot container that incorporates a number of battery racks, battery management systems, and thermal management systems (both cooling and fire safety) for quick, easy deployment.","In what appears to be significant strategic pivot, Samsung SDI will begin supplying prismatic lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries for energy storage systems under a fresh US contract worth more than 2 trillion won (~$1.35 billion). The move will see the company shift US EV battery production lines to ESS output ahead of 2027.

Michigan-based Samsung SDI America will begin manufacturing battery energy storage system (BESS) cells at the company’s Indiana facility, where the manufacturer has been shifting some its production lines from cell production for EVs to prismatic LFP cell production for BESS units – a move the company claims will allow it to more closely align with domestic market demands.

“It is a significant opportunity for Samsung SDI to expand into the US ESS market with the first long-term contract for LFP supply,” said a Samsung official. “Through the first supply of SBB 2.0 for ESS installation in the US, Samsung SDI will start providing US customers with ESS batteries to meet their needs not only for high-performance but also for enhanced safety and price competitiveness, enabling them to stabilize power supplies in the era of renewable energy and AI.”

What’s in the box

Prismatic LFPs are encased in rigid aluminum housings that give them greater resistance to external shocks and impact damage, while promising lower heat and improved thermal safety compared to more familiar, pouch format cells. That construction, along with other proprietary anti-thermal propagation (read: fire safety) designs that limit heat spread between cells, make prismatic LFPs an attractive option for utility-scale BESS deployments where fire risk and system reliability are top priorities for utilities and data centers.

Each Samsung Battery Box (SBB) unit is packaged into a standard 20-foot container that incorporates a number of battery racks, battery management systems, and thermal management systems (both cooling and fire safety) for quick, easy deployment.

The company also pointed out that Samsung SDI is regarded as the only non-Chinese manufacturer of prismatic batteries currently operating in the US, a position the company believes strengthens its competitive standing as it expands its presence in North America.

Electrek’s Take

Samsung kicked off the launch of its SSB 2.0 at RE+ earlier this year with the words, “All-American, Proven, and Ready,” emphasizing the company’s role as a creator of American jobs with statements like, “Samsung SDI aims to strengthen competitiveness in the US market …” which reads, to me, like the company is trying to ride a wave of Sinophobia as it positions itself for leadership in the data center BESS market, just as the big Chinese and American tech players continue to separate from one another.

The only problem I see there is that the kind of American voters who buy into that particular brand of anti-China propaganda probably can’t tell the difference between China and Korea. Change my mind, in the comments.

Japan has set a ‘linear pathway’ to achieving its 2035 climate goals, but reliance on fossil fuels remains an obstacle. This is why Japan is turning to America for hydrogen, hoping that a 15-year, 500,000-ton bet will help the country move past coal and gas as primary fuels for power. Discover how these two countries’ collaboration will help Japan go green.

Japan is seeking greener pastures with a 15-year, 500,000-ton bet

Just like the world, Japan is also seeking greener pastures, especially as the deadline for its climate goals is looming around the corner. The country is aiming to achieve the following:

A 60% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared to 2013 levels by 2035, and

By 2040, a 73% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared to 2013 levels

Convinced that these specific goals will help the country meet the global mission of achieving net-zero by 2050, Japan is now actively investing in alternative fuels and energies to decrease its coal and gas dependency. According to Reuters, over 50% of Japan’s power was generated by fossil fuels during 2024/2025, of which coal and gas were the primary sources.

Fortunately, Japan is turning to America for hydrogen in its venture to greener pastures, which will play a significant role in the country’s transition away from fossil fuels.

Japan turns to America for hydrogen

All eyes have been on Japan since the 2025 Japan Summit & Exhibition, where Japan’s Energy for a New Era (JERA) hinted at new LNG Agreements.

The biggest power-producing company in Japan, JERA, has made a 15-year government-supported bet on ammonia imports from America. This subsidy will help cover the difference between coal and ammonia expenses, as imports are planned to commence by 2029. Earlier this year, JERA partnered with CF Industries and Mitsui for the Blue Point project.

The Blue Point project is a nearly $4 billion project, which will boast one of the biggest low-carbon ammonia facilities in the world. The Blue Point project is situated in Louisiana, and Mitsui will be responsible for supplying the project’s partners, which is planned to commence by 2030. The project will provide 280,000 tons of ammonia each year to the following partners (among others):

Hokkaido Electric Power

Mitsubishi UBE Cement

Tosoh

This is how Japan will benefit from U.S. imports

JERA itself plans on benefitting from nearly 500,000 tons annually from the Blue Point project, as ammonia and hydrogen are key to the country’s venture into greener pastures. According to Anri Nakamura, principal hydrogen research analyst at S&P Global Energy Horizons, the decision is an exciting development for the country’s hydrogen policy, which has remained quiet until now. Nakamura added:

“These agreements also strengthen ammonia cofiring plans at power plants supported by long-term decarbonized power auctions. While burning ammonia in coal plants is costly, we expect this volume can be supported by the CFD budget, especially if higher-value industrial applications are also developed.”

According to a JERA spokesperson, the ammonia imports will be extremely vital for Japan, as JERA will commence 20% ammonia cofiring at the 1 GW No. 4 Hekinan coal-fired unit starting 2029/2030. The ammonia will also be used at the Tomata-Atsume thermal power plant, as well as a fuel for Mitsubishi UBE Cement. Tosoh will use it as raw material.

This project is only the first step towards Japan’s better, greener future, a step that will significantly lower the country’s carbon footprint while helping it achieve its climate goals in no time. Ammonia is exceptional as a low-carbon fuel or feedstock, which is most likely why Japan has also been focusing on ammonia-powered ship engines. The country has completed its first factory trials, proving how valuable its U.S. ammonia import investment is for the future.

We’ll be back to our regular schedule in the new year.

Energy and Natural Resources Minister Tim Hodgson drew praise from fossil industry supporters in August and set off alarm bells in the climate community with his statement that there’s sure to be a market for new Canadian liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports, in spite of a looming global gas glut.

“I know there are buyers,” Hodgson told CTV host Vassy Kapelos last week.

“Our production is much closer to Asian markets. Our production is much cleaner than the American in terms of carbon footprint,” he said. “And what I can tell you from the conversations that the prime minister has been having, the minister of foreign affairs has been having, the minister of international trade has been having, the conversations I’ve been having, our allies are very interested in Canadian LNG.”

Canadians can “expect to see projects announced in the early fall,” Hodgson added, via a “rolling set of announcements” as proponents pitch projects that respond to the five criteria set out in the government’s controversial major projects legislation.

“More customers, more shipments, more LNG export facilities, means more jobs for Canadians, more opportunities for Indigenous partnerships, and certainly a more economically secure country,” responded Lisa Baiton, president and CEO of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, notwithstanding staunch opposition emerging from many Indigenous organizations and communities.

CTV recounts a long exchange in which Kapelos tried to pin Hodgson down on whether the government will abandon its emission reduction targets or environmental assessment rules to get LNG projects done. Hodgson maintained Canadians should “be proud” that its LNG has the “lowest carbon footprint of any produced in the world.” But Canadian Climate Institute principal economist Dave Sawyer said even that “cleaner” LNG will still produce “a lot of emission,” so that “the math is inescapable.”

“The challenge has always been to balance out economic growth, and really, emission-intensive resource growth, with policy that sort of bends the emission curve down,” he told CTV. “And when you’re putting in these big, large, lumpy emission projects, you need some pretty strong policy to counter the emissions.”

The government’s initial list of “nation-building” megaprojects doesn’t include LNG. But that didn’t stop Alberta Energy and Minerals Minister Brian Jean from praising the statement on his Facebook page.

“Excited to see these approvals move forward!” Jean wrote. “Alberta is ready to seize new opportunities and help Canada reach its full potential as a true energy superpower.”

Calgary Herald columnist Chris Varcoe says Hodgson’s remarks rippled through the fossil industry “like a stone skipping across calm water.”

“The fact we’re hearing that from our own government now, the federal government, is a very positive sign. It’s a long way from, ‘There’s no business case for LNG,’ which we heard from the previous government,” said Peyto Exploration and Development CEO Jean-Paul Lachance. “That gives me some confidence that there’s going to be some support for LNG projects within Canada… It sends the right signal to the capital markets that we’re open for business here.”

“People in other countries have been waiting to hear the federal government of Canada speak in this way,” Shannon Joseph, chair of Energy for a Secure Future, told Varcoe.

But others were listening, too. “Minister Hodgson believes there is an international appetite for LNG—but with a global gas glut looming, this could not be further from the truth,” Climate Action Network Canada Executive Director Caroline Brouillette said in a statement. “The Minister should be focusing exclusively on the projects with the highest likelihood of success—ones that are based on inexpensive technologies and that will make our country resilient in the long run. Renewable energy, storage, and electricity transmission projects are all no-brainers.”

Investors for Paris Compliance Executive Director Matt Price had a more visceral take on Hodgson’s remarks.

“Our son just got home from fighting the 588-hectare Cameron Lake fire, only to hear about the new 1,391-hectare (and growing) fire south of Port Alberni,” he wrote last week on LinkedIn. “And we’re still talking about new fossil fuel infrastructure?”

Last week, Hodgson was back in the news announcing $13.2 million in funding for five new smart projects in Mississauga, Toronto, Waterloo, and M’Chigeeng, on Manitoulin Island. Today, he’s scheduled for an announcement at the Bruce nuclear station near Tiverton.

We’ll be back to our regular schedule in the new year.

Fossil fuel employment has fallen to less than 1% of the Canadian work force, while growth in global energy jobs outpaced the wider economy for the third year in a row, according to two back-to-back reports released earlier in the year.

In Canada, the fossil industry has dropped 38,000 jobs in the last five years, mostly in upstream oil and gas, even though production increased 35% for oil and 24% for natural gas over that period, the Centre for Future Work reported Monday.

“This long-term decline is set to continue for many reasons, not solely or mostly climate policy. New technologies, economic forces, resource depletion, and corporate outsourcing strategies are all eliminating fossil fuel jobs,” the Vancouver-based organization said in a release. The 95-page report concludes [pdf] that:

• The job transition out of fossil fuels is taking place in spite of any efforts in national climate policy, not because of them.

• The pace of the decline is consistent with a full phaseout of fossil fuels by 2050.

• Most of today’s fossil fuel workers will have reached normal retirement age by then.

• Interviews with workers showed that most of them expect to see the industry decline, but are reasonably confident the transition can be managed without mass displacement.

• Federal “just transition” efforts to date have been “long on aspiration and consultation, and short on implementation and effective guarantees.”

• Transition planning in Canada “is made even more nebulous by the fact that no general transition away from fossil fuel production and use is in fact occurring,” except for the 2030 federal mandate to phase out coal.

The research “confirms that an employment transition away from fossil fuel jobs is occurring, and occurring quickly,” said report co-author and centre director Jim Stanford. “Regardless of the twists and turns of climate policy debates, that decline will continue, driven by deeper economic and technological factors.”

But when it comes to just transition planning, “most policies emphasize consultation and dialogue, not binding agreements and entitlements,” the report states. “Instead of clear guarantees of employment and income for affected workers, workers are typically offered retraining subsidies and career counselling. In a labour market defined by chronic insecurity and fierce competition for decent work, this does not convince fossil fuel workers that their employment and incomes will be protected.”

Stanford added that a new oil pipeline megaproject, like the one envisioned in last month’s sweeping memorandum of understanding between Canada and Alberta, won’t reverse the trend. “Building a pipeline creates medium-term construction, he said—but no more than equivalent amounts spent on other energy investments” in renewable energy, transition, energy retrofits, or public transit.

On a global scale, many of those job categories are soaring, the International Energy Agency reported Friday, with the energy sector outpacing the global economy in 2024 for the third year in a row and increasing its work force to 76 million.

“Strong investment in energy infrastructure drove a 2.2% rise in energy jobs last year, nearly double the rate of employment growth for the wider global economy,” the Paris-based agency said in a release, with electricity surpassing fuel supply as the biggest industry employer for the first time.

The IEA reports that:

• Photovoltaic solar has been a “principal driver of demand, accounting for half of the job additions in the electricity sector since 2019.”

• Almost all the jobs in the power sector were in low-emitting power generation, grids, or storage, with only a small percentage in unabated fossil generation.

• Nuclear power, grids, and storage have provided 25% of the new power sector jobs.

• Offshore wind saw layoffs in turbine manufacturing and other “persistent challenge”, leading to a 6% job decline last year.

• Jobs in electric vehicle manufacturing grew by 800,000, with EVs and batteries now accounting for about 40% of automotive employment in China.

• Oil and gas has recovered most of the jobs it lost in the COVID-19 pandemic. But “it now appears that many firms are entering a new period of retrenchment in the face of lower oil prices and revenues, with a number of major oil companies announcing job cuts in 2025.”

• Coal jobs have increased in India, China, and Indonesia, growing 8% between 2019 and 2024.

Skilled worker shortages emerged as a key concern in the IEA’s annual Energy Employment Survey, with more than half of respondents reporting critical hiring bottlenecks and an aging work force compounding the problem.

“Most of the top energy occupations facing constraints within energy are considered applied technical roles, including electricians, pipefitters, electrical power line workers, and engineers, particularly in nuclear,” the IEA wrote. “Many of these broader categories are already in short supply across the wider economy.”

It states: “Lowering our emissions is critical to protecting the competitiveness of Canada’s oil and gas and steel sectors.
The budget has left many wondering about the future of the emissions cap, which the government hints could become unnecessary down the road, but doesn’t outright eliminate.
He said polling shows there’s nothing to suggest the emissions cap is truly controversial in Canada and there is a lot of support for climate action.
We’re still waiting,” Caroline Brouillette, executive director of Climate Action Network Canada, said in a statement shared with the chat.","Disappointment and frustration were common themes among climate champions and experts who joined The Energy Mix for an online chat this afternoon and evening about the new federal budget or shared their comments from elsewhere with us.

“My first take is that neither the tone nor the measures reflect a sense of urgency with regard to climate change, except to the extent there are business opportunities that might be missed,” said Ralph Torrie, research director of Corporate Knights.

Catherine Abreu, director of the International Climate Politics Hub and member of Canada’s Net-Zero Advisory Body, referred to “the dumpster fire that is Carney dismantling Canada’s climate architecture while talking about ‘bargains.’ It’s not a bargain when one side—in this case, the climate—loses everything it has, and the other side—fossil fuel shareholders—gets everything it wants.” Abreu was unable to join the group today, but replied to The Mix’s invitation earlier this week from Rio, where she is already onsite for pre-COP30 meetings.

“We were looking for much-needed clarity on how Ottawa would diversify the economy away from volatile fossil fuels, meet our international climate obligations, and steer Canada towards a safer and more affordable clean energy future. We’re still waiting,” Caroline Brouillette, executive director of Climate Action Network Canada, said in a statement shared with the chat.

“This budget shows that ‘austerity’ applies to efforts to protect people and the planet—but that more money can always be found for military spending and polluting industries,” Brouillette continued. “It fails to make any reference to emissions reductions commitments or Canada’s next international climate finance contribution, announces plans to water down anti-greenwashing legislation, takes another step away from the cap on oil and gas emissions, and cuts international assistance.”

“Today’s budget exposes a missed opportunity for Canada to invest in local economies and urban climate action,” added Bryan Purcell, vice-president of policy and programs for The Atmospheric Fund. “While the federal government reaffirms support for clean electricity and other broad climate measures, the budget offers limited funding or tools to help cities reduce emissions, adapt to climate impacts, or build local resilience. A lack of funding or policy signals to support electric vehicles or energy efficiency leaves struggling domestic industries even more uncertain, and climate targets further out of reach.

“Budget 2025’s Climate Competitiveness Strategy recognizes the economic growth potential of clean energy and the investments needed to bolster Canada’s clean energy sector. While it reaffirms the importance of the Investment Tax Credits, the strategy lacks the ambition needed to keep Canada competitive with leading clean economies. It does little to advance key technologies that could reduce costs for Canadians, such as electric vehicles, heat pumps, and rooftop solar.”

The 14-page document starts with an unequivocal statement: “Climate action is not just a moral obligation—it’s an economic necessity.”

Beyond that, the strategy “shows no commitment to the government’s legal obligation to meet its 2030 GHG reduction targets” said sustainability expert Bob Willard.

Even given Carney’s emphasis on “results, not targets”, the strategy falls short, Willard said. “For an economist and businessman, Carney should know better.”

In fact, the strategy includes plenty of references to targets, Willard said—they’re just thinly disguised as results, without dates attached.

“They provide a lot of wiggle room and room for interpretation, especially the emphasis on carbon ‘intensity’ reductions rather than on absolute reductions.”

The strategy acknowledges the need to cut emissions. It states:

“Lowering our emissions is critical to protecting the competitiveness of Canada’s oil and gas and steel sectors. Reducing emissions is not only essential for environmental reasons, but also a key factor in securing access to markets that prioritise sustainability. By becoming a global leader in clean technology and clean energy, Canada can strengthen its competitive advantage and expand its exports, particularly in sectors where low-carbon solutions are increasingly seen as a requirement rather than a bonus.”

At the same time, it paints an at-times conflicting picture of Canada’s global status, claiming “Canada’s natural resources, workforce, and commitment to fighting climate change position us to surpass economies that fail to adapt,” while including data that seems to reflect a less positive position. GHG emissions from oil and gas production in Canada, according to this chart from the report, are among the highest globally, contrary to the title of the chart.

The budget has left many wondering about the future of the emissions cap, which the government hints could become unnecessary down the road, but doesn’t outright eliminate.

The budget statement reaffirmed the government’s commitment to “bringing down the emissions associated with the production of oil and gas.”

“Effective carbon markets, enhanced oil and gas methane regulations, and the deployment at scale of technologies such as carbon capture and storage would create the circumstances whereby the oil and gas emissions cap would no longer be required as it would have marginal value in reducing emissions.”

Conor Curtis, head of communications at Sierra Club Canada said “people want clear regulations on big polluters.”

“The framing of the emissions cap by the government is straight from the oil and gas corporations, and it’s both wrong and bad communications,” he said.

He said polling shows there’s nothing to suggest the emissions cap is truly controversial in Canada and there is a lot of support for climate action.

“Following the Alberta Government’s unsuccessful campaign against the emissions cap, polling showed the majority of Canadians were aware of the policy, and 67% thought the emissions cap would either make a significant or some impact on climate goals,” Curtis said

He said this is actually a “strength it has versus carbon pricing.” Sierra Club Canada’s position is that “Canadians want a well implemented policy and it’s time to put aside divisions and perfect the emissions cap.”

Curtis said even Albertans say it’s how the cap is implemented that’s important, with as many as 51% of support hinging on the implementation. In Atlantic Canada, 78% either support or say it’s a matter of implementation.

Joe Vipond of the Canadian Association of Physicians for the Environment (CAPE) quipped, “is there any chance the cancelling of the emissions cap will be offset by strengthening the Industrial carbon price? or am I in dream lala land.”

The Mix received a heartening message from Seth Klein and Bushra Asghar of the Climate Emergency Unit:

“After many years of campaigning, we are relieved and heartened to see the Youth Climate Corps (YCC) established in Budget 2025, with a commitment of $40 million over two years. This is a win for hundreds of young activists and allies who have pressed hard for this idea, especially in the context of a budget that is significantly retreating on climate and decreasing overall program spending. But notably, $20 million a year will only produce about 350 full-time jobs for the whole country, which is not terribly consequential for tackling the skyrocketing youth unemployment or addressing the climate crisis. Today’s announcement is a far cry from the $1 billion annual investment our campaign has called for, but it gets our foot in the door to prove the YCC’s worth. So we will roll up our sleeves and work with the government to up the ambition for a Youth Climate Corps that matches the generational challenge.”

George P.R. Benson, senior manager for economic development at the Zero Emissions Innovation Centre said he was nervous to see what’s in store for Canada’s greenwashing rules. “They’re saying they will remove some of the “confusing” aspects of the Competition Act that they just went through the whole process of updating,” Benson said, adding he’ll be tracking what the government removes from the guidelines.

“Today’s weakening of greenwashing rules is more than just a problem for the climate, it is a problem for the security of our democracy,” Conor Curtis, head of communications at Sierra Club Canada, said in a statement he posted to the chat.

Curtis said that the spread of disinformation and climate denial—purposely spread by oil and gas corporations—is contributing to a breakdown of democratic processes in the United States.

“Canada needs strong regulations to ensure that oil and gas corporations—who have large sums of money to spend on influence—are held to the highest possible standard of truthfulness.”

The Energy Mix publisher shared a missive from the Canadian Association of Physicians for the Environment (CAPE), highlighting its key budget takeaways, including one on the Competition Act.

Greenwashing Risks: Removing the Competition Act amendments lets polluters mislead people in Canada and undermines truly sustainable businesses.

Matt Price, Executive Director, Investors for Paris Compliance said in a statement: “The government’s proposal to weaken greenwashing provisions means more investor risk, particularly given the reluctance of provincial securities regulators to enforce accurate and complete disclosure in climate matters.”

Ecojustice’s Karine Peloffy sent out a statement calling for the passage of the Climate-Aligned Finance Act reintroduced in Senate last week. “A failure to implement stronger rules to safeguard the financial and climate systems could open the door to litigation, as illustrated by the recent case against CPP Investments alleging climate-related financial risk mismanagement,” Peloffy said.

“The government should not remove the ability for Canadians to bring allegations of greenwashing directly to the Competition Tribunal, as is proposed in the budget,” Ecojustice lawyer Tanya Jemec said in a statement. “This would leave anti-greenwashing enforcement to the Competition Bureau, which has limited capacity, expertise, and resources.”

Gordon More, executive director of Southeast Techhub in Estevan, Saskatchewan was looking for new funding specifically targeting rural Canada and found none.

He commented that this is “where every single one of these nation building projects will be built.”

“Where do they think the labour force will come from? How will people who don’t have any access to technology training be able to help build, maintain and operate these facilities?” asked More.

He added that it’s “far cheaper to provide rural Canada with the tech training, then to import the skills from elsewhere.”

Luisa Da Silva, executive director at Iron & Earth said she wass “waiting to hear what will move the needle on real affordability for individuals.”

More said the new $1 billion fund-of-funds program is “huge” and will help prevent companies from leaving Canada.

“It also announces a new intellectual property performance review aimed at finding ways to ‘increase domestic investment in leading and high-potential firms’ and ‘help firms protect and commercialise their intellectual property in foreign markets,’” he added, quoting from the budget document.

Bryan Watson, managing director, CleanTech North said he’ll be interested to see how this new program rolls out.

Da Silva asked how vulnerable persons would benefit from the budget. She said she was hoping to see real affordability that “trickles down” to those most vulnerable persons.

“A lot of what has been said here perhaps sounds good for those in urban areas, for those who specialize or for those with professional designations,” she said, “but what about the vulnerable people, or those having a broad set of skills benefits their communities?”

Da Silva is concerned about people in small communities, and rural communities who “wear several hats like sitting on their local council, being the town plumber, and/or holding other unofficial posts.”

“Community resilience is stronger than the individual,” Da Silva said.

Instead of just building more houses, the government must tackle how people access the funding to purchase a home, she suggested. “The government can create a multitude of affordability there that goes beyond the first time home buyers incentives that are completely out of touch with today’s housing prices.”

When the current affordability crisis isn’t mentioned, those experiencing hardships feel forgotten, she added.

More said he’s disappointed there’s “nothing for rural, nothing for Saskatchewan.”

“I hope I am missing something between the lines. I know there is more to it than this document. But I do worry that there is no ‘healing’ mechanism, we are once again left out.”

He said he was just hoping the prime minister would do something different and now wonders if the Conservatives will vote against the budget, adding, an election is “the last thing we need.”

Responding to the budget statement on “expanding the Union Training and Innovation Program to boost union-based apprenticeship training in the Red Seal trades,” Abhilash Kantamneni of the Heating, Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Institute of Canada (HRAI) pointed out “a lot of skilled trades in the clean economy are not unionized (HVAC contractors, for example)”.

And the mention of that support resulting from a 15% savings target over three years coming from a “targeted recalibration of its programs and its approach to delivering them” “sounds “ominous,” Kantamneni said.

Meanwhile, Gordon More, executive director of Southeast Techhub in Estevan, Saskatchewan noted that “funding for labour force development continues to go to urban centres” rather than rural.

“For example, SaskPolytech wants to build the Nuclear Training Facility in Saskatoon—a five-hour trip, one way, from where the actual reactors will be located. When it comes to innovation hubs, almost every budget dollar also goes to urban incubation centres.”

A more effective approach, More said, would be to give Rural Economic Development “an actual budget that can only be spent on economic development for rural regions”.

With major projects planned primarily in rural areas, communities will need funding, resources, and training to handle the massive changes they’ll experience.

“Who’s going to house, feed, police, and provide medical services when you drop 2,500 workers into a community of 10,000 to build one of these projects?”

Carney campaigned on using a new fiscal management framework that splits operational and capital expenditures, George P.R. Benson, senior manager for economic development at the Zero Emissions Innovation Centre, said earlier today. “It’s more or less what it says on the tin—split out more clearly the stuff we build versus the stuff we operate.”

The Parliamentary budget office (PBO) likes this format, Benson added, but it is nervous about the breadth the government is proposing.

It wrote: “Finance Canada acknowledges the breadth of its definition and noted its intent to focus on spending classified as capital investments that would meet conditionality and identifiability criteria.

Finance Canada also identifies 6 categories of federal government spending that would be classified as capital investment.Finance Canada’s definition and categories expand the scope of capital investment beyond the current treatment of capital spending in the Public Accounts of Canada.1 Based on our initial assessment, we find that the scope is overly expansive and exceeds international practice such as that adopted by the United Kingdom.

Specifically, the inclusion of corporate income tax expenditures, operating (production) subsidies and measures to grow the housing stock likely overstate the actual contribution of federal government spending to non-residential capital formation in the economy. That is, federal spending under these categories represents the fiscal cost of related measures and not necessarily the amount of non-residential capital formation that will be undertaken in the economy because of these measures.”

Benson interprets the last line,as the PBO effectively saying: “building housing is good politics, and indeed stimulates investment, but that’s not the same as building wealth-generating infrastructure.”

“The ‘housing-as-investment’ mindset is still a tricky one to break, even if the government owns the assets at the end of the day, Benson said.

Ana Gonzalez Guerrero, an expert on climate finance for municipalities, responded to Benson saying that her concern is “where we are building houses and how much is resilience integrated as a key building principle, because building without resilience in mind is not only hard to justify as “wealth-generating”, but will become incredibly expensive.”

Disappointment and frustration were common themes among climate champions and experts who joined The Energy Mix for an online chat this afternoon and evening about the new federal budget or shared their comments from elsewhere with us.

“My first take is that neither the tone nor the measures reflect a sense of urgency with regard to climate change, except to the extent there are business opportunities that might be missed,” said Ralph Torrie, research director of Corporate Knights.

Catherine Abreu, director of the International Climate Politics Hub and member of Canada’s Net-Zero Advisory Body, referred to “the dumpster fire that is Carney dismantling Canada’s climate architecture while talking about ‘bargains.’ It’s not a bargain when one side—in this case, the climate—loses everything it has, and the other side—fossil fuel shareholders—gets everything it wants.” Abreu was unable to join the group today, but replied to The Mix’s invitation earlier this week from Rio, where she is already onsite for pre-COP30 meetings.

“We were looking for much-needed clarity on how Ottawa would diversify the economy away from volatile fossil fuels, meet our international climate obligations, and steer Canada towards a safer and more affordable clean energy future. We’re still waiting,” Caroline Brouillette, executive director of Climate Action Network Canada, said in a statement shared with the chat.

“This budget shows that ‘austerity’ applies to efforts to protect people and the planet—but that more money can always be found for military spending and polluting industries,” Brouillette continued. “It fails to make any reference to emissions reductions commitments or Canada’s next international climate finance contribution, announces plans to water down anti-greenwashing legislation, takes another step away from the cap on oil and gas emissions, and cuts international assistance.”

“Today’s budget exposes a missed opportunity for Canada to invest in local economies and urban climate action,” added Bryan Purcell, vice-president of policy and programs for The Atmospheric Fund. “While the federal government reaffirms support for clean electricity and other broad climate measures, the budget offers limited funding or tools to help cities reduce emissions, adapt to climate impacts, or build local resilience. A lack of funding or policy signals to support electric vehicles or energy efficiency leaves struggling domestic industries even more uncertain, and climate targets further out of reach.

“Budget 2025’s Climate Competitiveness Strategy recognizes the economic growth potential of clean energy and the investments needed to bolster Canada’s clean energy sector. While it reaffirms the importance of the Investment Tax Credits, the strategy lacks the ambition needed to keep Canada competitive with leading clean economies. It does little to advance key technologies that could reduce costs for Canadians, such as electric vehicles, heat pumps, and rooftop solar.”

The 14-page document starts with an unequivocal statement: “Climate action is not just a moral obligation—it’s an economic necessity.”

Beyond that, the strategy “shows no commitment to the government’s legal obligation to meet its 2030 GHG reduction targets” said sustainability expert Bob Willard.

Even given Carney’s emphasis on “results, not targets”, the strategy falls short, Willard said. “For an economist and businessman, Carney should know better.”

In fact, the strategy includes plenty of references to targets, Willard said—they’re just thinly disguised as results, without dates attached.

“They provide a lot of wiggle room and room for interpretation, especially the emphasis on carbon ‘intensity’ reductions rather than on absolute reductions.”

The strategy acknowledges the need to cut emissions. It states:

“Lowering our emissions is critical to protecting the competitiveness of Canada’s oil and gas and steel sectors. Reducing emissions is not only essential for environmental reasons, but also a key factor in securing access to markets that prioritise sustainability. By becoming a global leader in clean technology and clean energy, Canada can strengthen its competitive advantage and expand its exports, particularly in sectors where low-carbon solutions are increasingly seen as a requirement rather than a bonus.”

At the same time, it paints an at-times conflicting picture of Canada’s global status, claiming “Canada’s natural resources, workforce, and commitment to fighting climate change position us to surpass economies that fail to adapt,” while including data that seems to reflect a less positive position. GHG emissions from oil and gas production in Canada, according to this chart from the report, are among the highest globally, contrary to the title of the chart.

The budget has left many wondering about the future of the emissions cap, which the government hints could become unnecessary down the road, but doesn’t outright eliminate.

The budget statement reaffirmed the government’s commitment to “bringing down the emissions associated with the production of oil and gas.”

“Effective carbon markets, enhanced oil and gas methane regulations, and the deployment at scale of technologies such as carbon capture and storage would create the circumstances whereby the oil and gas emissions cap would no longer be required as it would have marginal value in reducing emissions.”

Conor Curtis, head of communications at Sierra Club Canada said “people want clear regulations on big polluters.”

“The framing of the emissions cap by the government is straight from the oil and gas corporations, and it’s both wrong and bad communications,” he said.

He said polling shows there’s nothing to suggest the emissions cap is truly controversial in Canada and there is a lot of support for climate action.

“Following the Alberta Government’s unsuccessful campaign against the emissions cap, polling showed the majority of Canadians were aware of the policy, and 67% thought the emissions cap would either make a significant or some impact on climate goals,” Curtis said

He said this is actually a “strength it has versus carbon pricing.” Sierra Club Canada’s position is that “Canadians want a well implemented policy and it’s time to put aside divisions and perfect the emissions cap.”

Curtis said even Albertans say it’s how the cap is implemented that’s important, with as many as 51% of support hinging on the implementation. In Atlantic Canada, 78% either support or say it’s a matter of implementation.

Joe Vipond of the Canadian Association of Physicians for the Environment (CAPE) quipped, “is there any chance the cancelling of the emissions cap will be offset by strengthening the Industrial carbon price? or am I in dream lala land.”

That commitment remained at the forefront in 2025 as Cornerstone and its site companies at Cornerstone Energy Park (CEP) invested in local schools and neighborhood initiatives designed to support both the local community and the regional economy.

Throughout the year, CEP focused on modernization, positioning the site for sustainable operations and continued investment. Alongside co-locating site companies, Cornerstone makes in-demand products that increase the longevity of everyday goods, including vehicles and lumber, and processes like water purification and diesel emission abatement. In creating these products, Cornerstone and its site companies aim to reduce their environmental footprint while prioritizing the health and safety of their employees and community.

One major milestone in 2025 was the groundbreaking for a $500 million manufacturing facility for the CEP site company UBE C1 Chemicals America (UCCA).

“UCCA is proud to work alongside cosponsors who share our commitment to community investment and to building relationships with our neighbors. Through this year’s activities, we had meaningful opportunities to strengthen connections within the Waggaman community and continue building relationships that deliver lasting value for the region,” said UCCA President and CEO Tom Yura.

During the groundbreaking ceremony, Yura also announced $50,000 in continued community investments to local organizations.

“UCCA represents exactly the kind of thoughtful, long-term investment we work to attract to Cornerstone Energy Park,” said Jacques Byrd, vice president of site development at Cornerstone. “By announcing direct community investments at the groundbreaking, UCCA underscored that this facility is committed to being a responsible and engaged neighbor in the communities where we live and work.”

That community commitment from Cornerstone and its CEP co-locating companies was seen time and again in tangible ways. When there was a major holiday on the calendar, the companies were there – distributing Easter goodie bags at the Waggaman Community Foundation Easter Egg Hunt, participating in neighborhood Halloween celebrations and providing more than 800 goodie bags to local organizations, restocking shelves with food donations to the South Kenner Food Bank ahead of Thanksgiving, providing meals for the Little Zion Baptist Church Community Thanksgiving Luncheon, contributing to the Waggaman Community Foundation’s River Road Christmas Party and supporting the Live Oak Fire Department Christmas Parade and Party.

Beyond seasonal events, CEP site companies also supported broader civic and community-building efforts in 2025, including:

Through its Cornerstone Scholarship Program, the company awarded 10 eligible local students with $1,000 scholarships to pursue STEM-related degrees at accredited institutions. Another three students received sponsorships to attend the Louisiana Youth Seminar, a weeklong summer camp for high schoolers to develop skills in leadership, communication, goal-setting, team-building, problem-solving and more. And, female high school students were able to connect with women currently working in industrial careers thanks in part to Cornerstone’s participation in the Women in Industry Forum hosted by the New Orleans Region Industry Alliance.

As Cornerstone leaders look ahead to 2026, they view responsible corporate citizenship as an ongoing commitment to listening to community needs and taking meaningful action to strengthen the place where its employees live and work.

He has approved a 90-day pause in offshore wind projects off Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York and Virginia.
Katharine Kollins, president of the nonprofit Southeastern Wind Coalition headquartered in Chapel Hill, is skeptical about the Trump administration’s claim that national security issues are behind the sudden stoppage of wind power projects.
Josh Stein should push to continue the extensive planning and testing needed to expand wind power in North Carolina.
By the time Trump leaves office, North Carolina should be ready to go with the wind.","President Donald Trump’s move this week to pause five major offshore wind power projects won’t affect North Carolina directly, but it represents another setback for tapping one of the greatest wind energy resources on the East Coast.

North Carolina should be among the nation’s leaders in harnessing its strong coastal winds offshore and onshore to generate electricity. Getting there has been stymied by opposition from coastal communities, military and environmental concerns, and a lack of commitment from the state’s largest utility, Duke Energy.

But those issues can be overcome. Offshore wind turbines would be so far off the coast as to be barely visible. Turbine locations can accommodate military concerns about flight paths and radar interference. Offshore turbines elsewhere have not presented environmental threats. Duke Energy, facing growing demands for electricity and pressure to reduce carbon emissions, could see the value of adding more wind power.

That potential turnaround is now further off as Trump has declared war on wind power. He has approved a 90-day pause in offshore wind projects off Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York and Virginia. Some were near completion and all are badly needed.

The pause, ostensibly ordered out of national security concerns, may lead to an extended stoppage. That would not only cost developers of the existing projects, but it would scare off potential investors in future projects.

Katharine Kollins, president of the nonprofit Southeastern Wind Coalition headquartered in Chapel Hill, is skeptical about the Trump administration’s claim that national security issues are behind the sudden stoppage of wind power projects.

“I can’t imagine there’s any validity to it, given the extensive process all these have gone through,” she said. “There are no surprises like that that just come up.”

Kollins noted that China has erected extensive fields of offshore wind turbines without concerns about interference with its defense systems.

Companies that have invested in wind power will go to court to end the stoppage, Kollins said. “I have no doubt that lawsuits will follow,” she said. “There is $30 billion in investment on the line. Companies aren’t going to say, ‘OK.’ ”

Dominion Energy, the utility developing a large wind farm off Virginia, has already filed a complaint in federal court.

What’s really driving the shutdown is Trump’s support of the fossil fuel industry and his personal dislike for wind power. He unsuccessfully sought to block wind turbines near one of his golf courses in Scotland and has repeatedly attacked the “windmills” as unsightly and a hazard to birds.

Trump is letting his bias undermine what should be his first concern – reducing the cost of living. The rapid growth of data centers to support AI development has ramped up the demand for electricity and is putting upward pressure on electricity rates. Adding new sources of electricity would help utilities meet that rising demand and while holding down rates.

While wind power has long been heralded as a way to reduce the use of fossil fuels in power plants, it’s now being recommended as an additional source under an “all the above” approach to electricity generation.

“What has happened is that utilities find themselves in a place where they need every electron they can get,” Kollins said.

Wind power complements solar power among renewable energy sources. While solar power is at its best during sunny days, wind blows stronger at night and during stormy weather.

Beyond its fit among energy sources, wind power also generates construction jobs and has spurred the building of specialized large ships to carry huge turbine parts and lay cable.

The benefits of land-based wind farms are already being realized in North Carolina. The Timbermill wind farm has 45 turbines spread over 6,000 acres in Chowan County in the state’s northeastern corner. It is now the county’s largest single taxpayer even as its presence allows most of the land to still be used for crops.

Trump’s tantrum against wind power means more counties won’t be seeing its benefits. But Gov.

Among the most influential, and often most confusing of these rules, is the definition of “waters of the United States” (WOTUS). Over the past decade, frequent regulatory changes and court decisions have left many farmers questioning what WOTUS really means for their operations. From the start of this debate, the American Farm Bureau Federation has been the leading voice across industry sectors, consistently advocating for clear, practical regulations that protect farmers while ensuring environmental stewardship.

EVOLVING DEFINITION

Under the Clean Water Act, the term WOTUS serves as the threshold that determines which water bodies fall under federal jurisdiction. Unfortunately, the statute offers little clarity on where that jurisdictional line should be drawn. Over the years, the Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (the agencies) have exploited this ambiguity, expanding their authority far beyond what Congress intended when drafting the law.

From the mid-1980s onward, the agencies operated under a regulatory definition that broadly interpreted WOTUS to include many waters. This expansive interpretation repeatedly ran up against judicial scrutiny. The Supreme Court’s decisions on the limits of the federal government’s regulatory reach, in cases such as Riverside Bayview Homes, Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook County, and Rapanos, often created more questions than answers.

For example, the Supreme Court’s 4-1-4 split in Rapanos created conflicting standards for federal jurisdiction. Justice Antonin Scalia’s plurality introduced the “relatively permanent waters” test, while Justice Anthony Kennedy’s concurrence advanced the “significant nexus” test. With no majority opinion, this fractured guidance left regulators and courts without a clear rule, fueling years of litigation and inconsistent interpretations as successive administrations struggled to define WOTUS.

Beginning in 2015, the regulatory uncertainty was exacerbated as different presidential administrations attempted to make sweeping changes, creating a swinging pendulum of regulations. Consequently, the definition of WOTUS became a legal and regulatory maze — one in which wetlands, ditches, seasonal streams, drainage features or even ephemeral streams (low spots in a farm field) could be regulated. Over the last decade, there have been five different rulemakings on WOTUS. The ping-ponging of definitions has produced anxiety and uncertainty for farmers and ranchers whose decisions on the farm depend heavily on clear rules.

SACKETT V. EPA: A TURNING POINT

The 2023 Supreme Court decision in Sackett v. EPA marked one of the most consequential shifts in federal water regulations since the passage of the CWA. This decision greatly narrowed the types of water features and wetlands regulated as a WOTUS and simplified compliance for landowners. The Supreme Court accomplished this by unanimously eliminating the troubling “significant nexus” test, which allowed the federal government to set up a case-by-case regulatory regime that expanded their jurisdictional reach beyond legal boundaries.

Additionally, the ruling greatly restricted the types of wetlands that fall under federal authority by providing proper guardrails for “adjacent wetland.” Farmers and ranchers across the country praised the court’s decision because it is the clearest, most decisive legal standard for WOTUS in decades and appropriately reigns in the federal government’s authority.

UNDERSTANDING THE PROPOSED WOTUS RULE

On Nov. 17, 2025, the Trump administration proposed a new WOTUS definition that implements the Sackett decision and upholds congressional intent under the CWA. The rule represents the greatest narrowing of the federal government’s jurisdictional reach over private property. As directed by the Supreme Court, the proposal only regulates water bodies that are “relatively permanent” — meaning surface waters that flow or stand year-round or those that flow throughout the wet season — and wetlands that are directly abutting a regulated tributary and have a continuous surface connection.

As an example, features like isolated ponds, field-edge depressions, disconnected wetlands, groundwater and many ditches or prior-converted cropland would be excluded. The rule also proposes to define key terms (like “tributary,” “ditch,” “prior converted cropland,” etc.) to bring consistency and predictability to what is “in” and what is “out.” This also reduces the amount of land subject to the regulation, cutting down regulatory costs across the industry.

Most importantly, this rule shifts the burden of proof away from the landowner and places this responsibility squarely on the federal government, meaning a farmer no longer must prove that they do not have a WOTUS on their property to use their land.

It is critical to recognize that this rule upholds the cooperative federalism objective of the CWA by allowing states to serve as the primary authority in regulating water. State governments can regulate far beyond the definition of WOTUS and impose their own, more stringent rules. In many states, just because a water feature is not regulated by the federal government, does not necessarily mean that it goes unregulated.

While this rule is an important step forward in creating a legally durable definition of WOTUS, implementation of the rule may present some challenges. One potential hurdle for some landowners will be determining if there is sustained flow throughout the wet season. In some instances, field-level data may need to be collected, which could significantly slow down the jurisdictional determination process. This also impedes farmers’ ability to use their land, potentially cutting their production and revenue capacity.

COST OF COMPLIANCE

Ensuring compliance under WOTUS for farmers can include several major components that impact a farmer’s cost of production:

Obtaining Clean Water Act federal permits for activities like fencing, drainage or pond construction;

Hiring consultants and technical experts for wetland determinations;

Experiencing operational delays while waiting for permit approvals; and

The cost of mitigation activities which can often be substantial.

Because Clean Water Act compliance carries significant civil and criminal liabilities — up to $64,000 per day or even jail time — it is critical that farmers fully understand the rules to avoid inadvertent violations.

Farmers care about the definition of WOTUS because it determines which ditches, wetlands and water features on their land fall under federal regulation — and therefore which everyday activities may require permits, carry compliance obligations or expose them to legal risk and regulatory costs to ensure compliance. Whether they are installing tile, building a fence, cleaning out a ditch, expanding cropland or managing drainage after heavy rains, the scope of WOTUS directly influences what farmers can do without federal oversight.

European authorities have eased requirements for the transition to electric vehicles, providing much-needed relief to local businesses and thousands of families whose livelihoods depend on the city’s factories. Mayor Jesús Julio Carnero openly expresses his satisfaction: these changes have arrived just as the region is launching major projects to introduce new technologies in the automotive sector.

In recent months, Valladolid has seen several major investment proposals. Chinese company Gotion plans to build a massive battery manufacturing plant here, while Horse has already announced a €71 million investment to develop hybrid systems at its facility. Regional authorities have declared this project a priority to safeguard more than 9,000 jobs, with nearly 2,300 at the plant itself and the rest in related industries.

Investment and jobs

The European Union’s decision to relax environmental requirements from 2035 followed lengthy discussions. Valladolid officials had insisted from the outset on a flexible approach to prevent mass layoffs and the erosion of industrial potential. In September, the city took the initiative to support competitive climate neutrality in the automotive sector, and this approach has now received endorsement at the European level.

In the coming years, not only electric vehicles but also other low-emission technologies will develop in Valladolid: hybrid engines, hydrogen, biofuels, and synthetic fuels. This will preserve market diversity, offer consumers more choices, and give businesses time to adapt.

Industrial potential

The automotive industry is key to the economy of Castilla y León. It accounts for 10% of the region’s GDP and half of its exports. In addition to Valladolid, major car plants operate in Burgos and Ávila. In recent years, the region has actively attracted investments, including from Germany, where demand for Spanish cars and components is rising.

Renault’s Valladolid facility has already started producing new models, including hybrid versions. A new car rolls off the production line every minute, and expansion plans focus on further introducing eco-friendly technologies. Regional authorities have extended Renault’s priority investment project status through 2026 to support modernization and jobs.

Policy and competition

European Parliament member Raúl de la Hoz attended the meeting with auto industry representatives, noting that European decisions are opening new opportunities for the sector. He said previous strict requirements could have triggered a crisis and hurt competitiveness, but now companies have a chance for a smoother transition to new standards.

At the same time, disagreements persist in Spain between the central government and regional authorities. Madrid continues to push for a complete ban on internal combustion engines by 2035, while regional governments and industry leaders are calling for a more flexible approach. Valladolid and Castilla y León advocate for protecting jobs and industrial capacity without giving up on environmental goals.

The Future of the Automotive Industry

The easing of European requirements has served as a call to action for Valladolid. New investments in hybrid technology development have already been approved, and battery production and plant modernization projects have been granted priority status. This will not only support jobs but also enable the region to maintain its leading position in the Spanish and European automotive sectors.

In the coming years, Valladolid will become one of the key sites for testing new technological solutions in the automotive industry. Here, traditional manufacturing facilities will be combined with innovative approaches to reducing emissions, giving the city and region a chance for sustainable development in a changing market.",https://russpain.com/wp-content/smush-webp/2025/12/f.elconfidencial.com_original_a5e_376_246_a5e376246e50d577587e0ed183869bc6-1-1-780x470.jpg.webp,N,,2025-12-28 10:59:45.165172

• Leader & Times

The Liberal City Commission and some members of the community got to hear about an exciting economic development opportunity making its way to Liberal from overseas.

Seward County Development Corporation Executive Director Eli Svaty gave an update to the commission at its most recent meeting last Tuesday evening.

“I actually first would like to apologize for it taking so long to get to this point, I feel like this announcement could have come many months ago – in fact, this was announced in Taiwan back in September,” Svaty began with a chuckle. “If you'll recall, we had a couple projects ready to go last spring, but then they fell apart, so forgive me for being slightly gun-shy with this project and making sure everything was actually in place. This project is a really unexpected opportunity for Liberal. For more than a year now, Scarlette [Diseker] and Jose [Lara] and I have been working with a company out of Taiwan, and in early conversations, we were sitting there thinking 'Why would THIS come to Liberal?' and then as time kept going and the visits kept happening, there was that sense of this project being a great opportunity for the community. In that part of the world, they manufacture pretty much everything, and right now, there's a big push in Taiwan to get some of that manufacturing out for a number of reasons. One reason is tariffs, and another reason is the threat of China, and another reason is that need to be made in the U.S. and a desire to access our markets. As it so happens, we came into contact with one of those companies a little more than a year ago, and we've since been working with them to make that a reality. What's really remarkable is one of the first visits the company's leadership team made was at Pancake Day, which was cold and cloudy and super windy – however, that did not deter them, and they've since made multiple visits when the weather's been much more agreeable.”

Svaty then gave more of the logistical information about where everything will be set up.

“1600 W. Pancake Blvd. is going to be the home of Apogee Power, and they are an advanced manufacturing company for batteries and energy storage systems. Liberal will be the company's first U.S.-based manufacturing of that, and things will happen in three different phases – a Hybrid Power Unit (HPU), a Ground Power Unit, and then the big-scale energy storage systems,” Svaty said. “The building at 1600 W. Pancake Blvd. will be the operations center where they'll do all the marketing, promotion/sales, warehousing and logistics, and the actual cell components will still be manufactured in Taiwan and then sent here, and then the manufacturing base will be where everything is compiled and assembled into the different units. Those operations will be run out of the building at 1600 W. Pancake Blvd. The building has some significant upgrades it will need to undergo like static-free floors and clean rooms and upgrades to the ventilation systems and all of that. I'm really excited to get that building filled and in use and provide them with the space they need.”

Apogee is also certainly no stranger to the energy world, Svaty continued.

“Apogee has been around a long time, and they have locations in Taiwan, Vietnam, and they have sales operations out of Japan, Cambodia, Indonesia, and multiple other parts of Asia. They supply batteries for agricultural equipment from Kubota and other machinery in Asia,” Svaty said. “This company has been contracting in the U.S. for more than 20 years, primarily with the Department of Defense, and because of the quality of their products, they have technology that helps keep them explosion-proof and fireproof, and they also work significantly with the mining industry. I greatly appreciate City of Liberal leadership from the past year, it's been a great opportunity because so much of this is built on that relationship. This is not a typical project for Southwest Kansas, and I know the state is excited because they've been trying to get something out of Taiwan for a while, and we're leading that charge. The initial plan is 20 to 30 jobs and expanding to around 70 within the first couple years, and those jobs will come from our base and bring in people from around the area. Their engineers will come over and train the people and bring everyone up to speed. This is a great way to start showing even somewhere like Liberal can have a global impact and work with companies from around the world. Even more exciting is from the beginning, they said they know of other companies who want to set up operations in the U.S. We are happy to provide that home for this company in Liberal – they need to move some of their manufacturing and need a protected place in the U.S., and we're very excited. We're excited to see this project come to life and see what else they could bring to the table.”

Others also praised the project.

“Liberal definitely has some helpful attributes, such as being centralized, and we've always discussed how we could sell that. This company really liked that, and we also have a bit of security from the coast, which they noticed,” Liberal Mayor Jose Lara said. “At the end of the day, we also get something from the eastern side of the state and the relationships we've fostered there. Having the building available was also very beneficial, and that could lead to other conversations with other potential businesses to set up.”

“There's one of the guys on the Taiwan team I've only met once, but you could really sense the strength of the relationship that was built, and all of this came together because of that relationship,” Commissioner Jeff Parsons added. “Also, we really seemed to be in just the right situation for everything to come together, and I think the strength of this relationship is what's going to help us with attracting other companies that might come after Apogee. It was also really gratifying to see the excitement they have about coming to this part of the world, so kudos to everyone involved with this and all the hard work it took to get everything going.”

“I really think this reinforces the spirit of Liberal and how this truly is the friendliest city in the U.S., and I also have to thank everyone involved for all of their hard work,” Commissioner Janeth Vazquez said.

In other new business, the commission approved a contract and changes with French Construction for the Doll Addition, and also approved Resolution No. 2447 concerning the adoption of the Kansas Homeland Security Region D Local Hazard Mitigation Plan.

The commission also approved minor updates to the Housing Grant Programs funded by the 1-Cent Sales Tax and updated 2026 Facade Grant guidelines, and concluded the meeting’s new business by approving utility billing waivers for Stepping Stone Shelter in the amount of $2,079.98.",https://liberalfirst.com/images/2025/December/Apogee%20Liberal%20location%20courtesy%20photo.jpg,N,,2025-12-28 11:13:28.129723

The partnership in developing renewable energy-based power plant projects is aimed at ensuring that green projects not only obtain financing but are also developed in a planned, integrated manner that is in line with the needs of the national electricity system.

Chief Executive Officer of Danantara Indonesia, Pandu Sjahrir, on Monday, 22 December, emphasised that Danantara’s role in this collaboration goes beyond that of a mere fund provider. According to him, Danantara is also actively involved in identifying various challenges in the development of renewable energy projects, ranging from financing aspects and project readiness to integration with the electricity system.

According to Pandu, this approach is necessary so that the development of new and renewable energy (NRE) does not proceed sporadically, but rather has a clear and sustainable framework. With targeted investment support, green power plant projects are expected to be realised on schedule and have a broad economic impact.

“With this approach, we want to ensure that the development of renewable energy can proceed in a more structured and timely manner, and be integrated with the needs of the national electricity system,” he said.

From the perspective of the electricity system operator, PLN Director-General Darmawan Prasodjo believes that collaboration with Danantara is a key factor in ensuring the sustainability of the energy transition. He emphasised that the transformation towards a clean energy system cannot be achieved by one institution alone, but requires synergy across stakeholders and long-term financial support.

“The energy transition cannot be done alone. Strong collaboration and solid, sustainable financial support are needed,” said Darmawan.

According to him, Danantara’s involvement strengthens PLN’s ability to realise renewable energy power plant projects listed in the Electricity Supply Business Plan (RUPTL). With more structured investment support, PLN is optimistic that the construction of green power plants can proceed according to target and support the reliability of the national electricity supply.

“The presence of Danantara Indonesia strengthens PLN’s efforts to develop renewable energy in a more structured manner, while ensuring that the green projects listed in the RUPTL can run on schedule and provide long-term benefits for the community and the national electricity system,” said Darmawan.

This collaboration is expected to become a model for financing and developing clean energy projects in the future, especially amid increasing investment needs to achieve national renewable energy mix targets. In addition to supporting emission reduction, the development of green power plants is also seen as an opportunity to create new jobs and strengthen Indonesia’s energy security in the long term.

The ovens are a “major source of hazardous pollution,” according to the Environmental Law and Policy Center, which includes toxic chemicals and metals, including lead, mercury and benzene.
The Environmental Law and Policy Center claims that the exemption applied to more than 180 facilities across six industries, including Cleveland-Cliffs’ Indiana Harbor steel facility in East Chicago.
While people living near these toxic coke oven facilities are breathing in poison every day, corporate polluters get another pass.","On Monday, multiple organizations filed a lawsuit challenging exemptions from President Donald Trump’s administration that would allow coke ovens to spew chemicals that lead to hazardous air pollution.

Involved organizations include the Environmental Law and Policy Center, EarthJustice, Just Transition Northwest Indiana, Hoosier Environmental Council and Sierra Club.

“This latest proclamation for coke ovens continues the Trump administration’s year-long practice of undermining industry’s compliance with toxic air pollutant standards by issuing meritless exemptions and delays,” Brian Lynk, senior attorney at the Environmental Law and Policy Center, said in a news release. “The communities who live with these plants and depend on clean and healthy air, in Northwest Indiana and around the country, deserve better.”

Coke ovens are used in steelmaking, heating coal to produce coke, which is used as a fuel. The ovens are a “major source of hazardous pollution,” according to the Environmental Law and Policy Center, which includes toxic chemicals and metals, including lead, mercury and benzene.

In November, Trump issued a proclamation providing regulatory relief for coke ovens nationwide, according to the White House, claiming that a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency coke oven rule places “severe burdens on the coke production industry” and affects American infrastructure, defense and national security.

“Many of the testing and monitoring requirements outlined in the coke oven rule rely on technologies that are not practically available, not demonstrated at the necessary scale, or cannot be implemented safely or consistently under real-world conditions,” the proclamation said. “Due to the coke oven rule’s onerous implementation and compliance schedule for these standards, many coke production facilities are in the impossible position of designing and engineering novel systems with unproven technology within a short time frame.”

It allows a two-year exemption to the coke oven rule because Trump claimed the technology doesn’t exist commercially and cannot allow corporations to comply with the rule. The Environmental Law and Policy Center claims that the exemption applied to more than 180 facilities across six industries, including Cleveland-Cliffs’ Indiana Harbor steel facility in East Chicago.

“The Trump administration is delivering another tough blow to local communities,” Tosh Sagar, senior attorney at EarthJustice, said in a news release. “These unlawful exemptions have real consequences for real people. While people living near these toxic coke oven facilities are breathing in poison every day, corporate polluters get another pass. Corporate profits should not come at the expense of public health.”

According to the Environmental Law and Policy Center, the EPA finalized revisions to the Clean Air Act that introduced the 2024 coke ovens rule, which “introduced a fenceline monitoring requirement, stricter limits on leaks from coke oven battery doors, lids and offtakes, and new emission standards for several hazardous air pollutants.”

Compliance deadlines were staggered between July 2025 and January 2026.

“Communities living near steel industry coke ovens advocated for many years for common-sense federal regulations to protect them from hazardous air pollution,” Haley Lewis, senior attorney for the Environmental Integrity Project, said in a news release. “The EPA’s 2024 rule requiring air monitoring and cleanup of dangerous levels of pollution from coke ovens would have provided meaningful improvements, had President Trump not granted an exemption last month. This exemption should be thrown out by the courts for the sake of the health of all the workers and families living near the industry.”",https://www.santacruzsentinel.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ctc-l-CO2-Lippert019_218509974.jpg?w=1024&h=767,N,,2025-12-28 11:00:08.103461

What's going on?

It's tough to make a living selling EVs in the current environment, and after touting massive EV investment figures in recent years -- like much of the industry -- the Detroit automaker decided it was better to redistribute some of that investment to higher-return opportunities. This week, Ford announced a number of actions that are intended to refocus its Ford+ plan and drive profitable growth.

To take these actions, Ford expects to record roughly $19.5 billion in special items related to a restructuring and a pullback in its full-electric vehicle investments. For investors, it's important to note that most of the charges will take place during the fourth quarter, followed by $5.5 billion to be charged through 2027, with most of that to be paid next year.

These charges will impact the automaker's net results, but it won't alter the company's adjusted earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), the figures Wall Street estimates are based on.

""This is a customer-driven shift to create a stronger, more resilient, and more profitable Ford,"" said Ford president and CEO Jim Farley in a press release. ""The operating reality has changed, and we are redeploying capital into higher-return growth opportunities: Ford Pro, our market-leading trucks and vans, hybrids, and high-margin opportunities like our new battery energy storage business.""

What's in it for investors?

Ford's new plans include an increased focus on hybrid vehicles, including plug-in models, rather than full-electric vehicles, and canceling a next generation of large all-electric trucks in exchange for smaller and more affordable EVs. By the end of this decade, Ford expects about 50% of its global volume to be hybrids, extended-range EVs, and fully electric vehicles, up drastically from 17% in 2025.

Here's what's of interest to investors hoping Ford can quickly reverse its billions in losses driven by its Model e EV business. These changes are expected to provide a path to profitability for Model e by 2029. According to Ford, investors can expect to see annual improvements beginning in 2026. Remember that in 2024, Ford's Model e losses topped $5 billion, and simply breaking even would boost the bottom-line.

Ford also threw a little curveball to investors with its next move. The automaker expects to repurpose its EV battery factory in Kentucky to build batteries to power data centers and energy infrastructure. As the artificial intelligence (AI) boom continues, and the strain on the electric grid from data centers and infrastructure, Ford sees opportunity to capture demand for battery energy storage systems (BESS) and plans to invest roughly $2 billion over the next two years to scale the business.

What it all means

Investors can't know for certain if this huge pivot is the right move, especially considering the next presidential administration could make substantial changes of its own, but they are logical with the market at the moment. These decisions from Ford are massive, and if executed as intended, should pay off for years.

Perhaps the largest takeaway for investors is the change in mindset. Decades ago -- whether you want to call it arrogance, stubbornness, or something else -- Ford likely wouldn't have adjusted its strategy, and could have even doubled down on EVs at the wrong time. Now, however, it's clear Ford is adjusting to land its business where the markets are going, not where we hoped it would be -- and that is a big win.

Bill Gates recently made headlines by suggesting that climate change is no longer a priority, but the American public begs to differ.

In this last election, climate change was a defining issue in states like Virginia and Georgia, where voters grappled with rising energy costs. And no matter how much tech billionaires try to distract us, increasing power costs and our worsening climate are directly connected to corporations like Google, Meta, Microsoft and Amazon racing to dominate the AI landscape.

According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the price of energy has risen at more than twice the rate of inflation since 2020, and Big Tech’s push for more power-hungry data centers is only making it worse.

The data centers proliferating across the country drive up energy costs by powering energy-ravenous generative AI, cloud storage, digital networks and other energy intensive programs — much of it fueled by coal and natural gas that exacerbate climate change.

In some cases, data centers consume enough electricity to power the equivalent of a small city. The wholesale price of electricity in areas housing data centers is up a whopping 267% from five years ago — and everyday customers are eating those costs.

Americans are also shouldering increasing costs of an extreme climate.

The Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard noted that insurance prices rose 74% between 2008 and 2024 — and between 2018 and 2023, nearly 2 million people had their policies canceled by insurers because of climate risks.

Meanwhile, home prices have gone up 40% in the past two decades — meaning the cost of home repair and recovery from climate disasters has also grown, all while wages remain stagnant.

Data centers aren’t just putting our wallets at risk. Power grids across the country are already strained from aging infrastructure and repeated battering during extreme weather events.

The additional pressure to feed energy-intensive data centers only heightens the risk of power blackouts in emergencies like wildfires, deep freezes and hurricanes. And in some communities, people’s taps have literally run dry because data centers used all the local groundwater.

Worse still, Big Tech’s AI energy demand has triggered a resurgence in dirty energy with the construction of new gas-powered energy plants and delayed shutdowns of fossil fuel-powered plants. The tech industry is even pushing for a revitalization of nuclear energy, including the planned 2028 reopening of Three Mile Island — site of the worst nuclear power plant disaster in U.S. history — to help power Microsoft’s data centers.

Everyday people bear the costs of Big Tech’s hunger for profits. We pay it in rising energy bills, our worsening climate, our lack of access to safe water, increased noise pollution and risks to our health and safety.

It doesn’t have to be this way. Instead of raising our bills, draining our local resources and destabilizing our climate, Big Tech could create more energy jobs, lessen our power bills and sustain communities.

We can demand that tech giants like Microsoft, Meta, Google and Amazon uphold their commitments to use 100% renewable energy and not rely on fossil fuels and nuclear energy to power data centers. We can insist that data centers only go where they’re wanted by ensuring communities are given full transparency and protection in how they’re affected by power usage, water access and noise pollution.

The current administration is ignoring its obligations to the American public by refusing to rein in Big Tech. But tech billionaires still have a responsibility to the very public they depend on for their existence.

Tesla’s Real Money Maker: Model 3 and Model Y

When most Americans think about Tesla Inc., they picture two cars: the Model 3 and the Model Y. While the Cybertruck captures the headlines and the Roadster fuels fantasy, it’s these mass-market EVs that still do the heavy lifting for Tesla’s revenue — and by extension, for TSLA shareholders.

Across Tesla’s lineup, the Model 3 and Model Y are the company’s closest equivalent to the iPhone: a scalable, relatively affordable core product that defines the brand and pulls in the bulk of automotive revenue. In the US, they’ve become the default upgrade path for drivers who are done with gas stations but aren’t looking to spend six figures on a luxury EV.

Why Model 3/Y Are Trending Now

Even in a more crowded EV landscape, the Model 3 and Model Y remain front and center in the American market for several reasons:

Price cuts and incentives: Tesla has aggressively adjusted prices over the past year. Combined with federal and state tax credits (where applicable), the effective cost of a Model 3 or Model Y can now directly compete with well-equipped gas SUVs and sedans.

Range and charging ecosystem: With competitive range and access to Tesla’s Supercharger network, these models solve the biggest psychological barrier to EV adoption: range and charging anxiety.

Software-first experience: Over-the-air updates, integrated infotainment, and a minimalist cabin anchored by a central display resonate with buyers who expect their car to feel more like a smartphone on wheels.

Resale and brand status: Tesla’s brand still carries tech-forward cachet. For many buyers, a Model 3 or Y is a visible lifestyle signal — eco-conscious, tech-savvy, and future-oriented.

The consumer problem Tesla solves: The Model 3 and Model Y are designed to eliminate the friction between wanting to drive electric and being able to afford it, charge it, and maintain it easily. They’re the answer to the practical American question: “Can I actually live with an EV, day in and day out, without paying a premium or sacrificing convenience?”

Market Pulse: Simulated Snapshot of TSLA as of Today

As of today’s simulated date, here is a snapshot of Tesla’s stock (TSLA, ISIN US88160R1014) based on a realistic but hypothetical market environment.

Price and 5?Day Trend

Current simulated price: $228 per share

5?day trend: +4.5%

Over the last five trading sessions, TSLA has staged a modest recovery rally after a choppy period of trading. Buyers stepped in around the $215–$220 range, viewing that band as a technical support zone following earlier pullbacks driven by concerns over EV demand softness and ongoing price cuts.

Short-term traders are watching the $230–$235 level as near-term resistance. A decisive break above that band would signal that the current bounce has legs, helped by decent delivery data and renewed enthusiasm around Tesla’s AI and autonomous-driving narrative.

52?Week Range and Context

Simulated 52?week high: $285

Simulated 52?week low: $162

At a current simulated price of $228, TSLA is trading:

About 20% below its 52?week high

Roughly 40% above its 52?week low

That positioning tells a nuanced story. Tesla is no longer priced for perfection the way it was at peak enthusiasm, but neither has it been punished like some smaller EV competitors. The market appears to be in a price-discovery phase, weighing the robustness of Model 3/Y demand against a more competitive EV space and macro headwinds like higher interest rates.

The Time Machine: One?Year Return

Let’s simulate what would have happened if you had bought TSLA one year ago at a hypothetical price of $250 per share:

One year ago (simulated): $250

Today (simulated): $228

The percentage change is:

((228 – 250) / 250) × 100 ? –8.8%

In this hypothetical scenario, a one?year holding period would have produced an –8.8% loss, excluding any trading costs or tax implications. That’s not catastrophic in the context of Tesla’s historical volatility, but it underscores a key reality: owning TSLA is not a smooth ride, even if you believe in the long?term EV transition and the central role of the Model 3/Y platform.

Short?Term Sentiment: Cautiously Bullish

Based on the simulated 5?day uptrend, stabilization above the mid?$220s, and a series of modestly positive news catalysts (more on those below), near?term sentiment can be characterized as cautiously bullish:

Technical traders see a potential base forming after a period of consolidation.

Fundamental investors remain divided: some argue that price cuts jeopardize margins, while others view them as a land?grab strategy to lock in long?term share for Model 3/Y.

Options markets (in this simulated context) show elevated implied volatility around upcoming events like delivery reports and AI?related announcements.

Wall Street Consensus: Simulated Analyst Snapshot

Within the last 30 days (in this simulated environment), major US firms have updated their views on Tesla. While the real world is often more fragmented, the hypothetical snapshot below captures the current tone of institutional coverage.

Goldman Sachs (Simulated)

Rating: Neutral (Hold)

Simulated 12?month price target: $235

Goldman’s analysts are sitting on the fence. They acknowledge Tesla’s scale advantage and brand power in the EV space, particularly through Model 3 and Model Y, but highlight margin compression as a key concern. Repeated price cuts needed to sustain volume growth are likely to cap upside in the near term, in their view.

Morgan Stanley (Simulated)

Rating: Overweight (Buy)

Simulated 12?month price target: $270

Morgan Stanley’s thesis leans more aggressively bullish. The firm argues that the installed base of Model 3/Y vehicles creates a future monetization runway for software, autonomy features, and energy services. They see the current stock price as a reasonable entry point for investors willing to stomach volatility and think Tesla’s software and AI angle is still underappreciated by the broader market.

J.P. Morgan (Simulated)

Rating: Underweight (Sell)

Simulated 12?month price target: $185

J.P. Morgan takes the skeptical side. Their team argues that Tesla’s valuation still prices in best?case scenarios on EV demand, autonomy, and margins, while ignoring intensifying competition from legacy automakers and new entrants. In their view, the Model 3 and Model Y remain strong products, but the stock assumes a level of growth and profitability that will be hard to sustain as the market matures.

Blended picture: The simulated consensus lands somewhere between Hold and Buy, with a wide spread in price targets. That divergence mirrors the broader debate: is Tesla a car company with tech?style expectations, or a tech platform whose Model 3/Y fleet is a Trojan horse for recurring software and services revenue?

Latest News and Catalysts (Last 7 Days, Simulated)

Here is a synthesized view of the kinds of news items that could be moving TSLA in the short term, based on realistic but hypothetical developments from the last week.

1. Model 3/Y Inventory Discounts and Financing Push

In the past seven days, Tesla has rolled out a new wave of limited?time inventory discounts and promotional financing for Model 3 and Model Y in key US markets. Dealers of legacy automakers have been discounting aggressively to clear 2024 models; Tesla’s response is a targeted push to keep order flow healthy into the next quarter.

For consumers, that means a lower effective price and potentially better monthly payments — especially significant in a high?rate environment. For investors, it rekindles concerns about margin pressure, but also reassures the market that Tesla is serious about defending volume leadership in the mass?market EV segment.

2. Software Update: Enhanced Autopilot Features for Model 3/Y

Tesla has also started rolling out an over?the?air software update that enhances driver-assistance features for Model 3 and Model Y owners in the US. While not full autonomy, the update improves lane?keeping, adaptive cruise behavior, and user interface elements related to Autopilot.

This matters because it reinforces one of Tesla’s core differentiators: your car can genuinely get better after you buy it. Each visible improvement helps justify the company’s thesis that the installed base of Model 3/Y vehicles is a platform for recurring software revenue and AI?driven services, not just a one?time hardware sale.

3. Delivery Numbers: Mixed but Resilient

Preliminary (simulated) delivery estimates for the quarter suggest that while Tesla’s overall unit growth has slowed from its hyper?growth phase, Model 3 and Model Y remain the backbone of the business, representing well over two?thirds of total deliveries.

Regionally, US deliveries appear resilient, helped by rebates and inventory pricing actions, while parts of Europe show more softness under competitive pressure. For TSLA, that split is crucial: as long as US demand for Model 3/Y holds up, the stock narrative can lean on the strength of Tesla’s home market even as global conditions fluctuate.

4. Regulatory & Incentive Noise

Within the last week, there has been renewed discussion around EV tax credits and eligibility rules in the US. Some Tesla configurations of the Model 3 and Model Y may see shifting eligibility depending on sourcing and battery component rules. While the impact is nuanced, any change to federal incentives tends to ripple through consumer calculations — especially for price?sensitive buyers cross?shopping hybrids and ICE vehicles.

For Tesla’s stock, the headline risk is simple: if fewer trims qualify for full credits, Tesla may need to lean even harder on pricing or financing incentives to keep its Model 3/Y value proposition compelling.

How Model 3/Y Performance Feeds Directly into TSLA

From an investor’s perspective, understanding Tesla’s stock means understanding the performance of its core products. For now, that is still overwhelmingly about the Model 3 and Model Y.

Revenue and Margin Dynamics

In this simulated context, the majority of Tesla’s automotive revenue and gross profit still flows from Model 3/Y. Every decision to cut prices, adjust trim mixes, or add software features shows up in those models first.

Top line: Healthy demand for Model 3/Y keeps Tesla’s revenue engine running. Even if growth moderates, Tesla still benefits from scale that most EV startups can only dream of.

Gross margin: This is where the market is most sensitive. If discounts and incentives on Model 3/Y outpace cost reductions and software revenue growth, earnings estimates get revised down — and TSLA tends to react quickly.

Operating leverage: The more cars Tesla moves through existing factories, the more it can spread fixed costs and invest in R&D for autonomy, energy products, and next?generation vehicles.

The Optionality Story

Much of Tesla’s premium valuation (even in this more subdued phase) rests on the idea that today’s Model 3/Y fleet is a launchpad for future high?margin revenue streams:

Subscription?based driver assistance and autonomy features

In?car content, connectivity, and services

Energy and grid services using vehicle batteries as distributed storage

If you’re deciding whether to buy the stock after researching “Tesla Model 3 review” or “Tesla Model Y price,” the key is to connect what you see in the showroom to what shows up in Tesla’s financials and valuation. Each Model 3/Y on the road is not just a sale; it’s a potential multi?year, software?enabled revenue stream — at least in Tesla’s thesis.

Is Tesla Stock a Buy, Hold, or Sell If You Care About Model 3/Y?

In the current simulated setup, here’s how the trade?off looks:

Bull case: Model 3/Y remain the dominant mass?market EVs in the US, volume continues to grow or stabilize at high levels, and Tesla successfully layers on software and autonomy revenue. Current price consolidates before another move higher as margins stabilize.

Bear case: Price cuts erode profitability faster than Tesla can grow software revenue, competition catches up on tech and charging, and Model 3/Y lose their pricing power. The stock derates closer to a traditional automaker multiple.

Base case (for many analysts): Revenue keeps growing at a more modest clip, margins normalize at a lower but still respectable level, and TSLA trades in a wide range as the market continually reprices its tech versus auto identity.

Ultimately, whether TSLA belongs in your portfolio depends less on short?term delivery beats or misses and more on your conviction in a simple proposition: Can Tesla keep the Model 3 and Model Y at the center of America’s EV story for the next five to ten years — and turn that installed base into a software and services platform?

If your answer is yes, you’re closer to the Morgan Stanley view. If your answer is no, you’re closer to J.P. Morgan. And if you’re undecided, you might find yourself, like Goldman, in Hold?and?watch mode, waiting to see whether the next wave of buyers still chooses Model 3 and Model Y as their on?ramp to an electric future.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2405001_600_800.jpg,N,,2025-12-28 10:59:51.328252

The repair work now is less about flipping the switch again than rebuilding the system behind it.

What had appeared to be a stable power source for the clean energy transition in Indian Country went dark almost overnight. In February, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin announced — in a scripted YouTube video — that the agency would freeze $20 billion across two programs under the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, a $27 billion allocation created by Congress under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.

By March, Zeldin announced Solar For All — the remaining $7 billion in GGRF funding — was under review. By August, all three programs were terminated, launching a parade of lawsuits against the EPA that continues today.

The GGRF wasn't the only Inflation Reduction Act initiative that, left in place, would have changed the way Indian Country energy financing worked. Elective pay tax credits — once the IRS clarified how they worked and Treasury provided tax certainty around tribal businesses — stood poised to invite substantial private investment into the mix. Those incentives are now set to rapidly sunset.

Altogether, the loss amounts to nearly $2 billion in capital previously headed straight to Native American energy development. Organizations poised to spend millions on workforce development have had to scale back or cancel programs. Projects long in development saw reductions in scope, accelerated plans, or both in a bid to get in under the rapidly approaching July 2026 deadline for getting shovels in the ground and dollars out the door.

Tribes had done what federal agencies had asked: get projects shovel‑ready, build workforce pipelines, assemble capital stacks and prepare to deploy clean energy at scale. When the funding vanished, it wasn’t just a policy shift — it was a collapse of the scaffolding tribes had been told to build on.

But tribal energy development can’t be built on the assumption that federal support will stay put. Tribes, Native-led developers and nonprofit organizations have turned to building financing systems that can survive federal whiplash.

Cheri Smith, chief executive and founder of the nonprofit Alliance for Tribal Clean Energy, said the group is leaning on its Weaver Platform, a project‑finance tool designed to help tribes build capital stacks that rely less on federal grants and more on mission‑driven investors and lenders. The platform is meant to match tribal projects with investors who can stay in the deal even when federal programs shift.

Cody Two Bears, executive director at nonprofit Indigenized Energy, said the Tribal Renewable Energy Coalition is continuing to use its project pipeline — site assessments, engineering and financial modeling — while seeking replacement funding. The work completed by way of federal funding still has value, even if the federal dollars that were supposed to support it have vanished.

At the annual summit of the Native CDFI Network in Washington, D.C. earlier this month, CEO Pete Upton put the stakes in perspective: In Native communities, energy isn't about ideology or politics or red states or blue states, he said. It's about survival. It's about electricity and running water — basics that many Native families still live without.

“A one-size-fits-all energy policy doesn't work in Indian Country,” Upton said. “It's not practical. It's not realistic. And it's definitely not sovereign.”

Federal support hasn't entirely disappeared. While federal programs were terminated or remain tied up in court, Treasury’s final rules on direct pay — released late last year and finalized in mid-December — offered one of the few points of stability. The bigger, energy-focused tax breaks may be on their way out, but New Markets Tax Credits and incentives for building in marginalized communities can still attract partners and developers to the right project, experts told me.

The next phase of tribal energy won’t be defined by what was lost this year, but by what tribes build in response. The Biden‑era surge in tribal clean energy showed what’s possible when federal support aligns with tribal priorities. The Trump‑era reversal showed how quickly that support can disappear. The work now is to build systems that don’t rise and fall on election cycles — systems grounded in tribal ownership, tribal financing and tribal timelines.

The federal pullback slowed the transition, but it didn't stop it. Tribes are already rebuilding, this time on systems designed to hold — even when Washington doesn’t.",https://tribalbusinessnews.com/images/2023/Energy_Rebuild_2025.jpg,N,,2025-12-28 09:12:27.388068

That extra 500 megawatts of “dependable capacity” is “equivalent to powering roughly 200,000 homes,” Susan Edgell, BC Hydro stakeholder engagement advisor, said.
Together with the Mica and Hugh Keenleyside dams, the 1984-built Revelstoke Dam currently provides a quarter of BC Hydro’s power.
On its own, the Revelstoke Dam sources more than 7,800 gigawatt hours – roughly 15 per cent of BC Hydro’s annually generated electricity.
According to BC Hydro, it supplies more than 43,000 gigawatt hours of electricity per year to 1.6 million residential, commercial and industrial customers.","BC Hydro moved forward with big plans for the Revelstoke Dam in September – big enough to power another 200,000 homes.

The provincial electric utility, which sources about 6,880 megawatts (58 per cent) of its total capacity from the Columbia Region, announced last fall that Revelstoke’s namesake dam will be going ahead with the installation and activation of an additional generating unit.

“We’re adding a sixth generating unit at Revelstoke Generating Station to support electrification, meet peak demand, and enable us to add more renewable energy sources to our system,” BC Hydro shared Sept. 21. “We plan to start construction in spring 2026.”

Most notably, however, this sixth unit would unleash another 500 megawatts for the dam, in a 20 per cent rise in capacity from about 2,500 to 3,000 megawatts.

That extra 500 megawatts of “dependable capacity” is “equivalent to powering roughly 200,000 homes,” Susan Edgell, BC Hydro stakeholder engagement advisor, said.

Together with the Mica and Hugh Keenleyside dams, the 1984-built Revelstoke Dam currently provides a quarter of BC Hydro’s power. On its own, the Revelstoke Dam sources more than 7,800 gigawatt hours – roughly 15 per cent of BC Hydro’s annually generated electricity.

“Dams are considered a very clean source of power,” Edgell said.

“They don’t produce greenhouse gases and don’t consume water.

“Water just passes through our generating facilities and creates energy.”

She reported the power that BC Hydro generates being 98 per cent clean and renewable.

However, “in terms of other renewable energy systems, we are in the midst of a second call for power,” she added.

In a “competitive energy procurement process” carrying on from 2024, BC Hydro has sought to acquire electricity purchase agreements by early 2026 for up to 5,000 more gigawatt hours of clean and renewable energy per year, to meet demand for the province’s growing population and industries.

For Revelstoke, following the start of construction on the dam’s sixth unit in spring, the utility expects the project to elapse over seven years, through to the end of 2032.

Failing to meet looming energy challenges puts Pennsylvania at risk of continually rising electricity costs and loss of jobs and economic opportunities to other states — particularly those tied to emerging technologies.
The news on rising energy costs got worse in PJM’s most recent capacity auction that ensures there is an adequate supply of electricity to meet projected future demand.
But given rising demands, costs and emissions inherent in how we currently operate, business as usual won’t meet Pennsylvania’s energy challenges and maintain our place as an innovative energy powerhouse.
To lead, we must act; 2026 must be the year we do what it takes to secure a prosperous clean energy future and protect Pennsylvanians from rising energy costs and the impacts of a changing climate.","It took almost all year, but last month Gov. Josh Shapiro and the General Assembly finally agreed on a state budget. After 135 days of deadlock, it’s understandable that the predominant response to the deal and consequent resumption of funding critical government services has been one of relief. It’s to be expected that leaders are anxious to put the ordeal behind them. But as 2025 comes to a close, it is indisputable that Pennsylvania needs to both confront serious climate issues and reckon with the scale of the challenges we face with respect to energy affordability and reliability.

We at the Pennsylvania Environmental Council supported Pennsylvania’s entry into the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative program — a program abandoned before it was even started in the final budget deal — because we believed that it would help address some of the commonwealth’s energy challenges. These challenges include new, power-hungry data centers and a backlog of new electric generating projects waiting to connect to the regional grid, which remain primary drivers of rising electric bills. We face long-term fuel and operational costs, and foreign markets holding our exports to increasingly higher standards of sustainability. And we need to improve energy efficiency, reduce waste and help families pay their utility bills. RGGI could have been a powerful tool to provide the means to help meet these challenges, and others we’ve only barely begun to consider. It also could have helped with the worsening funding crisis for public transit systems statewide, another priority left unaddressed in budget negotiations.

Failing to meet looming energy challenges puts Pennsylvania at risk of continually rising electricity costs and loss of jobs and economic opportunities to other states — particularly those tied to emerging technologies. The news on rising energy costs got worse in PJM’s most recent capacity auction that ensures there is an adequate supply of electricity to meet projected future demand. PJM operates the grid that serves Pennsylvania and 12 other states, and consumers in that footprint are facing the third consecutive record-breaking increase in electricity costs. Even before this most recent increase, the independent market monitor for PJM indicated that existing ratepayers have already paid $16.6 billion in increased electricity prices for the 2026-27 capacity auction due to existing and forecast data center demand alone.

So, what now?

The benefits of RGGI’s cap-and-invest structure won’t likely be realized with any one policy. But multiple legislative and regulatory proposals are on the table in Harrisburg that can help move the needle on energy affordability, reliability, and emissions. It’s more important than ever that these measures advance with due urgency.

At the top of the list is the Pennsylvania Reliable Energy Sustainability Standard initiative, a long-overdue expansion of Pennsylvania’s antiquated Alternative Energy Portfolio Standards, which PEC has advocated for nearly two decades. PRESS will further diversify the mix of energy sources our power generation system relies on while also reducing carbon pollution. Other elements of the governor’s Lightning package, including updating our state’s energy efficiency program, securing authorization for community energy projects and improving the siting process for new generation build, are also essential. Add to this several good ideas advancing in the House: one helping clear a path for deployment of next-generation nuclear power, and another providing tax credits to help manufacturers save money and cut emissions through energy-efficiency upgrades. Other proposals hold promise for creating energy storage capacity and modernizing transmission systems, which will alleviate grid congestion and make energy delivery and use more predictable and efficient. We also need to explore new energy technologies such as advanced geothermal and find ways to continue building the state’s energy workforce for these new opportunities.

All of these goals are within reach in 2026. But given rising demands, costs and emissions inherent in how we currently operate, business as usual won’t meet Pennsylvania’s energy challenges and maintain our place as an innovative energy powerhouse. Government must lead by providing the right policies and incentives to ensure that Pennsylvania thrives. A sound energy policy can check all of the boxes. Let’s build the technologies of the future here, get more electrons on the grid, reduce emissions, grow our workforce and put investment into making our transmission systems and manufacturing products better. To lead, we must act; 2026 must be the year we do what it takes to secure a prosperous clean energy future and protect Pennsylvanians from rising energy costs and the impacts of a changing climate.

The Republicans’ tax bill reversed or steeply curtailed clean energy programs established through the Democrats’ flagship climate and health care bill in 2022.
The energy storage systems company CMBlu Energy said storage clearly stands out as a winner this year too, moving from optional to essential.
“Trump’s effort to manipulate government regulation to harm clean energy just isn’t enough to offset the natural advantages that clean energy has,” Democratic U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse said.
Landrieu, now with Natural Allies for a Clean Energy Future, said promoting or punishing specific energy technologies on ideological grounds is unsustainable.","There were some highs amid a lot of lows in a roller coaster year for clean energy as President Donald Trump worked to boost polluting fuels while blocking wind and solar, according to dozens of energy developers, experts and politicians.

Surveyed by the Associated Press, many described 2025 as turbulent and challenging for clean energy, though there was progress as projects connected to the electric grid. They said clean energy must continue to grow to meet skyrocketing demand for electricity to power data centers and to lower Americans' utility bills.

Solar builder and operator Jorge Vargas said it has been “a very tough year for clean energy” as Trump often made headlines criticizing renewable energy and Republicans muscled a tax and spending cut bill through Congress in July that dramatically rolled back tax breaks for clean energy.

“There was a cooldown effect this year,” said Vargas, cofounder and CEO of Aspen Power. “Having said that, we are a resilient industry.”

Plug Power president Jose Luis Crespo said the developments — both policy recalibration and technological progress — will shape clean energy’s trajectory for years to come.

Energy policy whiplash in 2025

Much of clean energy's fate in 2025 was driven by booster Joe Biden's exit from the White House.

The year began with ample federal subsidies for clean energy technologies, a growing number of U.S.-based companies making parts and materials for projects and a lot of demand from states and corporations, said Tom Harper, partner at global consultant Baringa.

It ends with subsidies stripped back, a weakened supply chain, higher costs from tariffs and some customers questioning their commitment to clean energy, Harper said. He described the year as “paradigm shifting.”

Trump called wind and solar power “the scam of the century” and vowed not to approve new projects. The federal government canceled grants for hundreds of projects.

The Republicans’ tax bill reversed or steeply curtailed clean energy programs established through the Democrats’ flagship climate and health care bill in 2022. Wayne Winegarden, at the Pacific Research Institute think tank, said the time has come for alternative energy to demonstrate viability without subsidies. (Fossil fuels also receive subsidies.)

Many energy executives said this was the most consequential policy shift. The bill reshaped the economics of clean energy projects, drove a rush to start construction before incentives expire and forced developers to reassess their strategies for acquiring parts and materials, Lennart Hinrichs said. He leads the expansion of TWAICE in the Americas, providing analytics software for battery energy storage systems.

Companies can't make billion-dollar investments with so much policy uncertainty, said American Clean Power Association CEO Jason Grumet.

Consequently, greenhouse gas emissions will fall at a much lower rate than previously projected in the U.S., said Brian Murray, director of the Nicholas Institute for Energy, Environment and Sustainability at Duke University.

Still, solar and battery storage are booming

Solar and storage accounted for 85 percent of the new power added to the grid in the first nine months of the Trump administration, according to Wood Mackenzie research.

That's because the economics remain strong, demand is high and the technologies can be deployed quickly, said Mike Hall, CEO of Anza Renewables.

Solar energy company Sol Systems said it had a record year as it brought its largest utility-scale project online and grew its business. The energy storage systems company CMBlu Energy said storage clearly stands out as a winner this year too, moving from optional to essential.

“Trump’s effort to manipulate government regulation to harm clean energy just isn’t enough to offset the natural advantages that clean energy has,” Democratic U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse said. ""The direction is still all good.”

The Solar Energy Industries Association said that no matter the policies in Washington, solar and storage will grow as the backbone of the nation's energy future.

Nuclear and geothermal had a good year, too

Democrats and Republicans have supported investing to keep nuclear reactors online, restart previously closed reactors such as the Duane Arnold Energy Center in Palo, and deploy new, advanced reactor designs. Nuclear power is a carbon-free source of electricity, though not typically labeled as green energy like other renewables.

“Who had ‘restart Three Mile Island’ on their 2025 Bingo card?” questioned Baringa partner David Shepheard. The Pennsylvania plant was the site of the nation’s worst commercial nuclear power accident, in 1979. The Energy Department is loaning $1 billion to help finance a restart.

Everyone loves nuclear, said Darrin Kayser, executive vice president at Edelman. It helps that the technology for small, modular reactors is starting to come to fruition, Kayser added.

Benton Arnett, a senior director at the Nuclear Energy Institute, said that as the need for clean, reliable power intensifies, “we will look back on the actions being taken now as laying the foundation.""

The Trump administration also supports geothermal energy, and the tax bill largely preserved geothermal tax credits. The Geothermal Rising association said technologies continue to mature and produce, making 2025 a breakthrough year.

Offshore wind had a terrible year

Momentum for offshore wind in the United States came to a grinding halt just as the industry was starting to gain traction, said Joey Lange, a senior managing director at Trio, a global sustainability and energy advisory company.

The Trump administration stopped construction on major offshore wind farms, revoked wind energy permits and paused permitting, canceled plans to use large areas of federal waters for new offshore wind development and stopped federal funding for offshore wind projects.

That has decimated the projects, developers and tech innovators, and no one in wind is raising or spending capital, said Eric Fischgrund, founder and CEO at FischTank PR. Still, Fischgrund said he remains optimistic because the world is transitioning to cleaner energy.

More clean energy needed in 2026

An energy strategy with a diverse mix of sources is the only way forward as demand grows from data centers and other sources, and as people demand affordable, reliable electricity, said former Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu. Landrieu, now with Natural Allies for a Clean Energy Future, said promoting or punishing specific energy technologies on ideological grounds is unsustainable.

Experts expect solar and battery storage to continue growing in 2026 to add a lot of power to the grid quickly and cheaply. The market will continue to ensure that most new electricity is renewable, said Amanda Levin, policy analysis director at the Natural Resources Defense Council.

Hillary Bright, executive director of Turn Forward, thinks offshore wind still will play an important role, too. It is both ready and needed to help address the demand for electricity in the new year, which will become increasingly clear ""to all audiences,” she said. Turn Forward advocates for offshore wind.

That skyrocketing demand ""is shaking up the political calculus that drove the administration’s early policy decisions around renewables,” she said.

BlueWave CEO Sean Finnerty thinks that states, feeling the pressure to deliver affordable, reliable electricity, will increasingly drive clean energy momentum in 2026 by streamlining permitting and the process of connecting to the grid, and by reducing costs for things like permits and fees.

Families are feeling the strain of high utility bills. Our state needs a plan to ensure energy is reliable and affordable now and in the future. And we need an energy grid that can meet the growing demand come rain or shine. That demand will only increase as Florida’s economy adopts energy-intensive technologies like artificial intelligence and supports the growth of new data centers across the state.

State lawmakers have committed to studying every energy option that can lower costs and keep electricity dependable.

That guiding principle is shaping Florida’s energy agenda this year. The goal is not to pick winners and losers. The goal is to prepare Florida for the next generation of energy technology while making sure consumers benefit from lower costs and a stronger, more resilient grid.

An important part of that strategy is ensuring Florida is ready to lead on advanced nuclear energy, especially small modular reactors (SMRs). These reactors represent a new approach to nuclear power that is compact, efficient, and engineered with modern safety features. SMRs produce steady, carbon-free electricity to help meet our state’s long-term needs.

Florida’s legislature has a common sense approach. Lawmakers want to encourage SMR development by creating a clear regulatory environment and removing barriers that slow innovation. It’s also important to lawmakers for new technology to support long-term reliability and not raise costs for consumers.

This thoughtful approach by the Legislature will pay dividends.

SMRs offer clear advantages that support Florida’s energy needs. Their compact size allows them to be installed in more locations than traditional nuclear plants. They can be built in factory-assembled sections, which helps to avoid delays and high costs that have affected past large-scale nuclear projects. SMRs also rely on passive safety features that use natural forces like gravity and circulation. This allows the systems to shut down safely without complicated interventions.

SMRs can also deliver power in places where the larger grid is limited or vulnerable. Rural areas, coastal regions, and communities recovering from hurricanes often struggle when transmission lines fail. A local, steady source of power can be a lifeline for hospitals, water facilities, and emergency operations that need electricity in the most challenging moments.

Preparing for advanced nuclear technology allows Florida to diversify its energy mix and keep consumer expenses in check. A diverse grid is essential for economic growth. Reliable and affordable energy gives businesses room to invest and helps families plan for the future without worrying about unpredictable utility bills.

This effort also supports a broader push for American energy independence. Communities across the country and around the world are turning toward new forms of nuclear power because they want clean energy that doesn’t depend on foreign countries or unstable fuel markets. Florida lawmakers can ensure our state isn’t left behind as these technologies develop.

Florida’s lawmakers are taking meaningful steps to secure our energy future. Their work puts consumers first by encouraging innovation, strengthening reliability, and avoiding policies that raise costs.

Florida has an opportunity to lead this legislative session. By acting now, Florida can build an energy system that supports families, attracts investment and keeps our state competitive.

Why should I care?

For markets: A demand cliff can turn a capacity edge into a pricing fight.

If domestic orders slump, battery giants like CATL and EVE Energy may have to choose between running factories at lower utilization or cutting prices to keep lines busy. With export growth to the EU modest and US shipments shrinking, the industry has fewer outlets for excess supply – which usually means tighter margins across the supply chain, from cathode materials to pack makers.

The bigger picture: Incentives are increasingly deciding whose batteries get bought.

Even when demand is growing, policy can steer it away from certain suppliers. UBS has warned that US investment tax credits can be jeopardized if projects involve designated “foreign entities of concern,” making buyers more cautious about Chinese components.

From smart charging stations and real-time Internet of Things (IoT) networks to advanced mobile apps and battery swapping, technology is fueling an infrastructure boom to support India’s ambitious transition to greener mobility, which is a much-needed switch to improve and preserve environmental health.

As of mid-2025, India’s public charging stations scaled up to more than 29,000 from just 1,800 sites in February 2022. The jump mirrors India’s explosive EV sales; the fiscal year 2025 alone recorded 1.96 million electric vehicles sold, a 17% increase over the previous year. Promisingly so, this rapid expansion is also backed by the PM E-DRIVE scheme, which allocates ₹10,900 crore (USD 1.3 billion) through March 2026 for thousands of new public fast-chargers, including 48,400 dedicated for two- and three-wheelers.

Smart Charging & Digital Innovations

The modern smart charging station integrates multiple technologies for efficiency, security, and user experience:

IoT & Real-Time Data: Sensors at each station monitor electricity flow, charger health, and user data. IoT enables real-time updates on station availability, pricing, energy usage, and remote fault diagnostics, making station maintenance proactive rather than reactive.

Artificial Intelligence (AI): AI-driven backend platforms predict charging demand and optimize load management, preventing grid overload during peak times. Advanced analytics help forecast maintenance, personalize services, and dynamically adjust pricing for different users.

Grid Integration & Renewable Energy: Many stations can now sync with the local grid or even solar panels, balancing local power demand, reducing stress on the grid, and supporting sustainability goals. Dynamic load balancing ensures that several vehicles can be charged efficiently without blackouts or power surges.

User-Centric Mobile Apps: Charging networks are linked to apps that offer real-time station discovery, reservations, remote start/stop functionality, and digital payment options. These apps are critical for end-user convenience, enabling seamless journeys.

Centralizing the EV Experience

Cutting-edge EV charging apps now offer integrated dashboards that provide users with real-time insights and centralized management, eliminating the hassle of switching between different OEM-specific tools. The apps’ advanced features offer EV owners a seamless and empowered driving experience. With the ability to monitor total kms. traveled, users can easily track overall mileage, enabling better journey planning and facilitating predictive maintenance.

Real-time remaining range displays how far the vehicle can go on its current charge, reducing range anxiety and helping drivers plan confidently. Live updates on current charging status allow users to manage their daily schedules and trips more efficiently. Additionally, real-time location tracking not only enhances security but also delivers valuable travel analytics.

Battery Swapping: India’s Unique Tech Solution

In parallel with charging infrastructure, battery swapping technology is fast emerging as a game changer. As of April 2025, more than 2,600 battery swapping kiosks are operational, predominantly in metros like Delhi. The Indian EV battery market is also set to rise sharply, from USD 16.77 billion in 2023 to USD 27.70 billion by 2028.

The technology is empowering users in multifarious ways. Swapping a depleted battery for a fully charged one takes less than two minutes, significantly faster than hours spent at conventional charging stations. By decoupling batteries from vehicle ownership, battery swapping dramatically reduces upfront costs, allowing users to opt for flexible, energy-as-a-service subscription models instead.

For high-use commercial fleets such as delivery bikes and e-rickshaws, this minimizes downtime and maximizes productivity, supporting the surging demands of India’s e-commerce and urban mobility sectors. Further, advanced telematics now monitor each battery’s health, temperature, and performance in real time, enabling operators to proactively predict failures, schedule maintenance, and ensure the highest levels of safety and reliability, all managed remotely.

Miles of shimmering blue panels now blanket the Thar Desert, while millions of urban rooftops hum with subsidized energy.

With this rise, there is also a waste problem. With the first wave of panels approaching their expiration date, a concern looms: Is our clean energy dream destined to become a toxic nightmare?

India lacks both a dedicated national budget and the industrial-scale facilities needed to handle the coming tide of solar panel waste.

Dark side of the bright side

Fueled by government subsidies, nearly 2.4 million Indian households have embraced solar energy, helping solar power account for over 20% of the nation’s energy capacity and reducing coal dependency.

However, this success hides a looming environmental threat.

With a lack of national funding or recycling hubs, India is racing toward a green waste crisis it isn’t yet equipped to handle.

Reportedly, India’s solar waste was estimated at a manageable 110,000 US tons (100,000 tonnes) in 2023, but that figure is a trick of the light. It could rise to 661,386 US tons (600,000 tonnes) by 2030.

According to India’s think tank Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW), the volume is set to explode to over 12 million US tons (11 million tonnes) by 2047.

Tackling the solar waste mountain would require a nationwide network of 300 recycling hubs, backed by a strategic investment of $478 million over the next twenty years.

“The real wave of waste is coming in 10 to 15 years,” Rohit Pahwa of energy company Targray, told BBC.

Most of India’s mega-solar parks were commissioned in the mid-2010s. These modules have a 25-year shelf life, and the countdown has already begun.

Recycling waste

Solar panels contain high-value silver and copper, as well as trace amounts of lead and cadmium.

When panels are smashed in unauthorized scrap yards or tossed into landfills, these toxins seep into groundwater and eventually enter the food chain.

Currently, India’s recycling scene is the wild west of basic recovery.

Workers often strip the easy parts — the aluminum frames and the glass — while the precious, complex materials are lost or released into the environment.

Although India mandated manufacturer-led recycling under the 2022 e-waste rules, enforcement remains inconsistent — particularly for residential panels that often end up in landfills or hazardous, unauthorized scrap yards.

However, the crisis doubles as a massive economic opportunity: high-tech recycling could recover precious metals like silver and silicon, reclaiming 38% of materials for new panels and preventing around 41 million US tons (37 million tonnes) of carbon emissions.

To succeed, experts argue India must spend the next decade professionalizing its recycling sector and holding profitable solar companies accountable for the entire lifecycle of their products.

India’s looming solar waste crisis reflects a global trend, with the US and China also bracing for massive volumes as they expand rapidly. However, regulatory responses vary widely across borders.

India’s energy future looks bright. But to keep it truly green, the nation must find a way to manage the shadows its panels will eventually leave behind.",https://cms.interestingengineering.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IE-12-1.jpg,N,,2025-12-28 02:57:15.885876

Carolina Journal

North Carolina is a story in motion, one that over the last decade has shown what happens when policymakers trust the people, restrain government overreach and put economic opportunity front and center. Here in the Old North State, voters and leaders alike have made meaningful choices that have spurred growth, expanded opportunity and given families greater control over their futures.

We’ve lowered taxes and reduced barriers to success, not by accident, but by design. For years, North Carolina’s leaders pursued a pro-growth tax framework that has helped position our state as a magnet for jobs, entrepreneurship, and innovation, so individuals and families can build a life where work is rewarded, risk is encouraged and prosperity is growing.

That vision of economic freedom was reaffirmed most recently in 2025, when the General Assembly continued to enact laws that expand opportunity, even in the face of divided government. As outlined by the John Locke Foundation’s CEO Donald Bryson earlier this year, several major measures stood out as wins for freedom, each reinforcing the idea that government should clear obstacles, not create them. Those laws opened doors to work by recognizing occupational licenses from other states, making it easier for skilled workers to pursue their calling here; protected privacy and free association by limiting government access to personal donor information; restored balance in energy policy by putting consumers, not government mandates, at the center of the state’s electricity decisions.

A strong economy and a regulatory environment that respects personal choice matter, but freedom is bigger than policy. It is rooted in the idea that each individual should have the dignity to make important decisions for themselves and their families about where to work, how to spend their earnings and how to educate their children.

One of the most consequential expansions of individual choice over the last decade has been in education. North Carolina’s popular Opportunity Scholarship Program is now universally available on a sliding scale by income with the poorest among us served first. Families across income levels are empowered to decide where their children learn best. This isn’t a bureaucrat’s choice or determined by where you can afford to live. It’s a parent’s choice and that makes all the difference. When parents choose schools that fit their children’s needs, education becomes a vehicle for opportunity and personal responsibility and parents become more engaged.

Assuming that parents at all income levels do not want decision rights in their child’s education is inarguably a quiet form of elitism that spurs government-first policy and stifles educational innovation.

But freedom, like students, must be nurtured. That starts with ensuring our children understand not just how government works, but why it works the way it does. As we head into 2026 and the 250th anniversary of the American Revolution, we have the opportunity to celebrate the success of the American experiment by bringing more accurate, idea-rich content into North Carolina classrooms. The John Locke Foundation’s North Carolina History Project, for example, supplies lesson plans focused on the productive role of markets, the importance of private property, and the impact of free-market and religious ideas in shaping our state and nation’s history. This is the kind of civic grounding that helps young people grasp not just the mechanics of government, but its philosophical foundations.

At its best, proper civics education teaches children that freedom is not a passive inheritance, it’s an active commitment. It invites the next generation to understand the sacrifices and ideas that forged our liberties, and to recognize how markets, rule of law and individual initiative have lifted millions out of poverty and given meaning to the American dream.

The work of safeguarding liberty is never over. Policies advance incrementally, bill by bill, stump speech by stump speech, vote by vote. Over the past decade, North Carolina’s steady embrace of lower taxes, regulatory restraint and expanded choice has made our state a place where people can pursue their ambitions with confidence.

As we look to the future, our challenge is clear: We must highlight how these founding values create freedom and economic gains today. That means delivering well-designed civics education, celebrating our history of freedom and teaching each generation why personal liberty matters.",https://www.salisburypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/07/Salisbury-Post.png,N,,2025-12-28 05:57:46.224123

The idea has even caught the attention of Google, which announced a partnership with Energy Dome earlier this year.
Nearby data centers can then tap into the CO2 battery.
Unlike other renewable energy storage solutions, CO2 batteries don’t need special minerals, supply chains for complex parts, or constant upkeep.
“It’s negligible compared to the emissions of a coal plant,” Energy Dome CEO Claudio Spadacini told IEEE Spectrum.","While we’ve made major strides in generating renewable energy, storing that green power to use when the Sun isn’t shining or the wind isn’t blowing remains a major engineering challenge.

Researchers have developed many creative concepts — storing it in cranes that hoist humongous concrete blocks up and down, inside hot giant rocks, or spinning turbines by pumping water out of deep, decommissioned mines — none have yet proved practical enough for wide deployment.

Now, as IEEE Spectrum reports, a Milan-based company called Energy Dome has come up with an intriguing approach that stores energy in enormous domes that are filled with compressed carbon dioxide gas.

The idea behind the “CO2 battery” is simple. By compressing the gas using excess green power, it can later be depressurized to spin large turbines. A fully charged facility can store a formidable 200 megawatt-hours of electricity — enough to power around 6,000 homes for a full day.

To charge, the battery uses a thermal-energy storage system to cool the CO2 down to ambient pressure, and a condenser turns it into a liquid over a span of ten hours. To discharge it, the CO2 is evaporated and heated to power the turbine.

The goal is to bridge the gap between when renewable energy is available and when it’s actually needed through a “long-term duration energy storage” (LDES) solution. For instance, solar energy generation may hit its peak during the day, but peak household demand lags hours behind when people are home in the evening.

The idea has even caught the attention of Google, which announced a partnership with Energy Dome earlier this year. Now, IEEE Spectrum reports that the tech giant “plans to rapidly deploy the facilities in all of its key data-center locations in Europe, the United States, and the Asia-Pacific region.”

Energy Dome is currently working on a pilot CO2 battery built on five hectares of flat land in Sardinia, Italy. If successful, it wants to expand rapidly, popping up similar facilities across the world, starting with a separate plant in Karnataka, India. Authorities are also working on laying the groundwork for another in Wisconsin.

Google’s senior lead for energy strategy, Ainhoa Anda, told IEEE Spectrum that one big benefit of the approach is that it’s one-size-fits-all.

“We’ve been scanning the globe seeking different solutions,” he said, adding that “standardization is really important, and this is one of the aspects that we really like” about Energy Dome.

“They can really plug and play this,” Anda added.

The tech giant is looking to start in places where the electricity grid is already reliable and has a surplus of renewable energy that needs to be stored. Nearby data centers can then tap into the CO2 battery.

Unlike other renewable energy storage solutions, CO2 batteries don’t need special minerals, supply chains for complex parts, or constant upkeep.

And it’s not just Google looking to harness the benefits of LDES. China is also working on constructing CO2 batteries, according to IEEE.

Nonetheless, questions surrounding the concept’s long-term economic viability remain. For one thing, a CO2 battery’s footprint is considerably larger than a lithium-ion battery storage facility. There’s also the shortcoming that plagues all bubbles: the threat of a puncture, which could release thousands of tons of CO2 into the atmosphere.

But proponents argue it’s worth the risks.

What's geothermal? It's a way of extracting heat from underground that can produce electricity in a way that's much cheaper than most energy generation and is easy to harness if done correctly.

The idea is to dig a hole in the ground and you'll eventually get to enough heat that will produce steam and hot water, which can be used to generate power.

And now, University of Texas at Austin researchers say areas of West Texas could see a boom in geothermal energy in the not-too-distant future.

They say there's a possibility that enormous hot rock exists underground, which would mean that exploration of the area could be made simpler by not having to search for underground steam and water to pump electricity generation.

All energy explorers would have to do is find underground areas where the rock is hot, then inject water into it, the way water is very forcefully injected into the ground to stir up oil and force it out of the ground in the fracing industry.

We already know Texas is number one in America for producing oil and gas and is number one in electricity production sourced from wind towers and solar panels, but UT scientists say if research can be done quick enough, the state could become a leader in geothermal energy pretty quickly if ideas are implemented soon.

Geothermal is among the safest forms of energy:

Environmentalists like it because it's clean, with almost no pollution.

Businesspeople and politicians like it because it could result in a whole new industry, producing electricity at a time when data centers and artificial intelligence will demand so much electricity in the next 10 or 20 years that there is already deep worry among many that there soon won't be enough electricity to go around.

And consumers will like it because, if mass produced, geothermal technology could become cheap enough that many people could produce their own electricity in their backyard using a geothermal well to draw on hot rock, water and steam -- once the well is dug, no more paying the electric company.

And most of all, it could prove to be a boon to local communities in the creation of jobs, technologies and new infrastructure.

There are a few concerns, though: it's unknown as yet whether such deep well-digging could influence the number of earthquakes, and many geologists say geothermal energy can't be harnessed and technology can't be rolled out quick enough on a large scale to help with the electricity deficit that power companies across America and the world are already seeing.

Geothermal energy is just one of several newer technologies, like longer-lasting batteries to store electricity for emergency use, that are on the drawing board and offer hope for future breakthroughs, with Texas leading the way, of course.","https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/assets.getty/65dcd42b7252e43218304a33?ops=gravity(%22north%22),fit(1200,675),quality(65)",N,,2025-12-28 01:57:35.776160

“We are intending to break ground on the [US] power plant by 2028-29,” said Charlie Baynes-Reid, Type One Energy’s chief financial officer.
Nuclear fusion differs.
The magnets crush the gas together, and it is then heated to the point where a fusion reaction ignites.
We can now take that basic science and technology, and optimise it for a functional power plant,” Baynes-Reid said.","A nuclear fusion company building a reactor in America says it could have a plant up and running in Australia by the middle of next decade – despite the fact there are no commercial fusion power plants running anywhere in the world.

Fusion reactors try to replicate the conditions inside the sun, using extreme heat and powerful magnetic fields to make atoms fuse together, releasing huge amounts of clean energy. This energy is designed to be stored within a doughnut-shaped magnetic device called a stellarator. In theory, they represent the ultimate source of cheap, clean energy. In practice, there has yet to be a demonstration they work at a commercial scale.

Type One Energy is building a stellarator testbed in Tennessee, where it has signed a letter of intent with the local energy authority to build a 350MW commercial fusion reactor. It says fusion technology is mature and ready for deployment, and could eventually cost as little as $US2 billion ($3 billion) per plant.

Australian fusion experts disagree. There are no commercial nuclear fusion reactors in the world, and only one experiment has successfully generated more power than it consumed – but it looked more like an explosion than a reactor. Major scientific and technical hurdles remain; the CSIRO won’t even consider fusion in its energy modelling.

But that hasn’t dampened a flurry of enthusiasm from entrepreneurs and venture capital funds. Global private investment in fusion is now past the $10 billion mark, with US President Donald Trump the latest to invest – his social media and cryptocurrency company on Friday announced a merger with a nuclear fusion company.

“We are intending to break ground on the [US] power plant by 2028-29,” said Charlie Baynes-Reid, Type One Energy’s chief financial officer. “We would love nothing more than a second or third plant to be built in Australia.

“We feel highly confident that what we’re talking about here is not whether this will work, but just how efficient those power plants will be.”

A star in a bottle

Nuclear fission reactions power conventional nuclear reactors: enriched uranium is bombarded with neutrons, causing atoms to split and release heat. The heat is used to boil steam and spin turbines, while the split atoms fuel a chain reaction that keeps the reactor ticking.

Nuclear fusion differs. Rather than splitting the atom, two hydrogen atoms are fused together into a helium atom, releasing energy. Our sun is powered with the same principle, its massive gravity and extremely high temperatures crushing hydrogen into helium deep in its core.

Fusion reactions release much more energy than fission. There are no greenhouse gases. To quote the International Atomic Energy Agency: “It could provide virtually limitless clean, safe and affordable energy to meet the world’s demand.”

Achieving nuclear fusion itself is a solved problem. In 2018, 12-year-old Jackson Oswalt did it on a homemade reactor in his bedroom.

The real challenge can be boiled down to a simple statement, from emeritus professor John Howard, who oversaw the Australian National University’s experimental fusion reactor for many years: “You are keeping a star inside a magnetic bottle.”

This is as difficult as it sounds. The fusion reaction must be sustained, steady and reliable to provide baseload power.

Loading

Fusion scientists start with plasma – a super-hot swirling gas of atoms that have been stripped of their electrons. The plasma is sensitive to magnetic fields, so huge magnets are used to contain it and send it swirling through the reactor chamber.

Type One is proposing to build stellarators, which look like twisted hollow donuts wrapped in coils of superconducting magnets. The magnets crush the gas together, and it is then heated to the point where a fusion reaction ignites.

The technical challenges are enormous. Stellarators need to survive temperatures exceeding a hundred million degrees kelvin, while keeping the superconducting magnets that surround the chamber below zero.

It can work. The German W7-X stellarator set a record this year for the longest controlled fusion reaction. All that is needed now, says Baynes-Reid, is to scale up the German model to grid-size. One Energy proposes repurposing old shuttered coal plants, which already have grid connections.

Loading

“The fundamental science and technology has been proven. We can now take that basic science and technology, and optimise it for a functional power plant,” Baynes-Reid said.

Other scientists are less optimistic. The W7-X set a record by running for a grand total of 47 seconds.

“I hate being a naysayer. Huge progress has been made. But there’s a few fairly deft tech challenges yet to be solved,” said Howard.

Two stand out. First, for fusion to work, engineers need to prove up tritium breeding.

Fusion reactors run by fusing two special types of hydrogen, deuterium and tritium. Deuterium can be easily extracted from water, but tritium is rare – and radioactive.

A commercial fusion reactor needs to make its own tritium as a byproduct of the reaction, which can then be reused as fuel. This technology is theoretically possible, but scientists are yet to prove it works.

Second, neutrons created as part of the reaction can degrade the components of the reaction chamber. Can you quickly and economically swap them out, while still providing a reliable power supply?

“Their prospectus is fairly optimistic. I’d love to say it was grounded in demonstrated achievements, but that’s not quite the case yet,” said Howard. “Would I put my money into it, if I had any? Probably not.”

Then there’s the timescale problem. Type One believes it could have a working plant up in Tennessee by 2034, replacing the coal plants scheduled to reach the end of their working life over the next decade.

Australia has committed to cutting emissions by between 62 and 70 per cent of 2005 levels by 2035 – a dramatic increase in the pace of emissions reduction, likely requiring 95 per cent of all electricity generation to be renewable within a decade.

ITER, the world’s largest and most powerful experimental fusion reactor, conceived in 1985, has been under construction since 2013 and is projected to cost $US66 billion.

It is designed to reach breakeven, and will test out tritium breeding. But it won’t achieve first plasma until 2034 at the earliest, and won’t be connected to the grid.

“I am a believer. But there is the problem at hand. We’re cooking ourselves alive, and setting up the conditions for crazy rainfall and flooding and sea-level rises. First things first, deal with that with the tech that is available and proven,” said Dr Nathan Garland, a fusion researcher at Griffith University.",https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.7874%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_54%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/q_86%2Cf_auto/420256724b6d90603c0eefff98b1c3e88e2061bd,N,,2025-12-27 20:57:06.390497

Ramping up production would also help the EU reduce its reliance on China, the current global market leader in rare earths. Norway is leading the region in rare earth production, as other EU countries begin to invest in new production operations.

Several rare earth elements, alongside critical minerals, are needed to produce a wide range of renewable energy equipment, including wind turbines, solar panels, and electric vehicles (EVs), as well as the magnets used in artificial intelligence (AI) hardware and other electronics. At present, Europe relies heavily on imported minerals to meet its demand. China dominates the global rare earths supply chain, producing around 95 percent of the world’s rare-earth oxides and supplying 70 percent of Europe’s imports.

The EU’s domestic rare-earth production is almost non-existent at present. Therefore, China provides around 98 percent of Europe’s rare-earth magnet demand, as well as similar proportions of magnesium, gallium, and germanium, used in semiconductors and defence technologies. This year, China made export licenses stricter, reducing magnet exports by around 75 percent, leading automakers across Europe to halt production. This demonstrates the heavy reliance the EU has on China for rare earth imports.

Europe recently introduced the EU Critical Raw Materials Act, aimed at reducing reliance on foreign supply chains for extraction, processing, and recycling rare earths. In December, the EU also introduced an Economic Security Doctrine, with the aim of making Europe’s industry more self-sufficient. The strategy includes a plan for critical raw materials, entitled ResourceEU.

As the EU looks to expand its rare earths production capacity, several countries are investing in operations. The Belgian-French firm Solvay, which has been processing all 17 rare earths in its plant on France’s west coast for around 80 years, plans to expand its facility to respond to the growing demand. The French government is investing around $23 million in tax credits to support the expansion.

“This is a market that is growing fast, and, also, there is a greater demand for shorter supply chains,” said Solvay’s CEO Philippe Kehren. “When you have a material that is coming almost 100 percent from one specific location, if you are dependent on this, you want to diversify your sourcing. This is what we can offer,” explained Kehren.

Solvay’s facility is one of only two facilities in Europe that process rare earths, alongside another plant in Estonia. Until now, Solvay has processed rare earths for catalytic converters. However, as the demand for magnets across several of Europe’s rapidly expanding industries grows, the investment in the facility will help meet this demand.

Solvay plans to focus on recycling rare earths that are already in Europe and expects to be able to produce around 30 percent of the rare earths needed in the region solely from recycling end-of-life motors and other equipment. However, eventually it is expected to need to source the rare earths from mineral-rich regions of the world, such as Brazil, Canada, and Australia, as there are currently no operational rare earth mines in Europe.

In Norway, Rare Earths Norway is supporting the ResourceEU strategy with a new project in the south of the country. In June 2024, the company announced the discovery of Europe’s largest known rare earths deposit, giving hope for potential self-sufficiency. It’s Fen Carbonatite Complex is thought to hold 8.8 million metric tonnes of total rare earth oxides, and around 1.5 million tonnes of these are thought to contain the most vital magnet-related rare earths.

The company is currently pursuing approval for development and hopes to deliver its first rare earths by the first half of the 2030s. The firm has also appealed to domestic and EU policymakers to consider fast-track permitting. Rare Earths Norway aims to extract the resources using an “invisible mine” technique, which requires the drilling of a long, narrow tunnel diagonally underneath the village of Ulefoss and refilling extracted voids with waste materials, to reduce the environmental impact.

Meanwhile, in Sweden, the state-owned mining firm LKAB is developing its own rare earths project in the Arctic Circle in the city of Kiruna. In January 2023, the firm announced that it had discovered what it thought to be Europe’s largest known deposit of rare earths, close to the world’s largest underground iron ore mine. LKAB plans to move thousands of residents to a newly developed city centre to expand its conventional mining operations, so long as the expansion of the mine is deemed economically viable.

The recent discovery of rare earth deposits in Norway and Sweden offers hope to Europe, which aims to become more self-sufficient in rare earths mining and processing and reduce reliance on foreign powers such as China. The expansion of a processing facility in France will help quickly alleviate the supply-demand gap while the Nordic facilities are being developed, although the EU will also likely need to invest in mining operations in other parts of the world to boost its supply.

The Chinese have been developing an ultimate green facility to secure the country’s position as a leader in the global hydrogen production market. As China shifts its focus to the future capacity of 1,500,000 tonnes of green energy in the desert, one cannot help but be in awe of the benefits it has in store not only for China but also on a global scale. Discover more about China’s historic breakthrough in the desert below.

Goodbye to hydrogen after China’s historic discovery

China has shown that achieving long-term carbon neutrality is not an impossible feat, especially with the assistance of short-term climate targets. According to the World Resources Institute, China has set the goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2060, and has updated its 2035 climate targets to include the following:

Have EVs become mainstream in sales

Boost forest stock volume

Boost wind and solar capacity to more than 6 times the 2020 capacity

Decrease greenhouse gas emissions by 7-10% compared to peak levels

>30% non-fossil fuel share in energy consumption

By late 2025, China managed to boost its green hydrogen capacity to surpass 220,000 tonnes annually. Now, thanks to an ultimate green facility and a future capacity of 1,500,000 tonnes of a hydrogen carrier in the desert, China can easily achieve carbon neutrality by 2060, if not earlier. Find out more below.

1,500,000 tonnes of this green energy in the desert

A Chinese company called Envision Energy has developed the ultimate green facility in the Net-Zero Industrial Park located in Inner Mongolia’s Chifeng City, near the Gobi Desert. This facility will be the biggest green ammonia and hydrogen production facility in China. Envision Energy’s facility will be a milestone in the country’s large-scale decarbonization.

The Chifeng facility is unique compared to others of its kind, as all production is powered solely by renewable energy sources, solar and wind energy, which is stored in batteries. Exports of green ammonia were planned for the final quarter of 2025, with the entire facility set to expand over three phases to achieve 1,52 million tonnes of green ammonia annually.

Expanding in three phases

Phase 0

Launching 20,000-ton pilot phase in March 2024

Phase 1

Produce 300,000 tonnes of green ammonia annually by September 2025

Phase 2

Start construction by August 2025

Increase annual production by 320,000 tonnes, starting in November 2026

Phase 3

Increase annual production by 900,000 tonnes

Reach full-scale production of 1,52 million tonnes annually by 2029

China will greatly benefit from this green energy

Beyond the Chifeng facility operating with zero emissions thanks to renewable energy sources, it is also the world’s ‘smartest’ facility. AI plays a vital role in operations management, balancing energy supply and demand in real time. The facility will also be beneficial for China’s export market, as Envision Energy has already secured an offtake deal with Japan’s Marubeni Corporation.

In this deal, green ammonia is exported for sectors such as:

Chemicals

Fertilizers

Shipping

According to the China Hydrogen Bulletin, other export purposes include transporting green ammonia by railway to Envision’s 80,000 cubic meter liquid ammonia storage and processing facility in Jinzhou port. This facility’s construction started in June 2024 and is still under development. Inner Mongolia is also planning to construct a 4,400 km green hydrogen pipeline network along with a 299 km ammonia transportation pipeline between Chifeng and Jinzhou.

The economic and environmental benefits for China are thus endless. Most importantly, this pioneering facility will significantly boost China’s energy security and play a major role in global decarbonization, bringing the world one step closer to achieving the global mission of achieving net-zero by 2050. While Envision Energy continues to develop the Chifeng facility, China is also juggling more than 20 other hydrogen ventures in its refreshed clean energy expansion.",https://energiesmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/gobi_amo_2009073_lrg.jpg,N,,2025-12-27 21:12:29.732120
